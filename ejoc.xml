         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>n&#8208;Bu4NI/K2S2O8&#8208;mediated C&#8208;N coupling between aldehydes and amides is reported. A strong electronic effect is observed on the aromatic aldehyde substrates. The transformylation from aldehyde to amide takes place exclusively when an aromatic aldehyde bears electron&#8208;donating groups at either the ortho or para position of the formyl group, while the cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling dominates in the absence of these groups. Both the density functional theory (DFT) thermochemistry calculations and experimental data support the proposed single electron transfer mechanism with the formation of an acyl radical intermediate in the cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling. The n&#8208;Bu4NI/K2S2O8 mediated oxidative cyclization between 2&#8208;aminobenzamide and aldehydes is also reported, with four quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones prepared in 65&#8208;99% yields.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
The facile and safe synthesis of acyl fluorides, under metal&#8208;free and cost&#8208;effective conditions, presents a remarkable advance in organic synthesis. These versatile reagents, endowed with distinct reactivity owing to the fluorine atom, offer a wealth of possibilities for further utilization.







Abstract
Acyl fluorides have emerged as versatile reagents in various synthetic endeavors, offering a range of advantages over their counterparts, acyl chlorides. This study delves into the properties and reactivity of acyl fluorides, particularly their reaction with amines and alcohols, to elucidate their distinct characteristics. We also introduce a facile and practical synthesis of acyl fluorides from a stable solution of CF3O&#8722; salt. Additionally, we establish an efficient one&#8208;pot process for the direct preparation of amides or esters from corresponding acids and amines or alcohols, showcasing the remarkable efficiency of acyl fluorides in these transformations.

         <title>Aerobic Photoredox Catalyzed Oxamate Ester Synthesis from Bromodifluoroacetate Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel synthetic method for oxamate esters using bromodifluoroacetate esters and amines under aerobic photoredox catalysis. In contrast to previous methods that require the use of moisture&#8208;sensitive precursors and/or harsh conditions, this method utilizes bench&#8208;stable bromodifluoroacetate esters as an oxamate ester precursor under mild conditions, providing a variety of oxamate esters.







Abstract
Here we report an aerobic photoredox catalysis approach to oxamate ester synthesis using bromodifluoroacetate esters and amines under open&#8208;air conditions. Oxamate ester is an important skeleton found in bioactive molecules and used as a synthetic building block. However, previous synthetic methods require the use of moisture&#8208; and air&#8208;sensitive precursors and/or harsh conditions, limiting accessible oxamate esters. The present method uses bench&#8208;stable bromodifluoroacetate esters and amines under mild photoredox catalytic conditions to furnish a wide variety of oxamate esters. Combining photoredox catalysis with aerobic oxygenation enables the use of bromodifluoroacetate ester as a precursor for the synthesis of oxamate esters via fluoroglyoxylate esters.

         <title>TBAI&#8208;Catalyzed, TBHP&#8208;Mediated Modular Three&#8208;Component Cascade Towards Highly Functionalized Pyrrole via [3+2] Annulation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, one&#8208;pot sequential synthesis of highly substituted pyrrole under the metal&#8208;free condition catalyzed by TBAI/TBHP was demonstrated. &#946;&#8208;Enaminone generated in&#8197;situ from &#946;&#8208;ketoesters and primary amines reacts with electron&#8208;deficient alkynes to synthesize penta&#8208;substituted pyrroles.







Abstract
A facile, one&#8208;pot sequential synthesis of highly substituted pyrrole employing TBAI/TBHP has been developed from readily available precursors. &#946;&#8208;Enaminones generated in&#8197;situ from &#946;&#8208;ketoesters and primary amines react sequentially with electron&#8208;deficient alkynes via a radical pathway to form the penta&#8208;substituted pyrroles in moderate to good yields. This strategy for the synthesis of highly functionalized pyrroles can be scaled up and shows tolerance to a variety of amines.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NIS/TEMPO&#8208;mediated procedure for the C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reaction of tertiary amines with trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) and nitroalkanes was developed. The N&#8208;Mannich base formed from the tertiary amine and NIS had a stabilizing effect on the iminium intermediate.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free N&#8208;iodosuccinimde (NIS)/2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyloxy (TEMPO)&#8208;promoted protocol was developed for the oxidative cyanation and nitro&#8208;Mannich reaction of tertiary amines via a cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reaction under mild conditions. Several control experiments were performed; the coupling reaction outcomes indicated that the C&#8722;N coupled intermediate (N&#8208;Mannich base) formed from the tertiary amine and NIS had a stabilizing effect on the iminium cation.

Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced metal&#8208;free three&#8208;component amidoheteroarylation of alkenes to synthesize &#946;&#8208;(hetero)arylethylamines







Abstract
Herein, visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced metal&#8208;free three&#8208;component amidoheteroarylation of alkenes with quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and N&#8208;sulfonylaminopyridinium salts is developed. This protocol involves a radical relay process in which the N&#8208;centered radicals undergo chemoselective addition to alkenes to form an alkyl radical that selectively combines with heteroarenes, leading to the formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds in one step under mild reaction conditions. The involved high efficiency and selectivity, wide substrate scope, and excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility demonstrate the practicability of the developed protocol.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, visible-light-induced metal-free three-component amidoheteroarylation of alkenes with quinoxalin-2(1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-ones and N-sulfonylaminopyridinium salts is developed. This protocol involves a radical relay process in which the N-centered radicals undergo chemoselective addition to alkenes to form an alkyl radical that selectively combines with heteroarenes, leading to the formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds in one step under mild reaction conditions. The involved high efficiency and selectivity, wide substrate scope, and excellent functional-group compatibility demonstrate the practicability of the developed protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A New Strategy for the Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Crambescin B Decarboxylate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(+)&#8208;Crambescin B decarboxylate was synthesized using a new synthetic strategy, which is nine steps shorter than the previously reported shortest method. We determined its cytotoxicity and protective effects in neuronal HT22 cells with an MTS assay. Cell viability was observed to decrease in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner without cell detachment or shrinkage. Additionally, the compound protected glutamate&#8208;induced cell death.







Abstract
Crambescin B decarboxylate is an inhibitor of voltage&#8208;gated sodium channels and a potential biochemical tool. Herein, we report the asymmetric total synthesis of crambescin B decarboxylate using a new synthetic strategy. The key aspects of this new protocol include: 1) the use of an optically pure epoxide, synthesized by the Jacobsen hydrolytic kinetic resolution, as the starting material for guanidino&#8208;aziridine, and 2) the introduction of the THF ring through nucleophilic substitution using an acyl anion equivalent. The synthetic protocol reported herein is nine steps shorter than the previously reported shortest method. We determined the cytotoxicity and protective effects of crambescin B decarboxylate in mouse&#8208;hippocampus&#8208;derived neuronal HT22 cells with an MTS assay. Cell viability was observed to decrease in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner without cell detachment or shrinkage. In addition, crambescin B decarboxylate protected glutamate&#8208;induced cell death.

         <title>Hexafluoroisopropanol Promoted Ring&#8208;Opening&#8208;Cyclization of Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropanes with Primary Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free, ring&#8208;opening&#8208;cyclization reaction of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes with primary amines is reported with HFIP.







Abstract
We reveal here a catalyst&#8208;free, ring&#8208;opening&#8208;cyclization of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes with primary amines to synthesize functionalized dihydropyrroles. This protocol avoids inert conditions and solvents promoted by hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP). The reaction is quite general with aryl, alkyl, and alicyclic amines. A good number of cyclopropanes bearing keto groups reacted excellently to produce the desired products. Further, we complemented this method with Meldrum's acid&#8208;derived cyclopropanes for synthesizing &#947;&#8208;lactams. We have demonstrated the post&#8208;synthetic applications of the products and gram&#8208;scale synthesis to highlight the adaptability of this synthetic protocol.

         <dc:description>
Phosphine&#8208;catalyzed chemodivergent reactions of p&#8208;QMs have been developed. The direct 1,6&#8208;addition of p&#8208;QMs with thiols was catalyzed by P(4&#8208;FC6H4)3, while P(4&#8208;MeC6H4)3 catalyzed the tandem addition/self&#8208;aldol condensation reactions of p&#8208;QMs with 1,4&#8208;dithiane&#8208;2,5&#8208;diol. Furthermore, one of the products diarylmethyl thioether was shown to have an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of all cancer cell types in the study.







Abstract
Phosphine&#8208;catalyzed chemodivergent reactions of para&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) affording a wide variety of diarylmethyl thioether derivatives have been reported. In the transformation presented in this work, P(4&#8208;FC6H4)3 catalyzed the direct 1,6&#8208;addition of p&#8208;QMs with thiols, whereas P(4&#8208;MeC6H4)3 promoted the tandem addition/self&#8208;aldol condensation reactions of p&#8208;QMs with 1,4&#8208;dithiane&#8208;2,5&#8208;diol. Moreover, some of the obtained products were screened against cancer cell lines HepG2, NB4, and K562, and one was found to inhibit the proliferation of all the tested cancer cell types.

         <title>Uranyl&#8208;Organic Framework as Hydrogen Atom Transfer Catalyst for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Heterogeneous Hydroacylation of Azodicarboxylates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A uranyl&#8208;organic framework with a 2D structure has been synthesized, which exhibits excellent catalytic activity for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven heterogeneous hydroacylation of azodicarboxylates. The yields of the desired products were up to 99%, and the catalyst could be recycled 7 times without a significant decrease in activity.







Abstract
The direct C&#8722;H to C&#8722;N bond conversion at room temperature using heterogeneous visible&#8208;light catalysts is both interesting and challenging. Herein, we disclosed visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted hydroacylation of azodicarboxylates using uranyl&#8208;organic framework [UO2(OH)(cpt)]n (Ucpt, Hcpt=4&#8208;(4&#8242;&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole) as an efficient heterogeneous hydrogen atom transfer photocatalyst. In this procedure, diverse benzaldehydes are compatible using dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as a green solvent at room temperature, achieving direct conversion of C&#8722;H to C&#8722;N bond with excellent yields (up to 99%). The key to excellent catalytic activity lies in the fact that the coordination of the conjugated ligand changes the HOMO energy level of Ucpt, resulting in more active sites and longer&#8208;lived photo excitons. Simultaneously, this heterogeneous photocatalyst can be easily separated and reused for seven successive cycles and maintain high catalytic activity, showing outstanding sustainability and recyclability.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of sustainable protocols for the synthesis of alkylated heteroarenes is crucial owing to their widespread existence in medicinally relevant and bioactive natural products. Herein, we describe an efficient, additive&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free approach for the regioselective C&#8722;H alkylation of indoles and azoles with alkenes using a nickel catalyst, which proceeds through a chelation&#8208;assistance strategy. The reaction exclusively provided branched alkylated products with the compatibility of alkyl, alkoxy, fluoro, trifluoromethyl, alkene, cyano, ester, and carbonyl groups. This protocol is applicable to other heteroarenes, such as imidazoles and benzimidazoles, providing the desired alkylated products with exclusive Markovnikov selectivity. The synthetic utility and scale&#8208;up of the reaction are demonstrated, and the protocol is in concord with the principles of green chemistry. Alkylation proceeds through facile and reversible C&#8722;H nickelation and alkene insertion processes, presumably involving rate&#8208;limiting reductive elimination.</dc:description>

The monocationic and dicationic species could be selectively generated, depending on the type of oxidizing agents used. Spectroscopic and X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses revealed the radical cation was in a unique charge/spin delocalized class III mixed&#8208;valence state due to an exquisite balance between the electronic effect by the oxygen&#8208;bridges and the rigidity of molecular framework.</dc:description>

         <title>Systematic Investigation of Optical and Chiroptical Properties of Chiral &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Oligomers in Solution and Thin Films</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four families of structurally related chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated oligomers bearing a hydroquinone (HQ), 1,5&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene (Naph), benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophene&#8208;4,8&#8208;diol (BDT) or 9H&#8208;carbazole (CBZ) central core, for a total of 11 new compounds, have been synthesized by simple and versatile synthetic strategies involving Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling protocols: a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction, a Sonogashira/desilylation/Sonogashira sequence or a Sonogashira/desilylation/acyl Sonogashira sequence. A systematic investigation of the optical and chiroptical features of the final chiral dyes was performed in chloroform solution and on spin&#8208;coated thin films. The ECD investigation was crucial in revealing that, even within the same family of organic dyes, minor variations in the nature and length of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone can result in very different solid&#8208;state arrangements at different hierarchical scales.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Artemisinin G from Artemisinin via Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoredox catalysis has become a mainstay in synthetic methodology over the past decade. Herein, an efficient method for the synthesis of artemisinin G from artemisinin by using 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% of TBADT as the catalyst was reported. The reaction proceeds smoothly and rapidly (complete within 30&#8197;min) at room temperature in high yield.







Abstract
Photoredox catalysis has become a mainstay in synthetic methodology over the past decade. However, its application in the functionalization of natural products remains to be further explored. Herein, we report an efficient approach to synthesize artemisinin G from artemisinin via photocatalysis in high yield.

         <title>A Simple Device for Automated Mixing of Heterogeneous Solid&#8208;Liquid Reactions During In&#8208;Situ Monitoring by NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plunger&#8208;based device has been developed for the automated mixing of heterogeneous solid&#8208;liquid reactions in a 5&#8197;mm tube inside a standard NMR probe. The plunger design, plunger velocity, settling time, and mixing&#8208;to&#8208;acquisition time ratio are explored by NMR and UV&#8208;Vis to determine the optimum parameters for reaction kinetics to be monitored in&#8208;situ.







Abstract
In&#8208;situ NMR spectroscopy can provide valuable insight into chemical reactions, including detailed information on reaction kinetics and thus mechanism. The application of in&#8208;situ NMR techniques to heterogeneous reactions has so far been limited by the requirement for efficient mixing, which is challenging within the confines of a standard NMR spectrometer. We report an automated plunger&#8208;based device for the mixing of heterogeneous solid&#8208;liquid reactions conducted within a 5&#8197;mm tube in a standard NMR probe, allowing reaction kinetics and speciation to be monitored in&#8208;situ. The system has been tested by measuring the kinetics for three diverse reactions and comparison of these with the reaction velocities measured by routine ex&#8208;situ analysis after sampling. The effect of key parameters including plunger design, plunger velocity, solid settling time, and mixing&#8208;to&#8208;acquisition time ratio are explored to determine the optimum parameters for combining efficient mixing with spectral quality. With adaptation, the device may also be suitable for benchtop NMR.

         <dc:description>A formal [4+2] cycloaddition reaction of ethynylethylene carbonates and 2&#8208;aminophenols has been developed for the synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[b][1,4]oxazines bearing quaternary carbon atoms. The reaction features mild reaction conditions, good functional group compatibility and good yields. Furthermore, when using chiral PyBox ligand, this strategy could also achieve the asymmetric synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[b][1,4]oxazines. Application studies indicated that the hydroxymethyl group of final products was an excellent functional group that can be further modified easily.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Imidazole&#8208;based Hydrazonoyl Cyanides and Amidrazones Containing N(N,O)&#8208;Heterocycles: Selective Synthesis, Reaction Mechanisms and Preliminary Anticancer Evaluation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two series of novel hybrid heterocyclic compounds that combine the imidazole ring with bioactive piperidine, morpholine or piperazine heterosystems, through a hydrazone unit, were easily obtained by two competitive pathways. Starting from 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoformimidoyl imidazoles and 1&#8208;aminopiperidine, 4&#8208;aminomorpholine or 1&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;methylpiperazine under mild acidic media led to the selective synthesis of 5&#8208;aminoimidazole 4&#8208;carboxamidrazones, whereas the corresponding 4&#8208;hydrazonoyl cyanide derivatives were obtained under stronger acidic conditions. These highly functionalized imidazoles provide convenient synthetic precursors to a vast array of heterocycles with potential pharmaceutical applications. The reaction mechanisms were elucidated on the basis of experimental assays and in silico calculations. The compounds were screened against colorectal cancer HCT116&#8208;p53 wt cell line, and significant IC50 values of 3.69 &#181;M and 4.83 &#181;M were obtained.</dc:description>

Abstract
We present a method for the synthesis of substituted indolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoline&#8208;5(6H)&#8208;ones starting from 1&#8208;(2&#8208;ethynylphenyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indoles. The transformation involves gold&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of the triple bond followed by acid&#8208;promoted intramolecular cyclization at the indole C2 position. Demonstrating noteworthy versatility, the reaction tolerates a wide array of substituents on the indole core and proceeds in good to excellent yields (up to 93&#8201;%).

Asymmetric Michael addition of 4&#8208;monosubstituted&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones to simple enones is realized on capitalization of iminium activation mode of organocatalyst. The pyrazolone derivatives featuring vicinal all carbon quaternary and tertiary stereocenters, were obtained in good to excellent stereoselectivities.







Abstract
Pyrazolone moiety bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereogenic center is frequent in biologically active products and pharmaceuticals. The catalytic route for the construction of quaternary carbon centers poses a formidable challenge . In this report, catalytic asymmetric Michael addition of 4&#8208;monosubstituted&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones to simple enones catalyzed by primary amine&#8208;Br&#248;nsted acid composite has been developed. An array of pyrazolone derivatives bearing vicinal all carbon quaternary and tertiary stereocenters, were obtained in moderate to good diastereoselectivities (up to 92&#8201;:&#8201;8 dr) and good to excellent enantiomeric excess (up to 99&#8201;% ee). In addition, antipode for enantiomers of the pyrazolone derivatives were also realized in good to high stereoselectivities (up to 92&#8201;:&#8201;8 dr and up to 98&#8201;% ee).

         <title>Practical and Selective Syntheses of S&#8208;Acyl and N&#8208;Acyl Glutathiones with N&#8208;Acyl Imidazoles in Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a simple and efficient glutathione acylation reaction for the chemoselective synthesis of S&#8208; or N&#8208;acylated glutathione derivatives, under mild conditions and using water as the solvent, by means of the in&#8208;situ formation of acyl imidazole electrophiles from the respective abundant carboxylic acid.







Abstract
A selective, mild, convenient, and green protocol for the preparation of S&#8208;acyl and N&#8208;acyl glutathiones is described involving the chemical modification of glutathione (GSH) with N&#8208;acyl imidazoles at room temperature in water. The syntheses of S&#8208;acyl glutathiones were achieved in very high yields using 1 equiv. of an N&#8208;acyl imidazole in water at room temperature, without the need of a base. Double acylation of GSH with various N&#8208;acyl imidazoles in weakly basic aqueous media in the presence of N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (HOSu) as the activating reagent followed by selective deprotection of the S&#8208;acyl group with aqueous ammonia at room temperature gave high yields of N&#8208;acyl glutathiones. Moreover, the reaction could accommodate a diverse range of carboxylic acids such as (hetero)benzoic acids, phenylacetic acids, aliphatic acids from short&#8208;chain fatty acids (including acetic acid), long&#8208;chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, secondary or tertiary amino acids, and carboxylic acids containing clickable functional groups, fluorescent probes, or drugs.

         <title>Hypersensitive Inhibition of Organocatalysts by Halide Salts: Are Two Catalysts Involved in the Mannich Reaction?</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conformationally flexible tertiary amine&#8212;thiourea&#8208;urea catalysts 1 and 2 for the Mannich reaction between imines and malonate esters are efficiently inhibited by quaternary ammonium halides. NMR titrations, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and NOE experiments showed that the catalysts bind chloride and bromide ions with relatively high affinities (K = 103&#8211; 105 M&#8211;1 in acetonitrile). The halide ions not only block the active site of the catalysts, but they also refold into catalytically inactive conformations upon complexation in an allosteric&#8208;like event. At substoichiometric inhibitor:catalyst ratios, the catalysts displayed hypersensitivity to the inhibitors, with overall rates that were lower than those expected from simple 1st order kinetics and 1:1 inhibitor:catalyst stoichiometry. To rationalize the observed hypersensitivity, different kinetic scenarios were examined. For catalyst 2 and the Takemoto catalyst (6), the data is consistent with 2nd order dependency on catalyst concentration, suggesting that a mechanism involving only a single catalyst in the catalytic cycle is not operative. For catalyst 1, an alternative scenario involving 1st order in catalyst and catalyst poisoning&#160;could also rationalize the hypersensitivity. Inhibition of catalysts 1 and 2 by halide salts led to significant loss of enantioselectivity, but Takemoto catalyst 6&#160;was inhibited&#160;with essentially no change in enantioselectivity.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Conformationally flexible tertiary amine&#8212;thiourea-urea catalysts 1 and 2 for the Mannich reaction between imines and malonate esters are efficiently inhibited by quaternary ammonium halides. NMR titrations, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and NOE experiments showed that the catalysts bind chloride and bromide ions with relatively high affinities (K = 103&#8211; 105 M&#8211;1 in acetonitrile). The halide ions not only block the active site of the catalysts, but they also refold into catalytically inactive conformations upon complexation in an allosteric-like event. At substoichiometric inhibitor:catalyst ratios, the catalysts displayed hypersensitivity to the inhibitors, with overall rates that were lower than those expected from simple 1st order kinetics and 1:1 inhibitor:catalyst stoichiometry. To rationalize the observed hypersensitivity, different kinetic scenarios were examined. For catalyst 2 and the Takemoto catalyst (6), the data is consistent with 2nd order dependency on catalyst concentration, suggesting that a mechanism involving only a single catalyst in the catalytic cycle is not operative. For catalyst 1, an alternative scenario involving 1st order in catalyst and catalyst poisoning&#160;could also rationalize the hypersensitivity. Inhibition of catalysts 1 and 2 by halide salts led to significant loss of enantioselectivity, but Takemoto catalyst 6&#160;was inhibited&#160;with essentially no change in enantioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Low&#8208;Impact Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Lactones Through Photoinduced Baeyer&#8208;Villiger Oxidation of Cyclic Ketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photocatalyzed oxidation of functionalized cyclobutanones to access g&#8208;lactones has been performed in acetonitrile at room temperature, using anthraquinone derivatives as catalysts in the presence of TFA. The best reaction results were obtained by using 3 mol % of 9,10&#8208;anthraquinone as a catalyst under 370 nm irradiation in an O2 environment. The scope and the limitations of this reaction have been investigated using both 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;substituted cyclobutanones, as well as enantiopure ketones, to obtain full preservation of their stereochemical identity after the oxidation. The process furnishes in most cases the desired compounds with high purity after catalyst removal by simple filtration, and reducing the production of solvents waste.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Copper&#8208;Free Sonogashira Coupling in Water and under Ambient Atmosphere</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sonogashira coupling is one of the cornerstone Palladium mediated cross coupling reactions, giving a direct and high yield access to symmetric and non&#8208;symmetric alkynes with high tolerance of substituents. The method generally requires the use of CuI as a cocatalyst, an inert atmosphere to protect palladium catalyst, somewhat harsh conditions like prolonged heating and the use of organic solvents due to the hydrophobicity of reagents and products. Leveraging on the opportunities offered by micellar catalysis, we here present a general methodology to perform Sonogashira coupling in water, with moderate or no heating, under air, without copper co&#8208;catalysts and at very low catalyst loading. The method offers the same generality and scope of organic solvents based couplings, but strongly improves sustainability while offering excellent yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and Electronic Impacts of the Axial Substitution at the Phosphorus Center of C(sp3)&#8208;Bridged P&#8208;Heterotriangulenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structural and electronic properties of the dimethylmethylene&#8208;bridged P&#8208;heterotriangulene have been systematically modulated by functionalization of its phosphorus center. The optoelectronic properties of the obtained derivatives in solution were characterized by UV/Vis absorption and emission spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and 31P NMR spectroscopy. The solid state structures were analyzed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The experimental results were corroborated by density functional theory calculations which revealed the crucial influence of the axial substitution on the bowl&#8208;shaped geometry of the phosphorus&#8208;centered polycyclic scaffold, which is proportional to the s&#8208;character of the P&#8211;X bond. The advantage of the bowl&#8208;shaped P&#8208;heterotriangulene scaffold was demonstrated by successful co&#8208;crystallization with fullerene C60.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of 2&#8208;(Alkylsulfanyl)quinolines from Aryl Isothiocyanates and Allenes or Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 13, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and convenient approach to new families of variously substituted 2&#8208;(alkylsulfanyl)quinolines, which are difficult to access via traditional methods for quinolines synthesis, is reported. Allenes or alkynes, aryl isothiocyanates, and alkylating agents have been shown to be readily available building blocks for the one&#8208;pot assembly of functionalized quinoline systems.







Abstract
In this work, a conceptually novel approach to diversely substituted 2&#8208;(alkylsulfanyl)quinolines is described. The approach includes the assembly of the target molecules from allenic or acetylenic carbanions, aromatic isothiocyanates, and alkylating agents. The process proceeds in a single synthetic operation via the formation and 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization of N&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;aza&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;trienes, R2R3C=C=C(R1)C(SAlk)=NAr, with the participation of the carbon&#8208;carbon double bond of the phenyl group and the azadiene fragment of the azatrienic system.

         <title>A Short Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;6,7&#8208;Secoagroclavine via Metal&#8208;Free Reductive Coupling</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 13, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two Csp3&#8722;Csp2 and Csp3&#8722;H bonds are formed on the same carbon atom by reacting the tosylhydrazone of chiral Uhle's ketone with 2,2&#8208;dimethylethenylboronic acid. This metal&#8208;free reductive coupling afforded an unexplored disconnection for the asymmetric synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;6,7&#8208;secoagroclavine.







Abstract
A concise, convergent, and enantioselective synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;6,7&#8208;secoagroclavine, a pivotal intermediate in the synthesis of both clavine and ergot alkaloids, was accomplished from a derivative of the renowned Uhle's ketone. The synthesis is centered on metal&#8208;free reductive coupling of the tosylhydrazone derivative of protected 4&#8208;amino Uhle's ketone and commercially available 2,2&#8208;dimethylethenylboronic acid, which is used as a four&#8208;carbon building block. This novel approach directly sets the stereochemistry on the difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access aryl vinyl methane carbon stereogenic center of (&#8722;)&#8208;6,7&#8208;secoagroclavine.

         <title>Synthesis of Methylenecyclobutenes by [2+2] Cycloaddition of Allene Ethers and Alkyne</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 13, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylenecyclobutenes are synthesized via thermal conditions between allene ethers and alkyne and successfully transformed to other four&#8208;membered ring compounds. This strategy provides a series of methylenecyclobutenes in moderate yields with broad functional groups.







Abstract
Methylenecyclobutenes are useful precursors to provide other organic compounds. We report intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of allene ethers and alkynes at 100&#8201;&#176;C, which gives methylenecyclobutenes in 50&#8211;60&#8201;% yields. The reaction does not require any metal catalyst and shows broad substrate scope, high regioselectivity and high stereoselectivity.

         <title>Thiophane&#8208;Catalyzed Umpolung of N&#8208;Bromoimides for Dibromination of Olefins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 13, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a thiophane&#8208;catalyzed dibromination of olefins using NBS as the sole bromine source, wherein a new type of catalytic umpolung strategy of N&#8208;bromoimides is revealed. The mechanistic investigation revealed that in&#8197;situ generated 2,3&#8208;dihydrothiophene was the actual catalyst, which was responsible for the catalytic umpolung of NBS.







Abstract
A thiophane&#8208;catalyzed dibromination of olefins using NBS as the sole bromine source has been developed, providing a low&#8208;cost and mild methodology for preparing vicinally dibrominated compounds from electron&#8208;neutral or &#8208;deficient alkenes. The mechanistic investigation showed that 2,3&#8208;dihydrothiophene generated in&#8197;situ from the reaction of thiophane with NBS was the actual catalyst, which reversed the polarity of NBS to yield bromide ion.

         <title>Continuous Preparative Application of Amine Transaminase&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions with Integrated Crystallization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 13, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ product crystallization (ISPC) was used to semicontinuously remove chiral amines from amine transaminase catalyzed reactions. The use of a constant mild vacuum facilitated the synthesis of six compounds in this way in a preparative fashion at gram scale with yields of up to 80&#8201;%. The process included intermittent removal steps of the product salt and the replenishment of substrates every 24&#8197;h







Abstract
Transaminases are valuable catalysts in the synthesis of chiral amines. However, secondary techniques are typically required to shift the reaction equilibrium to the product side. This study focuses on the in&#8197;situ product crystallization, specifically at preparative synthetic scale as a non&#8208;synthetic tool for a selection of aromatic and aliphatic substrates using the transaminase from Silicibacter pomeroyi. Herein the technique is implemented in a simplified manner to facilitate in&#8197;situ product removal and downstream&#8208;processing in a combined crystallization step. After a series of optimizations, product concentrations of &gt;0.9&#8197;mol/L and &gt;99&#8201;% e.e. (S) were obtained implementing a repetitive batch reaction approach using a universal carboxylate as anion.

The reactivity of cyclic &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyls (cyclic &#946;&#8208;diketones, 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2(5H)&#8208;furanones, and Meldrum&#8216;s acids) towards metal/hydroperoxide system was disclosed. An efficient method for the peroxidation of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2(5H)&#8208;furanones and Meldrum's acids with TBHP has been developed using Co2+ salt as a catalyst. Cycle cleavage, expected from previous reports for cyclic &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyls, was observed only for cyclic 1,3&#8208;diketones.

Abstract
A Co&#8208;catalyzed peroxidation of cyclic &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyls (cyclic 1,3&#8208;diketones, 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2(5H)&#8208;furanones and Meldrum's acids) with TBHP has been disclosed. A series of the alkylperoxy derivatives of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2(5H)&#8208;furanones and Meldrum's acids were synthesized in moderate to good yields (13&#8211;86&#8201;%). The functionalization of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2(5H)&#8208;furanones by the tBuOO group was performed with high selectivity in the presence of the cocktail of reactive oxidizing species, including metal and radical intermediates. The key species in the peroxidation process are probably the tert&#8208;butylperoxy radical or its Co(III) complex, which are generated from the Co(II)/TBHP system. Cycle cleavage, which would be expected for cyclic &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyls based on previous reports, was observed to a large extent only for cyclic 1,3&#8208;diketones.

         <title>Exploiting Hydroxamic Acids as Organocatalysts for the Epoxidation of Alkenes with Hydrogen Peroxide as the Oxidant</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 13, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalytic epoxidation of alkenes synthesis is presented in which hydroxamic acids are used as the catalyst and hydrogen peroxide as the green oxidant. Mechanistic studies by direct infusion HRMS provide experimental evidence for the formation of various intermediates.







Abstract
The epoxidation of alkenes has altered and reshaped the way scientists think in modern organic synthesis. Herein, a novel, sustainable and eco&#8208;friendly protocol for the epoxidation of alkenes is reported, utilizing hydrogen peroxide as the green oxidant and, for the first time, hydroxamic acid derivatives as the organocatalyst. The presented methodology is very effective, leading to good to high yields for the oxidation of a variety of olefins, while various functional groups are well tolerated. Mechanistic studies utilizing direct infusion high resolution mass spectrometry (DI&#8208;HRMS) provide strong evidence for the mechanism of the organocatalytic oxidation.

         <title>Reactivity of Electrophilic Trifluoromethylating Reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 13, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The second&#8208;order rate constants for the reactions of Umemoto's reagents I (X=H) and II (X=F) with carbanions follow the correlation lg k2=sN(N+E) and allow to calculate their electrophilic reactivity parameters E. The reactivities of Togni's hypervalent iodine&#8208;based CF3 transfer reagents do not follow this correlation.







Abstract
Kinetics of the reactions of colored carbanions (reference nucleophiles) with S&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)dibenzothiophenium ions (Umemoto's reagents) and hypervalent trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted iodine compounds (Togni's reagents) have been determined photometrically using stopped&#8208;flow techniques. The second&#8208;order rate constants k2(20&#8201;&#176;C) for the reactions of Umemoto's sulfonium ions (generation I and II) with the reference nucleophiles in DMSO follow the correlation lg&#160;k2(20&#8201;&#176;C)=sN(N+E) and can be used to determine the electrophilicity parameters E of these trifluoromethylating reagents. It is shown that the conditions reported for the reactions of Umemoto's generation I reagents with a variety of C&#8208;nucleophiles are in line with the electrophilicity parameter E&#8776;&#8722;13 determined for these reagents. Though Togni's hypervalent iodine&#8208;based trifluoromethylation reagents do not follow this linear free energy relationship, the kinetics of their reactions with carbanions indicate that they cover the same reactivity range as Umemoto's generation I and II reagents.

         <title>Synthesis, Structures, Electrochemical and Optical Properties of Vinyl&#8208;Extended Tetrathiafulvalene Derivatives Functionalized with Two 2,6&#8208;Dicyano&#8208;&#955;5&#8208;Phosphinine Units</title>

Derivatives of vinyl&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene functionalized two 2,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;&#955;5&#8208;phosphinine units have been successfully synthesized, and characterized by X&#8208;ray structural analyses, cyclic voltammetry, absorption, and emission spectroscopies.







Abstract
Derivatives of vinyl&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) functionalized with two 2,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;&#955;5&#8208;phosphinine units (3&#8201;a&#8211;c) have been successfully synthesized. Cyclic voltammograms of all the derivatives are composed of three pairs of redox waves. The first and second redox waves correspond to one&#8208;electron transfer processes, in which the extended TTF moiety participated predominantly. The third redox wave corresponded to a two&#8208;electron transfer process, in which the two 2,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;&#955;5&#8208;phosphinine units were involved. The redox potentials at which the tetracations of 3&#8201;a&#8211;c were generated were considerably more negative than expected, probably due to the formation of stable closed&#8208;shell structures by conjugation between 2,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;&#955;5&#8208;phosphinine units. X&#8208;ray structural analyses of 3&#8201;b, 3&#8201;c, and (3b2+)(Sb2Cl82&#8722;)(C6H5OCH3) revealed that the vinyl&#8208;extended TTF moiety in all the compounds adopts an almost planar structure, while the phosphinine units are significantly rotated relative to the extended TTF plane. The fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the emission intensity of 3&#8201;b was very small in both the neutral and oxidized states.

         <title>Direct ortho&#8208;Selective Amination of Naphthols with Nitroarenes through Transfer&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 13, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient transition&#8208;metal free synthesis of ortho&#8208;arylaminonaphthols from nitroarenes has been developed for the first time using alcohols or ethers as a hydrogen donor.







Abstract
Hydrogen atom transfer from commonly used solvents to nitroarenes occurred. Such solvents required C(sp3)H&#8208;C(sp3)H bond adjacent to oxygen atoms, such as 1,4&#8208;dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, alkanol, ethylene glycol, glycerol and bis(2&#8208;methoxyethyl) ether. The transformation was transition&#8208;metal free and the reduced nitroarenes were trapped by naphthols and their analogues at ortho&#8208;position. The protocol provided a favourable and efficient route to access ortho&#8208;arylaminonaphthols and a possible mechanism is depicted.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Fluoroamide&#8208;Directed Remote C(sp3)&#8208;H Bond Functionalization Through Intramolecular Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 13, April 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the recent years, copper&#8208;catalyzed fluoroamide&#8208;directed remote C(sp3)&#8208;H bond functionalization via intramolecular HAT has served as a robust and elegant strategy for the assembly of a variety of functionalized (sulfon)amides and related derivatives. This review focuses on the recent advances in this area. These transformations usually exhibit high efficiency, excellent selectivities and good functional group compatibility.







Abstract
Direct C&#8722;H functionalization is an important strategy for the rapid synthesis of valuable organic molecules. Radical&#8208;involved remote C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization based on hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) becomes an important method enabling selective direct transformation of C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds at specific distal position(s). In the recent years, copper&#8208;catalyzed fluoroamide&#8208;directed remote C(sp3)&#8208;H bond functionalization through intramolecular HAT has served as a robust and elegant strategy for the assembly of a variety of functionalized (sulfon)amides and related derivatives. This review focuses on the recent advances in this area. These transformations proceed effectively with high selectivities and good functional group compatibility under mild conditions.

         <title>Tf2O&#8208;Promoted Synthesis of Ureas, Carbamates and Thiocarbamate via Lossen Rearrangement: A Mechanistic Insight</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new and feasible synthetic method for ureas, carbamates and thiocarbamate from hydroxamic acid and Tf2O via Lossen rearrangement has been developed. The use of Tf2O was chemoselective with hydroxamate group with broad substrate applicability and good functional group tolerance. Further pathway of the mechanism was analysed through computational studies.







Abstract
Herein, we report triflic anhydride mediated synthesis of ureas starting from hydroxamic acids. The scope of triflic anhydride was also expanded to encompass carbamates. In addition, this reaction is applicable to activation of hydroxamic acid derivative of dipeptide giving &#945;&#8208;uriedopeptidomimetics in good yield. The mechanistic study of reaction was carried out by DFT. This study is important because it demonstrates that Tf2O has the potential to be effective when used on a substrate that possesses amide bond. A broad substrate scope and mild conditions render this protocol a promising approach to the synthesis of diverse types of ureas.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Cinnamylamines Via the Heck Reaction: Application in the Synthesis of Abamine, Naftifine and Reboxetine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both cinnamylamines and their saturated counterparts are important pharmacophores in medicinal Chemistry. A new Heck protocol has been developed that uses as little as 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% Pd and following Boc deprotection and salt formation, pure trans&#8208;cinnamylamines may be isolated at gram scale without need for chromatography. The methodology was applied to chromatography free syntheses of three pharmaceutically important molecules.







Abstract
Following an extensive screening of reaction parameters such as the nature and amount of bases, Pd pre&#8208;catalysts, ligands, additives, solvents and temperature range, we succeeded in developing a Heck reaction using N&#8208;Boc&#8208;allylamine and commercially available aryl bromides, capable of delivering a wide range of Boc&#8208;protected trans&#8208;cinnamylamines with 75&#8211;85&#8201;% regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity over other isomers. Optimisation of the Boc&#8208;deprotection step and its work&#8208;up procedure allowed for all minor isomers and impurities to be purged thus isolating pure trans&#8208;cinnamylamines typically in 55&#8211;65&#8201;% yield without need for chromatography. We have successfully performed this chemistry in up to 5&#8197;g scale and demonstrated its usefulness by applying it to the synthesis of abamine, naftifine hydrochloride and a formal synthesis reboxetine mesylate.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Promoted Minisci&#8211;Type Cyanoalkylation of Azauracils via C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;induced Minisci&#8211;type cyanoalkylation of azauracils and cyclobutanone oxime esters was developed under metal&#8208;free and base&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
A photo&#8208;induced Minisci&#8211;type cyanoalkylation of azauracils was developed under metal&#8208;free and base&#8208;free conditions. Readily available cyclobutanone oxime esters were used as the cyanoalkylating reagents via C&#8722;C bond cleavage to generate the &#947;&#8208;cyanoalkyl azauracil derivatives in good to moderate yields. The introduced cyano group can be easily converted into many other functional groups, thus makes current protocol more practical.

         <title>Selective Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Dimerization of Styrenes and Acrylates in Molten Tetrabutylammonium Acetate as an Ionic Liquid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective dimerization of styrenes and acrylates was possible with a very low amount of palladium acetate in molten tetrabutylammonium acetate. The coupling of substituted vinyl arenes gave exclusively the (E,E)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diarylbutadiene motif within 7&#8211;10 h, whereas butyl acrylate was converted into dibutyl 2&#8208;methyleneglutarate in less than 2 h. The catalytic pathways involved in the two processes were elucidated along with the role of the ionic liquid.







Abstract
A method for the selective dimerization of styrenes and acrylates has been developed. The reaction is catalyzed by a very low amount of palladium acetate in molten tetrabutylammonium acetate without the need for any additional ligand. The use of this method enabled the coupling of substituted vinyl arenes in reasonable yields to give exclusively the (E,E)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diarylbutadiene motif within 7&#8211;10 h. Acrylates, on the other hand, exhibit higher reactivity, and the use of dibutyl acrylate resulted in the quantitative synthesis of dibutyl 2&#8208;methyleneglutarate in less than 2 h. This selectivity is unprecedented in the literature. The role of the ionic liquid and the different catalytic pathways involved in the two processes were also elucidated.

         <title>Chiroptical Properties of a Cryptophane Soluble at Neutral pH</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article reports the synthesis of the two enantiomers of a water&#8208;soluble cryptophane 3 enabling cesium and thallium complexation at neutral or basic pH. The two enantiomers of 3 were obtained in a two steps synthesis from cryptophane 4, a molecule decorated with three phenol groups and three other phenol groups protected by benzyl units. The two enantiomers of 4 were isolated from liquid chromatography using chiral stationary phase. The absolute configuration of the two enantiomers of 3 was determined by vibrational circular dichroism combined with theoretical calculations. Contrary to cryptophane 1 that present large spectroscopic changes upon cesium and thallium complexation, the electronic circular dichroism spectra of compound 3 exhibit moderate spectral changes suggesting that this compound cannot change the conformation of its linkers as easily as cryptophane 1.</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Iodoazolium Salts: Searching for Cooperation Between Halogen Bonding and Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient synthetic route was designed to prepare bifunctional iodoazolium&#8208;based halogen bond (XB) donors bearing varied hydrogen bond (HB) donors. Even though physico&#8208;chemical studies did not show clear evidence for a cooperation between the two non&#8208;covalent interactions, the bifunctional ureido iodoazolium salt proved to be the best activating agent in a Ritter&#8208;type reaction.







Abstract
Non&#8208;covalent interactions play an important role in all sub&#8208;fields of chemistry, including catalysis, where interactions of different natures can work together to improve reactivitiy and selectivity. Several families of molecules that incorporate both hydrogen bond (HB) and halogen bonding (XB) donors have already been studied. However, there is a lack of data on how grafting HB donors to iodoazolium salts could impact their association and reactivity properties. Herein, we disclose the synthesis of a library of iodoazolium salts bearing varied HB donors, along with a study of their physico&#8208;chemical properties using different techniques (X&#8208;ray diffraction, 31P&#8197;NMR, ITC) and their behavior in catalysis. Even though no clear&#8208;cut evidence of cooperation between XB and HB could be obtained through physico&#8208;chemical evaluations, a iodoazolium salt bearing a urea function displayed better conversion and product selectivity in a Ritter reaction than all other activators lacking one or the other function.

         <title>cis&#8208;Linked Cyclotetraphenylenes: Synthesis, Structures and Fluorescence Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two cis&#8208;connected cyclic tetraphenylethylenes, [2]c&#8208;CTPE and [3]c&#8208;CTPE, were synthesized by platinum&#8208;mediated cyclization. The strain energy of [2]c&#8208;CTPE is up to 86.28&#8197;kJ&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1. [2]c&#8208;CTPE and [3]c&#8208;CTPE demonstrates typical Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) characteristics. Moreover, both [2]c&#8208;CTPE and [3]c&#8208;CTPE display mechanofluorochromic properties.







Abstract
cis&#8208;Linked cyclotetraphenylene dimer [2]c&#8208;CTPE and trimer [3]c&#8208;CTPE were synthesized via Pt&#8208;mediated cyclization of cis&#8208;diboronated tetraphenylethene. The structure of [2]c&#8208;CTPE has been confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The strain energy of [2]c&#8208;CTPE and [3]c&#8208;CTPE was calculated to be 86.28&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;kJ mol&#8722;1 and 9.23&#8197;kJ&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively. [2]c&#8208;CTPE and [3]c&#8208;CTPE are typical AIEgens and show mechanofluorochromic properties. The comparisons of cis&#8208;linked cyclotetraphenylenes with gem&#8208;linked cyclotetraphenylenes were also discussed.

         <title>Practical and Divergent Synthesis of Carbocyclic Pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine Nucleoside Analogues</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented base&#8208;build&#8208;up strategy has been applied for the synthesis of carbocyclic pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine nucleoside analogues. The analogues were synthesized at the very last stage to provide swift access to a concise set of compounds. A methoxy&#8208;substituted analogue displayed low micromolar activity against Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma rhodesiense.







Abstract
A concise set of 4&#8208;substituted pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine carboriboside analogues was synthesized in a divergent fashion via a central intermediate. An oxaziridine reagent allowed the synthesis of a crucial hydrazine glycon intermediate, which was transformed through a base&#8208;build&#8208;up strategy into the desired intermediate using a commercially available pyrimidine building block. Reaction with a variety of nucleophiles allowed late&#8208;stage diversification. All analogues were evaluated for activity against a representative panel of Trypanosomatida. A methoxy&#8208;substituted analogue displayed single&#8208;digit micromolar activity against two subspecies of Trypanosoma brucei in cellular assays.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;fluorocarbanions have garnered considerable attention for their dual reactivity in nucleophilic processes and &#946;&#8208;fluorine elimination. Herein, we reported a thorough computational analysis of the reactions between &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)styrenes and 2&#8208;pyridones to delineate the factors determining protonation or defluorination pathways for the in situ generated &#946;&#8208;fluorocarbanions under varied basic conditions. Our findings illuminate the critical role of organobase basicity in steering the direction of the competitive protonation and &#946;&#8208;fluorine elimination reactions. We propose the use of pKaH values of organobases as a quantitative indicator for discerning the predominant reaction pathways. This provides an efficient approach to predict the reaction outcome, facilitating the deliberate design of reactions to leverage the unique reactivity of &#946;&#8208;fluorocarbanions in the realm of fluorine chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Inorganic ligand&#8208;supported copper catalysts catalyzing alkyne coupling reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glaser&#8208;coupled synthesized 1,3&#8208;diyne can participate in the generation of conjugated polymers and is now widely used in organic and polymer synthesis. Currently, the catalysts in coupling are mostly based on the complexation of noble metals with complex organic ligands, which inevitably increases the research cost and storage difficulty. However, polymetallic oxides (POMs), with acidic and redox properties, can be used as excellent inorganic ligands with low cost and easy storage. In this work, we have synthesized copper catalysts 1, (NH4)4[CuMo6O18(OH)6] with polymetallic oxides as inorganic ligands in a facile way and applied them in the coupling of alkynes to obtain (non)symmetrical conjugated 1,3&#8208;diynes in high yields without bases, finally proposing a reasonable reaction path. In addition, the catalyst showed good tolerance to a variety of different groups, further demonstrating its excellent catalytic activity. It is worth mentioning that the catalyst maintained its good structure and activity after six cycles, demonstrating its promising potential for industrial applications. Thus, this paper provides a new strategy for the preparation of (un)symmetrical diynes using polymetallic oxides of Cu as catalysts, and also demonstrates the potential of multi&#8208;acid catalysts for organocatalytic applications.</dc:description>

Currently, the catalysts in coupling are mostly based on the complexation of noble metals with complex organic ligands, which inevitably increases the research cost and storage difficulty. However, polymetallic oxides (POMs), with acidic and redox properties, can be used as excellent inorganic ligands with low cost and easy storage. In this work, we have synthesized copper catalysts 1, (NH4)4[CuMo6O18(OH)6] with polymetallic oxides as inorganic ligands in a facile way and applied them in the coupling of alkynes to obtain (non)symmetrical conjugated 1,3-diynes in high yields without bases, finally proposing a reasonable reaction path. In addition, the catalyst showed good tolerance to a variety of different groups, further demonstrating its excellent catalytic activity. It is worth mentioning that the catalyst maintained its good structure and activity after six cycles, demonstrating its promising potential for industrial applications. Thus, this paper provides a new strategy for the preparation of (un)symmetrical diynes using polymetallic oxides of Cu as catalysts, and also demonstrates the potential of multi-acid catalysts for organocatalytic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over past few decades, synthetic chemists are working tirelessly for the development of environmentally benign and economically competent carbon&#8208;oxygen bond formation processes. Various oxidizing reagents and catalysts are being used to serve this purpose. Among all, t&#8208;butyl hydrogen peroxide (TBHP) has emerged as a greener and economically viable oxygen source, radical initiator and precursor of t&#8208;BuO&#8226; and t&#8208;BuOO&#8226; radicals. It has been extensively utilized as a reagent for the synthesis of epoxides, ketones, secondary alcohols, heterocyclic rings like benzofurans, isoquinoline and many more.

         <title>Dielectrophilic Approach to Sequential Heterofunctionalization of Ethylene from Vinylthianthrenium Salt</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinyl thianthrenium salt is a compound with interesting electrophilic properties capable of reacting with two distinct nucleophiles. By using&#160;b&#8208;keto esters as one of the reaction partners, it is possible to insert a chain of two carbon atoms with a further functionalization under mild conditions. We have studied this new methodology which involves the stepwise formation of a C&#8208;C and a C&#8208;X bond (with X = N, O, etc.) in one step without the use of metals. Depending on the reaction conditions and the starting ketoester, a varied reactivity has been observed and described.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of Cyclic Tertiary Alcohols with Lipase A from Candida antarctica</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme&#8208;catalyzed acylative kinetic resolution (KR) and dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic primary and secondary alcohols have been widely reported to produce esters with high enantiomeric purity. In contrast,&#160;similar KRs of tertiary alcohols have been reported for only a limited range of substrates and require prolonged reaction times of several days. To gain deeper insight into the substrate scope and increase the process efficiency, we examined the reaction conditions using commercially available immobilized lipase A from Candida antarctica and found that the addition of the heterogeneous, inorganic base sodium carbonate significantly increased the reaction rate while maintaining high enantioselectivity. The use of vinyl hexanoate as the acyl donor provided esters that were stable during chromatography purification. The optimized reaction conditions were then successfully applied to a range of cyclic tertiary alcohols containing tetralin, dihydroindene, chromane, and thiochromane skeletons having, in part, a substituent on the aromatic ring. In this study on the structure&#8211;reactivity relationship of enzymatic KR&#8208;type reactions, we achieved &gt;30% conversion for various tertiary alcohols in 24 h at 25 &#176;C, producing optically active esters with 88&#8211;99% ee.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of DNA&#8208;Conjugated Aryl Diazonium Intermediates in&#160;DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl diazonium intermediates have emerged as highly versatile intermediates in modern organic synthesis and chemical biology, demonstrating remarkable reactivity under mild reaction conditions. Their significance has extended to DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DELs), where they serve as valuable alternatives to traditional aryl halide&#8208;based cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Aryl diazonium intermediates as N2&#8208;annulation synthons can efficiently transform into benzotriazinone core on DNA besides C&#8211;C coupling. This concept paper illuminates recent advances in this field, emphasizing their applications and potential across various facets of DELs, off&#8208;DNA chemistry, DELs selection, and DNA&#8208;based probes. It is anticipated that these developments will propel the broader utilization of DNA&#8208;conjugated aryl diazonium salt intermediates in DELs, protein labeling, hit discovery, and other interdisciplinary fields.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Adenine diphosphate (ADP)&#8208;ribosylation catalyzed by bacterial toxins is the addition of an ADP&#8208;ribose moiety to specific amino acid residues in target proteins such as arginine, asparagine, glutamine, and histidine through 1,2&#8208;cis(&#945;)&#8208;glycosidic bond formation. ADP&#8208;ribosylation modifies host cell functions, altering normal cellular processes to facilitate their survival, and replication. Despite the development of click chemistry and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis&#8208;based approaches, the synthesis of structurally well&#8208;defined naturally occurring N&#8208;linked ADP&#8208;ribosyl molecules remains challenging. Herein, we report a direct and &#945;&#8208;selective N&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylation using unprotected &#946;&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosyl azide and triphenylphosphine esters through traceless Staudinger ligation. The stereoselectivity of this protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free N&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylation was validated by enzymatic degradation experiment and high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography, referencing synthetic standards. This method facilitated the facile and rapid synthesis of N&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosyl acetamide, biotin, fluorescent dye, amino acids, and tripeptide with complete &#945;&#8208;selectivity and moderate yields (37&#8211;55%).</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes are unique structural motifs with important applications ranging from drugs to materials. Herein, we report a novel radical&#8208;mediated defluorinative allylation of sulfamate esters&#160;with &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes through distal C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization under photoredox conditions. The reaction could readily incorporate various gem&#8208;difluoroalkene motifs into previously unfunctionalized sp3 carbon centers. The transformation allows directly dual activation of N&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds via a photocatalytic and redox&#8208;neutral process, as well as using water as environmentally friendly co&#8208;solvent. The reaction could provide a general and operationally simple method to access gem&#8208;difluoroalkene compounds with high diversity.</dc:description>

In this study, we explored the arylation of 3&#8208;methylene isoindolinones using aryl diazonium salts. The objective was to develop a method for accessing 3&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;methoxyisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones, a class of compounds with diverse biological activities and synthetic importance. Optimization of the reaction conditions revealed the significance of light irradiation for improved yields. The substrate scope investigation demonstrated the compatibility of various diazonium salts and N&#8208;substituents on the 3&#8208;methylene isoindolinone scaffold, yielding the corresponding methoxy lactams with high yields. Mechanistic insights were obtained by observing the effect of base and light irradiation. Two initiation mechanisms were proposed: in the presence of a base, the reaction could proceed even without light irradiation, while light irradiation was necessary in the absence of a base.

         <title>Advances in Enzymatic Incorporation of Small Fluorine Modules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organofluorine compounds find extensive application in the fields of agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, materials science, and molecular imaging. Introducing fluorine atoms can provide organic compounds with unique physicochemical properties or improve their biological activity. Although significant progress has been made in the chemical synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing compounds, achieving selective fluorination under mild conditions remains extremely challenging. Introducing biocatalytic approaches in organofluorine chemistry is an important strategy given their high efficiency, selectivity, and environmental friendliness. In this review, we present the discovery of fluorinated natural products and fluorinases, the crystal structure and the directed evolution of fluorinases, with a focus on recent advances in the enzymatic synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing compounds in recent years. It is hoped that this review will help to promote the field of biocatalytic organofluorine compound synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of a Planar&#8211;Chiral [2.2]Paracyclophane via Michael Addition to Nitroolefins Catalyzed by N&#8208;Terminal Guanidinylated Helical Peptide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;terminal guanidinylated resin&#8211;supported helical peptides were found to catalyze the kinetic resolution of a planarly chiral 4&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrovinyl)[2.2] paracyclophane via asymmetric Michael addition with an s&#8208;factor reaching up to 111.







Abstract
Kinetic resolution of 4&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrovinyl)[2.2]paracyclophane based on N&#8208;terminal&#8211;guanidinylated resin&#8211;bound helical peptide catalyzed asymmetric Michael addition of malonate esters was developed. This approach provides a new pathway to enantiopure paracyclophane derivatives characterized by both planar and central chirality, along with the recovery of the chiral substrate with a selectivity factor of up to 111. Additionally, the synthetic potential of the resulting products has been showcased through their successful transformation into derivatives of &#946;&#8208;substituted &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid.

         <dc:description>Heteroaryl 2&#8208;sulfonamides are an important structural moiety in drug discovery. However, reports of the efficient synthesis of these scaffolds are rare. Herein we disclose new reaction conditions to synthesize heteroaryl 2&#8208;sulfonamides from disulfanes and amines through an SN2&#8211;oxidation cascade. The approach is compatible with a wide variety of heteroaryl and amine substrates and can be conducted on a gram scale.

         <title>On the Substrate Scope of Dimethylsulfonium Propionate Lyases toward Dimethylsulfoxonium Propionate Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six DMSP lyases were investigated for their potential to cleave synthetic DMSOP analogs with longer alkyl chains into sulfoxides and acrylate. The pH dependency and enzyme kinetics of these reactions were determined, showing efficient transformation by four of the studied DMSP lyases.







Abstract
The six dimethylsulfonium propionate (DMSP) lyases DddQ, DddW, DddP, DddY, DddK and DddL catalyze the elimination of dimethyl sulfide from DMSP and can also cleave the marine metabolite dimethylsulfoxonium propionate (DMSOP) to DMSO and acrylate. In this study the potency of all six enzymes for the conversion of four DMSOP analogs with longer alkyl chains that were synthesized in three steps from 3&#8208;mercaptopropionic acid was investigated. For this purpose, the pH dependency of the enzyme reactions was determined, showing optimal conditions at pH&#8197;8 for all enzymes but DddP, for which an optimum of pH&#8197;6 was found. Efficient transformations were observed for DddQ, DddW, DddY and DddK, for which the Michaelis&#8208;Menten kinetics were determined for all four substrate analogs. HPLC analysis of the dialkylsulfoxides obtained with the most efficient enzyme DddW revealed that these compounds were obtained with a low to moderate enantiomeric excess (up to 25&#8201;% ee), demonstrating that this enzyme has a preference for one of the enantiomers of the DMSOP analogs.

         <title>Palladium Catalyzed Carbonyl Amination of Fluorinated Olefins for Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;Acrylamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an example of the carbonylation of fluorinated olefins to trifluoromethacrylamide catalyzed by palladium. By optimizing reaction conditions, we can obtain different amide compounds, including alkyl acrylamide. Aromatic acrylamide and heterocyclic acrylamide. This method has good substrate adaptability and functional group tolerance, and is expected to be used for the synthesis of key amides in fields such as medicine.







Abstract
Acrylamides are a class of important organic compounds that play key roles in biomedical chemistry, materials science, life science, and other fields. Due to the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of trifluoromethyl, the synthesis of trifluoromethylated acrylamides, especially those containing double bonds, has long been a challenge. Here, we report an example of the formation of trifluoromethyl acrylamides through palladium catalyzedcarbonylation of fluorinated olefins. By optimizing the reaction conditions, we can obtain different amide compounds, including alkyl acrylamides. aromatic acrylamides and heterocyclic acrylamides. This method has good substrate adaptability and functional group tolerance,so it is expected to be used in the synthesis of key amides in the fields of medicine and other fields.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The generation of thioesters through thioesterification of carboxylic acid has significant synthetic value given the easy availability of various carboxylic acids and the extensive application of thioesters. An economical and rapid thioester synthesis approach is still needed. Herein, we achieved thioesterification of carboxylic acids with valuable glycosyl thiol, aromatic and aliphatic&#160;thiols mediated by sulfonyl fluoride (SO2F2). The compatibility of numerous carboxylic acid substrates was tested, including (hetero)aromatic and aliphatic carboxylic acids and the reaction proceeded smoothly under mild conditions at good yields. Late&#8208;stage&#160;modification of drug molecules rac&#8208;Naproxen and Loxoprofen proved feasible. Besides, the gram&#8208;scale reaction demonstrated the utility of this protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Boron&#8208;Based Enantiomerism</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flat, tri&#8208;coordinate boron rears its had, becomes tetra&#8208;coordinate and chiral! When treated in an appropriate manner, it forms enantiomers that are configurationally stable. Only since recently, boron&#8208;stereogenic complexes are accessible by catalytic enantioselective syntheses. What makes this particularly exciting is that tetra&#8208;coordinate boron compounds are considered promising light&#8208;emitting materials.







Abstract
Boron&#8208;based enantiomerism is fragile due to the inherent tendency of a dissociation of a ligand from tetra&#8208;coordinate chiral boron complexes under formation of the achiral tri&#8208;coordinate species. This review will present the different approaches in overcoming the inherent tendency of racemization in boron&#8208;stereogenic compounds. When embedded in an environment of chiral ligands or substituents, configurationally stable boron stereogenic centers can form in a diastereoselective manner. Compounds incorporating boron as the exclusive stereogenic center are obtained by resolution of the racemic mixtures. The recently developed &#8211; much more efficient &#8211; methods of a catalytic, enantioselective creation of boron stereogenic compounds are highlighted in this review. Finally the chiroptical properties of enantiomerically pure boron complexes that makes them promising materials or devices are addressed.

         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of pyranicin and 4&#8208;epi&#8208;pyranicin has been accomplished from carbohydrate precursors. The general synthetic strategy includes two main fragment formations: (1) THP fragment (2) Butenolide fragment.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a simple and efficient pathway for the total synthesis of pyranicin and 4&#8208;epi&#8208;pyranicin by utilizing carbohydrates as chiral raw materials for the first time. The general synthetic strategy involves the formation of two main fragments: Fragment 1 is the central tetrahydropyran core, which was constructed in a total of 10 steps from 2,3,4,6&#8208;tetra&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl D&#8208;glucal via Ferrier&#8208;type rearrangement and oxidative cyclization as the key steps. Fragment 2 is the butenolide fragment, which was obtained in a gram scale with a total of 14 steps from diacetyl&#8208;L&#8208;rhamnal involving a ring contraction strategy.

         <title>Reactivity of Biomass&#8208;Derived Olefins with Elemental Sulfur: Mechanistic Insight</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of biomass&#8208;derived aryl olefins with elemental sulfur was studied at 180 and 230&#8201;&#176;C and at three different sulfur/organic substrate ratios. Products resulting from a range of mechanisms were unveiled, including inverse vulcanization, S&#8722;Callylic/benzylic bond formation, S&#8722;Caryl bond formation, intramolecular cyclization, C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bond scission, and C&#8722;O &#963;&#8208;bond scission.







Abstract
Lignocellulosic biomass remains underutilized despite its annual production in gigaton quantities. Sulfur is another vastly underutilized waste product of fossil fuel refining. New mechanistic insight into the reactions of sulfur unveiled since 2020 suggest a rich and hitherto unexplored chemistry between biomass&#8208;derived olefins and elemental sulfur. In this study, four biomass&#8208;derived olefins (eugenol (1), 4&#8208;allyl&#8208;2,6&#8208;dimethoxyphenol (2), o&#8208;eugenol (3), and 2&#8208;allyl&#8208;6&#8208;methylphenol (4)) were reacted with elemental sulfur to elucidate the S&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming and other reactivity of these compounds. Each of the compounds was reacted with elemental sulfur in three sulfur : organic reactant ratios (2&#8201;:&#8201;1, 4&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 9&#8201;:&#8201;1) and at two temperatures (180&#8201;&#176;C or 230&#8201;&#176;C). Product mixtures were characterized using 1H NMR spectrometry and GC&#8208;MS analysis. Products resulting from a range of mechanisms were unveiled, including inverse vulcanization, S&#8722;Callylic/benzylic bond formation, S&#8722;Caryl bond formation, intramolecular cyclization, C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bond scission, and C&#8722;O &#963;&#8208;bond scission. It is anticipated that the insights from this study will support further synergy between the critical sustainability goals of biomass and sulfur utilization.

In this study, four biomass-derived olefins (eugenol (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), 4-allyl-2,6-dimethoxyphenol (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-eugenol (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), and 2-allyl-6-methylphenol &lt;b&gt;(4)&lt;/b&gt;) were reacted with elemental sulfur to elucidate the S&#8722;C bond-forming and other reactivity of these compounds. Each of the compounds was reacted with elemental sulfur in three sulfur : organic reactant ratios (2&#8201;:&#8201;1, 4&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 9&#8201;:&#8201;1) and at two temperatures (180&#8201;&#176;C or 230&#8201;&#176;C). Product mixtures were characterized using &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectrometry and GC-MS analysis. Products resulting from a range of mechanisms were unveiled, including inverse vulcanization, S&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;allylic/benzylic&lt;/sub&gt; bond formation, S&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;aryl&lt;/sub&gt; bond formation, intramolecular cyclization, C&#8722;C &#963;-bond scission, and C&#8722;O &#963;-bond scission. It is anticipated that the insights from this study will support further synergy between the critical sustainability goals of biomass and sulfur utilization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoinduced Generation of Active Intermediates from Unmodified 1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds for Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reviews the advancements in the site&#8208;specific activation of unmodified 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds via photoinduction, focusing on two activation mechanisms. The first involves photoinduced redox reactions, activating the &#945;&#8208;position of the carbonyl group. The second occurs via absorption of photons in the enol form or energy transfer through a photocatalyst, leading to an excited&#8208;state transition and subsequent reactions such as 6&#960; cyclization or the de Mayo reaction.







Abstract
Photocatalysis utilizes light as the initial driving force for chemical reactions, enabling reactions with high energy barriers in traditionally thermal chemistry to proceed under mild conditions. 1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyl compounds occur as important active molecules in nature and are intermediates in pharmaceutical syntheses. In recent years, there have been numerous studies of these compounds, and it is common practice to pre&#8208;modify them before the reaction, which is, however, unfavorable for the atom economy of the process. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in the site&#8208;specific activation of unmodified 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds by photoinduction. The focus is on elucidating the mechanisms of these reactions to provide insights and directions for future research in designing novel reactions.

         <title>Exploitation of Mechanistic Product Selectivity for the Two&#8208;Step Synthesis of Optically Active Bio&#8208;Derived Cyclic Carbonates Incorporating Amino Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of cyclic carbonates bearing amino acid functionality is described. The use of enantiopure amino acids and glycidol, in the initial formation of the substrate, combined with the stereo&#8208;retentive mechanism of the cycloaddition with CO2 furnishes bio&#8208;derived cyclic carbonates which display a range of optical activities. A DFT study provides important insights into the operative mechanism.







Abstract
The synthesis of bio&#8208;derived cyclic carbonates is attracting a lot of attention as the incorporation of bio&#8208;derived functionality into these compounds provides the opportunity to prepare previously unknown structures, whilst also improving their sustainability profiles. This study presents a facile preparation of diastereomerically pure bio&#8208;derived cyclic carbonates displaying a range of optical rotation values. These compounds are obtained from glycidol, amino acids and CO2 in a facile two&#8208;step approach. Initially, the diastereomerically pure amino acid functionalised epoxides are prepared through a robust Steglich esterification of enantiopure glycidol (R or S) and an amino acid (D or L). Thereafter, in a second step, cycloaddition of the epoxide with CO2 results in the retention of the initial stereochemistry of the epoxide, furnishing novel diastereomerically pure and optically active cyclic carbonate products. A DFT study has explained the basis of this observed retention of configuration for these compounds. Further, results from this DFT study also provide new mechanistic information concerning a co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free cycloaddition reaction starting from glycidol when using the gallium&#8208;catalyst, which is found to operate through metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity.

         <title>Decarboxylative Amination of SMAHOs by Dialkyl Azodicarboxylates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organocatalyzed decarboxylative addition of substituted malonic acid half oxyesters (SMAHOs) to dialkyl azodicarboxylates led to the formation of &#945;&#8208;aminoester derivatives. The reaction can be performed under mild reaction conditions using 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) as a catalyst and displayed a rather important scope.







Abstract
The decarboxylative addition of substituted malonic acid half oxyesters (SMAHOs) to dialkyl azodicarboxylates is described. The reaction was promoted by 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) as an organocatalyst in heated toluene. High yields of the coupling products were generally obtained, and the scope of the reaction proved rather important with the potential presence of functionalized side chains at the &#945;&#8208;position, affording an original access to &#945;&#8208;aminoester derivatives.

         <title>Exploring the Reactivity of Melanins as Photocatalysts for Reductive Dehalogenations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four melanin polymers prepared from different precursors (5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole, 5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole 2&#8208;carboxylic acid, 1,8&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene and dopamine) have been adopted as photocatalysts in the reductive dehalogenation of a series of model a&#8208;halogen carbonyl derivatives. The best performing melanin was that obtained from 5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole 2&#8208;carboxylic acid, which allowed to dehalogenate efficiently both bromomalonate esters and phenacyl bromide; on the other hand, chloromalonate esters were almost unreactive under the same reaction conditions. Electrochemical and control experiments enabled to elucidate the reaction mechanism, demonstrating the key role of electrons as charge carriers in the observed photocatalytic process.</dc:description>

         <title>Commercial transaminases for the asymmetric synthesis of bulky amines.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transaminase&#8208;catalysed asymmetric amination is a valuable transformation for the synthesis of chiral amines. However, its use in synthetic chemistry has been curtailed by a narrow substrate scope and limited information on commercially available catalysts. In this work we have explored the substrate scope of selected commercially available transaminases, focusing on prochiral ketones bearing two bulky substituents and their application in both enzyme&#8208;catalysed and enzyme&#8208;triggered reactions. (R)&#8208; and/or (S)&#8208;selective enzymes converted methyl&#8208;, isopropyl&#8208;,&#160;n&#8208;butyl&#8208;, and cyclohexyl&#8208;phenone substrates to the corresponding amines in the range of 6 &#8208; &gt;99% ee. In some cases, a stereochemical switch was detected, in which (R)&#8208;enantioselectivity was observed with enzymes typically assigned as (S)&#8208;selective. Upscaling of selected biotransformations provided chiral amines, in &gt;99% ee and up to 40% isolated yield. Furthermore, transaminase&#8208;triggered reactions, which were previously limited to methyl&#8208; and ethyl&#8208;derivatives, were expanded to phenyl&#8208;derivatives for the formation of a&#160;cis&#8208;2,6&#8208;disubstituted piperidine and 2,4&#8208;diphenyl pyrroline, and isolated in up to 67% yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane&#8208;Containing Aromatic Lipoxin B4

Analogue and Heteroaromatic Congeners</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipoxins are pro&#8208;resolving mediators that play an important role in the resolution phase of the innate inflammatory response. However, because of their chemical and metabolic instability, the design of more stable synthetic analogues of lipoxin A4 and lipoxin B4 is an ongoing area of study.&#160; Herein we report the asymmetric synthesis of an aromatic lipoxin B4 analogue containing a conformationally rigid and potentially more metabolically resistant bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) ring incorporated into the upper alkyl chain. This was achieved by the development of a 9&#8208;step chiral&#8208;pool synthesis of a novel BCP&#8208;containing boronic ester coupling partner which could serve as a common precursor to the target analogue as well as other analogues with further modifications to the aromatic core.</dc:description>

         <title>A ChemoEnzymatic Approach for the Preparation of &#8220;Linear&#8208;Shaped&#8221; Diaryl Pyrazines as Potential Antiprotozoal Agents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogenous heterocyclic rings are present in a wide range of drugs, natural compounds, and&#160;fine chemicals and are considered privileged scaffolds in medicinal chemistry. Seeking novel antiprotozoal drugs acting on new targets or by&#160;novel mechanisms of action, we focused on a preliminary evaluation of the potential&#160;of &#8220;linear&#8208;shaped&#8221; diaryl pyrazines. To this purpose, a two&#8208;enzyme&#160;chemoenzymatic synthesis of this heteroaromatic core was proposed. Specifically, starting from simple, commercially available aromatic aldehydes,&#160;the target pyrazines were obtained through a sequence of biocatalytic benzoin condensation, chemical oxidation, and a transaminase&#8208;mediated tandem process of transamination and cyclization. The profiles of the compounds&#160;as antiprotozoal agents were evaluated in vitro against cultures of&#160;Leishmania&#160;and&#160;Plasmodium&#160;and using the human cell line HepG2.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Radical Borylation of Alkyl Chlorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under 400&#8197;nm visible light irradiation, primary and secondary alkyl chlorides can be activated in the presence of bis(neopentyl glycolato)diboron and an tert&#8208;butoxide to form alkyl radicals, which then react with diboron(4) compounds to afford alkylboronic esters. This protocol is a catalyst&#8208;free and practical approach to valuable alkylboronic ester intermediates.







Abstract
The traditional method for the preparation of alkylboronic esters involves transition metal catalysis or transition metal&#8208;free methods relying on single electron transfer. Each method relies on the suitable choice of catalyst or electron transfer mediator. In this study, we have developed a new method for the synthesis of alkylboronic esters from alkyl chlorides and diboron(4) compounds, without the need for additional metal or non&#8208;metal catalysts. We discovered that under 400&#8197;nm visible light irradiation, alkyl chlorides can be activated in the presence of bis(neopentyl glycolato)diboron and an alkoxide base to form alkyl radical intermediates, which then react with diboron(4) compounds, resulting in high yields of alkylboronic esters. The reaction is applicable to both primary and secondary alkyl chlorides. The simplicity of operation and the broad substrate scope of this method make it practical for the synthesis of valuable alkylboronic ester intermediates.

We have developed a one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component strategy for the Friedel&#8208;Crafts arylation of &#945;&#8208;imino ketones with imidazopyridines under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. The reaction did not require any inert conditions and proceeded at room temperature in the open flask.







Abstract
We report here a catalyst&#8208;free, (sp2)C&#8722;H imination reaction of in&#8208;situ formed imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines and &#945;&#8208;iminoketones. This one&#8208;pot, multicomponent, and atom economic reaction is performed at moderate to room temperature without the need for any catalyst and inert conditions. The reaction showed good substrate tolerance with appreciable yields. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and post&#8208;synthetic modifications to obtain 1,2&#8208;diketones are also described.

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Catenanes Platformed with meso&#8208;Arylporphyrin</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Padlock&#8221; structures comprising cyclodextrin (CD) catenanes were successfully constructed using a strong intermolecular interaction of CD with meso&#8208;arylporphyrin in water. A water soluble Grubbs's catalyst was used for interlocking CD onto the porphyrin. The novel catenane compounds were useful to elucidate the highly specific intermolecular interactions of methylated CD to meso&#8208;(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl)porphyrins in water.







Abstract
Among mechanically interlocked supramolecular systems with cyclodextrins (CDs), successful examples of CD&#8208;based catenanes are limited compared to a number of CD rotaxanes owing to the synthetic difficulties. We herein demonstrate an efficient synthesis of a CD&#8208;based catenane using a meso&#8208;arylporphyrin (Por) platform. Using Por modified with two olefin&#8208;terminated oxyethylene chains at the cis&#8208;meso&#8208;positions, an interlocked Por&#8208;CD catenane was synthesized via olefin metathesis in the presence of per&#8208;O&#8208;methylated &#946;&#8208;CD (TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD) in water. The novel Por&#8208;CD catenane was obtained in 30&#8201;% isolated yield, which was characterized by MALDI&#8208;TOF mass and NMR spectroscopies. In the latter part, we demonstrate determination of the binding constants between TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD and meso&#8208;(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin using Por&#8208;CD catenane, 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD (DMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD), and 13C&#8208;labeled TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD (13C&#8208;TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD). The host&#8208;guest exchange reaction from the Por&#8208;CD catenane/DMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD to the Por&#8208;CD catenane/TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD complexes was directly monitored through 1D HMQC spectroscopy. The ratio of these complexes revealed the difference in the binding affinities of DMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD and TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD to Por. The stable 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 inclusion complex between meso&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin (TPPS) and TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD has been well&#8208;studied for many years. This study is the first to determine the respective binding constants, K1 and K2, using the model system, to be 3.0&#215;107&#8197;M&#8722;1 and 3.4&#215;107&#8197;M&#8722;1, respectively.

         <title>Direct Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction of Biomass&#8208;Derived Furfurol with Maleimides in a Bio&#8208;Based Green Solvent</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The upconversion of biomass&#8208;derived furfurol through a direct Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with maleimides in 2&#8208;Me&#8208;THF enabled the construction of various heterocyclic compounds, while switching the reaction selectivity depending on the temperature.







Abstract
Environmental concern has motivated an inclination to exploit waste and upgrade it into high&#8208;added&#8208;value chemicals. Biomass is an excellent carbon source that provides a variety of raw materials as building blocks, such as furans. Herein, we report the upcycling of furfurol, a known biomass by&#8208;product, through a Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition with maleimides that is performed in a green bio&#8208;derived solvent, 2&#8208;MeTHF. We provide two alternative sets of reaction conditions to promote exo or endo selectivity, which depends on the temperature employed. A variety of products were obtained in 70&#8211;96&#8201;% yield and high exo selectivity at 80&#8201;&#176;C, while a 30&#8201;:&#8201;70&#8208;45&#8201;:&#8201;55 exo/endo ratio was produced at room temperature. A large&#8208;scale reaction was also performed.

         <dc:description>
The successful realization of direct palladium&#8208;catalyzed C8&#8208;fluoroalkylation and C8&#8208;fluoroalkenylation of naphthalene derivatives has been accomplished, employing iodonium salts as coupling partners. The reactions exhibited complete C8&#8208;regioselectivity, and diverse carbonyl groups were identified as effective directing groups.







Abstract
In this study, two novel C8&#8208;functionalization methods of 1&#8208;carbonylnaphthalenes were developed. Leveraging iodonium triflates as coupling partners, we disclose palladium&#8208;catalyzed C8&#8208;fluoroalkylation and C8&#8208;fluoroalkenylation processes. These protocols exhibit broad applicability across diverse naphthalene derivatives, owing to carbonyl directing groups at the C1 position which can be retained for subsequent applications or selectively removed, enhancing the versatility of the developed methodologies.

         <title>Selective Synthesis of Functionalized 3(2H)&#8208;Furanones via Tandem Michael
Addition/Rearrangement/Cyclization Reaction of Aliphatic Alkynones: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel catalyst&#8208; and solvent&#8208;controlled dimerization of aliphatic alkynones through tandem Michael addition/rearrangement/cyclization sequence has been developed. The elaborated protocol provides a convenient chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective access to rare 3(2H)&#8208;furanones decorated with 2&#8208;exo&#8208;methylene and 4&#8208;ethenyl functionalities. A comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) study of possible reaction mechanism including ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis of various substrate/catalyst/solvent complexes has revealed the Janus&#8208;like behavior of the employed sodium tert&#8208;butoxide/toluene system that is responsible both for the chemoselectivity of the initial addition step and the inhibition of the final cyclization step.</dc:description>

         <title>A Practical, Scalable Synthesis of 1,18&#8208;Octadecanedioic acid&#8208;Paclitaxel (ODDA&#8208;PTX)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,18&#8208;Octadecanedioic acid&#8208;paclitaxel (ODDA&#8208;PTX) emerged as a promising paclitaxel prodrug, thanks to its high efficacy and low toxicity. A novel strategy for its synthesis has been developed. It affords the product with high purity and can be practically scaled&#8208;up for the industrial production of ODDA&#8208;PTX.







Abstract
Paclitaxel is one of the most important chemotherapy agents and it has shown activity against a variety of human cancers. In the past years several derivatives and formulations have been developed to improve its activity and reduce its toxicity. Recently, 1,18&#8208;Octadecanedioic acid&#8208;Paclitaxel (ODDA&#8208;PTX), obtained by conjugation of paclitaxel with a long&#8208;chain diacid, has emerged as a promising paclitaxel prodrug, with high efficacy and low toxicity. A novel strategy for its synthesis has been developed and is herein described. The approach is based on the mono&#8208;allyl protection of octadecanedioic acid (ODDA) and on the Pd&#8208;catalyzed removal of the allyl ester after coupling with paclitaxel. This strategy is superior to previously reported procedures in that it affords the ODDA&#8208;PTX product with much higher purity, avoids chromatographic purifications and can be practically scaled&#8208;up for the industrial production of ODDA&#8208;PTX.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Chiral Allenes via Asymmetric 1,4&#8208;Difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;Enynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allenes represent a distinctive class of organic molecules characterized by their unique physical and chemical properties. Among them, chiral allenes play a significant role in modern chemistry. They not only serve as pivotal frameworks for natural products and drug molecules but also are essential building blocks in organic synthesis. Over the years, numerous remarkable and efficient methods have been developed for the synthesis of chiral allenes. Notably, the catalytic synthesis of chiral allenes using transition metals in conjunction with chiral ligands has garnered considerable attention. This review paper aims to provide an overview of recent advancements in the synthesis of chiral allenes through asymmetric 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;enynes, in which two distinct strategies including non&#8208;radical and radical processes are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyhalogenated Carbohydrates: Synthesis and Applications of Sugar Halides from Fluorine to Iodine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The societal importance of sucralose (a trichlorinated disaccharide) doesn't fade over time. This review focuses on the synthesis and applications of polyhalogenated carbohydrates incorporating fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine atoms. An overview of the current state of the art of sugar inter&#8208;halides is also presented.







Abstract
Polyfluorinated carbohydrates have attracted attention in the last decades. This is due to the interesting properties of such organofluorines. What about the other halogens? Since the discovery of sucralose (a trichlorinated disaccharide) more than 50&#8197;years ago, only a handful of chlorinated, brominated, or iodinated carbohydrates have been reported. This review focuses on the synthesis of polyhalogenated carbohydrates, including sugar inter&#8208;halides, but excluding polyfluorinated sugars. An overview of the current state of the art of their potential application is also described.

         <title>Double winding vine&#8208;shaped biphenyl with molecular asymmetry. Synthesis, structure, and properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A biphenyl derivative in which two benzene rings are strapped with two chains is prepared. The synthesized product shows molecular asymmetry, which was confirmed by HPLC analysis with chiral column and named as winding vine&#8208;shaped biphenyl. The synthesis of such vine shaped molecule was performed by ring&#8208;closing metathesis or alternatively by annulation with nosylated ethylenediamine. The structure of the obtained product was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The absolute configuration of the molecular asymmetry was assigned after leading to the corresponding camphor sulfonamide through denosylation and re&#8208;amidation process.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halogen bond has received widespread attention in recent years due to the vast applications in supramolecular chemistry, sensing and crystal engineering. In contrast to the normal halogen bonds, [N&#8211;I&#8211;N] type halogen bond exhibits enhanced strength and solvent resistance capabilities. It adopts a bonding geometry of the three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron bond, where the nitrogen can be a neutral, positive, or negative species such as pyridine, saccharin, and urotropine moieties. The emerging new type halogen bond has found specific potentials in constructing supramolecular architectures and catalysis. This concept provides a brief summary based on recent developments of [N&#8211;I&#8211;N] type halogen bonding, reviewing and summarizing its synthesis, structure and application.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Networking&#8208;Guided Discovery of Kyonggic Acids in Massilia spp.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, bacteria of the genus Massilia have been identified as promising sources of bioactive natural products. In this study, we used mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based molecular networking for the first comprehensive analysis of the secondary metabolome of these microorganisms. Annotation of the detected metabolite clusters with a mass fragmentation database revealed several compounds not previously known to be produced by Massilia species. To secure sufficient material for further structural analyses as well as biological testing, we selected the most promising producer strains from our molecular networking analysis and subjected them to larger&#8208;scale cultivation. Following extraction and UV&#8208;directed isolation, we obtained five metabolites in milligram quantities. In addition to a cyclic dipeptide, we elucidated the structures of four acyl amino acids that are related to thalassotalic acid C from the marine bacterium Thalassotalea sp. The Massilia&#8208;derived kyonggic acids were found to inhibit the enzyme tyrosinase, which is involved in melanin biosynthesis influencing skin and hair pigmentation. This study illustrates the value of combining spectroscopic and computational tools in natural product discovery in order to detect and guide the isolation of previously overlooked bioactive compounds.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Nitroglycals are important synthons for biological active 2&#8208;aminoglycosides, glycoconjugates and natural products synthesis. Herein, we summarized the recent advance of 2&#8208;nitroglycals from 2014 to 2023. A plethora of applications on the synthesis of bioactive compounds via Michael&#8211;type addition, sugar ring opening reaction, Ferrier rearrangement were summarized. Organo&#8211;catalysis glycosylation plays a pivotal role in these applications.







Abstract
2&#8208;Nitroglycals are important synthons for biological active 2&#8208;aminoglycosides, glycoconjugates and natural products synthesis. Herein, we summarized the recent advances of 2&#8208;nitroglycals including its synthetic methods and its applications. Using 2&#8208;nitroglycals, 2&#8208;aminoglycosides, nitro&#8208;polyol derivatives, sugar&#8208;furan derivatives, sugar&#8208;pyrrole molecules, 2,3&#8208;diaminoglycosides and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;dithioglycosides were obtained via Michael&#8211;type addition, retro&#8208;Henry&#8208;type reaction, C1/C3&#8208;Ferrier rearrangement and [3+2] N&#8208;heterocyclic addition. Most of these conversions are achieved via mild organo&#8208;catalysis glycosylation methods.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Induced Trifluoromethylation/Cyclization of Unactivated Alkene&#8208;Bound Quinazolinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we reported a selective, mild method for the visible light&#8208;photocatalyzed trifluoromethylation and cyclization of unactivated tethered alkenes to provide tri&#8208; and tetracyclic quinazolinones. Trifluoroacetic acid and anhydride are inexpensive and readily available reagents for the process which proceeds without the addition of a strong oxidant. Broad substrate scope and the formation of 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered rings are demonstrated in 44&#8208;82% yields. Control experiments provide the basis for a proposed mechanism involving photocatalyzed SET from fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 to TFAA, and trifluoromethyl radical&#8208;mediated regioselective cyclization. The practicality of the protocol was illustrated by a gram&#8208;scale synthesis in 76% yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 Compound&#8208;Activated DMSO: An Efficient Oxidizing Reagent to Convert Alcohols to Ketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study high&#8208;valent Cu(III) trifluoromethyl compounds in combination with DMSO is shown to be an efficient and mild oxidizing system for the conversion of alcohols to ketones (aldehydes as well). Trifluoromethoxylated sulfonium species is proposed to be initially formed that engages in crucial steps of alkoxy replacement at sulfonium center and deprotonative collapse of the resulting alkoxysulfonium intermediate in the presence of a base. This reaction is highly selective without over&#8208;oxidation, and can tolerate a broad range of functional groups owing to mild oxidizing ability of the Cu(III)&#8208;CF3/DMSO system and the inert N2 conditions. This method can be applied to the synthesis and functionalization of commercial drug compounds. This study illustrates an unusual reactivity property of high&#8208;valent Cu(III) trifluoromethyl compounds beyond the conventional CF3 group transfer reactivity, and opens up new opportunities for developing novel reactions of Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 compounds. The combined use of high&#8208;valent Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 compound and DMSO is anticipated to find more applications to develop other novel and useful oxidation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Promoted Desulfurative Cleavage of Cyclopropylmethyl Thioethers and Amination of the Formed Cyclopropylcarbinyl Cations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopropylmethyl sulfides react with N&#8208;fluorosulfonimide (NFSI) or molecular iodine, enabling C&#8211;S cleavage to generate cyclopropylcarbinyl cations, which evolve through cyclopropane ring&#8208;opening reactions into homoallyl cations suitable to react with nucleophiles present in the reaction media. This desulfurative cleavage of cyclopropylmethyl thioethers under non&#8208;acidic conditions facilitates homoallylation of N&#8208;based nucleophiles such as alkyl or aryl amines as well as sulfonimides through a one&#8208;pot protocol in one or two steps depending on the nucleophile. The reaction is initiated by a halogen&#8208;sulfur bond that causes C&#8211;S bond cleavage. Moreover, the reaction with iodine proceeds through homoallyl iodide intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Trifluoromethylative Difunctionalization of Styrenes and Phenylacetylenes via a Catalytic EDA Platform</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced trifluoromethylative difunctionalization of styrenes and phenylacetylenes using trifluoromethyl thianthrenium triflate (TT&#8208;CF3+OTf&#8722;). The transformation was enabled by the discovery of a photoactive catalytic EDA complex formed between carbazolyl dithiocarbamate and TT&#8208;CF3+OTf&#8722;. This three&#8208;component reactivity platform establishes a new paradigm for TT&#8208;CF3+OTf&#8722;, significantly expanding its repertoire of photochemically enabled trifluoromethylation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Urea&#8208;, Thiourea&#8208;, and Isothiourea&#8208;Based Bifunctional Tetraarylphosphonium Salt Catalysis for Conversion of Carbon Dioxide to Cyclic Carbonates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the development of bifunctional organocatalysts for the reaction of epoxides with atmospheric pressure of carbon dioxide. Isothiourea, thiourea, and urea groups are effective hydrogen bond donors for the carbon dioxide fixation. Computational mechanistic studies disclosed key hydrogen bond interactions between catalysts and intermediates, which relied upon orientation of the binding modes.







Abstract
A novel bifunctional isothiourea derived from a tetraarylphosphonium salt catalyzes the coupling reaction of monosubstituted epoxides with 1&#8197;atm of carbon dioxide to afford five&#8208;membered cyclic carbonates in high yields. Thiourea and urea groups are also effective hydrogen bond donors for the carbon dioxide fixation. Comprehensive mechanistic studies on this catalysis using theoretical calculations disclosed key hydrogen bond interactions between catalysts and intermediates, which relied upon orientation of the binding modes.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>the integration of photovoltaic technologies within agricultural settings, also known as agrivoltaic, is attracting increasing attention as a sustainable approach to ensure both clean energy and food supply. The success of this strategy relies on the development of innovative materials that can selectively convert specific wavelengths into energy while being transparent to photosynthetically relevant light. To this aim, here we report our endeavors in the synthesis of a new class of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D quinoxaline fluorophores and their use in the preparation of wavelength&#8208;selective luminescent solar concentrators (LSC). The dyes were expeditiously prepared following a direct arylation protocol and extensively characterized by spectroscopic analyses and computational studies. They present high light harvesting ability in the green region of the visible spectrum and good emission properties, which were fully retained in the solid state when embedded into a PMMA matrix. These materials were employed to construct LSC devices of promising efficiency, fostering further developments for the use of wavelength&#8208;selective LSC in agrivoltaic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Effects of a Larger N&#8208;Heterocyclic Ring in Rofecoxib Analogues on AIE Activity and Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two analogues of rofecoxib, 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF and 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF, were designed according to the strategy of heterocyclic ring enlargement and facilely synthesized in a facile manner by Knoevenagel reactions. The first compound, 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF, had low quantum yields (QY) of 3.0% in the solid states. After replacing the pyrrolidinyl with piperidinyl, the resulting 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF had a significantly increased QY, with a value of 28%. The root&#8208;mean&#8208;square deviation (RMSD) values between S0 and S1 of 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF and 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF in tetrahydrofuran were 0.51, 0.35 &#197;, respectively. As compared with 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF, compound 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF exhibits a smaller RMSD, which indicates a lower non&#8208;radiative transition rate. A single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study and Hirshfeld surfaces analysis revealed that 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF had a more nonplanar molecule structure and a weaker &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction, which might result in a higher fluorescence intensity and QY. Owing to its better aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior, compound 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF showed more multi&#8208;functional applications, including mechanochromism, acidochromism, and lipid droplets imaging ability. These results imply that the strategy of heterocyclic ring enlargement provides a new paradigm for the design of new luminogens with AIE properties.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have encountered a superbase&#8208;mediated chemoselective reaction of N&#8208;tosylhydrazones with aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide precursors. When tosylhydrazone was treated with ortho&#8208;aminobenzyl alcohol in super basic conditions (KOH+DMSO), we observed the formation of&#160; &#160;2&#8208;substituted quinoline. The reaction was found to be general, and by this method, mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted quinolines could be made. We could prove experimentally and theoretically that the reaction proceeded via the formation of&#160;an azine from the basic decomposition of N&#8208;tosylhydrazones.

Abstract
Diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of some novel functionalized azaheterocyclic &#946;&#8208;amino esters with multiple chiral centers from 1,3&#8208;cyclooctadiene&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;amino acids through a stereocontrolled synthetic route has been accomplished. The strategy was based on the creation of some novel unsaturated N&#8208;protected cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino esters from 1,3&#8208;cyclooctadiene. Products were subjected to ring&#8208;opening metathesis (ROM) followed by selective ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM). A comparative investigation on the selectivity, regarding the catalysts, yields, conversions, and substrate directing effect on ring&#8208;rearrangement metathesis (RRM) transformation has been accomplished. Importantly, the procedure used in this synthetic process does not affect the configuration of the chiral centers. The pathway takes place across conservation of the configurations of the stereocenters; therefore, the architectural skeleton of the starting cyclooctene&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;amino acids predetermined the structure of the new azaheterocyclic systems.

         <title>Nitrile Furanics via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydration of Aldoximes and Knoevenagel Condensation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrile furanic compounds have been prepared employing two simple synthetic approaches; i) dehydration of aldoximes and ii) Knoevenagel condensation. Both methodologies were firstly tested and optimized on furfural and thus exploited on 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furfural (HMF) and 5,5&#8217;&#8208;oxy(bismethylene)&#8208;2&#8208;furaldehyde (OBMF). All the resulting products were achieved in good to excellent yield and isolated as pure employing simple purification procedure.







Abstract
In this work two synthetic approaches to introduce nitrile moieties into bio&#8208;based derived furanic compounds were investigated, i.&#8201;e., dehydration of aldoximes and Knoevenagel condensation. Both methodologies have been first tested and optimized on furfural and thus exploited on 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furfural (HMF) and 5,5&#8217;&#8208;oxy(bismethylene)&#8208;2&#8208;furaldehyde (OBMF). The syntheses of furfural, HMF and OBMF aldoximes were efficiently conducted (also in large scale) under mild reaction conditions and short reaction time. The subsequent dehydration to nitrile furanic compounds was carried out in the presence of catalytic amount of copper acetate monohydrate. Furthermore, Knoevenagel condensations were performed on furfural, HMF and OBMF with different Activated Methylene Group compounds, using for the first&#8208;time dimethyl carbonate as the reaction media. Most of the resulting products were isolated as pure via simple liquid&#8208;liquid extraction in good to excellent yields. Future applications of these compounds might include aldoxime reduction into amine furanics &#8208; herein also preliminary investigated &#8208; and hydrolysis of the nitrile derivatives in the related carboxylic acid (or ester) furanics. All these products are interesting monomers for the preparation of bio&#8208;based polymers.

Abstract
The treatment of diethyl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydroaminophosphonate&#8197;1 with various arenes (ArH=toluene 2&#8201;a, benzene 2&#8201;b, anisole 2&#8201;c, bromobenzene 2&#8201;d, chlorobenzene 2&#8201;e, benzyl alcohol 2&#8201;f, p&#8208;xylene 2&#8201;g) in acetic acid (AcOH) at 120&#8201;&#176;C for 8&#8197;h in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 (10&#8201;%&#8201;mol, OAc=acetate) and AgOAc (3.4&#8197;equivalents) results in the formation of the corresponding &#946;&#8208;aryl derivatives E&#8208;Ar(H)C=C(NHAc)P(O)(OEt)2 3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;g. The reaction proceeds through double C&#8722;H activation (arene and alkene) and subsequent C&#8722;C oxidative coupling (Fujiwara&#8211;Moritani reaction), processes catalyzed by Pd and assisted by Ag. The obtained products 3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;g are isosteric analogs of phenylalanine and are obtained with high selectivity. Thus, geometrical E&#8208;isomers have been obtained in all studied cases, however mixtures of ortho&#8208;/meta&#8208;/para&#8208;isomers are observed when the activated position in the starting arene 2 is considered.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Synthesis Applied to Optoelectronic and Energy Materials: Design, Applications and Limitations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic Covalent Chemistry, consisting in the use of dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) to create complex objects by working at the thermodynamic equilibrium, has undeniable advantages for the preparation of conjugated systems with tailored optoelectronic properties for organic electronics. Chemists can combine simple building blocks with simple functional groups of appropriate geometry, structure and stoichiometry to build multidimensional conjugated architectures. Dynamic covalent reactions are often precious metal&#8208;free, generate little to no side products and are very efficient. DCBs however afford sensitive materials, and consequently a balance needs to be found between the ease of synthesis, the stability and the performances. The dynamicity of the target materials hence can considerably reduce their applicability in organic electronics where strongly stable materials are needed, but opens the door to stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviour and recyclability. A way to overcome dynamicity issues is to lock DCBs, but often at the cost of decreased conjugation. In this review, we will highlight how DCBs are employed to prepare functional optoelectronically active materials, such as discrete molecules, polymers or covalent organic frameworks, applied in fields ranging from organic light&#8208;emitting diodes and solar cells to organic batteries and transistors. We will also discuss their limitations, benefits and&#160; current challenges to overcome.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the efficient, sustainable one&#8208;pot synthesis of a wide variety of N&#8208;polyheterocycles, such as imidazo&#8208;quinolines and quinoxalines, and furoquinolines, from easily available nitroaromatics and glycols via a molybdenum catalytic domino reduction&#8208;imine formation&#8208;intramolecular cyclization&#8208;oxidation sequence. It is worth highlighting that the recycling and incorporation of the waste carbonyl byproduct, generated in the reduction step, into the final compound is realized. In addition, the overall efficiency and atom economy of the process are further improved owing to the participation of one reaction intermediate as reductant that allows lowering the amount of external reducing agent employed.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;Regulated Synthesis of the Bestmann&#8208;Ohira or Seyferth&#8208;Gilbert Reagent Utilizing FSO2N3</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a new application of fluorosulfonylazide (FSO2N3) for diazotizing a series of activated methylene compounds to deliver the corresponding diazo products. Notably, by the judicious choice of bases, the selective generation of the Bestmann&#8208;Ohira reagent (BOR) or the Seyferth&#8722;Gilbert reagent (SGR) has been realized from FSO2N3 and dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxopropylphosphonate. We also investigated the kinetics of the homologation of aldehydes using these two reagents with K2CO3 as a base in MeOH, finding that a faster reaction rate was achieved by using SGR. Moreover, the facile one&#8208;pot synthesis of terminal alkynes from aldehydes has been established, which could be further coupled with azides to deliver triazoles using CuAAC click chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzocoumarin&#8208;Fused Triskelions Exhibit AIEE Due to Inhibited Molecular Inversion</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triskelion&#8208;shaped AIEgens consisting of benzo[f], [g], and [h]coumarin units (2F, 2G, and 2H) were successfully synthesized through the intramolecular Ullmann coupling. These compounds adopt unique &#960;&#8208;twisted helical geometries because of the fusion mode of the benzocoumarins, and the structural isomers have different molecular thicknesses and planarities. These compounds demonstrate remarkable AIEE behaviour in the aggregated states because molecular inversion is suppressed.







Abstract
Developing aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) is a unique strategy for alleviating concentration quenching of &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic compounds. This AIE behaviour can be induced not only in organic dyes with rotors but also in invertible &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. Herein, intramolecular Ullmann coupling was used to synthesize &#960;&#8208;twisted triskelion&#8208;shaped AIEgens (2F, 2G, and 2H), in which benzo[f], [g], and [h] coumarins were fused into the benzene core to form a helical propeller shape. These structural isomers had unique molecular thicknesses and planarities depending on the fusion mode of the benzocoumarin. The racemic crystals, PPP and MMM, had different overlapping molecular configurations because of their twisted molecular frameworks. Compounds&#8197;2F, 2G and 2H demonstrated weak fluorescence emission in diluted solutions resulting from molecular motions caused by the isomerization process during molecular inversion. By comparison, aggregates exhibited enhanced emission intensity. These &#960;&#8208;twisted triskelions exhibited the characteristics of AIEgens.

         <dc:description>The formyl C&#8208;H thiolation of aldehydes using thiosulfonates using the decatungstate anion as a photocatalyst is reported. Using this photocatalytic protocol, both aromatic and aliphatic thioesters can be synthesized in good yields. The transformation consists of a cascade of double SH2 reactions, HAT and an ArS group transfer, and the yields are improved when the reaction is carried out in a CO atmosphere, which serves to limit the extent of decarbonylation acyl radicals that are generated in the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Simple and Efficient Method for Mono&#8208; and Di&#8208;Amination of Polypyridine N&#8208;Oxides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical and convenient one&#8211;pot procedure for reductive ortho&#8211;amination of pyridyl N&#8208;oxides is described, using potassium phthalimide and tosyl chloride followed by hydrolysis. The scope and applicability of the reaction was demonstrated, providing various mono&#8208; and di&#8208;aminated products in moderate to excellent yields.







Abstract
Herein we report a simple synthetic route towards both known and novel aminated polypyridyl ligands. The use of tosyl chloride in combination with potassium phthalimide followed by hydrolysis allows for chemo&#8211;selective ortho&#8211;amination of (poly)pyridyl mono&#8208; and di&#8208;N&#8208;oxides with good to excellent yield. The reactions are scalable and reproducible while using inexpensive, commercially available reagents.

         <title>Unsymmetrical Anthracene Platforms as Singlet Oxygen Batteries: Effects of Substituents on Photooxygenation and Endoperoxide Thermolysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsymmetrical anthracene derivatives have been synthetized and demonstrated a good ability to capture, store and release singlet oxygen (1O2). Kinetic studies performed by UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy revealed the influence of the substituents on the photooxygenation and the thermal cycloreversion steps. These derivatives appeared as promising 1O2 batteries for dark photooxygenation.







Abstract
Aromatic architectures able to capture, store and release singlet oxygen have sparked the interest of the scientific community as an attractive strategy to generate singlet oxygen. Among these structures, anthracenes are efficient singlet oxygen batteries with applications in various fields such as chemistry, materials science or medicine. Until now, studies have mainly focused on symmetrical 9,10&#8208;disubstituted anthracenes bearing (hetero)aryl groups or substituted alkyne motifs. In this work, we investigated unsymmetrical anthracene molecules to explore their propensity to trap and to release singlet oxygen. Kinetic studies confirmed the impact of electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient substituents on the photooxygenation step and on the release of singlet oxygen triggered by thermolysis of the endoperoxides.

         <title>Hydroxymethyl&#8208;Substituted Tetrathiatriarylmethanol with Variable Reactivity: Selective Access to Three Different Trityl Radicals by Unique Acid&#8208;Mediated Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of hydroxymethyl&#8208;substituted tetrathiatriarylmethanol with different acids are described. The reaction conditions were optimized for the selective synthesis of hydroxymethyl, methyl and aldehyde derivatives of trityl radicals as well as their deuterated analogues, which exhibit distinct EPR spectra and redox properties, thus suggesting applicability to in&#8208;cell EPR/dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP).







Abstract
Tetrathiatriarylmethyl radicals have found wide applications in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and imaging as well as dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). Recently, intense effort has been devoted to the derivatization of trityl radicals, but there is still a lack of highly efficient methods for access to these radicals. Herein, we report novel acid&#8208;mediated protocols for straightforward and selective synthesis of the hydroxymethyl, aldehyde and methyl derivatives of trityl radicals from the sole substrate hydroxymethyl&#8208;substituted tetrathiatriarylmethanol. The resulting trityl radicals exhibit various redox properties as shown by their cyclic voltammetric results. Importantly, the use of these protocols enables site&#8208;specific deuteration of the three trityl radicals, which show unique EPR spectral properties. Overall, our study reveals the crucial effect of the acids on the synthesis of these trityl radicals and provides a new approach for selective access to different trityl radicals, thus enriching their synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Boron Complexes of Tridentate Acyl Pyridylhydrazones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of boron complexes of tridentate acyl pyridylhydrazones were prepared. Their facile synthesis relies on arylboronic acids for boron incorporation, enabling significant structural diversity, dual&#8208;state emission, and reversible electrochemical reductions. Donor&#8208;acceptor architectures, constructed by leveraging triphenylamine and carbazole&#8208;functionalized arylboronic acids, result in aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement.







Abstract
Since the development of the chemistry and applications of boron dipyrromethene dyes (BODIPYs), numerous other platforms based on boron complexes of N&#8208;donor ligands have emerged as molecular optoelectronic materials. By tailoring the structure of the ligand bound to boron, the optical and electronic properties of a compound can be precisely tuned for unique properties, such as aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) in the case of boron difluoride hydrazones (BODIHYs). We examine the impact of modifying the typical bidentate hydrazone ligand structure used to prepare BODIHYs to enable a tridentate coordination mode to produce boron complexes of tridentate acyl pyridylhydrazones. This change allows for the use of arylboronic acids as sources of boron and facilitates the inclusion of complex organic components at the boron centre, including the formation of dye&#8208;dye conjugates. The synthesized compounds exhibit distinct optical and electronic properties when compared to BODIHYs, such as reversible electrochemical reduction and up to a &gt;300&#8197;nm pseudo&#8208;Stokes shift in the solid state, all of which were supported by density functional theory calculations.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecules containing ether skeletons are widely present in drugs, natural products, functional materials, and life science. Direct C(sp3)&#8211;H bond ether functionalization is considered a powerful strategy for the construction of novel ether derivatives.

         <title>Nitration of Pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines with NaNO2/HFIP</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild nitration of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines has been reached in a NaNO2/HFIP reaction system.







Abstract
A mild nitration of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines has been reached using sodium nitrite as nitro source in HFIP at ambient temperature. A variety of nitro&#8208;bearing pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline derivatives has been efficiently prepared in poor to quantitative yields (28&#8211;98&#8201;%). These products can be easily transformed to primary amines and amide by simple chemical reactions. Treatment of other nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles such as pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoline and substituted indoles under this developed reaction system afforded nitro&#8208;bearing N&#8208;heterocycles in relatively lower yields (15&#8211;19&#8201;%).

         <title>Synthesis and Application of a New Class of Planar and Centrally Chiral Ferrocenyl Amino Alcohol Ligands</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly enantioselective, facile, scalable, and robust synthesis of a new family (14 examples) of amino alcohol ligands possessing planar and central chirality that is described. They were applied to the diethylzinc and diphenylzinc additions to aldehydes with up to 98&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee and 82&#8201;% yield and 88&#8201;% ee, respectively.







Abstract
A family of ferrocenyl amino alcohols (14 examples) has been prepared from the corresponding planar chiral ketones and evaluated as a new class of chiral ligands for asymmetric ethyl&#8208; and phenylzinc additions to aldehydes. The highly enantioselective synthesis of these ligands is facile, scalable, robust and relies on the use of cheaply available starting materials. Asymmetric ethyl additions proceeded smoothly at ambient temperature, with reaction times as short as 1&#8197;hour furnishing the desired products in up to 90&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee. The corresponding phenyl additions afforded products in up to 81&#8201;% yield and 88&#8201;% ee. The observed stereochemical outcome for the addition of diethylzinc was rationalized and the key proposed transition state was supported by an analysis of the X&#8208;ray structures of a series of amino alcohol ligands.

         <dc:description>We report, an intramolecular ipso&#8208;halocyclization of N&#8208;arylpropynamides using readily available hypervalent iodine reagent as mild oxidant and alkali halides like KCl, KBr, and KI as the halogen source. Using this method, a broad range of valuable halogenated spiro[4.5]trienones can be obtained in an excellent yield at room temperature. Notably, this protocol doesn&#8217;t require para&#8208;substituents such as methoxy or fluoro group on the N&#8208;aryl ring. Also, this reaction takes place in the absence of any metal catalyst under aqueous conditions and exhibits a broad substrate scope with high functional group tolerance. A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed based on control experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 5,9&#8208;Diaza Analogues of [5]&#8208; and [6]Helicene and their Chiroptic and Photophysical Characterization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
5,9&#8208;Diaza[5]&#8208; and &#8208;[6]helicenes were synthesized by ortho,ortho&#8217; fusion of ortho&#8208;teraryls. The [6]helicene could be resolved in its enantiomers. Photophysical properties of both compounds were determined by measurements and calculations.







Abstract
6,10&#8208;Dipropyl&#8208;5,9&#8208;diaza[5]&#8208; and &#8208;[6]helicene were synthesized by ortho,ortho&#8217; fusion of ortho&#8208;teraryldicarboxamides. Key steps in the synthesis of the teraryls are azide formation with subsequent reduction and amidation followed by Suzuki cross couplings. The ortho fusions were achieved with phosphorus pentoxide and phosphoryl oxide. The total syntheses could be accomplished with 10&#8201;% and 3&#8201;%, respectively, in seven consecutive steps starting with meta&#8208;dibromobenzene. The helicenes were investigated by UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and by quantum chemical calculation of, inter alia, the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps. Racemization barriers of the helicenes were calculated, whereupon the optical resolution of 5,9&#8208;diaza[6]helicene was attempted and carried out successfully; ECD spectra were measured of its enantiomers.

&lt;p&gt;6,10-Dipropyl-5,9-diaza[5]- and -[6]helicene were synthesized by &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;ortho&#8217;&lt;/i&gt; fusion of &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-teraryldicarboxamides. Key steps in the synthesis of the teraryls are azide formation with subsequent reduction and amidation followed by Suzuki cross couplings. The &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt; fusions were achieved with phosphorus pentoxide and phosphoryl oxide. The total syntheses could be accomplished with 10&#8201;% and 3&#8201;%, respectively, in seven consecutive steps starting with &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-dibromobenzene. The helicenes were investigated by UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and by quantum chemical calculation of, &lt;i&gt;inter alia&lt;/i&gt;, the HOMO-LUMO gaps. Racemization barriers of the helicenes were calculated, whereupon the optical resolution of 5,9-diaza[6]helicene was attempted and carried out successfully; ECD spectra were measured of its enantiomers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We describe the one&#8208;pot direct N&#8208;acylation of indazole with carboxylic acids using DMAPO/Boc2O system. This system is simple and provides N1&#8208;acyl indazoles in high yield with high N1 selectivities. This new method exhibits a wide substrate scope (&gt;40 examples). In addition, a new synthesis of N1&#8208;functionalized alkyl indazoles utilizing N1&#8208;acyl indazoles as starting materials was achieved.







Abstract
This report describes the one&#8208;pot direct N&#8208;acylation of indazole with carboxylic acids using our previously developed 4&#8208;(N,N&#8208;dimethylamino)pyridine N&#8208;oxide (DMAPO)/di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl dicarbonate (Boc2O) system. This simple system provides N1&#8208;acyl indazoles in high yield with high N1 selectivities and does not require the use of activated derivatives of carboxylic acids or high temperatures. This new method exhibits a wide substrate scope (&gt;40 examples). In addition, a new synthesis of N1&#8208;functionalized alkyl indazoles utilizing N1&#8208;acyl indazoles as starting materials was achieved. This stepwise protocol is useful for the selective synthesis of structurally diverse N1&#8208;functionalized alkyl indazoles, which are difficult to synthesize by other methods such as the Mitsunobu reaction and classical SN2 alkylation of indazole.

         <title>Rational Design of Metallylenes for Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Theory&#8211;driven design! Using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical analyses, we screened the hydrogenation capability of a range of diverse metallylene catalysts with varying Group 14 atoms and ligands. Our design features identify that stannylenes featuring a phosphorus&#8211;based ligand have the potential to activate dihydrogen and facilitate the hydrogenation of a spectrum of unsaturated bonds.







Abstract
The hydrogenation of alkenes, alkynes, carbonyls, and imines by H2&#8208;activated metallylenes (H3C&#8722;EH2&#8722;L, CELH2; E=Si, Ge, Sn and L=NMe2, PMe2) was studied using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;BP86/TZ2P. By means of activation strain and Kohn&#8211;Sham molecular orbital analyses, the physical factors underlying the trends in reactivity were identified and quantified. Firstly, the hydrogenation reactivity increases on descending Group 14, that is from silylenes (E=Si) to stannylenes (E=Sn). This reactivity trend originates primarily from a reduced energy required to break the bonds between the Group&#8197;14 atom and the hydrogen atoms because the strength of these bonds decreases from Si&#8722;H to Ge&#8722;H to Sn&#8722;H. Secondly, the reactivity decreases as the Group&#8197;15 ligand changes from nitrogen to phosphorus (L=NMe2, PMe2) which stems from the trigonal pyramidal PMe2 geometry compared to the trigonal planar NMe2 geometry. The latter can, therefore, effectively engage in stronger orbital interactions with the substrate than the former, due to a more efficient HOMO&#8211;LUMO orbital overlap. By combining our insights, we rationally designed an optimally tuned catalyst (Group&#8197;14 atom and ligand) considering the overall catalytic cycle involving H2 activation of the metallylene and subsequent hydrogenation.

         <title>Decatungstate&#8208;Catalyzed Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Formation Between Furfural and Electron&#8208;Deficient Olefins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalization of furfural can be achieved by photocatalytic C&#8722;H activation of the aldehyde and coupling to electron&#8208;deficient olefins. With (Bu4N)4W10O32 as the photocatalyst, furfural can be added to benzylidene malononitriles, acrylates, itaconic anhydride, maleic anhydride, 2&#8208;vinylpyridine and phenyl vinyl sulfone to form the corresponding furanyl ketones in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields.







Abstract
Furfural is produced on a large commercial scale from lignocellulose and can be used for the preparation of several industrial chemicals with four to five carbon atoms. Further functionalization of furfural by C&#8722;H activation, however, is less widely developed. In the present work, tetrabutylammonium decatungstate is investigated as an inexpensive photocatalyst for activating the aldehyde C&#8722;H bond and mediate a coupling between furfural and electron&#8208;deficient olefins. The results show that furfural can be successfully added to benzylidene malononitriles, acrylates, itaconic anhydride, maleic anhydride, 2&#8208;vinylpyridine and phenyl vinyl sulfone to generate the corresponding furanyl ketones in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields. The electronic properties of the electron&#8208;deficient olefins are instrumental for achieving a favorable reaction with furfural. The findings show how photocatalysis can be used to form new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds from a platform molecule, which in this way can be converted into a number of more advanced structures.

         <title>Yttrium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydroamination of Norbornene with Simple Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydroamination of norbornene with simple amines remains a major challenge. Now the hydroamination of norbornene with such simple amines is reported, as well as the first rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of norbornenes.







Abstract
The intermolecular hydroamination of norbornene with simple amines was achieved using silyl&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;terphenoxide yttrium complexes. Excellent conversion was obtained for both benzylic and aliphatic amines. For benzyl and linear aliphatic amines, the highest activity was observed for the sterically more encumbered methyldiphenylsilyl&#8208;substituted complex, whereas the trimethylsilyl&#8208;substituted complex was more active for sterically encumbered primary amines.

     alt="Yttrium-Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydroamination of Norbornene with Simple Amines"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hydroamination of norbornene with simple amines remains a major challenge. Now the hydroamination of norbornene with such simple amines is reported, as well as the first rare-earth-metal-catalyzed hydroamination of norbornenes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intermolecular hydroamination of norbornene with simple amines was achieved using silyl-substituted &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-terphenoxide yttrium complexes. Excellent conversion was obtained for both benzylic and aliphatic amines. For benzyl and linear aliphatic amines, the highest activity was observed for the sterically more encumbered methyldiphenylsilyl-substituted complex, whereas the trimethylsilyl-substituted complex was more active for sterically encumbered primary amines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Regioselective Chlorosulfenylation of Indoles by Dimethylsulfoxide and 1,2&#8208;Dichloroethane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and cost&#8208;effective metal&#8208;free method for vicinal Csp2&#8722;H difunctionalization of indole was reported. The common solvents dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dichloroethane (DCE) were used as precursor to generate chlorodimethylsulfonium ion for electrophilic methylthiolation followed by chlorination by enabling 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;methylthioindoles.







Abstract
Direct chloromethylthiolation of the C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds of indole was achieved with the commonly used solvents dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dichloroethane (DCE). Initially, chlorodimethylsulfonium ion is generated in&#8197;situ from the reaction of DMSO and DCE on simple heating at 120&#8201;&#176;C and is used for electrophilic methylthiolation followed by chlorination, enabling the synthesis of 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;methylthioindoles.

         <title>A Green Approach to Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitutions of Nicotinic Esters in Cyrene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green choice: Cyrene has been used as an eco&#8208;friendly alternative to environmentally harmful polar aprotic solvents in SNAr reactions. This innovative protocol enabled the facile synthesis of a wide library of novel nicotinic esters, valuable precursors of bioactive compounds. This methodology could also be extended to scale&#8208;up processes, microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis, and one&#8208;pot telescoping reactions, thus enhancing its applicability in various eco&#8208;friendly synthetic contexts.







Abstract
The green solvent CyreneTM has emerged as a valuable substitute for conventional polar aprotic organic solvents such as DMF, DMSO and NMP (renowned for their toxicity and environmental concerns). However, in the presence of bases, Cyrene is prone to polymerization, thus potentially incompatible with reactions where a base is needed to generate reactive nucleophiles. In this study, we developed an efficient synthetic strategy for nucleophilic aromatic substitutions of nicotinic esters in Cyrene. The success of this protocol relies on a very short reaction time (only 15 minutes) which prevents polymerization from occurring. Indeed, Cyrene not only outperformed typical solvents such as DMF and DMSO, but also, being highly soluble in water, allowed an easy purification of the desired products by simple precipitation upon the addition of ice&#8208;water.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Ring Opening Reactions of Vinylcyclopropanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vinylcyclopropanes can be generally classified as activated and unactivated VCPs. Activated VCPs have strong electron withdrawing groups present in the cyclopropane ring, while unactivated VCPs lack strong electron withdrawing groups in their structures. These VCPs can be activated using suitable asymmetric catalysts to afford various types of chiral ring&#8208;opened products that are synthetically valuable compounds.







Abstract
Vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs) are important building blocks with multifaceted reactivity. Catalytic asymmetric ring opening of vinylcyclopropanes is a highly efficient process to access valuable chiral molecules with diverse functionalities that can be further functionalized for a series of synthetic purposes. VCPs are very well&#8208;known substrates for cycloaddition reactions and this chemistry has been widely explored. On the contrary, despite of enormous synthetic potential, development of new innovative strategies for the catalytic, asymmetric ring opening of VCPs is somewhat underdeveloped. Recently, several significant examples have emerged in the literature for various asymmetric ring opening of both activated and unactivated vinylcyclopropanes that involve transition metal catalysis. These developments are relevant additions to the vinylcyclopropane chemistry. In this review, we aim to summarize all the catalytic asymmetric ring opening transformations reported till date and provide a comprehensive analysis of these research outcomes.

         <title>Cooperativity in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Macrocycles Derived from Nucleobases</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical analyses reveal that introducing rigid linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated acetylene linkers into a supramolecular building block hampers the cooperative self&#8208;assembly of hydrogen&#8208;bonded macrocycles. This effect originates from the electron abstracting capability of the linker and becomes amplified when the size of the linker increases.







Abstract
Introducing a rigid linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated acetylene linker into a supramolecular building block consisting of a hydrogen&#8208;bond donor side and a hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor side yields a decrease in cooperativity in the resulting formed quartet. This follows from our Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital and Voronoi deformation density analyses of hydrogen&#8208;bonded macrocycles based on guanine and cytosine nucleobases. The acetylene linker abstracts electron density from the hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor and donor, making the hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor more negatively charged and the hydrogen&#8208;bond donor more positively charged and hence suppressing the donor&#8211;acceptor charge transfer interaction between the interacting fragments. This, ultimately, hampers the cooperativity in the hydrogen&#8208;bonded macrocycle. We envision that these findings could open the door to new design principles for the development of novel hydrogen&#8208;bond supramolecular macrocycles.
