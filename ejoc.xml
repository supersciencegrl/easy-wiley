Synthesis of 4&#8208;alkenylated pyrazolinones derivatives by 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ)&#8208;mediated oxidative coupling reaction of 1,3&#8208;diarylpropenes with pyrazolinones. The methodology has the advantages of metal&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot, high atom economy, and mild condition.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Diarylpropenes firstly serve as efficient alkenylated reagents for the functionalization of pyrazolinones. In the presence of 2,3&#8208;Dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ), it undergoes oxidative coupling and final dehydrogenation to give the highly substituted E,E&#8208;&#945;,&#946;,&#947;,&#948;&#8208;dienpyrazolinones in moderate to excellent yields.

         <title>Zinc Promoted Urea Synthesis Using Carbonyldiimidazole as Carbonyl Source and Its Application for the Synthesis of Cariprazine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward one&#8208;pot synthetic procedure is employed to synthesize both symmetrical and unsymmetrical urea by using a mild carbonyl source CDI, and Zn metal. This established approach is appropriate for all types of amines. We synthesized the FDA&#8208;approved Cariprazine drug molecule using this method.







Abstract
A convenient method has been developed for symmetrical and un&#8208;symmetrical urea synthesis by using Carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) and recyclable activated zinc metal. This reaction is suitable for all types of amines and gives the desired urea products with good to excellent yield. The developed synthetic approach was employed for the synthesis of the Cariprazine drug.

         <title>New advances in the synthesis of emerging cyclic amidrazones to foster bioisosterism of azaheterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pace and the scope of new molecules design is often constrained by limitations in synthetic chemistry. The azaheterocyclic amidrazones are of particular interest for bioisosteric considerations in drug discovery. However, the lack of efficient synthetic access has undoubtedly hampered their occurrence in the drug chemical space. Our current results describe a robust synthetic access relying on cyclization of aminohydrazine in presence of various orthoesters by either metal free&#8208; or metal&#8208;catalyzed condensations. This optimized synthetic access to cyclic amidrazones as original scaffold should inspire the chemist community and further drive innovation in the design of molecular structure for many applications (drug, materials, dyes&#8230;).</dc:description>

         <title>Progress in (Thio)urea&#8208; and Squaramide&#8208;Based Br&#248;nsted Base Catalysts with Multiple H&#8208;Bond Donors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nowadays chiral (thio)urea&#8208; and squaramide&#8208;based Br&#248;nsted base catalysts are widely applied to enantioselective carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond forming reactions. In recent years, variations of these catalysts that incorporate and additional H&#8208;bond donor unit (green remark) have been shown to perform often superior in terms of activity and stereoselectivity. This Review covers aspects on these catalysts design and their applications.







Abstract
Thiourea&#8208; and squaramide&#8208;based bifunctional base catalysts represent nowadays a powerful tool in the field of asymmetric catalysis and have demonstrated very efficient for promoting a wide variety of transformations enantioselectively. New versions that incorporate one or various additional H&#8208;bond donor site(s) in the catalyst structure have been developed recently which led to more active (reduced catalyst loadings) and selective catalysts. This review highlights the pioneering ideas and the most recent contributions to the area with the material organized according to the nature of the additional H&#8208;bond donor functionality. The advantages, current limitations and perspectives of these new multifunctional catalysts are discussed.

         <title>Synthesis of [60]Fullerene Hybrids Endowed with Steroids and Monosaccharides: Theoretical Underpinning as Promising anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Agents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New [60]fullerene hybrids endowed with steroid and monosaccharide moieties are obtained through a cyclopropanation reaction. The structure of monoadducts were determined by spectroscopic and analytical study. Theoretical calculations predicted the most stable conformations and determine the factors that control the hybrid molecules&#8242; geometry. The molecular docking studies suggested the possible application of these compounds as anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.







Abstract
Cyclopropanation reactions between C60 and different malonates decorated with monosaccharides and steroids using the Bingel&#8208;Hirsch methodology have allowed the obtention of a new family of hybrid compounds in good yields. A complete set of instrumental techniques has allowed us to fully characterize the hybrid derivatives and to determine the chemical structure of monocycloadducts. Besides, the proposed structures were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, which evidenced the exclusive reductive pattern of fullerene Bingel&#8208;type monoadducts. Theoretical calculations at the DFT&#8208;D3(BJ)/PBE 6&#8208;311G(d,p) level of the synthesized conjugates predict the most stable conformation and determine the factors that control the hybrid molecules&#8242; geometry. Some parameters such as polarity, lipophilicity, polar surface area, hydrophilicity index, and solvent&#8208;accessible surface area were also estimated, predicting its potential permeability and capability as cell membrane penetrators. Additionally, a molecular docking simulation has been carried out using the main protease of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (Mpro) as the receptor, thus paving the way to study the potential application of these hybrids in biomedicine.

Besides, the proposed structures were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, which evidenced the exclusive reductive pattern of fullerene Bingel-type monoadducts. Theoretical calculations at the DFT-D3(BJ)/PBE 6-311G(d,p) level of the synthesized conjugates predict the most stable conformation and determine the factors that control the hybrid molecules&#8242; geometry. Some parameters such as polarity, lipophilicity, polar surface area, hydrophilicity index, and solvent-accessible surface area were also estimated, predicting its potential permeability and capability as cell membrane penetrators. Additionally, a molecular docking simulation has been carried out using the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro) as the receptor, thus paving the way to study the potential application of these hybrids in biomedicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NHC&#8208;Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Annulation of Alkynoic Acids with Unactivated Alkenes in Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical and green NHC&#8208;palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade annulation of alkynoic acids with unactivated alkenes under an oxygen atmosphere in ionic liquid for the assembly of structurally diverse alkyl substituted &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactones is accomplished. In the presence of 0.5&#8197;mol% of IPr&#8722;Pd&#8722;Py&#8722;Cl2 in [Amim]Cl, both the alkynoic acids and unactivated alkenes were well tolerated, thus giving the desired products in moderate to good yields with excellent Z/E selectivity.







Abstract
An N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene palladium (NHC&#8208;palladium)&#8208;catalyzed cascade annulation of alkynoic acids with unactivated alkenes under an oxygen atmosphere in ionic liquids is described. This protocol enables facile access for the preparation of diverse alkyl substituted &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactones in moderate to good yields with excellent Z/E selectivity. Moreover, the ionic liquid not only acts as the green solvent, but also as the eco&#8208;friendly chlorine source, thus avoiding the use of excess metal halides such as cupric chloride. Some preliminary mechanistic studies were performed, which further revealed possible pathways for this cascade annulation.

Nitro&#8208;substituted donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes when heated with pyrazoles in DMSO give oxoamination products through tandem Kornblum&#8208;type ring&#8208;opening oxidation/aza&#8208;Michael addition sequence.







Abstract
The ring&#8208;opening reaction of nitro&#8208;substituted donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes with pyrazoles in DMSO was investigated. Unexpectedly, the cyclopropanes underwent Kornblum&#8208;type ring&#8208;opening oxidation with DMSO to form aroylmethylidene malonates as intermediates in the reactions. The intermediates further underwent aza&#8208;Michael addition with pyrazoles in tandem manner to give the corresponding aza&#8208;Michael adducts. The highlights of the methodology include the occurrence of ring&#8208;opening/oxidation under neutral conditions with DMSO and formation of aza&#8208;Michael adducts with pyrazoles under catalyst&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>Synthesis of Flavin&#8208;Indole Conjugates with Rigid Diamino Linkers as Cryptochrome Model Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepwise reductive aminations of aldehydes derived from indole and flavin with rigid 1,4&#8208;diaminocyclohexane and 2,6&#8208;diamino&#8208;trans&#8208;decalin linkers furnished two model compounds for avian cryptochromes. Radical pair formation by light&#8208;induced electron&#8208;transfer in such dyads was proposed to show a magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;dependent quantum effect.







Abstract
The synthesis of flavin&#8208;indole conjugates with a trans&#8208;1,4&#8208;diaminocyclohexane and a 2,6&#8208;diaminodecahydronaphthalene linker is reported. Both compounds should serve as artificial model compounds for natural cryptochrome. It is assumed that cryptochrome photoreceptor proteins located in the retina show a light&#8208;dependent quantum effect which enables migratory birds to perceive the Earth's magnetic field and is thus used for navigation. Both model compounds were prepared by stepwise reductive aminations of indole carbaldehyde and a flavin&#8208;substituted acetaldehyde with the appropriate diamine linkers. The hitherto unknown 2,6&#8208;diaminodecahydronaphthalene was prepared in four steps from 2,6&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene as the achiral (meso) ax,ax,trans&#8208;diastereoisomer. The configuration of this key intermediate as well as synthetic precursors has been established by a series of X&#8208;ray single crystal analyses.

         <dc:description>
Two insect pheromones with &#948;&#8208;lactone moiety were accessed from a cyclic &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoester. The key step is the cyanide&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;transformation yielding the &#948;&#8208;lactone unit.







Abstract
The cyanide&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;transformation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoesters to &#948;&#8208;lactones with exocyclic ester moiety is the key transformation for the preparation of racemic 5&#8208;hexadecanolide (15&#8201;% over nine steps) and 6&#8208;acetoxy&#8208;5&#8208;hexadecanolide (22&#8201;% over eight steps), two insect pheromones. The benzyloxycarbonyl moiety is transformed via the acid chloride to the undecanoyl side chain. After reduction of the ketone to the secondary alcohol, this functional group was either reduced via the chloro compound to furnish the 5&#8208;hexadecanolide. On the other hand, stereoselective reduction of the ketone gave secondary alcohol with the wrong relative configuration, which was established by X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structure. Inversion was achieved by reaction of the methanesulfonate with cesium acetate yielding (R*,S*)&#8208;6&#8208;acetoxy&#8208;5&#8208;hexadecanolide with the relative configuration also present in the natural product.

         <title>ortho&#8208;Quinols in (Bio)Synthesis of Natural Products</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ortho&#8208;Quinols are chiral 6&#8208;alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxycyclohexa&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienone derivatives of interest to organic chemists because of their natural occurrence, their role as intermediates in the biosynthesis of diverse natural products, and the versatility of their chemical reactivity. Readily accessible from dearomative oxygenation of 2&#8208;alkylphenols or other arenols, ortho&#8208;quinols constitute useful molecular entities from which structural complexity can be rapidly built, as highlighted herein through many examples of targeted syntheses of natural products, such as trichodimerol.







Abstract
6&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxycyclohexa&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienone derivatives, commonly referred to as ortho&#8208;quinols, and their simple ester and ether variants constitute a class of organic compounds that aroused much interest amongst chemists over the past 70&#8197;years for several reasons related to organic synthesis, natural product chemistry and biochemistry. It was very early on that organic chemists understood the potential of the unique yet versatile chemical reactivity of such compounds to synthesize more complex structures, and it soon emerged that ortho&#8208;quinols could constitute key intermediates in the biosynthesis of certain natural products of various origins. This minireview discusses the chemistry of ortho&#8208;quinols from the point of view of their role in the synthesis and biosynthesis of natural products. Examples of completed syntheses of natural products mostly taken in the literature of the last 20&#8197;years or so, together with some chosen pieces from older but pioneering and most remarkable works, are highlighted to illustrate this discussion.

It was very early on that organic chemists understood the potential of the unique yet versatile chemical reactivity of such compounds to synthesize more complex structures, and it soon emerged that &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-quinols could constitute key intermediates in the biosynthesis of certain natural products of various origins. This minireview discusses the chemistry of &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-quinols from the point of view of their role in the synthesis and biosynthesis of natural products. Examples of completed syntheses of natural products mostly taken in the literature of the last 20&#8197;years or so, together with some chosen pieces from older but pioneering and most remarkable works, are highlighted to illustrate this discussion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Comparison of [18F]F&#8208;CNBI and [18F]F&#8208;CNPIFE as Positron Emission Tomography Probes for Noninvasive Imaging of Glycogen Synthase Kinase&#8208;3 in Normal Mice</title>

This study presents comparative uptake of two positron emission tomography (PET) probes [18F]F&#8208;CNBI and [18F]F&#8208;CNPIFE for imaging of the Glycogen Synthase Kinase&#8208;3&#945;/&#946; in normal FVB/NJ mouse brain. Developed PET probes showed nanomolar affinity towards GSK&#8208;3&#945;/&#946;. The PET probe [18F]F&#8208;CNPIFE showed order of magnitude higher brain uptake than [18F]F&#8208;CNBI in FVB/NJ mouse.







Abstract
Glycogen synthase kinase&#8208;3 &#945;/&#946; is involved in dysregulation of neuronal tau protein in Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is an unmet clinical need for a blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) permeable positron emission tomography (PET) probe for imaging of GSK&#8208;3&#945;/&#946; in the brain to understand the pathogenesis of AD. Herein, we synthesized two PET probes, [18F]F&#8208;CNBI and [18F]F&#8208;CNPIFE, and evaluated their BBB permeability and affinity towards GSK&#8208;3&#945;/&#946;. [19F]F&#8208;CNPIFE showed higher in&#8208;vitro binding towards GSK&#8208;3&#945;/&#946; (IC50=19.4&#177;2.5&#8197;nM; n=3, for GSK&#8208;3&#945;, IC50=19.4&#177;3.8&#8197;nM; n=3, for GSK&#8208;3&#946;) compared to [19F]F&#8208;CNBI (IC50=107.6&#177;26.0&#8197;nM; n=4, for GSK&#8208;3&#945;, IC50=105.3&#177;18.2&#8197;nM; n=3, for GSK&#8208;3&#946;). [18F]F&#8208;CNPIFE showed 9.5&#8208;fold higher brain uptake than [18F]F&#8208;CNBI, in normal FVB/NJ mice, which was increased by additional 1.5&#8208;fold on co&#8208;administration of [19F]F&#8208;CNPIFE with respect to [18F]F&#8208;CNBI. Overall, [18F]F&#8208;CNPIFE is a promising PET probe for GSK&#8208;3&#945;/&#946; imaging and warrants further evaluation in an AD mouse model.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Disubstituted 3&#8208;Isoquinolinone Derivatives through the Construction of C&#8722;N, C=O, and C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) Bonds under Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Conditions</title>

         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step construction of C&#8722;N, C=O and C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions for the synthesis of disubstituted 3&#8208;isoquinolinone derivatives is reported. The reaction is characterized by wide substrate scope, high selectivity and environmental friendliness.







Abstract
The efficient three&#8208;component cascade coupling reaction of 3&#8208;haloisoquinolines, haloalkanes, and sp3&#8208;carbon nucleophiles (acetophenone or nitromethane) led to a series of structurally novel 1,2&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;3&#8208;isoquinolinones through the formation of C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2), C&#8722;N, and C=O bonds. The NaOAc&#8208;promoted reaction described in this work is simple to operate, environment friendly, and highly selective.

A series of enantiomerically enriched 2&#8208;spirocyclopentyl&#8208;indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones were obtained through a phosphine&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition between aza&#8208;aurones and allenoates.







Abstract
An enantioselective phosphine&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition between aza&#8208;aurones and allenoates is here described. The reaction proceeded under mild reaction conditions to afford 2&#8208;spirocyclopentyl indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one derivatives as single &#947;&#8208;isomer and with high levels of stereocontrol.

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid Promoted Sulfonylation of Propargylic Alcohols: Synthesis of Triaryl Allenyl Sulfones under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 3, January 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;promoted sulfonylation of propargylic alcohols with sodium sulfinates as a sulfonyl source was developed for the synthesis of triaryl allenyl sulfones. This transformation proceeds well to give various triaryl&#8208;substituted allenyl sulfones in moderate to excellent yields under mild conditions.







Abstract
An efficient and practical approach for the synthesis of triaryl allenyl sulfones from easily accessible propargylic alcohols was developed, by using sodium sulfinates as a sulfonyl source in the presence of Br&#248;nsted acid. The reaction proceeded via allenyl carbocation as the key intermediate and was followed by a nucleophilic attack of sodium sulfinates to produce allenyl sulfones in moderate to excellent yields.

         <title>Vanadium Catalyst for C&#8208; and S&#8208;Alkylation of Benzhydrols in Water: An Experimental Study and Green Metrics Evaluation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 3, January 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use strategy is reported that forms C&#8722;C and C&#8722;S bonds with a divanadium oxoperoxo catalyst. The reaction works well with various substrates in water under aerobic conditions.







Abstract
A strategy for the vanadium&#8208;catalyzed dehydrative C&#8208; and S&#8208;alkylation by nucleophilic substitution of benzhydrols with arenes and thiols is reported. The alkylation was achieved with the divanadium oxoperoxo complex [K3(V+5)2(O22&#8722;)4(O2&#8722;)2(&#956;&#8208;OH)] in water under air. The newly developed transformation could accommodate a broad substrate scope, including (hetero)arenes and thiols (34 examples). Both the symmetrical and unsymmetrical benzhydrols furnished excellent yields of the alkylated product under mild reaction conditions. The scope of this strategy was further extended to synthesize bis&#8208;benzylated arenes (poly&#8208;arylated products) in high yields and regioselectivities. The green metrics determination of all the alkylated products suggests the technical and environmental benefits of the present protocol. The longevity experiment reveals the catalytic activity was maintained over seven cycles. To understand the mechanism of the present reaction, spectroscopic and kinetic studies were undertaken. This simple protocol, which affords the desired products with water as the by&#8208;product, can be achieved under mild conditions without needing a base or other additives.

Abstract
An efficient and simple procedure for the preparation of 2&#8208;pyridinone is reported. The obtained products contained various bicyclic 2&#8208;pyridinones and multi&#8208;substituted 6&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinones. This approach employed 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;aryl acrylate and nitro ketene aminal as substrates, and the corresponding 2&#8208;pyridinones were obtained in good to excellent yields. This method may be used for the synthesis of bicyclic 2&#8208;pyridinones, as well as multi&#8208;substituted complex 2&#8208;pyridinones.

A novel total synthesis of licochalcone C on an up to 30&#8197;g scale was disclosed that relied on the directed ortho&#8208;metalation of bis&#8208;O&#8208;MOM&#8208;protected resorcinol for the regioselective C&#8208;prenylation, followed by metalation&#8208;formylation, selective O&#8208;deprotection &#8211; methylation, and aldol reaction with p&#8208;hydroxyacetophenone. The synthesis of related licoagrochalcones B, C, and D was also performed.







Abstract
A novel efficient method for the synthesis of licochalcone C in good yield on up to 30&#8197;g scale was developed. The reaction sequence included relied on the directed ortho&#8208;metalation (DOM) of bis&#8208;O&#8208;MOM&#8208;protected resorcinol for the regioselective C&#8208;prenylation, followed by metalation&#8208;formylation, selective O&#8208;deprotection of a hydroxyl group located between the formyl and prenyl groups, its methylation, and aldol reaction with p&#8208;hydroxyacetophenone. Synthesis of structurally related retrochalcones, i.e., licoagrochalcones B, C, and D, was also proposed.

         <title>Origins of the Reactivity in 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions of Acyl Isocyanide Ylides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 3, January 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A toolbox of quantum chemical&#8208;based methods is used to elucidate the reactivity of acyl&#8208;isocyanide ylides in 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions. The theoretical analysis reveals two general modes of action depending on the electronic properties of the dipolarophile.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Dipolar cycloadditions are the preferred method to generate five&#8208;membered heterocyclic rings. Surprisingly, cycloadditions based on acyl&#8208;isocyanide ylides have remained underexplored by the chemical community. Acyl&#8208;isocyanide ylides readily react with dipolarophiles, such as substituted alkenes, to yield &#916;1&#8208;pyrroline derivatives. As an explanation for the observed reactivity of this reaction is lacking, extensive density functional theory calculations were performed to scrutinize the mechanistic features of the transformation. Herein we explain the experimental outcome of the reaction using a variety of reactivity theories and predict opposed regioselectivity for electron&#8208;poor and electron&#8208;rich dipolarophiles. With the insights obtained, we hope to incentivize the design of new cycloaddition reactions based on the acyl&#8208;isocyanide ylides motif.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;(Acyloxy)carboxylic Acids and &#947;&#8208;Lactones Featuring the Switch of Stereopreference of Candida antarctica Lipase B in Sodium &#947;&#8208;Hydroxycarboxylate Homologues</title>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of enantiomeric &#947;&#8208;(acyloxy)carboxylic acids and &#947;&#8208;lactones from racemic &#947;&#8208;lactones is reported, which involves lipase&#8208;catalyzed acylation of &#947;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acid sodium salts in organic solvent followed by relactonization of the unreacted enantiomer. The products were separated by extraction, no column chromatography is needed.







Abstract
Scalable protocols of straightforward synthesis of enantiomeric &#947;&#8208;(acyloxy)carboxylic acids and &#947;&#8208;lactones are presented. The key step is lipase&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective acylation of &#947;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acid sodium salt in organic solvent followed by acidification of the product, extraction and acidic relactonization of the unreacted enantiomer. The mixture of &#947;&#8208;(acyloxy)carboxylic acid and &#947;&#8208;lactone is separated either by extraction with solution of sodium bicarbonate or by distillation. A switch of enantioinduction of Candida antarctica lipase B along homologous nucleophiles from R configuration of &#947;&#8208;hydroxyhexanoic acid salt to S configuration of the C7 and longer&#8208;chain homologues has been disclosed. Both enantiomers of &#947;&#8208;(acyloxy)pentanoic acids; &#947;&#8208;(acetyloxy)octanoic and &#8208;nonanoic acids with S configuration; [(1S,5R)&#8208;5&#8208;(chloroacetyloxy)cyclopent&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl]acetic acid and enantiomeric &#947;&#8208;lactones derived from them were prepared with e.&#8201;r. &gt;98.5/1.5. The rates of acylation of C5 to C9 homologous salts differ by three orders of magnitude but remain applicable for preparative synthesis by variation of the enzyme loading and reaction time.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Free Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Mizoroki&#8208;Heck Reaction Strategy for the One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Functionalized Oxygen Heterocycles in Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 3, January 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligandless, telescoped, one&#8208;pot reductive Mizoroki&#8208;Heck reactions proceed smoothly and regioselectively in eco&#8208;friendly eutectic mixtures, and under aerobic conditions to yield 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl THF or THP derivatives in up to 95&#8201;% yield. Key intermediates have also been targeted in DES en route to pharmacologically relevant molecules.







Abstract
A Deep Eutectic Solvent, choline chloride/glycerol (1&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;mol&#8201;mol&#8722;1), proved to be an effective and sustainable reaction medium to promote telescoped, one&#8208;pot Mizoroki&#8208;Heck cross&#8208;coupling/reduction processes between 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran or 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran and several (hetero)aryl halides to easily access valuable 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl tetrahydrofuran (THF) or tetrahydropyran derivatives in up to 95&#8201;% yield. Notably, the whole transformation takes place under aerobic conditions, in the absence of additional ligands, and with a good substrate scope. The practicability of the method is also exemplified by the sustainable synthesis of two key THF derivatives, which are side chains of pharmacologically relevant inhibitors of Kv1.2 channel.

The Front Cover illustrates the reaction conditions for the straightforward synthesis of oxygen heterocycles in Deep Eutectic Solvents. Similar to dandelions, which are objects of great natural beauty, design and efficiency in delivering fruits from their round heads, two Pd&#8208;catalysts work synergistically and efficiently in a choline chloride&#8208;based eutectic mixture to allow telescoped, one&#8208;pot reductive Mizoroki&#8211;Heck reactions between DHF or DHP and (hetero)aryl halides to successfully provide tetrahydrofuran or tetrahydropyran derivatives in up to 95&#8201;% yield.

         <title>Stereoselective Domino Heck&#8208;Suzuki Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 3, January 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exocyclic tetra&#8208;substituted carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds in uniform configuration and creation of tertiary or quaternary stereogenic centers in a diastereoselective or enantioselective manner &#8211; these are structural motives that are accessible by a cascade consisting of a Heck reaction and subsequent Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling with suitable palladium catalysts that guarantee a high degree of stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Palladium catalysis enables efficient and versatile domino reactions that are initiated by an intramolecular Mizoroki&#8208;Heck reaction and then terminated by a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling. The stereochemistry of this cascade is concerned under three aspects: Firstly, as stereoselective formation of carbon&#8722;carbon&#8208;double bonds, when the initial carbometalation occurs at an alkyne moiety. Secondly as diastereoselective and thirdly enantioselective formation of stereogenic carbon centers when the intramolecular Heck step is directed to an alkene moiety. Valuable protocols lead to &#8211; otherwise not easily accomplished &#8211; stereo control in the formation of tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted double bonds according to the first conception. The diastereoselective versions permit the formation of multiple stereocenters in mono&#8208; and polycycles. Enantioselective protocols were developed only recently. The fact that the newly created stereocenters are highly&#8208;substituted, tertiary or quaternary ones, makes the methods that are presented in this review useful and versatile tools in synthesis.

The stereochemistry of this cascade is concerned under three aspects: Firstly, as stereoselective formation of carbon&#8722;carbon-double bonds, when the initial carbometalation occurs at an alkyne moiety. Secondly as diastereoselective and thirdly enantioselective formation of stereogenic carbon centers when the intramolecular Heck step is directed to an alkene moiety. Valuable protocols lead to &#8211; otherwise not easily accomplished &#8211; stereo control in the formation of tri- and tetra-substituted double bonds according to the first conception. The diastereoselective versions permit the formation of multiple stereocenters in mono- and polycycles. Enantioselective protocols were developed only recently. The fact that the newly created stereocenters are highly-substituted, tertiary or quaternary ones, makes the methods that are presented in this review useful and versatile tools in synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>O&#8208;Acylative Vinylation of Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based [3]Rotaxane Towards Rotaxane Crosslinkers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The acylation of cyclodextrin&#8208;based [3]rotaxane was implemented with anhydride reagents following a facile procedure. Methacrylic anhydride facilitated the introduction of the vinyl&#8208;group into the rotaxane structure toward achieving a crosslinker. Interestingly, only a few methacrylic units were attached to the cyclodextrin at reaction temperatures of up to 60 &#176;C even with an excess amount of the reagent, probably due to steric hindrance. Therefore, the number of vinyl groups on the [3]rotaxane framework was easily controlled to be approximately two units via a simple random acylation, which worked effectively as a facile synthesis route for the rotaxane crosslinker. The acylation behavior was investigated in detail by NMR and MALDI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS analyses. The vinylated [3]rotaxane was successfully used as a crosslinker to obtain a rotaxane&#8208;crosslinked polymer. The proposed approach will help overcome the trade&#8208;off between convenience and utility associated with the mono&#8208; modification of cyclodextrin.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Synthesis of ortho&#8208;Thiolated Aryl Esters Enabled with Thiocarbonate through Catellani Strategy</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a one&#8208;step strategy for the efficient syntheses of 2&#8208;arylthio aryl esters by palladium/norbornene/copper cooperative catalysis using thiocarbonate as bifunctional reagents. It is worth mentioning that this strategy accommodates broad substrate scopes wtih excellent functional group tolerance and can be easily scale&#8208;up.







Abstract
Herein, we report a palladium/norbornene/copper co&#8208;catalyzed single&#8208;step approach that merges selective ortho C&#8722;H bond esterification with ipso thiolation for construction of synthetically versatile 2&#8208;arylthio aryl esters under exceptionally mild conditions. Importantly, this process proceeded in a highly efficient manner, allowing alkoxycarbonyl and thio groups to be installed into one aryl iodides simultaneously by harnessing thiocarbonate as bifunctional reagent. The method has been demonstrated to accommodate good functionalities and features broad substrate scope.

         <title>Oxidative Coupling of 4&#8208;Hydroxycoumarins with Quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones Induced by Visible Light under Aerobic Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green protocol was developed for the cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;ones and 2&#8208;hydroxycoumarin derivatives, only using the Fukuzumi photocatalyst and visible light to obtain hybrid drug&#8208;like molecules in a single step.







Abstract
Direct and selective C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp2)&#8722;H cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling has become a promising strategy to increase molecular complexity with a high atom economy. This study describes an efficient and straightforward protocol for the regioselective C3&#8208;H/C3&#8208;H cross&#8208;coupling of 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarin derivatives with quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones, including late&#8208;stage modification of natural drugs, promoted by visible light under aerobic conditions at room temperature. With this approach, a wide range of hybrid drug&#8208;like molecules were prepared, using air as the terminal oxidant. Remarkably, the C4&#8208;OH group at the coumarin ring is essential for the reaction and has been used as a handle for diverse functionalizations of the final products. Moreover, sunlight can promote the reaction under very mild and sustainable conditions, even on a gram scale. Qualitative and semi&#8208;quantitative tools were used to demonstrate the greenness advance of this methodology over previously reported ones. Several experiments were conducted to propose a plausible mechanism for this transformation.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective C(sp2)&#8722;H Acetoxylation of Tyrosine&#8208;Containing Peptides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The site&#8208;selective modification of peptides in a tailored fashion represents a challenging task of prime interest in chemical biology and organic synthesis. We strategically transform the phenol ring within Tyr into a chelating group to further direct a C&#8722;H acetoxylation event. As a result, acetoxylation occurs regardless of the Tyr unit position within the peptide sequence.







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H acetoxylation of Tyr&#8208;containing peptides is described. The method relies on the use of a removable 2&#8208;pyridyloxy group as directing group and is distinguished by its reliable scalability and easily tuned regioselectivity to perform mono&#8208; and diacetoxylation reactions. Remarkably, the assembly of L&#8211;DOPA peptidomimetics is beyond reach upon cleavage of the directing group.

         <title>Divergent Total Synthesis of Fornicin A, Fornicin D, and Ganodercin D, Meroterpenoids from Ganoderma Mushrooms</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The meroterpenoids fornicin A (1), ganodercin D (3), and fornicin D (2), found in mushrooms of the Ganoderma genus, have been prepared in a concise and divergent synthesis route, starting from readily accessible building blocks.







Abstract
The meroterpenoids fornicin A, fornicin D, and ganodercin D, found in mushrooms of the Ganoderma genus, have been prepared in a concise and divergent synthesis route. The characteristic unsaturated &#947;&#8208;ketoacid moiety was obtained via an optimized step&#8208;wise aldol condensation between two readily accessible building blocks. THP&#8208;protection of a phenolic hydroxyl group under basic conditions was developed, a protocol that adds to the versatility of this protecting group.

A series of N&#8208;benzyl/allyl&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;benzothiazolamines were obtained smoothly from 1&#8208;(2&#8208;Iodophenyl)&#8208;3&#8208;phenylthioureas and benzyl/allyl halides via one&#8208;pot manner. The protocol features easily available starting materials, easy performance, mild reaction conditions, good yields and broad substrates scope, illustrating its synthetic value for the synthesis of a diversity of biologically or pharmaceutically active compounds.







Abstract
A facile method for the copper&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;benzothiazolamines was explored. In the presence of CuI, N&#8208;phenylbenzothiazolamines was in situ generated from substituted 1&#8208;(2&#8208;iodophenyl)&#8208;3&#8208;phenylthioureas, which susequently underwent coupling with benzyl/allyl halides to give the desired N&#8208;benzyl/allyl&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;benzothiazolamines fluently in a one&#8208;pot manner. The protocol features easy performance, easily available materials, good yield and broad substrates scope, showing potential synthetic value for the preparation of a variety of biologically or pharmaceutically active compounds.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Aculenes B and D</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of aculenes B and D was accomplished in 14 and 16 steps, respectively, from a known hydroxy carboxylic acid by employing a diastereoselective Barbier reaction as the key step. Reversal of the stereoselectivity was observed between the Barbier reaction of a &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208;aldehyde intermediate and that of its acetal&#8208;protected congener.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of aculene D, a structurally rare nordaucane&#8208;type natural product exhibiting quorum sensing inhibitory activity, has been accomplished from a known five&#8208;membered hydroxy carboxylic acid. Nucleophilic addition of methallylzinc bromide to a &#946;&#8208;keto aldehyde intermediate under Barbier conditions to install the secondary hydroxy group on the seven&#8208;membered ring of aculene D gave the corresponding alcohol with an undesired configuration predominantly. On the other hand, the protection of its keto group as the ethylene acetal induced a reversal of diastereoselectivity, affording a desired diastereomer in a selective manner. The construction of the seven&#8208;membered ring was realized by ring&#8208;closing metathesis using a triethylsilyl&#8208;protected monocyclic diene ester precursor. An additional five&#8208;step manipulation on the cyclization product including the installation of an ethyl group on the five&#8208;membered ring completed the synthesis of aculene D, whose esterification with an N&#8208;protected l&#8208;proline followed by deprotection also achieved the first total synthesis of aculene B.

         <title>Radical Arylaminoformylation of Activated Alkenes to Amides Containing All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Stereocenters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ag+/S2O82&#8722;&#8208;inducted radical process for functionalized succinyl diamides bearing a &#945;&#8208;quaternary carbon center through one&#8208;pot aminoformylation/aryl&#8208;migration/desulfonylation cascade has been proposed. This protocol with good tolerance to oxygen and water provides a complementary way for the aminoformylation/aromatization of alkenes as well.







Abstract
Herein we report an Ag+/S2O82&#8722; inducted measure for functionalized succinyl diamides bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter via a radical aminoformylation/aryl&#8208;migration/desulfonylation cascade. The improved process is developed employing readily available and inexpensive oxalic monoamide as a carbamoyl radical precursor through radical Smiles rearrangement. Additionally, the tolerance to oxygen and water, operational simplicity, convenient reagents, as well as scalability, enhance the practical value of the proposed synthesis strategy.

A protocol for the assembly of polysubstituted 2,3&#8208;dioxo&#8208;1,4,5,6&#8208;tetrahydropyrazines and 2,3&#8208;dioxo&#8208;hydro&#8208;1H&#8208;cycloalkyl[b]pyrazines by the sequential reaction of primary aliphatic amines, 1,2&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes and oxalyl chloride is reported.

Abstract
A novel protocol for the assembly of polysubstituted 2,3&#8208;dioxo&#8208;1,4,5,6&#8208;tetrahydropyrazines and 2,3&#8208;dioxo&#8208;hydro&#8208;1H&#8208;cycloalkyl[b]pyrazines has been developed by the sequential three&#8208;component reaction of primary aliphatic amines, 1,2&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes (DDs) and oxalyl chloride. This synthetic sequence proceeds by initial aza&#8208;Michael addition of the amine to the azo&#8208;ene compounds and subsequent ring closure involving the oxalyl chloride. The ready availability of the starting materials as well as the high level of practicability of the reaction and work&#8208;up make this approach an attractive opportunity towards these uncommon systems.

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized Proline&#8208;Derived Azabicycloalkane Amino Acids and Their Applications in Drug Discovery: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proline&#8208;derived azabicycloalkane amino acids are an important class of constrained dipeptide mimics. The presence of &#8220;easy&#8208;to&#8208;functionalize&#8221; chemical moieties onto their bicyclic core allows for the preparation of azabicycloalkane&#8208;based derivatives with improved biopharmaceutical properties. In this Review, the most relevant approaches to gain functionalized azabicycloalkane amino acids and their recent applications in drug discovery are summarized.







Abstract
After the first synthesis reported in 1994, azabicycloalkane amino acids have raised increasing interest, becoming one of the most important classes of constrained dipeptide mimics. Their incorporation into peptidomimetic structures allowed the obtainment of a wide range of biologically active compounds. Over the years, different research groups have worked at the development of synthetic strategies to gain these rigid dipeptide surrogates, nevertheless, methods affording functionalized and &#8220;easy&#8208;to&#8208;functionalize&#8221; derivatives are quite less described. The presence of a derivatizable azabicycloalkanone core could allow the introduction of chemical modifications aimed to improve the pharmaceutical properties of a biologically active compound without the need for redesigning its chemical synthesis. This account has collected and critically surveyed relevant approaches to the synthesis of functionalized azabicycloalkane amino acids, focusing the attention on the period of 2010 to the present. Moreover, recent applications of these compounds in drug discovery will be discussed.

         <dc:description>
(E)&#8208;(Quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethene oligomers with a maximum of six repetition units were successfully synthesized through multistep reactions using Wittig coupling of different quinoxaline units.







Abstract
New oligomers based on quinoxaline units were successfully synthesized through multistep reactions using Wittig coupling, affording (E)&#8208;(quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethene oligomers. Diverse quinoxaline&#8208;based phosphonium salts were designed and synthesized, enabling versatility and compatibility regarding the oligomer&#8208;building process. The characterization of the oligomers showed excellent stereoisomer specificity, i.e., a fully E&#8208;configurated conjugated &#960;&#8208;system. The oligomers&#8217; light absorption/emission profiles indicate potential properties for an application in materials science.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Transfer Hydrodebromination of Aryl Bromides with Ethanol</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convenient PNP pincer manganese catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of bromides to corresponding debrominated aryl compounds using ethanol as the hydrogen source is reported. The application of biomass&#8208;derived ethanol highlights the sustainability of the methodology.







Abstract
A convenient PNP pincer manganese catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of bromides to corresponding debrominated aryl compounds using ethanol as the hydrogen sources is reported. Importantly, the application of biomass&#8208;derived ethanol highlights the sustainability of the methodology. The use of 6&#8208;phenyl substituted triazine&#8208;based PiprN5Pipr manganese pincer catalyst allows for the debromination of various aryl bromides with good yields. Notably, the process also occurs with bromides derived from several classes of natural products and bioactive compounds, such as citronellol, diacetone fructose, cholesterol, and vitamin E.

         <title>Strapped Porphyrins as Model Systems for Atropisomeric Photosensitizer Drugs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The time dependence of atropisomer interconversion has limited the pursuit of single atropisomer drug candidates, even in circumstances where one atropisomer presents favorable biological activity over another. Moderate interconversion energy barriers risk compromising drug stability. As a result, examples of atropisomerically pure drugs in current clinical use are rare. However, in recent years, there has been a shift towards the development of single, stable atropisomer drug candidates with enhanced activity. Consequently, development of methods which effectively restrict rotation in a configuration which favors activity are highly beneficial. The picket fence porphyrin &#945;4 atropisomer configuration has been previously demonstrated to improve the cell internalization of the pre&#8208;clinical drug, redaporfin, applied in photodynamic therapy. In this work, the &#945;4 configuration was modelled with novel porphyrin photosensitizers through strapped moieties which effectively fixed the atropisomeric configuration. The stable cis&#8208;&#945;&#945; configuration demonstrated enhanced cell membrane permeation, effectively predicting the behavior of the &#945;4 configuration and indicates that strapped porphyrins can serve as stable model systems for the investigation of photoactive drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Julia&#8208;Kocienski Olefination: A Tutorial Review</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All you need to know about Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefination and its successful implementation in the lab. Based on recent literature the most frequently used olefination methodologies have been reviewed focusing on the key parameters beneficially influencing the reaction outcome. Typically used Julia&#8208;Kocienski reagent synthesis protocols as well as the development of modified reagents are also highlighted.







Abstract
Over the past two decades, Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefination has become one of the most powerful and reliable C=C double&#8208;bond construction methods typically furnishing E&#8208;configured alkenes. This review summarizes the scientific literature of the past decade focusing on the key aspects for successful execution of the olefination step. The main stereoselectivity and yield&#8208;determining aspects have been outlined in separate chapters providing all the necessary information for the synthesis of Julia&#8208;Kocienski reagents as well as the most commonly used reaction optimization techniques.

         <dc:description>Three new compounds, the silphiperfolanol angelate ester umutagarananol (1), the macrocyclic pyrrolizidine alkaloids umutagarinine A and B (2&#8208;3), and five known secondary metabolites (4&#8208;8) were isolated from the CH2Cl2&#8208;MeOH (1:1) extract of the roots and the stem bark of Solanecio mannii (Hook. f.) (Asteraceae). The isolated compounds were characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopic, and mass spectrometric analyses, whereas the relative stereochemistry of 5 was established by NAMFIS&#8208;based combined computational and solution NMR analysis. Synthetic modification of 4 provided two new compounds, 2&#8208;angeloyloxy&#8208;4,8&#8208;epoxypresilphiperfolane (9) and 2&#8208;angeloyloxy&#8208;4,8&#8208;epoxypresilphi&#8208;perfolane (10). The crude extracts and the isolated constituents showed weak antibacterial activities (EC50 0.7&#8208;13.3 mM) against the Gram&#8208;negative Escherichia coli and the Gram&#8208;positive Bacillus subtilis.

         <title>Bioinspired Synthesis of Pulvinic Acids Including Xerocomic Acid and Fluorescence Properties of Bis&#8208;lactone Intermediates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six pulvinic acids (pulvinic, pinastric, atromentic, xerocomic, isoxerocomic, variegatic) and a polyporic acid (atromentin) were synthesised. A set of terphenyl&#8208;quinones was prepared through sequential Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings. Then, a rearrangement into pulvinic bis&#8208;lactones was induced by the action of Ac2O/DMSO. Ring openings and deprotections achieved total syntheses. Fluorescence properties of bis&#8208;lactones were determined.







Abstract
A set of representative pulvinic acids were synthesised using a bioinspired strategy. Terphenyl&#8208;quinones (polyporic acid scaffold) were prepared via sequential Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings allowing access to unsymmetrically substituted derivatives in a one&#8208;pot protocol. Subjected to the action of acetic anhydride and DMSO, quinones were converted into bis&#8208;lactone intermediates. Methanolysis and deprotection achieved the total syntheses of the corresponding pulvinic acids. Following this general strategy, symmetrical pulvinic, atromentic, variegatic acids and unsymmetrical congener pinastric, iso&#8208;pinastric, xerocomic and iso&#8208;xerocomic acids were prepared in fair yields. Fluorescence properties were observed for the bis&#8208;lactone intermediates and, as a complement to this synthetic work, optical properties were measured, and fluorescence quantum yields were determined for the bis&#8208;lactone pigments.

&lt;p&gt;Six pulvinic acids (pulvinic, pinastric, atromentic, xerocomic, isoxerocomic, variegatic) and a polyporic acid (atromentin) were synthesised. A set of terphenyl-quinones was prepared through sequential Suzuki-Miyaura couplings. Then, a rearrangement into pulvinic bis-lactones was induced by the action of Ac&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/DMSO. Ring openings and deprotections achieved total syntheses. Fluorescence properties of bis-lactones were determined.

         <title>Lithiation&#8208;Functionalisation of Triazoles Bearing Electron&#8208;Withdrawing N&#8208;Substituents: Challenges and Solutions
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithiated 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing N&#8208;substituents are susceptible to decomposition, even at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C. In addition, lithiation of N&#8208;aryl triazoles can take place at either the triazole or the N&#8208;aryl ring. Careful control of reaction conditions is therefore required to i) minimise decomposition pathways; and ii) facilitate regioselective functionalisation of the triazole.







Abstract
The regioselective lithiation of 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles provides an opportunity to introduce additional functionality, however this simple functionalisation strategy using triazoles bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing N&#8208;substituents has not been investigated until now. Herein, we demonstrate that the lithiated triazole intermediates can readily decompose, even at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C. In addition, lithiation&#8208;deuteration studies reveal lithiation can take place competitively on both the triazole and the electron&#8208;withdrawn aryl ring. Careful control of reaction conditions is therefore required to i) minimise decomposition pathways; and ii) facilitate regioselective functionalisation of the triazole.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Functionalized 1,3&#8208;Enynes through Recyclable Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Three&#8208;Component Reaction of Terminal Alkynes, Diazoesters and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogeneous copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction of terminal alkynes, diazoesters and aldehydes proceeds smoothly under mild conditions to afford functionalized 1,3&#8208;enynes in high yields with excellent stereoselectivity. This heterogeneous copper catalyst can be easily recovered and recycled up to ten times without any significant loss of activity.







Abstract
A highly efficient heterogeneous copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling of terminal alkynes, diazoesters and aldehydes has been achieved by using 10&#8197;mol% of copper(I) iodide complex [N,N&#8208;CuI&#8208;MCM&#8208;41] anchored on 2&#8208;aminoethylamino&#8208;modified mesoporous material MCM&#8208;41 as the catalyst under mild conditions, delivering a wide variety of 2&#8208;alkoxycarbonyl&#8208;substituted (E)&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes in mostly good to high yields with excellent stereoselectivity. The heterogenized copper(I) complex can be facilely prepared from inexpensive reagents by using a simple procedure and exhibits a remarkably higher catalytic activity than CuI, and can be recycled more than ten times without a significant drop in its catalytic efficiency. This protocol represents the first example of heterogeneous copper&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective construction of functionalized 1,3&#8208;enynes from simple and commercially available starting materials.

         <title>Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Transfer Hydrogenation and Alkylation of Aldehydes and Ketones Using Ethanol as the Hydrogen Source</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ethanol is used as a hydrogen source and an alkylating agent in the Ir&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation and alkylation of ketones and aldehydes with amides as simple ligands affording alcohols in good to excellent yields. Our studies revealed the significant role of the base in achieving the TH and alkylation of carbonyl compounds with ethanol. The control experiments indicated the formation of Ir&#8722;H species and the important role of ligand in stabilizing the metal complex.







Abstract
Bio&#8208;derived ethanol is a promising green and sustainable hydrogen&#8208;donor solvent. Herein, we have developed Ir&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of ketones and aldehydes using ethanol as a hydrogen source with amides as simple ligands. Furthermore, the alkylation of ketones and tandem alkylation/transfer hydrogenation of acetophenones is reported with ethanol.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (E/Z) des&#8208;Hydroxy Triticone A and B</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of (E/Z) des&#8208;hydroxy triticone A and B was accomplished by using a chemoselective, protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free iodolactamization strategy. Baylis&#8722;Hillman type addition of DBU at the &#948;&#8208;position leads to isomerization of the double bond, which resulted into a single isomer.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of des&#8208;hydroxy triticone A and B was achieved in 12 steps. The highly chemoselective, base mediated iodolactamization of olefins with N&#8208;OMe amide motif is a key highlight of the synthesis.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arguably, the simplest way for the preparation of benzo[b]tellurophenes has been elaborated. Cyclization of o&#8208;haloarylalkynes in the presence of Te&#8208;NaOH&#8208;DMSO triad occurs by simple mixing of starting materials and heating overnight without the need for dry and inert atmosphere and provides the corresponding benzo[b]tellurophenes in up to 90% GC&#8208;yield. Catalytic telluration of aryl iodide substrates extends the applicability of the developed cyclization cascade to substrates that are not suitable for the direct SNAr/5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization approach. Successful SEAr in the third position of benzo[b]tellurophene provides a synthetic intermediate for the preparation of Te analogues of selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) raloxifene.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Post&#8208;Ugi modifications offer a great tool to construct functionalized heterocycles in an atom&#8208;economic manner. Using this approach, we have constructed highly functionalized azaspiro tricyclic scaffolds that involve Ugi condensation and ipso&#8208;cyclization followed by aza&#8208;Michael ring closures. Herein, we present a detailed account of aza&#8208;Michael cyclizations with respect to substrate scope and limitations, along with new methods to prepare novel azaspiro tricyclic scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Two previously unknown protocols for Pd&#8208;catalyzed allylic C&#8211;H sulfonylation of terminal alkenes have been developed. While the first consists of direct Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative C&#8211;H allylic sulfonylation in the presence of sulfinate anions, the second involves a sequential one&#8208;pot Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H allylic acetoxylation followed by a Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cascade dimerization of alkynones bearing sterically hindered secondary alkyl groups at the carbonyl function has unexpectedly furnished highly functionalized furans. The reaction efficiently occurs in the presence of potassium tert&#8208;butoxide/dimethylsulfoxide superbase catalytic system at room temperature. Alkynones having additional C&#8208;H active site at the carbon&#8208;carbon triple bond have followed another dimerization pathway to afford 3&#8208;alkenylpyran&#8208;4&#8208;ones.

         <title>Monoaryl&#8208;Substituted Norbornadiene Photoswitches as Molecular Solar Thermal Energy Storage Compounds: Synthesis and Investigation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One is enough: It is demonstrated that the functionalization of norbornadiene with already one substituent with increased &#960; system results in improved photochromic properties and reversible storage of light energy as chemical energy.







Abstract
In the search for improved photochromic systems that may be used for the efficient reversible conversion of light into chemical energy, eight monoaryl&#8208;substituted norbornadienes are presented, which carry naphthyl, anthracenyl, or donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;phenyl substituents to establish an extended &#960; system. The substrates were synthesized by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reactions, and their absorption properties, the key parameters of the photochromic equilibrium, and the energy storage density of the quadricyclane products were examined. It was observed that these compounds have favorable properties for chemical energy storage. Specifically, 2&#8208;(1&#8208;naphthyl)norbornadiene showed a pronounced red shift of the absorption, a long half&#8208;life (35 d) and a relatively high energy storage density (361&#8197;KJ/Kg) of the respective quadricyclane. Therefore, the so far neglected monoaryl&#8208;norbornadienes represent a useful and complementary class of compounds that should be considered in the development of efficient molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST) compounds, which can reversibly convert sunlight into chemical energy.

         <title>Natural Eutectic Solvent Mixture of l&#8208;Menthol/Malonic acid (4&#8201;:&#8201;1) and Its Ibuprofen Solution: Thermal and Physical Characterizations and NMR Studies of Molecular Interaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The type and strength of the non&#8208;covalent interactions that take place in a solution of ibuprofen in a new natural deep eutectic solvent (NADES), based on L&#8208;menthol, were investigated through NMR methods. Even in acetonitrile, a hydrogen&#8208;bonding network is formed between the components of the solvent. As a result of the cooperative effect of the constituents, a molecular complex is also formed with ibuprofen.







Abstract
A eutectic mixture of L&#8208;menthol and malonic acid, Me/MA (4&#8201;:&#8201;1), was characterized by calorimetry and other physical measurements. The new deep eutectic solvent (m.p. 6&#8201;&#176;C) solvates 338&#8197;mg of ibuprofen per mL, and the solution is stable in a wide temperature range. Strategies of NMR titration used in supramolecular chemistry were employed to explore binding forces between the eutectic constituents as well as solute&#8208;solvent interaction in ibuprofen solution. Even in acetonitrile, Me4MA is formed through a hydrogen&#8208;bonding network, where the constituents act as hydrogen donors and acceptors at the same time. The estimated association constant is around 30&#8197;M&#8722;1; the binding forces are enough to build the eutectic mixture at high concentrations. The aggregate Me4MA forms a molecular complex with ibuprofen in acetonitrile as a result of the cooperative effect of the constituents. In addition, van der Waals interactions are operative between ibuprofen and menthol in the saturated IB&#8208;Me/MA (4&#8201;:&#8201;1) solution.

         <dc:description>
This work disclosed a concise and environmental approach for the rapid alkylation of N&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinolines, providing a new route to versatile intermediates of tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives. Stable organoboron reagents have shown their ability in the photoinduced aerobic cross&#8208;coupling reactions, allowing the construction of challenging Csp3&#8722;Csp3 bond.







Abstract
We describe an efficient method for &#945;&#8208;functionalization of N&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinolines under visible&#8208;light&#8208;irradiation catalyzed by organic photocatalyst. This protocol provides a concise and environmental approach for the rapid allylation and benzylation of N&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinolines, and shows broad substrate scope. Stable organoboron reagents have shown their ability in the construction of challenging Csp3&#8722;Csp3 bond. The load of the photocatalyst is low and the oxidant is inexpensive and less toxic.

         <title>Mechanochemical Radical Boronation of Aryl Diazonium Salts Promoted by Sodium Chloride</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemically performed boronation of arene diazonium salts is presented. The key feature of this method is NaCl which significantly enhances this procedure. Mechanistic and DFT investigations suggest plausible mechanism and action of chloride ions. Chloride anions participate in the formation of more reactive diazonium chlorides as well as in B&#8722;Cl intermediates.







Abstract
Arylboronates are helpful building blocks in organic synthesis. Here, we present an efficient mechanochemical synthesis of arylboronates from arene diazonium salts. Importantly, this transformation was significantly enhanced by sodium chloride, which probably promotes the decomposition of diazonium salts via anion exchange.

     alt="Mechanochemical Radical Boronation of Aryl Diazonium Salts Promoted by Sodium Chloride"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanochemically performed boronation of arene diazonium salts is presented. The key feature of this method is NaCl which significantly enhances this procedure. Mechanistic and DFT investigations suggest plausible mechanism and action of chloride ions. Chloride anions participate in the formation of more reactive diazonium chlorides as well as in B&#8722;Cl intermediates.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Bimetallic Cooperatively Catalyzed Heteroarylation of Aryl Fluorosulfates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective method to construct heterobiaryl compounds by palladium and copper cooperatively catalyzed with excellent yields under mild conditions. Abundant functional group compatibility provides economical preparation of desired products from easily accessed aryl fluorosulfates.







Abstract
We report a bimetallic cooperatively catalyzed C&#8722;H activation strategy for the heteroarylation of easily accessed aryl fluorosulfates which were introduced to sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) click chemistry by Sharpless. This novel catalytic system enables highly chemoselective synthesis of important heterobiaryl motifs through the coupling of aryl fluorosulfates in the absence of prefunclization and directing groups. Moreover, this strategy has good functional group tolerance and a wide range of substrates and could be successfully used for the synthesis of bioactive molecules tafamidis.

         <title>Katritzky Salts for the Synthesis of Unnatural Amino Acids and Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of Peptides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the last few years, Katritzky salts emerged as a potential tool for the synthesis of unnatural amino acids, and late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides. In this review, we summarized the applications of deaminative functionalization in the peptide chemistry field, including cross&#8208;coupling, photocatalysis, &#945;&#8208;alkylation, and macrocyclization. Moreover, findings confirmed the on&#8208;resin feasibility of using Katritzky salts in solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis.







Abstract
Peptide drug discovery often benefits from the large structural diversity permitted by unnatural amino acids (UAAs). Indeed, numerous approved peptide drugs include UAAs in their sequences. Therefore, innovative chemical approaches either to synthesize UAAs or to allow late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides are emerging themes in peptide drug discovery. Thanks to the recent advances in deaminative strategies using alkylpyridiniums salts, often referred to as Katritzky salts, a variety of radical alkylation methods have been developed. In recent years the use of Katritzky salts have become popular in peptide chemistry due to their ease of preparation from a primary amine, which is a predominant functional group in amino acids. This review highlights the progress that has been made by using Katritzky salts in the synthesis of UAAs, late&#8208;stage peptide functionalization, and peptide macrocyclization.

A diastereoselective synthesis of highly substituted isoindolo[2,1&#8208;a]quinolin&#8208;11(5H)&#8208;ones containing three continuous stereocenters is reported. The reaction is based on a Povarov&#8208;like reaction between enamide and a N&#8208;aryl&#8208;acylimines, affording the fused heterocyclic products in high yields and diastereoselectivities.







Abstract
A stereoselective synthesis of isoindolo[2,1&#8208;a]quinolin&#8208;11(5H)&#8208;ones containing three contiguous stereogenic centers is described. This Lewis&#8208;acid mediated reaction of enamides with N&#8208;aryl&#8208;acylimines affords the desired fused heterocyclic isoindolinones in high yields and diastereoselectivities. Scope and limitations of this method are discussed. The stereochemical outcome of this transformation indicates a stepwise reaction pathway.

         <dc:description>
In this work, an efficient method for the synthesis of cyclopentyl 1,2&#8208;diphosphines from malonates and diphosphinyldienes is reported. The asymmetric version was also accomplished in the presence of a chiral auxiliary. The product can be easily converted into a corresponding transition metal complex, which may be widely used in asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
A base&#8208;promoted tandem Michael addition of malonates to 2,3&#8208; bis(diarylphosphinyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadienes was developed for the synthesis of cyclopentyl 1,2&#8208;bisphosphine compounds. This method enables rapid construction of various 1,2&#8208;bis(diarylphosphinyl)cyclopentanes, and features readily accessible reactants, mild conditions and good functional group tolerance. The product could be easily transformed to the corresponding transition metal complexes, which may find broad applications in asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Azulene&#8208;Indole Fused Polycyclic Heteroaromatics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three azulene&#8208;indole fused polycyclic heteroaromatics (PHAs), AzIn&#8208;1, AzIn&#8208;2 and DGAzIn, have been designed and synthesized. These PHAs exhibit narrow optical band gaps, anti&#8208;Kasha emission and reversible stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. Furthermore, these straightforward and simple synthetic routes would provide a new entry for constructing novel azulene&#8208;embedded &#960;&#8208;conjugates, especially for the seven&#8208;membered ring of azulene unit, wherein the regioselective transformation is not well developed.







Abstract
Linear polycyclic systems are promising candidates in the area of organic electronics. Herein, we present the syntheses of three azulene&#8208;indole (AzIn) fused polycyclic heteroaromatics (PHAs), AzIn&#8208;1, AzIn&#8208;2 and DGAzIn, which have nitrogens and nonhexagonal rings simultaneously. The chemical structures, optical and electrochemical properties of three AzIn&#8208;based PHAs have been investigated, as well as their protonation behaviors with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). All three AzIn&#8208;based PHAs exhibit narrow optical band gaps with moderate to good air stability, anti&#8208;Kasha emission and reversible stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. Furthermore, these straightforward and simple synthetic routes would provide a new entry for constructing novel azulene&#8208;embedded &#960;&#8208;conjugates, especially for the seven&#8208;membered ring of azulene unit, wherein the regioselective transformation is not well developed.

         <title>1,3&#8208;Sulfinate Migration Triggered by &#945;&#8208;Imino Carbene and Divergent Zwitterion Cyclization: Synthesis of Cyclopropane, Dihydropyrrole and Azepane Ring Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopropane, dihydropyrrole and azepane ring systems were synthesized conveniently from sulfinate&#8208;tethered triazoles. The divergent synthetic strategy started with the unique 1,3&#8208;sulfinate migration of an &#945;&#8208;imino carbene. The efficient reaction allowed control of the zwitterion bearing multiple reactive sites depending on the increased stability of the resulting carbocation and anion. The sulfinate was converted to a sulfone after the group migration, and a stable anion bearing two electron&#8208;withdrawing groups was thus formed. Catalytic amount of iodide acted as a switch for the synthesis of cyclopropanes and dihydropyrroles. The reaction merits including readily available substrates, mild reaction conditions and excellent functional group compatibility qualified this protocol a possible synthetic tool for cyclic compounds, especially N&#8208;heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot strategy to access indoloindoles with wide scope and good functional group tolerance from diaryliodonium salts is described.







Abstract
One&#8208;pot synthesis of various indolo[2,3&#8208;b]indoles has been accomplished from a copper&#8208;catalyzed transformation of easily accessible 2&#8208;(substituted&#8208;amino)aryl)(mesityl)iodonium salts and indole derivatives. Reaction offers great functional group toleration, providing a series of indolo[2,3&#8208;b]indole derivatives in good yields. Additionally, intramolecular cyclization of 2&#8208;(substituted&#8208;amino)aryl)(mesityl)iodonium salts in the presence of copper&#8208;catalyst provided direct access to benzoxazole derivatives.

         <title>Organophosphites: An Addition to the Arsenal of Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of organophosphite catalysis is introduced in the context of nucleophilic organocatalysis. Its unique characteristics were compared with other known nucleophile catalysts to describe new and complimentary reactions. In this review, we evaluate the reactivity pattern to provide our views on challenges, advantages, and potential applications of phosphite catalyst.







Abstract
Organophosphites are nucleophilic in nature and can act as a good leaving group owing to the stability of the phosphite anion. This dual reactivity makes them good candidates for nucleophilic organocatalysis. However, phosphites were introduced only in 2004 as the umpolung catalyst for acylsilane substrates utilizing sequential Brook rearrangements. Very recently, phosphites have been reported to catalyze aza&#8208;rearrangements and radical reactions. In this review, we discuss the reactivity parameters to understand its lack of use, as well as the potential for catalysis.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereocontrolled TMSOTf&#8208;ring opening of 1,6&#8208;anhydrosugars with TMSCN leading to glycosyl cyanides is presented as well as an application to the straightforward synthesis of a conformationally&#8208;constrained analogue of 1&#8208;cyano D&#8208;glucal.







Abstract
We describe herein a convenient access to glycosyl cyanides by way of TMSCN ring opening of 1,6&#8208;anhydro sugars mediated by TMSOTf with modest to high stereocontrol in the D&#8208;gluco, D&#8208;galacto and D&#8208;manno series. The reaction is tolerant to various functional groups including free alcohols, alkenes and terminal alkynes. The straightforward synthesis of a constrained analogue of 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;D&#8208;glucal with a 3,6&#8208;anhydro sugar framework is presented to illustrate the interest of the TMSCN ring&#8208;opening reaction.

         <dc:description>Attempts to improve the organocatalytic Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of vinylboronic compounds are described. Further experiments, theoretical calculations and NMR studies were performed to optimize the existing procedure and analyze the reactivity of the reactive intermediate and the ligand&#8208;exchange process. In particular, the relationship between the structure and the performance of the organocatalysts was studied theoretically and experimentally. Although the catalytic activity of the &#945;&#8208;hydroxyacids could not be improved much, a deeper insight has been gained, which might be useful for the development of other organocatalytic reactions of organoboron compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Carpet beater molecules: synthesis and characterization of functional of hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;benzocoronene&#8208;alkyne coupling products</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Within the scope of this paper nine p&#8208;expanded mono&#8208;substituted 5,8,11,14,17&#8208;pentakis&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzo&#8208;coronenes (HBC) are introduced. 2&#8208;Iodo&#8208;5,8,11,14,17&#8208;pentakis&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene served as precursor and was reacted with ethynyltrimethylsilane in a Sonogashira coupling reaction. The acetylene unit is used as a linker and can undergo another Sonogashira coupling reaction combining different phenyl coupling partners with the HBC core. The electron&#8208;withdrawing groups such as nitrile, pyridine and carbonyl species (aldehyde, methylester, carbonic acid) as well as the three quinoxaline based species (diphenylquinoxaline, dibenzop[a,c]phenazine, phenanthrol[4&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;a,b,c]phenazine) serve as substitution moieties. Their influence on the optoelectronic properties were investigated via UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy demonstrating a maximum redshift of 7 nm compared to starting compound HBC&#8208;I. As for the phenanthrol[4&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;a,b,c]phenazine substituted HBC a dramatic decrease in the intensity of the absorption of the UV/Vis spectrum was observed. The fluorescence spectroscopy pointed out that the dibenzo[a,c]phenazine and phenanthrol[4&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;a,b,c]phenazine substitution changed the spectra to one broad peak departing from the characteristic HBC&#8208;like emission pattern.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metal and light&#8208;free Minisci&#8208;type acylation approach of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline amides with general primary alcohols was demonstrated under tBu4NCl/K2S2O8 system. Simultaneously, the C2&#8208;H alkylation can be realized by accident for special benzyl alcohols bearing strong electron&#8208;donating groups. Most N&#8208;heterocycles were also compatible to afford corresponding acylated products. Furthermore, The mechanism investigation reveals that chlorine radical induced the original ketyl radical generation through abstracting the &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H from the alcohols, then underwent nucleophilic carbon&#8208;centered radicals addition, deprotonation and oxidation to provide the target acylation products.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyzed Synthesis of 3&#8208;Substituted Phthalides: A Key Access to (&#177;)&#8208;Herbaric Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we investigated a new organophotocatalyzed protocol enabling the preparation of 3&#8208;substituted phthalides. From this work, the 1,2,3,5&#8208;Tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN) turned out to be a particularly efficient organophotocatalyst to promote lactone formation under visible&#8208;light irradiation within 6&#8197;h. Ultimately, it was found that this protocol could enable the formation of racemic herbaric acid.







Abstract
An efficient organophotocatalyzed protocol was developed for the preparation of 3&#8208;substituted phthalides. The presented transformation was performed under particularly mild conditions within 6&#8197;h and was ultimately applied to a precursor of the herbaric acid.

         <title>Combining Matteson Homologations and Claisen Rearrangements &#8211; An Efficient Protocol for Amino Acid Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Matteson homologation with vinyl nucleophiles can be combined with the zinc&#8208;chelated ester enolate Claisen rearrangement to obtain highly functionalized unusual amino acids. The substitution pattern of the side chain can be determined by variation of the nucleophiles used in the homologation steps.







Abstract
The Matteson homologation with vinyl nucleophiles was found to be an efficient and versatile protocol for the synthesis of substituted chiral allyl alcohols in a highly stereoselective fashion. These alcohols can be coupled with N&#8208;protected glycine and subsequently subjected to zinc&#8208;chelated ester&#8208;enolate Claisen rearrangements to yield highly substituted unsaturated amino acids. By varying the nucleophiles used in the Matteson homologations, the method allows control over not only the stereogenic centers but also the side&#8208;chain substitution pattern in the newly formed &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated amino acids.

</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a new ynamide scaffold has been designed, synthesized and later applied in a gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization reaction to access pyrrole containing &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones in low&#8208;to&#8208;moderate yields. Interestingly, the trans product has been obtained as a major isomer.







Abstract
Substituted pyrroles are prevalent aromatic ring systems encountered in numerous natural products and bioactive molecules. Herein, a novel ynamide scaffold has been designed, synthesized and subsequently applied to an unprecedented gold&#8208;catalyzed and para&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA)&#8208;assisted cascade cycloisomerization reaction for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;pyrrole substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. Notably, the reaction is stereoselective, offering E&#8208;isomer as major product with low to moderate yield.

         <dc:description>The ring&#8208;opening addition reaction of activated vinyl cyclopropanes with  N  &#8208;tosylhydrazones in the presence of palladium(0) and triphenylphosphine to give  N  &#8208;tosylhydrazone butenylmalonate compounds is described herein. Aromatic aldehyde&#8208;derived  N  &#8208;tosylhydrazones produced terminal and internal  N  &#8208;allylated products, in which the terminal products are the main. While ketone&#8208;derived tosylhydrazones produced only terminal addition products. The transformation relationship of the terminal and internal  N  &#8208;allylated products in the reaction was also observed.

         <title>Rapid Access to Substituted Indenones via Grignard Reaction and its Application in the Synthesis of Fluorenones using Ring Closing Metathesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient, one&#8208;step method has been used to access a variety of substituted indenones in a regiospecific manner by Grignard addition to indene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione. This method provides straightforward access to natural products such as neo&#8208;lignans and isoampelopsin D analogues. Moreover, diallyl indenones have been synthesized and employed as ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) precursors for the facile synthesis of substituted fluorenone derivatives via an RCM&#8208;aromatization sequence.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Catalyzed&#160;Hydroxyl&#8208;Yne Click Reaction: A Powerful Tool toward Red&#8208;Emitting Nontraditional Small Organic Luminogens</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nontraditional small organic luminogens (NTSOLs) without classic conjugated chromophores have attracted significant attention. However, the design and synthesis of NTSOLs with fluorescence in the red region remain significantly challenging. In this study, we established a self&#8208;catalyzed hydroxyl&#8208;yne click reaction for preparing long&#8208;wavelength and red&#8208;emitting NTSOLs. Owing to their perfect reaction selectivity, high efficiency, and excellent universality, a series of compounds with well&#8208;defined structures were obtained in high yields. Moreover, the obtained compounds showed concentration&#8208;enhanced and excitation&#8208;dependent emission characteristics. The compounds also exhibited dramatical chemical structure&#8208;dependent and aggregation&#8208;induced red&#8208;shifted fluorescence properties, based on which we successfully obtained red&#8208;emitting NTSOLs by simply adjusting chemical structure and concentration. Most importantly, the compounds show good cell staining ability, which can be used in cell imaging. Thus, this study provides a facile strategy for the synthesis of red&#8208;emitting NTSOLs and expands the methodology library of both self&#8208;catalyzed click reactions and nontraditional luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In the last decades, various efforts have been made to synthesize optimal glycotripods for targeting trimeric glycoproteins like asialoglycoprotein receptor, hemagglutinin, and langerin. All these trimeric glycoproteins have sugar binding pockets which are highly selective for a particular carbohydrate ligand. Optimized glycotripods are high affinity binders and have been used for delivering drugs or even applied as drug candidates. The selection of the tripodal base scaffold together with the length and flexibility of the linker between the scaffold and sugar residue, as important design parameters are discussed in this review.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Bis(naphthofuran)&#8208;Fused [7]Helicene Derivatives</title>

Late&#8208;stage cyclization of the McMurry dimerized product furnished oxa[7]helicene with functional group tunability.







Abstract
Novel benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,3&#8208;b&#8242;]dinaphthofuran (oxa[7]helicene) with various substituents in the central ring were designed and successfully synthesized based on the late stage central ring formation strategy from naphthofuranoneby using an efficient McMurry coupling or Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation. The photochemical properties of helicenes were evaluated by UV&#8208;Visible absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy, while electrochemical behaviour including their energy profile were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and DFT calculations. According to the computational study, substituents on the central ring could influence both electron delocalization and MO distribution of oxa[7]helicenes resulting in the change in charge transporting ability. In comparison to the parent carbo[7]helicene, the furan unit in conjunction with substituents on helical system caused the bathochromic shift with different absorption pattern and exhibited higher fluorescence quantum yield (&#981;f up to 0.63). These new materials showed promising characteristics in optoelectronic application.

This work reports the visible light mediated oxidative coupling of aryl methyl amines with o&#8208;phenylenediamine, 2&#8208;aminobenzenethiol and 2&#8208;aminobenzamide to benzimidazoles, benzothiazoles, and quinazolinones in one pot using scalable and reusable heterogeneous Ba&#8208;doped CoMoO4 nanoparticles under air atmosphere.







Abstract
Herein we report a simple and efficient oxidative coupling of various aryl methyl amines with diverse coupling partners, such as o&#8208;phenylenediamine (benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine), 2&#8208;aminobenzenethiol and 2&#8208;aminobenzamide, to synthesize the corresponding heterocycles using scalable and reusable heterogeneous catalysts under visible light irradiation. A systematic investigation led to the synthesis of benzimidazoles, benzothiazoles and quinazolinones under air atmosphere in very good to excellent yields. The strategy is atom economical and found to be tolerance towards different functional groups, and wide range of substrate scope. Furthermore, the methodology was demonstrated for its suitability on scale up and reusability. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the analysis of band structures of pristine and Ba doped CoMoO4 systems showed that the doping of Ba in place of Co improved the catalytic performance of the system.

Abstract
An efficient approach to (2R,3S)&#8208;3&#8208;siloxy&#8208;2&#8208;phenylethynyl substituted pyrrolidines was developed through Y(OTf)3&#8208;CuI catalyzed N&#8208;&#945; alkynylation of cyclic imines (1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;e) with alkynes 2&#8201;a&#8211;s. As a result, a number of trans&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl acetylene substituted&#8208;3&#8208;siloxy pyrrolidine derivatives 4&#8201;aa&#8211;as, 4&#8201;ea&#8211;ef and 4&#8201;es were synthesized in moderate to good yields with excellent diastereoselectivities (dr up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1).

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Electrochemical Synthesis of (Hetero)Aryl Trifluoromethyl Selenides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes an electrochemical nickel&#8208;catalyzed reaction of trifluoromethylselenolation of various aryl iodides, catalytic in electron, and using [Me4N]+[SeCF3]&#8722; as reagent. A Ni(0)&#8208;based catalytic cycle was proposed on the basis on electrochemical investigations.







Abstract
A convenient and efficient approach for the construction of aryl trifluoromethyl selenoethers from aryl iodides under mild conditions is reported. Electrochemical activation of stable and inexpensive NiBr2bipy (bipy &#8211; bipyridine) complex instead of labile Ni(COD)2 (COD &#8211; cyclooctadiene) catalyst. [NMe4][SeCF3] is employed as shelf&#8208;stable source of SeCF3 fragment. The reaction tolerates a wide range of substrates, including modification of drug&#8208;like molecules. Cyclic voltammetry studies allow insight into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Highly Conjugated Bis(benzo[b]phosphole)&#8208;P&#8208;oxides: Synthesis and Electrochemical, Optical, and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of the two diastereoisomers cis&#8208;(E)&#8208;1 and trans&#8208;(E)&#8208;1 (the chiral and meso one respectively) containing two stereogenic P atoms has been accomplished in three different ways. This highly conjugated bis&#8208;(benzo[b]phosphole) P&#8208;oxide has been characterized by means of electrochemical and photophysical studies and the relative configuration of the two diastereoisomers assigned through CV and NMR studies.







Abstract
The first examples of a &#960;&#8208;conjugated benzo[b]phosphole P&#8208;oxide in which two phosphole P&#8208;oxide units are connected by a carbon&#8208;carbon double bond are described. The molecules are synthesized as E isomers with respect to the carbon&#8208;carbon double bond and exist as stable cis and trans isomers (chiral and meso one respectively) relatively to the two stereogenic P atoms. The optical and electrochemical properties of both isomers have been investigated by experiment and computations.

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;Arylpyrimido[4,5&#8208;b]porphyrins via Cyclization Reaction with Ammonia</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, a new series of &#946;,&#946;&#8217;&#8208;fused 2&#8208;arylpyrimido[4,5&#8208;b]porphyrins were synthesized through an ammonia assimilated condensation cyclization of 2&#8208;aroylamino&#8208;3&#8208;formylporphyrins in DMSO at 50&#8201;&#176;C. The preliminary photophysical studies revealed a significant bathochromic shift in electronic absorption and emission spectra of these porphyrinoids as compared to meso&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)porphyrins due to the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation.







Abstract
A facile synthetic strategy for the synthesis of a new series of &#946;,&#946;&#8217;&#8208;fused 2&#8208;arylpyrimido[4,5&#8208;b]porphyrins has been developed by using condensation cyclization reaction with ammonia. 2&#8208;Aroylamino&#8208;3&#8208;formylporphyrins were synthesized from 2&#8208;aroylaminoporphyrins under Vilsmeier&#8211;Haack reaction conditions, which were then efficiently converted to the corresponding 2&#8208;arylpyrimido[4,5&#8208;b]&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)&#8208;porphyrins via a condensation cyclization reaction. The nickel(II), copper(II), free&#8208;base and zinc(II) analogues of 2&#8208;arylpyrimido[4,5&#8208;b]porphyrins were successfully synthesized in 65&#8211;72&#8201;% yields and structurally characterized on the basis of spectral data analysis. On photophysical evaluation, 2&#8208;arylpyrimido[4,5&#8208;b]porphyrins demonstrated a 12&#8211;19&#8197;nm bathochromic shift in their electronic absorption spectra and up to 10&#8197;nm red shift in their emission spectra as compared to the simple meso&#8208;(tetrakis(4&#8208;chlorophenyl))porphyrins due to the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation.

         <title>A Fujiwara&#8211;Moritani&#8208;Type Alkenylation Using a Traceless Directing Group Strategy: A Rare Example of C&#8208;C Bond Formation towards the C2&#8208;Carbon of Terminal Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report, a rhodium catalyzed Fujiwara&#8208;Moritani&#8208;type reaction of unactivated terminal alkenes and benzoic acid derivatives bearing electron donating residues under mild conditions. The acid functionality acts as a traceless directing group delivering products alkenylated in meta&#8208;position to the electron donating substituent in contrast to the usually obtained ortho and para substitution in Friedel&#8208;Crafts type reactions. Remarkably, the new C&#8208;C bond is formed to the C2 of the terminal olefin, in contrast to similar reported transformations. Initially formed mixtures of exo&#8208; and endo&#8208;double bond isomers can be efficiently isomerized to the more stable endo&#8208;products.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Studies on the Bidentate Lewis Acid Catalyzed Domino Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8208;Alder/Thiol Transfer Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective multicomponent reaction (MCR) of phthalazines, aldehydes and thiophenols provides access to thioether&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes. To illuminate its mechanism, control experiments, NMR studies and DFT computations were conducted. In particular the arrangement of the diene and dienophile in the IEDDA step was investigated, as it determines the enantioselectivity of this method.







Abstract
Recently, we presented a novel enantioselective multicomponent reaction of phthalazines, aldehydes and thiols accessing thioether&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes. Herein, a comprehensive investigation on the mechanism of this domino inverse electron&#8208;demand (IEDDA)/thiol transfer reaction is disclosed. In particular, the origin of the stereochemical outcome has been rationalized, as well as structural requirement of the thiol component for an efficient transfer step. Detailed NMR spectroscopy studies uncover a competing reaction pathway resulting in N,S&#8208;acetals. In addition, DFT computations illuminate the mechanism of the group transfer process and enable an explanation for the formation of the most dominant by&#8208;product. The insights allow a direct prediction of suitable substrates for the reaction and provide the basis for further developments of novel stereoselective domino reactions.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Mediated Sulfur Extrusion of Disulfides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sulfur extrusion from organic disulfides is a highly useful reaction recognised for the first time over 40 years ago. Unfortunately, it is mainly performed by aminophosphines, such as hexamethylphosphorus triamide, which is known to be very carcinogenic. This is limiting the application of the extrusion reaction especially for the synthesis of pharmaceutical products. We have developed a new method, using N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), generated from the corresponding stable imidazolium salts in combination with a base to transform a broad scope of benzylic disulfides to thioethers. In addition disulfide containing esters as well as cystine undergo this reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantifying Vertical Resonance Energy in Aromatic Systems with Natural Bond Orbitals</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural bond orbitals (NBOs) provide the familiar Lewis type (2c&#8208;2e  &#8208;  ) localized description of a molecule. Interactions between nearly filled (2e  &#8208;  ) orbitals and empty (&#960;* or &#963;*) anti&#8208;bonding orbitals represent delocalization in the system and creates a framework to study stereoelectronic interactions. Here we show that  deleting  the interactions (NBODel) between &#960; and &#960;* orbitals in aromatic systems and acquiring the energy with the NBO program provides a highly intuitive and quantitative picture of &#960;&#8208;aromaticity that correlates with the well&#8208;established nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift (NICS) method. This natural bond orbital resonance energy (NBO&#8208;RE) measures the vertical resonance energy (VRE) of aromatic systems without the use of an external reference structure. The NBO&#8208;RE method is applicable to the study of local aromaticity in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other non&#8208;planar systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;&#960; Interaction for Molecular Recognition of Anions: Focus on Cooperativity with Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen bonding and anion&#8208;&#960; interactions: two interactions of today's research in anion recognition supramolecular chemistry. The combination of these two interactions gives rise to interesting cooperativity effects that remain difficult to rationalize and quantify. In this Review, concepts of cooperativity are illustrated by reporting examples of combination of hydrogen bonding and anion&#8208;&#960; interaction.







Abstract
Anion recognition represents an active area of research in supramolecular chemistry. The last two decades have been marked by spectacular advances in the design of new anion receptors. Moreover, the development of approaches combining experimental and theoretical studies has proved to be particularly relevant, allowing for a better understanding and rationalization of the phenomena involved in anion complexation processes. In this context, the combination of weak interactions within the same receptor and their synergistic effects, called cooperativity, has attracted increasing interest within the scientific community. This Review focuses on the combination of anion&#8208;&#960; and hydrogen bonds and the emerging concept of cooperativity. The most relevant anion&#8208;&#960; donor families are presented. The concept of cooperativity is illustrated using the most recent examples present in current literature.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Chemistry for Synthesis and Co&#8208;conformational Control of Mechanically Interlocked Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient synthesis of mechanical bonds is a huge challenge. Dynamic covalent chemistry is one of the most efficient methods for forming rotaxanes, catenanes and molecular knots in high yields. This Review reports recent uses of reversible covalent bonds to synthesize mechanically interlocked molecules, and discusses how dynamic bonds can be used to control motion in interlocked molecular machinery.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules have found extensive applications in areas all across the physical sciences, from materials to catalysis and sensing. However, introducing mechanical bonds and entanglements at the molecular level is still a significant challenge due to the inherent restriction in entropy needed to preorganize strands before interlocking. Over the last decade, dynamic covalent chemistry has emerged as one of the most efficient methods of forming rotaxanes, catenanes and molecular knots. By using reversible bonds such as imines, disulfides and boronate esters, one can use the inherent error&#8208;correction in these linkages to form interlocked architectures with high fidelity and often in excellent yields. This review reports on recent advances in the use of dynamic covalent chemistry to make mechanically interlocked molecules, systematically surveying clipping, capping and templating approaches with dynamic bonds. Furthermore, it is also discussed how dynamic bonds can be used to control motion, co&#8208;conformational expression and catalytic activity in mechanically interlocked molecular machinery.

         <title>Amphiphilic Iminosugar Pharmacological Chaperones towards &#946;&#8208;Glucocerebrosidase: Self&#8208;Assembly and Biological Activity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pharmacological chaperones (PCs) are new therapeutics for protein misfolding diseases, and amphiphilic PCs perform best in Gaucher Disease patients&#8217; cell lines. With the aim of investigating the biological activity vs aggregation behaviour of a new N&#8208;alkylated iminosugar&#8208;based PC, a complete physicochemical study in solution and in the solid state was performed, which ruled out a self&#8208;assembly based multivalent effect.







Abstract
Pharmacological chaperones (PCs) can restore correct enzymatic activity at sub&#8208;inhibitory concentrations and are considered an emerging therapy for Gaucher Disease (GD). Amphiphilic PCs show more favourable cross&#8208;membrane properties and have a higher activity on cells than hydrophilic PCs. To investigate whether the biological activity of amphiphilic iminosugars is related to their state as monomers or as micellar aggregates, we synthesized some novel N&#8208;alkylated iminosugars and performed physico&#8208;chemical characterizations in the solid state and in aqueous dispersion of the best compound in terms of biological activity. The results suggest that the C12 N&#8208;alkylated iminosugar 10 exerts its biological activity in the monomeric state, and that the low cell viability observed in the presence of a 50&#8197;&#956;M concentration of compound 10 is not related to the formation of micellar aggregates in solution.

         <dc:description>Tweezer&#8208;type receptors that form p&#8208;p stacked supramolecular complexes are important components in functional polymers and molecular machines. Herein, we study how varying specific structural components of tweezer&#8208;receptors impacts their binding. A library of tweezer receptors, each containing two p&#8208;electron poor receptor residues and differing by the nature of the linking unit which was either a flexible 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylamine) residue or a rigid&#160;3,3&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;diamino&#8208;m&#8208;terphenyl diamine structure, were synthesised. Each tweezer formed 1:1 supramolecular complexes with p&#8208;electron rich residues (1,5&#8208;dihydroxynapthalene and pyrene) as confirmed by UV/Vis and&#160;1H NMR spectroscopic studies. Binding constants were determined to be between 2.3x10&#8208;5&#160;and 71 M&#8208;1&#160;in organic solvents and were one magnitude greater in aqueous solvents for water soluble systems. The nature of the linker had variable effects on the binding constants, showing the design of tweezer type supramolecular receptors with targeted&#160;Ka&#160;values is non&#8208;trivial and requires structural optimisation supported by binding constant determination studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Homocoupling of 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;N&#8208;heterocycles and Application to the Synthesis of Phenylpyridine Borane Dimers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a regioselective cross&#8208;dehydrogenative homocoupling reaction using a heterogeneous Ru catalyst and iron trichloride as oxidant to gain access to various 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic dimers. Several homocoupling products obtained were then used to synthesize a series of pyridine&#8208;borane complexes and the impact of the dimerization on their photophysical properties was studied and rationalized by using theoretical calculations.







Abstract
A method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic dimers via a cross&#8208;dehydrogenative homocoupling (homo&#8208;CDC) has been developed using commercially available Ruthenium on charcoal as catalyst and iron trichloride as oxidant. A large variety of heterocyclic scaffolds and functional groups are tolerated and a complete regioselectivity resulting from the activation of the less sterically hindered C&#8722;H bonds was observed for meta&#8208;substituted substrates. Starting from several homocoupling products obtained, a series of pyridine&#8208;borane complexes was synthesized and the impact of the dimerization on their photophysical properties was studied and rationalized using theoretical calculations.

         <title>Deoxygenative Intramolecular Minisci&#8208;Type Reaction to Access Fused Heterocyclic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid build of molecular complexity is a key for the development of novel bioactive molecules. Herein we present a three&#8208;step synthetic sequence to access fused heterocyclic scaffolds from readily available starting materials, such as halogenated heteroarenes and 1,3&#8208;diols. The key step of the strategy is the development of a deoxygenative intramolecular Minisci&#8208;type reaction.







Abstract
Herein, we present a straightforward strategy for the synthesis of fused heterocycles through a deoxygenative, intramolecular Minisci&#8208;type reaction. This approach grants access to complex polycyclic scaffolds in three steps from readily available starting materials, such as chlorinated heteroarenes and 1,3&#8208;diols. The use of saccharide derivatives as the starting 1,3&#8208;diol motif allows for the synthesis of novel heterocyclic scaffolds with excellent diastereoselectivity and formal retention of configuration at the newly formed C&#8722;C bond.

         <title>In Situ Generated DBU&#8901;HF Acts as a Fluorinating Agent in a Hexafluoroisobutylation Tandem Reaction: An Effective Route to 5,5,5,5&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;Hexafluoroleucine</title>

A stereoselective synthesis of both (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;5,5,5,5&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;hexafluoroleucine mediated by DBU through a cascade reaction is reported. The pivotal role of the organic base to preserve the nucleophilicity of the fluoride released during the process is shown. The direct incorporation of the hexafluorinated side chain allows for the facile preparation of the free and suitably protected fluorinated amino acids on a multidecagram scale.







Abstract
We report the direct incorporation of the hexafluoroisobutyl group on a chiral glycine Schiff base complex mediated by 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene (DBU). The fluoroalkylation involves 2&#8208;(bromomethyl)&#8208;1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoropropane reagent, which generates in&#8197;situ hexafluoroisobutylene (HFIB), and reacts then with the enolate through a tandem allylic shift/hydrofluorination process. We showed that the use of neutral organic base DBU generates in&#8197;situ an original DBU&#8901;HF salt, which preserves the fluoride nucleophilicity and acts as a fluorinating agent. This fluoride salt promotes the hydrofluorination of the pentafluorinated alkene overcoming the usual fluoride &#946;&#8208;elimination observed with &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;vinyl reagents. With alkali metal bases, by contrast, the hydrofluorination is disfavored and the pentafluorinated alkene intermediate is obtained predominantly. This study highlights the critical role of the fluoride counter ion to preserve its nucleophilicity. The protocol is amenable to multidecagram scale synthesis of enantiopure (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;5,5,5,5&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;hexafluoroleucine and their N&#8208;Fmoc or N&#8208;Boc derivatives in good overall yield.

         <title>First Total Synthesis of the Benzotropolone/Bis(pulvinone) Natural Product Aurantricholone Exploiting New Strategies for Establishing Benzotropolones and Z&#8208;Configured Pulvinones</title>

         <dc:description>Aurantricholone as well as its calcium and lithium salts, all of which represent the coloring principle of the fungus Tricholoma aurantium, were synthesized for the first time, namely in 15 steps, 10 of which were our longest linear sequence. We developed an access to benzotropolones after dibromocyclopropanating alkyl or silyl enol ethers of 1&#8208;tetralones. Successive treatments with DMAP&#8208;N&#8208;oxide and Ac2O effected ring&#8208;enlargement, oxidation, and acetylation. O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;1&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,4&#8208;dimethoxybenzotropolone obtained there&#173;by &#8208; similarly as unsubstituted benzotropolone &#8208; was bromin&#173;ated at C&#8208;8 in two steps by adopting our recently published bro&#173;mination protocol for otherwise unsubstituted O&#8208;acetylbenzotropolone. Thereafter, a double and doubly Z&#8208;selective Suzuki&#8208;coupling with a newly introduced boronate es&#173;tablished the O&#8208;methylated pulvinone moiety as well as the O&#8208;meth&#173;ylated &#8220;pulvinone&#8208;like&#8221; motif of what altogether equalled the completed aurantricholone scaffold. Its deprotection (two steps) furnished the title compound either as its protonated form or its calcium or lithium salt.</dc:description>

Light as air: A straightforward metal&#8208;free four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy to access new high&#8208;value functionalized phthalazines was developed. Combining a facile light&#8208;mediated enolization of o&#8208;methyl benzophenones/Diels&#8208;Alder reaction domino process with a subsequent deprotection/aromatization domino reaction leads to waste&#8208;reducing and cost&#8208;effective synthesis of new antiviral model drugs.







Abstract
We report the development of a metal&#8208;free four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy to access high&#8208;value functionalized phthalazines using o&#8208;methyl benzophenones as starting compounds. Combining a light&#8208;mediated enolization of o&#8208;methyl benzophenones/Diels&#8208;Alder reaction domino process with a subsequent deprotection/aromatization domino reaction in one&#8208;pot leads to sustainable and efficient organic synthesis. The tangible advantages, i.&#8201;e., absence of catalysts or additives, utilization of commercially available and/or easily accessible substrates, mild reaction conditions, simplicity, and single work&#8208;up procedure, make this combined process highly appealing for the direct construction of various 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;phthalazines. Importantly, in&#8197;vitro bioactivity evaluation of these newly prepared heterocyclic compounds demonstrated a strong antiviral efficacy against major human pathogens like HCMV and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

&lt;p&gt;Light as air: A straightforward metal-free four-step one-pot synthetic strategy to access new high-value functionalized phthalazines was developed. Combining a facile light-mediated enolization of o-methyl benzophenones/Diels-Alder reaction domino process with a subsequent deprotection/aromatization domino reaction leads to waste-reducing and cost-effective synthesis of new antiviral model drugs.

&lt;p&gt;We report the development of a metal-free four-step one-pot synthetic strategy to access high-value functionalized phthalazines using o-methyl benzophenones as starting compounds. Combining a light-mediated enolization of o-methyl benzophenones/Diels-Alder reaction domino process with a subsequent deprotection/aromatization domino reaction in one-pot leads to sustainable and efficient organic synthesis. The tangible advantages, i.&#8201;e., absence of catalysts or additives, utilization of commercially available and/or easily accessible substrates, mild reaction conditions, simplicity, and single work-up procedure, make this combined process highly appealing for the direct construction of various 1-aryl-phthalazines. Importantly, &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; bioactivity evaluation of these newly prepared heterocyclic compounds demonstrated a strong antiviral efficacy against major human pathogens like HCMV and SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Development and Synthesis of Carbohydrate&#8208;Based Molecules with Promising Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the potential of carbohydrates as starting materials for the synthesis of antimicrobial agents is explored. The most recent and successful reports of sugar&#8208;based bactericides, bacteriostatic agents, and adhesin binders are covered with focus on the methodologies employed in their synthesis, resulting in a useful compilation of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reactions used in carbohydrate modification.







Abstract
With the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), innovation in antibacterial drug research and development is urgently needed and strongly encouraged by the World Health Organization (WHO). Carbohydrates are valuable bioactive scaffolds to be explored in this context, and because of their unique multifunctionality, stereochemical diversity, and natural protein&#8208;binding profile, they come across as attractive starting materials for the synthesis of antimicrobial agents with innovative mechanisms of action (MoA). In this concise review, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methodologies for the synthesis of an array of promising and recently developed carbohydrate&#8208;based molecules with antibacterial activity are presented and discussed. By describing successful case studies as platforms for the scrutiny of carbohydrate modification and coupling approaches in organic chemistry, this work summarizes the latest research efforts in this area, ultimately encouraging the design and synthesis of new and much&#8208;needed glycoantibiotic leads for pharmaceutical development.

         <title>Electrochemical Bromination of Substituted Thiophenes in Batch and Continuous&#8208;Flow</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electrochemical bromination of thiophenes from ammonium bromide is developed both in batch and continuous&#8208;flow conditions. Substituted thiophenes possessing 2&#8208;hydrogens selectively afford a series of 2&#8208;bromothiophenes while 2&#8208;substituted benzothiophenes generate 3&#8208;bromobenzo[b]thiophenes. Based on the cyclic voltammetric studies and literature, a bromine cation involved mechanism was proposed.</dc:description>
