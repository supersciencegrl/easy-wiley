         <title>A New Methodology for Preparing Benzylated Aminopyridines Yields Previously Inaccessible Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnBr2&#8208;induced benzylation of 4&#8208;aminopyridineswith suitable alcohols or diols provides access to novel organocatalysts of the unprecedented diarylpyrrolidionopyridine type, as well as new benzylmethylaminopyridine catalysts. These catalysts are practically inaccessible by other routes and exhibit high activity and site selectivity in the phosphorylation of amphiphilic diols.

p&#8208;Dialkylaminopyridines represent a key class of nucleophilic organocatalysts, widely used in alcohol&#8208;modifying reactions, among other applications. However, access to certain variants of these catalysts, particularly those with sterically congested secondary sphere, remains challenging or even unfeasible using previously established synthetic routes. Lewis acid&#8208;promoted benzylation or cyclative dibenzylation of simple aminopyridines with corresponding alcohols effectively overcomes these shortcomings. This innovative approach enables the synthesis of previously inaccessible (2,5&#8208;diarylpyrrolidino)pyridines and novel (N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;N&#8208;methylamino)pyridines bearing extended ortho&#8208;alkoxy tails on the aryl substituents. The new catalysts, characterized by their bulky secondary sphere, exhibit outstanding activity and high site&#8208;selectivity in the phosphorylation of a model diol amphiphile.

         <title>A New Paradigm for the Supramolecular Structure of Laterally Offset Diarenes: Polymorphs II of Para&#8208;Substituted Acetophenone Azines, Yp&#63743;Ph&#63743;(Me)C&#63742;N&#63743;N&#63742;C(Me)&#63743;Ph&#63743;Yp (Y&#8201;=&#8201;Cl, Br, CH3)</title>

         <dc:description>
While polymorphs I contain C2&#8208;symmetric enantiomers with pronounced azine twists and disrotatory phenyl twists, the acetophenone azine molecules in the new polymorphs II are Ci&#8208;symmetric with trans azine moieties and conrotatory phenyl twists. The three polymorphs II exemplify the new Paradigm IV for the supramolecular architectures of &#8220;laterally offset diarenes&#8221; and result in &#8220;shiplap/flat&#8221; idioteloamphiphile monolayers (IAMs).

The crystal structures of polymorphs II of acetophenone azines Yp&#63743;Ph&#63743;RC&#63742;N&#63743;N&#63742;CR&#63743;Ph&#63743;Yp with R&#8201;=&#8201;CH3 and Y&#8201;=&#8201;Cl (1M), Br (2M), and CH3 (8M) are discussed. The azine molecules in polymorphs II are Ci&#8208;symmetric with trans&#8208;azine moieties and conrotatory phenyl twists. Polymorphs 1M&#8208;I and 2M&#8208;I contain C2&#8208;symmetric enantiomers with pronounced azine twists and disrotatory phenyl twists and allow for strong lateral double T&#8208;contacts. The three polymorphs II exemplify the new Paradigm IV for the supramolecular architectures of &#8220;laterally offset diarenes&#8221; and result in &#8220;shiplap/flat&#8221; idioteloamphiphile monolayers. Intralayer lateral attraction is provided by edge&#8208;to&#8208;face arene&#8208;arene contacts between molecules with substantial longitudinal offset and involves arene edges bridging one azine&#8208;N and one phenyl center (EAzArB synthon) or one phenyl center and substituent Y (EYArB synthon) of different neighbors. These bridging synthons are characterized by a survey of pertinent structure parameters and their structural significance is corroborated by analysis of distance mapped Hirshfeld surfaces and the computation of 2D&#8208;fingerprint plots. The edge&#8208;to&#8208;face contacts are the most attractive intermolecular interactions, and these interactions are quantified via the computed pair interaction energies and the results of aromatic analyzer analysis. Synthon binding energies and lattice energies are determined to assess polymorph preference energies.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Doped Hydrotalcite: A Heterogeneous Catalyst for the Selective Synthesis of 2&#8208;Substituted Benzimidazoles and Benzothiazoles Using Alcohols and Solvent&#8208;Free Reaction Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;doped calcium aluminium hydrotalcite was synthesised and employed for the selective synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted benzimidazoles and benzothiazoles. The developed protocol uses low oxidation chemicals (alcohols) under solvent&#8208;free reaction conditions, recyclable catalyst and broad substrate scope. Mechanistic study provides an insight into the mechanism of the reaction.

A heterogeneous iron&#8208;anchored calcium aluminum hydrotalcite is prepared and characterized appropriately using powder X&#8208;Ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X&#8208;Ray, transmission electron microscope, ourier&#8208;transform infrared, and thermogravimetric analysis. Further, X&#8208;Ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the presence of Fe in +3 oxidation state. The prepared heterogeneous catalyst is applied to the selective synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted benzimidazole and benzothiazole derivatives using alcohols and under solvent&#8208;free reaction conditions. The developed protocol is applicable to a broad range of substrates, including difficult aliphatic substrates. The Fe/CaAl hydrotalcite catalyst can also be recycled and reused effectively for two catalytic cycles. Furthermore, control experiments reveal the role of the catalyst and the plausible mechanistic pathway of the reaction.

         <title>A Family of Methylene&#8208;Bridged Fully Functionalized Polynitroarenes and Tetrazole&#8208;Based Energetic Materials</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of methylene&#8208;bridged fully functionalized polynitroarenes and tetrazole&#8208;based energetic materials is reported. This approach enables the modification of the energetic properties of polynitroarenes by mono&#8208; and tricationic salt formation.

Herein, to fine&#8208;tune the energetic properties of 2,4,6&#8208;trinitrobenzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;diamine/diol, these are combined with tetrazole via a methylene bridge. This strategy unlocks the tunability of polynitroarenes performances via salt formation, which is restricted in directly C&#63743;N connected polynitroarenes and azole derivatives. The amino/hydroxy functionalities between the nitro groups on the benzene ring provide extensive inter&#8208; and intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions, contributing to improved stability, whereas the tetrazole ring increases the nitrogen percentage and energetic performance. Due to the presence of one and three labile protons in the amino derivative (compounds 4) and hydroxy derivative (compounds 5), respectively, a series of mono&#8208; and tricationic salts are prepared to further fine&#8208;tune the overall performances. Among all the synthesized compounds, the tricationic energetic salt 10 (Dv&#8201;=&#8201;8135&#8201;m&#8201;s&#8722;1, IS&#8201;&gt;&#8201;40&#8201;J) exhibits energetic performance comparable to TATB and is insensitive. All the compounds are characterized through infrared spectroscopy, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, elemental analysis, and high&#8208;resolution mass spectra studies. The relationship between structure and properties is further explored using Hirshfeld surface, noncovalent interaction, Localized Orbital Locator (LOL)&#8208;&#960;, and electrostatic potential analysis.

         <title>The Nonlinear Optical Behavior of Linear Diamantane Polyamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diamondoid&#8208;based polyamides exhibit nonlinear optical properties, namely, they emit white light upon continuous&#8208;wave irradiation with infrared lasers. The use of diamantane monomers significantly enhances the thermal stability of such novel polyamides, thereby opening new avenues for efficient and durable, organic lighting applications.

We report the synthesis and characterization of a new family of single&#8208;component polyamides incorporating rigid diamantane monomers, and investigate their structural, thermal, and nonlinear optical properties. These polymers are largely amorphous and exhibit exceptional thermal stability, with decomposition events in the 400&#8211;600&#8201;&#176;C range, significantly exceeding those of conventional nylons such as nylon&#8208;6 and nylon&#8208;66. Thermal analysis further shows that polyamides containing aromatic units retain higher residual yields than purely aliphatic analogues. Powder X&#8208;Ray diffraction, dynamic light scattering, and scanning electron microscopy reveal pronounced morphological differences, ranging from irregular nanoscale particulates to smooth, rubbery domains. A direct correlation between morphology and optical behavior is observed: polyamides with disordered or finely particulate structures display intrinsic white&#8208;light emission (WLE, 490&#8211;700&#8201;nm, &#955;max&#8201;&#8776;&#8201;610&#8201;nm) under continuous near&#8208;infrared (980&#8201;nm) laser irradiation, whereas the smooth morphology suppresses this response. Importantly, this dopant&#8208;free WLE is unprecedented for polyamides, identifying diamantane&#8208;based polymers as an attractive platform for efficient, thermally robust, and cost&#8208;effective organic light&#8208;emitting materials.

         <title>Discovery of Some New Heterocyclic Systems from Carbene&#8208;Based Reactions of Indigo and N&#8208;Methyl Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accessing new heterocyclic structural space on exposure of indigo&#8208;based substrates to carbene or carbenoid reactive intermediates is the key focus of this work. A number of unprecedented heterocyclic products have been discovered and their structures characterized. Mechanistic comment on the possible cascade processes leading to the products is also presented.

Reactions of N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethylindigo with dichlorocarbene or rhodium carbenoids have been investigated leading to the one&#8208;pot production of new, complex heterocyclic derivatives. One of these arises from an overall ring interconversion process with ring expansion to afford a novel eight&#8208;membered ring&#8208;fused benz[6,7][1,5]oxazocino[3,2&#8208;b]indol&#8208;13&#8208;one derivative. Alternatively, an overall ring construction process gives rise to an unprecedented spirocyclic 2H,4H&#8208;spiro[furo[3,2&#8208;b]indole&#8208;3,2&#8242;&#8208;indoline] system. A number of products with an embedded 6H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;a:3,4&#8208;b&#8242;]diindole core from reaction with a rhodium malonyl ester carbenoid intermediate are also reported, plus some other carbenoid&#8208;derived products. A solvent dependence is apparent with these reactions. Reaction path differences are also seen using N&#8208;methylindigo or the parent indigo as the substrate and possible mechanisms are proposed.

Synthesis of 2&#8208;iminothiazolines derived from sulfoxonium ylides is disclosed. The method overcomes current limitation of substrate scope. An array of useful functionalities is tolerated under reaction conditions.

A method is reported which allows for a three&#8208;component cyclization of sulfoxonium ylides, aryl isothiocyanates, and amines to yield 2&#8208;iminothiazolines. The method overcomes the limitation from the scope&#8208;of&#8208;substrate perspective. Success relies on the use of nickel(II) bromide, presumably acting as a Lewis acid catalyst. Investigation of substrate scopes reveals the compatibility of an array of useful functionalities.

         <title>Heavy Atom&#8208;Enhanced Photooxidation Performance of Carbazole&#8208;Substituted BODIPY Dyes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbazole&#8208;substituted halogenated BODIPY dyes exhibit enhanced intersystem crossing and singlet oxygen generation via the heavy&#8208;atom effect, enabling efficient photocatalytic oxidation of 1,5&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene to juglone.

In this study, halogenated BODIPYs (C&#8208;Br2&#8208;BDPY and C&#8208;I2&#8208;BDPY) bearing a carbazole group at the meso position are synthesized and characterized using various spectroscopic techniques. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of the C&#8208;I2&#8208;BDPY revealed that it crystallizes in a triclinic crystal system with a P&#8208;1 space group. The optical properties, singlet oxygen generation capacities, and photocatalytic activities of the BODIPY derivatives are evaluated with respect to juglone synthesis. While the nonhalogenated BODIPY (C&#8208;BDPY) exhibit negligible singlet oxygen generation (&#934;&#916;&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05), the iodinated (C&#8208;I2&#8208;BDPY) and brominated (C&#8208;Br2&#8208;BDPY) derivatives demonstrate considerably higher singlet oxygen quantum yields of 0.82 and 0.73, respectively. In the photooxidation reaction of 1,5&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) to juglone, these halogenated BODIPY compounds achieve conversion yields of 62.6% for C&#8208;Br2&#8208;BDPY and 87.8% for C&#8208;I2&#8208;BDPY within one hour. The turnover number values of the BODIPY photosensitizers show a continuous increase over time, indicating sustained product formation, whereas the turnover frequency values gradually decline, reflecting the decrease in reaction rate as the process progress. Density functional theory calculations support the experimental results by demonstrating that the presence of heavy atoms facilitates intersystem crossing and enhances the thermodynamic feasibility of the photooxidation reactions.

         <title>Ni(OAc)2 Catalyzed N&#8208;Formylation of Primary Sulfonamides Using Carbon Dioxide at Ambient Pressure</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of carbon dioxide as a formyl equivalent toward the N&#8208;formylation of primary sulfonamides has been developed. This Ni(OAc)2 catalyzed protocol employs carbon dioxide under ambient pressure and enables the formylation of aryl, heteroaryl, and alkyl sulfonamides.

A Ni(OAc)2 catalyzed N&#8208;formylation of primary sulfonamides using gaseous carbon dioxide is reported. A range of aromatic, heteroaromatic, and aliphatic sulfonamides are formylated under ambient pressure of carbon dioxide in a closed system. This redox&#8208;neutral method represents a mechanistically novel and operationally convenient method for employing carbon dioxide as a formyl equivalent.

         <title>Cellulose&#8208;Based Nanosponges Loaded with Palladium as Efficient Heterogeneous Catalysts for the Synthesis of Challenging Derivatives with Pharmaceutical Relevance</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 36, September 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a cellulose&#8208;based heterogeneous palladium catalyst (CNS&#8208;Pd) for the efficient and selective Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant heterocyclic derivatives, including scaffolds derived from unstable boronic molecules. The study emphasizes the use of mild conditions, high yields, and reduced palladium leaching, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional homogeneous systems in complex molecule synthesis.

Developing efficient catalytic systems is crucial for synthesizing complex heterocyclic compounds used in pharmaceuticals. However, key motifs, like pyridine and furan derivatives, pose challenges due to regioselectivity and sensitivity to harsh conditions. Conventional homogeneous palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, while effective, suffer from catalyst recovery issues, palladium contamination, and environmental concerns. To overcome these limitations, this study explores cellulose&#8208;based nanosponges as sustainable palladium supports for heterogeneous catalysis, enhancing stability and green chemistry integration. These nanostructured materials, synthesized from cellulose, provide a high&#8208;surface&#8208;area scaffold that enhances uniform palladium dispersion, with a 22% w/w overall loading measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, and prevents metal leaching, integrating green chemistry principles and a safe&#8208;and&#8208;sustainable&#8208;by&#8208;design approach. In this work, the optimization of Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura couplings using CNS&#8208;Pd under mild conditions, showcasing the efficiency and selectivity of this heterogeneous catalyst in the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant heterocyclic derivatives, is presented. Notably, high reaction yields (65%&#8211;99%) even with unstable boronic derivatives are achieved, which are typically synthesized using homogeneous catalysts, often with poor yields, selectivity and purity of the final products. The obtained results underscore the potential of biopolymer&#8208;based catalysts to drive innovation in sustainable pharmaceutical synthesis, effectively bridging the gap between heterogeneous catalysis and pharmaceutical chemistry.

         <title>A Fullerene&#8208;Based Selenosugar Ball</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 36, September 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fullerene hexakis&#8208;adduct decorated with 12 peripheral seleno&#8208;d&#8208;talitol moieties is synthesized efficiently with a Th&#8208;symmetry from a hexakis&#8208;adduct of [60]fullerene prepared by a cycloaddition reaction and subsequent copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition click chemistry. This new compound is characterized by analytical and spectroscopic techniques and is tested on human keratinocyte HaCaT cells to determine its cytotoxicity and potential applications.

Fullerenes functionalized with selenosugar moieties are of particular interest because of their important properties, as one fragment enhances the properties of the other. Selenosugars are not only solubilizing groups, but their intrinsic biological properties also provide additional attractive features to the conjugates. Here the synthesis is reported of a fullerene hexakis&#8208;adduct decorated with 12 peripheral seleno&#8208;d&#8208;talitol moieties with a Th&#8208;symmetric structure, which can be efficiently synthesized from the hexakis&#8208;adduct of [60]fullerene prepared via a cycloaddition reaction and subsequent copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition click chemistry. This large&#8208;scale system, refer to as the selenosugar ball (SeB), has been characterized by 1H&#8201;NMR and 13C&#8201;NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, UV&#8208;spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Theoretical calculations using the multilevel DFT&#8208;B3LYP&#8208;D3(BJ)/6&#8211;311&#8201;G(2&#8201;d,p)//PM7 methodology are performed to predict the most stable conformation for the compound and to determine the factors that control the geometry of this molecule. In addition, some physicochemical parameters are estimated. Also, this new compound is tested on human keratinocyte HaCaT cells to determine its cytotoxicity and potential applications.

         <title>Efficient Hydrosilylation Reaction of Olefins Catalyzed by a Dinuclear Ruthenium Complex</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 36, September 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under mild reaction conditions, the dinuclear ruthenium catalyst is used to achieve an anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrosilylation reaction of olefins. Notably, the reaction is extremely selective and no alkenylsilanes, olefin reduction products, or isomerization products are detected in this reaction.

Dinuclear metal synergistic catalysis is presented as a strategy for the hydrosilylation of olefins. Both aliphatic and aromatic olefins smoothly undergo anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrosilylation under mild reaction conditions to produce the corresponding organosilicon products in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields (42&#8211;96%) with high selectivity. The formation of alkenylsilanes, olefin reduction products, and isomerization products is not observed. Synthetically valuable functional groups such as chloro atom, methoxycarbonyl, and ester are tolerated well under the current reaction conditions. Control experiments and mechanistic studies suggest a synergistic catalytic mechanism involving bimetallic cooperation.

These aryne photoprecursors participate in [3&#8201;+&#8201;2] and [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloadditions, as well as in metal&#8208;free C&#63743;N couplings, with good functional group tolerance. Their utility is demonstrated in the synthesis of an advanced intermediate for aporphine alkaloids.

Herein, 2&#8208;(3&#8208;acetyl&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;triazen&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzoic acids are synthesized from anthranilic acids, including two new derivatives, without the use of strong bases. These compounds allow the slow and controlled generation of arynes via a white light&#8208;induced process, which participates in [3&#8201;+&#8201;2] and [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition reactions, as well as in a metal&#8208;free C&#63743;N bond formation reaction. This chemistry, which tolerates sulfur&#8208;, boron&#8208;, and silicon&#8208;containing compounds, is successfully performed on a scale of up to 1.5&#8201;mmol. A radical mechanism for the photogeneration of arynes is proposed based on a control reaction using TEMPO. In addition, the application of triazenylbenzoic acids is evaluated through the synthesis of a dehydroaporphine compound, which is an advanced synthetic intermediate for the synthesis of aporphine alkaloids.

A radical mechanism for the photogeneration of arynes is proposed based on a control reaction using TEMPO. In addition, the application of triazenylbenzoic acids is evaluated through the synthesis of a dehydroaporphine compound, which is an advanced synthetic intermediate for the synthesis of aporphine alkaloids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effects of Ring Strain on Molecular Dynamics of Sterically Hindered 4,7&#8208;Phenanthroline Unit</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 36, September 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sterically hindered 1,10&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;4,7&#8208;phenanthroline derivative is synthesized via the Povarov reaction and incorporated into a cyclic conjugated structure via a gold macrocyclic complex to evaluate effects of ring strain on molecular dynamics of the 4,7&#8722;phenanthroline moieties. The rotation rate of the phenyl groups in the cyclic trimer is faster than that in the model compound without ring strain. 

The Povarov reaction is a well&#8208;known multicomponent reaction for the synthesis of quinoline derivatives from anilines, arylaldehydes, and dienophiles such as electron&#8208;rich alkenes and alkynes. In this study, a sterically hindered 1,10&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;4,7&#8208;phenanthroline derivative is synthesized via the Povarov reaction and incorporated into a cyclic conjugated structure to evaluate the effects of ring strain on the molecular dynamics of the 4,7&#8208;phenanthroline moieties. The phenanthroline derivative is converted into a cyclic trimer, [3]McPhen, via a gold (Au) macrocyclic complex. The rate of rotation of the phenyl groups in [3]McPhen is found to be faster than that in the model compound without ring strain. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the ring strain of [3]McPhen causes a favorable orientation of the phenyl groups for rotation. This research offers valuable insights into the influence of ring strain on the dynamics of the molecular components.

         <title>Efficient Route for Construction of Fluorinated Isoxazolines through Base&#8208;Mediated Fluorinated Amino Acid Derivatives</title>

A base&#8208;mediated, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free reaction between ethyl 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;((diphenylmethylene)amino)&#8208;3,3&#8208;difluoropropanoate and nitrones facilitates a rapid, one&#8208;step synthesis of fluorinated isoxazolidines. This streamlined protocol proceeds under mild conditions to construct the valuable heterocyclic scaffold efficiently, with broad substrate scope and high practicality.

Isoxazolines have attracted widespread attention for the development of anticancer, antiviral, and anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs due to their unique electronic properties and conformational rigidity. However, the application of fluorinated isoxazolines in the development of innovative drugs has been constrained by the lack of appropriate synthetic methods for introducing fluorine atoms into the isoxazole ring skeleton. In this article, a rapid synthesis of fluoroisoxazolines is reported based on a pre&#8208;functionalization strategy: ethyl 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;((diphenylmethylene)amino)&#8208;3,3&#8208;difluoropropionate is reacted with imine oxides under alkaline conditions to efficiently construct the fluoroisoxazolidine skeleton in one step without the need for transition metal catalysts. This simple operation is performed under mild green reaction conditions, offering a concise and efficient pathway for the synthesis of fluoroisoxazololidine compounds.

Construction of 8&#8211;10 membered rings is achieved via a base&#8208;promoted two carbon ring expansion as a general strategy to formally insert a vinyl group to cyclic ketones.

Medium&#8208;sized ring architectures, widely present in natural products and small molecular drugs, are challenging synthetic targets. Herein, a base&#8208;promoted two&#8208;carbon ring expansion is described as a general strategy to formally insert a vinyl group to cyclic ketones. This method efficiently constructs a wide range of fused&#8208;medium&#8208;sized (8&#8211;10&#8208;membered) ring systems and successfully applies to the late&#8208;stage skeleton editing of complex natural products. Notable features of the procedure include readily available materials, wide substrate scope, and mild conditions.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 36, September 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thioester transfer strategy employing thioformates as dual sulfur/carbonyl sources enables efficient thiocarbonylation of benzyl chlorides. This method bypasses toxic CO and malodorous thiols, offering broad substrate scope and mild conditions for diverse thioester synthesis. The protocol enhances practicality in organic and biomolecular applications.

Thioesters are vital synthons in organic synthesis and biological processes, yet their synthesis often&#8201;faces challenges such as the use of toxic CO, malodorous thiophenols, and restricted substrate scope. To address these challenges, this study develops a thioester transfer strategy using thioformates as both sulfur and carbonyl sources, which enables the thiocarbonylation of benzyl chlorides. This approach facilitates the successful coupling of thioformates with benzyl chloride, providing efficient access to diverse thioesters. This advancement broadens the substrate scope and enhances the practicality of thioester synthesis in organic chemistry.

Fjord&#8208;Stitching Strategy Enables Chiral Heteroatom&#8208;Doped Zigzag Hydrocarbon Belts! Herein, the synthesis of chiral heteroatom&#8208;embedded hydrocarbon belts via fjord&#8208;stitching C&#63743;N coupling reactions of easily accessible resorcin[4]arene and resorcin[6]arene derivatives with diverse chiral amines is demonstrated.

Herein, the synthesis of diverse chiral O/N&#8208;doped zigzag hydrocarbon belts based on bridging of the fjords of resorcin[4]arene and resorcin[6]arene derivatives with chiral amines through palladium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular C&#63743;N bond formation reactions is reported. The resulting nanobelts exhibit unique chiral cavity structures and demonstrate intriguing chiroptical properties. Furthermore, a chiral transfer process from small molecule amines to the hydrocarbon nanobelts, offering new insights for designing and synthesizing novel chiral nanobelts is uncovered.

         <title>Copper Coils as Efficient and Inexpensive Reactors for the Synthesis of Tetrazoles in Flow Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 36, September 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;coil reactors are used for the synthesis of tetrazoles starting from benzonitriles in continuous flow. The reaction is carried out at high temperatures and residence times, in the presence of sodium azide, making the flow chemistry approach safer than the batch alternatives. Several tetrazoles have been prepared, including a key precursor of sartan drugs.

Sartans are an important family of drugs used to treat hypertension. A common characteristic of most of them is a biphenyl moiety with a tetrazole ring in the ortho position of the phenyl&#8211;phenyl bond. This tetrazole is typically synthesized from the respective nitriles through a [3&#8201;+&#8201;2] azide&#8208;nitrile cycloaddition. However, the use of large amounts of azides at high temperatures for extended periods of time is inherently concerning, as serious accidents can occur if safety protocols are not thoroughly developed and implemented. The implementation of these procedures in continuous flow would therefore be beneficial from the safety perspective. In this article, a method is presented for the preparation of tetrazoles from the respective nitriles employing a copper coil as reactor and catalyst. The reaction parameters have been studied and optimized to maximize conversion. A variety of benzonitriles with different ring substituents have been transformed in moderate to good yields and copper leaching has been analyzed, showing that the copper leached is enough to catalyze this reaction. More interestingly, the method has been applied to obtain the tetrazole ring present in a key intermediate used in sartan manufacturing, a highly sterically hindered compound.

Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed directing group&#8208;assisted C&#63743;H functionalization, offers atom&#8208;economical routes to synthesize and functionalize complex molecules. This review covers recent advancements in N,O&#8208;bidentate directing group&#8208;assisted C&#63743;O, C&#63743;N, C&#63743;S, C&#63743;B, and C&#63743;C bond formations, integrating mechanistic insights, diverse catalysts, and synthetic applications, emphasizing their profound impact on modern organic synthesis.

During the past decades, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H functionalization has gained recognition as a powerful method in organic synthesis. This strategy provides efficient and atom&#8208;economical pathways for quickly creating molecular complexity by harnessing the abundant C&#63743;H bonds found in readily accessible chemical feedstocks. Synthetic organic chemists discover directing group (DG)&#8208;assisted C&#63743;H activation as a key tool for achieving efficient and site&#8208;selective C&#63743;H functionalization. Bidentate directing groups are particularly effective in this regard, offering a high degree of control over the reaction site. Among various directing groups, N,O&#8208;bidentate systems have gained significant attention due to their strong coordinating ability and versatility in enabling regioselective transformations. This review highlights recent advances in C&#63743;O, C&#63743;N, C&#63743;S, C&#63743;B, and C&#63743;C bond formation reactions facilitated by N,O&#8208;bidentate directing groups. The discussion encompasses mechanistic insights, catalyst systems, and synthetic applications, demonstrating the broad utility of these strategies in modern organic synthesis. A comparative analysis of different N,O&#8208;bidentate ligands and their role in tuning reactivity and selectivity is also presented.

This review serves as a foundation for developing more efficient and eco-friendly approaches to constructing the isoquinolin-1(2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-one scaffold.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Herein, an easy&#8208;to&#8208;access and TM&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step synthesis of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;aroyl&#8208;5&#8208;sulfonamide substituted benzo[b]furans bearing many functional groups of different electronic and steric nature using thioamides and N&#8208;tosylbenzoquinone imine at room temperature in open air is reported for the first time.

Benzofuran derivatives are core components in many biologically active natural and synthetic compounds including approved drugs. Herein, an easy&#8208;to&#8208;access and TM&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step synthesis of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;aroyl&#8208;5&#8208;sulfonamide substituted benzo[b]furans bearing many functional groups of different electronic and steric nature using thioamides (as a 2C synthon) and N&#8208;tosylbenzoquinone imine (as a CCO unit partner) at room temperature in open air is presented for the first time. The reaction proceeds via deprotonation/Michael addition/cyclization/aromatization cascades forming two new (C&#63743;C and C&#63743;O) bonds and one ring, liberating only H2S as a byproduct. High resolution mass spectrometry study endorses the key intermediates involved during reaction, validating excellent regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity. This protocol will not only provide an efficient and scalable method to access diverse benzo[b]furans that could be adaptable to late&#8208;stage functionalization but also enrich the research domain of thioamides.

         <title>Activation in Organic and Macromolecular Including Peptide Synthesis by Fluorinated Carboxylic Acids and Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept paper highlights the importance and the historical developments of activated carboxylic acids in organic, macromolecular, bioorthogonal, and peptide synthesis. It dicusses the use of activated ester, including fluorinated activated ester and other activated carboxylic acid derivatives. The reactivity of various classes of activated carboylic acid derivatives obtained by fluorinated is discussed by employing aminolysis and transesterification reactions.

This concept article discusses recent developments in activated esters, including fluorinated activated esters and other activated carboxylic acid derivatives. Activated carboxylic acid derivatives, including esters, are of interest since 1901 when Emil Fischer prepared the first peptide, and soon after, for the synthesis of Nylons, Kevlar, and other condensation polymers. Since the synthesis of sequence&#8208;defined peptides and methodologies for their construction relied mostly on the development of activated ester derivatives, the preparation of the peptide and amide bond is used as a strategy for the organization and the development of this concept article. Therefore, the acyl chlorides, anhydrides, numerous nonfluorinated activated esters, and fluorinated activated esters, including pentachlorophenyl, pentafluorophenyl, hexafluoroisopropyl, and other fluorinated esters, will be discussed in aminolysis and transesterification reactions. The synthesis of peptide and amide bond, the modification of polymers, the bioorthogonal chemistry, and the living chain&#8208;growth condensation polymerization are also briefly discussed. This concept article ends with a brief mention of the resurgence of acyl fluoride in organic and macromolecular chemistry.

         <title>All&#8208;Visible&#8208;Light Diarylethene Photoswitches and Control over Dynamic Conjugate Addition Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoswitches by fusing &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl motif with dithienylethene (DTE) scaffold. The photoswitches exhibit reversible photochromic behavior under visible&#8208;light, with enhanced efficiency through electronic modulation. Moreover, DTEs enable visible&#8208;light&#8208;controlled C&#63743;S bond formation and cleavage, providing a platform for recyclable and biocompatible materials.

All&#8208;visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoswitches are gaining significant attention for their environmental friendliness and biocompatibility. Here, a series of visible&#8208;light responsive photoswitches is presented by embedding &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl motifs into the ethene bridge of dithienylethene (DTE) scaffolds. Through electronic modulation and &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension, the absorption is redshifted into the visible range, enabling reversible photochromic ring&#8208;closure and ring&#8208;opening under blue and red light, respectively. Density functional theory calculations reveal that electron&#8208;withdrawing groups and extended conjugation narrow the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, enhancing photoswitching efficiency. Furthermore, these photoswitches also function as dynamic Michael acceptors, allowing visible&#8208;light&#8208;controlled C&#63743;S bond formation and cleavage with great reversibility. The work described offers a versatile platform for visible&#8208;light&#8208;regulated dynamic covalent chemistry and paves the way for the development of recyclable, biocompatible materials.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of Imino Lactones with Ylidene&#8208;Pyrazolones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction of imino lactones with ylidene&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones is catalyzed effectively by Cu(MeCN)4BF4/Fesulphos to give spiropyrazolones in good yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. A wide range of substrates is successfully applied, and spiropyrazolones bearing various substituents are obtained under the optimized conditions.

A Cu(MeCN)4BF4/Fesulphos complex successfully catalyzes the asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition (1,3&#8208;DC) of imino lactones with 4&#8208;ylidene&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones to afford bis&#8208;spirocyclic pyrrolidines in good yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr, 99% ee). In addition, exo'&#8208;(2,5&#8208;trans&#8208;4,5&#8208;trans)&#8208;pyrrolidine scaffolds are exclusively produced as single diastereomers. A wide variety of imino lactones bearing electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the phenyl groups and heteroaryl substrates is employed in this reaction. The substrate scope of ylidene&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones is investigated, and the substituents on the phenyl ring have limited effect on the product yields and stereoselectivity of the reaction.

         <title>Exploring the Regioselectivity of Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions of 2,6&#8208;Disubstituted Benzoquinones through DFT Calculations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of 19 substituents on the regioselectivity of Diels&#8211;Alder reactions is explored by quantum chemistry. Experimentally observed product distributions are compared favorably with calculated reaction barrier trends. Unlike interaction energies, the deformation energies corresponding to the two regioisomers differ significantly and follow the same trend as experimental product ratios.

Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;6&#8208;substituted&#8208;p&#8208;benzoquinones are studied using quantum chemical calculations. The effect of 19 substituents, including halomethyl, alkyl, vinyl, ethynyl, nitrile, trifluoromethyl, methoxy, cyclohexenyl, phenyl, and trifluoromethoxyphenyl groups, on the reaction barriers is explored by the B3LYP&#8208;D3, M06&#8208;2X, and DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T) methods. Gibbs free activation energies are compared for the two regioisomeric products experimentally observed in the reaction mixture. For 75% of the substituents, the calculated barrier difference (&#916;G&#8225;b &#8211; &#916;G&#8225;a) lies within 2.0&#8201;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 of the value determined from the experimentally observed product ratio a/b. Activation barriers are further analyzed in terms of the underlying deformation and interaction energies. The difference in deformation energies of transition states corresponding to the two regioisomers ranges from &#8722;8.0 to +8.0&#8201;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and is directly proportional to experimental ln(a/b) values. Differences in interaction energies between regioisomeric transition states are, in comparison, significantly smaller.

     alt="Exploring the Regioselectivity of Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions of 2,6-Disubstituted Benzoquinones through DFT Calculations"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of 19 substituents on the regioselectivity of Diels&#8211;Alder reactions is explored by quantum chemistry. Experimentally observed product distributions are compared favorably with calculated reaction barrier trends. Unlike interaction energies, the deformation energies corresponding to the two regioisomers differ significantly and follow the same trend as experimental product ratios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of 2-methyl-6-substituted-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-benzoquinones are studied using quantum chemical calculations. The effect of 19 substituents, including halomethyl, alkyl, vinyl, ethynyl, nitrile, trifluoromethyl, methoxy, cyclohexenyl, phenyl, and trifluoromethoxyphenyl groups, on the reaction barriers is explored by the B3LYP-D3, M06-2X, and DLPNO-CCSD(T) methods. Gibbs free activation energies are compared for the two regioisomeric products experimentally observed in the reaction mixture. For 75% of the substituents, the calculated barrier difference (&#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8225;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt; &#8211; &#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8225;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;) lies within 2.0&#8201;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; of the value determined from the experimentally observed product ratio &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;/&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;. Activation barriers are further analyzed in terms of the underlying deformation and interaction energies. The difference in deformation energies of transition states corresponding to the two regioisomers ranges from &#8722;8.0 to +8.0&#8201;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and is directly proportional to experimental ln(&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;/&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;) values. Differences in interaction energies between regioisomeric transition states are, in comparison, significantly smaller.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical aerobic oxidation protocol using a benzothioxanthene imide as the photocatalyst at a low catalyst loading (0.01&#8201;mol%) is developed for the oxidation of boronic acids and esters.

Herein, a sustainable and eco&#8208;friendly protocol is reported for the aerobic photochemical oxidation of boronic acids or esters, utilizing a dibenzothioxanthene imide as the photocatalyst at a very low catalyst loading (0.01%) in 2&#8208;propanol, employing a 456&#8201;nm irradiation source. Additionally, this protocol is successfully applied to a variety of substrates.

         <title>Environmental Control of Regio&#8208;/Stereoselectivity Across Mechanistically Similar Transformations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lewis Acid (LA) catalysis offers a unifying strategy to tune nucleophilic additions. By modulating electrophile activation, LAs shift regioselectivity in epoxide openings and diastereoselectivity in carbonyl additions by 43&#8211;76%. Strong LAs (e.g., AlCl3, SnCl4) amplify subtle bond or face differences, enabling predictable, high&#8208;impact control across mechanistically related transformations.

The control of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity in organic transformations remains a foundational challenge in synthetic chemistry. While chemoselectivity can often be influenced by careful selection of reagents or protective groups, controlling regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity is far more nuanced, often requiring highly specific reaction conditions. In this work, a unified approach for controlling both regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity across mechanistically related transformations is explored, specifically focusing on epoxide openings and carbonyl additions. It is demonstrated that the same environmental factors, here the nature of the Lewis acid (LA), can be leveraged to influence divergent outcomes in these two reaction types by amplifying inherent differences between reaction sites/faces, leading to highly selective transformations. The systematic evaluation of over 30 Lewis acids revealed a dichotomy between &#8220;labile&#8221; and &#8220;strong&#8221; activation modes, where strong LAs, such as AlCl3 and SnCl4, drive the highest levels of regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity for both transformations. Further, there exists nuanced differences between the degree of influence of some LA within these mechanistically related transformations. These findings suggest that environmental factors can be broadly applied across different mechanistic classes to achieve selectivity, offering a versatile strategy for reaction optimization.

         <title>Synthesis and Photophysical Analysis of Amphiphilic Azobenzene Surfactants for Photomechanical Actuation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Subtle electronic modifications of tailored amphiphilic azobenzene derivatives exhibit distinct cis&#8208;state half&#8208;lives despite similar activation barriers. The structural functionalization enables the molecules to be soluble in water and organic solvents, making them photomechanical surfactants with different behavior in oil&#8208;in&#8208;water versus water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions.

Photoswitchable amphiphiles are promising candidates for investigating light&#8208;responsive mechanical behavior in soft and biological systems, with potential applications in dynamic materials and adaptive interfaces. Azobenzene is the most studied photoactuator, but research typically focuses on its standard backbone, limiting control over its photophysical and kinetic properties. Modifying its conjugated core offers new opportunities for tuning its behavior. Here, the synthesis and characterization of water&#8208;soluble azobenzene derivatives featuring a hexaethylene glycol (OCH2CH2)6 unit terminated with a sodium sulfate (O&#63743;SO3Na) group, alongside subtle electronic modifications to the conjugated backbone, are reported. Their steady&#8208;state photophysical properties and reversible photoisomerization kinetics in aqueous environments under real&#8208;time observation are demonstrated. Despite similar activation parameters for the thermal cis&#8211;trans isomerization in some derivatives, their half&#8208;lives vary significantly, underscoring the overlooked role of the transmission coefficient in isomerization kinetics. Finally, these photo&#8208;responsive amphiphiles are showcased as dynamic surfactants in oil&#8208;in&#8208;water and water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions, visualizing their behavior through operando microscopy. These findings underscore their potential for tunable emulsions and adaptive soft matter applications.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross Coupling of N&#8208;Alkenyl Heterocycles and Aryl Sulfonium Salts: Expedient Access to N&#8208;Benzyl Heterocycles</title>

         <dc:description>
The combination of a site&#8208;selective C&#63743;H dibenzothiophenation with nickel&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) cross coupling reaction is developed, offering an orthogonal protocol to traditional SN2 and C&#63743;N coupling methods to bioactive N&#8208;benzylic heterocycles. The mild conditions and good functional&#8208;group compatibility permit the rapid construction of molecular complexity and late&#8208;stage functionalization of arenes.

A nickel&#8208;catalyzed system is developed that enables the coupling between aryldibenzothiophenium salts and N&#8208;alkenyl heterocycles. Traditionally, medicinally relevant N&#8208;benzylic heterocycles are constructed via harsh substitution conditions between the N&#8208;H heterocycle and a benzyl electrophile in the presence of strong bases. The C&#63743;C cross coupling strategy presents attractive potential for the synthesis of these important scaffolds, e.g., carboetomidate. Herein, it is documented that the combination of a site&#8208;selective C&#63743;H dibenzothiophenation with a nickel&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) cross coupling grants access to a diverse range of synthetically useful N&#8208;benzylic heterocycles, i.e., alkylated arenes. In particular, the mild conditions and good functional group compatibility permit the rapid assembly of molecular complexity and late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive compounds, such as clofibrate, fenofibrate, and fenbufen, thus providing an orthogonal protocol to existing SN2 and C&#63743;N coupling approaches.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Four&#8208;Component Radical Carbonylation Reaction for the Construction of Benzofuranamide Derivativesitle</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of fluoroalkylated and carbonylated benzofuran derivatives are efficiently prepared by a multicomponent free&#8208;radical strategy involving the migration of a double bond and the insertion of a carbonyl group. The domino process avoids the preparation of precursors in the multistep reaction by accurately controlling the addition order between components and uses cheap and readily available raw materials.

A novel palladium&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component radical tandem cyclization&#8208;carbonylation of 1,6&#8208;enynes with aniline, carbon monoxide, and ethyl difluoroiodoacetate is reported. This approach facilitates a multicomponent reaction involving tandem 1,2&#8208;double bond migration, thereby allowing the efficient synthesis of alkylamide&#8208;substituted benzofuranamide derivatives.

&lt;p&gt;A series of fluoroalkylated and carbonylated benzofuran derivatives are efficiently prepared by a multicomponent free-radical strategy involving the migration of a double bond and the insertion of a carbonyl group. The domino process avoids the preparation of precursors in the multistep reaction by accurately controlling the addition order between components and uses cheap and readily available raw materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel palladium-catalyzed four-component radical tandem cyclization-carbonylation of 1,6-enynes with aniline, carbon monoxide, and ethyl difluoroiodoacetate is reported. This approach facilitates a multicomponent reaction involving tandem 1,2-double bond migration, thereby allowing the efficient synthesis of alkylamide-substituted benzofuranamide derivatives. The proposed strategy demonstrates a broad substrate scope, high efficiency in bond migratory-rearrangement, and controllable selectivity in the order of component addition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Acyl Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling from Carboxylic Acids In&#8201;Situ Activated by HATU: An Efficient Way to Ketones Laid by Nitrogen Coordination</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed acyl Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reaction between carboxylic acids and organoboronic acids is developed by using HATU as the in&#8201;situ activator, which provided a mild and versatile method for ketones synthesis. Experimental and density functional theory&#8208;computation studies disclosed the detailed role of the nitrogen&#8208;atom and the likely pathways.

A palladium&#8208;catalyzed acyl Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling between carboxylic acids and organoboronic acids has been developed, employing hexafluorophosphate azabenzotriazole tetramethyl uronium as an in situ activator. Using Pd2(dba)3/PCy3 as the catalyst and K2CO3 as the base, the reaction accommodates a broad range of both aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids. Controlled experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the pyridine nitrogen plays a critical role in the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Influence of Levulinoyl Protecting Groups on Glycosylation Stereoselectivity and Glycosyl Cation Structure</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of levulinoyl protecting groups on the glycosylation stereoselectivity and glycosyl cation structure is studied for galactose and mannose building blocks.

The stereoselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;cis glycosidic bonds is historically challenging, and a common synthetic approach is based on the participation of remote protecting ester groups. Common intermediates of glycosylation reactions are glycosyl cations, whose structures are difficult to characterize. Here, the glycosylation reactions and structure of the glycosyl cations of galactose and mannose are investigated when protected with levulinic acid (Lev) at C4 and/or C6, respectively. The glycosyl cations can be assigned to rearranged structures as a consequence of ring opening, as well as dioxolenium ions that suggest remote participation. Some evidence for the long&#8208;range interaction of the Lev keto group is found as previously proposed, which could explain unusual solution&#8208;phase stereoselectivities observed.

         <title>Fast Nucleophilic Approach to Exhaustively Substituted Porphyrin Derivatives at the &#8220;Eastern Half&#8221;</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;step procedure including the nitration of simple porphyrinates (Zn2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+ complexes) and very attractive vicarious nucleophilic substitution of hydrogen reaction gives porphyrin derivatives with unique structures, exhaustively &#946;&#8208;substituted in the so&#8208;called &#8220;Eastern half.&#8221; These types of hydrophilic or amphiphilic target products are sought in anticancer photodynamic therapy. It seems they are practically unavailable by any other alternative methods.

meso&#8208;Tetraarylporphyrin chelates (of Zn2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+) are easily available from parent porphyrins. Their reactions with nitric acid (yellow fuming HNO3, d&#8201;=&#8201;1.52, diluted to 25%&#8211;50%), under optimized conditions in CHCl3 at room temperature, can be carried out selectively, thus giving mainly &#946;,&#946;&#8208;dinitro&#8208;substituted moieties (usually two or three isomers of the above complexes). These intermediates (obtained in overall yields of up to 73%), upon the reaction with carbanions bearing a leaving group X at the reactive center, afford the target products, the ones of vicarious nucleophilic substitution (VNS) of hydrogen. This approach allows the synthesis of porphyrin derivatives exhaustively &#946;&#8208;substituted in the so&#8208;called &#8220;Eastern half&#8221;, starting from a simple meso&#8208;tetraarylporphyrins. These types of products are sought in anticancer photodynamic therapy (PDT). Thus, the above two&#8208;step procedure including very attractive VNS reaction gives hydrophilic or amphiphilic moieties that seem to be potential PDT agents with unique structures, being practically unavailable by any other alternative methods.

         <dc:description>
This review explores the synthesis, reactivity, and therapeutic potential of 1,3&#8208;diazetidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones&#8212;an underexplored class of aza&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams. Emphasis is placed on synthetic challenges, emerging methodologies, and their promise as &#946;&#8208;lactamase&#8208;resistant scaffolds in medicinal chemistry.

1,3&#8208;diazetidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones, overlooked members of the aza&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactam family, are structurally distinct four&#8208;membered nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles with strong potential in medicinal chemistry, particularly as &#946;&#8208;lactamase inhibitors and antibiotic analogues. This review provides a comprehensive overview of their synthesis, structural diversity, and biological significance. The most established synthetic method is the [2&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition between C&#63742;N nucleophiles and isocyanates, though this approach is highly substrate dependent and frequently leads to side products or cycloreversion. Alternative strategies&#8212;including photochemical and organometallic methodologies&#8212;have been explored but remain limited in scope. As a result, access to 1,3&#8208;diazetidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones is significantly constrained, impeding wider investigation and application. In&#8201;silico studies suggest favorable stability and reactivity profiles and indicate these compounds could circumvent &#946;&#8208;lactam resistance through hydrolysis&#8208;resistant enzyme intermediates. Several derivatives have demonstrated promising antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, and anticancer activities. Nevertheless, further synthetic innovation is essential to fully realize the therapeutic potential of this underexplored class of heterocycles.

         <title>Exploring the Chemical Reactivity of Triisopropylsilyl Dialkynylmethanol for the Synthesis of Dialkynylcarbinol&#8208;Related Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relevance of 1&#8208;(triisopropylsilyl)penta&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;ol as a versatile C5 organic framework is highlighted in both racemic and enantiopure form thanks to a finely optimized lipase&#8208;mediated enzymatic kinetic resolution procedure. This straightforward approach, exploiting the reactivity of the terminal alkyne group, opened the way for the most cytotoxic series to date of bioinspired lipidic alkynylcarbinols.

Prompted by the pharmacological relevance of lipidic alkynylcarbinols, 1&#8208;(triisopropylsilyl)penta&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;ol is exploited as a versatile C5 organic framework. Selective functionalization of this dissymmetrical dialkynylcarbinol precursor is achieved via the creation of either a Csp&#8211;Csp (alkyne), a Csp&#8211;Csp2 (alkene and aryl), or a Csp&#8211;Csp3 (RCHOH) bond. A novel series of racemic HSD17B11&#8208;bioactivated procytotoxic acetylenic lipids is accessed that revealed, amongst the most potent to date, with IC50 down to 27&#8201;nM on osteosarcoma U2OS cells. Click&#8208;type 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions, such as a copper&#8208;catalyzed reaction with a long&#8208;chain alkyl azide (CuAAC) and a base&#8208;promoted reaction with a lipidic nitrile oxide, are first described in a racemic version. Preparation of both enantiomers of 1&#8208;(triisopropylsilyl)penta&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;ol through kinetic enzymatic resolution with CAL&#8208;B immobilized on acrylic resin is carefully optimized.

&lt;p&gt;The relevance of 1-(triisopropylsilyl)penta-1,4-diyn-3-ol as a versatile C5 organic framework is highlighted in both racemic and enantiopure form thanks to a finely optimized lipase-mediated enzymatic kinetic resolution procedure. This straightforward approach, exploiting the reactivity of the terminal alkyne group, opened the way for the most cytotoxic series to date of bioinspired lipidic alkynylcarbinols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompted by the pharmacological relevance of lipidic alkynylcarbinols, 1-(triisopropylsilyl)penta-1,4-diyn-3-ol is exploited as a versatile C5 organic framework. Selective functionalization of this dissymmetrical dialkynylcarbinol precursor is achieved via the creation of either a Csp&#8211;Csp (alkyne), a Csp&#8211;Csp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (alkene and aryl), or a Csp&#8211;Csp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (RCHOH) bond. A novel series of racemic HSD17B11-bioactivated procytotoxic acetylenic lipids is accessed that revealed, amongst the most potent to date, with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; down to 27&#8201;nM on osteosarcoma U2OS cells. Click-type 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions, such as a copper-catalyzed reaction with a long-chain alkyl azide (CuAAC) and a base-promoted reaction with a lipidic nitrile oxide, are first described in a racemic version. Preparation of both enantiomers of 1-(triisopropylsilyl)penta-1,4-diyn-3-ol through kinetic enzymatic resolution with CAL-B immobilized on acrylic resin is carefully optimized. Finally, the use of resolved samples in 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions leads to the enantioenriched cycloadducts without significant epimerization of the carbinol center.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A new route to ionizable lipid KC2 through the double alkylation of TosMIC with linoleyl tosylate avoids problematic reactions, is higher yielding, and requires three fewer steps. Lipid MC3 is also more efficiently prepared by the new method.

Considerable interest exists in ionizable lipids (ILs) for the delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics. While not a component of a yet&#8208;approved medication, lipid KC2 is especially competent for the delivery of plasmid DNA, consequently it is in high demand on the part of research laboratories worldwide. Lipid MC3, a component of Onpattro, is a benchmark against which the efficacy of new ILs is evaluated. A new route to KC2 and MC3 through the double alkylation of TosMIC with linoleyl tosylate is described. The new synthesis avoids problematic reactions, proceeds in higher overall yield relative to the literature one, and in the case of KC2, involves three fewer steps.

         <title>Photoinduced Reduction and Deuteration of Aryl Halides with NHC&#8208;Boranes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced radical reduction and deuteration of aryliodides and arylbromides is achieved using NHC&#8208;borane without external initiators or photoredox catalysts. The reaction proceeds via aryl radicals and tolerates a broad range of functional groups, offering a practical and versatile approach for dehalogenation and isotopic labeling.

Herein, an operationally simple photoinduced radical reduction of aryliodides and arylbromides using NHC&#8208;borane as a reductant, without external radical initiator or photoredox catalyst, is reported. Mechanistic investigations indicate the key formation of an aryl radical, which undergoes facile reduction by NHC&#8208;borane. The method demonstrates compatibility with a broad range of functional groups, providing a valuable tool for synthesis and isotopic labeling.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Directed Sulfinylation of Distal C(sp3)&#63743;H Bonds by Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox/copper&#8208;cocatalyzed remote C&#63743;H sulfoxidation reaction is described that proceeds through radical&#8208;mediated 1,5&#8722;hydrogen atom transfer. A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction between N&#8722;alkoxypyridinium salts and sodium arylsulfinates gave a series of hydroxy sulfoxide derivatives. This transformation features redox&#8208;neutral conditions, broad functional group compatibility, and excellent site selectivity.

An efficient photoredox&#8208;catalyzed reaction is reported for site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#63743;H sulfoxidation of N&#8208;alkoxypyridinium salts using sodium arylsulfinates as sulfinyl donors. This transformation involves alkoxy&#8208;radical&#8208;directed 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (1,5&#8722;HAT) followed by C(sp3)&#63743;S bond formation. A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven, copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling strategy enables the synthesis of a series of hydroxyl sulfoxide derivatives. This methodology establishes a novel synthetic platform for rapid construction of sulfoxide&#8208;containing molecular architectures, demonstrating remarkable functional group compatibility and predictable regioselectivity.

         <dc:description>
A rapid synthesis of azosulfones can be accomplished in a vibrational mechanical mill, giving up to quantitative yields in as little as 30&#8201;min. The tolerance of the method is demonstrates on a broad substrate scope and is successfully used to produce 30 different products. Spectroscopic and computational studies provide insight into the process and its selectivity.

Azosulfones represent a potent and stable surrogate for diazonium salts. Their wide application in C&#8211;H functionalizations catalyzed by transition metals and visible light is well&#8208;known in organic chemistry. Here, a single&#8208;step mechanochemical synthesis of azosulfones is reported, starting from readily available precursors, which has high conversion efficacy &#8722;80%&#8211;99% isolated yields are obtained in most cases. A substrate scope of 30 different compounds is obtained. This method requires no solvent, it is quick and has potential in terms of scalability and tolerance toward a broad range of functional groups, which makes it attractive for synthesis. Spectroscopic and computational studies are performed to explain the observed reactivity patterns.

         <dc:description>
Phenanthridines, as important structural moieties of many naturally occurring products, pharmaceuticals, and functionalized polycyclic heteroarenes, have attracted considerable attention among chemists due to their significant potentials in pharmaceutical and material chemistry. Herein, a visible light&#8208;induced radical cascade cyclization of 2&#8208;isocyanobiaryls via 1,2&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer is described to rapidly synthesize phenanthridines under mild conditions. 

Phenanthridines, as important structural moieties of many naturally occurring products, pharmaceuticals, and functionalized polycyclic heteroarenes, have attracted considerable attention among chemists due to their significant potential in pharmaceutical and material chemistry. The hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process provides an important strategy for selective C&#63743;H functionalization. However, net 1,2&#8208;HAT processes have been reported and applied infrequently compared to the popularity of 1,5&#8208;HAT processes. Herein, a visible light&#8208;induced radical cascade cyclization of 2&#8208;isocyanobiaryls via 1,2&#8208;HAT is described to rapidly synthesize phenanthridines under mild conditions. This approach represents an example of radical cascade cyclization of 2&#8208;isocyanobiaryls via infrequent 1,2&#8208;HAT to access the phenanthridine core. This protocol features a 1,2&#8208;HAT, a radical cascade process, broad substrate scope, and good functional group compatibility under mild and oxidant&#8208;free reaction conditions.

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Aminomethyl&#8208;5R&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;Triazoles by Cyclization of Amidrazones: Multigram Approach and Revised Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of 3&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;5R&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoles from acyl hydrazides and methyl phthalimidoacetimidate is proposed. The reaction conditions are optimized to control the cyclization pathway, minimizing the formation of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole by&#8208;products. The intramolecular cyclization mechanism of amidrazones is discussed on the basis of quantum chemical calculations.

A series of 3&#8208;(aminomethyl)&#8208;5R&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoles is synthesized in gram&#8208;scale quantities starting from N&#8208;(cyanomethyl)phthalimide and carboxylic acid hydrazides. The intramolecular cyclization of amidrazones to give 1,2,4&#8208;triazolines is the key step. The main side products are 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazoles formed by a concurrent intramolecular condensation. Their amount depends on the steric and electronic nature of the substituent in the initial carboxylic acid hydrazide. Additionally, aminomethyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole is modified by the introduction of different substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4 of the heterocyclic scaffold. Quantum chemical calculations demonstrate a fine balance of activation energy values for the key stages in the formation of the two isomeric products. In contrast to the previously derived mechanism, the participation of water, not ammonia, is required as a&#8201;factor reducing the activation barriers for both reaction pathways.

         <title>Synthesis of Bis&#8208;Arylated Squaryls via Addition of Organocopper Species onto Squaryl Dichlorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple protocol for the iterative and selective introduction of diverse substituents relayed through organocopper chemistry has been developed, providing access to sophisticated bis&#8208;functionalized squaryl scaffolds. This provides a unified approach to access four&#8208;membered rings possessing useful functional handles.

Squaric chlorides serve as convenient, readily available building blocks in the synthetic path toward unsymmetrically substituted squaryls. The use of in&#8201;situ generated arylcopper reagents enables precise, selective control over stoichiometry and facilitates the creation of a diverse library of sophisticated structures.

Selective C&#63743;F Bond Activation in 1,1&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes: Synthesis of Functionalized Monofluoroalkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treatment of 2&#8208;aryloxy&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes with Me2AlCl promotes fluoride abstraction, followed by cyclopropane ring opening, to generate &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated oxocarbenium ions. These cations are trapped with nucleophiles such as arenes and silyl enol ethers to provide functionalized 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1&#8208;alkenes. The instability of vinyl cations prevents further fluoride abstraction, resulting in completely selective C&#63743;F bond activation.

Functionalized monofluoroalkenes (3&#8208;arylated and 5&#8208;oxygenated 1&#8208;aryloxy&#8208;2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1&#8208;alkenes) are synthesized via selective activation of the C&#63743;F bonds in 2&#8208;aryloxy&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes that are readily prepared from aryl vinyl ethers. Treatment of these difluorocyclopropanes with Me2AlCl promotes fluoride abstraction followed by cyclopropane ring opening to generate &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated oxocarbenium ions. These cations are subsequently trapped with nucleophiles, such as arenes and silyl enol ethers (Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208; and aldol&#8208;type reactions), to provide functionalized 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1&#8208;alkenes. Because of the instability of vinyl cations, further fluoride abstraction is suppressed, resulting in completely selective C&#63743;F bond activation.

A nickel&#8208;catalyzed carboalkoxylation and borylalkoxylation of the biphenylene C&#63743;C &#963;&#8208;bond has been developed to form the corresponding ring&#8208;opening oxygenative difunctionalization products. The key to success is the use of acetal&#8208;based, electron&#8208;deficient peroxides, which enable the otherwise challenging C&#63743;O cross coupling with nickel catalysts even under photo&#8208;free, thermal reaction conditions.

         <title>Exploration of Structure&#8211;Property Relationships by Altering Glycol Backbone Unsaturation (Double/Triple Bonds) in Furan&#8208;Based Polyesters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores how adding unsaturated groups to bio&#8208;based furanic polyesters can change their stiffness and heat resistance. While this offers new possibilities, it also needs careful control during production. It is shown that solution polycondensation works well for making these materials and offers a path toward more flexible, stable, and ecofriendly polymers.

This study highlights both the challenges and opportunities associated with developing bio&#8208;based furanic polyesters. Incorporating unsaturated moieties into glycol chains effectively modulates polymer rigidity and thermal properties, though it requires careful optimization of polymerization conditions. The findings demonstrate the viability of solution polycondensation for synthesizing high&#8208;quality FDCA&#8208;based polyesters with unsaturated glycols and pave the way for further investigations into polymer design strategies that balance flexibility, thermal stability, and environmental sustainability.

         <title>Elucidating the Mechanism and Origin of Site Selectivity in the Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#63743;H Functionalization of a Thioamide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The detailed reaction mechanism of the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#63743;H activation/amidation of a thioamide has been extensively investigated using density functional theory methods. The origin of site selectivity in the C(sp3)&#63743;H activation step is elucidated through structural analysis.

In the present study, the mechanism of cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#63743;H activation/amidation reaction of thioamide has been investigated using density functional theory. The computational results indicate that the activation of the primary C(sp3)&#63743;H bond is more energetically favorable than the secondary C(sp3)&#63743;H bond. The formation of a five&#8208;membered cobaltacycle is the key intermediate for the amidation reaction with dioxazolone. Based on the calculations, the amidation reaction of cobaltacycle intermediate proceeds through the sequential stepwise decarboxylation, migratory insertion, and proto&#8208;demetalation processes. The extended transition state&#8208;natural orbitals for chemical valence analysis verify that the primary C(sp3)&#63743;H activation occurs predominantly due to the stronger interfragment interaction.

The complex has been characterized by 1H and13C nuclear magnetic resonance&#160;spectroscopy and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. Additionally, the complex has been structurally characterized. This complex has been used as a homogeneous catalyst for the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones with benzylic alcohols as an alkylating agent in toluene at 120&#8201;&#176;C in the presence of Cs2CO3. The scope of the reaction extends to the synthesis of a fluorescent &#945;&#8208;alkylated product. Mechanistic insights suggest that the water molecule generated in&#8201;situ during the aldol condensation facilitates the reactivation of the catalytic species, thereby sustaining the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Sustainable Electrochemical Access to &#945;&#8208;Thiocyanate Ketones: A Metal&#8208;Free Protocol Utilizing Ammonium Thiocyanate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utilization of ammonium thiocyanate has been developed for the electrosynthesis of &#945;&#8208;thiocyanate ketones under environmental&#8208;friendly conditions, addressing limitations of conventional oxidative methods.

A robust and environmentally benign electrochemical method for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;thiocyanate ketones from aromatic ketones is reported. The protocol utilizes ammonium thiocyanate as both the thiocyanate source and supporting electrolyte in an undivided cell with platinum electrodes and an acetonitrile/water/sulfuric acid solvent system. This metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free transformation proceeds under mild conditions, exhibiting broad substrate scope, excellent functional group compatibility, and amenability to gram&#8208;scale operations. The developed approach offers a sustainable and practical alternative for accessing these valuable thiocyanated carbonyl compounds, addressing limitations of conventional oxidative methods.

         <title>Boron Difluoride Complexes with N,S&#8208;Schiff&#8208;base Ligands: Synthesis, Structure, and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron difluoride complexes with N,S&#8208;Schiff&#8208;base ligands exhibit distorted six&#8208;membered chelate structures due to sulfur coordination, leading to redshifted absorption and emission compared to N,O&#8208;chelate analogs. These results highlight their potential as tunable optical materials.

Boron difluoride complexes incorporating N,S&#8208;Schiff&#8208;base ligands are synthesized, and their structural and photophysical properties are investigated. The complexes are obtained via a one&#8208;pot synthetic route from 2&#8208;mercaptobenzaldehyde, yielding N,S&#8208;donor frameworks that coordinate with boron atoms to form six&#8208;membered chelate rings. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that these complexes adopt distorted coordination structures, attributed to the larger atomic radius of the sulfur atom. This geometric distortion results in redshifted absorption and emission spectra, in comparison to analogous N,O&#8208;Schiff&#8208;base boron difluoride complexes. These findings, supported by theoretical calculations, highlight the potential of N,S&#8208;Schiff&#8208;base boron difluoride complexes as tunable optical materials through both electronic and geometric modulation.

         <title>Basicity and Lipophilicity of gem&#8208;Difluorinated Saturated Bicyclic Amines: Advanced Building Blocks for Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed study of the physicochemical properties of gem&#8208;difluorinated bicyclic amines is reported. pKa and LogP measurements reveal interesting trends affected by the fluorination pattern of the compound and the bicyclic system itself, which are partially rationalized through molecular electrostatic potential surface analysis.

The impact of gem&#8208;difluorination on the physicochemical properties of bicyclic saturated amines with 6&#8211;8 atoms in the largest ring is studied. The fluorination effect on the acidity of protonated species (pKa) aligns with predictions based on the inductive effect of the electron&#8208;deficient substituent. In contrast, lipophilicity (LogP) could either increase or decrease due to gem&#8208;difluorination. The observed effect depends on the number of vicinal C&#63743;H bonds relative to the fluorine atoms, but it is also influenced by their relative spatial orientation and the structure of the bicyclic core itself.

         <title>Electrochemical Tandem Self&#8208;Coupling/Selenylation of Acetonitrile toward Highly Functionalized Tetrasubstituted Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical tandem self&#8208;coupling/selenylation of acetonitrile delivers (Z)&#8208;tetrasubstituted alkenes with amino, cyano, and seleno groups. This potassium iodide&#8208;mediated, metal/oxidant&#8208;free protocol features simple operation, high chemoselectivity, and excellent stereoselectivity.

Herein, an electrochemical tandem reaction that integrates acetonitrile self&#8208;coupling with selenylation to construct densely functionalized tetrasubstituted alkenes bearing amino, cyano, and seleno groups from readily available acetonitrile and diselenides is reported. Employing potassium iodide as a redox mediator under mild, metal&#8208;free, and oxidant&#8208;free conditions, this sustainable strategy leverages the synergistic effect of electrochemical oxidation and iodine catalysis to achieve inert C(sp3)&#63743;H bond activation of acetonitrile. The transformation exhibits good stereoselectivity along with substrate scope across diverse aryl and alkyl selenides.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Reduction of &#946;&#8208;Nitroacrylates via Hydrogen Atom Transfer Promoted by Tetrabutylammonium Decatungstate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrabutylammonium decatungstate is hereby applied as efficient photocatalyst for the hydrogenation or deuteration of &#946;&#8208;nitroacrylates via hydrogen atom transfer. The protocol affords the desired products in good yields, with short reaction time, and demonstates a good functional group compatibility.

A photocatalyzed reduction of the C&#63742;C double bond in &#946;&#8208;nitroacrylates under flow conditions is developed. The reaction takes place upon irradiation at 390&#8201;nm in the presence of tetrabutylammonium decatungstate and requires &#947;&#8208;terpinene as a hydrogen source. Products are obtained in good yields, and various functional groups are tolerated, such as unconjugated double bonds, benzyl groups and carbonyls, thus demonstrating a substantial chemoselectivity.

Sonochemical multicomponent synthesis of 2&#8208;(2&#180;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine&#160; analogs with an intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonded eight&#8208;membered ring exhibiting an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer fluorescent process.

Multicomponent reactions are excellent tools to generate complex structures with broad chemical diversity and fluorescent properties. The sonochemical multicomponent one&#8208;pot synthesis of novel organic luminescent heterocycles, such as 2&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine (2&#8208;HPIP) analogs, is described. The Groebke&#8211;Blackburn&#8211;Bienaym&#233; reaction (GBBR) affords good to excellent yields (75&#8211;95%). Notably, the compound 4b forms an intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonded eight&#8208;membered ring (8&#8208;MR) in the crystalline state and is luminescent in this phase; in solution, this compound exhibits dual band emission with a very large Stokes shift of 18&#8201;382&#8201;cm&#8722;1 attributed to an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process. Time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) and additional calculations are performed to evaluate the HOMO&#8211;LUMO distributions and theoretical absorption spectra, being in agreement with the experimental data. Additionally, the TD&#8208;DFT calculations in solution (chloroform) show the ESIPT process and 8&#8208;MR formation become thermodynamically favorable in 4b. This work represents the first synthesis of prompts feasibility ESIPT heterocyclic luminescent materials via an eight&#8208;membered ring (8&#8208;MR) with an N&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#63743;O connection.

Notably, the compound &lt;b&gt;4b&lt;/b&gt; forms an intramolecular hydrogen-bonded eight-membered ring (8-MR) in the crystalline state and is luminescent in this phase; in solution, this compound exhibits dual band emission with a very large Stokes shift of 18&#8201;382&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; attributed to an excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process. Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) and additional calculations are performed to evaluate the HOMO&#8211;LUMO distributions and theoretical absorption spectra, being in agreement with the experimental data. Additionally, the TD-DFT calculations in solution (chloroform) show the ESIPT process and 8-MR formation become thermodynamically favorable in &lt;b&gt;4b&lt;/b&gt;. This work represents the first synthesis of prompts feasibility ESIPT heterocyclic luminescent materials via an eight-membered ring (8-MR) with an N&#183;&#183;&#183;H&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O connection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A (Ru)&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;C&#63743;H sulphonamidation of benzo[b][1,4]oxazin&#8208;2&#8208;ones using sulfonyl azides enables access to diverse sulphonamides in excellent yields. The method features broad substrate scope, high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity, and functional group tolerance, offering a streamlined route to functionalized heterocycles under mild conditions.

This study presents a novel ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed method for the regioselective ortho&#8208;sulphonamidation of benzo[b][1,4]oxazin&#8208;2&#8208;ones. Utilizing sulfonyl azides, which release benign nitrogen gas as a byproduct, this approach achieves high yields and excellent ortho&#8208;selectivity in C&#63743;H functionalization. The protocol exhibits a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and operational simplicity. Optimization studies and control experiments support a plausible reaction mechanism involving a ruthenium&#8208;metallacycle intermediate. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis demonstrates the practicality and potential of the method to access biologically relevant molecules, significantly expanding C&#63743;H functionalization in heterocyclic chemistry.

         <title>Intramolecular Azide&#8211;Alkene Cycloaddition&#8212;The Logothetis Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As originally reported by Logothetis, alkenyl azides cyclize smoothly on warming, leading, depending on substitution, to cyclic imines or bicyclic aziridines. These intermediates can then be carried on to other products. This review summarizes the many ways the Logothetis reaction has been employed in target&#8208;directed synthesis.

The assembly of cyclic amines is fundamental to medicinal chemistry. While intramolecular azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition is widely practiced, intramolecular azide&#8211;alkene cycloaddition is much less used, even though it has been known since 1965. This review is an overview of the applications of intramolecular azide&#8211;alkene cycloaddition in target&#8208;directed synthesis since that time.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Ortho&#8208;Deuteration of Electron&#8208;Deficient N&#8208;Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herin, the metal&#8208;free, selective deuteration of electron&#8208;deficient N&#8208;heteroaromatics is reported using O&#8208;carbamate and carboxamide ortho&#8208;directing groups (DGs), lithium 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide as the base, and D2O as a green source of D+. The substrate scope includes 10 small molecule N&#8208;heteroaromatic compounds and two pharmaceutically relevant synthetic precursors for which the DGs can be manipulated to form chemical libraries of compounds.

Selectively deuterated electron&#8208;deficient N&#8208;containing heteroaromatic systems can enable modulation of metabolism with enhanced therapeutic efficacy in pharmaceuticals and improved properties and stability of functional materials, e.g., imaging dyes, light emitters, and catalysts. Current synthetic approaches to selectively deuterate N&#8208;heteroaromatic rings largely rely on transition metal (TM) catalysts, prone to inducing over&#8208;deuteration while posing several environmental and sustainability concerns and requiring onerous purification to remove metal traces. In this work, an alternative TM&#8208;free approach is reported based on directed ortho metalation, which employs lithium 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide (LiTMP) such as the base and D2O as a green and accessible electrophilic source of deuterium (D). Since the O&#8208;carbamate and carboxamide directing groups (DGs) can be transformed into other functional groups or cross&#8208;coupled with aromatic or aliphatic moieties, this enables a modular approach to synthesize a series of drug analogs, as exemplified by the synthesis of a precursor to momelotinib&#8208;d1&#160;and the key building block pyrimidine&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic&#8208;5&#8208;d1 acid.

         <title>Regiocontrolled Cleavage of Dialkyl Ethers Using Regenerative Borates as a Sustainable Alternative to Boron Trichloride</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of triaryl borates for highly selective ether cleavage is described. The borate is regenerable from the aqueous extract of a previous ether cleavage reaction without repurification, making use of low toxicity boron and phenolic waste. Such strategies for C&#63743;O cleavage are expected to be broadly applicable to synthetic manipulations where management of waste is critical.

Ethers are ubiquitous functional groups in natural products, surfactants, and materials, making them valuable targets for chemical diversification. This report advances a previously reported method utilizing a 1:1 mixture of BBr3 and BCl3 to cleave unsymmetric dialkyl ethers with high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity. In this new protocol, regenerable triaryl borates are used in place of BCl3, offering a more sustainable approach. Importantly, all boron&#8208;containing byproducts from the reaction can be converted back into the triaryl borate, enabling full reagent recovery. The speciation of borate/BBr3 mixtures is monitored by 11B&#8208;NMR and compared to the previously studied BCl3/BBr3 system. Additionally, Design of Experiments (DOE) statistical analysis reveals a correlation between borate Lewis acidity and cleavage selectivity. The triaryl borate regenerated in&#8201;situ from aqueous waste performs comparably to freshly prepared material in subsequent reactions. Overall, this system matches or exceeds the performance of the original BBr3/BCl3 method across a broad range of dialkyl ether substrates.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dibenzofulvenes (DBFs) and 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinones (PQs) are synthesized through a coupling reaction of 2&#8208;bromobiaryl compounds with different ester electrophiles by using the unique reactivity of organolanthanum heterocyclic intermediates. This method features a one&#8208;pot procedure, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, readily available substrates, and the ability to provide direct access to both DBFs and PQs.

Dibenzofulvenes (DBFs) and 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinones (PQs) are valuable biaryl derivatives with unique applications in many fields. The development of their synthetic methods is of great importance in organic synthesis. A one&#8208;pot coupling reaction of 2&#8208;bromobiaryls with ester electrophiles is reported, exploiting the exceptional reactivity of organolanthanum heterocyclic intermediates. The reaction enables precise installation of C&#63742;C and C&#63742;O moieties at the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;positions of biaryl scaffolds, providing convenient access to DBFs and PQs with high efficiency and good substrate availability.

This method features a one-pot procedure, transition-metal-free conditions, readily available substrates, and the ability to provide direct access to both DBFs and PQs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dibenzofulvenes (DBFs) and 9,10-phenanthrenequinones (PQs) are valuable biaryl derivatives with unique applications in many fields. The development of their synthetic methods is of great importance in organic synthesis. A one-pot coupling reaction of 2-bromobiaryls with ester electrophiles is reported, exploiting the exceptional reactivity of organolanthanum heterocyclic intermediates. The reaction enables precise installation of C&#63742;C and C&#63742;O moieties at the 2,2&#8242;-positions of biaryl scaffolds, providing convenient access to DBFs and PQs with high efficiency and good substrate availability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Latent&#8208;Functionality&#8208;Based Synthesis of the Furanoside Motif of Hygromycin A</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A latent functionality strategy is employed to construct the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketone motif within the sugar fragment of hygromycin A through the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of furan. Facile epimerization at the C5 position enables access to both the natural congeners of hygromycin A and structurally modified derivatives for potential medicinal applications.

Hygromycin A, a once&#8208;forgotten antibiotic first isolated in 1953, is recently rediscovered as a novel inhibitor of Lyme disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi. Given the increasing resistance of gut microbes to antibiotic treatments, there is an urgent need for new therapies with novel mechanisms of action. The molecular architecture of hygromycin A, characterized by its fragmented structure, makes it an appealing platform for derivatization. In this study, it develops a latent functionality strategy to introduce the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketone motif into the sugar fragment via the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of furan. The facile epimerization at the C5 position enables a rapid access congeners of hygromycin A. Furthermore, glycosylation with phenol derivatives provides a versatile method for establishing the unique stereogenic center of the furanoside in this class of compounds.

         <title>Tuning Glycosyl Donor Reactivity via Nitroarene Protecting Groups: A Semiarmed Strategy for Selective Glycosylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular strategy reports to tune glycosyl donor reactivity using nitroarene protecting groups. These groups suppress donor reactivity and can be chemically converted into activating groups, enabling a switchable system. This approach broadens the armed&#8211;disarmed glycosylation strategy and allows for efficient, selective oligosaccharide synthesis using precisely controlled donor reactivity.

Herein, a modular strategy for tuning the reactivity of glycosyl donors using nitroarene (NA) protecting groups such as 4&#8208;nitrobenzyl, 4&#8208;nitrobenzoyl, and 4&#8208;nitrophenyl. The electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of the nitro group markedly reduces donor reactivity, enabling selective activation. Notably, these NA groups can be readily transform into electron&#8208;donating pivaloylaminoarene (PA) and methoxycarbonylaminoarene (MCA) groups via nitro reduction followed by acylation or carbamation. This chemical conversion significantly enhances donor reactivity, offering a switchable reactivity platform. Relative reactivity values (RRVs), determined through competitive glycosylation, establish the reactivity trend: NA &lt; arene &lt; PA &lt; MCA. Applying this strategy, an efficient synthesis of a series of disaccharides is achieved, demonstrating its utility in extending the conventional armed&#8211;disarmed approach in glycosylation chemistry.

         <title>Photocatalytic Cyclopropanation of Allenoates with 1,3,4&#8208;Oxadiazolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spirocyclic compounds are key scaffolds in many drugs and other bioactive molecules. While cyclopropanation of allenes is relatively straightforward, synthesis of spirocyclic compounds from these substrates is scarce. We report a photocatalytic, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free cyclopropanation of allenoates with oxadiazolines as carbene precursors . Thioxanthone, serving as an energy transfer catalyst, enables mild reaction conditions and short reaction times.

Spirocyclic compounds are valuable scaffolds in medicinal chemistry and are important components of numerous drugs and other bioactive molecules. Although the cyclopropanation of allenes using typical methods is relatively straightforward, only limited approaches for the synthesis of spirocyclic compounds from allenoates have been reported. Herein, a photocatalytic, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free cyclopropanation of these substrates using oxadiazolines as a source of nucleophilic carbenes is described. The application of thioxanthone as an energy transfer catalyst under violet light irradiation enables the formation of alkylidenecyclopropanes in synthetically useful yields.

         <title>Adding &#8220;Energy&#8221; to Chalcogenophene Chemistry: Electrosynthesis of 2,3,5&#8208;Trisubstituted Selenyl&#8208;Chalcogenophenes and Their Interaction with DNA</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrosynthetic method is developed for synthesizing selenyl&#8208;chalcogenophenes via intramolecular cyclization of (Z)&#8208;chalcogenenynes under mild conditions and without external oxidants. Density functional theory calculations and cyclic voltammetry support the experimental results and help propose plausible mechanistic pathways.

Herein, an efficient and more environmentally benign electrosynthetic approach is reported for the intramolecular chalcogeno cyclization of (Z)&#8208;chalcogenoenynes, resulting in seleno&#8208;chalcogenophene derivatives. The reaction proceeds in an undivided cell in constant current and equipped with platinum electrodes by using 5&#8201;mL of acetonitrile as a solvent, 0.2&#8201;mmol of the (Z)&#8208;chalcogenoenyne, 2 equiv. of diorganoyl diselenide and 0.2 equiv. of electrolyte, 18 overall compounds are synthesized with yields between 52% and 97%. Control experiments and density functional theory studies are also conducted to propose plausible mechanistic pathways. Furthermore, selected compounds are screened via spectrophotometric titration to assess their potential interactions with DNA, with results indicating that both groove and intercalation interactions occure depending on the structure and concentration of the seleno&#8208;chalcogenophene compound. This electrochemical procedure presents itself as a viable and cost&#8208;effective alternative for the synthesis of chalcogenophenes, as it doesn't require external oxidants, operates under mild reaction conditions, and affords its products in good to excellent yields.

         <title>Exhaustive Hydrodechlorination of Trichloroacetamides under Electrochemical Conditions at Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogenation of trichloroacetamides to afford structurally diverse acetamide derivatives is achieved under environmentally benign, mild electrochemical conditions through an iodide&#8208;mediated crucial halogen&#8208;bonding interaction. The reaction mechanism is fully established by control experiments and by in&#8201;situ cyclic voltammetry.

A simple yet efficient electrochemical method is developed for accessing acetamide derivatives from allylic trichloroacetamides derived from the Overman reaction, even though the transformation is synthetically challenging under reductive conditions. The proposed mechanistic pathway of the reaction is fully supported by control experiments and electrochemical studies.

     alt="Exhaustive Hydrodechlorination of Trichloroacetamides under Electrochemical Conditions at Ambient Temperature"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogenation of trichloroacetamides to afford structurally diverse acetamide derivatives is achieved under environmentally benign, mild electrochemical conditions through an iodide-mediated crucial halogen-bonding interaction. The reaction mechanism is fully established by control experiments and by in&#8201;situ cyclic voltammetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple yet efficient electrochemical method is developed for accessing acetamide derivatives from allylic trichloroacetamides derived from the Overman reaction, even though the transformation is synthetically challenging under reductive conditions. The proposed mechanistic pathway of the reaction is fully supported by control experiments and electrochemical studies. Other attractive features, such as inexpensive electrode material and electrolytes, minimal chemical waste, broad substrate scope, consistent yield, operational simplicity, and scalability, make this method appealing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoinduced Copper Catalyzed C(sp2)&#63743;P Bond Formation by Coupling of Diphenylphosphine with Aryl Iodides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced Ullmann&#8208;type C&#63743;P bond&#8208;forming reaction is accomplished at room temperature with no additional ligand. This method features broad substrate scope, scalability, and product transformation.

A photoinduced copper&#8208;catalyzed coupling of diphenylphosphine with aryl halides is reported. This efficient C(sp2)&#63743;P bond formation is realized by blue LED irradiation of a copper(I) catalyst at room temperature with no additional ligand. A variety of sterically demanding and functionalized substrates are applied under mild reaction conditions to provide the corresponding triarylphosphines in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Sustainable Synthesis of Isoxazoles and Isoxazolines Directly from Aldehydes via One&#8208;Pot Metal&#8208;Free Approach Using a Reusable Ionic Liquid [C8DABCO][OH] at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a one&#8208;pot and a multistep approach for the regioselective formation of 3,5&#8208;disubstituted isoxazoles, isoxazolines, and bis&#8208;isoxazoles at room temperature. The metal&#8208;free method enhances product yield, allowing lower catalyst loading, reduced reaction time, and broad substrate tolerance . Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and reusability of the ionic&#8208;liquid underscore its sustainable advantages, reinforcing the efficiency and eco&#8208;friendliness of the protocol.

Isoxazole and isoxazoline derivatives demonstrate versatile therapeutic properties, captivating widespread global attention. Despite the potential benefits of these scaffolds, hurdles such as reliance on cytotoxic and expensive metal catalysts, low productivity, and limited substrate scope impede their effective synthesis. In this work, a 1,4&#8208;Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, based ionic liquid has been developed for the sustainable and eco&#8208;friendly synthesis of isoxazole and isoxazoline derivatives under metal and solvent&#8208;free conditions from chloroaldoximes. The room temperature mediated protocol framed the desired 3,5&#8208;disubstituted and 3,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted compounds, tolerating an array of functionalized and substituted chloroaldoximes, alkynes, and olefins. Moreover, this basic catalytic system even formulates the generation of bis&#8208;isoxazole derivatives and fabricates a one&#8208;pot telescopic strategy for forming the 3,5&#8208;isomer directly from aldehydes. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction done on three of the synthesized compounds confirms the formation of the 3,5&#8208;disubstituted isoxazole and bis&#8208;isoxazole derivatives. In addition, formation of some interesting, unusual products other than the desired isoxazole derivatives provides a new insight into this cycloaddition reaction. The reusability of the catalytic system for up to four consecutive runs and the successful outcome of the gram&#8208;scale reactions illustrate the synthetic efficiency of the protocol.

         <title>Multicomponent Synthesis of Fluorine&#8208;Containing Bioactive Compounds and Drugs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicomponent reactions are robust synthetic tools to assamble complex polyheterocycles and other interesting molecular architectures with potential application in medicinal chemistry, including their fluorine&#8208;containing analogues. Fluorine atoms placed strategically into bioactive molecules often enhance essential pharmacokinetic parameters like bioavailability, lipophilicity and metabolic resistance. Indeed, various marketed drugs contain fluorine atoms in their structures.

It is well known that fluorine atoms placed strategically into bioactive molecules often enhance essential pharmacokinetic parameters like bioavailability, lipophilicity, and metabolic resistance. In the same way, a relatively broad spectrum of marketed drugs contains one or more fluorine atoms in their structures, usually in the form of fluorine&#8208;, difluoromethyl&#8208;, trifluoromethyl&#8208;, or perfluoroalkyl aromatic moieties, being essential parts of their corresponding pharmacophores. Besides, multicomponent reactions (MCR) are highly convergent one&#8208;pot processes in which three or more smartly substituted/functionalized reagents are combined simultaneously, sequentially or consecutively, in the same reactor to assemble complex products (including polyheterocycles) containing most or all atoms from the reagents. Thus, the scope of the present review is to discuss selected MCR&#8208;based works since 2009 for the synthesis of bioactive compounds and drugs that contain at least one fluorine atom in their structures, as well as relevant results from in silico, in&#8201;vitro, and/or in&#8201;vivo studies against a variety of important target biomolecules, highlighting the role of fluorine&#8208;containing moieties.

The exceptionally mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance highlight the utility of this method to prepare privileged motifs from readily available 1,2,3&#8208;thiadiazoles and tertiary &#945;&#8208;carbonyl bromides feedstocks.

         <title>New Approaches in Catalytic Reactions Using Triphos: A Classical Privileged Ligand |</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past decades multiple catalytic transformations have been feasible due to the application of triphos as ligand. Its particular fac coordination mode to a transition metal center provides a suitable flexibility enabling variation on the coordination mode resulting in metal stabilization. Most of the reported catalytic reactions have been dominated by the use of the ruthenium&#8208;triphos system, either by application of well&#8208;defined complexes or the in situ formed complex. However, in the last years the emergence of cobalt complexes with comparable or even superior catalytic performance than ruthenium have been reported. In this review we have focused on the use of triphos in selected reactions such as N&#8208;alkylation, formic acid dehydrogenation and bond cleavage.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Bioorthogonal Mycolic Acids: Chemoselective Reduction of &#946;&#8208;Ketoesters Containing an Alkyne Using the Noyori Catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric reduction of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters using the Noyori catalyst is a highly effective synthetic methodology, offering excellent stereocontrol for the preparation of enantiopure b&#8208;hydroxyesters from prochiral substrates in high yields. This reaction has been used in the total synthesis of mycolic acids, which are &#945;&#8208;alkyl, &#946;&#8208;hydroxy fatty acids forming the main part of the mycobacterial cell outer membrane. Recently, the metabolism of mycobacteria has been explored using the chemical reporter strategy with bioorthogonal analogues or precursors of mycolic acids. Introducing a bioorthogonal alkyne into these compounds is a challenging task and particularly valuable for subsequent probe attachment via click chemistry. This work presents approaches for the synthesis of several alkyne&#8208;containing mycolic acids featuring the native structure of natural mycolic acids. The chemoselectivity of the enantioselective reduction of several b&#8208;ketoesters using the Noyori catalyst in the presence of a protected terminal alkyne group was investigated. Conditions have been optimized to ensure that the alkyne remains intact during the reduction process.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The asymmetric reduction of &#946;-ketoesters using the Noyori catalyst is a highly effective synthetic methodology, offering excellent stereocontrol for the preparation of enantiopure b-hydroxyesters from prochiral substrates in high yields. This reaction has been used in the total synthesis of mycolic acids, which are &#945;-alkyl, &#946;-hydroxy fatty acids forming the main part of the mycobacterial cell outer membrane. Recently, the metabolism of mycobacteria has been explored using the chemical reporter strategy with bioorthogonal analogues or precursors of mycolic acids. Introducing a bioorthogonal alkyne into these compounds is a challenging task and particularly valuable for subsequent probe attachment via click chemistry. This work presents approaches for the synthesis of several alkyne-containing mycolic acids featuring the native structure of natural mycolic acids.

         <title>Point&#8208;to&#8208;axis optical activity induction in extended, sterically congested chromophoric systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The readily available, modular and electronic circular dichroism (ECD)&#8208;silent derivatives of terephthalaldehyde (the probes) have exhibited an induced optical activity upon condensation with chiral primary amines. The central unit of the probe serves as an amine binder by forming imine bonds and is flanked by two extended chromophoric units (&#8220;the wings&#8221;). Modification of the wings by diphenylamine or carbazole units affects the sterical and spectroscopic properties of the probes. An increase in sterical congestion within the probe core resulted in a change in the mechanism of optical activity induction. In the more congested systems, the point&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transmission from the chiral amine (the inducer) to the chromophoric system led to the adaptation of helical conformation by &#8220;the wings&#8221; and the appearance of non&#8208;zero Cotton effects (CEs) in the low&#8208;energy part of the ECD spectrum. However, the sterically congested probes were sensitive to the chirality of the inducers but relatively indifferent to the differences in their structure. Thus, the chirality of the inducers triggers conformational change towards the thermodynamically preferred conformational diastereoisomer due to the probe's &#8212;1 &#8208; +1 operation scheme.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated Silyl Esters and Silyl Phosphonates Over Cyclopropanation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated silyl esters are an important class of compounds in organic, inorganic and pharmaceutical chemistry, known for their versatility and unique reactivity. The conjugated system in these compounds enables for Michael addition reactions, making them useful intermediates in the synthesis of complex organic/inorganic molecules, including pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and natural products. Having realized the importance of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated silyl esters, we have devised a strategy to synthesize various functionalized allyl and vinyl silanes using diazo compounds and respective silanes. Herein we have demonstrated that the allyl and vinyl silanes can react with diazo compounds in a chemoselective manner offering a versatile method for constructing C&#8208;C bond formation over the cyclopropanation reaction in the presence of 1 mol% of [Cp*RuCl2]n as a catalyst under mild conditions. Direct C&#8208;H bond functionalization of allyl and vinyl silanes with alpha diazo esters and phosphonate diazo showcasing the adaptability of silicon&#8208;based chemistry in modern organic synthesis. The plausible mechanism of the reaction has been realized with the help of DFT calculations. All the synthesized &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated siliyl esters were isolated and characterized by using sophisticated analytical and spectroscopic techniques.</dc:description>
