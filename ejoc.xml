         <title>Understanding the Role of Internal Lewis Acids in the Catalytic Activity of Urea&#8208;Based Hydrogen Donors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detailed quantum&#8208;chemical calculations have been carried out to understand both the origin of the catalysis in the urea&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening of nitrocyclopropanes and the acceleration induced by the presence of an internal Lewis acid in the catalyst. To this end, the mode of activation of these ureas is quantitatively analyzed in detail by means of the Activation Strain Model of reactivity in combination with the Energy Decomposition Analysis method. It is found that the presence of the Lewis acid in the urea further enhances the interaction between the reactants, by increasing both the electrostatic and orbital attractions, which translates into a reduced activation barrier. This insight is also used to assess the impact of the nature of the Lewis acid on the transformation, facilitating the rational design of more active catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Adventures in the Chemistry of Multicomponent and Domino Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present article presents a personalized review of multicomponent and domino reactions directed towards the synthesis of complex heterocyclic products. Chemistry includes the combination of Knoevenagel with hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, [3+2] cycloadditions and enamine cyclizations. In addition, various formal [3+3] cyclizations of pyridinium salts and domino [4+2]/retro [4+2] reactions are reported.Web: https://langer.chemie.uni&#8208;rostock.de







Abstract
The present personalized account summarizes various cyclization reactions, including multicomponent and domino processes, which are directed towards the synthesis of complex heterocyclic products. Domino Knoevenagel/hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions provide a synthesis of annulated quinol&#8208;2&#8208;ones. The combination of Knoevenagel reactions with [3+2] cycloadditions of nitrogen ylides afford complex spiroheteriocyclic products. Domino Knoevenagel/enamine cyclization reactions result in the formation of condensed purine analogues. Formal [3+3] cyclizations of pyridinium salts allow for a rapid assembly of bridged heterocyclic systems and include the employment of thioxindoles and cyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones as dinucleophilic building blocks. The formal [3+3] cyclization of thioxindoles with fluoroaroyl chlorides, such as 2&#8208;fluorobenzoyl chlorides and 2&#8208;chloropyridine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic chloride, give rise to the synthesis of condensed benzothiophenes. The cyclization of heterocyclic enamines with diimines and triazines afford various purine analogues by domino [4+2]/retro [4+2] reactions. The formal [3+3] cyclization of 2,4,6&#8208;tris(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine with 1,3&#8208;bis(silyloxy)&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadienes afford, depending on the conditions, 2,6&#8208;bis(trifluoromethy)pyrid&#8208;4&#8208;ones or triazaadamantanone derivatives. Heating of 2&#8208;ethynylpyridines with electron&#8208;rich dienes afforded 2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyphenyl)pyridines by a domino [4+2]/retro [4+2] process. The reaction of 2&#8208;ethynylpyridines with enones afforded indolizines by a formal [3+3] cyclization. The reaction of trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;diketones with lithiated alkynes afforded 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;pent&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ones. Formal [5+1] cyclization of the latter with urea afforded trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted pyridines. The Pd catalyzed formal [3+2] cyclizations of 2,3&#8208;dihalopyridines with imines afforded a series of regioisomeric 4&#8208; and 7&#8208;azaindoles.

         <title>Bimetallic Ru(II) Complex Catalysed &#946;&#8208;Alkylation of Secondary Alcohols and &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Ketones: Selective Formation of Saturated Ketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudo&#8208;C2 symmetric Ru(II) catalysts (Cat2 and Cat3) offer an efficient and practical route to &#945;&#8208;alkylated saturated ketones through either &#946;&#8208;alkylation of secondary alcohols or &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones, with high selectivity and scalability for small catalyst loadings.







Abstract
Ru(II) bimetallic [(p&#8208;cymene)2(RuCl)2L1]2X (X=BF4 (Cat2); X=PF6 (Cat3)) and monometallic [(p&#8208;cymene)(RuCl)L2]BF4 (Cat4) (where L1=N,N&#8217;&#8208;(3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetraisopropyl&#8208;[1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8208;diyl)bis(1&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanimine); L2=N&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;phenyl)&#8208;1&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;methanimine) catalyse selective synthesis of saturated ketones using &#946;&#8208;alkylation of secondary alcohol or &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones with primary alcohol. Notably, a single catalyst facilitates the oxidation of both secondary and primary alcohols followed by condensation and hydrogenation yielding &#945;&#8208;alkylated saturated ketones. Remarkably, this system allows catalyst loading as low as 0.01&#8197;mol% for &#946;&#8208;alkylation of secondary alcohols and 0.005&#8197;mol% for the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketone, delivering access to a wide array of &#945;&#8208;alkylated ketones derivatives with yields of ~97&#8201;%. Complex Cat2, in particular, orchestrates one&#8208;pot alkylation reactions with a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 5.6

105&#8197;h&#8722;1 using as low as low catalyst loading of 0.0001&#8197;mol%. A comparative study between bimetallic and monometallic complexes reveals that complex Cat2 exhibits better selectivity for the formation of saturated ketones presumably owing to a cooperative effect between the metal centres. The scale&#8208;up synthesis highlights the practical applicability of the catalytic approach. To delve into the plausible mechanisms, we conducted initial investigations through meticulously controlled experiments and spectroscopic analysis.

A new N, N, N&#8217;, N&#8217;&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;para&#8208;phenylenediamine, where all the phenyl rings are tethered by four oxygen atoms so as to adopt a quasi&#8208;planar conformation, has been synthesized.

Abstract
A quasi&#8208;planar N, N, N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;para&#8208;phenylenediamine, where all the phenyl rings are tethered by four oxygen atoms to embed quasi&#8208;planar triphenylamine moieties into the molecular skeleton, was prepared and characterized to evaluate the impact by incorporating the structural rigidity. The monocationic and dicationic species could be selectively generated, depending on the type of oxidizing agents used. Spectroscopic and X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses revealed the radical cation was in a unique charge/spin delocalized class&#8197;III mixed&#8208;valence state due to an exquisite balance between the electronic effect by the oxygen&#8208;bridges and the rigidity of molecular framework.

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Catenanes Platformed with meso&#8208;Arylporphyrin</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 22, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Padlock&#8221; structures comprising cyclodextrin (CD) catenanes were successfully constructed using a strong intermolecular interaction of CD with meso&#8208;arylporphyrin in water. A water soluble Grubbs's catalyst was used for interlocking CD onto the porphyrin. The novel catenane compounds were useful to elucidate the highly specific intermolecular interactions of methylated CD to meso&#8208;(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl)porphyrins in water.







Abstract
Among mechanically interlocked supramolecular systems with cyclodextrins (CDs), successful examples of CD&#8208;based catenanes are limited compared to a number of CD rotaxanes owing to the synthetic difficulties. We herein demonstrate an efficient synthesis of a CD&#8208;based catenane using a meso&#8208;arylporphyrin (Por) platform. Using Por modified with two olefin&#8208;terminated oxyethylene chains at the cis&#8208;meso&#8208;positions, an interlocked Por&#8208;CD catenane was synthesized via olefin metathesis in the presence of per&#8208;O&#8208;methylated &#946;&#8208;CD (TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD) in water. The novel Por&#8208;CD catenane was obtained in 30&#8201;% isolated yield, which was characterized by MALDI&#8208;TOF mass and NMR spectroscopies. In the latter part, we demonstrate determination of the binding constants between TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD and meso&#8208;(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin using Por&#8208;CD catenane, 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD (DMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD), and 13C&#8208;labeled TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD (13C&#8208;TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD). The host&#8208;guest exchange reaction from the Por&#8208;CD catenane/DMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD to the Por&#8208;CD catenane/TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD complexes was directly monitored through 1D HMQC spectroscopy. The ratio of these complexes revealed the difference in the binding affinities of DMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD and TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD to Por. The stable 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 inclusion complex between meso&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin (TPPS) and TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD has been well&#8208;studied for many years. This study is the first to determine the respective binding constants, K1 and K2, using the model system, to be 3.0&#215;107&#8197;M&#8722;1 and 3.4&#215;107&#8197;M&#8722;1, respectively.

         <title>Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 Compound&#8208;Activated DMSO: An Efficient Oxidizing Reagent to Convert Alcohols to Ketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 22, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
When high&#8208;valent Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 compounds meet DMSO, a unique platform is set up to manipulate sulfonium chemistry. A case study of oxidation of alcohols to ketones is shown herein. Crucial trifluoromethoxysulfonium is initially generated, and reacts with alcohols to give new alkoxysulfonium species via ligand exchange. Subsequent base&#8208;promoted E2 elimination gives ketones with the release of Me2S.







Abstract
In this study high&#8208;valent Cu(III) trifluoromethyl compounds in combination with DMSO is shown to be an efficient and mild oxidizing system for the conversion of alcohols to ketones (aldehydes as well). Trifluoromethoxylated sulfonium species is proposed to be initially formed that engages in crucial steps of alkoxy replacement at sulfonium center and deprotonative collapse of the resulting alkoxysulfonium intermediate in the presence of a base. This reaction is highly selective without over&#8208;oxidation, and can tolerate a broad range of functional groups owing to mild oxidizing ability of the Cu(III)&#8208;CF3/DMSO system and the inert N2 conditions. This method can be applied to the synthesis and functionalization of commercial drug compounds. This study illustrates an unusual reactivity property of high&#8208;valent Cu(III) trifluoromethyl compounds beyond the conventional CF3 group transfer reactivity, and opens up new opportunities for developing novel reactions of Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 compounds. The combined use of high&#8208;valent Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 compound and DMSO is anticipated to find more applications to develop other novel and useful oxidation reactions.

An organic&#8208;superbase&#8208;catalyzed glutamation of phenols, thiophenols, secondary amines and imides has been realized through Michael addition between &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters and benzophenone&#8208;imines of glycine esters. 3&#8208;Substituted glutamic acid esters were obtained in excellent yields and diastereoselectivities (up to quantitative yield and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr) in THF by using LiBr as an additive at room temperature.

1,8&#8208;Diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene (DBU) catalyzed Michael addition reactions between &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters and benzophenone&#8208;imines of glycine esters have been realized in THF at room temperature by using LiBr as an additive, effectively enabling the glutamation of phenols, thiophenols, secondary amines and imides. 3&#8208;Substituted glutamic acid esters were obtained in excellent yields and diastereoselectivities (up to quantitative yield and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr). These glutamic acid esters were readily converted into their corresponding pyroglutamic acid esters in high yields through acidic hydrolysis followed by lactamization.

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Naturally Occurring Cyclic Tetrapeptide JM&#8208;47and Analogues through Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of a Common Scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 22, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular protocol for the total synthesis of naturally occurring cyclic tetrapeptide JM&#8208;47 and analogues has been developed and features cross&#8208;metathesis&#8208;based diversification of a macrocyclic scaffold. The synthesis proceeds in good overall yields and with high stereochemical integrity.







Abstract
A unified approach to access the naturally occurring cyclic tetrapeptide JM&#8208;47 and some of its structural variants from a common macrocyclic scaffold has been developed. The key reactions involved a difficult macrocyclization to access the scaffold, and its late&#8208;stage diversification by cross&#8208;metathesis to access the natural product as well as analogues. The synthesis proceeded in good overall yield and high stereochemical integrity. It also confirms the structure and configuration assigned to JM&#8208;47.

         <title>Synthesis of Noncoded Amino Acids Bearing a Salicylaldehyde Tag for the Design of Reversible&#8208;Covalent Peptides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 22, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the design and synthesis of two novel noncoded &#945;&#8208;amino acids, incorporating a lysine&#8208;engaging salicylaldehyde tag on the side chain. These key building blocks open to the versatile positioning of the electrophile tag within peptide sequences, enabling tailored design of reversible&#8208;covalent peptide binders for clinically&#8208;relevant proteins.

Insertion of electrophilic species on the structure of small molecule ligands or peptides is a well&#8208;known strategy to increase their binding affinity for the target protein of interest. Among these reactive units, the salicylaldehyde (SA) tag can form remarkably stable imine bonds with the &#1013;&#8208;amino group of lysine, a highly frequent residue in proteins. In this work, we describe the optimized synthesis of two new noncoded &#945;&#8208;amino acids, starting from l&#8208;homoserine and featuring the SA tag on the side chain. One of these final compounds was successfully inserted into a model tripeptide through in&#8208;solution synthesis. These building blocks will allow the versatile insertion of the SA tag at suitable position of peptide sequences, opening to a tailored design of Lys&#8208;engaging peptide ligands.

         <title>Heteroaryl 2&#8208;Sulfonamide Synthesis by SN2 Reaction&#8211;Oxidation Cascade</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 22, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient SN2&#8208;oxidation cascade reaction for synthesizing heteroaryl 2&#8208;sulfonamides from disulfanes and amines is described. The methodology has broad scope, affording heteroaryl 2&#8208;sulfonamides in moderate to good yields, and was applied to the synthesis of H3B&#8208;968, a potential Werner Syndrome Protein (WRN) small molecule inhibitor.







Abstract
Heteroaryl 2&#8208;sulfonamides are an important structural moiety in drug discovery. However, reports of the efficient synthesis of these scaffolds are rare. Herein we disclose new reaction conditions to synthesize heteroaryl 2&#8208;sulfonamides from disulfanes and amines through an SN2&#8208;oxidation cascade. The approach is compatible with a wide variety of heteroaryl and amine substrates and can be conducted on a gram scale. A potential Werner Syndrome Protein (WRN) small molecule inhibitor H3B&#8208;968 was also synthesized by this method.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Enabling Cyanation of Electron&#8208;poor Carbons with Acetone Cyanohydrin</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 22, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein is reported an electrochemical procedure based on the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction of acetone cyanohydrin at a Pt cathode enabling the cyanation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208; unsaturated carbonyl and imines. Catalytic current, along with a correspondingly reduced quantity of supporting electrolyte, facilitates the scalability of the procedure, ensuring brief electrolysis times while maintaining a simple electrochemical design.







Abstract
The Pt&#8208;cathode hydrogen evolution reaction (Pt&#8208;HER) of acetone cyanohydrin provides an alternative method for introducing the cyano group onto electrophilic carbons of imines and chalcones. The synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles and &#946;&#8208;cyano ketones has been achieved smoothly with a small excess of cyanating agent (2 equivalent), catalytic amount of supporting electrolyte and low electricity consumption (0.02&#8197;F/mol). Besides demonstrating a general atom economy, the high Faradaic efficiency, allows for a scale&#8208;up with low&#8208;demanding electrochemical design and short electrolysis times.

         <title>Hexafluoroisopropanol Promoted Ring&#8208;Opening&#8208;Cyclization of Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropanes with Primary Amines</title>

A metal&#8208;free, ring&#8208;opening&#8208;cyclization reaction of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes with primary amines is reported with HFIP.







Abstract
We reveal here a catalyst&#8208;free, ring&#8208;opening&#8208;cyclization of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes with primary amines to synthesize functionalized dihydropyrroles. This protocol avoids inert conditions and solvents promoted by hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP). The reaction is quite general with aryl, alkyl, and alicyclic amines. A good number of cyclopropanes bearing keto groups reacted excellently to produce the desired products. Further, we complemented this method with Meldrum's acid&#8208;derived cyclopropanes for synthesizing &#947;&#8208;lactams. We have demonstrated the post&#8208;synthetic applications of the products and gram&#8208;scale synthesis to highlight the adaptability of this synthetic protocol.

The total synthesis of pyranicin and 4&#8208;epi&#8208;pyranicin has been accomplished from carbohydrate precursors. The general synthetic strategy includes two main fragment formations: (1) THP fragment (2) Butenolide fragment.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a simple and efficient pathway for the total synthesis of pyranicin and 4&#8208;epi&#8208;pyranicin by utilizing carbohydrates as chiral raw materials for the first time. The general synthetic strategy involves the formation of two main fragments: Fragment 1 is the central tetrahydropyran core, which was constructed in a total of 10 steps from 2,3,4,6&#8208;tetra&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl D&#8208;glucal via Ferrier&#8208;type rearrangement and oxidative cyclization as the key steps. Fragment 2 is the butenolide fragment, which was obtained in a gram scale with a total of 14 steps from diacetyl&#8208;L&#8208;rhamnal involving a ring contraction strategy.

A photo&#8208;induced Minisci&#8211;type cyanoalkylation of azauracils and cyclobutanone oxime esters was developed under metal&#8208;free and base&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
A photo&#8208;induced Minisci&#8211;type cyanoalkylation of azauracils was developed under metal&#8208;free and base&#8208;free conditions. Readily available cyclobutanone oxime esters were used as the cyanoalkylating reagents via C&#8722;C bond cleavage to generate the &#947;&#8208;cyanoalkyl azauracil derivatives in good to moderate yields. The introduced cyano group can be easily converted into many other functional groups, thus makes current protocol more practical.

         <title>Decatungstate&#8208;Photocatalyzed Diastereoselective Dearomative Hydroalkylation of Indoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 22, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates an efficient dearomative hydroalkylation of indoles using alkanes or ethers as alkyl radical sources and TBADT as a cost&#8208;effective photocatalyst for direct hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). Successful conversion of these heterocyclic derivatives into 2&#8208;alkylindolines with good to excellent yields and high diastereoselectivity is achieved under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
In this study, we present an efficient and straightforward dearomative hydroalkylation of indoles. By utilizing alkanes or ethers as alkyl radical sources and employing TBADT as a cost&#8208;effective photocatalyst for direct hydrogen atom transfers (HAT), we achieved successful conversion of these heterocyclic derivatives into 2&#8208;alkylindolines with good to excellent yields and high diastereoselectivity under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Direct and Stereoselective Protecting&#8208;Group&#8208;Free N&#8208;ADP&#8208;Ribosylation through Traceless Staudinger Ligation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 22, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct and &#945;&#8208;selective protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free N&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylation through traceless Staudinger ligation is successfully developed. The stereoselectivity of this protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free N&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylation is comfirmed by an enzymatic degradation experiment and HPLC analysis using synthetic standards. This method enables the facile and rapid synthesis of N&#8208;linked ADP&#8208;ribosyl molecules with complete &#945;&#8208;selectivity and moderate yields.







Abstract
Adenine diphosphate (ADP)&#8208;ribosylation catalyzed by bacterial toxins is the addition of an ADP&#8208;ribose moiety to specific amino acid residues in target proteins such as arginine, asparagine, glutamine, and histidine through 1,2&#8208;cis(&#945;)&#8208;glycosidic bond formation. ADP&#8208;ribosylation modifies host cell functions, altering normal cellular processes to facilitate their survival, and replication. Despite the development of click chemistry and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis&#8208;based approaches, the synthesis of structurally well&#8208;defined naturally occurring N&#8208;linked ADP&#8208;ribosyl molecules remains challenging. Herein, we report a direct and &#945;&#8208;selective N&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylation using unprotected &#946;&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosyl azide and triphenylphosphine esters through traceless Staudinger ligation. The stereoselectivity of this protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free N&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylation was validated by enzymatic degradation experiment and high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography, referencing synthetic standards. This method facilitated the facile and rapid synthesis of N&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosyl acetamide, biotin, fluorescent dye, amino acids, and tripeptide with complete &#945;&#8208;selectivity and moderate yields (37&#8211;55&#8201;%).

         <title>Novel Imidazole&#8208;based Hydrazonoyl Cyanides and Amidrazones Containing N(N,O)&#8208;Heterocycles: Selective Synthesis, Reaction Mechanisms and Preliminary Anticancer Evaluation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 22, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel imidazole&#8208;based hydrazonoyl cyanides and amidrazones containing morpholine, piperidine and N&#8208;methylpiperazine heterocycles were obtained by two competitive pathways, starting from the same imidazole precursors and corresponding heterocycloalkylhydrazines. These imidazoles provide convenient synthetic precursors to a vast array of heterocycles with pharmaceutical applications. The compounds were screened against colorectal cancer cell line HCT116&#8208;p53 wt and significant IC50 values were obtained.







Abstract
Two series of novel hybrid heterocyclic compounds that combine the imidazole ring with bioactive piperidine, morpholine or piperazine heterosystems, through a hydrazone unit, were easily obtained by two competitive pathways. Starting from 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoformimidoyl imidazoles and 1&#8208;aminopiperidine, 4&#8208;aminomorpholine or 1&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;methylpiperazine under mild acidic media led to the selective synthesis of 5&#8208;aminoimidazole 4&#8208;carboxamidrazones, whereas the corresponding 4&#8208;hydrazonoyl cyanide derivatives were obtained under stronger acidic conditions. These highly functionalized imidazoles provide convenient synthetic precursors to a vast array of heterocycles with potential pharmaceutical applications. The reaction mechanisms were elucidated on the basis of experimental assays and in silico calculations. The compounds were screened against colorectal cancer HCT116&#8208;p53 wt cell line, and significant IC50 values of 3.69&#8197;&#956;M and 4.83&#8197;&#956;M were obtained.

         <title>Practical and Selective Syntheses of S&#8208;Acyl and N&#8208;Acyl Glutathiones with N&#8208;Acyl Imidazoles in Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 22, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a simple and efficient glutathione acylation reaction for the chemoselective synthesis of S&#8208; or N&#8208;acylated glutathione derivatives, under mild conditions and using water as the solvent, by means of the in&#8208;situ formation of acyl imidazole electrophiles from the respective abundant carboxylic acid.







Abstract
A selective, mild, convenient, and green protocol for the preparation of S&#8208;acyl and N&#8208;acyl glutathiones is described involving the chemical modification of glutathione (GSH) with N&#8208;acyl imidazoles at room temperature in water. The syntheses of S&#8208;acyl glutathiones were achieved in very high yields using 1 equiv. of an N&#8208;acyl imidazole in water at room temperature, without the need of a base. Double acylation of GSH with various N&#8208;acyl imidazoles in weakly basic aqueous media in the presence of N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (HOSu) as the activating reagent followed by selective deprotection of the S&#8208;acyl group with aqueous ammonia at room temperature gave high yields of N&#8208;acyl glutathiones. Moreover, the reaction could accommodate a diverse range of carboxylic acids such as (hetero)benzoic acids, phenylacetic acids, aliphatic acids from short&#8208;chain fatty acids (including acetic acid), long&#8208;chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, secondary or tertiary amino acids, and carboxylic acids containing clickable functional groups, fluorescent probes, or drugs.

         <title>Front Cover: Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Catenanes Platformed with meso&#8208;Arylporphyrin (Eur. J. Org. Chem. 22/2024)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 22, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover represents cyclodextrin&#8208;based catenane synthesis using porphyrin&#8208;platform bearing ring&#8208;closable side chains. First cyclodextrin was locked on one arm, then another cyclodextrin could approach from other side of the porphyrin, forming heteromeric supramolecular structures.

The Cover Feature shows a hypothetical arrangement of eight molecules of centrohexaindane (C41H24) with their six mutually orthogonal indane wings stretched along the edges of a cube. The 12 peripheral arene positions, colored in blue and red, can be functionalized in various ways and should allow us to construct of a large variety of novel, centrohexaindane&#8208;based polyaromatic covalently or metal&#8208;coordinated 3D aggregates and networks. The beauty and many&#8208;sidedness of centrohexaindane is presented to inspire multifaceted extension of its chemistry. More information can be found in the Perspective Article by D. Kuck (DOI: 10.1002/ejoc.202400173).

         <dc:description>
Multiple functionalization of the unique three&#8208;dimensional framework of centrohexaindane is discussed in terms of known and yet unknown substitution patterns at the molecular periphery. The potential to employ centrohexaindane derivatives for various molecular extensions in the 3&#8208;space, including the generation of three&#8208;dimensional organic networks based on the C17&#8208;centrohexaquinacene motif, is addressed as a perspective.







Abstract
Centrohexaindane (C41H24), a structurally unique polyaromatic hydrocarbon bearing six mutually fused indane wings stretched out along the Cartesian axes of space, may be viewed as a seed for the construction of covalent and supramolecular three&#8208;dimensional frameworks. A kaleidoscope of established and yet&#8208;to&#8208;be&#8208;explored aspects of centrohexaindane chemistry is presented in this article. After addressing some ideas about the naked centrohexacyclic (and topologically nonplanar) C17&#8208;core, which can be considered a &#8220;centrohexaquinacyne&#8221;, the diversity of known but mostly unknown functionalization patterns at the framework of centrohexaindane is addressed in increasing order of substitution at the twelve equivalent peripheral positions. The variety of centrohexaindanes bearing three identical groups is displayed including a very first access to a centrohexaindane that bears a C3&#8208;symmetrically functionalized tribenzotriquinacene (TBTQ) unit and, thus, a potential for 3D oligocondensation. The diversity of known tetra&#8208; and hexasubstituted centrohexaindane derivatives is presented and conceivable synthesis strategies are discussed for even more highly functionalized derivatives. Finally, the successful access to centrohexaindanes with exhaustive functionalization and hydrocarbon extension at the twelve peripheral positions completes this overview on what may be a vastly open field, still.

         <title>(Radio)Fluorination Reactions for the Synthesis of Aryl Fluorides: Recent Advances and Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of carbon&#8208;fluorine (C&#8208;F) bonds is an important research field in organic synthesis because the insertion of a fluorine atom into an organic compound can alter its physicochemical properties, such as metabolic stability and permeability. Due to this unique property, organic fluorinated compounds, especially aryl fluorides, have a wide range of applications in various fields, including agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and materials science. Therefore, numerous metal&#8208; or metal&#8208;free&#8208;mediated fluorination reactions have been developed to synthesize aryl fluorides. In this mini&#8208;review, we summarize recent ten years&#8217; advances in fluorination reactions for the synthesis of aryl fluorides.</dc:description>

         <title>Topological Structural Chemistry of Fused Bicycloalkanes Allowing Homeomorphic Conversions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fused bicycloalkanes have several structures with different orientations of the substituents, such as out,out&#8208;, in,in&#8208;, and in,out&#8208;structures. Some bicycloalkanes can undergo homeomorphic conversions between out,out&#8208; and in,in&#8208;structures, as well as between in,out&#8208; and out,in&#8208;structures. This homeomorphism can be achieved by one chain passing through the macro ring. In this report, the topological structural chemistry of these compounds was reviewed.







Abstract
Fused bicycloalkanes have several structures with different orientations of the substituents, such as out,out&#8208;, in,in, and in,out&#8208;structures. Some bicycloalkanes can undergo homeomorphic conversions between certain structures, for instance an out,out&#8208;structure can convert to an in,in&#8208;structure. This homeomorphism can be achieved by one chain passing through the macroring. In this report, topological structural chemistry of fused bicycloalkanes and their analogues allowing homeomorphic conversions were reviewed. Although the concept of homeomorphism in fused bicycloalkanes was proposed 50&#8197;years ago, comprehensive research on their structural chemistry is still ongoing. These understandings are highly relevant to the fundamentals of many fields of chemistry, including structural chemistry, theoretical chemistry, natural products chemistry, and materials science.

         <title>Streamlined Electrochemical Dihalogenation (F, Cl, and Br) of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes Using Hydrogen Halides as Reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Catalytic Hydroxyethylation of Phenols with Renewable Ethylene Glycol Diester as an Alternative to Ethylene Oxide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed, solvent&#8208;free hydroxyethylation strategy that converts phenols into phenoxyethanol esters is reported. Ethylene glycol diesters are used as renewable and safe alternatives to the harmful ethylene oxide. Oligomerization byproducts from ethylene oxide are also avoided. Applications are demonstrated in upcycling of polyester plastics and preparation of bioactive chemicals.







Abstract
Polyol esters are abundant bio&#8208;based resources. Integration of polyol esters into the production chain of fine chemicals would reduce carbon emissions and improve the sustainability of the chemical industry. An efficient synthetic route to phenoxyethanols was developed through catalytic hydroxyethylation of phenols with ethylene glycol diacetate as the reagent. This method showed the potential of ethylene glycol diester as a safe and sustainable substitute for ethylene oxide, a useful but toxic reagent. A variety of phenoxyethanol esters were produced in high yield under simple catalytic conditions. Mechanistic studies revealed that the reaction underwent a neighboring group participation process.

         <title>Effect of Tether Length on endo/exo Stereoselectivity in Alkene&#8211;Arene meta&#8208;Photocycloaddition Reactions towards the Aphidocolin/Stemodin Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular alkene&#8208;arene meta&#8208;photocycloaddition reactions are powerful &#8216;reagentless&#8217; transformations that form complex three&#8208;dimensional fused&#8208;ring systems from readily accessible starting materials. By judicious tether design in combination with continuous flow it is demonstrated that substrates with a four&#8208;membered tether can also undergo meta&#8208;photocycloaddition in good yield, enabling access to natural product skeletons.







Abstract
Intramolecular alkene&#8208;arene meta&#8208;photocycloadditions are powerful transformations that use the enhanced reactivity of photoexcited benzene rings to facilitate addition of an alkene 1,3 across donor groups and form complex three&#8208;dimensional fused&#8208;ring systems from readily accessible starting materials. Intramolecular examples have traditionally been restricted to three&#8208;membered tethers, with cycloaddition resulting from exo&#8208;conformation. However, by judicious tether design we have demonstrated that a four&#8208;membered tether can also proceed in good yield; interestingly, via an endo exciplex (1.2&#8201;:&#8201;1) enabling access to both natural product skeletons and interesting scaffolds for medicinal chemistry research.

         <title>Modular Access to Tetrasubstituted N&#8722;H Pyrroles by Catalytic 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of Azomethine Ylides and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Ynones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrasubstituted N&#8722;H pyrroles were accessed through the tandem copper(II)&#8208;catalyzed 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;ynones and glycine iminoesters, followed by a copper(II)&#8208;promoted oxidative dehydrogenative aromatization reaction in air. Fully substituted pyrroles could then be obtained by N&#8208;alkylation.







Abstract
The development of efficient synthetic strategies for the preparation of tetrasubstituted N&#8722;H pyrrole derivatives, especially in an environmentally benign fashion is important yet challenging. Herein, we report a copper(II)&#8208;catalyzed tandem reaction involving 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;ynones and glycine iminoesters, followed by copper(II)&#8208;promoted oxidative (air) dehydrogenative aromatization, allowing de novo access to tetrasubstituted N&#8722;H pyrroles in up to 81&#8201;% yield under green reaction conditions. A possible reaction pathway is tentatively proposed. Finally, fully substituted pyrroles are available by N&#8208;alkylation, and a preliminary phase&#8208;transfer catalytic asymmetric N&#8208;alkylation was also studied to give an axially chiral pyrrole.

         <title>Multicomponent Tandem Cyclization/Aromatization Reaction: Access to 2&#8208;Substituted Naphthothiazoles and Benzothiazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multicomponent tandem cyclization and aromatization approach is introduced for the synthesis of naphthothiazoles and benzothiazoles from &#945;&#8208;tetralones and cyclohexenones, respectively. Styrene derivatives were employed to generate one&#8208;carbon synthons through C=C bond cleavage, while an ammonium salt served as the nitrogen source and elemental sulfur served both as the sulfur source and oxidant.







Abstract
A straightforward, metal&#8208;free multicomponent tandem cyclization/aromatization approach for the synthesis of naphthothiazoles and benzothiazoles is described. This method employs &#945;&#8208;tetralones and cyclohexenones as the starting materials, styrene derivatives as a one&#8208;carbon synthon, an ammonium salt as the N source, elemental sulfur as the S source and an oxidant. This approach offers a broad substrate scope, including &#945;&#8208;tetralones and cyclohexenones adorned with different functional groups, resulting in moderate to high yields of the desired products.

         <title>Fusion of Cyclohepta[def]fluorene Units: Toward Synthesis of High&#8208;Spin Non&#8208;Benzenoid Nanographenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;benzenoid diradicaloid (1) with a triplet ground state was designed by fusing two cyclohepta[def]fluorene units onto one benzene ring. Our synthetic attempts towards 1 involve both oxidation and reduction pathways. In the oxidation path, partially dehydrogenated products 1+H and 1+2H containing an indeno[1,2&#8208;b]fluorene core were obtained. In the reduction path, a new tetraketone precursor (9) with two pairs of pentagons and heptagons was afforded.







Abstract
Non&#8208;benzenoid diradicaloids possessing high&#8208;spin ground states are attractive synthetic targets given their high potential for spintronics and quantum computing. Nevertheless, the synthesis of such compounds remains highly challenging due to their inherent instability. In this work, we present the synthetic attempt towards creating a non&#8208;benzenoid diradicaloid (1) with a triplet ground state by fusing two cyclohepta[def]fluorene units onto a benzene ring. Our synthetic approach involves both oxidation and reduction pathways. In the oxidation path, we obtained the partially dehydrogenated products 1+H and 1+2H containing an indeno[1,2&#8208;b]fluorene core from the tetrahydro precursor (2). However, further dehydrogenation to afford the target molecule (1) did not proceed. On the other hand, with the reduction pathway, a novel tetraketone precursor (9) with two pairs of pentagons and heptagons was successfully synthesized. The subsequent nucleophilic attack however was proved to be difficult probably due to the unselective nucleophilic addition on the zigzag nanographene ketones. Furthermore, UV&#8208;vis absorption, cyclic voltammetry, and theoretical calculations were conducted to explore the optical, electrochemical properties, and aromaticity of all the obtained molecules (1+H, 1+2H and 9). Although the desired target 1 is not achieved, our work provides insight into designing novel high&#8208;spin non&#8208;benzenoid NGs based on nonalternant cyclohepta[def]fluorene system.

&lt;p&gt;Non-benzenoid diradicaloid (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) with a triplet ground state was designed by fusing two cyclohepta[def]fluorene units onto one benzene ring. Our synthetic attempts towards &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; involve both oxidation and reduction pathways.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-benzenoid diradicaloids possessing high-spin ground states are attractive synthetic targets given their high potential for spintronics and quantum computing. Nevertheless, the synthesis of such compounds remains highly challenging due to their inherent instability. In this work, we present the synthetic attempt towards creating a non-benzenoid diradicaloid (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) with a triplet ground state by fusing two cyclohepta[&lt;i&gt;def&lt;/i&gt;]fluorene units onto a benzene ring. Our synthetic approach involves both oxidation and reduction pathways.

         <dc:description>
An efficient direct C(sp3)&#8722;H (hetero)arylation of of 5H&#8208;imidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoindole scaffolds with arylbromides is described under Pd catalysis affording a wide range of the corresponding arylated compounds on the benzylic position in good yields. This methodology was applied to prepare a neurotransmitter Neuropeptide S antagonist analog illustrating that this methodology can be used for the late stage functionalization to obtain molecules of interest.







Abstract
The study of Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond arylation of methyl 5H&#8208;imidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoindole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates with aryl bromides is reported. This methodology gives ready access to a wide range of methyl 5H&#8208;imidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoindole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates that are monoarylated at their benzylic sites. The C(sp3)&#8722;H bond arylation methodology is driven by regioselectivity under weakly basic conditions avoiding remarkably side C(sp2)&#8722;H poly&#8208;arylation of the (hetero)aromatic unit. The process was applied to the preparation of novel imidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoindole&#8208;based neurotransmitter Neuropeptide S antagonist analog.

         <title>Mixed Liquid and Solid Phase Synthesis of Isopeptidic Desferrioxamine Analogues for Complexation of Zirconium</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>89Zr has a number of advantageous properties for PET&#8208;imaging, but optimal chelators for its widespread clinical application still need to be found. Tetrahydroxamates derived from the natural siderophore DFOB are promising candidates in this context. This study describes a solid&#8208;phase approach to isopeptide analogs of DFOB (termed ipDFO*) with four hydroxamate groups for stable Zr(IV)&#8208;chelation. The route uses either commercial or easily available Fmoc&#8208;protected precursors and allows the synthesis of ipDFO* and clickable AZA&#8208;ipDFO* derivatives in only a few hours. The solid&#8208;phase synthesis reduces the workload for the synthesis of ipDFO* and AZA&#8208;ipDFO* derivatives thus significantly compared to a previous multistep solution synthesis. The route is also modular and allows the synthesis of various ipDFO* derivatives with variation in the spacer length between the hydroxamate groups. This spacing is a critical parameter for finding the optimal chelator for hard metal cations like Zr(IV). It might thus help to speed up the search for an ideal Zr&#8208;chelator for PET&#8208;imaging and might also allow the extension to other metal cations of different size.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The most challenging aspect of chemical synthesis has always been attainment of high chemoselectivity levels. This review will provide a panoramic view on how the innate reactivity of two nearly reactive functional groups (&#8208;O/&#8208;N) can be controlled or reversed for the chemoselective functionalisation in alkanolamines. A comprehensive compilation of reports encasing various methodologies developed to accomplish selective O/N functionalisation in amino alcohols has been documented. In this review, we go over a number of findings that have been studied in recent decades using a variety of synthetic approaches. To help us organize and emphasize the important ideas that have been emerging as a result of these research, we have concentrated on the suggested mechanistic basis of the reactions that are being surveyed.</dc:description>

         <title>n&#8208;Bu4NI/K2S2O8&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;N Coupling Between Aldehydes and Amides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An n&#8208;Bu4NI/K2S2O8&#8208;mediated substrate&#8208;dependent C&#8722;N coupling between aldehydes and amides is reported. When an aromatic aldehyde bears electron&#8208;donating groups at either the ortho or para position of the formyl group, a transformylation takes place exclusively. Without these groups, a cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling dominates. Furthermore, when 2&#8208;aminobenzamide is employed, only quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones are obtained regardless of the aldehyde used.







Abstract
n&#8208;Bu4NI/K2S2O8 mediated C&#8722;N coupling between aldehydes and amides is reported. A strong electronic effect is observed on the aromatic aldehyde substrates. The transformylation from aldehyde to amide takes place exclusively when an aromatic aldehyde bears electron&#8208;donating groups at either the ortho or para position of the formyl group, while the cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling dominates in the absence of these groups. Both the density functional theory (DFT) thermochemistry calculations and experimental data support the proposed single electron transfer mechanism with the formation of an acyl radical intermediate in the cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling. The n&#8208;Bu4NI/K2S2O8 mediated oxidative cyclization between 2&#8208;aminobenzamide and aldehydes is also reported, with four quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones prepared in 65&#8211;99&#8201;% yields.

         <dc:description>
This article reports a mild protocol for visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated Minisci&#8208;type C&#8722;H alkylation reactions of N&#8208;heteroarenes with 2&#8208;mercaptothiazolinium salts without using extra acids, furnishing the corresponding functionalized N&#8208;heteroarenes in good to high yields.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated radical heteroarylation of 2&#8208;mercaptothiazolinium salts with N&#8208;heteroarenes is reported, furnishing the corresponding functionalized N&#8208;heteroarenes in good to high yields. Various alkyl bromides were converted conveniently into redox&#8208;active thiazolinium salts and subsequently into alkyl radicals by reaction with an excited&#8208;state photocatalyst. This mild protocol permits efficient functionalization of various N&#8208;heteroarenes with a wild range of cyclic and acyclic primary and secondary alkyl groups.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis and Functionalization of tert&#8208;Butylsulfinyl&#8208;2&#8208;(Chlorodiphenylmethyl)Pyrrolidine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
tert&#8208;Butylsulfinyl&#8208;2&#8208;(chlorodiphenylmethyl)pyrrolidine can be obtained in high isolated yield and as a single diastereoisomer by the addition of (chlorodiphenylmethyl)lithium to chiral sulfinyl imines deriving from 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;butyrate. SN1 solvolysis reactions with different alcohols, with or without silver salts, allow access to various chiral diphenylprolinol alkyl ethers, some of which are not easily obtained using the known methods.







Abstract
The addition of the carbenoid species (chlorodiphenylmethyl)lithium to chiral N&#8208;(4&#8208;bromobutylidene)&#8208;2&#8208;methylpropane&#8208;2&#8208;sulfinamide affords in high yield (up to 81&#8201;%) and excellent diastereoselectivity (&gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1) the yet undisclosed tert&#8208;butylsulfinyl&#8208;2&#8208;(chlorodiphenylmethyl)pyrrolidine. Preliminary investigations into SN1 solvolysis reactions of this chloride with different alcohols revealed its potential for further functionalizations leading to differently substituted chiral pyrrolidines, yet showing a relative lability of the tert&#8208;butylsulfinyl chiral auxiliary under the employed reaction conditions. Most notably, reactions with sterically hindered alcohols yielded unprecedented derivatives, not easily obtainable using the currently reported procedures for the stereoselective synthesis of diphenylprolinol derivatives.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Allylation of Isocyanoacetates with Vinyl&#8208;Aziridines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical and efficient protocol has been developed for the direct synthesis of &#945;&#8208;allylated isocyanoacetates through palladium&#8208;catalyzed highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective allylation of &#945;&#8208;isocyanoacetates with vinyl aziridines under mild conditions.







Abstract
The first palladium&#8208;catalyzed allylation of isocyanoacetates with vinyl aziridines has been developed. The reaction conditions were suitable for a variety of &#945;&#8208;aryl isocyanoacetates as well as N&#8208;substituted vinyl aziridines, affording the corresponding allylation products in moderate to high yields (up to 98&#8201;%) along with excellent stereoselectivity and regioselectivity. Transformations of the allylation products into trans&#8208;4,5&#8208;dehydrolysine analogues and a highly functionalized proline ester derivative were further demonstrated, and a preliminary asymmetric version of the reaction has also been evaluated.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and efficient synthetic protocol to access two biologically important scaffolds, 2,3&#8208;diarylindanones and 2&#8208;arylindenes, is described. The modular approach involves ring&#8208;opening of highly strained 2,3&#8208;diarylcyclopropenones with coumarins to form &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters and enables the formation of two different series of indane scaffolds by merely changing the reaction conditions.







Abstract
A novel strategy has been developed for the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;diarylindanones and 2&#8208;arylindenes through the formation of trisubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters by the ring opening of 2,3&#8208;diarylcyclopropenones in the presence of a catalytic amount of TPP under mild reaction conditions. Initially, PPh3 activates the diarycyclopropenone to generate the phosphonium adduct, which simultaneously reacts with 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins to afford &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters instead of Wittig olefination. Subsequently, these &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters undergo a smooth Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization with arenes in the presence of AlCl3 to give a new series of 2,3&#8208;diarylindanones in good to excellent yields. Additionally, the reduction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters with NaBH4 followed by acid&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of the resulting allylic alcohols afforded 2&#8208;arylindenes in good yields. This is the first report on the use of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters as precursors for the synthesis of diarylindanones and arylindenes.

         <dc:description>Here, we have successfully achieved the addition of difluoroacetate radicals to 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones, enabling various difluoroalkylations of C2&#8208;tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;aryl indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones in a highly efficient and economical manner. It is worth mentioning that these difluoroalkylation compounds can be easily transformed into various derivatives under mild reaction conditions. Control experiments suggest the involvement of ethyl difluoroacetate radical species in the reaction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Cis&#8208;5,15&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;trifluorometylphenyl)calix[4]pyrrole (1) forms stable 1/1 complexes with linear anions such as N3&#8208;, SCN&#8209; and NCO&#8209; with the highest affinity for NCO&#8208; anion in acetonitrile solution. Crystallization of receptor 1 with TBASCN and (TMA)2SO4 resulted in the formation of dimeric capsular assembly, {(TMA)2[12&#8226;(SCN)2]}, in which two thiocyanate anions are encapsulated. On the other hand, 1&#8226;OCN(TMA) and 1&#8226;N3(TMA) complexes form one dimensional columnar structure in the solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>UNDERSTANDING GOLD&#8208;ALKYNE ACTIVATION FROM BOND DISSOCIATION ENERGIES OF GOLD&#8208;ALKYNE COMPLEXES</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A detailed approach into electronic effects of ligands on gold&#8208;alkyne interactions has been carried out in the gas phase using tandem mass spectrometry. A semi&#8208;empirical method coupled to DFT calculations was used to quantify ligands effects on Au&#8208;CC bond strength. To this end, the critical energies of 16 [L&#8208;Au&#8208;hex&#8208;3&#8208;yne]+ complexes with different L ligands were determined through collision induced dissociation. It was observed that electron&#8208;rich ligands destabilize the gold&#8208;alkyne bond, whereas phosphites and carbenes strengthened it. The influence of alkyne electronic effects on the gold&#8208;alkyne bond has also been studied by dissociation in tandem mass spectrometry on four different alkynes. In an original approach, two successive ion&#8208;molecule reactions within the mass spectrometer were used to measure the relative affinity of gold to an alkyne by exchange reactions. The result is that the more electron&#8208;rich the alkyne, the stronger the gold&#8208;alkyne bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Rh Diene Catalysis under Confinement: Isoxazole Ring&#8208;Contraction in Mesoporous Solids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent immobilization of chiral dienes in mesoporous solids for asymmetric heterogeneous catalysis is highly attractive. In order to study confinement effects in bimolecular vs monomolecular reactions, a series of pseudo&#8208;C2&#8208;symmetrical tetrahydropentalenes was synthesized and immobilized via click reaction on different mesoporous solids (silica, carbon, covalent organic frameworks) and compared with homogeneous conditions. Two types of Rh&#8208;catalyzed reactions were studied: (a) bimolecular nucleophilic 1,2&#8208;additions of phenylboroxine to N&#8208;tosylimine and (b) monomolecular isomerization of isoxazole to 2H&#8208;azirne. Polar support materials performed better than non&#8208;polar ones. Under confinement, bimolecular reactions showed decreased yields, whereas yields in monomolecular reactions were only little affected. Regarding enantioselectivity the opposite trend was observed, i.e. effective enantiocontrol for bimolecular reactions but only little control for monomolecular reactions was found.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An efficient method for the conversion of biphenyl acrylamides to dibenzoazepinones with &#8208;SCF3 incorporation is described. This operationally simple radical cascade reaction employs CAN as an oxidant and exhibits good functional group tolerance. Substrates featuring &#8208;OCH3, &#8208;CH3, &#8208;Br or &#8208;Cl at the para&#8208;position of the aromatic ring exhibits a preference for an ipso&#8208;cyclization due to the intervention of DMSO in the reaction.

The visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced or electrochemically catalytic functionalization of 1,3&#8208;butadiene to construct diverse allyl compounds with valuable groups was reviewed. Through direct 1,4&#8208;, 1,2&#8208;, or 2&#8208;functionalization, a lot of functional groups, such as alkyl groups, nucleophilic reagents, phosphoryl groups, aryl groups, or alkyl alcohol, were introduced in mild, green, and atom&#8208;economy conditions.







Abstract
In recent years, the functionalization of 1,3&#8208;butadiene has become an attractive strategy for constructing allyl compounds with molecular and structural complexity, and the current research focuses on synthetic chemistry and organic synthesis. Compared with the traditional synthesis method, the synthesis methods promoted by photochemistry or electrochemistry represent an environmentally friendly and mild strategy. In this review, the functionalization reactions of 1,3&#8208;butadiene under photochemical/electrochemical processes in recent years are reviewed according to the classification of functionalization systems, with particular emphasis on the corresponding reaction mechanism, which lays a foundation for further exploration of new catalytic methods.

         <title>Fabrication of a Highly Efficient and Reusable Pd/Al2O3/Al Monolithic Catalyst for the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anodization was employed to treat the aluminum foil surface, leading to in situ the generation of Al2O3, consequently amplifying the specific surface area to aid in the dispersal of palladium nanoparticles. Through the anodic oxidation of aluminum followed by a precipitation&#8208;deposition and calcination process, a highly efficient and reusable Pd/Al2O3/Al monolithic catalyst was synthesized. The effectiveness and reusability of the Pd/Al2O3/Al monolithic catalyst were evaluated in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction. The turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) of the Pd/Al2O3/Al monolithic catalyst reached 73,880 and 0.86 s&#8208;1, respectively. Furthermore, the catalyst could be recovered and reused in reactions regardless of the used substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Monofluoromethylthioesters from Acyl Chlorides with Elemental Sulfur and Fluoroiodomethane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical nickel&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of monofluoromethylthioesters from acyl chlorides has been developed. In this protocol, acyl chloride intermediates were initially formed and then subjected to the nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction with S8 and ICH2F, delivering the corresponding products in moderate to high yields.







Abstract
We report an unprecedented Ni&#8208;catalyzed direct monofluoromethylthiolation of acyl chlorides, in&#8197;situ generated from carboxylic acids, with elemental sulfur (S8) as the S source and fluoroiodomethane (ICH2F) as the CH2F radical source to produce a series of monofluoromethylthioesters in moderate to good yields. This approach features excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. Additionally, the late&#8208;stage monofluoromethylthiolation of complex bioactive molecules can also be accomplished using this method.

     alt="Direct Synthesis of Monofluoromethylthioesters from Acyl Chlorides with Elemental Sulfur and Fluoroiodomethane"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A practical nickel-catalyzed synthesis of monofluoromethylthioesters from acyl chlorides has been developed. In this protocol, acyl chloride intermediates were initially formed and then subjected to the nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction with S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and ICH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F, delivering the corresponding products in moderate to high yields.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report an unprecedented Ni-catalyzed direct monofluoromethylthiolation of acyl chlorides, in&#8197;situ generated from carboxylic acids, with elemental sulfur (S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) as the S source and fluoroiodomethane (ICH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F) as the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F radical source to produce a series of monofluoromethylthioesters in moderate to good yields. This approach features excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. Additionally, the late-stage monofluoromethylthiolation of complex bioactive molecules can also be accomplished using this method.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Catalyst and Additive&#8208;Free C(sp3)&#8208;H Phosphorylation of Glycine Ester Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, efficient and environmentally friendly method is proposed for the synthesis of a series of structurally diverse phosphine&#8208;glycine derivatives by direct irradiation of glycine derivatives and diarylphosphine oxides with blue visible light at room temperature using only air (oxygen) as an oxidant. A possible mechanism was also proposed in conjunction with controlled experiments.







Abstract
We herein report a visible light induced dehydrogenative phosphonylation reaction of glycine derivatives and di&#8208;aryl phosphine oxides. A diverse range of phosphine&#8208;glycine derivatives were constructed under ambient condition in the absence of catalyst and additives. A plausible mechanism was also proposed.

         <title>Leveraging Propargyl Sulfides as Radical Trappers for the Synthesis of Sulfonyl Allenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work showcases a novel visible&#8208;light mediated allenylation protocol employing propargyl sulfides as a radical trapping methodology. An array of substituted sulfonyl allenes were successfully synthesized under mild conditions. Mechanistically, this process entails the formation of sulfonyl radicals, their subsequent addition to alkynes, the elimination of S&#8208;centered radicals, and Cl&#8208;atom abstraction, thereby facilitating the propagation of this radical chain reaction.







Abstract
This work showcases a novel visible&#8208;light mediated allenylation protocol employing propargyl sulfides as a pioneering radical trapping methodology. A diverse array of substituted sulfonyl allenes were successfully synthesized under mild conditions with commendable levels of chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selectivity. Mechanistically, this process entails the formation of sulfonyl radicals, their subsequent addition to alkynes, the subsequent elimination of S&#8208;centered radicals, and Cl&#8208;atom abstraction, thereby facilitating the propagation of this radical chain reaction.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 4&#8208;carboxylates of 1,2,3&#8208;triazine 1&#8208;oxides undergo [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition with in situ generated benzynes and naphthyne and also with cyclooctyne that, following retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder extrusion of dinitrogen, form isoxazole&#8208;3&#8208;propenoate derivatives in high yields and diastereocontrol. This practical method occurs at room temperature and provides a wide range of isoxazole based heterocycles with diverse functionality. 1,2&#8208;naphthyne, an unsymmetrical alkyne, forms only one regioisomeric product, exemplifying inherent regioselectivity. Although high, stereoselectivity is not 100% in most cases, indicating that the loss of dinitrogen is stepwise. Derivative reactions of benzisoxazoles suggest their versatility.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A KOtBu&#8208;promoted robust strategy has been described for the regioselective synthesis of pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]quinolin&#8208;1&#8208;one and naphthyridin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;one derivatives from o&#8208;alkynylquinolinecarbonitriles in good to excellent yields. The reaction proceeds through in&#8208;situ transformation of nitrile moiety into amide group followed by the selective C&#8208;N bond formation via a 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig or 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig annulation reaction. Among the synthesized derivatives, 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig naphthyridin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones displayed good photophysical properties. The present approach is superior to other established methodologies owing to avoiding use of transition metals and column chromatographic purification and affording the products in high yields. Additionally, the current methodology provides several additional advantages like one&#8208;pot operation, high atom economy, broad substrate scope and step&#8208;economical process.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Fluorine&#8208;containing compounds are important in medicine or crop&#8208;protection.

Ball&#8208;milling convey the reaction in short times and high product yields, while keeping high enantiomeric purities of products. The reaction is diastereodivergent depending on the use of either monofunctional amine catalysts or bifunctional thiourea or squaramide.</dc:description>

         <title>Theoretical Mechanism Study of BH3&#8208;Mediated Reduction of P&#8208;Stereogenic Hydroxyalkylphosphine Oxides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The BH3&#8208;mediated reduction of P&#8208;stereogenic hydroxyalkylphosphine oxides was investigated by Density Functional Theory calculations. By combining theoretical approaches with experimental observations, we explored two mechanisms that account for its stereospecificity, implying an inversion of the configuration at the phosphorus atom. One mechanism proceeds through a cyclic intermediate in which the coordination of borane to the oxygen atoms lowers the BH3.THF&#8208;attack barrier. However, the free energy barrier for this combined process is too high for a reaction feasible at room temperature. The calculations rather support a second mechanism that proceeds through from the same cyclic intermediate and the in&#8208;situ formation of BH4&#8208; as reducing agent.</dc:description>

A general method to prepare 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;pyrido[2,3&#8208;b]pyrazines from 3&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;fluoropyridine is described. The method relies on 2H&#8208;azirine electrophilic activation via a Tf2O/DTBMP combination. Variation of the pyridine substitution pattern along with 2H&#8208;azirines provided single regioisomers of the bicyclic heterocycles







Abstract
The electrophilic activation of 2H&#8208;azirines with triflic anhydride (Tf2O) for an addition/cyclization reaction producing 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;pyrido[2,3&#8208;b]pyrazines regioselectively is described. This reaction proceeds via nucleophilic addition of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;fluoropyridines onto 1&#8208;trifloyl&#8208;aziridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl triflates and subsequent cyclization via SNAr. Desulfonylation and oxidation provides a single regioisomer of the aza&#8208;bicyclic heterocycle after treatment with Et3N. Optimization of the reaction conditions lead to a range of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;pyrido[2,3&#8208;b]pyrazines in isolated yields of 20&#8201;% to 60&#8201;%.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Based Deep Eutectic Solvents: Key Players for Amide and Sulfonamide Synthesis and Alcohol Oxidation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective and sustainable oxidation of secondary alcohols to their corresponding carbonyl compounds, alongside their applications as selective mono&#8208;alkylating reagents for both amide and arylsulfonamide derivatives, is achieved under aerobic and mild (40&#8201;&#176;C) conditions in reusable Fe&#8208;based Lewis acidic deep eutectic solvents.







Abstract
A sustainable protocol has been devised for the oxidation of activated secondary alcohols to their corresponding carbonyl compounds, as well as their utilization as selective mono&#8208;alkylating reagents for both amide and arylsulfonamide derivatives. These reactions proceed smoothly and in good yields (up to 98&#8201;%) when conducted in Fe&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents (DESs), which serve dual roles as solvents and catalysts. Operating under mild (40&#8201;&#176;C) and aerobic conditions, these transformations are completed within a 4&#8197;h time frame. A pharmacologically relevant amide derivative, specifically a PMRT1 inhibitor, has also been successfully synthesized on a 3&#8197;g&#8208;scale utilizing a reusable FeCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O/glycerol Lewis acidic DES.

         <title>Recent Progress in the Photocatalytic Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Primary Amines</title>

         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Tertiary primary amines (&#945;&#8208;TPAs) bearing a fully substituted carbon center adjacent to the N&#8208;unsubstituted amino group (&#8208;NH2) exhibit unique biochemical and physicochemical activities. While due to the sterically congested structure and strong nucleophilic and alkaline natures of these N&#8208;unsubstituted primary amine compounds, their facile synthesis remains an inherent challenge. Traditional methods commonly rely on tedious N&#8208;protection/deprotection operations and highly reactive organometallic reagents, thus leading to poor atom and step&#8208;economy and limited functional group compatibility. Modern photoredox catalysis offers a robust tool to prepare such structurally unique and synthetically valuable amine architectures via a radical pathway under extremely mild conditions. In this review, the recent progress in photocatalytic synthesis of &#945;&#8208;TPAs is systematically reviewed, and the reaction scope, limitations, and mechanisms for the reactions are discussed.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new strategy for thiochromen&#8208;4&#8208;one synthesis that relies on the denitrative formal [5 + 1] cycloaddition of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ones with thioacetamide is described. Achieved under reaction conditions that did not require transition metal catalysis, nor the exclusion of air or moisture, the reaction is suggested to involve exploiting the propensity of thioacetamide to undergo hydrolysis under basic conditions. This is follows by addition of the ensuing sulfide anion to the 1,3&#8208;alkynone and a nucleophilic aromatic substitution and denitrative rearomatization cascade to give the S&#8208;heterocyclic product in yields of 41&#8208;99%.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Pyridone ribo&#8208;C&#8208;Nucleosides via Heck Reaction and Oxidation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleosides find applications in medicinal chemistry, chemical biology and diagnostics. Among the nucleosides, C&#8209;nucleosides have attracted particular attention because their carbon&#8208;carbon bond between nucleobase and ribose provides stability against degradation. While several well&#8208;established methods exist for the synthesis of 2'&#8208;deoxy&#8208;C&#8208;nucleosides, the preparation of their ribofuranosyl counterparts is more challenging. Established methods for their synthesis give mixtures of anomers and require harsh reagents or conditions. Here we report a diastereoselective glycosylation method involving a Heck reaction between a glycal and an aryl iodide, followed by oxidation of the silyl enol ether with methyl(trifluoromethyl)dioxirane (TFDO). The resulting ketone is then diastereoselectively reduced to the ribonucleoside. The new route has been applied to pyridones and is expected to also yield other ribo&#8208;C&#8209;nucleosides in diastereoselective fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>Green Light&#8208;Responsive D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D Quinoxaline Emitters for Luminescent Solar Concentrators: Potential Integration in Agrivoltaic Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new family of quinoxaline&#8208;based dyes for the assembly of luminescent solar concentrators (LSC) with promising performances for applications in agrivoltaic technologies. These materials are transparent to the photosynthetically relevant green radiations, while strongly absorb other wavelengths with good emission in the red region of the visible spectrum.







Abstract
The integration of photovoltaic technologies within agricultural settings, also known as agrivoltaics, is attracting increasing attention as a sustainable approach to ensure both clean energy and food supply. The success of this strategy relies on the development of innovative materials that can selectively convert specific wavelengths into energy while being transparent to photosynthetically relevant light. To this aim, here we report our endeavors in the synthesis of a new class of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D quinoxaline fluorophores and their use in the preparation of wavelength&#8208;selective luminescent solar concentrators. The dyes were expeditiously prepared following a direct arylation protocol and extensively characterized by spectroscopic analyses and computational studies. They present high light harvesting ability in the green region of the visible spectrum and good emission properties, which were fully retained in the solid state when embedded into a poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) matrix. These materials were employed to construct LSC devices of promising efficiency, fostering further developments for the use of wavelength&#8208;selective LSC in agrivoltaic systems.

         <title>FeF3&#8208;Promoted Radical Fluoroalkylation of o&#8208;Alkenylaryl Isocyanides to Access 2&#8208;Fluoroalkylated Quinolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for preparing quinolines through iron(III)&#8208;promoted radical fluoroalkylation was developed. In the presence of FeF3 and Cs2CO3, a variety of o&#8208;alkenylaryl isocyanides smoothly underwent the radical fluoroalkylation with perfluoroalkyl iodides to afford biologically important 2&#8208;fluoroalkylated quinolines in 38&#8211;81&#8201;% yields. Moreover, the conditions are compatible with nonfluorinated alkyl iodides leading to 2&#8208;alkylated quinolines.







Abstract
An iron(III)&#8208;promoted radical fluoroalkylation of o&#8208;alkenylaryl isocyanides has been developed using readily available perfluoroalkyl iodides as fluoroalkyl source. This cyclization reaction features broad substrate scope and provides a simple and efficient approach for regioselective construction of biologically important 2&#8208;fluoroalkylated quinolines in 38&#8211;81&#8201;% yields.

         <title>Linear &#960;&#8208;Extension of Acridone by the Fusion of Cyclobutadienoid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalization of small aromatic heterocycles is a straight and efficient method to access large polycyclic conjugated molecules. However, due to its unique reactivity, the derivatization of acridone usually gives the product in the angular shape and is difficult to obtain the linear ones. Here we report the direct functionalization of acridone to generate its linearly fused derivatives containing cyclobutadienoid via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed arene&#8208;(oxa)norbornene annulation followed by the dehydrated aromatization. The experimental characterizations demonstrate that the antiaromatic cyclobutadienoid ring can extend the molecular conjugation. Theoretical calculations reveal the weakened aromaticity of neighboring benzenoid rings of cyclobutadienoid with no influence on the electronic structure of central pyridone. The molecular stability is enhanced in comparison to that of linear acridone derivatives containing only six&#8208;membered rings.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl alkenes are versatile CF3&#8208;containing feedstocks. They have been widely used to construct gem&#8208;difluoroalkene scaffolds via &#946;&#8208;F elimination.

In this paper, we report an efficient route for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylated ketones from easily&#8208;accessed &#945;&#8208;CF3 styrenes and aromatic carboxylic acids under photoredox catalysis. The reactions proceed through phosphoranyl radical&#8208;promoted deoxygenation of aromatic acids, generating acyl radicals for subsequent hydroacylation of &#945;&#8208;CF3 styrenes.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Indirect and Regioselective Phosphonation of Azobenzenes: Toward the Design of Water&#8208;Soluble Photoswitches</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H acyloxylation of azobenzenes enabling the regioselective introduction of the double&#8208;functionalized phophonoacetate motif was developed. The method proved tolerant for a wide range of substituents. Chemoselective hydrolysis of the diethylphosphonate function leads to a water&#8208;soluble azobenzene with interesting photophysical properties, holding great promise for the design of water&#8208;soluble photochemical tools for future biological applications.







Abstract
An efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed ortho C&#8722;H acyloxylation of azobenzenes, allowing the introduction of the difunctionalised substituent, diethylphosphonoacetate, is reported. Thanks to the mild reaction conditions implemented, this regioselective late&#8208;stage ortho&#8208;functionalization tolerates a wide range of functional groups and permits the access of diversely substituted azobenzenes in good to excellent yields. Selective hydrolysis of the diethyl phosphonate group leads to stable water&#8208;soluble azo&#8208;photoswitches with interesting photophysical properties such as an extended Z&#8208;isomer half&#8208;life, opening new opportunities in the design of optochemical tools for the exploration of living organisms.

         <title>New Strategies to Improve the Efficiency of Curcumin&#8208;Based Iridium Complexes for OLED Devices</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among the solid&#8208;state lighting technologies, OLEDs occupy a prominent position for the high efficiencies associated with the low CO2 emissions. In line with the recent studies aimed at designing sustainable and biodegradable devices, herein we report on the synthesis of a series of iridium(III) complexes featuring, as &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands, curcumin and 6&#8208;dehydrogingerdione, two natural compounds found in the rhizome of Curcuma longa and Zingiber officinale. To improve the solubility of both the ligands and prevent the aggregation of the complexes, oleoyl residues were inserted on the phenolic &#8208;OH groups. The resulting complexes exhibited a green emission with quantum yields as high as 2.8% (relative to fluorescein). OLED devices were fabricated by using, as emitting layer, a host&#8208;guest blend of the iridium complex in 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bis(N&#8208;carbazolyl)&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenyl (CBP). The morphological analysis revealed that thin films of the emitting layer were homogeneous. The devices fabricated with iridium complexes from 6&#8208;dehydrogingerdione exhibited higher luminance, efficiency and power efficiency with respect to the corresponding devices obtained from curcumin; also the functionalization of the &#946;&#8208;diketone unit with the oleoyl residue proved to increase significantly the performance of the device. Overall, these data suggest that aggregation is a key factor that compromise the performances of the corresponding OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Kanamycin&#8208;Cu(II) Complex Catalyzed Ullmann Amine Synthesis at Room Temperature: A Tool for Mechanistic Insights into Methylene Blue Degradation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study highlights the significance of Ullmann coupling reaction in modern organic synthesis and advances catalytic methodologies through the introduction of a kanamycin&#8208;copper complex as a highly efficient catalyst for the synthesis of diverse N&#8208;Aryl compounds. We demonstrate the catalyst's versatility through the synthesis of 20 Daryl&#8208;amine instances, 21 Ar(het)&#8208;N compounds, and 10 miscellaneous examples. NMR, IR, and UV spectroscopy offers insights into the catalyst's behaviour. Additionally, DFT studies support the catalyst's proficiency in generating SO4 radicals by stabilizing with aminosugars moieties. Ex&#8208;situ NMR experiments confirm a ternary complex&#8208;based mechanism at concentrations below 0.1&#956;M. Furthermore, we showcase the degradation of methylene blue to its precursor amine under optimized conditions. Overall, this research underscores the potential of Ullmann condensation reactions in contemporary organic synthesis and contributes significantly to the advancement of catalytic methodologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Promoted Oxidative Amidation of Imines: A Facile Route to Amides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for preparing amides by imines oxidation is developed using aldehydes and amines as raw materials. Using copper oxide as catalyst and Oxone as oxidant without any coupling reagents, the reaction conditions are mild. A wide substrate range including pesticide and drug molecules has been demonstrated in 32&#8211;90&#8201;% yields.







Abstract
Herein, an environmentally friendly and efficient amidation method of imines by Oxone and CuO has been developed. This facile method shows excellent selectivity without affecting other functional groups such as phenyls, halogens, cyans, esters or heterocycles. This method features a broad substrate scope, mild conditions and high yields (&#8804;90&#8201;%), and the yield in the gram scale experiment also reaches up to 81&#8201;%. Flonicamid, moclobemide and bupivacaine are also successfully synthesized to demonstrate its potential utilities.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multicomponent Kr&#246;hnke reaction of chalcones with 1&#8208;(3,3,3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxopropyl)pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium bromide and ammonium acetate is described. This strategy allows efficiently construction of a series of 2&#8208;trifluoromethyl pyridines with broad functional groups.







Abstract
A multicomponent Kr&#246;hnke reaction route toward 2&#8208;trifluoromethyl pyridines from reaction of chalcones with easily available and stable 1&#8208;(3,3,3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxopropyl)pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium bromide and ammonium acetate is reported. The reaction is found to be general with a range of substituted chalcones, and the applicability of the methodology in gram scale is demonstrated. Preliminary results suggest that this transformation is initiated by 1,4&#8208;Michael addition, followed by inter&#8208; and intramolecular nucleophilic addition, and elimination.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Reactions of Alkenes with C&#8722;C Bond Formation: Recent Developments</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkenes are highly valuable materials in organic synthesis, and their three&#8208;component reactions offer a promising method for C&#8722;C bond formation and carbon chain elongation. This approach not only reduces the number of reaction steps but also minimizes waste generation, enabling the preparation of polysubstituted alkanes from simple starting materials. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advancements in this field from 2013 to 2023.

Alkenes are highly valuable materials in organic synthesis, and their three&#8208;component reactions offer a promising method for C&#8722;C bond formation and carbon chain elongation. This approach not only reduces the number of reaction steps but also minimizes waste generation, enabling the preparation of polysubstituted alkanes from simple starting materials. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advancements in this field from 2013 to 2023. We have classified the developments into three main categories: (1) reactions triggered by C&#8208;radicals or heteroatom&#8208;radicals; (2) cascades involving three&#8208;membered ring intermediates; and (3) transformations catalyzed by metals. We will discuss a wide range of reactions that involve diazoium salts, arylhydrazines, acids, aldehydes, 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls, diazo compounds, amines, malononitriles, diacyl peroxides, ethers, 1,3&#8208;dithiane, arenes, CuSCF3, selectfluor, Et3N&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3HF, TBHP, CH2Cl2, CHCl3, CO2, CO, KCl, H2O, and other reagents. These reactions lead to alkylation, arylation, or carbonylation products. We believe that this review will be helpful for future research in this area.

         <title>Atropisomeric Properties of 5N&#8208;Benzoyl&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzodiazepin&#8208;2&#8208;ones: Substituent Effects on Rotation around the Ar&#8722;N(CO) Axis</title>

         <dc:description>
Atropisomeric properties of 5N&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzodiazepin&#8208;2&#8208;one with two Ar&#8722;N(CO) axes moving like gears were investigated. The rotational barrier (&#916;G&#8800;) of the axes was strongly influenced by the electronic effect of the p&#8208;substituent on benzoyl, and the electron&#8208;withdrawing group (EWG) increased the stability of the axes. The &#916;G&#8800; values were linearly correlated with the electronic effect (the Hammett &#963; constants) of functional groups.







Abstract
5N&#8208;Benzoyl&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzodiazepin&#8208;2&#8208;ones with various substituents were synthesized and their atropisomeric properties were analyzed. For the rotational isomers (E/Z) based on the amide bond [N&#8722;C(=O)], the E&#8208;isomers were preferentially formed regardless of the substituents. Atropisomers (aR/aS) due to the Ar&#8722;N(CO) (sp2&#8208;sp2) axis were isolated using chiral HPLC, and the rotational barrier (&#916;G&#8800;) in thermal isomerization was measured. The rotation barrier about the Ar&#8722;N(CO) axis was affected by both the substituents at the C6&#8208;position and the p&#8208;substituents on the benzoyl group. The substituents at C6 (R1) caused both steric and electronic effects. On the other hand, the p&#8208;substituents (R2) on the benzoyl group caused electronic effects: the electron&#8208;donating group (EDG) lowered the &#916;G&#8800; value, whereas the electron&#8208;withdrawing group (EWG) raised it. The &#916;G&#8800; values were linearly correlated with the magnitude of the electronic effect (Hammett &#963; constants) of functional groups (R2). The EDG causes an increase in the electron density on the carbonyl moiety in the amide, which may disturb the planarity of the amide bond, resulting in a decrease in the &#916;G&#8800; value.

         <title>Fluoroalkoxylating Reagents in Organic Synthesis: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advancement in the development of fluoroalkoxylating (ORf) reagents for the preparation of prestigious ORf&#8208;containing compounds is described in this review.







Abstract
The fluoroalkoxy groups (ORf) are widely used motifs in pharmaceutical and agrochemical fields due to their unique physicochemical properties including higher lipophilicity and increased metabolic stability. Thus, the high value of ORf&#8208;containing derivatives has stimulated the development of fluoroalkoxylation reactions. In this review, we highlight the recent progress of various trifluoroalkoxylating reagents and their applications in organic synthesis in the past five years.

         <dc:description>The trifluoromethoxy moiety, an emerging fluorinated group, shows interesting properties for pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications. However, only few methods have been reported for the direct introduction of this group on molecules with high efficiency, safety and low cost. Indeed, most of direct trifluoromethoxylation reagents are either expensive, hazardous or require preliminary synthesis before their use. Here we describe the use of 2,4&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1&#8208;(trifluoromethoxy)benzene (DNTFB) as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, safe, commercially available and cheap source of trifluoromethoxide anion for the trifluoromethoxylation of arynes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Heteroditopic calix[6]arenes are widely employed macrocycles for the synthesis of pseudo&#8208;oriented interlocked systems and stimuli&#8208;induced molecular machines, among others. Herein, we introduce a new calix[6]arene receptor functionalised with three phenylselenoureido groups. These hydrogen&#8208;bonding donor moieties are able to promote the threading of viologen&#8208;based organic axles inside the macrocyclic cavity to form a stable pseudorotaxane species. Preliminary investigations using 1H&#8208;NMR measurements and semi&#8208;empirical and DFT studies suggested its further use as a platform for the synthesis of rotaxanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogenation of Alkenes Using Three&#8208;Component Reactions: A Decade of Development</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkenes are valuable feedstocks in organic synthesis. One effective method for synthesizing organic halides with functional groups in close proximity involves the direct difunctionalization of alkenes via three&#8208;component reactions. This approach not only reduces the number of steps involved in the synthesis process, but also minimizes waste generation and enables the formation of complex molecules from simple starting materials. In this review, we mainly discuss decade developments (2013&#8208;2023) in two categories: (1) halogenation via three&#8208;membered ring intermediates, involving haliranium, thiiranium, seleniranium, aziridinium and epoxide species; (2) halogenation via a radical pathway. Reactions with I2, BiI3, NaI, Bu4N+[I(O2CAr)2]&#8208;, NIS, NBS, NCS, DBH, BsNMeBr, HBr, HCl, KI, NH4I, I2O5, Et3N&#183;3HF, Selectfluor, CuI, CuBr, CuCl, LiCl, KBr, NaCl, SOCl2, Py&#183;9HF, NFSI, TBSCl et al have been recorded and how the added reagents work will be discussed. We hope this review will do help for future research in this area.</dc:description>

         <title>Daphnicyclidin Alkaloids 2001&#8211;2023</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article provides a chronological overview of the 23 structurally diverse daphnicyclidin alkaloids isolated to date and highlights the various synthesis contributions that have been published to date on this unique group of alkaloids.







Abstract
The Daphniphyllum alkaloids represent a particularly diverse class of complex diterpene alkaloids, which are characterized by their enormous structural diversity. The daphnicyclidins, a subgroup of these alkaloids, stand out due to their unique pentafulvene structural motif. This review article gives an overview of the compounds that have been isolated so far and can be assigned to this subgroup. Furthermore, all synthesis approaches and total syntheses published to date are presented.

         <title>Synthesis and Application of Well&#8208;Defined Fluoroalkyl Zinc Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reviewed the preparation and application of these zinc fluoroalkyl complexes, with a focus on recently reported reactions with potential synthetic interest. From the perspective of reaction mechanism, the transfer of trifluoromethyl from zinc complexes to copper catalysts formed the highly active trifluoromethyl copper reagents, which can be directly used for the fluoroalkylation.







Abstract
Fluoroalkyl groups play an irreplaceable role in the field of pharmaceutical and agrochemical industry due to their unique properties. Based on this, it is crucial to effectively introduce fluoroalkyl groups into target molecules. In this review, we describe the synthesis of well&#8208;defined fluoroalkyl zinc complexes and their applications in the fluoroalkylation of compounds. Different from the reactivities of copper fluoroalkyl complexes, fluoroalkyl zinc complexes often needed to be combined with copper or nickel catalysts when participating in fluoroalkylation reactions. From the perspective of reaction mechanism, the transfer of trifluoromethyl from zinc complexes to copper catalysts formed the highly active trifluoromethyl copper reagents, which can be directly used for the fluoroalkylation. In most cases, the desired target products were provided with excellent yields.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Tabernanthine and Ibogaline: Rapid Access to Nosyl Tryptamines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total syntheses of tabernanthine and ibogaline were enabled by application of a thermal coupling of nosyl aziridine and indoles in eight steps each, 10 and 14&#8201;% yield respectively. A Friedel&#8208;Crafts type macrocyclization facilitated key C&#8722;C bond formation. Regio&#8208; and diastereoselective hydroboration&#8208;oxidation of the resultant macrocyclic alkene enabled C&#8722;N bond formation and furnished the completed isoquinuclidine ring system.







Abstract
We describe the first total syntheses of tabernanthine and ibogaline. Entry to these iboga alkaloid natural products is enabled by a thermal coupling of indoles and aziridines to furnish the requisite nosyl tryptamine starting materials. This route features a Friedel&#8208;Crafts type alkylation to form the key indole&#8208;isoquinuclidine C&#8722;C bond. Finally, a regio&#8208; and diastereoselective hydroboration&#8208;oxidation enables C&#8722;N bond formation to close the isoquinuclidine ring system and deliver tabernanthine and ibogaline in 10 and 14&#8201;% yield respectively. Both syntheses were completed in eight steps.

A library of fluorene&#8208; or fluorenone motif installed amino acid motifs possessing anti stereochemistry including phenylalanine norvaline, leucine, norleucine, and 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid, alanine, and non&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives was accomplished.

Abstract
This paper reports the construction of racemic and enantiopure (D&#8208; and L&#8208;) fluorene and fluorenone&#8208;based novel unnatural amino acid derivatives. The Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed bidentate directing group&#8208;aided arylation of prochiral &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds in racemic, enantiopure carboxamides of amino acids with iodofluorenes was reported. The construction of novel examples of fluorene and fluorenone motifs containing amino acids comprising of norvaline, leucine, phenylalanine, norleucine, 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid derivatives having the anti&#8208;stereochemistry (with good enantiopurity) was accomplished. The construction of bis fluorenyl alanine scaffolds and fluorenyl motif&#8208;containing non&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid (aminoalkanoic acid) derivatives was also reported. Examples of removal of the directing group (8&#8208;aminoquinoline) and phthalimide&#8208;protecting group present in the fluorenyl&#8208;based unnatural amino acid derivatives have been shown. Accordingly, fluorene motif&#8208;based amino acid esters and free amino group&#8208;containing unnatural amino acid derivatives were synthesized. The stereochemistry of the major (anti) diastereomers obtained via the prochiral &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H arylation of norvaline, leucine, phenylalanine, norleucine, 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid derivatives was ascertained from the X&#8208;ray structure of a representative compound. Fluorene&#8208; and fluorenone&#8208;based motifs are vital skeletons in materials and medicinal chemistry research. Accordingly, this work is a contribution towards enriching the library of fluorene and fluorenone unnatural amino acid scaffolds.

         <title>Commercial Transaminases for the Asymmetric Synthesis of Bulky Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Commercially available transaminases are valuable tools for the synthesis of chiral amine building blocks and are very accessible to the synthetic chemistry community. We demonstrate that selected commercially available enzymes from Codexis&#8217; transaminase collection can accept and aminate bulky&#8208;bulky ketones in up to 99&#8201;%&#8201;ee.







Abstract
Transaminase&#8208;catalysed asymmetric amination is a valuable transformation for the synthesis of chiral amines. However, its use in synthetic chemistry has been curtailed by a narrow substrate scope and limited information on commercially available catalysts. In this work we have explored the substrate scope of selected commercially available transaminases, focusing on prochiral ketones bearing two bulky substituents and their application in both enzyme&#8208;catalysed and enzyme&#8208;triggered reactions. (R)&#8208; and/or (S)&#8208;selective enzymes converted methyl&#8208;, isopropyl&#8208;, n&#8208;butyl&#8208;, and cyclohexyl&#8208;phenone substrates to the corresponding amines in the range of 6&#8211;&gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee. In some cases, a stereochemical switch was detected, in which (R)&#8208;enantioselectivity was observed with enzymes typically assigned as (S)&#8208;selective. Upscaling of selected biotransformations provided chiral amines, in &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee and up to 40&#8201;% isolated yield. Furthermore, transaminase&#8208;triggered reactions, which were previously limited to methyl&#8208; and ethyl&#8208;derivatives, were expanded to phenyl&#8208;derivatives for the formation of a cis&#8208;2,6&#8208;disubstituted piperidine and 2,4&#8208;diphenyl pyrroline, and isolated in up to 67&#8201;% yield.

         <title>Decatungstate Catalyzed Benzylic C&#8722;H Trifluoromethylthiolation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a decatungstate catalyzed trifluoromethylthiolation of the benzylic C&#8722;H bond. The reaction features mild conditions and good functional group tolerance, generating corresponding products in moderate to good yields with a slight excess of benzylic substrates or as limiting reagents.







Abstract
Here we report a mild protocol for benzylic C&#8722;H trifluoromethylthiolation using sodium decatungstate (NaDT) as the photocatalyst. Wherein, photoactivated DT abstracted the benzylic hydrogen atom via a radical process. This transformation works well with a slight excess of benzylic substrates or as limiting reagents for better purification. The reaction shows mild conditions and good functional group tolerance. Moreover, the protocol could be applied to gram&#8208;scale synthesis.

         <dc:description>A series of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;ones were prepared by an efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot reaction of arylhydrazides, arylboronic acids and DMF. Moderate to good yield of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;ones were obtained using DMF as the carbonyl source and arylboronic as the aryl source. This reaction involved ligand exchange and transmetalation of copper catalysts with arylhydrazides and arylboric acids, followed by reductive elimination and intramolecular cyclization. Compared to the previous work, this work employs the stable and readily available aryl hydrazide and arylboronic substrates that enhance the practicality of this strategy, and this strategy features a short reaction time, relatively low heating temperature, convenient and more secure. Further, this protocol has the features of high functional group tolerance and reaction scalability.</dc:description>

A formal [4+2] cycloaddition reaction of ethynylethylene carbonates and 2&#8208;aminophenols has been developed successfully for the synthesis of a series of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[b][1,4]oxazine derivatives.







Abstract
A formal [4+2] cycloaddition reaction of ethynylethylene carbonates and 2&#8208;aminophenols has been developed for the synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[b][1,4]oxazines bearing quaternary carbon atoms. The reaction features mild reaction conditions, good functional group compatibility and good yields. Furthermore, when using chiral PyBox ligand, this strategy could also achieve the asymmetric synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[b][1,4]oxazines. Application studies indicated that the hydroxymethyl group of final products was an excellent functional group that can be further modified easily.

         <title>High Yield Synthesis of Spirocyclic Dienones from Phenols Employing Tribromide Catalysed Dearomatization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalytic strategy towards the tribromide&#8208;catalyzed dearomative spirocyclization reaction is described employing tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) and oxone as an oxidising agent. This methodology leads to the exclusive formation of spirofurano dienones without rearomatization or halogenation. Our group has been on trails of tribromide&#8208;catalyzed dearomative transformation during the last decade, and now this exhibits the first report which delivers high functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope with excellent yield (up to 99%) and good diastereoselectivity (dr up to 14:1).&#160;The oxidation of naphthols as well as phenols is achieved under this mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated organic compounds represent an important and growing family of active ingredients in various fields, including material science, pharmaceutical chemistry and biological science. Developing efficient synthetic methods toward fluorinated organic compounds have attracted much attention. In recent years, transition&#8208;metal catalyzed reaction of trifluoro diazo compounds involving trifluoro diazo compounds and their surrogates were a powerful and convenient approach to afford trifluoromethyl&#8208; and difluoromethyl&#8208;substituted compounds of value. In this review, the recent progress in this area is described in the sequence of 2,2,2&#8208;trifluorodiazoethane as carbene precursor, ethyl 3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;diazo&#8208;propionate as carbene precursor, trifluoroethyl amines/amine hydrochloride as the CF3CHN2 surrogate as well as trifluoro aldehydes/ketones N&#8208;sulfonylhydrazones as the trifluoro diazo compounds surrogate.</dc:description>

         <title>2&#8208; and 3&#8208;Fluorocyclobutane Building Blocks for Organic and Medicinal Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multigram synthesis of 3&#8208;fluorinated cyclobutane building blocks has been disclosed. The proposed synthetic schemes were based on the nucleophilic fluorination and eventually led to 3&#8208;fluorocyclocutanecarboxylic acid as a key target compound and intermediate. Further functional group transformations provided monofluorinated cyclobutane&#8208;derived alcohols, amines, bromides, thiols, sulfonyl chlorides, etc. Furthermore, the synthesis of diastereopure cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;isomeric 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;fluorocyclobutane&#173;carboxylic acids and amines was also performed. In both cases, diastereomer separation was used to obtain pure stereoisomers. The effect of the fluorine position and relative spatial orientation on the physicochemical properties of the corresponding monoflurinated derivatives was studied by measurements of pKa and logP values.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Functionalization of para&#8208;Quinones: A Historical Review and New Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct functionalization of quinones has always fascinated research communities due to their biological and redox activities and subsequent application. Quinone motifs play a vital role as precursors for many bioactive compounds and materials; hence, many ingenious methodologies have been elaborated for exploring these units. A significant part of the synthetic strategies towards the functionalized quinones has been achieved by installing substituents on hydroquinones, phenols, or quinone itself by different oxidative coupling reactions via radical pathways with or without the utilization of metal catalysts. The functionalization of simple quinones via direct C&#8208;H bond remains challenging due to their inherited electronic nature and high bond dissociation energy. This review article summarizes the recent advancement made for functionalized quinones through direct functionalization of simple quinones. Our primary focus will be on the synthetic approaches and mechanistic pathways of these reactions that have appeared in the last two decades, along with a short historical importance of the quinone family.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemistry in Organic Synthesis: An Italian Journey through Innovations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemistry, as an enabling technology, harnesses mechanical force to drive chemical reactions, presenting compelling advantages in organic synthesis within the principles of green chemistry.&#160;This review explores how its unique advantages and alignment with sustainable practices have been widely developed in different scientific fields in Italy. As a transformative strategy for organic synthesis, mechanochemistry has been portrayed in this review as a valuable synthetic alternative due to the various advantages, such as solvent reduction and new reaction pathways, that its use brings. Nonetheless, the improvements brought about by its use have also been crucial in other fields of chemistry described by Italian scientists. In this whole context, Italian researchers have analysed both already optimised processes and new feasible pathways, paving the way for new avenues previously hampered by all the limitations that belong to in&#8208;solution chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of a Cobalt Catalyst from ZIF&#8208;67 and Application in the Hydrogenation of N&#8208;Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogenation of N&#8208;heteroarenes to saturated N&#8208;heterocycles is an important reaction in organic synthesis. Hydrogen is a green&#8208;reducing reagent and has been widely applied in industrial production. The development of an appropriate catalyst to realize hydrogenation under low pressure and temperature is desired. In this study, we developed a cobalt&#8208;based catalyst derived from ZIF&#8208;67, and it exhibits high activity for N&#8208;heteroarene hydrogenation under 5&#8208;20 bar hydrogen, which is relatively low compared to reported catalytic systems. This nano&#8208;cobalt catalyst shows a broad substrate scope and can be reused without obvious activity loss.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Stability, Meisenheimer Complex Formation, and Charge&#8208;Transfer Properties of Ultra&#8208;Electron&#8208;Deficient Tetracyano&#8208;Naphthalene Diimides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetra&#8208;cyano substituted naphthalene diimides (TCNDIs) with calculated LUMO of &#8208;5.2 eV, form one of the strongest electron&#8208;acceptors known to date. However, the synthesis and isolation of this class of molecules remain challenging due to its reactivity emanating from its ultra&#8208;electron&#8208;deficiency. Herein we have established an improved synthetic methodology of TCNDIs with cost&#8208;effective reagents and circumventing metallic catalysts. The synthesis is amenable to TCNDIs with the shortest axial alkyl groups, i.e., methyl group and also longer alkyl chains. We also gained insight on how axial alkyl chain lengths influence electron&#8208;deficiency, Meisenheimer complex formation, reactivity, and charge&#8208;transfer of TCNDIs from computation, spectroscopy, and electrochemical studies. The TCNDIs with Me/Et axial groups were found to be more susceptible to moist solvents vis&#8208;&#224;&#8208;vis the TCNDIs with longer alkyl groups. The single crystal structures of the TCNDIs show infinitely &#960;&#8208;stacked structure, and a new C=O&#183;&#183;&#183;C&#8801;N or C&#8801;N&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; motif is discerned. Finally, toluene&#8208;mediated charge&#8208;transfer properties of TCNDIs in the single crystals as well as in solution have been examined.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Sulfo(xo)nium Diacylmethylides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfo(xo)nium diacylmethylides as stable and readily prepared sulfur ylides are versatile synthons. This concept article summarizes their synthetic methods, including the condensation of active methylene compounds with sulfides/sulfoxides, transylidations of diazo compounds and iodonium ylides with sulfides/sulfoxides, acylation of sulfo(xo)nium monoacylmethylides, and the reaction of electron&#8208;deficient alkynes and sulfoxides. Their substrate scopes, proposed mechanisms, selected product examples, limitations, and applications are discussed.







Abstract
Sulfo(xo)nium diacylmethylides (sulfur ylides) are simple, stable, readily prepared, and versatile synthons. Compared with the sulfo(xo)nium monoacylmethylides, they can be compatible with more rigorous reaction conditions and showcase unique characteristics due to their excellent stability. This concept article provides an account for the syntheses of sulfo(xo)nium diacylmethylides, including the utilization of active methylene compounds, carbene precursors, sulfo(xo)nium monoacylmethylides, and electron&#8208;deficient alkynes as substrates, with discussions on substrate scopes, proposed mechanisms, selected product examples, and applications. Challenges for further exploration and prospect on sulfo(xo)nium diacylmethylides in the future are also suggested.

         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free carbonyl reduction and hydrodefluorination of &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethyl enones with hydrosilanes was developed for the synthesis of a variety of gem&#8208;difluorovinyl alcohols. The hydrosilane could act as both a reductive agent and a C(sp3)&#8208;F bond&#8208;breaking promoter under mild reaction conditions. Synthetically useful organofluorides could be readily constructed by the further transformations of the obtained products.







Abstract
A tandem carbonyl reduction and hydrodefluorination of &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethyl enones with hydrosilanes under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions was developed for the synthesis of a variety of valuable gem&#8208;difluorovinyl alcohols. The hydrosilane could act as both a reductive agent and a C(sp3)&#8208;F bond&#8208;breaking promoter under mild reaction conditions. Synthetically useful organofluorides, such as gem&#8208;fluorophosphine alkene, gem&#8208;difluorovinyl ketone, and fluorinated dihydrofuran derivatives could be readily constructed by further transformations of the obtained gem&#8208;difluorovinyl alcohols. Moreover, the method features mild reaction conditions, operational simplicity, excellent functional group tolerance, and scalability.

         <title>Direct Introduction of an Acetyl Group at the &#945;&#8208;Carbon Atom of an Arene Ring through an Amide Photo&#8208;Fries Rearrangement upon Exposure to UV Light</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;Fries rearrangement using benzoheterocyclic compounds, which are widely used in pharmaceuticals, was studied. Under ultraviolet (UV) light, benzoheterocyclic compounds containing an N&#8208;acetyl group underwent rearrangement of the acyl group directly to the &#945;&#8208;position past the adjacent bridgehead carbon. This environmentally friendly method could be useful in organic synthesis, the pharmaceutical industry, and biochemistry.







Abstract
We employed an amide photo&#8208;Fries rearrangement for the synthesis benzoheterocyclic compounds and found that direct acylation of the &#945;&#8208;carbon atom in an arene ring can occur upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. In this reaction, the N&#8208;acetyl group of amides underwent rearrangement to the &#945;&#8208;position across the bridgehead carbon atom under UV&#8722;C light. The reaction conditions were gentle and safe. Moreover, this reaction proves to be more convenient for selectively manipulating benzoheterocyclic compounds in comparison to traditional approaches involving Lewis acid catalysts or anionic reagents.

         <title>Electrochemical Decarboxylative Addition of N&#8208;Aryl Glycines to Enaminones: Access to C3&#8208;Aminomethyl Chromones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical decarboxylative addition of N&#8208;substituted glycines to enaminones has been developed for the synthesis of C3&#8208;aminomethyl chromones. The products could be generated under oxidant&#8208;, catalyst&#8208;, and light&#8208;free conditions at room temperature, and could act as valuable building blocks to construct polysubstituted pyrimidines with potential bioactivities.







Abstract
An electrochemical decarboxylative addition of N&#8208;substituted glycines to enaminones has been developed and conducted under oxidant&#8208;, catalyst&#8208;, and light&#8208;free conditions in acetonitrile at room temperature by using electron as the traceless oxidant, which provided a green approach to C3&#8208;aminomethyl chromones.

&lt;p&gt;An electrochemical decarboxylative addition of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-substituted glycines to enaminones has been developed for the synthesis of C3-aminomethyl chromones. The products could be generated under oxidant-, catalyst-, and light-free conditions at room temperature, and could act as valuable building blocks to construct polysubstituted pyrimidines with potential bioactivities.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An electrochemical decarboxylative addition of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-substituted glycines to enaminones has been developed and conducted under oxidant-, catalyst-, and light-free conditions in acetonitrile at room temperature by using electron as the traceless oxidant, which provided a green approach to C3-aminomethyl chromones. The resulting products were formed through radical addition/oxidation/cyclization or electrophilic addition/cyclization pathway and could act as valuable building blocks to construct polysubstituted pyrimidine derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalysed syn&#8208;Selective Arylnickelation and Cyclisation of Ketone/Imine&#8208;Tethered Terminal Alkynes with Arylboronic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein the substrate scope of a nickel&#8208;catalysed syn&#8208;selective arylnickelation and cyclisation with arylboronic acids is expanded to include ketone and imine&#8208;tethered terminal alkynes. The reaction proceeds via a syn&#8208;aryl nickelation of a terminal alkyne followed by cyclisation of the resulting alkenylnickel species. Along with this the first enantioselective version of the reaction has been developed using PHIM type P,N ligands.







Abstract
Herein we report a syn&#8208;arylnickelative cyclisation with ketone&#8208; and imine&#8208;tethered terminal alkynes (16 examples) in yields of up to 89&#8201;%. The reaction proceeds via a syn&#8208;aryl nickelation of a terminal alkyne followed by cyclisation of the resulting alkenylnickel species onto the ketone or imine. The enantioselective version of this transformation has also been explored with enantioselectivities of up to 83&#8201;:&#8201;17&#8197;er observed.

Conducting the reaction under hydrosilylation conditions and blue light (2*24 W, 450&#8208;460 nm) in the presence of an iron(0) based pre&#8208;catalyst, Fe(CO)4(IMes), amines and alcohols were obtained, respectively, notably at ambient conditions, whereas using white light, higher reaction temperatures up to 100 &#176;C were required.

for Asymmetric Conjugate Cyanation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of asymmetric organic molecules has experienced a huge development over the last
few decades. Phase&#8208;transfer catalysis has been proven to be one of the most powerful methods
for these asymmetric transformations. However, the study of the mechanism of these catalysts and
the different interactions that they can establish with the reactants has failed to keep pace. In the
present study, the conjugate cyanation of two different &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones are studied in the
presence of a well&#8208;known alkaloid quinine&#8208;derived PTC, along with different modifications. The study
includes the comparison of different binding modes between the catalysts and the different reactants,
the mechanistic study of the reaction and the analysis of the non&#8208;covalent interactions established
within the complexes and their role in the global enantioselectivity of the process.</dc:description>

The Pd&#8208;catalysed decarboxylative asymmetric allylic alkylation (DAAA) of sterically hindered &#945;&#8208;aryl,&#946;&#8208;amido allyl ester lactams has been developed. The key step in the synthesis of a range of &#945;&#8208;aryl lactam substrates for catalysis was a Pb&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;arylation. A substrate scope of 11 examples of DAAA showed that products containing the di&#8208;ortho&#8208;methoxy&#8208;substituted phenyls and naphthyl groups gave rise to the highest enantioselctivities of up to 82&#8201;% ee.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Electrooxidative Annulation of Naphthol with Acrylate via C&#8722;H Bond Activation for the Synthesis of Naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]furan</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have sythesized naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]furan derivatives using iridium catalyzed electrochemical coupling of naphthol and acrylates. Ir&#8208;catalyzed oxidant&#8208;free electrochemical C&#8722;H annulation is achieved by electrooxidative C&#8722;H acrylation via weak O&#8208;coordination. This method does not require additives and external chemical oxidants in the syntheses of naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]furans.







Abstract
Iridium catalyzed electrochemical coupling of naphthols with acrylates for the syntheses of naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]furan derivatives are herein reported. Ir&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical C&#8722;H annulation is accomplished within a supportive catalysis manifold, paving the way for electrooxidative C&#8722;H acrylation via weak O&#8208;coordination. The merge of iridium catalysts and electric current not only minimizes the need for a stoichiometric amount of chemical oxidants but also confirms broad reaction compatibility with a variety of electronically and sterically diverse substrates.

     alt="Iridium-Catalyzed Electrooxidative Annulation of Naphthol with Acrylate via C&#8722;H Bond Activation for the Synthesis of Naphtho[1,8-bc]furan"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have sythesized naphtho[1,8-bc]furan derivatives using iridium catalyzed electrochemical coupling of naphthol and acrylates. Ir-catalyzed oxidant-free electrochemical C&#8722;H annulation is achieved by electrooxidative C&#8722;H acrylation via weak O-coordination. This method does not require additives and external chemical oxidants in the syntheses of naphtho[1,8-bc]furans.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iridium catalyzed electrochemical coupling of naphthols with acrylates for the syntheses of naphtho[1,8-bc]furan derivatives are herein reported. Ir-catalyzed electrochemical C&#8722;H annulation is accomplished within a supportive catalysis manifold, paving the way for electrooxidative C&#8722;H acrylation via weak O-coordination. The merge of iridium catalysts and electric current not only minimizes the need for a stoichiometric amount of chemical oxidants but also confirms broad reaction compatibility with a variety of electronically and sterically diverse substrates. This utility provides a valuable method for producing a wide range of naphtho[1,8-bc]furan derivatives in good to moderate yields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Oxidation of Sufur&#8208;Containing Flavones: Synthesis of Sulfoxide/Sulfone&#8208;Flavonoids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocol is proposed for the selective oxidation of flavones, providing various sulfoxide/sulfone&#8208;flavonoids in excellent yields. This strategy features excellent selectivities, high yields and broad substrate scope. The combination of oxone (2KHSO5&#183;KHSO4&#183;K2SO4) as the sole oxidant and NaHCO3/Na2CO3&#160;as the buffer play an important role in the process, in which the amounts of oxone and reaction temperatures are the key to the outstanding selectivities and high efficiency of the reaction. It should be noteworthy that a class of novel sulfone&#8208;flavonols is also synthesized through triple oxidation. Moreover, the glycosylation of sulfone&#8208;flavonols has been realized.</dc:description>

         <title>The Synthesis and Ring&#8208;closing Reactions of Aminocyclohexane Derivatives Bearing Unsaturated Side&#8208;chains at C2.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two epimeric pairs of N&#8208;Ts&#8208;protected cyclohexylamines that incorporate an unsaturated side&#8208;chain at the C2 position have been prepared. Contrary to expectations, none of these underwent clean, photochemically&#8208;induced intramolecular hydroamination reactions to give the corresponding perhydro&#8208;indole or &#8208;quinolines. However, they did participate in efficient olefin cross metathesis (OCM) reactions with methyl crotonate. Three of the four acrylates so&#8208;formed engaged in base&#8208;promoted and completely diastereoselective, intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition (cyclisation) reactions to give the isomeric and C2&#8208;substituted perhydro&#8208;indoles or &#8208;quinolines with the structures of these being confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analyses. DFT calculations generated results consistent with the observed diastereoselectivities and the proposed transition states. Manipulation of the ester groups associated with the cyclization products allowed for their conversion, inter alia, into the corresponding n&#8208;propyl residues and thus providing novel analogues of neurotoxic alkaloids such as pumiliotoxin C.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Remote Selective C(sp3)&#8208;H Alkylation Mediated by Cesium formate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we developed a photoinduced remote selective C(sp3)&#8722;H alkylation of protected amines in the presence of cesium formate. The protected amines were synthesized from commercially available inexpensive 2&#8208;iodo benzoyl chloride. Under mild reaction conditions, the in situ generated aryl radical is converted to alpha&#8208;amidoalkyl radical via [1,5]&#8208;HAT process, which combines with different Michael acceptors and affords corresponding alkylation products in good yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that formate anion acts as a source of carbon dioxide radical anion (CO2&#8226;&#8722;) and hydrogen atom donor was directly confirmed by isotope&#8208;labeling studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Imidazolium Dicyanomethylides as N&#8208;Ylide Precursors of Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazolium&#8208;ylides are conjugated mesomeric betaines with an exocyclic anionic carbon substituent. These ylides were converted by deprotonation into anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, which can be formulated with two negative charges on the carbene carbon atom due to their origin. Subsequent reaction with selenium gave anionic selenourea compounds.







Abstract
In the past, the use of nitrogen ylides focused primarily on cycloadditions, where the 1,3&#8208;dipole was used as a building block for the formation of heterocycles such as pyrroles or pyrrolinones. In this work, we present a new perspective on imidazolium dicyanomethylides with their synthesis and utilization as anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). The values of relative carbene formation energies (CREF) for a wide range of substituted imidazolium ylides unknown in the literature showed promising properties. In situ trapping reactions of these anionic NHCs with selenium led to anionic, water&#8208;soluble compounds that exhibited remarkable coordination behavior according to X&#8208;ray structure analyses. In addition, the 77Se shifts of the investigated compounds were measured to draw conclusions about their &#960;&#8208;acceptance.

In addition, the &lt;sup&gt;77&lt;/sup&gt;Se shifts of the investigated compounds were measured to draw conclusions about their &#960;-acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Hydroquinone Linked 3,3&#8217;&#8208;Steroid Dimers via a Modified Mitsunobu Protocol</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient one&#8208;step procedure for the synthesis of O,O&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene&#8208;linked saturated steroid dimers through a modified Mitsunobu protocol is described. The formation of hydroquinone dialkyl ethers from secondary alcohols (steroidal or nonsteroidal) requires the use of a three&#8208;component PBu3/TMAD/Et3N system in a non&#8208;polar solvent. This method allows for the synthesis of a wide range of products with potential biological activity.







Abstract
A successful approach for the construction of steroid dimers with a hydroquinone linker under PBu3/TMAD/Et3N/toluene conditions is described. This study provided a new one&#8208;step methodology for the design and synthesis of bis&#8208;steroidal 1,4&#8208;phenylene diethers using mild and effective reagents.

         <title>Towards the Stable Binding of Mercury: Synthesis and Functionalization of Dibenzyldiazabicyclononane Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A universally applicable synthesis route for the preparation of functionalized diazabicyclononane compounds was elaborated starting from a readily available 1,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;3,7&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1] nonan&#8208;9&#8208;ol by alkylation of both secondary amines with modified benzyl residues containing a bromo, trimethylstannyl, trimethylsilyl, and pinacolboranyl residue. High yields (65&#8208;88%) were achieved, supporting the intended purpose of these compounds: efficient mercuration reactions to stably bind Hg2+. Finally, the C&#8208;9 position of two functionalized diazabicyclononanes was further modified by introducing an azide functionality. This enables the conjugation to biomolecules of interest via click chemistry combined with a tracking by the introduced mercury isotopes.</dc:description>

         <title>Systematic Investigation of Optical and Chiroptical Properties of Chiral &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Oligomers in Solution and Thin Films</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic investigation of four different families of structurally&#8208;related chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated oligomers, prepared by synthetic strategies involving Palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling protocols, was performed in chloroform solution (absorbance, photoluminescence) and spin&#8208;coated thin films (absorbance, photoluminescence, ECD, optical microscopy).







Abstract
Four families of structurally related chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated oligomers bearing a hydroquinone (HQ), 1,5&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene (Naph), benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophene&#8208;4,8&#8208;diol (BDT) or 9H&#8208;carbazole (CBZ) central core, for a total of 11 new compounds, have been synthesized by simple and versatile synthetic strategies involving Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling protocols: a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction, a Sonogashira/desilylation/Sonogashira sequence or a Sonogashira/desilylation/acyl Sonogashira sequence. A systematic investigation of the optical and chiroptical features of the final chiral dyes was performed in chloroform solution and on spin&#8208;coated thin films. The ECD investigation was crucial in revealing that, even within the same family of organic dyes, minor variations in the nature and length of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone can result in very different solid&#8208;state arrangements at different hierarchical scales.

         <title>Hypersensitive Inhibition of Organocatalysts by Halide Salts: Are Two Catalysts Involved in the Mannich Reaction?</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Can you kill two catalysts with one chloride? Thiourea/urea catalysts are sensitive to inhibition by chloride salts, but here we find that they appear to be too sensitive. Are two catalysts inhibited by a single chloride ion, or are there two catalysts involved in the reaction? Our kinetic detective story suggests the latter!







Abstract
Conformationally flexible tertiary amine &#8211; thiourea&#8722;urea catalysts 1 and 2 for the Mannich reaction between imines and malonate esters are efficiently inhibited by quaternary ammonium halides. NMR titrations, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and NOE experiments showed that the catalysts bind chloride and bromide ions with relatively high affinities (K=103&#8211;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 in acetonitrile). The halide ions not only block the active site of the catalysts, but they also induce refolding into catalytically inactive conformations upon complexation in an allosteric&#8208;like event. At substoichiometric inhibitor:catalyst ratios, the catalysts displayed hypersensitivity to the inhibitors, with overall rates that were lower than those expected from simple 1st order kinetics and 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inhibitor:catalyst stoichiometry. To rationalize the observed hypersensitivity, different kinetic scenarios were examined. For catalyst 2 and the Takemoto catalyst (6), the data is consistent with 2nd order dependency on catalyst concentration, suggesting that a mechanism involving only a single catalyst in the catalytic cycle is not operative. For catalyst 1, an alternative scenario involving 1st order in catalyst and catalyst poisoning at low concentrations of 1 could also rationalize the hypersensitivity. Interestingly, inhibition of catalysts 1 and 2 by halide salts led to significant loss of enantioselectivity, in contrast to the Takemoto catalyst 6 which was inhibited but with essentially no change in enantioselectivity.

     alt="Hypersensitive Inhibition of Organocatalysts by Halide Salts: Are Two Catalysts Involved in the Mannich Reaction?"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you kill two catalysts with one chloride? Thiourea/urea catalysts are sensitive to inhibition by chloride salts, but here we find that they appear to be &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt; sensitive. Are two catalysts inhibited by a single chloride ion, or are there two catalysts involved in the reaction? Our kinetic detective story suggests the latter!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conformationally flexible tertiary amine &#8211; thiourea&#8722;urea catalysts &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; for the Mannich reaction between imines and malonate esters are efficiently inhibited by quaternary ammonium halides. NMR titrations, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and NOE experiments showed that the catalysts bind chloride and bromide ions with relatively high affinities (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;=10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in acetonitrile). The halide ions not only block the active site of the catalysts, but they also induce refolding into catalytically inactive conformations upon complexation in an allosteric-like event. At substoichiometric inhibitor:catalyst ratios, the catalysts displayed hypersensitivity to the inhibitors, with overall rates that were lower than those expected from simple 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order kinetics and 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inhibitor:catalyst stoichiometry. To rationalize the observed hypersensitivity, different kinetic scenarios were examined. For catalyst &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and the Takemoto catalyst (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;), the data is consistent with 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order dependency on catalyst concentration, suggesting that a mechanism involving only a single catalyst in the catalytic cycle is not operative. For catalyst &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, an alternative scenario involving 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order in catalyst and catalyst poisoning at low concentrations of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; could also rationalize the hypersensitivity. Interestingly, inhibition of catalysts &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; by halide salts led to significant loss of enantioselectivity, in contrast to the Takemoto catalyst &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; which was inhibited but with essentially no change in enantioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of 3&#8208;Substituted Phthalides via Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Ring Opening of Aziridines with Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A BF3&#8901;OEt2&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular ring opening of ester&#8208;functionalized aziridines has been developed for the general and efficient construction of 3&#8208;substituted phthalides. Broad substrate scope, good yields and mild conditions made the cyclization reaction very suitable for the rapid construction of libraries of 3&#8208;substituted phthalide compounds.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Branch&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Alkylation of Indoles and Azoles with Alkenes: An Additive&#8208; and Solvent&#8208;Free Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward nickel&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the C&#8722;H alkylation of indoles and azoles is disclosed that proceeds under additive&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free conditions. The reaction utilizes readily available alkenes as alkylating partners and delivers Markovnikov products with tolerance of sensitive functionalities.







Abstract
The development of sustainable protocols for the synthesis of alkylated heteroarenes is crucial owing to their widespread existence in medicinally relevant and bioactive natural products. Herein, we describe an efficient, additive&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free approach for the regioselective C&#8722;H alkylation of indoles and azoles with alkenes using a nickel catalyst, which proceeds through a chelation&#8208;assistance strategy. The reaction exclusively provided branched alkylated products with the compatibility of alkyl, alkoxy, fluoro, trifluoromethyl, alkene, cyano, ester, and carbonyl groups. This protocol is applicable to other heteroarenes, such as imidazoles and benzimidazoles, providing the desired alkylated products with exclusive Markovnikov selectivity. The synthetic utility and scale&#8208;up of the reaction are demonstrated, and the protocol is in concord with the principles of green chemistry. Alkylation proceeds through facile and reversible C&#8722;H nickelation and alkene insertion processes, presumably involving rate&#8208;limiting reductive elimination.

         <title>Structural and Electronic Impacts of the Axial Substitution at the Phosphorus Center of C(sp3)&#8208;Bridged P&#8208;Heterotriangulenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematic functionalization of the phosphorus center in the bowl&#8208;shaped dimethylmethylene&#8208;bridged P&#8208;heterotriangulene allowed efficient modulation of its optoelectronic and structural properties. Thorough experimental and theoretical studies revealed the relationship between the s&#8208;character of the P&#8722;X bond and the bowl depth. The compounds form co&#8208;crystals with C60.







Abstract
The structural and electronic properties of the dimethylmethylene&#8208;bridged P&#8208;heterotriangulene have been systematically modulated by functionalization of its phosphorus center. The optoelectronic properties of the obtained derivatives in solution were characterized by UV/Vis absorption and emission spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and 31P NMR spectroscopy. The solid state structures were analyzed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The experimental results were corroborated by density functional theory calculations which revealed the crucial influence of the axial substitution on the bowl&#8208;shaped geometry of the phosphorus&#8208;centered polycyclic scaffold, which is proportional to the s&#8208;character of the P&#8722;X bond. The advantage of the bowl&#8208;shaped P&#8208;heterotriangulene scaffold was demonstrated by successful co&#8208;crystallization with fullerene C60.

New furan, carvone and limonene&#8208;based carbamates have been synthesized with high regioselectivity under solvent&#8208;free and mild reaction conditions. Moreover, a detailed study on the reaction conditions allowed for the drastic reduction of the TBD loading with almost no effect on the regioselectivity.







Abstract
The regioselective synthesis of carbamates from bio&#8208;derived cyclic carbonates and amines by using 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD) as an organocatalyst is reported. This methodology led to the preparation of a wide range of bio&#8208;sourced hydroxyurethanes from furan&#8208;, carvone&#8208; and limonene&#8208;based scaffolds under solvent&#8208;free and mild reaction conditions. Moreover, a comprehensive analysis of the process allowed us to optimize the catalyst loading with little or no impact on the process regioselectivity.

         <title>Synthesis of a Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane&#8208;Containing Aromatic Lipoxin B4 Analogue and Heteroaromatic Congeners</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the asymmetric synthesis of an aromatic analogue of lipoxin B4 containing a conformationally rigid and potentially more metabolically resistant bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) ring incorporated into the upper alkyl chain. This was achieved via the design of a key BCP&#8208;containing fragment that could be used as a common intermediate in the synthesis of the target analogue as well as other heteroaromatic congeners.







Abstract
Lipoxins are pro&#8208;resolving mediators that play an important role in the resolution phase of the innate inflammatory response. However, because of their chemical and metabolic instability, the design of more stable synthetic analogues of lipoxin A4 and lipoxin B4 is an ongoing area of study. Herein we report the asymmetric synthesis of an aromatic lipoxin B4 analogue containing a conformationally rigid and potentially more metabolically resistant bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) ring incorporated into the upper alkyl chain. This was achieved by the development of a 9&#8208;step chiral&#8208;pool synthesis of a novel BCP&#8208;containing boronic ester coupling partner which could serve as a common precursor to the target analogue as well as other analogues with further modifications to the aromatic core.

         <title>Polymorphism and White Light Emission of 1&#8208;Bromo&#8208;3,5,7&#8208;triphenyladamantane Compared with 1,3,5,7&#8208;Tetraphenyladamantane</title>

         <dc:description>
Substituted diamondoid polymorphs were identified and show different white&#8208;light emission spectra upon continuous infrared laser irradiation. The polymorphicity arises from a competition of London dispersion interactions either as short CH&#8211;&#960; or Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br contacts.







Abstract
Here we report our investigation of 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,5,7&#8208;triphenyladamantane (1) and the elucidation of polymorphic crystals (1&#8201;A and 1&#8201;B) using single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. In the monoclinic crystal system of 1&#8201;A (P21/n), we observed CH&#8211;&#960; interactions, while Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br interactions are absent. Conversely, the Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br interactions are an apparent factor in the formation of the monoclinic crystal system of 1&#8201;B (R
). We compare our findings with 1,3,5,7&#8208;tetraphenyladamantane (2), characterized by numerous CH&#8211;&#960; interactions in the solid. Computational analyses were employed to investigate the interactions within the characteristic dimers present in the unit cells of 1&#8201;A and 1&#8201;B, including visualization of noncovalent interactions and the use of the atoms&#8208;in&#8208;molecules approach as well as MO analyses. These support the notion of London dispersion (LD) dimer&#8208;dimer interactions in 1&#8201;A between the phenyl moieties, whereas 1&#8201;B exhibits additional dimer&#8208;dimer Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br contacts. In contrast, the crystals of 2 are exclusively held together by CH&#8211;&#960; stacking LD interactions, a feature absent in the polymorphs of 1. Both polymorphic forms of 1 emit white light when subjected to 900&#8197;nm continuous wave laser irradiation, displaying a subtle blue shift compared to 2. The absence of CH&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions between the dimers of 1 causes a small red&#8208;shift in the emission spectrum.

         <title>Aerobic Photoredox Catalyzed Oxamate Ester Synthesis from Bromodifluoroacetate Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel synthetic method for oxamate esters using bromodifluoroacetate esters and amines under aerobic photoredox catalysis. In contrast to previous methods that require the use of moisture&#8208;sensitive precursors and/or harsh conditions, this method utilizes bench&#8208;stable bromodifluoroacetate esters as an oxamate ester precursor under mild conditions, providing a variety of oxamate esters.







Abstract
Here we report an aerobic photoredox catalysis approach to oxamate ester synthesis using bromodifluoroacetate esters and amines under open&#8208;air conditions. Oxamate ester is an important skeleton found in bioactive molecules and used as a synthetic building block. However, previous synthetic methods require the use of moisture&#8208; and air&#8208;sensitive precursors and/or harsh conditions, limiting accessible oxamate esters. The present method uses bench&#8208;stable bromodifluoroacetate esters and amines under mild photoredox catalytic conditions to furnish a wide variety of oxamate esters. Combining photoredox catalysis with aerobic oxygenation enables the use of bromodifluoroacetate ester as a precursor for the synthesis of oxamate esters via fluoroglyoxylate esters.
