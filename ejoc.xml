      <title>Three&#8208;Component Synthesis of 2&#8208;Subsituted Thiobenzoazoles using Tetramethyl Thiuram Monosulfide (TMTM) as Thiocarbonyl Surrogate</title>

      <dc:description>Molecules bearing three primary amine groups are ubiquitous substances in various fields of synthetic chemistry. Some of them are commercially available and the rests are emerged from the designed protocols of synthetic chemists. It has been observed that such aliphatic as well as aromatic triamines are excellent precursors for the design and synthesis of various cage molecules of which organic imine cages (OICs) and related amine macrocycles belong to the category of special interest. These compounds possess unique architectures and already made their marks in the territory of supramolecular chemistry, synthetic methodology, and material science.

Theoretical DFT calculations of formation energies verified high thermodynamic stability of the isolated chlorides. Further chlorination produces Th&#8208;C60Cl24 and, eventually, non&#8208;IPR chlorides, 1805C60Cl24 and 1794C60Cl20. as a result of cage rearrangements.

      <title>Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution (SNAr) and Related Reactions of Porphyrinoids: Mechanistic and Regiochemical Aspects</title>
      <dc:description>The nucleophilic substitution of aromatic moieties (S  N  Ar) has been known for over 150 years and found wide use for the functionalization of (hetero)aromatic systems. At current, several &#8216;types&#8217; of S  N  Ar reactions have been established and notably the area of porphyrinoid macrocycles has seen many uses thereof. Herein we detail the reaction of seven types of porphyrinoids with differing number and type of pyrrole units: subporphyrins, norcorroles, corroles, porphyrins, azuliporphyrins, N&#8208;confused porphyrins, and phthalocyanines. For each we analyze the substitution dependent upon: a) the type of nucleophile and b) the site of substitution (&#945;, &#946;, or meso). Along with this we evaluate this route as a synthetic strategy for the generation of unsymmetrical porphyrinoids. Distinct trends can be identified for each type of porphyrinoid discussed, regardless of nucleophile. The use of nucleophilic substitution on porphyrinoids is found to often be a cost&#8208;effective procedure with the ability to yield complex substituent patterns, which can be conducted in non&#8208;anhydrous solvents with easily accessible simple porphyrinoids.</dc:description>

      <title>Molecular Switches and Motors Powered by Orthogonal Stimuli</title>
      <dc:description>Synthetic molecular machines are designed to undergo specific nanoscale movements in response to specific physical or chemical stimuli. The &#8220;engines&#8221; of molecular machines responsible for their motion are usually presented by molecular switches and motors that undergo predetermined shape transformations upon appropriate stimulation. Various types of molecular switches and motors activated by different stimuli, such as light irradiation or chemical input, have been devised and used as the core of mechanically active molecular systems. However, despite extensive research, the structural and functional complexity of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthetic molecular machines does not rival that of biological or human&#8208;scale counterparts. The most apparent difference is that current molecular machines show only limited modes of translational, rotational, and oscillatory motion that are typically triggered by a single stimulus. A promising strategy for achieving more elaborate movement is to integrate multiple active parts that can be manipulated by orthogonal stimuli. However, this approach is often complicated by mutual interference between the components or between stimuli. In this review, we survey recent notable progress in the development of molecular switches and motors that exhibit distinct modes of movement triggered by orthogonal stimuli. Though this approach is challenging, it may provide insights about the innovation needed to develop next&#8208;generation molecular machines with improved maneuverability and more sophisticated functions.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synthetic molecular machines are designed to undergo specific nanoscale movements in response to specific physical or chemical stimuli. The &#8220;engines&#8221; of molecular machines responsible for their motion are usually presented by molecular switches and motors that undergo predetermined shape transformations upon appropriate stimulation. Various types of molecular switches and motors activated by different stimuli, such as light irradiation or chemical input, have been devised and used as the core of mechanically active molecular systems. However, despite extensive research, the structural and functional complexity of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthetic molecular machines does not rival that of biological or human&#8208;scale counterparts. The most apparent difference is that current molecular machines show only limited modes of translational, rotational, and oscillatory motion that are typically triggered by a single stimulus. A promising strategy for achieving more elaborate movement is to integrate multiple active parts that can be manipulated by orthogonal stimuli. However, this approach is often complicated by mutual interference between the components or between stimuli. In this review, we survey recent notable progress in the development of molecular switches and motors that exhibit distinct modes of movement triggered by orthogonal stimuli. Though this approach is challenging, it may provide insights about the innovation needed to develop next&#8208;generation molecular machines with improved maneuverability and more sophisticated functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Thiourea&#8208;tertiary amine Promoted Cascade Catalysis: A Tool for Complexity Generation</title>
      <dc:description>The bifunctional organocatalyst promoted, relay&#8208;cascade catalysis (use of a single catalyst capable of promoting each catalytic cycle in the designed cascade process) has been the hot area of research in recent times, as it enables the green synthesis of complex molecular architectures in an atom, cost and step&#8208;economic fashion. In this context we summarized the recent developments (for last fifteen years) in the area of the thiourea&#8211;  tert  &#8208;amine based cascade catalysis in the current review article. The discussion was divided into three subsections,  viz  . double&#8208;, triple&#8208; and quadruple cascades depending on the number of individual steps involved in the cascade process. In each type there are various combinations of reactions like Michael addition, aldol reaction, Henry reaction, Knoevenagel reaction, cyclization, trans&#8208;esterifications etc. Divergent polycyclic structural frameworks have been achieved employing this cascade catalytic strategy as evidenced in this review. We assume that the current review article would be a handle for the design and development as well as further growth of this potential greener approach.</dc:description>

Stepwise sulfur extrusion from the self&#8208;assembled disulfides to, first, thioethers, and then to hydrocarbons by photochemically promoted routes, gives rise to a collection of 7 new thioether and hydrocarbon cyclophanes related to the venerable family of [n]paracyclophanes. These methods provide an efficient self&#8208;assembly approach to the synthesis of hydrocarbon macrocycles (related to carbon &#8220;nanohoops&#8221;), a class of structures that are typically formed in lengthier, stepwise syntheses.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of constrained C&#8208;glycosyl amino acid derivatives involving 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of cyclic nitrone as key step</title>

After optimization of 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition conditions, various  C  &#8208;vinylglycosides were tested leading exclusively to one diastereoisomer of the corresponding cycloadduct in good to excellent yields.

      <title>Hypervalent Iodine&#8208;Mediated Styrene Hetero&#8208; and Homodimerization Initiation Proceeds with Two&#8208;Electron Reductive Cleavage</title>
      <dc:description>A mechanistic insight into the hetero&#8208; and homodimerizations (HETD and HOMD) of styrenes promoted by hypervalent iodine reagents (HVIRs;  DMP  and  PIDA  ) and facilitated by hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) to yield all  trans  cyclobutanes is reported using density functional theory (DFT) calculations.  The initialization involving direct bimolecular one&#8208;electron transfer is found to be highly unfavored, especially for the  PIDA  system. At this point, we suggest that the reaction is initiated with an overall two&#8208;electron reductive cleavage of two I&#9472;O bond cleavages, affording I(III) (iodinane) and I(I) (iodobenzene) product with DMP and PIDA as oxidant, respectively. The resulting acetate groups are stabilized by the solvent HFIP through strong hydrogen bonding interaction, which promotes the electron transfer process. The nature of the electron transfer is studied in detail and found that the overall two&#8208;electron transfer occurs within tri&#8208;molecular complex organized by &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions and as a stepwise and concerted mechanism for I(III) and I(V) oxidants, respectively. The reaction rate is determined by the initialization step: for I(III), the initiation is thermodynamically endergonic, whereas the endergonicity for I(V) is modest. Upon initialization, the reaction proceeds through a stepwise [2+2] pathway, involving a radical&#8208;cationic &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacked transition states, where the HOMD is dynamically competing pathway to HETD although the latter is relatively faster.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows the receiver&#8208;transmitter properties of &#8220;heterodyad&#8208;satellites&#8221; derived from hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) and tetrabenzoporphyrin (TBP). Owing to the efficient light absorptivity of both &#8220;satellites&#8221;, a broad range of signals from the near&#8208;UV up to the near&#8208;IR of the solar spectrum can be received. By excited energy transfer from the HBC antennae to the TBP core, the received input is &#8220;deconvoluted&#8221; to the emission of near&#8208;IR signals, which are transmitted by the &#8220;satellites&#8221;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Cover Feature&lt;/b&gt; shows the receiver&#8208;transmitter properties of &#8220;heterodyad&#8208;satellites&#8221; derived from hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) and tetrabenzoporphyrin (TBP). Owing to the efficient light absorptivity of both &#8220;satellites&#8221;, a broad range of signals from the near&#8208;UV up to the near&#8208;IR of the solar spectrum can be received. By excited energy transfer from the HBC antennae to the TBP core, the received input is &#8220;deconvoluted&#8221; to the emission of near&#8208;IR signals, which are transmitted by the &#8220;satellites&#8221;.

      <dc:description>Desymmetrization of meso compounds is well recognized as a powerful method for delivering biologically relevant molecular skeletons in a few synthetic steps. Heterobicyclic olefins are a class of meso compounds which exhibit exceptional reactivity due to its high ring strain originating from the unfavorable bond angles and eclipsing interactions. Extensive research was carried out towards the synthetic transformations of oxa&#8208;, aza&#8208; and diaza&#8208;norbornenes/ norbornadienes for the synthesis of a wide variety of carbocycles and heterocycles in a single step, most importantly in a stereo&#8208; and chemo&#8208;selective manner. This review summarizes the relevant aspects of diazanorbornene reactivity which will inspire the synthetic community for exploiting these highly strained bicyclic systems for the creation of extensive libraries of novel structurally and biologically interesting molecules.

      <title>Catalytic selective oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols using nonheme [Iron(III)(Pyridine&#8208;Containing Ligand)] complexes</title>
      <dc:description>The selective oxidation of different primary and secondary alcohols to carbonyl compounds by hydrogen peroxide was found to be catalysed in conversion ranging from good to excellent by an iron(III) complex of a pyridine&#8208;containing macrocyclic ligand (Pc&#8208;L), without the need of any additive. The choice of the counteranion (Cl, Br, OTf) appeared to be of fundamental importance and the best results in terms of selectivity (up to 99%) and conversion (up to 98%) were obtained using the well characterised [Fe(III)(Br)2(Pc&#8208;L)]Br complex,  4c  . Magnetic moments in solid state, also confirmed in solution (d6  &#8208;DMSO) by Evans NMR method, were calculated and point out to an iron metal centre in the high spin state of 5/2. The crystal structure shows that the iron(III) centre is coordinated by the four nitrogen atoms of the macrocycle and two bromide anions to form a distorted octahedral coordination environment. The catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol in acetonitrile was found occurring with better conversions and selectivities than in other solvents. The reaction proved to be quite general, tolerating aromatic and aliphatic alcohols, although very low yields were obtained for terminal aliphatic alcohols. Preliminary mechanistic studies are in agreement with a catalytic cycle promoted by a high&#8208;spin iron complex.</dc:description>

      <title>Biomedical Hydrogels Fabricated Using Diels Alder Crosslinking</title>
      <dc:description>The Diels Alder (DA) cycloaddition is one of the best methods for biomaterials conjugation to generate tools for biomedical applications.

In this review we provide an overview on the recent examples in which the DA cycloaddition has been exploited in nanomedicine. Nanoparticles for drug delivery or diagnosis, and nanostructured biomaterials for regenerative medicine, have been efficiently generated exploiting the DA reaction to crosslink the polymeric components, in order to obtain nanoparticles or scaffolds with the required chemical and morphological properties, and to conjugate targeting agents or signalling molecules</dc:description>

      <title>The Cyclization of Allenyl&#8208;Substituted Hydroxylamines to&#160;1,2&#8208;Oxazines: An Experimental and Computational Study</title>
      <dc:description>To gain a deeper understanding of the formation of the synthetically important 3,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazines, the 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization of allenyl&#8208;substituted hydroxylamines was experimentally investigated in detail employing a model compound. The solvent effect was moderate with respect to the rate, but crucial to suppress side&#8208;product formation. Surprisingly, acids or bases had no big influence on the cyclization rate. With O&#8208;deuterated allenyl hydroxylamine a high primary isotope effect was found, indicating that the proton transfer is crucial in the rate determining step. DFT calculations evidence that the allenyl&#8208;substituted hydroxylamine is converted into an energetically similar zwitterionic intermediate with an allyl cation subunit. It cyclizes to the 1,2&#8208;oxazine as the most stable species. Alternative pathways starting from the zwitterion were computationally investigated. Interestingly, it can also undergo a fragmentation to give a pentadiene derivative and a nitroso compound. The hetero Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of these components may also deliver the 1,2&#8208;oxazine. To evaluate an alternative mechanistic scenario, calculations of the protonated allenyl&#8208;substituted hydroxylamine were also performed.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Spongidepsin and Analogs</title>
      <dc:description>
  Spongidepsin is a macrolide isolated from Spongia sp. Owing to its original structure, exhibiting a phenylalanine amino acid moiety in a macrocycle and the presence of a terminal alkyne, associated to its antiproliferative activity, the molecule has attracted synthetic chemists culminating in seven total and/or formal syntheses. The major differences in the syntheses rely on the methods used to synthesize the C1&#8211;C5, the C6&#8211;C11, or C6&#8211;13 fragments as their connectivities to access spongidepsin are similar. The different methods to synthesize spongidepsin are compared.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Seven syntheses of (&#8211;)&#8208;spongidepsin, a natural product isolated from Spongia sp. with moderate antiproliferative activity, are described and the different analogs obtained during these syntheses are reported. A comparison between the different syntheses has been achieved.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gold(III) coordination of new chiral polydentate (  N,)N,O  &#8208;pyridine based ligands is reported. Successful coordination afforded novel chiral  N,N,O  &#8208;tridentate Au(III) complexes with the 2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;6&#8208;(  1S,2S,5R  )&#8208;neomenthol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;pyridine ligand (  1  H,  13  C,  15  N NMR, HRMS, IR, XRD).&#160;The chiral 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;6&#8208;alkylpyridine alcohol ligands were prepared from 2,6&#8208;dibromopyridine by initial stereoselective addition to (&#8208;)&#8208;menthone and (+)&#8208;camphor, respectively, and subsequent Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling with a series arylboronic acids. Testing of catalytic activity in propargyl cyclopropanation demonstrated that the new  N,N,O  &#8208;ligated gold(III) complex was highly catalytic active and outperformed AuCl  3  .&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Decade of Muricatacin Synthesis and Beyond</title>
      <dc:description>
  Various syntheses of both the muricatacin enantiomers and analogues adopting different strategies in the last decade are described in this review. Additionaly, the strategic use of muricatacin as starting point in synthesis of reticulatacin, cis&#8208;solamins and giganin is covered.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  In this review, we have abstracted the various syntheses of both enantiomers of muricatacin (a member of a bigger class of acetogenins, ACGs), over the last decade (2010&#8211;2020). Developments in the synthesis of various epimers, homologues, oxa&#8208;analogues, &#948;&#8208;lactones, and the furofuranone analogues are also enfolded in this review. Most of the synthesis involve chiral pool and catalytic enantioselective approaches, while a few are hinged on the use of chiral auxiliary and resolution methods. Muricatacin with orthogonally differentiated two oxy&#8208;functions also serve as a start point in the synthesis of higher molecules of the acetogenin family, for example, cis&#8208;solamins, and these have also been covered herein.

      <title>From Natural Compounds to Bioactive Molecules through NMR and In Silico Methodologies</title>
      <dc:description>
  Natural products are a privileged class of compounds with high diversity which are suitable for inspiring new rationally designed multi&#8208;target drugs. Herein, a multi&#8208;disciplinary approach that covers the structural and pharmacological characterization of NPs for developing semisynthetic and synthetic derivatives with optimized potency/selectivity towards specific targets in the inflammatory/cancer field is proposed.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Marine and terrestrial organisms are an unlimited source of active secondary metabolites. They are characterized by high chemical diversity, biochemical specificity, and other molecular features that make them a valid starting point for lead generation in the drug discovery process. Considering the complex structural architecture and the high number of stereogenic centers, compared to the synthetic drugs, the elucidation of the 2D structure and the assessment of the precise 3D arrangements of natural products (NPs) provide essential insights into ligand&#8208;target interaction which can drive a rational lead optimization process. In this regard, the combination of NMR spectroscopy with modern computational techniques represents one of the most effective approaches to achieve this task. The DFT/NMR integrated method, and its application, in combination with the accurate ROE&#8208;distance analysis, have been employed as valid support, both to clarify the configuration and conformational profile of the active secondary metabolites and to shed more light on the molecular basis of their mechanism of action. Indeed, the comprehension at a molecular level of their interactions with specific targets involved in pathologies, like inflammation and cancer, represents a cornerstone for further investigations through computational tools like molecular docking and molecular dynamics. These high&#8208;efficiency in silico techniques play a crucial part in the drug discovery process as well as in lead optimization procedures. Furthermore, this integrated approach provides the identification of novel chemical platforms disclosing new bioactive molecules with enhanced potency and selectivity.

      <title>Regioselective Olefination of 3&#8208;Substituted Five&#8208;Membered Heteroarenes</title>
      <dc:description>
  Achieving site selectivity in the olefination of heteroarenes constitutes a highly attractive yet often challenging synthetic target. Herein we discuss the development of catalyst systems for the regioselective functionalization of 3&#8208;substituted five&#8208;membered heteroarenes, which constitute particularly challenging substrates due to competing effects favoring different positions and are therefore attractive systems to prove strategies in catalyst design.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Five&#8208;membered heteroarenes constitute ubiquitous moieties in bioactive compounds and materials. It is thus not surprising that a direct and selective access to multiply substituted heteroarenes is considered as a highly attractive synthetic target. The direct olefination of such substrates, also known as cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling has raised significant interest in this context. However, achieving site&#8208;selectivity remains challenging with some substitution patterns such as 3&#8208;substituted heteroarenes. Suitable catalyst systems and reaction conditions have to be identified, which enable the differentiation between the competing C2&#8208; and C5&#8208;position. Over the last few years, substantial progress has been made to overcome this selectivity challenge mainly based on the use of novel ligand systems, which will be described herein.

      <title>Determination of the Absolute Configurations of Chiral Alkanes &#8211; An Analysis of the Available Tools</title>
      <dc:description>
  Handy it is to know how to determine the absolute configurations of even the most challenging chiral molecules, in particular alkanes, which are reviewed here. An evaluation of common analytical methods for absolute configuration determination provides a guide for experimental chemists to analyze their own molecules of interest.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Knowledge of absolute configurations (ACs) is crucial to understand the properties and functions of chiral molecules. Although the development of asymmetric reactions has enabled access to a large variety of enantioenriched compounds, stereochemical assignments of chiral molecules, especially chiral alkanes, remain challenging. In this Minireview, we first summarize common analytical techniques for AC determination with a focus on chiral alkanes as analytical targets. Next, we describe some of our efforts over the last 20 years on syntheses and AC determination of chiral alkanes including [123]tetramantane, hexadeuterated neopentane, and trans&#8208;perhydroazulene. Lastly, microscopic techniques and the crystalline sponge method are discussed as particularly promising approaches to revolutionize the field of stereochemical analysis.

     alt="Determination of the Absolute Configurations of Chiral Alkanes &#8211; An Analysis of the Available Tools"/&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Handy it is&lt;/b&gt; to know how to determine the absolute configurations of even the most challenging chiral molecules, in particular alkanes, which are reviewed here. An evaluation of common analytical methods for absolute configuration determination provides a guide for experimental chemists to analyze their own molecules of interest.
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Knowledge of absolute configurations (ACs) is crucial to understand the properties and functions of chiral molecules. Although the development of asymmetric reactions has enabled access to a large variety of enantioenriched compounds, stereochemical assignments of chiral molecules, especially chiral alkanes, remain challenging. In this Minireview, we first summarize common analytical techniques for AC determination with a focus on chiral alkanes as analytical targets. Next, we describe some of our efforts over the last 20 years on syntheses and AC determination of chiral alkanes including [123]tetramantane, hexadeuterated neopentane, and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;perhydroazulene. Lastly, microscopic techniques and the crystalline sponge method are discussed as particularly promising approaches to revolutionize the field of stereochemical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Site&#8208;Specific N2&#8208;dG DNA Adducts: Formation, Synthesis, and TLS Polymerase&#8208;Mediated Bypass</title>
      <dc:description>
  Damages in DNA are a constant threat to the genome. Especially, N2&#8208;dG DNA adducts can have strong implications on the biological processes. A reliable and rapid access to various N2&#8208;dG modified oligonucleotides can be achieved. These modified DNAs can help in understanding the TLS polymerase&#8208;mediated accurate tolerance for maintaining genomic stability.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The N2&#8208;position of deoxyguanosine (dG) in DNA is susceptible to modification by various damaging agents. These modifications (lesions or adducts) can stall the DNA replication by replicative polymerases, and if the common DNA repair pathways do not remove them, it can result in genomic instability. This generally leads to the death or oncogenic transformation of the cell. An important mechanism to deal with this problem is Translesion synthesis (TLS), a bypass mechanism, which involves the tolerance of DNA damage by low&#8208;fidelity DNA polymerases (TLS polymerases). To understand the accuracy of TLS polymerases, a chemical biology approach is required. In this review, we discuss the reliable methods to synthesize specific N2&#8208;dG DNA adducts and how they are tolerated by bacterial TLS polymerase Pol IV and its mammalian orthologue hpol &#954;. Molecular insights on the accurate bypass of these adducts emerge from the primer extension assays, X&#8208;ray crystallographic, and molecular modeling studies are reviewed here.

      <title>Facile Synthetic Route to [3.n]Thiacyclophanes through Ring&#8208;Closing Metathesis and their Structural Studies</title>
      <dc:description>
  Here, we are reporting a simple synthetic strategy for the synthesis of thiacyclophanes by using the Grignard reaction and ring&#8208;closing metathesis as key steps. The structures are confirmed by single&#8208;crystal XRD diffraction studies and compared with computationally optimized structures.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  We report a useful synthetic strategy to assemble constrained [3.n] thiacyclophanes using Grignard reaction and Ti(OiPr)4 assisted ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM). This method is viable to access para, metapara, and meta isomers of thiacyclophanes. The structures of thiacyclophanes were confirmed unambiguously by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies and compared with computationally optimized structures. It is implied that out of four methods (ab initio and DFT), MP2/6&#8208;31G (d,p) is reasonably a better method for predicting structural parameters for this class of thiacyclophanes.
