         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H Arylation of Aryl Glycinamide Derivatives Using Picolinamide as Directing Group</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient protocol to access a set of arylated glycinamide derivatives through a C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H activation assisted by the directing group picolinamide and Pd(OAc)2 has been developed. The methodology has a high atom economy and broad substrate scope.







Abstract
A Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H bond arylation protocol has been developed to access ortho&#8208;diaryl, ortho&#8208;mono&#8208;aryl, and biaryl&#8208;diarylmethane&#8208;glycinamide derivatives bearing picolinamide as directing group. Mechanistic details of the process have been obtained by computational modelling of the activation reaction through DFT calculations.

         <title>Divergent Annulation of Spiro[indoline&#8208;pyran] and Fused (Epoxyetheno)indeno&#8208;Furan from 1,2&#8208;Diketone and 1&#8208;Cyanoketone</title>

         <dc:description>
A operationally simple one&#8208;step method developed for the spiro[indoline&#8208;pyran] and fused (epoxyetheno)indeno[1,2&#8208;b]furan derivatives from 1&#8208;cyanoketones and cyclic 1,2&#8208;diketon.







Abstract
A simple and efficient method for the construction of spiro[indoline&#8208;pyran] and fused (epoxyetheno)indeno[1,2&#8208;b]furan compounds from 1&#8208;cyanoketones and 1,2&#8208;diketone has been developed. The synthesis proceeded via the Knoevenagel and Michael adduct through intramolecular/Paal&#8208;Knorr cyclization under similar reaction condition. The less commonly used 1&#8208;cyanoketones and active carbonyl compounds served as the indole containing pyran and bicyclic furan source for the preparation of a new series of heterocyclic compounds. This heterocyclic structure allows one and more than one tetra&#8208;substituted carbon center and sequential hexa&#8208; and penta&#8208;cyclic core under very mild conditions and shows excellent chemo and regioselectivity. In addition, the synthesis of spiro[indoline&#8208;pyran] and (epoxyetheno)indeno[1,2&#8208;b]furan was demonstrated in a gram scale.

         <title>Boronic Acid&#8208;Mediated Photocatalysis Enables the Intramolecular Hydroacylation of Olefins Using Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intramolecular hydroacylation of olefins with carboxylic acids (CAs) has been developed, which is based on visible&#8208;light photoredox/boronic acid catalysis. The direct use of CAs as acyl&#8208;radical precursors was made possible with the aid of boronic acid, and CAs were easily converted into the corresponding cyclic ketones without the need for any stoichiometric activating reagents.







Abstract
An intramolecular hydroacylation of olefins using carboxylic acids (CAs) has been developed. With the aid of a boronic acid, CAs can be used as acyl&#8208;radical precursors in catalytic photoredox reactions driven by visible light. The CAs are easily converted into their corresponding cyclic ketones without the need to use any stoichiometric activating reagents. Mechanistic studies implied that the formation of an &#8220;ate&#8221; complex from the CA and boronic acid is crucial for the generation of the acyl radical equivalent from the unreactive carboxy group.

         <title>Structure activity studies of nitroreductase&#8208;responsive near&#8208;infrared heptamethine cyanine fluorescent probes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new classes of near&#8208;infrared molecular probes were prepared and shown to exhibit &#8220;turn on&#8221; fluorescence when cleaved by the nitroreductase enzyme, a well&#8208;known biomarker of cell hypoxia. The fluorescent probes are heptamethine cyanine dyes with a central 4&#8216;&#8208;carboxylic ester group on the heptamethine chain that is converted by a self&#8208;immolative fragmentation mechanism to a 4&#8216;&#8208;caboxylate group that greatly enhances the fluorescence brightness. Each compound was prepared by ring opening of a Zincke salt. The chemical structures have either terminal benzoindolinenes or propargyloxy auxochromes, which provide favorable red&#8208;shifted absorption/emission wavelengths and a hyperchromic effect that enhances the photon output when excited by 808 nm light. A fluorescent probe with terminal propargyloxy&#8208;indolenines exhibited less self&#8208;aggregation and was rapidly activated by nitrodeductase with large &#8220;turn on&#8220; fluorescence; thus, it is the preferrred choice for translation towards in vivo applications.</dc:description>

         <title>The structure of hemicalide from the marine sponge Hemimycale sp.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hemicalide is a marine natural product isolated from the sponge H  emimycale sp  ., collected near the Torres Islands of Vanuatu. It is characterized by cytotoxicity in the sub&#8208;nanomolar range, with an original mode of action. This article describes the establishment of the flat structure of hemicalide, based on extensive use of 2D&#8208;NMR experiments. The molecule belongs to the polyketide class with an irregular combination of acetates and propionates and adorned with two unusual hydroxylated six&#8208;membered ring lactones. After publication of the original patent, groups in Paris and Cambridge (UK) launched synthetic programmes with the aim of elucidating the configurations of some of the 21 stereogenic centres. The second part of the article discusses these achievements and presents the best hypothesis, to date, for hemicalide.</dc:description>

         <title>Origins of Organic Chemistry and Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origins of organic chemistry and organic synthesis started in the middle ages, long before molecular compositions were known. Paradigm shifts caused by Lavoisier, Chevreuil, W&#246;hler, Liebig, Kolbe and Berthelot are highlighted. The graphic shows some early key organic molecules, but although synthesis and analysis had become well established sciences by the 1840s, the chemical structures remained essentially unknown.







Abstract
The words organic and synthesis originate with Aristotle (meaning &#8216;instrumental&#8217; and &#8216;put together&#8217;, respectively) but had different meanings over time. The iatrochemists prepared numerous pharmaceutical remedies in the 1600s but had no concept of organic chemistry. Buffon, Bergman and Gren defined organic bodies as living things in the 1700s, but discrete organic compounds remained unknown. In the late 1700s and early 1800s, organic natural products were isolated by Scheele, and Chevreuil separated carboxylic acids from saponification of fats. Organic chemistry had started. Lavoisier invented and Berzelius improved combustion analysis for organic characterization. Descartes&#8217; dictum that synthesis is required to prove an analysis was enacted by Bergman and others. The concept of organic chemistry changed radically when W&#246;hler and Kolbe prepared organic compounds from the elements. Berthelot's syntheses of non&#8208;natural fats in 1853 started modern synthetic organic chemistry as the chemistry of carbon compounds, regardless of whether occurring in Nature or not.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent C&#8722;H Arylations of Aryl&#8208;Substituted Azoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 12, March 29, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over the past decades, several examples of regiodivergent arylations of aryl&#8208;substituted azoles have been described. The nature of the metal catalyst was found to be the key factor to control the regioselectivity. In this review, we summarize the current procedures allowing to perform such regiodivergent arylations.







Abstract
The metal&#8208;catalyzed direct functionalization of two different C&#8722;H bonds of the same organic molecule &#8211; also called regiodivergent C&#8722;H bond functionalization &#8211; is an important research topic in organic chemistry. Over the last decades, the number of tools to control such regiodivergent C&#8722;H bond functionalizations has increased significantly. One of the most effective tools consists of employing different metal sources as the catalysts. Palladium and copper catalysts are very effective to promote the direct arylation of 5&#8208;membered ring heteroarenes, whereas the direct arylation using ruthenium and rhodium catalysts generally relies on the coordination of heteroelements to the metal. Therefore, in the presence of several aryl&#8208;substituted azoles, the arylation of both the aryl unit using Ru&#8208; or Rh&#8208;catalysis and of the azole unit using Pd&#8208; or Cu&#8208;catalysts is possible. In this review, we will describe the scope and current limits of the use of this tool for the regiodivergent direct arylation of aryl&#8208;substituted azoles.

         <title>Synthesis of Disilanes, Dihydrosiloles, and 1,4&#8208;Disilacyclohexa&#8208;2,5&#8208;dienes by Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Transfer of Diphenylsilylene and Dimethylsilylene from Silylboronic Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 12, March 29, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transfer of diphenylsilylene (Ph2Si:) and dimethylsilylene (Me2Si:) from silylboronic esters takes place at 110&#8211;135&#8201;&#176;C under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. The reaction with alkoxysilanes, 1,3&#8208;dienes, and an alkyne affords alkoxydisilanes, dihydrosiloles, and 1,4&#8208;disilacyclohexa&#8208;2,5&#8208;dienes, respectively, in good to high yields.







Abstract
We found that the transfer of diphenylsilylene (Ph2Si:) from Ph2(Et2N)Si&#8722;B(pin) (1&#8201;a) takes place in toluene or p&#8208;xylene at 110&#8211;135&#8201;&#176;C under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. The reaction of alkoxysilanes with 1&#8201;a affords alkoxydisilanes through the insertion of diphenylsilylene into the Si&#8722;O bond. Dihydrosiloles and a 1,4&#8208;disilacyclohexa&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene are synthesized by the reaction of 1&#8201;a with 1,3&#8208;dienes and an alkyne, respectively, through cycloaddition of the carbon&#8208;carbon unsaturated bonds with diphenylsilylene. Me2(Et2N)Si&#8722;B(pin) (10) is applicable to the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free transfer of dimethylsilylene (Me2Si:).

The ligand makes the difference: A new chiral phosphoramidite ligand allows to perform the Ir&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;allylation of amino acid esters with unsurpassed stereoselectivity employing readily accessible branched (racemic) allyl carbonates.







Abstract
The investigation of the iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric N&#8208;allylation of tert&#8208;butyl glycinate using a &#8220;branched&#8221; racemic 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;alkyl methyl carbonate revealed severe limitations of existing protocols. By screening a set of 24 BINOL&#8208;derived chiral phosphoramidites a new superior ligand (L24*) was identified which afforded the amination product with high enantioselectivity (&#8805;95&#8201;%&#8197;ee) under optimized conditions. This ligand also allowed the N&#8208;allylation of other amino acid tert&#8208;butyl esters (derived from alanine, phenylalanine, or proline) with outstanding levels of diastereocontrol (d.r. &#8805;99&#8201;:&#8201;1) and negligible matched/mismatched differences.

         <title>Manufacturing Approaches of New Halogenated Agrochemicals</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 12, March 29, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of the latest generation of halogen&#8208;containing agrochemicals introduced into the market over the past 10&#8197;years is provided. Manufacturing approaches of current halogen&#8208;containing development candidates are described.







Abstract
To ensure sustainability, the agrochemical industry is faced with enormous challenges, from provision of high&#8208;quality food to water use, environmental impact and growing world population. The loss of agrochemicals due to consumer perception, changing grower needs and everchanging regulatory requirements is higher than the number of active ingredients being introduced into the market. Therefore, the development of new agrochemicals is essential, that can provide improved efficacy and favorable environmental profiles. In this context, introduction of halogen atoms into a molecule is an important tool to influence its physico&#8208;chemical properties. Since 2010, around 81&#8201;% of the launched agrochemicals contain halogen atoms. This Review gives an overview of the latest generation of halogen&#8208;containing agrochemicals introduced into the market over the past 10&#8197;years and describes manufacturing approaches of current halogen&#8208;containing development candidates.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Aminoacrylonitriles from 1,2,3&#8208;Triazine and Secondary Amines</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient approach for the stereoselective synthesis of (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aminoacrylonitriles from 1,2,3&#8208;triazine is presented. The reactions employ Cu(OAc)2 to promote direct 1,2,3&#8208;triazine coupling with various secondary amines and subsequent aerobic oxidation without the participation of ligand, base or chemical oxidant additives. This user&#8208;friendly protocol has merits of substrate availability, easy operation and good yields of the products with excellent (E)&#8208; stereoselectivities.







Abstract
We describe a simple protocol for the synthesis of (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aminoacrylonitriles via Cu(OAc)2&#8208;mediated nucleophilic addition of secondary amines to 1,2,3&#8208;triazine 1 and an aerobic oxidation reaction. The reactions, which were studied with a broad substrate scope, are effective with cyclic, heterocyclic, aliphatic, allylic, and benzylic amines as well as l&#8208;proline derivatives. The reactions use catalytic Cu(OAc)2 to promote 1,2,3&#8208;triazine addition with various secondary amines, followed by in&#8197;situ loss of nitrogen and subsequent imine oxidation to generate the corresponding (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aminoacrylonitriles in good yields with excellent stereoselectivities. These copper(II)&#8208;mediated aerobic oxidation reactions proceed under mild reaction conditions by oxidation of the Cu(II) species using molecular oxygen to complete the cycle without the participation of ligand, base or chemical oxidant additives.

         <title>Molecular targets of neurotoxic insecticides in Apis mellifera</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intensive use of insecticides, combined with other factors such as habitat loss, might explain worldwide decrease of insect populations documented in the past twenty years. However, due to the involvement of pest species in crop destruction and in vector&#8208;borne diseases, insecticides will probably continue to be required still for decades. The most commercially successful insecticides are neurotoxicants acting on ion channels of the central nervous system affecting thereby cellular excitability and synaptic transmission, and causing insect paralysis and fatality. In this article, we provide an overview of the insecticides acting on voltage&#8208;gated sodium channels, GABA&#8208;gated chloride channels and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. We summarize the current knowledge on those ion channels from the honeybee  Apis mellifera  and discuss the possible mode of action of neurotoxic insecticides.</dc:description>

Abstract
An efficient protocol for the synthesis of poly&#8208;functionalized 1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;4H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;b]isoquinolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones is described. First, propargyl&#8208;containing Ugi adducts were transformed to polysubstituted dihydroisoquinolines by an intramolecular Au&#8208;catalyzed alkyne hydro&#8208;arylation, followed by the alkene isomerization process. Then, these pivotal intermediates were engaged in a xanthate&#8208;based oxidative radical cascade addition/cyclization process with a suitable alkene.

The Front Cover shows Diana's Temple (an ancient roman temple enclosure) from the city of Evora, Portugal. The ancient ouroboros symbolism is synonymous with rebirth and renewal, and stands for the conception of aromatic ring systems in organic chemistry. Several methods that afford such ring systems as the central platform of medicinal compounds are discussed in this review: especially medicinally relevant oxygen benzofused heterocycles by palladium and copper catalyzed C&#8722;X activation of halo arenes.

The protocol can be applied to both the free base and hydrochloride salts of the amines and produces water as the only by&#8208;product. This transformation can provide easy access to chiral N&#8208;alkyl amines from readily available starting materials in a simple one step reaction.

     alt="N-Alkylation of &#945;-Amino Esters and Amides through Hydrogen Borrowing"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A method for the iridium catalysed direct alkylation of amino esters and amides using alcohols, which can utilise both the free base and HCl salts of the amine, was developed. This reaction proceeds through a borrowing hydrogen borrowing mechanism.

         <title>Versatile and highly efficient trans&#8208;[Pd(NHC)Cl2(DMS/THT)] precatalysts for C&#8208;C and C&#8208;N coupling reactions in green solvents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A straightforward synthetic procedure to well&#8208;defined, air&#8208; and moisture&#8208; stable trans&#8208;[Pd(NHC)Cl  2  (DMS/THT)] (NHC = IPr, SIPr, IMes, IPr  Cl  , IPr*, IPr  #  ) pre&#8208;catalysts is reported. These complexes were obtained by reacting&#160;  NHC&#183;HCl imidazolium salts with trans&#8208;[PdCl  2  (DMS/THT)  2  ] precursors with the assistance of the weak base K  2  CO  3  &#160;in green acetone at 40&#160;  &#176;C  . The scalability of this protocol was demonstrated. The catalytic activity of the synthesized complexes was studied in the Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig and Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions. Remarkably, most of the synthesized complexes exhibit higher catalytic activity with respect to their PEPPSI congeners in the Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination in 2&#8208;MeTHF. In particular, complex trans&#8208;[Pd(IPr  #  )Cl  2  (DMS)] enabled the coupling of various (hetero)aryl chlorides and primary/secondary amines with a 0.2 mol% catalyst loading. In addition, trans&#8208;  [Pd(IPr)Cl  2  (DMS)  ] showed excellent performance in the room&#8208;temperature Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction involving various (hetero)aryl chlorides and aryl boronic acids. In summary, the synthesized complexes, especially trans&#8208;[Pd(NHC)Cl  2  (DMS)], can be considered as greener alternatives to classical PEPPSI type catalysts based on the lower toxicity of the throw&#8208;away DMS ligand compared to&#160; 3&#8208;chloropyridine.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A straightforward copper&#8208;catalyzed aerobic cyclocondensation reaction of &#945;&#8211;acyl ketene dithioacetals with ammonium acetate and methanol was developed for synthesizing highly functionalized pyrimidines. This domino conversion relied on the dual activities of CuCl  2  , namely Lewis acid and dehydrogenation, which began with single C&#8722;S ammonolysis directed by an&#160;  in situ  &#160;generated imine, followed by cyclocondensation with aldehyde produced from alcohol and concomitant oxidative dehydrogenation under an oxygen atmosphere. Notably, readily accessible and flexible substrates, common chemical feedstock nitrogen and C1 sources, good functional group tolerance and procedural simplicity exhibit the efficiency and potential application of the new method.</dc:description>

         <title>Samarium(II)&#8208;Promoted Cyclizations of Non&#8208;activated Indolyl Sulfinyl Imines to Polycyclic Tertiary Carbinamines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Samarium(II)&#8208;promoted cyclizations of N &#8208;acylated indolyl sulfinyl imines without electron&#8208;withdrawing groups at C&#8208;3 furnished tertiary carbinamines in good yield. Screening of the reaction conditions revealed that application of an excess of samarium diiodide in the presence of water and lithium bromide provided the cleanest reactions and the highest yields. The most striking observation during this investigation was the reductive detachment of the sulfur functional group, which most likely precedes the cyclization step. As consequence no enantioselectivity could be observed if enantiopure sulfinyl imines were employed. The mechanisms of the N&#8208;S cleavage and of the cyclization of the intermediate imines as well as the role of the additives are discussed. The presented method generates interesting polycyclic indoline derivatives; a cascade reaction involving an ethoxycarbonyl&#8208;substituted side&#8208;chain provided unique tetracyclic spiro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and aggregation behavior of novel linear and branched oligothiophene&#8208;containing organosilicon multipods</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of novel oligothiophene&#8208;containing carbosilane&#8208;siloxanes of linear or branched structure with conjugation lengths of 4&#8208;7 thiophene rings, flexible aliphatic spacers varying from &#1057;  3  to &#1057;  11  , and various degrees of branching of end&#8208;capping solubilizing groups is reported. The investigation of their phase behavior by differential scanning calorimetry and polarizing optical microscopy showed that although some of them can form liquid&#8208;crystalline phases, the majority of the linear molecules exhibits a high degree of crystallinity, which decreases with increasing degree of branching. Aggregation studies in dilute solutions in toluene at different temperatures allowed determination of the temperature and concentration dependence of their dissociation. The investigation of thin films prepared from dilute solutions revealed the formation of fibril domains confirming aggregation of the molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and SAR of 2,3&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;benzofuran&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylates: Potent Salicylic Acid&#8208;Based Lead Structures against Plant Stress</title>

         <dc:description>
In the agrochemical in&#8197;vivo SAR&#8208;study described in this work, it is outlined how a lead structure that had emerged from rational design inspired by natural products from liverworts and hydrangea has been identified, explored and optimized. In the course of the in&#8208;depth SAR study, several new potent 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;benzofuran&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylates have been identified that show improved in&#8197;vivo efficacy against drought and cold stress in broad&#8208;acre crops such as corn, wheat and canola compared with the initial lead structure.







Abstract
New 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;benzofuran&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid derivatives have been identified as potent lead structures against drought and cold stress in crops starting from the synthetic exploration of stabilized analogs of the natural product lunularic acid. An optimized Lewis&#8208;acid mediated cyclization gave a short and efficient access to the envisaged 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;benzofuran&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylates. Enantioselective approaches were investigated to assess the potential impact of the chiral center on in&#8197;vivo activity. Whilst 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;benzofuran&#8208;4&#8208;carboxamides and 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;benzofuran&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylates carrying phenyl substituents with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups exhibited only low to moderate in&#8197;vivo activity, the corresponding 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;benzofuran&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylates carrying optimized electron&#8208;donating substituents in the phenyl moiety revealed strong in&#8197;vivo activity, both against drought stress in several broad&#8208;acre crops, as well as against cold stress in corn. Remarkably, several 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;benzofuran&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylates showed stronger efficacy than the internal standards used in our in&#8197;vivo SAR study.

         <dc:description>A new approach to the synthesis of isoindolinones via the direct coupling of N  &#8208;methoxybenzamides and bis(tosylamido)methane with rhodium(III) as catalyst has been developed. The reaction is performed under mild conditions, without oxidant, and is compatible with various functional groups. Compared with the previously reported method for constructing isoindolinone skeletons, this method involves a novel [3+2] cyclization, and affords a wide variety of isoindolinones in moderate to excellent yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Aerobic Oxidation of Hydrazines into 2&#8208;Tetrazenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the catalytic formation of 2&#8208;tetrazenes by copper&#160;(ii) promoted oxidation of hydrazines in the presence of bipyridine ligands, that uses air or dioxygen as terminal oxidant. The method was applied to a series of hydrazines, delivering symmetrical tetrazenes, which were previously prepared using toxic or stoichiometric oxidants. The catalytic reaction could be used for the formation of a cyclic tetrazene from a bis&#8208;hydrazine, presumably with the help of a chelation of the substrate to the catalytic metal, which favored cyclization over oligomerization. Finally, the method could be used to prepare dissymmetric structures, albeit in the presence of an excess of one of the hydrazines.</dc:description>

         <title>Smart Photochromic Materials Triggered with Visible Light</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Review, various classes of molecular photoswitches triggered with visible light are reported together with their applications in phototriggered smart materials &#8211; polymers, hydrogels, surfaces, porous materials, and sunlight energy storage materials. Advantages of such systems over classical UV&#8208;light triggered photochromic materials, the scope of their applicability, and their limitations are discussed.







Abstract
Molecular photoswitches reversibly convert the energy of light into a variety of structural changes at the molecular level. They can be integrated into smart materials with broad range of applicability. While most photochromic systems require UV light for activation, application of photoswitches operational entirely within the visible or NIR range of light brings considerable benefits, such as biocompatibility, better light penetration through the material, propelling with sunlight, or a possibility to design dual systems that are mutually activated with UV or visible light frequencies for two distinct functions. In this Review, we discuss the most relevant classes of molecular photoswitches, and demonstrate a selection of photochromic polymers, gels, porous materials, surfaces, energy&#8208;storing materials and other systems triggered with visible light.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conjugated macrocyclic nanoring, cyclo[9]paraphenylene&#8208;2,11&#8208;hexabenzocoronenylene ([9]CPPH2,11) with graphenic hexabenzocoronene sidewall was facilely synthesized. The structure of [9]CPPH2,11 was confirmed by different techniques. Its photophysical properties and potential applications in hole&#8208; and electron&#8208; transport devices were further studied.







Abstract
Herein, we report a facile synthesis of a conjugated macrocyclic nanoring, cyclo[9]paraphenylene&#8208;2,11&#8208;hexabenzocoronenylene ([9]CPPH2,11) with graphenic hexabenzocoronene sidewall by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The structure of [9]CPPH2,11 was confirmed by HR&#8208;MS and NMR. The photophysical properties were studied using UV/Vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Possessing unique structural and physical properties, this conjugated macrocyclic nanoring with a graphenic hexabenzocoronene sidewall can expand the scope of bottom&#8208;up synthesis of uniform carbon nanotube segments and potential applications in hole&#8208; and electron&#8208; transport devices.

         <title>Comparing Halogen Atom Abstraction Kinetics for Mn(I), Fe(I), Co(I), and Ni(I) Complexes by Combining Electroanalytical and Statistical Modeling</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>First&#8208;row transition metal complexes have garnered attention due to their ability to activate aliphatic halides for catalytic cross&#8208;coupling reactions. However, mechanistic investigation of these systems is challenging as a consequence of difficulties associated with preparing the relevant metal complexes and the resultant poor stability of such intermediates for subsequent analytical interrogation. In this context, we have developed a platform to rapidly measure kinetic data using electroanalytical methods, which facilitates a wide range of physical organic studies. As a result, we have investigated and compared the reaction of benzyllic halides with electrogenerated MnI(PyBox)Cl, FeI(Pyrox)OTf, CoI(Pyrox)Br, CoI(PyBox)Br, NiI(Phox)Br complexes. The experimental results support a unified inner&#8208;sphere halogen atom abstraction mechanism for these different complexes while also providing the ability to directly compare through multivariate linear regression analyses the subtle differences imparted by metal/ligand combinations. The information gleaned by this study has implications why certain metal complexes are matched to oxidative addition processes relevant in catalytic processes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The palladium&#8208;catalyzed desulfitative coupling of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones with arylsulfonyl chlorides is described.

         <title>Formation and Chemical and Optical Properties of 1,2,5&#8208;Triphenylpentadienyl Cation Fixed in a Rigid Dibenzobarrelene Skeleton</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,2,5&#8208;Triphenylpentadienyl cation fused with a dibenzobarrelene skeleton was generated by the treatment of the corresponding 1&#8208;OH precursor with B  3  &#8226;Et  2  O, HBF  4  in Et  2  O, aq. HBF  4  , or aq. HClO  4  in dichloromethane or chloroform&#8208;  d  . The pentadienyl cation was persistent in solution and characterized by  1  H and  13  C NMR spectroscopies. The cation abstracts a hydride from Et  2  O at the 5&#8208;position to give the 5&#8208;H derivative together with acetaldehyde and ethene. The reaction with H  2  O provided the 5&#8208;OH derivative and not the 1&#8208;OH precursor. The hydride reduction of the pentadienyl cation with silanes or NaBH  4  occurred at the 3&#8208; and 5positions, and the ratio was dependent on the bulkiness of reducing reagents. The cation in dichloromethane exhibited long&#8208;wavelength absorptions at 678, 523, and 443 nm and an emission maximum at 729 nm with the emission quantum yield of 0.175, which are longer and larger than those of the referenced 1,5&#8208;diphenylpentadienyl cation. TD&#8208;DFT calculations show that the absorptions are due to the &#960;&#8211;&#960;* excitations on 1,2,5&#8208;triphenylpentadienyl and dibenzobarrelene benzene rings.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a generally applicable method for the preparation of N&#8208;substituted benzo[4,5]thiazolo[2,3&#8208;c][1,2,4]triazol&#8208;1&#8208;ium salts from air stable precursors. This transformation is carried out via the selective deprotection of a para&#8208;methoxybenzyl protected thiol followed by C&#8211;H functionalization of the linked 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salts under oxidative conditions, thereby forming the fused aromatic heterocycle. Using this procedure, we are able to synthesize a variety of tricyclic thiazolium salts which contain both electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating aromatic substituents as well as aliphatic substituents. Our approach has proven to be tolerant towards many functional groups including alkynes, alcohols, diols, amides, and polyethers.</dc:description>

Reduction and esterification of these hydroxy methylene groups, bromination of the double bond, removal of bromine to form the new double bond, and replacement of the remaining bromines by the Suzuki coupling reaction with phenyl groups were carried out. After cleaving the oxo&#8208;bridge in the related compounds and hydrolysis of the ester groups, new phenyl substitutedcyclopolyol and cyclohalopolyol carbasugar derivatives were obtained. The structures of target compounds were defined using different chemical methods, such as chromatography, NMR, IR, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The  in vitro  inhibitory activities of final compounds were tested against  &#945;  &#8208;,  &#946;  &#8208; glucosidase enzymes.

         <title>Quinazolinone Alkaloid Febrifugine and its Analogues to Control Phytopathogenic Diseases Caused by Oomycete Fungi</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling phytopathogenic diseases caused by oomycete fungi is still a challenge in crop protection research. Studies on identifying new starting points to control phytopathogens revealed that the quinazolinone alkaloids Febrifugine (  1  ) and Halofuginone (  2  ) are efficiently inhibiting the growth of  Phytophthora infestans  in microtiter tests. However, despite the very good  in vitro  activity of 0.13 and 0.06 ppm in IC  50  , respectively, both compounds did not exhibit a good control of  P. infestans  on tomato plants. Creating a homology model of prolyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase &#8211; the molecular target of Halofuginone &#8211; helped to understand the interactions between  2  and the binding pocket and guided the synthesis of further derivatives. Ultimately, we found that deoxy&#8208;Febrifugine (  14  ) and Halofuginol (  17  ) and its derivatives were able to control  P. infestans  also on the plant.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;Mediated Remote Deuteration of N&#8208;Heteroarenes &#8211; Broad Scope and Mechanism</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deuterated organic molecules provide the basis for many applications in life sciences and material research. Thus, methodologies to access labeled compounds with defined selectivity continue to be important. Using KOtBu as base and DMSO&#8208;d6 as deuterium source, we present a general and applicable method for the selective deuteration of a set of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles (pyridines, azines and bioactive molecules). Experimental and DFT mechanistic studies indicate that this reaction proceeds via deprotonation of the substrates by the dimsyl anion. The relative thermodynamic stability of the heterocycle anions determines the distribution and degree of deuteration.</dc:description>

         <title>The Perkin Strategy for the synthesis of large carboxy&#8208;substituted polycyclic aromatic compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and versatile synthetic approach has been developed for the synthesis of large carboxy&#8208;substituted polycyclic arenes. This strategy relies on Perkin reactions between arylacetic and arylglyoxylic acids for the formation of flexible precursors. A subsequent rigidification step, by catalyst&#8208; or light&#8208;induced intramolecular cyclization reactions, then yealds fully condensed polycyclic aromatic compounds. Protection and deprotection techniques have been developed to allow the controlled assembly of a large number of building blocks. This method can now be applied to the formation of planar or non&#8208;planar, linear or macrocyclic species of various sizes.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;containing sp&#179;&#8208;Enriched Building Blocks for the Multigram Synthesis of Fluorinated Pyrazoles and Pyrimidines with (Hetero)aliphatic Substituents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient approaches to the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of fluorinated pyrazoles and pyrimidines bearing saturated (hetero)cyclic substituents are described. The methods rely on the heterocyclizations of sp&#179;&#8208;enriched &#946;&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroketones and fluorinated enaminones (in turn prepared from saturated heterocyclic &#945;&#8208;fluoroketones), respectively; these compounds themselves are useful synthetic intermediates that have been prepared on multigram scale for the first time. LogP and aqueous solubility measurements, as well as lead&#8208;likeness assessment using the Nelson&#8217;s LLAMA tool show that the 19 synthesized sp&#179;&#8208;enriched fluorinated building blocks meet the lead&#8208;oriented synthesis criteria.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Syntheses of Deuterated Pipecolic Acids as Tools to Investigate the Stereoselectivity of the Hydroxylase GetF</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Members of the GE81112 family are interesting candidates for the development of antibiotics. The configuration of the OH&#8208;group on the pipecolic acid moiety plays a pivotal role in antibiotic activity. To investigate the stereoselectivity of the corresponding hydroxylase GetF, involved in the biosynthetic pathway, we synthesized the two deuterium&#8208;labeled pipecolic acid diastereomers in a highly stereoselective fashion via chelate&#8208;enolate Claisen rearrangement. The stereochemical outcome of the enzymatic hydroxylation step could easily be determined by analysis of mass differences between the products.</dc:description>

         <title>Oligonucleotide Conjugation by Tyrosine&#8208;Click Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tyrosine&#8208;click reaction was established for the conjugation of oligonucleotides exhibiting a tyrosine moiety and using phenyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;dione as a model. The reaction can be applied in solution or on solid support.







Abstract
N,O&#8208;Diacetyl tyrosine and 3&#8208;(4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;phenyl)&#8208;propanoic acid were converted into phosphoramidite derivatives and introduced to the 5&#8242;&#8208;end of oligonucleotides. The resulting oligonucleotides exhibiting a 4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl alkyl group were conjugated with 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;dione as a model of a Y&#8208;click reaction. The reaction is fast (&lt;1&#8197;h) and efficient (&gt;90&#8201;%). A partial side reaction occurred at the C8 position of deoxyguanosine in single&#8208;stranded oligonucleotides. This side reaction does not take place on the G quadruplex and double&#8208;stranded oligonucleotides and when N2 position of guanine is protected. This Y&#8208;click reaction could be applied to 1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;dione derivatives displaying a fluorescent dye, a carbohydrate or orthogonal functions (alkyne, azide, ketone or maleimide) for the labelling of oligonucleotides.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of 4&#8208;Alkynylquinazolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract.  Protocols have been developed that allow easy access to 4&#8208;alkynylquinazolines under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. The ring opening reaction of 4&#8208;(benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)quinazolines obtained from the arylation of quinazolines with benzofuran is the first way to achieve 4&#8208;alkynylquinazolines. Direct alkynylation of quinazolines with terminal alkynes in the presence of  n  &#8208;BuLi and iodine or with alkynyl Grignard reagents is another strategy. Desilylation of 4&#8208;((trimethylsilyl)ethynyl)quinazolines obtained by direct alkynation is the third approach to give 4&#8208;alkynylquinazolines. It has also been shown that the protocols are applicable for scale&#8208;up synthesis.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical hydroxylation of arenes by trifluoroacetic acid provides a straightforward access to aryl oxygen compounds under the mild and environmental benign reaction conditions. Harmful and pollutant stoichiometric amounts of oxidation reagents and the use of metal&#8208;catalysts can be avoided. Herein, we present a novel method for the synthesis of hydroxylated products from electron&#8208;rich arenes that was achieved by the implementation of a continuous&#8208;flow setup. The continuous nature of the process allowed to fine&#8208;tune the reactions conditions in order to prevent the decomposition of the sensitive products expanding the reaction scope beyond electron&#8208;poor and neutral arenes that were previously reported in the batch processes. Thus, synthetically valuable hydroxylated arenes were obtained in good yields with the residence time just over a minute. In order to demonstrate the reliability and the efficiency of the electrochemical flow setup, a scale up experiment was also performed.</dc:description>

         <title>Crown&#8208;Ether&#8208;Based Cryptands with Rarely Strong Affinities for Binding Neutral Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8242;iterative approach&#8242; of delicately tunning the non&#8208;covalent interactions could be a powerful route to construct molecular hosts that exhibit high selectivity and affinity for guest molecules. Through tailoring spatial fitting and multi non&#8208;covalent interactions (especially H&#8208;bonding), cryptands with rarely strong affinities for binding neutral guest molecules were achieved.







Abstract
Herein, we present the syntheses of two new crown&#8208;ether&#8208;based cryptands and their complexation behaviors with neutral organic molecules. The interactions between 4/5 and G1/G2 were fast exchange systems forming pseudorotaxane&#8208;like complexes with a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometric ratio. The association constant (Ka) of &#8220;long&#8208;armed&#8221; cryptand 5 with G2 was even up to 2.5&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1, which is 10 to 103&#8197;times higher than the previously reported host&#8208;neutral guest system to the best of our knowledge. Such a large Ka is even comparable to that of reported cryptands with secondary ammonium salts and paraquat derivatives. Thorough studies demonstrated that excellent spatial fitting and multi non&#8208;covalent interactions (H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking) are essential for such a large Ka.

Herein, we report a concise approach of 6,6&#8208;disubstituted 6H&#8208;benzo[c]chromenes in a two&#8208;step sequence starting from ortho&#8208;bromo benzylic alcohols and arylboronic acids, using intermolecular palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C and intramolecular N&#8208;Iodosuccinimide (NIS) mediated key C&#8722;O bonds construction.







Abstract
Benzo[c]chromones are valuable tricyclic systems of natural and biological significance. Herein, we report a concise approach of 6,6&#8208;disubstituted 6H&#8208;benzo[c]chromenes in a two&#8208;step sequence starting from ortho&#8208;bromo benzylic alcohols and arylboronic acids, using intermolecular palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C and intramolecular N&#8208;Iodosuccinimide (NIS) mediated key C&#8722;O bonds construction. Besides, the current method explored broad substrate scope under robust conditions. Notably, the practicality of the present approach is further extended for the total synthesis of Didehydroconicol.

         <title>Annelated Pyridine Bases for the Selective Acylation of 1,2&#8208;Diols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acylation of primary over secondary hydroxyl groups in 1,2&#8208;ethanediols depends strongly on size effects and noncovalent interactions between the alcohol side chains and the catalysts surface.







Abstract
A set of 24 annelated derivatives of 4&#8208;diaminopyridine (DMAP) has been synthesized and tested with respect to its catalytic potential in the regioselective acylation of 1,2&#8208;diol substrates. The Lewis basicities of the catalysts as quantified through quantum chemical calculations vary due to inductive substituent effects and intramolecular stacking interactions between side chain &#960;&#8208;systems and the pyridinium core ring system. The primary over secondary hydroxyl group selectivities in catalytic acylations of 1,2&#8208;diol substrates depend on the size and the steric demand of the Lewis base and the anhydride reagent.

This study describes the synthesis of a heterotriptycene consisting of an unsubstituted bispyrrole from a novel Diels&#8208;Alder reaction active benzobicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. The resulting molecule formed a 2D&#8208;hexagonal array in crystalline state.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis, crystal structure, and optical properties of a heterotriptycene consisting of an unsubstituted bispyrrole, 2,4,6,8&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;4,8&#8208;benzobenzo[1,2&#8208;c:4,5&#8208;c&#8242;]dipyrrole, which was synthesized via hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of a novel benzobicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. The compound formed a 2D nested hexagonal array with NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions in the crystalline state; whereas, in the solution state, it exhibited through&#8208;space intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) induced emission in the solution state.

         <title>Study of [2]&#8208; and [3]Rotaxanes Obtained by Post&#8208;Synthetic Aminolysis of a Kinetically Stable Carbonate&#8208;Containing Pseudorotaxane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article describes the straightforward access to a stable though activated carbonate&#8208;containing pseudorotaxane building block and its respective post&#8208;synthetic conversions into either [2]rotaxane and palindromic [3]rotaxane.







Abstract
Here is reported the synthesis and study of dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8)&#8208;based [2]&#8208; and [3]rotaxanes that contain an ammonium as the best molecular station and carbamate moieties as secondary molecular stations. The common post&#8208;interlocking synthesis relies on the aminolysis of the N&#8208;succinimidyl carbonate extremity of an activated though insulated pseudorotaxane. The N&#8208;succinimidyl carbonate&#8208;based thread's extremity proved to be small enough to allow the slow slippage of the DB24C8 around the thread and large enough to allow insulation of the kinetically stable pseudorotaxane. Due to its sensitivity towards amine compounds, the activated carbonate end of the encircled thread allowed post&#8208;interlocking aminolysis&#8208;based conversion into mechanically interlocked rotaxanes by providing the same way the carbamate secondary station for the DB24C8 in the thread backbone. Translation of the DB24C8 along the threaded axle between the two molecular stations was investigated.

         <title>Preorganized Homochiral Pyrrole&#8208;Based Receptors that Display Enantioselective Anion Binding</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a series of tris(pyrrolamide) receptors for anion recognition is presented. The receptors were able to bind to a variety of anions with good affinity, and homochiral receptors produced a 1.6&#8208;fold greater affinity for (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;mandelate over (R)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;mandelate, demonstrating the ability to differentiate between these enantiomeric anions.







Abstract
Herein, a new scaffold for anion recognition based on a tripodal tris(pyrrolamide) motif is presented. The receptors were able to bind to a variety of anions with high affinity. Using density functional theory methods, the three&#8208;dimensional geometry of the receptor&#8208;anion complex was calculated. These calculations show that the receptors bind anions via a preorganized cavity of amide and pyrrole hydrogen bond donor groups. Based on these findings, homochiral tris(pyrrolamide) receptors were prepared, which produced 1.6&#8208;fold greater affinity for (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;mandelate over (R)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;mandelate, demonstrating the ability to differentiate between these enantiomeric anions. The interaction of (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;mandelate and (R)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;mandelate within the homochiral receptor was examined by solution NMR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. These findings indicate that the preorganized positioning of the pyrrole groups and subsequent sterics allows to differentiate between the stereoisomeric anions.

         <title>SnCl2&#8208;catalyzed acetalation/selective&#8208;benzoylation sequence for the synthesis of orthogonally protected glycosyl acceptors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on SnCl 2 &#8208;catalyzed acetalation and selective benzoylation, a one&#8208;pot strategy to efficiently synthesize orthogonally protected glycosyl acceptors with a 2&#8208;OH/3&#8208;OH was developed. Consequently, 2&#8208;OBz or 3&#8208;OBz 4,6&#8208; O &#8208;benzylidene galactosides and glucosides were efficiently prepared in moderate to high yields starting from free galactosides and glucosides, and were used as valuable glycosyl acceptors for the synthesis of blood group antigens O and B analogues in this study.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Scope of Pnictogen&#8208;Assisted Cyclophane Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclophanes are a fundamentally interesting class of compounds that host a wide range of unique and emergent properties. However, synthesis of complex and/or functionalized cyclophanes can often suffer from harsh reaction conditions, long reaction times, and sometimes low yields using stepwise methods. We have previously reported an efficient, high&#8208;yielding, metalloid&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly method to prepare disulfide, thioether, and hydrocarbon cyclophanes and cages that feature mercaptomethyl&#8208;arenes as starting materials. Herein, we report the synthesis of 21 new disulfide and thioether assemblies that expand this high yielding self&#8208;assembly method to a wide breadth of macrocycles and cages with diverse structures. Remarkably, the high&#8208;yielding, efficient syntheses still proceed under dynamic covalent control using electron&#8208;deficient, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, spiro, and even short alkenyl/alkynyl substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Cyclopropanation of 2&#8208;Cyano&#8208;3&#8208;arylacrylates Using Carbohydrate&#8208;based Crown Ethers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioenriched, highly functionalized cyclopropane derivatives were prepared by a simple and green approach using monosaccharide&#8208;based chiral crown ethers as phase transfer catalysts. The Michael&#8208;initiated ring closure (MIRC) reactions of diethyl bromomalonate with 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;3&#8208;phenylacrylate took place with complete diastereoselectivity in the presence of chiral lariat ethers derived from carbohydrates and enantioselectivity up to 87% ee was achieved. Among the catalysts tested, the monoaza&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 lariat ether having a methyl &#946;&#8208;  d  &#8208;glucopyranoside unit and a 2&#8208;(3,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl group on the nitrogen generated the highest asymmetric induction (87% ee). In the reactions of analogous 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;3&#8208;arylacrylates, enantioselectivity was in the range of 8&#8208;91% ee.</dc:description>

         <title>The Selective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Allylation of C3&#8208;Unprotected Indoles under Mild and Clean Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indoles are selectively N&#8208;allylated according to a salt&#8208;free nickel catalyzed reaction with allylic alcohols as co&#8208;reagents. The use of DMSO as the reaction solvent is crucial to control the regioselectivity of the reaction with the exclusive formation of the N&#8208;allyl product among up to three possible products.







Abstract
A simple salt free and selective N&#8208;allylation of indoles with allylic alcohols has been developed. The protocol uses a catalytic amount of a nickel complex generated in&#8197;situ from Ni(cod)2 and dppf as diphosphine. The use of DMSO as the reaction solvent is crucial to control the regioselectivity of the reaction with the exclusive formation of the N&#8208;allyl product among up to three possible products.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction of Aryl Iodides and Glycal Enones: Application in the Preparation of Dapagliflozin Analogues</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide range of aryl iodides bearing electron&#8208;donating and withdrawing groups underwent oxidative C&#8208;1 arylation with enones derived from glycals in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 and AgNO3 under ligand&#8208;free conditions. The developed methodology was successfully applied in the preparation of dapagliflozin analogues (SGLT&#8208;2 inhibitor).







Abstract
An efficient approach for the preparation of C&#8208;1 aryl enones from aryl iodides and glycal enones by palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions under ligand&#8208;free conditions was developed. A wide range of aryl iodides bearing electron&#8208;donating and withdrawing groups underwent oxidative C&#8208;1 arylation with galactal, glucal and rhamnal enones in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 and AgNO3 under mild conditions. The protecting groups, including benzyl, acetyl, pivaloyl, and benzoyl groups, were found to be compatible under standard reaction conditions. The developed methodology was applied for the preparation of dapagliflozin analogues (SGLT&#8208;2 inhibitors). Regioselective nitration of C&#8208;1 aryl enones provides C&#8208;2 nitro aryl enones in good yields.

         <title>Selectfluor Mediated Difunctionalization of Olefins towards the Synthesis of Fluoromethylated Morpholines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Selectfluor&#8208;mediated synthesis of monofluoromethylated morpholines has been developed via the oxyfluorination of N&#8208;allylated aminoalcohols. This olefin difunctionalization strategy provides an access to a new chemical space utilizing readily available starting materials, exhibits good functional group compatibility, and can be performed on a gram scale.







Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free oxyfluorination of olefins with concomitant cyclization has been developed as a route towards monofluoromethylated morpholines. Selectfluor was employed as a fluorinating reagent as well as an oxidant to activate olefins. This strategy provides access to a new chemical space using aminoalcohol derived nitrogen&#8208;tethered alkene precursors.

         <dc:description>Ynamides are useful and versatile building blocks in organic synthesis, from which 1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobutadienes (TCBD) can be prepared for application in molecular electronics. However, their insertion onto multi&#8208;functional molecular scaffold remains a synthetic challenge. In this work, we report the two&#8208;steps synthesis in good isolated yield (64% overall, 89% stepwise) of a tetraphenylethylene (TPE) bearing four ynamides, and its further one&#8208;step conversion into the tetra&#8208;TCBD derivative through a [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;retroelectrocyclization sequence. The concomitant formation of the four ynamides required a specific optimisation of the reaction conditions. Although a poor fluorescent emitter in solution, the tetra&#8208;TCBD compound displayed near&#8208;infrared luminescence in the solid state which is an attractive optoelectronic feature when considering future applications in molecular electronic devices  .</dc:description>

         <title>Bilateral Aromatic Extension of Corannulene Nucleus</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work explores bilateral aromatic extension of the corannulene nucleus through a combination of Heck and Mallory reactions.







Abstract
Herein we show that a dibromo imide derivative of corannulene could be subjected to a palladium&#8208;catalyzed Heck reaction in order to install aryl vinylene groups in a bilateral fashion on the C5&#8208;symmetric aromatic nucleus. A photochemically&#8208;induced oxidative cyclization then affords &#960;&#8208;extended structures in isolated overall yields of 35&#8211;44&#8201;%. Due to the aromatic area extension and the presence of electron withdrawing groups, the synthesized molecules exhibit an anodic shift of &#8776;1&#8197;V in their first reduction potential as compared to pristine corannulene. The bilateral growth of the aromatic scaffold, therefore, represents a viable strategy to prepare &#960;&#8208;extended corannulenes with an electron deficient character.

         <title>Black Swan in Phase Transfer Catalysis: Influence of Mixing Mode on the Stereoselectivity of Glycosylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of mixing mode on the outcome of the glycosylation under phase transfer conditions (batch vs flow) is found to be more complicated than it is generally assumed. A change in the way reagents are mixed leads not only to the enhanced mass transfer and consequently higher yield but also to a change in reaction mechanism.







Abstract
Phase transfer catalysis (PTC) is widely used for the preparation of anomerically pure aryl glycosides by glycosylation of phenols with glycosyl halides. Here, we attempted to synthesize 4&#8208;(3&#8208;chloropropoxy)phenyl (CPP) sialoside &#8211; a useful Janus glycoside for neoglycoconjugate synthesis. A batch glycosylation reaction under typical PTC conditions (N&#8208;acetylsialyl chloride, 4&#8208;(3&#8208;chloropropoxy)phenol, Bu4NHSO4, AcOEt, 10&#8201;% aq Na2CO3) resulted in formation of CPP sialoside as a single anomer, albeit in low yield. Conversely, the PTC glycosylation in flow using Comet X&#8208;01 micromixer doubled the yield of CPP sialoside, which was obtained as a mixture of anomers suggesting the change in the reaction mechanism apparently induced by the change in mixing mode. An increase in flow rate led to further loss of stereoselectivity while the use of T&#8208;shaped mixer increased stereoselectivity. Similar results were obtained for N,N&#8208;diacetylsialyl chloride and two other para&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;substituted phenols suggesting generality of the discovered phenomenon.

         <title>Syntheses of 6,7&#8208;Benzotropolone by Using Ring&#8208;Closing Metathesis Variants Obviating a Strongly Acidic Hydrolysis Thereafter</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring&#8208;closing metatheses (RCM) afforded benzocycloheptadienones. Their carbonyl groups were neighbored not by 2&#215;OMe, as in our original approach, but by OMe+SPh, by 2&#215;Cl or by 1&#215;OtBu, 1&#215;SPh or 1&#215;SO2Ph. Any of these changes allowed to proceed to 6,7&#8208;benzotropolone without invoking a Br&#248;nsted acid, let alone the hours of exposure to hot TsOH/MeCN required for processing the compound substituted by 2&#215;OMe.







Abstract
A Wittig reaction of 3&#8208;hydroxyphtalide (11) gave ortho&#8208;styrene&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid (12). Its Weinreb amide 13 acylated heterosubstituted methyllithiums. This led to aryl &#8220;methyl&#8221; ketones whose sp3&#8208;carbon was substituted by Cl+OMe (in 14&#8201;a), 2&#215;Cl (in 14&#8201;b), OtBu (in 17&#8201;a), SPh (in 17&#8201;b) or SO2Ph (in 17&#8201;c). The enolates of these ketones were C&#8208;allylated. This furnished the benzene&#8208;fused nona&#8208;1,8&#8208;dienones 7&#8201;a&#8211;b and 9&#8201;a&#8211;c, respectively. Ring&#8208;closing metatheses provided the corresponding benzocycloheptadienones 8&#8201;a&#8208;b and 10&#8201;a&#8211;c. Their ketone moieties were &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted (in 8&#8201;a&#8211;b) or &#945;&#8208;monosubstituted (in 10&#8201;a&#8211;c). Each substitution pattern allowed to generate the hydroxyenone motif of the corresponding benzocycloheptatrienone&#8212;or 6,7&#8208;benzotropolone&#8212;6&#8201;a: The MeO&#8208; and PhS&#8208;containing benzocycloheptadienone 8&#8201;a gave 6,7&#8208;benzotropolone methyl ether (15) by sulfoxide formation and pyrolysis; 15 was demethylated with BCl3. The same intermediate resulted from the dichlorobenzocycloheptadienone 8&#8201;b and NaOMe. The benzocycloheptadienone 10&#8201;a was de(tert&#8208;butylated) with formic acid; a subsequent Pfitzner&#8208;Moffatt oxidation completed 6,7&#8208;benzotropolone (6&#8201;a) once more. The PhS&#8208;containing benzocycloheptadienone 10&#8201;b was &#945;&#8208;acetoxylated with Pb(OAc)4; the resulting O,S&#8208;acetal gave 6,7&#8208;benzotropolone (6&#8201;a) by hydrolysis. The PhSO2&#8208;containing substrate 10&#8201;c was deprotonated whereupon an oxidation with Me3Si&#8722;O&#8722;O&#8722;SiMe3 gave 6,7&#8208;benzotropolone (6&#8201;a).

         <title>Sustainable Mechanosynthesis of Biologically Active Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemistry contributes to the sustainable preparation of molecules in many areas of chemistry. This Review focuses on the mechanosynthesis of known APIs and biologically evaluated new entities (medicinal mechanochemistry), mostly heterocycles, metal complexes, and peptides.







Abstract
Synthetic mechanochemistry, the use of mechanical force produced by milling, grinding or extruding, as an activation technique, provides access to chemical entities of all kinds. This Review is focused on examples reported so far of known Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), and effectively evaluated bioactive molecules, all prepared by mechanosynthesis. Three families of molecules are discussed: heterocyclic compounds, metal complexes and peptides. Advantages of the mechanochemistry approach are highlighted especially from a green chemistry and efficacy point of view.

         <title>A Modular Synthesis of Teraryl&#8208;Based &#945;&#8208;Helix Mimetics, Part&#8197;3: Iodophenyltriflate Core Fragments Featuring Side Chains of Proteinogenic Amino Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of iodophenyltriflate compounds decorated with the side chains of the proteinogenic amino acids Arg, Asn, Asp, Met, Trp and Tyr is reported. These fragments the set of building blocks for the modular assembly of teraryl&#8208;based alpha&#8208;helix mimetics through sequential Pd cross&#8208;coupling.







Abstract
Teraryl&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;helix mimetics have proven to be useful compounds for the inhibition of protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPI). We have developed a modular and flexible approach for the synthesis of teraryl&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;helix mimetics using a benzene core unit featuring two leaving groups of differentiated reactivity in the Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling used for teraryl assembly. In previous publications we have introduced the methodology of 4&#8208;iodophenyltriflates decorated with the side chains of some of the proteinogenic amino acids. We herein report the core fragments corresponding to the previously missing amino acids Arg, Asn, Asp, Met, Trp and Tyr. Therefore, our set now encompasses all relevant amino acid analogues with the exception of His. In order to be compatible with the triflate moiety, some of the nucleophilic side chains had to be provided in a protected form to serve as stable building blocks. Additionally, cross&#8208;coupling procedures for the assembly of teraryls were investigated.

         <dc:description>
A set of 5&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;pyridine boronic acid pinacol esters decorated with the side chains of all proteinogenic amino acids relevant in protein&#8208;protein interactions is reported. This work completes our efforts towards a library of building blocks for the modular assembly of teraryl&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;helix mimetics via sequential Pd cross&#8208;coupling.







Abstract
Teraryl&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;helix mimetics have proven to be useful compounds for the inhibition of protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPI). We have developed a modular and flexible approach for the synthesis of teraryl&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;helix mimetics using pyridine containing boronic acid building blocks to increase the water solubility. Following our initial publication in which we have introduced the methodology in combination with sequential Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling for teraryl assembly, we can now report a complete set of pyridine based boronic acid building blocks decorated with side chains of all proteinogenic amino acids relevant for PPI (Ala, Arg, Asn, Asp, Cys, Gln, Glu, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Ser, Thr, Trp, Tyr, Val) to complement the core fragment set. For a representative set of teraryls we have studied the influence of the pyridine rings on the solubility of the assembled oligoarenes.

         <dc:description>
A series of para&#8208;bromoiodoarene compounds decorated with the side chains of all proteinogenic amino acids is reported. These fragments serve as building blocks for the modular assembly of teraryl&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;helix mimetics via sequential Pd cross&#8208;coupling. Compared to our established iodotriflate approach, the new building blocks showed higher stability and better reactivity under cross&#8208;coupling conditions.







Abstract
Teraryl&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;helix mimetics have proven to be useful compounds for the inhibition of protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPI). We have developed a modular and flexible approach for the synthesis of teraryl&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;helix mimetics using a benzene core unit featuring two halide leaving groups of differentiated reactivity in the Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling used for teraryl assembly. The use of para&#8208;bromo iodoarene core fragments resolved the issue of hydrolysis during cross&#8208;coupling that was observed when using triflate as a leaving group. We report a complete set of para&#8208;bromoiodoarene core fragments decorated with side chains of all proteinogenic amino acids relevant for PPI (Ala, Arg, Asn, Asp, Cys, Gln, Glu, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Ser, Thr, Trp, Tyr and Val). In order to be compatible with general cross&#8208;coupling conditions, some of the nucleophilic side chains had to be provided in a protected form to serve as stable building blocks.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended peri&#8208;Acenes: Recent Progress in Synthesis and Characterization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
peri&#8208;Acenes represent an important class of materials for organic (opto)electronic and spintronic devices. This Review provides a summary of the recent progress in the precision synthesis and characterization of peri&#8208;acenes and their &#960;&#8208;extended systems via on&#8208;surface or wet chemistry as well as the outlooks in this research field.







Abstract
Nanographenes (NGs) with open&#8208;shell character have gained intense attention due to their potential applications in future organic nanoelectronics and spintronics. Among them, NGs bearing a pair of parallel zigzag edges, such as acenes and peri&#8208;acenes (PAs) bestow unique (opto)electronic and magnetic properties owing to their localized non&#8208;bonding &#960;&#8208;state. However, their reactive zigzag edges impart intrinsic instability, leading to the challenging synthesis. The recent development of synthetic strategies provided access to several &#960;&#8208;extended PAs, which were considered unrealistic for decades. Notably, their laterally &#960;&#8208;extended structures of zigzag&#8208;edged graphene nanoribbons was realised via on&#8208;surface synthesis. However, synthesis of &#960;&#8208;extended PAs in solution is still in its infancy, more intensive scientific efforts are needed to surpass the existing challenges regarding stability and solubility. This Review provides an overview of recent progress in the synthesis and characterization of PAs through a bottom&#8208;up synthetic strategy, including on&#8208;surface and solution&#8208;phase chemistry. In addition, views on existing challenges and the future prospects are also provided.

         <title>Chasing Polycyclic Natural Products: 5/6/5&#8208; or 5/6/6&#8208;Carbotricyclic Scaffold Construction via Stereodivergent Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction of Chiral Hydrindanes and Their Boron Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 4&#8208;substituted tetrahydroindanones with cyclic and acyclic dienes was examined. By choosing acidic or thermal conditions, the diastereoselectivity on the newly formed ring could be controlled and was rationalized by high&#8208;level computations. Additionally, boron complexation of the 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl moiety exhibited unexpected selectivity in the cycloaddition.







Abstract
Chiral trans&#8208;hydrindanes (bicyclo[4.3.0]nonanes) are important building blocks of polycyclic natural products. In order to access 5/6/5&#8208; and 5/6/6&#8208;carbotricyclic scaffolds scope and limitation of [4+2] cycloadditions of tetrahydroindanones with various dienes were studied. Cyclopentadiene gave a tetracylic endo&#8208;(R,R)&#8208;diastereomer under acid&#8208;catalysis, whereas thermal conditions provided the endo&#8208;(S,S)&#8208;diastereomer with the opposite diastereofacial selectivity. The stereodivergent outcome was rationalized by high&#8208;level quantum&#8208;chemical computations which revealed the acid&#8208;catalysis to be a kinetically controlled reaction and the thermal cycloaddition to be under thermodynamic control. Stereochemical assignment of the cycloadducts was facilitated by conversion of the 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls with BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 into BF2&#8208;chelate complexes. Subsequent thermal Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of BF2&#8208; or BBN&#8208;chelates (from 9&#8208;BBN&#8208;OTf) gave endo/exo&#8208;mixtures of the (R,R)&#8208; and (S,S)&#8208;diastereomers, while more elevated temperatures yielded primarily the endo/exo&#8208;(S,S)&#8208;diastereomers. Thermal [4+2] cycloadditions with 2,3&#8208;dimethylbutadiene proceeded with lower diastereoselectivity as the reaction was kinetically controlled according to calculations. Attempted Diels&#8208;Alder&#8208;reactions with furan gave furyl&#8208;substituted indanones rather than cycloadducts.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Antibiotic Properties of Amino&#8208;Functionalized Aromatic Terpenoids Related to Erogorgiaene and the Pseudopterosins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An additional amino&#8208;alkyl side chain makes the difference: A series of amino&#8208;functionalized analogs of marine diterpenoids were prepared by stereoselective total synthesis and characterized with respect to their antibiotic properties. While the phenolic intermediates showed activity only against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, the amines proved to be active also against Gram&#8208;negative bacterial strains.







Abstract
Following a concept recently introduced by Hergenrother,[6] the present study addresses the question of whether certain antimicrobially active aromatic (marine) natural products can be converted into more potent broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotics by introducing an aminoalkyl side chain. To this end, phenolic mono&#8208; and sesquiterpenoids (incl. carvacrol, xanthorrhizol, and 7&#8208;hydroxycalamene) as well as the diterpenes 7&#8208;hydroxyerogorgiaene and 9&#8208;deoxypseudopterosin A were converted into amino&#8208;functionalized analogs that display either an amino&#8208;methyl or a 2&#8208;amino&#8208;ethoxy substituent in place of (or next to) the OH group. This was achieved either by Pd&#8208;catalyzed nitromethylation/reduction of the aryltriflates, by O&#8208;alkylation of the phenols with bromoacetonitrile and subsequent reduction, or by ortho&#8208;hydroxymethylation/amination. During the study, an efficient enantioselective total synthesis of 7&#8208;hydroxyerogorgiaene (8 steps, 29&#8201;% overall yield) and 9&#8208;deoxypseudopterosin A (9 steps, 30&#8201;% overall yield) was elaborated using an asymmetric cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrovinylation (91&#8201;% ee) of 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;styrene as the chirogenic step. Other important C&#8722;C bond forming steps include a Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling and diastereoselective Lewis acid&#8208;mediated cyclization reactions. A total of 16 amino derivatives of natural products were prepared and subsequently tested for their antibacterial properties. Some of the diterpene&#8208;derived amines showed high efficacy, not only against Gram&#8208;positive (S. aureus SG511, S. aureus HG003, B. subtilis 168; MIC=0.5 to 2&#8197;&#956;g/ml), but also against Gram&#8208;negative bacterial strains (E. coli K12; E. coli I&#8208;11276b; MIC=8 to 32&#8197;&#956;g/ml). This clearly supported the underlying working hypothesis.

         <title>Bisubstrate Strategies to Target Methyltransferases</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methyltransferases (MTases) use the cofactor S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM) to transfer a methyl group to a diverse set of biomolecules (DNA, RNA, proteins, small molecules). These enzymes play a crucial role in the regulation of many biological processes. In this Review, for each type of MTase, synthetic bisubstrate inhibitors designed as substrate analogs covalently linked to a SAM analog are presented.







Abstract
Bisubstrate strategies address the lack of specificity encountered with S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM) analogues targeting methyltransferases (MTases). Specifically, a bisubstrate inhibitor mimics the transition state complex associating a substrate and the SAM methyl group donor to a particular methyltransferase. These potential inhibitors contain both parts of the substrate and the methyl group donor. In this review, bisubstrate inhibitors of several MTases including DNA, RNA, protein, catechol or nicotinamide MTases are discussed in order to evaluate the interest of these promising molecules for the development of selective therapeutics against cancers, neuropsychiatric disorders and viral infections.

         <title>Coordination Chemistry of Borane in Solution: Application to a STING Agonist</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Equilibrium constants were determined for ligand exchange reactions of borane complexes with various oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen and phosphorus nucleophiles in solution, and a binding affinity scale was built spanning a range of 12 orders of magnitude. While the K eq are minimally dependent on the solvent, the rate of ligand exchange varies significantly. The fastest and slowest rates were observed in THF and CDCl  3  , respectively. Moreover, the ligand exchange rate differs in a very broad range depending on stability of the starting complex. Binding of BH  3  was found to be much more sensitive to steric factors than protonation. Comparing nitrogen bases having equal steric properties, a linear correlation of BH  3  binding affinity vs. Br&#248;nsted acidity was found. This correlation can be used to quickly estimate the BH  3  binding affinity of a substrate if p K a is known. Kinetic studies suggest the ligand exchange to occur as a bimolecular S N 2 reaction unless other nucleophilic species were present in the reaction mixture.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Oxyfluorination/Oxydifluorination vs. Diketonization of Phthalimido&#8208;Protected Propargylamines with Selectfluor</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective formation of &#945;&#8208;fluoro,&#946;&#8208;phthalimido ketones, &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro, &#946;&#8208;phthalimido ketones or &#946;&#8208;phthalimido &#945;&#8208;diketones is described by means of gold&#8208;catalyzed oxyfluorination/oxydifluorination or dioxygenation reactions. The simultaneous assembly of the quinoxaline nucleus and the removal of the phthalimido&#8208;protecting group were also performed.







Abstract
Alkyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;substituted N&#8208;propargyl phthalimides were used as valuable building blocks for the selective formation of the corresponding &#945;&#8208;fluoro, &#946;&#8208;phthalimido ketones, &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro, &#946;&#8208;phthalimido ketones or &#946;&#8208;phthalimido &#945;&#8208;diketones by means of gold&#8208;catalyzed oxyfluorination/oxydifluorination or dioxygenation reactions. The key factors addressing the product selectivity control were determined. The simultaneous assembly of the quinoxaline nucleus and the removal of the phthalimido&#8208;protecting group were tested. Reaction mechanisms of the different reaction pathways are assumed.

         <title>Dual Catalysis in Rhodium(II) Carbenoid Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review describes the recent developments of dual catalysis in rhodium (II) carbenoid chemistry, where rhodium is cooperatively working with a second transition metal (Sc/Pd/Ag/Au) or organocatalyst. The redox compatibility, turnover pathways, and the generation of unique rhodium&#8208;bound zwitterionic intermediates make rhodium an attractive partner for dual catalysis reactions to enable new transformations.







Abstract
Dual catalysis represents an alternative archetype in carbene chemistry that surpasses traditional single catalyst systems. By employing dual catalyst systems, one can improve the efficiency of existing reactions and enable new chemical transformations. Reactions involving dual synergistic catalysis are increasingly valuable as they offer convenient strategies for synthesizing challenging quaternary carbon centers and bioactive core structures. This review article focuses on trapping diazo&#8208;derived, rhodium (II) zwitterionic intermediates with varying electrophiles such as Michael acceptors, alkynes, &#960;&#8208;allyl Pd(II) complexes, and the Nicholas intermediate.

         <title>Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors Featuring a Porphyrin Scaffold: Synthesis, Optical and Biological Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetrafunctionalized zinc porphyrin with coumarin is able to accumulate on cell membrane by targeting selectively membrane&#8208;bound tumour&#8208;associated CA IX/CAXII, to impair pancreas cancer cell proliferation and to kill them by photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
The synthesis, characterization and study of optical properties of innovative tetrafunctionalized zinc(II) porphyrins with carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors in sulfonamide and coumarin series are described. The synthetic methodology relies on the preparation of the porphyrin core by condensation of azido triethyleneglycol functionalized benzaldehyde derivative with pyrrole followed by its metalation and inhibitors coupling via Huisgen click&#8208;reaction. The tetrafunctionalized zinc(II) porphyrin with coumarin moieties showed selective inhibition against tumour&#8208;associated hCA IX and hCA XII versus the cytosolic off&#8208;targets hCA I and hCA II. This compound was able to accumulate on cell membrane and to impair pancreas cancer cells (Capan&#8208;1) proliferation in normoxic conditions with LC50 of 4.5&#8197;&#956;M. Moreover, its optical properties revealed efficient photosensitizing properties, leading to cancer cells death under light irradiation, making this compound a suitable candidate for photodynamic therapy.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Magnoshinin and (+)&#8208;Merrilliaquinone: Application of a Late&#8208;Stage Oxidative Functionalization Protocol</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A late&#8208;stage oxidative functionalization using DDQ and subsequent chemoselective oxidative demethylation enables the synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;magnoshinin and (+)&#8208;merrilliaquinone.







Abstract
A unified approach for the first enantioselective total synthesis of magnoshinin and merrilliaquinone is reported. The key feature of the synthesis is the DDQ assisted chemoselective late&#8208;stage oxidative functionalization of the polyoxygenated chiral tetralin core accessed by utilizing the relayed asymmetric induction strategy. Then, the follow&#8208;up of chemoselective redox chemistry facilitates the synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;magnoshinin (28.2&#8201;% overall yield) and (+)&#8208;merrilliaquinone (20.6&#8201;% overall yield) along the shortest route, starting from the known 3&#8208;(2,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl)propanoic acid.

         <title>Continuous Flow Synthesis of Sulfur&#8208; and Selenium&#8722;NHC Compounds (NHC=N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first continuous flow syntheses of thiourea and selenourea N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;based derivatives are reported. The use of homogeneous and heterogeneous weak base flow setups allows for unprecedent short reaction times (2&#8211;5&#8197;min) under mild conditions using green solvents.







Abstract
The first continuous flow syntheses of sulfur&#8208; and selenium&#8722;NHC (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) adducts in unprecedented short reaction times and high yields are reported. The importance of these species in coordination chemistry or as efficient tools for determining the &#960;&#8208;acceptor character of NHC ligands make any improvement in their synthesis a worthy goal. Thiourea derivatives bearing both saturated and unsaturated NHCs were obtained using NEt3 as a weak base (homogeneous setup) in conjunction with a bed of elemental sulfur (S8). The synthetic route proving optimal for selenoureas involves the use of a simple Se/K2CO3 heterogeneous microreactor design.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydroallylation of Vinylsilanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing readily available vinylsilanes as the latent nucleophiles to asymmetrically couple with allylic phosphates through CuH catalysis has been successfully developed under very mild reaction conditions. Consequently, a range of optically active organosilanes were synthesized with general good yields with up to 96&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroallylation of readily available vinylsilanes with allylic phosphates in the presence of hydrosilane was developed. These transformations can be performed under mild reaction conditions and provide the useful chiral organosilanes with good to excellent level of enantiocontrol.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Benzylic Silylation of Diarylmethyl Carbonates with Silylboranes under Base&#8208;Free Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed benzylic silylation reaction of diarylmethyl carbonates with silylboranes has been developed. By taking advantage of in&#8208;situ generated alkoxide ligand arising from the carbonate substrate, the reaction proceeds smoothly even under external base&#8208;free conditions. The resulting benzyl silane moiety can undergo the post functionalizations to deliver the more complex diarylmethane derivatives. Additionally, the related base&#8208;free allylic silylation reaction is also demonstrated.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed benzylic silylation of diarylmethyl carbonates with silylboranes has been developed. The reaction proceeds smoothly even under external base&#8208;free conditions, and the corresponding benzylic silanes are formed in good to high yields. The obtained benzyl silane derivatives can work as the benzylic nucleophiles by the action of a suitable fluoride source and react with some carbon electrophiles to deliver the corresponding benzylic C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupled products. Additionally, while still preliminary, the allylic silylation of the isoelectronic allylic carbonates is also achieved.

         <dc:description>
The regioselective ring&#8208;opening of 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;sulfamidates with fluorine anion is reported. Construction of monofluoro&#8208;substituted amines and amino acid derivatives is realized by using inexpensive potassium fluoride (KF). The monofluorination process only needs 35&#8197;minutes under heating, which will be an attractive new route for the synthesis of the PET fluorine&#8208;18 radiotracer.

         <dc:description>
A mild Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed double alkyne benzannulation reaction onto a phenathrene moiety results in the rapid synthesis of &#960;&#8208;extended [4]helicene hybrids. Substitution of the cove region results in increased inversion barriers and allows for separation and study of the enantiomers by circular dichroism.







Abstract
A mild and efficient synthesis of a broad scope of substituted naphtho[1,2&#8208;a]pyrene derivatives was accomplished in good yields using an InCl3/AgNTf2&#8208;mediated two&#8208;fold alkyne benzannulation reaction. HPLC enantiomeric separation was achieved and the interconversion barriers have been determined. The ECD spectra of two derivatives were recorded and interpreted through TD&#8208;DFT calculations. Raman spectra were also recorded and predicted through DFT calculations.

         <title>Multi&#8208;catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Diols Containing a Tetrasubstituted Fluorinated Stereocenter</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a multi&#8208;catalytic sequence, valuable enantioenriched 1,3&#8208;diols containing a challenging tetrasubstituted fluorinated stereocenter could easily be prepared. The sequence involves an organocatalyzed fluorination of disubstituted aldehydes followed by a diastereoselective copper&#8208;catalyzed aldol reaction. From the aldol adduct, ketone reduction followed by enantioselective organocatalyzed Kinetic Resolution provided the diols in &gt;90&#8201;%&#8201;ee.







Abstract
The enantioselective construction of fluorohydrins featuring a tetrasubstituted stereocenter embedded in complex frameworks represents an important challenge. Herein, we report a multicatalytic strategy enabling the stereoselective preparation of a new type of scaffold containing such a challenging fluorohydrin motif. The sequence is based on an organocatalyzed fluorination of &#945;&#8208;disubstituted aldehydes followed by a diastereoselective copper&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative aldol reaction.

     alt="Multi-catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of 1,3-Diols Containing a Tetrasubstituted Fluorinated Stereocenter"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through a multi-catalytic sequence, valuable enantioenriched 1,3-diols containing a challenging tetrasubstituted fluorinated stereocenter could easily be prepared. The sequence involves an organocatalyzed fluorination of disubstituted aldehydes followed by a diastereoselective copper-catalyzed aldol reaction. From the aldol adduct, ketone reduction followed by enantioselective organocatalyzed Kinetic Resolution provided the diols in &amp;gt;90&#8201;%&#8201;&lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enantioselective construction of fluorohydrins featuring a tetrasubstituted stereocenter embedded in complex frameworks represents an important challenge. Herein, we report a multicatalytic strategy enabling the stereoselective preparation of a new type of scaffold containing such a challenging fluorohydrin motif. The sequence is based on an organocatalyzed fluorination of &#945;-disubstituted aldehydes followed by a diastereoselective copper-catalyzed decarboxylative aldol reaction. Reduction of the generated &#946;-hydroxy ketone followed by a Lewis base-catalyzed kinetic resolution enables the isolation of original fluorinated 1,3-diols with perfect diastereo- and enantio-control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Accessing Medicinally Relevant O&#8208;Benzofused Heterocycles through C&#8722;X Activation: Recent Trends</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of heterocyclic scaffolds through C&#8722;X activation has thrived in recent years as an effective approach to access various structures for several purposes. In this Review, we cover the latest high&#8208;impacting work targeting benzofused O&#8208;heterocycles, highlighting the applicability of both palladium and copper catalysts for the C&#8722;X activation steps.







Abstract
In this Review, we address the recent advances in the elaboration of medicinally relevant oxygen benzofused heterocycles by palladium and copper catalyzed C&#8722;X activation of halo arene precursors. This attractive transformation has shown remarkable versatility and efficiency as a synthetic toolkit leading to the construction of numerous scaffolds with high structural diversity in an atom&#8208;economical manner. We covered recent examples that considered the application of this strategy using miscellaneous coupling partners and conditions. The haloarene motif has proven to be an exceptional candidate principally due to its availability and cost, and in this review, we showcase relevant and appropriate examples of its use in catalytic reactions leading to medicinally important targets.

         <title>Free&#8208;Radical Epimerization of d&#8208; into l&#8208;C&#8208;(Glycosyl)methanol Compounds Using 1,5&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation of enantiomerically pure cis&#8208;C&#8208;glycosyl compounds, through a long&#8208;range epimerization at C5 of readily accessible d&#8208; or l&#8208;carbohydrates, by means of a remote reductive radical sequence was described. A comparative study of the radical process promoted by a tin reagent or with photoredox conditions was also performed. The stereochemical and polarity influence of the substituents in the course of the radical sequence was considered.







Abstract
A simple epimerization of C&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;Glyp)methanol into C&#8208;(&#946;&#8208;l&#8208;Glyp)methanol compounds is described. The radical sequence involved homolytic cleavage of the C5&#8722;H bond by 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer promoted by the 1&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;yl radical and subsequent hydride addition with inversion of configuration. This methodology allows the preparation of rare C&#8208;(&#946;&#8208;l&#8208;Idop)&#8208;, C&#8208;(&#946;&#8208;l&#8208;Altp)&#8208;, C&#8208;(&#946;&#8208;l&#8208;Gulp)&#8208;, C&#8208;(&#946;&#8208;l&#8208;Allp)methanol glycosides starting from carbohydrates of the d&#8208;series. It can also be applied to transform l&#8208; into d&#8208;configured C&#8208;glycosyl compounds, as illustrated by the formation of C&#8208;(&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;6dGulp)&#8208; and C&#8208;(&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;6dAltp)methanol from readily accessible l&#8208;rhamno and l&#8208;fuco analogs, respectively. In further development of this procedure compounds with C&#8208;(&#946;&#8208;l&#8208;Araf)&#8208; and C&#8208;(&#946;&#8208;l&#8208;5dRibf)methanol structures have also been synthesized. The alkoxyl radicals were generated by reaction of the corresponding N&#8208;alkoxyphthalimides with nBu3SnH(D) and in comparative terms, by visible light&#8208;photocatalysis using the Hantzsch ester/fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 procedure. The influence of the sugar ring conformation and the electronegativity of the substituents on the stereochemical outcome will be addressed.

         <title>From Biomass to the Karrikins via Selective Catalytic Oxidation of Hemicellulose&#8208;Derived Butyl Xylosides and Glucosides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective catalytic oxidation of monosaccharides was applied to butyl xylosides and butyl glucosides leading to the formation of bioactive karrikins, molecules that are important in the response to catastrophic fires. Butanosolv processing of biomass provides a co&#8208;product stream that contains these starting materials providing relevance to this work in the biorefinery context.







Abstract
Members of the karrikin family of bioactive small molecules are known to promote germination of a range of plants following large scale fires. As a result, they are relevant and interesting compounds. This report describes their synthesis from a biomass&#8208;derived product stream. During work to fractionate biomass with the goal of obtaining high quality lignins, an interesting co&#8208;product stream derived from the hemicellulose in the biomass, was obtained. Whilst many applications of this co&#8208;product stream can be proposed, in this case the major monosaccharides have been converted to relevant karrikins in short reaction sequences. Key results include a highly selective catalytic oxidation reaction, conversion of the resulting ketone to a butenolide by two alternative approaches, a selective acetal reductive opening reaction, X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of two compounds and detailed comparison of the final products with previous literature reports. Only through successful use of all the components generated during biomass refining, can economic sustainability be potentially achieved.

Greener catalyst, greener solvent: Energy&#8208;transfer process enabled by an organocatalyst (4CzIPN) and using dimethylcarbonate as solvent offers a more sustainable alternative protocol for the formal enyne&#8208;metathesis of 1,7&#8208;enynes.







Abstract
A new approach to access 1,3&#8208;diene derived quinolinone compounds has been realized using a mild reaction protocol employing a metal free catalyst (1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene) (4CzIPN), blue LED as activation source, and benefits from a sustainable solvent dimethylcarbonate (DMC). The mechanism is postulated as an amide&#8208;tethered enyne intramolecular [2+2]&#8208;photocatalyzed cycloaddition&#8208;retrocycloaddition sequence, proceeding via a cyclobutene intermediate species. The methodology offers an efficient route towards decorated 1,3&#8208;diene products.

         <title>Isoprostanoids, Isofuranoids and Isoketals &#8211; From Synthesis to Lipidomics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;enzymatic oxygenated fatty acid metabolites are known as isoprostanoids, isofuranoids and isoketals. These metabolites are formed under oxidative stress and have many biological roles (e.&#8201;g., biomarkers, bioactivity). This Review discusses the main chemical strategies for their synthesis as well as the analytical methods to quantify them in biological samples.







Abstract
A huge diversity of oxygenated metabolites originated from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) had been discovered. Radical cascades are involved in the biosynthesis of these metabolites, and the radical initiation can be performed either inside the active site of an enzyme in the extracellular medium, or in membrane on phospholipids. The development of convergent and flexible chemical strategies to prepare these compounds by organic chemists, along with the development of sophisticated mass spectrometry methods, has boosted the knowledge regarding PUFA metabolites. Also, isoprostanoids have emerged as indicators of oxidative stress in humans and their environment. This Review provides a brief overview on the chemical strategies and analytical methods achieved over the past thirty years.

         <title>Synthesis of Pyranocyclopentaindolines Representing the Western Sections of Janthitrem B, JBIR&#8208;137, and Shearinine&#8197;G</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of pyranocyclopentaindolines: Tetracycles representing the ABCD partial structures of the fungal indole diterpenes janthitrem B, JBIR&#8208;137, and shearinine G were synthesized starting from indoline. The hydroxylated western section of janthitrem B was obtained in eight steps and 10&#8201;% overall yield.







Abstract
The synthesis of the ABCD tetracyclic partial structures of the fungal indole diterpenes janthitrem B, JBIR&#8208;137, and shearinine G is reported. The route starts from 5&#8208;formylated indoline that is coupled to a dihydropyran moiety, followed by Prins cyclization. A diene was obtained that was oxygenated in a divergent manner. The hydroxylated tetracyclic western half of janthitrem B was obtained in eight steps and 10&#8201;% overall yield. We also share our experience with alternative approaches passing via alkynylated precursors. This includes the gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of a 6&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;5&#8208;prenylindoline.

         <title>Acylation of Hexaphenylbenzene for the Synthesis of [5]Cumulenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexaphenylbenzene is appended to [5]cumulenes, a marriage of sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;carbon building blocks for synthetic allotropes.







Abstract
The Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation of hexaphenylbenzene is reported, and the reaction favorably provides the monoacylated products 1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;b. The resulting ketones 1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;b are used as precursors for the formation of [5]cumulenes, including 6&#8201;b in which the sterically demanding HPB moiety affords a diethynyl[5]cumulene that features significant stability (persistence) versus the analog 6&#8201;c which lacks the HPB endgroups. The unsymmetrical substitution pattern of the two most soluble derivatives 6&#8201;b and 6&#8201;c, allows for estimation of rotational barriers for diethynyl[5]cumulenes via VT NMR studies of cis&#8208;trans isomerization. For both molecules, the barrier to rotation is ca. 15&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, which is attenuated in comparison to other [5]cumulenes due to the presence of the ethynyl endgroups.

         <title>Silk&#8722;Fibroin&#8208;Supported Palladium Catalyst for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura and Ullmann Coupling Reactions of Aryl Chlorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silk&#8722;fibroin&#8208;supported palladium catalyst (Pd/SF) was successfully applied in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura and Ullmann coupling reactions of aryl chlorides. Structural investigation of Pd/SF by WAXS analysis, together with the help of a computational model, supported the hypothesis of catalytic pockets where monoatomic Pd species can form stable complexes with SF.







Abstract
Recently, we have reported the preparation of a silk fibroin&#8208;supported Palladium catalyst (Pd/SF) and its use in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of aryl iodides. Since its synthetic applicability and structural features are still far from being fully explored, a deeper investigation is reported here. Pd/SF is tested as a catalyst for the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura and Ullmann coupling reactions of aryl chlorides, in H2O/EtOH solvent mixture under atmospheric conditions. Starting from the analysis of the products of the Pd/SF promoted Ullmann reactions of poly&#8208;haloarenes, we can hypothesize the existence of catalytic pockets where monoatomic palladium species can form stable complexes with SF. To shed light on this hypothesis, Pd/SF is characterized by Wide&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering (WAXS) analysis, which supports the supposition of catalytic pockets. Finally, using a computational model developed by Molecular Mechanic Energy Minimization we have estimated the dimension of the catalytic pocket of Pd/SF (about 15&#8197;&#197;), in good agreement with the experimental results.

         <title>Manifestations of Antiaromaticity in Organic Materials: Case Studies of Cyclobutadiene, Borole, and Pentalene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modern synthetic strategies have enabled the proliferation of seemingly unstable antiaromatic species into several molecular and materials applications. These destabilizing moieties offer a unique way of tuning the electronic properties of organic materials. In this Review, the history, synthetic strategies, and applications of important conjugated building blocks based upon the antiaromatic cores of cyclobutadiene, borole and pentalene are explored.







Abstract
This Review surveys the experimental and synthetic history of three classic antiaromatic cores: cyclobutadiene, borole, and pentalene. The coverage extends from the bare molecular cores to fused or substituted variants that impart thermodynamic or kinetic stability to the antiaromatic systems. Recent studies to utilize the unusual properties of these antiaromatic cores in the context of advanced electronic materials are discussed.

         <dc:description>
Crystallization&#8208;induced diastereomer transformation (CIDT) of a a &#951;,&#947;&#8208;dibromo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketosulfoxide is reported. This process provided an enantiopure stereolabile &#945;&#8208;bromoketone, which after diastereoselective carbonyl group reduction led to the corresponding anti and syn&#8208;bromohydrins with excellent diastereoselectivities. These bromohydrins can be used as precursors for the synthesis of enantiopure 2&#8208;(1&#8208;Hydroxyalkyl)piperidines. The utility of this methodology was illustrated by the diastereodivergent synthesis of hemlock alkaloid (+)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;conhydrine and its diastereomer (&#8722;)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;conhydrine.







Abstract
Diastereodivergent syntheses of the enantiopure hemlock alkaloid (+)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;conhydrine and its diastereomer (&#8722;)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;conhydrine are reported. Our approach relies on efficient Crystallization&#8208;Induced Diastereomer Transformation (CIDT) of an epimeric mixture of a &#951;,&#947;&#8208;dibromo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketosulfoxide, optically pure only at the sulfur atom, that provided a stable &#945;&#8208;bromoketone, and diastereoselective &#946;&#8208;ketosulfoxide reduction that led to the corresponding anti and syn&#8208;bromohydrins with high level of asymmetric induction.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade and Divergent Synthesis of Indolobenzazepines and Indoloquinolines from Nitrogen&#8208;Tethered 1,8&#8208;Diynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cascade hydroamination and cycloisomerization of nitrogen&#8208;tethered 1,8&#8208;diynes proceeded by cationic Au(I) catalysts. The divergent synthesis of indolo[1,7&#8208;ab]benzazepines and indolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinolines was achieved by the choice of phosphine ligands. The fluorescent aza[6]helicene could also be prepared by this protocol.







Abstract
We describe the divergent construction of two nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic systems by gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerizations. The gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade hydroamination and 7&#8208;endo&#8208;dig&#8208;selective cycloisomerization of nitrogen&#8208;tethered 1,8&#8208;diynes yielded indolo[1,7&#8208;ab]benzazepines in one pot. In contrast, when Johnphos&#8208;coordinated gold catalyst was used, the same 1,8&#8208;diynes were transformed into indolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinolines by 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig&#8208;selective cycloisomerization along with rearrangement of the substituent on one of the alkynes. The reaction of a naphthalene&#8208;tethered substrate provided a helically chiral aza[6]helicene.

         <title>Synthesis and Studies of Potential Inhibitors of CD73 Based on a Triazole Scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several series of substituted 1,4,5&#8208;triazole derivatives bearing various aryls, alkyls and indoles groups were synthetized, as inhibitors of 5&#8242;&#8208;ectonucleotidase CD73, and evaluated for their potential inhibitory effect on purified recombinant hCD73 enzyme and in cell&#8208;based assays. Among them, some compounds were found to be potent enzymatic inhibitors at 10&#8197;&#956;M.







Abstract
The ecto&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;nucleotidase CD73 is involved in the production of immunosuppressive adenosine in the tumoral microenvironment and recently became a validated target in immuno&#8208;oncology. To avoid formation of CD73&#8208;produced adenosine, several series of potential inhibitors of the target enzyme based on a triazole scaffold were synthetized and evaluated on recombinant purified hCD73 and in cell&#8208;based assays.

         <title>Direct Access to Unique C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;Acyl Modified Nucleosides through Liebeskind&#8211;Srogl Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient palladium/CuTC cocatalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction procedure for the synthesis of C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;acyl nucleosides from the corresponding nucleoside 5&#8242;&#8208;carbothioates and boronic acids is described. The procedure is fast, efficient, and it tolerates a wide variety of functionalities, thus expanding the so far limited chemical methods for C&#8208;5&#8217; diversification of deoxy&#8208; and ribonucleosides.







Abstract
The chemical functionalization at C&#8208;5&#8217; position of nucleosides has been significantly less studied compared to the C&#8208;1&#8217;, C&#8208;2&#8217; and C&#8208;3&#8217; sugar positions in spite of its potential important role for biological activity. We describe here the synthesis of new carbothioate nucleosides which were then engaged in a Liebeskind&#8208;Srogl reaction with various boronic acids for the preparation of diversely modified C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;acyl nucleosides. Applied to pyrimidine nucleosides in the DNA and RNA series, the reaction showed a broad substrate scope and more than 25 examples were synthesized in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent isolated yields. This general and efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed and Cu(I)&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;coupling represents a convenient method to prepare a diverse set of 5&#8217;&#8208;modified nucleosides and paves the way for further transformation into a variety of potentially bioactive compounds via the possible conversion of the C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;ketone.

&lt;p&gt;An efficient palladium/CuTC cocatalyzed cross-coupling reaction procedure for the synthesis of C-5&#8217;-acyl nucleosides from the corresponding nucleoside 5&#8242;-carbothioates and boronic acids is described. The procedure is fast, efficient, and it tolerates a wide variety of functionalities, thus expanding the so far limited chemical methods for C-5&#8217; diversification of deoxy- and ribonucleosides.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chemical functionalization at C-5&#8217; position of nucleosides has been significantly less studied compared to the C-1&#8217;, C-2&#8217; and C-3&#8217; sugar positions in spite of its potential important role for biological activity. We describe here the synthesis of new carbothioate nucleosides which were then engaged in a Liebeskind-Srogl reaction with various boronic acids for the preparation of diversely modified C-5&#8217;-acyl nucleosides. Applied to pyrimidine nucleosides in the DNA and RNA series, the reaction showed a broad substrate scope and more than 25 examples were synthesized in good-to-excellent isolated yields. This general and efficient Pd-catalyzed and Cu(I)-mediated cross-coupling represents a convenient method to prepare a diverse set of 5&#8217;-modified nucleosides and paves the way for further transformation into a variety of potentially bioactive compounds via the possible conversion of the C-5&#8217;-ketone.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discrepancy Regarding the Dethreading of a Dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 Macrocycle through a Perfluorobutyl End in [2]Pseudorotaxanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and dethreading study of DB24C8&#8208;based pseudorotaxanes are reported. The pseudorotaxane axles contain ammonium and carbamate stations as well as a repulsive nonafluorobutyl group as one of the two extremities. This extremity prevents any threading of the DB24C8. However, dethreading of pseudorotaxanes is possible and the kinetic rate depends on the presence and localization in the encircled axle of secondary sites of interactions (carbamates).







Abstract
Here are reported the synthesis and characterization of four new dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8)&#8208;based ammonium&#8208;containing pseudorotaxanes, for which one of the two encircled axle's extremities consists of a perfluorobutyl moiety. The subsequent dethreading of the DB24C8 over the perfluorobutyl extremity was studied. Although the perfluorobutyl extremity of an ammonium&#8208;containing axle did not allow threading of DB24C8, dethreading of a perfluorobutyl extremity&#8208;containing pseudorotaxane was possible and its rate depended on both the strength of the template&#8208;to&#8208;DB24C8 complex and the nature of the axle. In particular, dethreading process may be assisted by the presence, in the threaded axle, of a poor secondary site of interaction for the DB24C8 and this assistance proved to be higher when this site is close to the DB24C8.

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Synthesis of a Hexapeptide by Fragment Coupling in a Ball Mill</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using solvent&#8208;less techniques such as ball milling, a hexapeptide was synthesized in gram scale without using any toxic solvents. To date, this hexapeptide is the largest precisely controlled amino acid sequence ever synthesized in a ball mill. This study paves the way to future developments for the synthesis of longer peptides (and proteins) by using ball milling.







Abstract
Synthesis of long peptides is generally considered as a challenge to peptide chemists, in addition to producing significant amounts of toxic waste, such as DMF. Here we show that using solvent&#8208;less methods, such as ball milling, enabled the production of the hexapeptide Boc&#8208;(Ala&#8208;Phe&#8208;Gly)2&#8208;OBn at the gram scale with high overall yield (77&#8201;%, 5 linear steps). This is the longest peptide chain synthesized in a ball mill to date, in which the amino acid sequence is precisely controlled. This study complements the current fundamental knowledge required to synthesize longer and more difficult peptide chains (or small proteins) by using peptide fragment couplings in a ball mill.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Polymer Bioconjugates Prepared by Post&#8208;Polymerization Modification of Alternating Copolymers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward strategy is proposed for the synthesis of protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugates using one of the oldest polymers, the poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride). Different poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) copolymers were successfully prepared by RAFT polymerization in dioxane using the 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;propyl dodecyl trithiocarbonate as chain transfer agent (CTA) and AIBN as initiator. Original biomacromolecules were successfully prepared by post&#8208;polymerization modification.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugates have shown great promise in biomedical and life science applications including drug delivery and diagnosis. The current bioconjugation strategies suffer from lack of efficiency and versatility. In this article, poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) copolymers were first prepared by RAFT polymerization and characterized by different analytical techniques. Then, the poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) precursors were functionalized with primary amine such as azidopropylamine and amino poly(ethylene glycol). The reaction of amino compounds with maleic anhydride was found to be a highly efficient, a versatile, and a facile chemical ligation reaction for the synthesis of macromolecules with quantitative yield under mild conditions. The main benefit is the incorporation of a wide range of functionality by easily changing the primary amine compound. For the amphiphilic graft copolymers based on poly(ethylene glycol), aggregation behavior in water was investigated. In a second part, azido&#8208;functionalized polystyrene copolymers were used to prepare a new protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugate by copper&#8208;free click chemistry reaction.
