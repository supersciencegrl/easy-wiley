         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the [3+2] Cycloaddition Reaction of Azomethine Ylides with Methyl Vinyl Ketone in the Triplet Excited State: A Molecular Electron Density Theory Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photochemically induced [3+2] cycloaddition of azomethine ylide with methyl vinyl ketone begins with the formation of a triplet biradical intermediate INT1 via the transition state structure TST1. The formation of the final spirooxindole SOIS0 requires intersystem crossing at INT1. The reaction in the triplet state is only 589 times faster than in the ground state.

The [3+2] cycloaddition (32CA) reaction of an azomethine ylide with methyl vinyl ketone in the ground and first triplet excited states has been studied within the framework of molecular electron density theory. A density functional theory&#8208;based reactivity analysis indicates that, while azomethine ylide behaves as a supernucleophile in both states, vinyl ketone acts as a strong electrophile. This 32CA reaction presents a very low activation energy both in the ground state, 3.40&#8201;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, and in the triplet state, 1.47&#8201;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, in the gas phase. While in the ground state, the 32CA reaction is entirely ortho regio and fully endo stereoselective, in the triplet state it is entirely ortho regioselective but only partially endo stereoselective. In the ground state, the reaction proceeds to form the spirooxindole after passing through the transition state structure, whereas in the triplet state, the reaction stops at a biradical intermediate, which requires an intersystem crossing to yield the final spirooxindole. Analysis of the kinetic parameters of the 32CA reaction in the two states in methanol indicates that in the triplet state, the reaction is only 589 times faster than in the ground state.

Comparative Computational Study on the Robinson&#8211;Gabriel Synthesis and Bischler&#8211;Napieralski Reaction: Density Functional Theory Investigation of T3P&#8208;Mediated Ring Closure</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The detailed comparison of the Bischler&#8211;Napieralski and Robinson&#8211;Gabriel reactions of tryptamides using propylphosphonic anhydride (T3P) that leads to different products in case of a small change in the substrate is provided. The computed mechanistic pathways explain why the oxoalkyl tryptamide derivative selectively reacts in a Robinson&#8211;Gabriel cyclization and does not give any Bischler&#8211;Napieralski product.

Previously, this study reported novel and efficient methods for the Bischler&#8211;Napieralski and Robinson&#8211;Gabriel reactions of tryptamides under microwave conditions using propylphosphonic anhydride (T3P). Furthermore, it presents the first computational study on Bischler&#8211;Napieralski reaction of Nb&#8208;benzoyltryptamine with T3P leading to 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carboline. Here, it provides the detailed comparison of both T3P promoted reactions that actually lead to different products in case of a small change in the substrate. To reveal the effect of the substrate structure, density functional theory (DFT) computations have been performed on the two model tryptamides leading to three different product molecules. The computed mechanistic pathways correspond to the experimental observations and explain why the oxoalkyl tryptamide derivative selectively reacts in a Robinson&#8211;Gabriel cyclization (highest activation Gibbs free energy is 194.9&#8201;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and does not give any Bischler&#8211;Napieralski product (highest activation Gibbs free energy of the pathway is 269.4&#8201;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). It can also be understood why high temperature is required for both reactions. It is the first occasion in the literature that these two reactions are compared by DFT calculations.

Enantioselective Desymmetrization of Bisphenol Derivatives by Organocatalytic Sulfonylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient organocatalytic strategy involving the desymmetrization&#8211;sulfonylation of bisphenols is introduced for the synthesis of chiral 1,1&#8208;diarylalkanes. A chiral thiourea catalyst enables the selective sulfonylation of one hydroxyl group with a sulfonyl chloride in a CHCl3/H2O system under basic conditions, affording the reaction products with high yields and enantioselectivities.

Chiral 1,1&#8208;diarylalkanes are synthesized by enantioselective desymmetrization of bisphenol derivatives through an organocatalytic sulfonylation reaction. The methodology involves the selective sulfonylation of one enantiotopic hydroxyl group of a bisphenol using a sulfonyl chloride with a chiral thiourea catalyst in a CHCl3/H2O system under basic conditions. The resulting products are obtained in good to high yields (up to 97%) with high enantioselectivity (up to 90.5:9.5 er). Remarkably, compounds that are almost enantiomerically pure can be obtained from the mother liquor after crystallization.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Isomerization of Oxabicyclic Alkenes to 1,2&#8208;Naphthalene Oxides: A Density Functional Theory Study</title>

         <dc:description>
Ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed isomerisation of unsymmetrical C1 and aryl&#8208;substituted 7&#8208;oxabenzonorbornadienes is studied using density functional theory (DFT). Elucidating the three&#8208;step catalytic cycle: oxidative addition, &#951;1&#8208; to &#951;3&#8208;allyl isomerisation, and reductive elimination determined the rate&#8208;determining step to be the oxidative addition. DFT calculations provide mechanistic insights into the steric and electronic effects behind the formed regioisomers.

The mechanism and regioselectivity of ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed isomerization of C1&#8208;substituted, unsymmetrical oxabenzonorbornadienes (OBDs) are investigated using density functional theory (DFT). This study elucidates a three&#8208;step catalytic cycle: oxidative addition, &#951;1&#8208; to &#951;3&#8208;allyl isomerization, and reductive elimination. Analysis of the free energy profile identifies oxidative addition as the rate&#8208;determining step and as the primary contributor to regioselectivity. DFT calculations predict that electron&#8208;deficient OBDs preferentially yield 1,2&#8208;naphthalene oxide, while electron&#8208;rich OBDs favor the formation of 1&#8208;naphthol products, in agreement with experimental findings.

         <title>Benzochalcogenodiazoles, Synthesis, and Applications in Medicinal Chemistry and Photomedicine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzochalcogenodiazoles (BXD) including benzoxadiazoles, benzothiadiazoles, and benzoselenadiazoles are initially mainly designed for optoelectronic materials as electron&#8208;deficient cores. Nevertheless, they are now extending their application to biology. In this review, the synthesis of BXDs and their use in medicinal chemistry as lipophilic aromatics and in photomedicinal chemistry as photosensitizers will be presented.

Benzochalcogenodiazoles (BXDs) (BOD: benzoxadiazole, BTD: benzothiadiazole, or BSD: benzoselenadiazole) are aromatic bicyclic compounds, containing chalcogen atoms, with applications ranging from material to medicinal chemistry. The recent developments in their preparation and functionalization are taking advantage of new methodologies such as C&#63743;H activation and photocatalysis. After being almost restricted to organic semiconductor materials for optoelectronics applications, they are gaining more and more interest in medicinal chemistry as lipophilic aromatic fragments. Their unique optical properties make them attractive in biological imaging and in photomedicine, with emission up to the near&#8208;infrared biological transparency window. The nature of the chalcogen atom influences their optical properties, with sulfur and selenium atoms favoring phototherapy over fluorescence. This review will not describe optoelectronic materials and fluorophores based on BXD but will focus on the preparation of BXD&#8208;containing compounds, and their medicinal and photomedicinal applications.

         <title>Tagitinin C, a Sesquiterpene Lactone, and Derivatives as Proteasome Inhibitors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tagitinin C, a sesquiterpene lactone from Tithonia diversifolia, shows a good level of activity on the proteasome system. Although the molecule is sensitive to light, pH changes, and nucleophiles, a derivatization program is devised to build intellectual property and obtain more stable analogs.

Tagitinin C, a germacranolide isolated from Tithonia diversifolia, is shown to be an inhibitor of the proteasome pathway. It is, however, a particularly unstable molecule, sensitive to acids, bases, nucleophiles, and light. Herein, a series of modifications aimed at improving the chemical and biological properties of the molecule is described. This study particularly focuses on isobutyrate chain replacement with other esters or ethers. The key steps are the cross&#8208;conjugated dienone reactivity neutralization by reduction and methylene lactone protection with morpholine or imidazole. Selective saponification of the isobutyrate is also achieved with crude pig liver esterase, leading to tagitinol C in moderate yield. Heliangine from the Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus) and hydroxylated derivatives of tagitinin C from the common sunflower (Helianthus annuus), two abundant field crops, constitute alternative sources of germacranolide derivatives not accessible from tagitinin C. Some esters are more potent than the lead compound, whereas the di&#8208;ethers display higher activity levels, probably due to better in&#8201;vivo stability.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Alkyl enol Ether Synthesis via Microwave&#8208;Promoted, Base&#8208;Catalysed Alkyne Hydroalkoxylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 18, May 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward method for the synthesis of alkyl enol ethers was developed, based upon microwave&#8208;promoted alkyne hydroalkoxylation, requiring only alkyne and alcohol components and mild base catalysis. The reaction displayed broad substrate tolerance and was highly selective for Z&#8208;configured, anti&#8208;Markovnikov enol ether products.







Abstract
The diverse reactivity presented by alkyl enol ethers underpins a wide range of synthetically significant processes. Their synthesis is often achieved by atom&#8208;economical alkyne hydroalkoxylation (i.&#8201;e., addition of an alcohol across an alkyne), either using superbasic conditions or transition metal catalysis. Unfortunately, the harsh conditions of the former approach limit substrate tolerance whilst the latter approach often requires inert, anhydrous conditions and exotic, expensive catalysts. In order to pursue more convenient, general and sustainable methodology for enol ether synthesis, we have developed microwave&#8208;promoted alkyne hydroalkoxylation as an attractive solution. Our optimised conditions employ caesium carbonate as a mild base catalyst and the required alcohol as solvent and reagent, with reaction temperatures from 20&#8211;150&#8201;&#176;C and reaction times from 10&#8211;60 minutes. We have demonstrated that the reaction shows broad tolerance of diverse substrate functionality (e.&#8201;g., ester, ether, carboxylate, nitrile, nitro, halide), including examples of terminal, internal, aryl and alkyl alkynes. Greatest reactivity is observed with electron&#8208;poor alkyne substrates, and the reaction shows near&#8208;complete anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselectivity and a very strong stereochemical bias towards Z&#8208;configured enol ether products. These observations are consistent with a polar mechanism proceeding via a vinyl anion intermediate, and we provide empirical and computation evidence in support of this.

         <title>[3 + 2] Cycloadditions of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Sultams</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 18, May 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable and efficient approach to the synthesis of fused bicyclic and spirocyclic sp3&#8208;enriched sultams via the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition is disclosed. The target cycloadducts are prepared on a multigram scale, and the potential for further functionalization, building block synthesis, and antiviral activity is revealed for selected representatives.







Abstract
A highly efficient multigram synthesis of fused sultams (up to 97&#8197;g in a single run) via the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective [3 + 2] cycloaddition reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated sultams was developed. The scope and limitations of the method were studied by evaluating common 1,3&#8208;dipolar compounds. The reactions with azomethine ylide (obtained from N&#8208;(methoxymethyl)&#8208;N&#8208;(trimethylsilylmethyl)benzylamine), nitrile oxides (generated from chloroximes), and nitrones worked well to give the fused heterocyclic building blocks in a regio&#8208; and diastereoselective manner. In turn, attempted reactions with allenes, azides, and several other 1,3&#8208;dipolar compounds were not fruitful. A series of functional group transformations were applied to obtain fused bicyclic sultam building blocks as promising derivatives for modern drug discovery. In addition to that, antiviral activity was discovered for some representatives of the synthesized bicyclic sultams.

         <title>Cascade Reactions of Enone&#8208;Tethered Ketones and Aldehydes with Indoles: Substrate&#8208;Controlled Divergent Synthesis of Indenes and Indanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 18, May 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diversity&#8208;oriented one&#8208;pot synthesis of indenes and indanes has been realized under benign metal&#8208;free conditions. The Michael&#8211;Aldol cascade process involving reactions of enone&#8208;tethered ketones with indoles to readily access indenes is demonstrated in the presence of iodine as a catalyst. However, a reaction sequence that involves Michael&#8211;Aldol, and nucleophilic substitution gives indanes bearing indole moieties by employing enone&#8208;tethered aldehyde as a reaction partner with indoles.







Abstract
A cascade strategy involving the reactions of enone&#8208;tethered ketones with indoles for the synthesis of indenes is outlined in the presence of iodine as a catalyst. Halogen bonding between molecular iodine and enones activates substrates to undergo Michael addition with indoles, resulting in the formation of enolates. These enolates in&#8197;situ are transformed into indenes via an intramolecular aldol condensation. Enone&#8208;tethered aldehydes, however, react with two molecules of indoles to give indanes through a reaction sequence that involves chemoselective Michael addition followed by intramolecular aldol, and nucleophilic substitution. The substrate&#8208;controlled diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis has been realized to readily access indenes and indanes bearing indole moieties under benign metal&#8208;free conditions. The compatibility of these reactions has also been tested with a scale&#8208;up reaction for practical applications.

&lt;p&gt;A diversity-oriented one-pot synthesis of indenes and indanes has been realized under benign metal-free conditions. The Michael&#8211;Aldol cascade process involving reactions of enone-tethered ketones with indoles to readily access indenes is demonstrated in the presence of iodine as a catalyst. However, a reaction sequence that involves Michael&#8211;Aldol, and nucleophilic substitution gives indanes bearing indole moieties by employing enone-tethered aldehyde as a reaction partner with indoles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cascade strategy involving the reactions of enone-tethered ketones with indoles for the synthesis of indenes is outlined in the presence of iodine as a catalyst. Halogen bonding between molecular iodine and enones activates substrates to undergo Michael addition with indoles, resulting in the formation of enolates. These enolates &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; are transformed into indenes via an intramolecular aldol condensation. Enone-tethered aldehydes, however, react with two molecules of indoles to give indanes through a reaction sequence that involves chemoselective Michael addition followed by intramolecular aldol, and nucleophilic substitution. The substrate-controlled diversity-oriented synthesis has been realized to readily access indenes and indanes bearing indole moieties under benign metal-free conditions. The compatibility of these reactions has also been tested with a scale-up reaction for practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Axially Chiral Naphthalol Benzo&#8208;Quinoline Ligands for the Cu(OTf)2&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Cyclopropanation of &#945;&#8208;Arylidene Diazosuccinimides and Styrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 18, May 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new class of axially chiral arylphenol&#8208;quinoline ligands, synthesized via a scalable Combes quinoline route using NOBIN and H8&#8208;NOBIN. Ligand L1, in combination with Cu(OTf)&#8322;, catalyzed the enantioselective cyclopropanation of &#945;&#8208;arylidene diazosuccinimides and styrenes, yielding chiral spirocyclopropane succinimides with high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities (&#8805;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 er, &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr).







Abstract
A new class of axially chiral arylphenol&#8208;quinoline ligands was designed and prepared from commercially available 2&#8242;&#8208;amino[1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalen]&#8208;2&#8208;ol (NOBIN) and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;5,5&#8242;,6,6&#8242;,7,7&#8242;,8,8&#8242;&#8208;octahydro&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl (H8&#8208;NOBIN). Of these ligands, L1 combined effectively with Cu(OTf)2 to catalyze the cyclopropanation reactions of &#945;&#8208;arylidene diazosuccinimides and styrenes. Consequently, the desired multifunctional products bearing untouched arylidene groups were obtained in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;excellent enantioselectivities (&#8804;96&#8201;:&#8201;4 er) and diastereoselectivities (&#8804;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 dr) with moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields (&#8804;83&#8201;%). After simple recrystallization, the diastereoselectivities and enantioselectivities of the chiral products were considerably improved (&#8805;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 er with &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) in most cases. This approach provides an efficient solution for the preparation of high&#8208;optical&#8208;purity multifunctional &#945;&#8208;arylidene spirocyclopropane succinimides, potentially valuable as chiral synthons and platform molecules which may be transformed into diverse functional chiral molecules by reaction at different functional sites.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Three&#8208;Component Radical Strategy for the Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Amino Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 18, May 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated three&#8208;component radical reaction involving alcohols or alkanes and in&#8197;situ&#8208;formed imines. The imines, generated from aldehydes and amines, serve as key reactants, while the inexpensive and readily available sodium decatungstate (NaDT) is employed as a photocatalyst. This strategy enables the functionalization of industrially accessible alcohols or alkanes to synthesize &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols via an intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The reaction is operationally simple, exhibits high conversion efficiency, facilitates straightforward post&#8208;reaction processing, and demonstrates excellent atom and step economy.

         <title>Modulating Electrochemical and Optical Properties of Oligothiophenes via Subtle Changes in Donnor &#8208; Acceptor Sequence</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 18, May 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligothiophenes varying by their donor&#8208;acceptor sequences and displaying distinct optical and electrochemical properties were synthesized by playing with the different reactivity of &#945; and &#945;&#8217; positions of 3&#8208;hexyloxy&#8208;4&#8208;cyanothiophene.







Abstract
This study explores the synthesis and electronic properties of oligothiophenes derived from the 3&#8208;hexyloxy&#8208;4&#8208;cyanothiophene building block. By exploiting the differential reactivity of thiophene's &#945;&#8208;positions, regioisomeric derivatives were synthesized with varying donor&#8211;acceptor sequences. These derivatives displayed distinct optical and electrochemical characteristics based on the relative positions of cyano acceptor and hexyloxy donor groups. Spectroscopic, computational, and electrochemical analyses revealed that substituent placement critically affects electronic properties, such as HOMO&#8208;LUMO levels and band gaps. The introduction of alkoxy groups at external &#946;&#8208;sites promoted coupling reactions upon oxidation, leading to polymerization or dimerization. Conversely, cyano groups at these positions stabilized radical cations and dications, suppressing further reactions. These findings offer insights into designing conjugated systems with tunable properties, emphasizing the importance of substituent positioning for optimizing performance.

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized Cyclooctynes as Building Blocks for Non&#8208;covalent Surface&#8208;Orthogonal Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 18, May 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various syntheses of cyclooctynes substituted with functional groups capable for hydrogen bonding (amide, imide, carboxylic acid) are reported. These are potential building blocks for surface&#8208;orthogonal molecular architecture on the Si(001) surface.







Abstract
Cyclooctynes substituted with functional groups capable for hydrogen bonding (amide, imide, carboxylic acid) have been synthesized. The 8&#8208;membered ring was derived from cyclooctadiene, by Beckmann rearrangement or by ring&#8208;closing metathesis. The transannular instability of a monocyclic cyclooctyne lactam was postulated. Three stable functionalized cyclooctynes obtained are candidates for a surface&#8208;orthogonal layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer synthesis on semiconductor surfaces (in particular the Si(001) surface).

         <title>Synthesis of Xylo&#8208;nucleoside H&#8208;Phosphinates and Insights into Their Conformational Preferences Within a Chimeric Duplex</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 18, May 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for synthesizing xylo&#8208;nucleoside H&#8208;phosphinate building blocks was developed, and a DNA:XNA:DNA chimeric decamer with a central 2&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;phosphonomethoxy&#8208;linked xylo&#8208;nucleotide was chemically synthesized and analysed. The xylose sugar adopts an N&#8208;type conformation, while the extra methylene group introduces flexibility, disrupting hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions, reducing duplex thermal stability compared to unmodified DNA.







Abstract
An efficient method for the synthesis of xylo&#8208;nucleoside H&#8208;phosphinate building blocks containing both pyrimidine and purine nucleobases is reported. A DNA&#8208;phoXyloNA&#8208;DNA chimeric sequence containing a central 2&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;phosphonomethoxy&#8208;linked xylo&#8208;nucleoside uracil residue was chemically synthesized, and its structural properties were examined using advanced spectroscopic techniques and computational simulations. Results outlined herein suggest that the xylose sugar moiety predominantly favors an N&#8208;type conformation stabilized by intraresidue hydrogen bonding interactions, while the inclusion of an extra methylene group in the backbone introduces significant flexibility within the internucleotide linkage. Within a duplex structure, disrupted hydrogen bonding interactions in the xU5::dA16 base pair, combined with diminished stacking interactions at the site of modification collectively contribute to a reduction in thermal stability compared to the unmodified counterpart. These findings enhance our understanding of the stability and dynamics of orthogonal backbone&#8208;sugar modified nucleic acids (XNAs), aiding in the design of functionally tailored analogues.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Markovnikov Hydration of Unactivated Terminal Alkenes Enabled by Reductive Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 18, May 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we describe a convenient and general method for the Markovnikov oxidation of unactivated olefins to alcohols and ketones using commercially available iron acetylacetonate (Fe(acac)3) as catalysts, and cheap phenylsilane PhSiH3 as reducing agent. All reactions proceed efficiently at room temperature with air as sole oxidant. The alcohols are formed smoothly in up to &gt;80&#8201;% isolated yield and with 100&#8201;% regioselectivity for secondary alcohols formation, while the corresponding ketones were observed as by&#8208;products.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a simple and convenient protocol for the Markovnikov oxidation of unactivated olefins to alcohols and ketones using readily available iron salt Fe(acac)3 as a catalyst, and phenylsilane PhSiH3 as reducing material. All reactions proceed efficiently at mild conditions with air as terminal oxidant. This transformation has been applied to a variety of substrates, and is distinguished by its simplicity, mild temperatures and broad scope. The alcohols are formed smoothly in up to &gt;80&#8201;% isolated yield and with 100&#8201;% regioselectivity for secondary alcohols formation, while the corresponding ketones were observed as by&#8208;products.

Herein, a novel DBU (1,8&#8208;Diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene) mediates the synthesis of quinoxalines from o&#8208;phenylenediamines and sulfoxonium ylides. The method requires no metal catalysts and oxidizers, is economical and environmentally friendly, and has superior functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies have shown that DBU proceeds by inducing reactions through nucleophilic attack on sulfoxonium ylides. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and various cross&#8208;reactions further demonstrate the merits of this strategy.

         <title>Photocarboxylation of Arylated 2H&#8208;Azirines Exploiting Continuous Flow Technology</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 18, May 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient continuous process for the synthesis of trisubstituted oxazoles is reported which links the photochemical opening of azirines and the subsequent trapping of the azomethine ylides with CO2 gas. This highlights challenges and solutions when incorporating CO2 as a feedstock material for the photochemical synthesis of small heterocyclic building blocks.







Abstract
A robust and efficient continuous flow set&#8208;up is presented for the orchestrated use of CO2 gas and photochemistry in flow mode. This study explores the catalyst&#8208;free cycloaddition between azomethine ylides generated in&#8197;situ from simple 2H&#8208;azirines and CO2. Using UV&#8722;A light (365&#8197;nm) as energy source and CO2 as inexpensive and abundant building block provides an attractive strategy affording isomeric oxazolones which were subsequently aromatised to yield novel oxazole products in a convergent manner. Continuous flow processing substantially improves the reaction performance allowing for the safe exploitation of this intriguing transformation. This enables the effective fixation of CO2 to generate valuable building blocks that can be scaled to gram scale with ease.

         <title>User&#8208;friendly and Green Procedure for a Photoinduced Wohl&#8208;Ziegler Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 18, May 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and ecofriendly catalyst&#8208;free allylic and benzylic bromination method using a stoichiometric amount of NBS under LEDs light irradiation is described. This method provides an alternative to the Wohl&#8208;Ziegler procedure which is classically performed in the presence of a radical initiator in the banned solvent CCl4. The method is applicable to a wide range of substrates, is easily scalable and is carried out at room temperature under air atmosphere. No special equipment other than the LEDs lamp is needed.







Abstract
A convenient Wohl&#8208;Ziegler bromination protocol using NBS under visible light in standard laboratory glassware is described. The monobromination reaction is efficient and selective over a wide range of substrates. Unlike previous studies, we prove that the use of a photocatalyst is unnecessary. The proposed protocol is simple to implement and applicable at the gram scale. The reaction takes place in a few tens of minutes at room temperature and offers an alternative to the use of CCl4, which is conventionally used for Wohl&#8208;Ziegler bromination. Alternative conditions of bromination by CBr4 in the presence of a photocatalyst have also been investigated.

         <title>Green Light&#8208;Driven Organophosphine&#8208;Catalyzed Iododifluoroalkylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 18, May 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green light&#8208;driven, organophosphine&#8208;catalysed iododifluoroalkylation of alkynes using iododifluoroketones has been developed without the need for additional base. This reaction demonstrates compatibility with a variety of iododifluoroketones, iododifluoroesters, and perfluoroalkyl iodides to provide a concise and sustainable synthesis of CF2&#8208;derived alkenyl iodides, which could be readily transformed into the corresponding multisubstituted alkenes of great importance in medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
A green light&#8208;driven, organophosphine&#8208;catalyzed iododifluoroalkylation of alkynes using iododifluoroketones has been developed, eliminating the need for additional metal catalysts and bases. This protocol enables the efficient and sustainable synthesis of CF2&#8208;derived alkenyl iodides under mild conditions, demonstrating excellent tolerance to iododifluoroketones, iododifluoroesters, and perfluoroalkyl iodides. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the catalytic phosphine functions not only as a Lewis base, forming a charge&#8208;transfer complex with difluoroalkyl iodides through halogen&#8208;bonding interactions to generate Rf radicals, but also as a halogen transfer shuttle catalyst to facilitate the catalytic cycle.

         <dc:description>
A series of chiral polycyclic 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines were prepared in excellent yields, diastereoselectivities, and enantioselectivities by an asymmetric organocatalytic Michael/hemiketalization/amination process involving 1,3&#8208;diketones and 2,3&#8208;dioxopyrrolidines. The subsequent oxidative aromatization delivered chiral atropisomeric 4&#8208;arylpyridines in moderate to high yields and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
An asymmetric Michael/hemiketalization/amination reaction of 1,3&#8208;diketones with 2,3&#8208;dioxopyrrolidines catalysed by a quinine&#8208;derived urea catalyst has been developed, which furnished a series of chiral polycyclic 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines in satisfactory yields and enantioselectivities (35&#8211;94&#8201;% yield for two steps and up to 99&#8201;% ee). Moreover, the subsequent oxidative aromatization of chiral 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines delivered chiral atropisomeric 4&#8208;arylpyridines in 69&#8211;94&#8201;% yield and up to 95&#8201;% ee.

         <title>Diving into the Shielding Surfaces: Construction of Atropisomeric Axes via Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 18, May 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully designed and synthesized a diverse library of atropisomeric molecular systems using a scaffold hopping strategy based on the GBB&#8208;3CR. Structural and computational analyses revealed key CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, aromatic shielding effects, and conformational dynamics, providing insights into their potential biological relevance.







Abstract
The CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction, characterized by a CH group acting as a hydrogen bond donor and &#960; electrons serving as the acceptor, shares structural similarities with hydrogen bond and plays a significant role in a multitude of molecular systems. However, due to the weak and variable nature of these interactions, they remain poorly understood. Recently, we reported the design of high rotational barrier atropisomeric systems incorporating CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. Building on these insights, we explored the Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienaym&#233; three&#8208;component reaction (GBB&#8208;3CR) to access additional atropisomeric systems. We hypothesized that the GBB&#8208;derived scaffold could serve as a modular platform, facilitating the strategic incorporation of CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions to enhance structural diversity and functionality. Using 2&#8208;aminopyridine, polyaromatic aldehydes and ortho&#8208;substituted phenyl isocyanides, we systematically explored the substrate scope. We investigated the impact of different shelves and arms, emphasizing the effect of aromatic ring topology and number on molecular conformations and ring currents. To analyze experimental NMR signals of methyl groups, we calculated the chemical shifts and estimated the ring current contributions. The through&#8208;space NMR shielding calculations and isochemical shielding surface (ICSS) visualizations provided insights into the electronic environments within the scaffold, advancing our understanding of CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions and their potential applications.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 18, May 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of the recent advances on the selective C(sp2)&#8208; and C(sp3)&#8722;H chalcogenation of &#945;&#8208;amino acids and peptides using various chalcogenides has been demonstrated. As a result, the evolved methodologies, encompassing transition&#8208;metal, metal&#8208;free, and photocatalytic protocols, exhibit superior efficiency compared to conventional chalcogenation methods.







Abstract
Natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids are building blocks of biomacromolecules proteins and peptides, which are essential for living organisms. Recently, structurally modified amino acids and their peptides have received high demand for the development of various types of biomaterials, including therapeutic drug candidates. For example, the chalcogenated amino acids and their peptides serve as privileged structural scaffolds, derived from native amino acids. Given the widespread utility of sulfur/selenium&#8208;containing compounds in biological, pharmaceutical, and medicinal chemistry, efficient chalcogenation protocol has been accomplished through various catalytic methods such as transition&#8208;metal, metal&#8208;free, and photocatalytic strategies. Among them, transition&#8208;metal based strategies through C&#8722;H activation have been extensively explored for the chalcogenation of amino acids and peptides. Concurrently, metal&#8208;free and photocatalytic strategies offer sustainable and step&#8208;economically viable pathways for achieving successful chalcogenation. In this review, we have focused on the recent achievements of both C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;H chalcogenation of &#945;&#8208;amino acids and peptides with chalcogenides along with their substrate scopes, mechanisms, advantages, and limitations.

         <title>Advancements in the Synthesis of Oxadiazines, Mechanistic insights and Pathways</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 18, May 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the synthesis and mechanistic pathways of oxadiazines, highlighting their significance in organic synthesis, pharmaceuticals, and industry. Recent advancements in metal&#8208;catalyzed, organocatalytic, and green approaches are examined, along with key strategies such as cycloaddition and oxidative annulation, etc. Mechanistic insights into intermediates, transition states, and catalyst roles are discussed to refine synthetic pathways and enhance efficiency.







Abstract
Oxadiazine has the distinctive structure of a six&#8208;membered heterocyclic ring with two nitrogen and one oxygen atoms. This molecule has lately gained substantial attention due to its promising uses in several sectors, including medicines, agrochemicals, and material science. As a result, the synthesis of oxadiazine is extensively explored for its application in pharmaceuticals, pest control, and medical treatments due to its antibacterial, anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory and insecticidal effects. In this review, we provided a comprehensive overview of oxadiazine&#8216;s synthetic strategies and mechanistic aspects, prioritizing the various novel methods developed for synthesising oxadiazine. We demonstrated the synthesis of various oxadiazine derivatives such as 1,3,4&#8208;, 1,3,5&#8208;, 1,2,4&#8208;, 1,2,5&#8208;oxadiazines and the functionalization of this molecule to enhance their bioactivity. In this study, we discussed an overview of synthetic routes, such as cyclization reactions, cycloaddition reactions, catalyst&#8208;free and solvent&#8208;free reactions, triflate&#8208;catalyzed reactions, etc. We highlighted the challenges faced in the reported synthesis, suitable reaction conditions, substrate scope and applications.

Pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalines and pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalin&#8208;4(5H)&#8208;ones have garnered significant research interest due to their diverse biological activities and potential pharmaceutical applications. This review systematically summarizes the latest synthesis methods for constructing pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalines and pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalin&#8208;4(5H)&#8208;ones, categorized by starting materials, including those from nitrobenzenes, azides, benzimidazoles, and others.







Abstract
Pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalines and pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalin&#8208;4(5H)&#8208;ones are recognized as important tricyclic scaffolds due to their diverse pharmacological activities, including anticancer, anti&#8208;fungi, anti&#8208;tuberculosis, and antimalarial, as well as their roles as 5&#8208;HT3 receptor agonists and kinase inhibitors targeting CK2 and AKT, and others. Developing efficient and reliable synthetic approaches to access these compounds remains an attractive goal in contemporary medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. This review highlights recent advances in the synthesis of pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalines and pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalin&#8208;4(5H)&#8208;ones, particularly focusing on strategies that maintain the A and C&#8208;rings while constructing the B&#8208;ring through the formation of a&#8208;, b&#8208;, and c&#8208;bonds. The information collected describes the two key components of the synthesis process 1&#8208;(2&#8208;Substitued&#8208;phenyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole and aldehyde or its surrogate. This review also briefly summarizes the reaction mechanisms for the formation of tricyclic skeletons to determine the key factors governing the issues of productivity and regioselectivity. Through analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of existing synthetic methods, we predict that A&#8208;ring formation strategy&#8208;based pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxaline reactions will be developed in the future. We hope that this review will motivate the search for novel strategies to synthesize pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalines and pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalin&#8208;4(5H)&#8208;ones, accessing tricyclic skeletons that may have potential applications in medicinal chemistry, materials science, and many branches of chemistry.

         <title>Recent Advances of Enaminones in Multi&#8208;component Reactions: A Brief Review</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 18, May 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enaminones as the valuable and versatile synthons are widely used in organic synthesis, particularly in the form of multicomponent reactions. This review describes recent advances in enaminones involved multi&#8208;component reactions (MCRs). Commonly synthetic strategies, reaction conditions, substrate scopes, reaction features, and the proposed mechanisms of each cited paper were nearly all discussed, and their future outlook is also prospected.







Abstract
As we know, multicomponent reactions have emerged as powerful tools in organic synthesis due to their high atom and step economy, eco&#8208;friendly, diversity, convenience, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, and have broad application prospects in many fields such as drug synthesis, material science and natural product synthesis. On the other side, enaminones, which contain amine&#8208;alkene&#8208;carbonyl conjugated structure possessing multiple reactive sites, have extensively served as versatile building blocks for the construction of diverse organic molecules. In this review, we describe recent advances in enaminones involved multi&#8208;component reactions (MCRs). Commonly synthetic strategies, reaction conditions, substrate scopes, reaction features, and the proposed mechanisms of each cited paper were nearly all discussed, and their future outlook is also prospected.

         <title>Streamlining Vorinostat Synthesis: A Chemoenzymatic Continuous Flow Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoenzymatic protocol for the synthesis of histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat has been established. Immobilized lipase from C. antarctica (imm&#8208;CaLB) allowed the functionalization of suberanoyl acid 1 and further conversion to vorinostat via ion&#8208;exchange resin treatment. The continuous flow system affords vorinostat in high yield, avoiding chromatographic purifications, shortening the reaction time and minimizing solvent usage and waste production.

Anticancer agent vorinostat is one of the only three commercialized histone deacetylase inhibitors approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of cutaneous T&#8208;cell lymphoma. Several synthetic pathways and only one biocatalytic approach have been designed over the years. However, no chemoenzymatic approaches have been described to date. Herein, the first two&#8208;step protocol for the obtainment of vorinostat is presented, which combines the chemical acylation of aniline followed by the lipase&#8208;catalyzed (immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica) condensation and the final hydrolysis with an acidic resin. Initially, batch studies allow to obtain vorinostat in high yield (70%) in 16&#8201;h using eco&#8208;friendly t&#8208;amyl alcohol as the reaction medium. Subsequently, the protocol is transferred to a continuous flow reactor, which reduces the overall time to 4&#8201;h while keeping the same final yield. Furthermore, the developed procedure minimizes solvent waste and enhances system automation, paving the way for a feasible application to further hydroxamic acid moieties of pharmaceutical interest.

Furthermore, the developed procedure minimizes solvent waste and enhances system automation, paving the way for a feasible application to further hydroxamic acid moieties of pharmaceutical interest.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoinduced Copper&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Arylation Reaction of N&#63743;H Heteroarenes Using Aryl Thianthrenium Salts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted copper&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;arylation protocol is described that enables direct C&#63743;N bond construction between N&#63743;H heteroarenes and arenes by the use of aryl thianthrenium salts. This photoactivation strategy demonstrates extensive substrate scope and offers a means to retain an activated functional group (such as Br, CHO, and CN) for subsequent derivatization reactions.

Herein, an efficient photoinduced copper&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;arylation reaction is presented, which occurs through the cross&#8208;coupling of N&#63743;H heteroarenes with aryl thianthrenium salts (Ar&#8208;TTs). This photoactivation strategy exhibits broad substrate scope and offers a method for preserving activated functional groups (such as Br, CHO, and CN) for subsequent derivatization reactions.

Fluorescent Bis&#8208;Dihydropyridine Hybrids: Design, Synthesis, and Redox Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, photophysical, and electrochemical properties of hybrid derivatives of nonsymmetrical bis&#8208;dihydropyridines are described. These compounds are obtained by multicomponent Hantzsch ester synthesis followed by a click reaction. Interestingly, photophysical and electrochemical properties of this class of compounds will allow them to be considered for potential applications in biological processes and their potential antioxidant activity.

A set of eight fluorescent symmetric and nonsymmetric bis&#8208;dihydropyridine hybrid molecules (DHP&#8211;DHP) are designed and synthesized through the sequential multicomponent Hantzsch ester synthesis followed by the azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition reaction methodology with the formation of a nonenolizable triazole linker between the two dihydropyridine portions. The luminescence properties are evaluated by absorption and fluorescence emission (steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved) techniques, aided by density functional theory calculations. The redox properties of this new series of DHP derivatives are also evaluated.

         <title>NNN Palladium(II)Pincer Complex in a Borrowing Hydrogen Process: Alkylation of Indoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NNN&#8211;Pd(II) pincer complex is utilized in the selective synthesis of C3&#8208;alkylated indoles as well as the synthesis of bis(indolyl)methanes by tuning the reaction conditions using the same substrates. The control experiments and quantum chemical analysis suggest that C3 functionalization of indole involves a &#8220;borrowing hydrogen process.&#8221;

Recently, an azine NNN&#8211;Pd(II) nonpalindromic pincer complex is generated, and its application in acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling is explored. This article establishes the application of the same pincer complex in the borrowing hydrogen process (BHP). Herein, the selective synthesis of C3 alkylated indoles (CAIs) is reported. Remarkably, this catalyst enables the synthesis of bis(indolyl)methanes (BIMs) by tuning the reaction conditions using the same substrates. The control experiments and quantum chemical analysis suggest that C3 functionalization of indole involves BHP. The formation of BIMs is an additional advantage.

The reactions proceeded under mild thermal conditions, providing a wide range of functionalized 2&#8208;fluorobenzamides in 65&#8208;80% yields. On the other hand, the reaction proceeds with 58&#8208;63% yields at room temperature under visible&#8208;light Blue LED conditions. Simple operation, metal&#8208;free conditions, and broad substrate scope are the benefits of the developed methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Fluorination of Proline Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of a fluorine into aliphatic substituents of lead candidates can impart unique structural characteristics that allow fine tuning of drug interactions; therefore, mild, specific or late&#8208;stage fluorination procedures are of growing interest in medicinal chemistry, with the potential to be applied in F&#8208;18 radiochemistry. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of &#8220;reagent&#8208;less&#8221; electrochemical fluorination leading to mono&#8208; and gem&#8208;difluorinated proline cores featured in important fibroblast&#8208;activating protein inhibitors. Our study highlights the importance of using the appropriate activator substituents for allowing the process, the impact of different reaction parameters, and characterizes the various byproducts that are generated in the reaction. We have tested the reaction using a commercially available batch system and flow apparatus, achieving maximum yields of &gt;90% (batch) for mono&#8208; and of 6% (batch) and 9% (flow) for the gem&#8208;difluorinated proline model. These proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept results indicate that the flow approach is more efficient, but that different activating substituents will be needed to achieve higher yields</dc:description>

Reactions of aromatic compounds with diiodoperfluoroalkanes are investigated, and it is found that different products can be synthesized depending on the reaction conditions and amounts of reagents. In particular, the reaction of 1,4&#8208;diiodoperfluorobutane under UV irradiation provides unique cyclic perfluoroalkyl aromatic compounds.

Both UV&#8208;light&#8208;promoted and organic&#8208;dye&#8208;catalyzed visible light&#8208;promoted reactions of diiodoperfluoroalkanes with an iodine substituent at both ends and substituted anilines are attempted. In the reactions with 1,6&#8208; and 1,8&#8208;diiodoperfluoroalkanes in the presence of an excess amount of aniline, both ends of the iodide reacts to give a diamine, and the reaction with an excess amount of diiodide gives a monoiodide, in which one end of the diiodide has reacted with the aniline. In contrast, in the case of the 1,4&#8208;diiodoperfluoroalkane, the UV reaction yields cyclization products in which both ends of the diiodine has reacted with the same aromatic ring, while the visible light reaction yields products in which only one end has reacted. Since synthetic examples of such cyclization products are limited, the reaction with various aromatic compounds is tried and it has been shown that it is effective for electron&#8208;rich aromatic rings. The mechanism of these reactions is discussed and the importance of the redox potential of the iodides is pointed out.

         <title>Synthesis of a Selena&#8208;Hybrid [5]Radialene Derivative and Exploration of Polycyclic Heteroterphenoquinones as Ambipolar Charge Carriers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>para&#8208;Terphenoquinone (pTPQ) in which a benzenoid ring has been replaced with a heterocycle is known as heteroterphenoquinone (HTPQ). While (H)TPQs are typically non&#8208;emissive and potentially open&#8208;shell species, we recently reported that fully fused polycyclic HTPQs (or PHTPQs) bearing a sulfur heteroatom could either exhibit fluorescence or antiaromaticity depending on the &#960;&#8208;conjugation arrangement in the core. Since the synthesis of PHTPQs is rare, until now limited to our own reported compound containing a sulfur atom, we have now synthesized a selenium&#8208;containing fluorescent PHTPQ while attempting the isolation of elusive dinaphthodicyclopenta[b,d]selenophene. The fluorescent PHTPQ was further dehydrogenated to synthesize the first PHTPQ with an embedded selenophenoradialene (selena&#8208;hybrid [5]radialene), which was found to exhibit antiaromatic properties. The narrow optical HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap, short intermolecular interactions in the solid state, and redox amphoterism prompted us to explore its ambipolar charge transport properties alongside the thia&#8208;analogue. The electron mobilities for PHTPQs comprising selenaradialene (1.96 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2&#8202;&#183;&#8202;V&#8722;1&#8202;&#183;&#8202;s&#8722;1) and thiaradialene (1.58 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2&#8202;&#183;&#8202;V&#8722;1&#8202;&#183;&#8202;s&#8722;1) cores were found to be one order of magnitude higher than that of the holes due to low&#8208;lying LUMO energy levels.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Multicomponent Reactions for the Synthesis of Diverse Heterocyclic Frameworks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review reports the state of the art of light&#8208;promoted reactions (blue, white, and green light), published in last five years (2021 up until the current date), in which either photocatalyst or no photocatalyst are required for the effective synthesis of divergent heterocyclic scaffolds under visible catalysis via multicomponent reactions.

The characteristics of visible light, including its sustainability, eco&#8208;friendliness, and potential for renewable energy, have made visible light&#8208;powered catalysis an intriguing research topic of great interest. In this case, photoredox catalysis uses a single&#8208;electron transfer mechanism under mild reaction conditions to produce very reactive radical species with frequently unusual reactivities. This work is the most comprehensive review of photochemical methods for producing divergent heterocycles through multicomponent reactions, covering important developments since 2021. This review is structured according to the kind of synthesized heterocyclic scaffold. Additionally, different study findings&#8217; scopes, limitations, and mechanistic studies are covered.

         <title>Recent Advances in Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Sulfinyl Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in catalytic preparation of chiral sulfinyl compounds via transition&#8208;metal&#8208;, organo&#8208;, and biocatalysis are summarized. This review comprises applications in catalytic asymmetric synthesis of various types of enantiopure sulfinyl derivatives (including sulfoxides, sulfinate esters, sulfinamides, and sulfoximines) and is arranged according to the catalytic types.

Chiral sulfinyl architectures have emerged as one of most important structural motifs in modern drug and agrochemical discovery due to their unique physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. They are also recognized as versatile platforms for novel chiral ligands, organocatalysts, and auxiliaries in asymmetric synthesis. Benefitting from the development of transition metal catalysis, organocatalysis, and biocatalysis technologies in recent years, attention has exploited to new tactics for the asymmetric construction of chiral sulfinyl compounds and their derivatives. This review highlights the advances in the field of catalytic preparation of enantiopure sulfinyl derivatives (including sulfoxides, sulfinate esters, sulfinamides, and sulfoximines) since 2020, with an emphasis on the substrate scope, mechanistic aspect, unmet challenges, and future opportunities.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Convertible Groups to Expand the Substrate Scope for Pentafluorosulfanylation of Styrenes by Photocatalytic Activation of Sulfur Hexafluoride</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalytic activation of sulfur hexafluoride, SF6, is an important synthetic method to access pentafluorosulfanylated organic compounds because of the non&#8208;toxic properties of this gas. However, the redox properties of the organic substrates must fit to the photoredox cycle for the activation of SF6. Strong electron&#8208;donating groups turned &#945;&#8208;phenyl styrenes into a redox&#8208;inactive state. These substrates had to be converted into redox&#8208;active derivatives by reversible modifications of the critical substituents. This concept of redox&#8208;convertible substituents has been successfully applied to expand the substrate scope for the pentafluorosulfanylation of &#945;&#8208;phenyl and &#945;&#8208;methyl styrenes by using SF6.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carboxylation using stable and abundant CO2 as a carbon source would be an attractive option in synthetic organic chemistry if the use of highly reactive organometals or toxic and expensive transition metals can be avoided. Herein we report a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free direct carboxylation of aryl trialkoxyboronates in supercritical CO2 (scCO2), promoted by a catalytic amount of ZnO. The use of cage&#8208;shaped trialkoxyboronates, which are both nucleophilic and soluble in scCO2, is the key to this reaction. DFT calculations indicate that the high pressure and high temperature of scCO2 with the ZnO catalyst compensate for the high activation energy of direct carboxylation of the boronates.</dc:description>

         <title>Amino&#8208;acid&#8208;encoded enantioselective photocatalysis in self&#8208;assembled porphyrin&#8208;amino acid derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphyrin&#8208;based nanomaterials have attracted much attention in photocatalysis due to their excellent photo&#8208;electrocatalytic ability and strong intermolecular interaction forces. In this study, a series of chiral assemblies of porphyrin&#8208;amino acid derivatives were prepared by linking different types of amino acids with terminal modifications to tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin via covalent bonding and their catalytic ability in enantioselective photocatalytic oxidation of tyrosine was investigated. The results show that the amino acid type and terminal groups significantly affect the macroscopic assembly morphology and microscopic chiral space of the porphyrin&#8208;amino acid derivatives, which is consistent with the results of molecular dynamics simulations and further impacts on the rate and enantioselectivity of tyrosine chiral photocatalytic oxidation. These results provide new avenues for applying porphyrin derivatives in chiral photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Rhamnose&#8208;Modified Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;Containing Saponins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of triterpenoid saponins bearing a Lewis&#8208;X trisaccharide analogue, in which the fucose residue is replaced by a rhamnose, is presented. These saponins, designed as negative controls in dendritic cell&#8208;specific intercellular adhesion molecule&#8208;3&#8208;grabbing nonintegrin&#8208;targeted therapeutic applications, are prepared through iterative and convergent glycosylation strategies, achieving good overall yields and complete control over stereoselectivity.

The synthesis of betulinic acid and echinocystic acid saponins featuring an unnatural analogue of the Lewis&#8208;X trisaccharide, in which the l&#8208;fucose residue is replaced by l&#8208;rhamnose, is reported. These triterpenoid saponins are designed as negative controls for dendritic cell&#8208;specific intercellular adhesion molecule&#8208;3&#8208;grabbing nonintegrin&#8208;targeted antiviral and immunological studies. The target saponins are synthesized using both iterative and convergent strategies, requiring nine and six steps, respectively, for the longest linear sequence starting from allyl betulinate and allyl echinocystate. Glycosylation reactions are performed using trihalogenoacetimidate and thioglycoside donors, which provide excellent yields and complete control over stereoselectivity. This work establishes a robust foundation for the synthesis of lupane&#8208; and oleanane&#8208;type triterpenoid saponins incorporating Lewis&#8208;X trisaccharide analogues.

Para&#8208;Toluenesulfonic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Green Synthesis of Pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines from 5&#8208;Aminopyrazoles and Terminal Keto&#8208;Alkynes</title>

         <dc:description>
A green and efficient protocol is developed for the synthesis of pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines via para&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid&#8208;catalyzed tandem Michael addition and cyclization of 5&#8208;aminopyrazoles with terminal keto&#8208;alkynes in ethanol at room temperature. The method offers high yields, NMR&#8208;pure products without chromatography, and scalability, as demonstrated in the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of a bioactive tubulin polymerization inhibitor.

A simple and effective approach has been established for the synthesis of novel multi&#8208;substituted pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidine derivatives utilizing 5&#8208;amino&#8208;pyrazoles and terminal keto&#8208;alkynes as starting materials. This method achieves excellent yields under catalytic acidic conditions in environmentally benign solvents (water/ethanol) at ambient temperature. Moreover, this protocol affords NMR pure products through a simple filtration process. Additionally, the synthetic utility is validated through a gram&#8208;scale synthesis of the biologically active tubulin inhibitor, 6. Thereby emphasizing the pivotal role of chemistry in designing and producing potent anticancer molecules for therapeutic use.

         <title>Green&#8208;Light Cerium Photocatalysis Enabled by Pyridine N&#8208;Oxide Ligands</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridine N&#8208;oxides are found to be hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer ligands in cerium photocatalysis. Compared to previous described systems, the corresponding photoactive cerium(IV)&#8208;complex exhibits a distinct bathochromic shift, which enables the CH&#8208;hydrazination of small molecules with green light.

Pyridine N&#8208;oxides are reported as neutral ligands in cerium photocatalysis. By using those neutral ligands, photoactive Ce(IV)&#8208;species are generated, which show an extensive bathochromic shift compared to previously employed cerium&#8208;based complexes. This allows the effective utilization of green light in the redox&#8208;neutral CH&#8208;hydrazination of small molecules under very mild photocatalytic conditions.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NHC&#8208;catalyzed radical ring opening of bicyclobutanes with readily accessible aldehydes and Togni I regents to afford 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetrasubstituted CF3&#8208;containing cyclobutanes is developed, which exhibits exclusive regioselectivity and up to excellent diastereoselectivity under mild conditions.

Herein, the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed ring opening of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) with aldehydes and Togni I reagents through a three&#8208;component radical relay process is reported, which affords 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetrasubstituted cyclobutanes. This reaction exhibits exclusive regioselectivity and up to excellent diastereoselectivity under mild and operating&#8208;simple conditions. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and several product derivatizations demonstrate their potential utilities as versatile building blocks in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Synthesis of Soluble Nickel&#8211;Salphen Ligand Complexes as Near&#8208;Infrared Dyes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five soluble nickel&#8208;salphen&#8208;type near&#8208;infrared dyes are synthesized by expanding the conjugation and introducing substituent groups. After the introduction of thiophene and electron&#8208;withdrawing terminal groups, these complexes exhibit a red shift in absorption, along with enhanced solubility in polar solvents and superior photothermal stability.

Salphen metal complexes have the advantages of simple synthesis, high stability, and excellent optical properties. However, their poor solubility, severe aggregation, and short absorption wavelengths limit their application as near&#8208;infrared dyes. In this study, five soluble Ni&#8211;salphen complexes with strong NIR absorption are synthesized by introducing alkyl chains and extending conjugated cores. The results show that the introduction of thiophene and electron&#8208;withdrawing end&#8208;groups has resulted in the red&#8208;shifted absorption of these complexes, with the absorption edge reaching 800&#8201;nm. These compounds have well solubility in organic solvents, more soluble than 8&#8201;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1 in chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, etc. The target molecules also have excellent photostability and thermal stability (Td&#8201;&gt;&#8201;325 &#176;C).

&lt;p&gt;Five soluble nickel-salphen-type near-infrared dyes are synthesized by expanding the conjugation and introducing substituent groups. After the introduction of thiophene and electron-withdrawing terminal groups, these complexes exhibit a red shift in absorption, along with enhanced solubility in polar solvents and superior photothermal stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salphen metal complexes have the advantages of simple synthesis, high stability, and excellent optical properties. However, their poor solubility, severe aggregation, and short absorption wavelengths limit their application as near-infrared dyes. In this study, five soluble Ni&#8211;salphen complexes with strong NIR absorption are synthesized by introducing alkyl chains and extending conjugated cores. The results show that the introduction of thiophene and electron-withdrawing end-groups has resulted in the red-shifted absorption of these complexes, with the absorption edge reaching 800&#8201;nm. These compounds have well solubility in organic solvents, more soluble than 8&#8201;mg&#8201;mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, etc. The target molecules also have excellent photostability and thermal stability (T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&amp;gt;&#8201;325 &#176;C).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Base&#8208;Promoted Solvent&#8208;Tuned Annulation: A Route to Sulfonylated Isochromenes from Sulfonyl Enynals</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Base mediated 1,2&#8208;addition/oxa&#8208;Michael reaction sequence for the synthesis of sulfonylated isochromene is developed. The role of solvent is found to be crucial for the transformation. The method is extrapolated for the naphthalene and isocoumarine synthesis.

A base&#8208;promoted annulation via 1,2&#8208;addition/alkyne&#8208;allene isomerization/oxa&#8208;Michael cyclization of sulfonyl enynals for the synthesis of sulfonylated isochromene is developed. The choice of solvent plays a crucial role in this transformation to give the sulfonylated iscohromenes. The reaction mechanism is supported by the react&#8208;IR experiment. To emphasize the practical utility, the sulfonylated isochromene is deftly elaborated into diversely substituted naphthalene and isocoumarine.

         <title>Divergent Total Syntheses of 7,20&#8208;Epoxy, 3,20&#8208;Epoxy, and 6,7&#8208;seco&#8208;ent&#8208;Kaurane Diterpenoids</title>

         <dc:description>
A concise and versatile synthesis of 7,20&#8208;epoxy&#8208;ent&#8208;kaurane diterpenoids is developed and its tetracyclic core is converted divergently to the skeletons of 3,20&#8208;epoxy and 6,7&#8208;seco&#8208;ent&#8208;kaurane diterpenoids via a bioinspired strategy. Collectively nine total syntheses are achieved.

The genus Isodon is a well&#8208;known traditional medicinal herb that serves as a rich source of cytotoxic ent&#8208;kaurane diterpenoids, which bear the same tetracyclic core of ent&#8208;kaurane with different oxygenation, bond&#8208;cleavage, and rearrangement patterns. The 7,20&#8208;epoxy&#8208;ent&#8208;kaurane diterpenoids are the most studied subclasses, which show promising anticancer activities. Moreover, they also have the potential for transforming to other subclasses of ent&#8208;kaurane diterpenoids. Herein, the details of this study on developing a highly diastereoselective synthetic strategy for the 7,20&#8208;epoxy&#8208;ent&#8208;kaurane diterpenoid (5 natural products) and its conversion to the 3,20&#8208;epoxy (2 natural products) and 6,7&#8208;seco derivatives (2 natural products) are reported. The synthetic strategy features a thermal Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition for the construction of the AB ring system, an intramolecular Mukaiyama Michael/carbocyclization cascade reaction for establishing the CD ring system, a site&#8208;stereoselective oxidation/reduction strategy for completion of the total syntheses of several representative 7,20&#8208;epoxy&#8208;ent&#8208;kaurane diterpenoids, and the divergent syntheses of Isodon diterpenoids in the 3,20&#8208;epoxy and 6,7&#8208;seco subclasses via bioinspired strategies.

         <dc:description>This study describes the utility of p&#8208;acetoxybenzyl carbonate (ABC) group for the protection of hydroxyl functions. This hydroxyl protecting group can be easily prepared using inexpensive commercially available 4&#8208;hydroxybenzyl alcohol as the starting material. The ABC group can be selectively removed through ytterbium(III) triflate&#8208;catalyzed transesterification at room temperature without affecting commonly used acid&#8208;cleavable protecting groups, such as tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS), p&#8208;methoxybenzyl (PMB), acetonide, and benzylidenes.

         <dc:description>Geminal diol (gem&#8208;diol) moieties commonly exist in equilibrium with ketones or aldehydes when water is present in the system. While significant progress has been made in their structural characterization, recent studies have increasingly focused on the reactivity of gem&#8208;diol intermediates. In parallel, gem&#8208;diol&#8208;type hydroxyl&#8208;oxoammonium species have been reported as key intermediates in various reactions. Accordingly, this concept highlights recent advances in the structural elucidation of gem&#8208;diol&#8208;type intermediates and, more importantly, discusses their reactivity and potential application in organic reactions. In addition to typical gem&#8208;diol species, the discussion also encompasses other gem&#8208;diol&#8208;type species with O&#8211;C(sp3)&#8211;O or O&#8211;N(sp3)&#8211;O centers derived from C(sp2)=O or N(sp2)=O centers, respectively. The ultimate aim is to inspire the development of more efficient strategies for employing such gem&#8208;diol&#8208;type intermediates in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Multideuteration of (Hetero)Arenes via Hydrogen Isotope Exchange</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deuteration has gained a prominent role as a powerful method for investigating kinetic isotope effects in chemical reactions. Recent studies show that deuteration can significantly alter the pharmacokinetic and toxicological profiles of drug molecules, thereby enhancing their therapeutic efficacy. As a result, deuteration is being increasingly integrated into pharmaceutical development. At the same time, introducing deuterium into organic electronic materials helps to reduce high&#8208;frequency molecular vibrations, thus broadening the range of applications of organic materials, traditionally dominated by inorganic components.
Since the approval of the deuterated drug deutetrabenazine in 2017 and the commercialization of deuterated emissive materials for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, multideuteration technologies have advanced considerably. Various strategies utilizing both rare and earth&#8208;abundant metals to achieve efficient multideuteration have been reported. This review examines recently developed metal catalysts for multiple deuteration, discusses current challenges in deuteration methods, and explores future opportunities in this rapidly evolving field.</dc:description>

At the same time, introducing deuterium into organic electronic materials helps to reduce high-frequency molecular vibrations, thus broadening the range of applications of organic materials, traditionally dominated by inorganic components.
Since the approval of the deuterated drug deutetrabenazine in 2017 and the commercialization of deuterated emissive materials for organic light-emitting diodes, multideuteration technologies have advanced considerably. Various strategies utilizing both rare and earth-abundant metals to achieve efficient multideuteration have been reported. This review examines recently developed metal catalysts for multiple deuteration, discusses current challenges in deuteration methods, and explores future opportunities in this rapidly evolving field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>C&#63743;H Functionalization and Cyclization Reactions Using Hypervalent Iodine Reagents: A Review on Synthetic Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hypervalent iodine reagents (HIRs) are organoiodine compounds with iodine in +3 or +5 oxidation states. They mimic transition metals in oxidative reactions but are greener, easier to handle, and highly selective. HIRs are versatile tools widely used in oxidation, functional group transfer, cyclisation, and bond formation, offering sustainable and efficient options in synthetic organic chemistry.

Using hypervalent iodine reagents as a mediator or catalyst in C&#63743;H functionalization and cyclization reactions has emerged as a powerful strategy in organic synthesis. This review exhaustively probes the recent advancements in this field, focusing on copious reactions enabled by hypervalent iodine (III/V) reagents. The versatility of iodine as a promoter in numerous transformations, including C&#63743;H activation, functionalization, and cyclization processes is highlighted. The general mechanistic pathway of iodine in mediating these transformations, along with the underlying principles governing the selectivity and reactivity of these transformation processes, is discussed. Furthermore, reactions leading to the synthetic utility and applicability of iodine&#8208;catalyzed/promoted C&#63743;H functionalization and cyclization reactions in synthesizing complex natural products and biologically active molecules are showcased. Overall, this review provides valuable insight for researchers and pharmacists interested in harnessing the potential of hypervalent iodine in developing sustainable and efficacious synthetic methodologies.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Selective Desulfurization of Thioamides in Water and an Open System</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel protocol of selective desulfurization of thioamides to amines with dimethylaminoborane (DMAB) without catalysts, operating in neat water under an open system, is studied.

The selective reduction of the unsaturated substrates in green solvent is highly desired yet however, remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Especially the selective desulfurization of thioamides usually requires hazardous highly reactive reagents or transition metal catalysts in high&#8208;pressure conditions. Herein, a novel protocol of selective desulfurization of thioamides to amines with dimethylaminoborane (DMAB) without catalysts, operating in neat water under an open system, is presented. Notably, the selectivity of the reaction is effectively controlled with a simple Lewis acid additive through computational design. The combination of density functional theory and experimental mechanism studies reveals the important synergistic cooperation by DMAB and Lewis acid additive to facilitate the hydrogenative desulfurization process in an aqueous solution.

         <title>Synthesis of a Library of Bifunctional N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligand Precursors with Hydrogen Bond Donor Subunits</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward two&#8208;step synthesis to bifunctional precursors of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) is developed. Based on this, a library of imidazolium&#8208;based NHCs, with a variety of hydrogen bond donor groups in the backbone is prepared. The utility of the bifunctional NHC ligands is demonstrated in transition metal catalysis with the resulting palladium(II) and copper(I) complexes.

Bifunctional N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) with additional hydrogen bond donor groups in the backbone are important organocatalysts and ligands for transition metal complexes. Herein, a straightforward synthetic approach to a library of bifunctional imidazolium salts, precursors for the respective NHCs with amidine, squaramide, and (thio)urea moieties as hydrogen bond donors, is reported. The preparation of bifunctional palladium(II) and copper(I) NHC complexes and their application in catalysis is presented.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Induced Trifluoromethylation of (Hetero)Arenes by Using SF6 as an Oxidant</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light&#8208;driven trifluoromethylation protocol using SF6 as an oxidant has been developed. This method achieves regioselective C(sp2)&#8211;CF3 bond formation under mild conditions with Rose Bengal catalyst, blue LEDs and bench&#8208;stable CF3SO2Na. The reaction affords moderate to excellent yields across various (hetero)arenes, which facilitates the efficient utilization and degradation of the potent greenhouse gas SF6.

As a potent greenhouse gas, SF6 remains an underexplored oxidant despite its strong electronegativity. In this work, a visible light&#8208;driven trifluoromethylation protocol using SF6 as an oxidant has been developed. This method achieves regioselective C(sp2)&#8211;CF3 bond formation under mild conditions with Rose Bengal catalyst, blue LEDs and bench&#8208;stable CF3SO2Na, facilitating efficient utilization and degradation of the greenhouse gas SF6.

         <title>Bis&#8208;Tetrasubstituted Centers Forming Formal [3+3] Cycloaddition Reaction via Bifunctional Organocatalysis: Synthesis of Spiro&#8208;Oxindoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient method has been developed for Michael/Electrophilic substitution cascade reaction between 3&#8208;pyrrolyl&#8208;oxindoles and unsaturated ketoesters, utilizing bifunctional organocatalysis. This approach enables the synthesis of a diverse array of spiro&#8208;oxindole derivatives bearing three stereogenic centers, two of them quaternary, achieving high yields and exceptional diastereoselectivities. Furthermore, the resulting products can be readily converted into tetrahydropyridine skeletons through an elimination process in one&#8208;pot. This strategy, in conjunction with traditional metal&#8208;catalysis, facilitates the switchable, chemodivergent synthesis of spiro&#8208;oxindoles, offering significant synthetic flexibility and potential for broader applications.</dc:description>

This strategy, in conjunction with traditional metal-catalysis, facilitates the switchable, chemodivergent synthesis of spiro-oxindoles, offering significant synthetic flexibility and potential for broader applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;Pyridone is a crucial building block in bioactive natural products and serves as a vital intermediate for the synthesis of bioactive nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. Recent advancements in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization have enabled the direct modification of 2&#8208;pyridones, circumventing the need for pre&#8208;functionalization. In this study, we report a Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed, C6&#8208;selective C&#8211;H heteroarylation of 2&#8208;pyridones using cyclic iodonium ylides as carbene precursors. The versatility and broad applicability of this method are demonstrated through the efficient synthesis of diverse compounds featuring both 2&#8208;pyridone&#8208;pyridine and cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Determination and Characterization of Electronic Properties of Photosilylated Derivatives of C70</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis reveal the structures of two photoadducts of C70 with 1a as [d,d&#8217;]&#8208;1,4&#8208;adduct 2a and as [a,b]&#8208;1,2&#8208;adduct 3a. The latter structure represents the first example of crystallographic study of 1,3&#8208;disilolane (1,3&#8208;disilacyclopentane) derivatives of fullerenes. The electronic property of 3a was characterized based on electrochemical measurements and theoretical calculations.

The photoreactions of C70 and mesityl&#8208;substituted disilirane (disilacyclopropane) 1a afforded the corresponding adducts 2a and 3a, the former of which was reported previously. The structures of 2a and 3a are unequivocally established respectively as a 1,4&#8208;adduct at the [d,d'] site and as a 1,2&#8208;adduct at the [a,b] bond, respectively, using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses. The latter structure represents the first example of crystallographic study of 1,3&#8208;disilolane (1,3&#8208;disilacyclopentane) derivatives of fullerenes. The electronic properties of these products are characterized based on electrochemical and theoretical studies elucidating the electron&#8208;donating effects of silyl groups.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Tetrahydropyridines via Borrowing Hydrogen Strategy</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a manganese&#8208;catalyzed borrowing hydrogen cyclization of secondary alcohols with &#947;&#8208;amino alcohols in a practical synthesis of 2,3,4,5&#8208;tetrahydropyridines is reported. A wide range of different 1&#8208;substituted ethanols&#160;and 3&#8208;amino alcohols could undergo the homogenous manganese&#8208;catalyzed process smoothly and furnish the corresponding products with overall moderate to good yields.

Tetrahydropyridines are versatile compounds widely used in organic synthesis and drug manufacturing. Herein, a manganese&#8208;catalyzed borrowing hydrogen coupling of 1&#8208;substituted ethanol derivatives with &#947;&#8208;amino alcohols is reported. This novel protocol has a broad substrate scope with good functional group tolerance and affords a diverse library of valuable 2,6&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydropyridines in moderate to good yields. Mechanistically, the reaction proceeds sequentially through catalytic dehydrogenation, dual cross&#8208;condensation, and further hydrogenation of the formed unsaturated intermediates to yield the desired tetrahydropyridines.

         <title>New Glycoconjugates Containing Selenium and Polyphenols. Stereoselective Synthesis by Pummerer&#8208;like Rearrangement.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two series of novel six&#8208;membered Se&#8208;glycoconjugates containing hydroxycinnamic acids marked by well&#8208;known antioxidant properties are synthesized, exploiting a Mitsunobu reaction and a Pummerer&#8208;like rearrangement. A first example of six&#8208;membered selenosugar with selenium in the ring and bearing an acetal&#8208;like functional group at C&#8208;1 was reported, which is a useful precursor of hydrolytically stable oligosaccharide and nucleoside mimics.

In the last 20&#8201;years the exploitation of antioxidant activity of selenobased compounds has improved, just due to the use of Ebselen, a selenocompound, as a Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) mimic. However, their clinical use seems to be compromised by the low solubility in water. To deal with this problem, it is possible to take advantage of the new approach including selenosugars in which selenium replaces heterocyclic oxygen. In this frame, to optimize the antioxidant properties of selenosugars, the glycoconjugation with a polyphenolic unit, which is a molecule capable of inhibiting or disabling the action of free radicals, has been considered in this work. The Mitsunobu reaction mechanism links covalently the primary alcoholic function of selenobased glycosyl donors, coming from the commercially available d&#8208;mannose, and phenolic moiety acceptors, to obtain the corresponding glycoconjugates, has been exploited affording the products in efficient yields. A density functional theory (DFT) theoretical study is carried out to help understand the possible influence of the seleno donor on the reactivity. Crucially, a new pathway based on Pummerer&#8208;like rearrangement followed by a glycosylation, gave a selenosugar with selenium in the ring and bearing an acetal&#8208;like functional group at C&#8208;1. All compounds are characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy confirming their structures and purity.

Attempting to address the growing synthetic complexity (SC) of conjugated polymers, the interdependent syntheses of the common acceptors 4,7&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (Br2BTD), 5,8&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihexylquinoxaline (Br2Qx), and 4,7&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2H&#8208;benzotriazole (Br2BTA) are all revisited. The SC Index is determined for both the traditional and optimized syntheses, showing improvements in the generation of all three acceptors.

In an attempt to address the growing problem of synthetic complexity in conjugated organic polymers, the synthesis of the common acceptor units 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (BTD), quinoxaline (Qx), and 2H&#8208;benzotriazole (BTA) have been revisited, along with their dibromo derivatives necessary for use in catalytic cross&#8208;coupling. In addition to reducing the total number of synthetic steps, efforts have been made to reduce hazardous reagents and simplify purification. Synthetic complexity index values for both established and newly reported methods are then generated in order to provide a qualitative evaluation of the reduced contribution of these common building blocks to the synthetic complexity of all materials that contain them.

Silver&#8208;Mediated Cascade Synthesis of Open&#8208;Cage Fullerenes from C60 and Propargylic Carbonates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bisfulleroids featuring an eight&#8208;membered ring orifice are synthesized in a one&#8208;pot approach via a multistep reaction sequence involving heating a solution of fullerene C60 and propargylic carbonates in the presence of a silver catalyst. The implementation of this strategy for the introduction of various substituents is thoroughly investigated.

In recent years, open&#8208;cage fullerenes (i.e., fullerene derivatives featuring an orifice within their cage structure) have attracted significant attention across multiple research areas in materials, coordination, supramolecular, and biomolecular chemistry. However, the methodology available for the preparation of open&#8208;cage fullerenes remains limited. Herein, it is discovered that upon heating fullerene C60 with propargylic carbonates in the presence of silver trifluoroacetate, a cascade of reaction steps is initiated, resulting in the one&#8208;step synthesis of the corresponding open&#8208;cage bisfulleroids. Moreover, the feasibility of introducing various substituents via this methodology is confirmed. Notably, the proposed protocol facilitates the synthesis of bisfulleroid derivatives, wherein a hydrogen atom resides on one side of the bridgehead carbon at the orifice, while an aryl or alkyl substituent is strategically introduced on the opposite side. This approach provides structural diversity for the synthesis of open&#8208;cage fullerenes and is expected to promote the widespread application of open&#8208;cage fullerene derivatives.

         <title>Escape from Flatland: Pericyclic Reactions and Rearrangements of Diazofluorene with Biarylcyclooctynes for the Generation of Helicene&#8208;Like Phenanthro&#8208;Pyrazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the voyage of two flat, highly unsaturated systems into the third dimension. Specifically, we investigated the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of 9&#8208;diazofluorene with a rapidly growing class of strained dipolarophile&#8212;biarylcyclooctynes. We found that the initial spirocyclic 3H&#8208;pyrazole cycloadducts are isolable, and can be subjected to controllable [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic shifts. These van Alphen&#8211;H&#252;ttel rearrangements generate either the metastable 4H&#8208;pyrazoles&#8212;another spirocyclic fused&#8208;ring system with a highly contorted structure&#8212;or the thermodynamically favored 1H&#8208;pyrazoles. The 1H&#8208;pyrazoles display extended conjugation and can be classified as [5]&#8208;helicenes containing a phenanthro&#8208;pyrazole fused to a dihydro&#8208;cyclooctatetraene. Overall, these studies provide a modular framework to control heteroatom placement, ring size, and ring fusion in the syntheses of carbon&#8208;rich materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of N,N'&#8208;Bisindoles via Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Formal (4 + 1) Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for the efficient synthesis of N,N'&#8208;bisindoles has been established by gold&#8208;catalyzed formal (4&#8201;+&#8201;1) cycloaddition.This reaction occurred via a domino aza&#8211;Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement/aza&#8211;Michael addition sequence, which allows for the formation of two C&#63743;N bonds and the direct construction of an indole ring.

Indole&#8208;based heterocycles are commonly found in natural products and pharmaceuticals, so the synthesis of such heterocycles has become an important research area. In spite of the rapid development of this research area, the synthesis of N,N'&#8208;bisindoles remains challenging and is far less developed. Herein, we present the synthesis of N,N'&#8208;bisindoles via gold&#8208;catalyzed formal (4&#8201;+&#8201;1) cycloaddition of alkynylcyclohexadienones with N&#8208;aminoindoles, which involves a domino aza&#8211;Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement/aza&#8211;Michael addition sequence. This reaction allows for the formation of two C&#63743;N bonds and the direct construction of an indole ring, leading to the synthesis of a range of N,N'&#8208;bisindoles in moderate to high yields with broad functional group tolerance. This work not only provides a new and efficient strategy toward the synthesis of N,N'&#8208;bisindoles but also enriches the research contents of formal (4&#8201;+&#8201;1) cycloadditions and domino reactions.

A series of 2&#8208;carbonylmethyl substituted pyrrolidines and piperidines can be accessed from readily available propargylic alcohols and N&#8208;protected amino olefins through a tandem Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement/olefin cross&#8208;metathesis/intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition under Au and Ru catalysis. The stereochemical outcome of the Au&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition is kinetically controlled and depended on the nitrogen protecting group.

Herein reported is tandem synthesis of 2&#8208;carbonylmethyl pyrrolidine/piperidine derivatives from propargylic alcohols under multimetallic catalysis. A Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement of propargylic alcohols under cationic Au catalysis, followed by in&#8201;situ olefin cross&#8208;metathesis with appropriately protected amino olefins delivered &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, which without isolation underwent an intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition to afford a variety of pyrrolidine and piperidine derivatives. The scope of the present tandem reaction is investigated to show that common amine protecting groups, such as Ts, Ns, Cbz, and Bz, are well tolerated. Addition of a catalytic amount of bismuth(III) triflate is required for promoting the intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition where the N&#8208;protected amino group is less nucleophilic. The stereochemical consequence of the present tandem reaction is found to be dependent on the amine protecting group.

         <title>Enantioselective Anion&#8208;Binding&#8208;Catalyzed Nucleophilic Addition to 4&#8208;Quinolones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first organocatalytic enantioselective formal 1,4&#8208;addition to 4&#8208;quinolones has been developed. This method relies on chiral triazole&#8208;based anion&#8208;binding catalysis using enol nucleophiles, complementing previous metal catalytic approaches. Moderate to good yields and enantioselectivities were achieved by in&#8201;situ silylation and formation of a key quinolinium&#8208;catalyst chiral contact ion pair, allowing for chirality transfer to the product upon nucleophilic attack.

Chiral quinolones and their derivatives are predominant synthetic building blocks and pharmacological agents. Nevertheless, their synthesis mostly relies on transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective 1,4&#8208;additions of organometallic reagents such as Grignard, organozinc, or organoboron species for alkylation, arylation, and alkynylation reactions. Herein, the first organocatalytic enantioselective formal 1,4&#8208;addition to challenging 4&#8208;quinolones is reported, upon in&#8201;situ silylation to the corresponding quinolinium ions, followed by asymmetric nucleophilic attack to this type of substrates. This method complements previous metal&#8208;catalyzed approaches by enrolling enol nucleophiles and relies on anion&#8208;binding catalysis using a chiral triazole&#8208;based anion binder. The enantioenriched 2&#8208;substituted 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4&#8208;quinolones were thus obtained in good yields (up to 97% yield) and enantioselectivities up to 89:11 e.r. Finally, the easy access to 4&#8208;amino and &#947;&#8211;amino alcohol derivatives by post&#8208;functionalization, as well as to enantiopure compounds (&gt;99:1 e.r.), was showcased. The notable features of this protocol include its mild reaction conditions, avoiding the use of transition metals, broad functional group tolerance, and potential application toward the synthesis of chiral 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4&#8208;quinolones and tetrahydroquinolines as important skeletons of bioactive and natural products.

         <title>Hydrosilylation of Terminal Alkenes Catalyzed by a Scandium Metalloligand Supported Ni(0) Complex</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrosilylation of terminal alkenes catalyzed by a scandium metalloligand supported zero&#8208;valent nickel complex is reported. The resting&#8208;state complex containing a Ni(0)&#63743;Si bond is characterized by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopic methods and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Redox neutral catalytic cycles based on metal&#8208;ligand cooperation involving a Ni(0)&#63743;Si bond is disclosed.

Hydrosilylation of terminal alkenes catalyzed by a scandium metalloligand supported Ni(0) complex are studied. The anti&#8208;Markovnikov products are obtained in 62&#8211;89% yield, along with the alkanes and 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetraphenyldisilane as minor products. The resting&#8208;state complexes of hydrosilylation reactions are isolated and characterized by spectroscopic method and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, which represent rare&#8208;example of Ni(0) silyl complexes supported by scandium ions via a Ni(0)&#8594;Sc(III) interaction. The catalytic cycle is proposed to be redox neutral with Ni(0) center, and is facilitated by metal&#8208;ligand cooperation involving the Ni(0)&#63743;Si bond.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Ligand Cooperation for Iron(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Wittig&#8208;Type Olefination from Alcohols in Air</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot in situ alcohol oxidation&#8211;Wittig reaction in air using aphosphine&#8208;free Fe(II) catalyst (1) bearing a redox&#8208;active tridentate arylazo pincer was used to synthesize a broad range of substituted E olefins by dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols and phosphonium ylides. Mechanistic investigations revealed active participation of the arylazo scaffold as an electron and hydrogen reservoir in the catalytic cycle.

An iron&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot tandem in&#8201;situ oxidation&#8211;Wittig reaction is reported for the synthesis of alkenes. Using a bench&#8208;stable Fe(II) catalyst with a redox&#8208;noninnocent 2&#8208;((4&#8208;chlorophenyl)diazenyl)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligand scaffold, a broad spectrum of substituted E olefins is synthesized in good yields by the reaction of alcohols with phosphorus ylides. Control reactions and spectroscopic studies indicate synergistic participation of the ligand, which acts as a reservoir of electrons and hydrogen, during the dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols with the phosphorus ylides.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Allylation and Tandem Allylation&#8211;Cycloisomerization of Stannylated Propargyl Acetates with Allylsilanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and general method for the gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed allylation and tandem allylation&#8211;cycloisomerization of stannylated propargyl acetates with allylsilanes for the synthesis of 1,5&#8208;enynes, with a terminal alkyne, and bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes was developed. Stannylated propargyl acetates proved useful for improving the selective formation of 1,5&#8208;enynes and bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes. The tributylstannyl group is a transient protecting group that prevents side reactions.

Bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes, synthesized by the cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;enynes, serve as key scaffolds in various natural products. Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;enynes is an efficient route to bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes. However, gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed 1,5&#8208;enyne synthesis, particularly with a terminal alkyne, has not yet been fully explored. This study presents a mild and general method for the gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed allylation and tandem allylation&#8211;cycloisomerization of stannylated propargyl acetates with allylsilanes, yielding 1,5&#8208;enynes with terminal alkyne moiety and bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes. The catalytic system ((4&#8208;MeOC6H4)3PAuCl/AgSbF6) enabled the efficient synthesis of 1,5&#8208;enynes with good to high yields and regioselectivities. In addition, gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed tandem allylation&#8211;cycloisomerization using (JohnPhos)Au(MeCN)SbF6 afforded bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes with high regiocontrol. Stannylated propargyl acetates proved crucial in enhancing selectivity for both product classes.

&lt;p&gt;A mild and general method for the gold(I)-catalyzed allylation and tandem allylation&#8211;cycloisomerization of stannylated propargyl acetates with allylsilanes for the synthesis of 1,5-enynes, with a terminal alkyne, and bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-2-enes was developed. Stannylated propargyl acetates proved useful for improving the selective formation of 1,5-enynes and bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-2-enes. The tributylstannyl group is a transient protecting group that prevents side reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-2-enes, synthesized by the cycloisomerization of 1,5-enynes, serve as key scaffolds in various natural products. Gold(I)-catalyzed cycloisomerization of 1,5-enynes is an efficient route to bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-2-enes. However, gold(I)-catalyzed 1,5-enyne synthesis, particularly with a terminal alkyne, has not yet been fully explored. This study presents a mild and general method for the gold(I)-catalyzed allylation and tandem allylation&#8211;cycloisomerization of stannylated propargyl acetates with allylsilanes, yielding 1,5-enynes with terminal alkyne moiety and bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-2-enes. The catalytic system ((4-MeOC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PAuCl/AgSbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) enabled the efficient synthesis of 1,5-enynes with good to high yields and regioselectivities. In addition, gold(I)-catalyzed tandem allylation&#8211;cycloisomerization using (JohnPhos)Au(MeCN)SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; afforded bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-2-enes with high regiocontrol. Stannylated propargyl acetates proved crucial in enhancing selectivity for both product classes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improved Chemical Synthesis of Avenanthramides Family and its Analogs by Mixed Anhydride Method</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Valuable phytochemicals, including avenanthramides A, B, C, E, and some analogs, have been rapidly prepared as carbonate&#8208;protected derivatives in acetone, achieving high yields by crystallization.. This process utilizes the mixed anhydride method with a triethylamine&#8208;isobutyl chloroformate reagent system. The protection can be readily removed on demand by treating it with morpholine in methanol for one hour, yielding almost quantitative amounts of free avenanthramides.

Amides derived from common hydroxycinnamic acids&#8212;including 4&#8208;hydroxycinnamic acid, 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxycinnamic acid, 3,4&#8208;dihydroxycinnamic acid, 3,4&#8208;dimethoxycinnamic acid, and 3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxycinnamic acid&#8212;along with various free aminobenzoic acids, such as 5&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;aminobenzoic acid, a key component of the avenanthramide family, have been rapidly synthesized using an innovative, environmentally friendly synthetic methodology. This approach, grounded in traditional chemistry, utilizes mixed anhydrides to simultaneously protect and activate hydroxycinnamic acids through the actions of triethylamine and isobutyl chloroformate while employing acetone as a green solvent. The resulting amides, formed from the coupling with free aromatic amino acids, are constructed as O&#8208;carbonate&#8208;protected derivatives with high yields and purity, isolated directly via crystallization, thus eliminating chromatographic or HPLC purifications. Furthermore, free phenols can be conveniently released on demand using morpholine in methanol. Under these conditions, C&#8208;protected aromatic amino acids remain unacylated. This synthetic strategy represents a significant advancement over conventional acyl chloride methodologies, which often rely on toxic reagents and solvents and entail time&#8208;consuming and complex procedures. It enhances the production of important phytochemicals such as avenanthramides and opens doors to various analogs, paving the way for potential pharmacological applications.

         <title>Electroreductive Intramolecular Heck&#8208;Type Cyclization for the Synthesis of Benzofused Oxygenated Heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electroreductive strategy for synthesizing diverse benzofused oxygenated heterocycles via 5&#8208; or 6&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization. This method eliminates the need for transition&#8208;metal catalysts while suppressing competing hydrogenation and halogenation pathways at the exocyclic carbon radical center. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, exhibits excellent substrate tolerance, and improves atom economy.

Conventional synthetic routes to benzofused oxygenated heterocycles, such as dihydrobenzofuran, chromane, and isochromane derivatives, often involve complex synthetic conditions, high costs, and environmental concerns. The key to addressing this challenge lies in achieving transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C(sp2)&#63743;I bond cleavage to enable intramolecular radical cyclization. Inspired by electroreductive strategies, a convenient, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free electroreductive tandem reaction is developed for synthesizing dihydrobenzofuran, chromane, and isochromane derivatives. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that this approach not only simplifies synthetic conditions but also suppresses competing hydrogenation and halogenation pathways at the exocyclic carbon radical center.

         <title>Assembly of Molecular Complexity by Carbene Organocatalytic Multi&#8208;component Reactions involving &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Aldehydes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pursuit of molecular complexity is central to modern organic synthesis, as complex molecules are essential across various fields. The development of catalytic multi&#8208;component transformation strategies provides an efficient approach for the rapid and selective construction of complex molecular frameworks. Over the past decades, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis has emerged as a powerful tool in multi&#8208;component reactions (MCRs), enabling precise control over selectivity, stereochemistry, and functional group compatibility that significantly facilitate the assembly of complex molecular structures. This review provides an overview of recent advancements in carbene&#8208;catalyzed MCRs involving &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, with an emphasis on reactions incorporating three or more reactants. These transformations are categorized into electron&#8208;pairing and radical pathways, with a detailed discussion of their mechanisms, scope and limitations. Ultimately, this review aims to advance the development of catalytic strategies that leverage carbene organocatalysis to enable the efficient synthesis of value&#8208;added molecules from simple precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox Catalytic Two&#8208;Component Radical &#946;&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;Fluorosulfonamidation Reaction of Styrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed fluoro/fluorosulfonamidation reaction of styrenes by using 1&#8208;fluorosulfamoyl&#8208;pyridinium salt as a bifunctional reagent is described, which allows for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;fluoro sulfamoyl fluorides under mild conditions.

In this study, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated two&#8208;component &#946;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;fluorosulfonamidation reaction of styrenes is demonstrated. The bench&#8208;stable reagent, N&#8208;fluorosulfamoyl&#8208;pyridinium tetrafluoroborate can be used as a photoredox&#8208;active nitrogen&#8208;centered radical precursor and also as the fluoride source. This transformation can convert a series of styrenes to functional group&#8208;enriched products, including substrates with electron&#8208;donating or withdrawing groups, as well as di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituents on the C&#63743;C double bond.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>

Multi&#8208;component reactions (MCRs) are atom&#8208;economic, ecofriendly methods for synthesizing complex molecules. Palladium and other transition metals serve as efficient catalysts by enabling C&#8211;C and C&#8211;heteroatom bond formation, offering energy savings and chemical diversity. Pd&#8208;MCRs are highly valued in synthetic chemistry for their excellent stereoselectivity, chemoselectivity, and remarkable functional group tolerance.

Multi&#8208;component reactions (MCRs) involve the reaction of three or more compounds to yield a single product. Typically, MCRs are eco&#8208;friendly and atom&#8208;economical processes, widely used to synthesize pharmaceutically relevant compounds with diverse applications in both medicinal and synthetic chemistry. Nowadays, transition metals are widely used as catalysts in MCRs due to their exceptional ability to create both C&#8211;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. Metal&#8208;catalyzed MCRs offer optimal chemical diversity, excellent atom economy, and energy savings.

         <title>SnCl2&#8208;Catalyzed Phosphorylation of Alcohols and Selective Phosphorylation/Phosphinoylation of Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, stannous chloride catalyzed phosphorylation of alcohols and selective phosphorylation of carbohydrates are explored, giving a new approach to obtain biologically active phosphorylated molecules.

Phosphorylated molecules, particularly phosphorylated carbohydrates, have garnered significant interest due to their distinct biological activities, driving an urgent demand for efficient phosphorylation strategies. Herein, the successful development of a SnCl2&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the phosphorylation of alcohols and carbohydrates is demonstrated. Notably, the reaction efficiency is found to be critically dependent on the addition order of SnCl2 and N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine, a phenomenon systematically investigated through mechanistic studies. A one&#8208;pot sequential ketalization/phosphorylation strategy is established for polyol substrates, enabling streamlined access to phosphorylated derivatives. The versatility of this approach is further exemplified by achieving selective phosphorylation/phosphinoylation of carbohydrates.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Promoted Direct C&#63743;S and C&#63743;Se Bond Formation from Csp3&#63743;H Bonds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the significant advancements in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed direct chalcogenylation of Csp3&#63743;H bonds over the past decade (2014&#8211;2024). The discussion is organized by transition metal catalysts, with particular emphasis on mechanistic insights of these transformations. Additionally, the review highlights the direct incorporation of various sulfur&#8208; and selenium&#8208;containing functional groups via diverse catalytic systems.

The transition metal&#8208;catalyzed direct C&#63743;S and C&#63743;Se bond formation from C&#63743;H bonds has emerged as an efficient synthetic strategy for constructing previously inaccessible organochalcogen compounds, opening a new gateway to late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutical&#8208;relevant molecules and organic functional materials. C&#63743;Y bonds (Y&#63742;S, Se, Te) also show outstanding strategic relevance as handles to access other valuable functional groups downstream in a synthetic route. Despite the significant progress, the chemo&#8208;, site&#8208;, and enantioselective C&#63743;S and C&#63743;Se bond formation from unactivated Csp3&#63743;H bonds is still challenging owing to its low polarity and inertness. Here, a comprehensive overview of the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed direct conversion of unactivated Csp3&#63743;H to C&#63743;S and C&#63743;Se bonds in the last decade is provided, looking to motivate the continuous discovery of innovative and efficient systems for these transformations.

         <dc:description>
We rapid here a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free reaction strategy for synthesizing unsymmetrical Z&#8208;azo&#8208;arenes from para&#8208;quinone methide (pQM) and arylhydrazine. This facile and straightforward base&#8208;mediated strategy tolerates a wide range of substrates and synthesizes several interesting azo&#8208;arenes in good yields with excellent stereospecificity. Additionally, DFT calculations are performed to support the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
A simple and straightforward method has been developed for the direct synthesis of unsymmetrical Z&#8208;azo&#8208;aryl compounds from p&#8208;quinone methide (p&#8208;QM) and arylhydrazine. This reaction strategy is executed in air under basic conditions and affords exclusively Z&#8208;isomers in good yields with a broad substrate scope. The stereochemistry of our synthesized azo&#8208;arenes has been confirmed by 2D&#8208;NMR analyses.

         <title>Chemoselective Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated Silyl Esters and Silyl Phosphonates Over Cyclopropanation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated silyl esters are an important class of compounds in organic, inorganic and pharmaceutical chemistry, known for their versatility and unique reactivity. The conjugated system in these compounds enables for Michael addition reactions, making them useful intermediates in the synthesis of complex organic/inorganic molecules, including pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and natural products. Having realized the importance of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated silyl esters, we have devised a strategy to synthesize various functionalized allyl and vinyl silanes using diazo compounds and respective silanes. Herein we have demonstrated that the allyl and vinyl silanes can react with diazo compounds in a chemoselective manner offering a versatile method for constructing C&#8208;C bond formation over the cyclopropanation reaction in the presence of 1 mol% of [Cp*RuCl2]n as a catalyst under mild conditions. Direct C&#8208;H bond functionalization of allyl and vinyl silanes with alpha diazo esters and phosphonate diazo showcasing the adaptability of silicon&#8208;based chemistry in modern organic synthesis. The plausible mechanism of the reaction has been realized with the help of DFT calculations. All the synthesized &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated siliyl esters were isolated and characterized by using sophisticated analytical and spectroscopic techniques.</dc:description>

The design of original disubstituted 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;ethano&#8208;1,5&#8208;naphthyridine derivatives is reported under classical and flow methodologies. The conditions are optimized and a wide range of boronic acids are used to determine the scope and limitations of Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura or Chan&#8211;Lam reactions.

The design of some novel disubstituted 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;ethano&#8208;1,5&#8208;naphthyridine derivatives is reported under classical and flow methodologies. The series are developed from quinuclidinone, which afford versatile platforms bearing one lactam function in position C&#8208;2 that is then used to create C&#9472;N bond using the Chan&#8211;Lam coupling reaction or in&#8201;situ C&#9472;O bond activation via palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The conditions are optimized and a wide range of boronic acids are used to determine the scope and limitations of each method. To complete this study, a flow Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura process is established to afford polyfunctionalized 1,4&#8208;ethano&#8208;1,5&#8208;naphthyridine derivatives in high yields with a very efficient process (10 min).

         <title>Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;Dimethyl Carboxylic Esters via Asymmetric Barbier Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric Barbier reaction toward &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;dimethyl carboxylic esters is studied. Utilization of indium and (+)&#8208;cinchonine or (&#8211;)&#8208;cinchonidine as chiral additives gives access to both enantiomers. By using different allyl and propargyl bromides 10 different derivatives of the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;dimethyl carboxylic esters are obtained in up to 81% yield and 98%ee.

Despite the occurrence of the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;dimethyl carboxylic ester motif in many natural products, no attempt is made to synthesize this core structure via a racemic and enantioselective Barbier reaction. In this study, the optimized reaction conditions for the achiral Barbier reaction between allyl bromide and a 2,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxopropanoate are found, yielding the desired &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;dimethyl carboxylic ester in up to 64%. Therefore, different metals, additives, solvents, and solvent mixtures are tested. The optimized reaction conditions are then used to expand the substrate scope of the Barbier reaction by using five structurally different allylic and propargylic bromides. By using (+)&#8208;cinchonine and (&#8211;)&#8208;cinchonidine as chiral additives along with indium in a tetrahydrofuran/hexane solvent mixture, it is possible to obtain 10 different &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;dimethyl carboxylic esters in an enantioenriched fashion with up to 81% yield and 98%ee.

         <dc:description>A three&#8208;component regioselective phosphorothiolation&#8208;halogenation of enamides/enoates with P(O)SH compounds and NXS (X = Cl, Br) under catalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free conditions has been demonstrated. This strategy readily affords an array of valuable amide/ester&#8208; and halogen&#8208;containing phosphorothioates in good to excellent yields, featuring with simple operations, diverse functional group tolerance and easy scale&#8208;up. Preliminary studies reveal that the electrophilic phosphoranesulfenyl chlorides/bromides generated in situ may be a key intermediate. Furthermore, phosphorothioated lactams can be easily obtained through the intramolecular substitution reaction of chlorophosphorothiolated amides. Notably, all of the tested products displayed potent and selective inhibitory activity toward butyrylcholinesterase.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Selenylation of 2&#8208;Alkenylanilines for the Synthesis of 3&#8208;Selanylindoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrosynthesis of valuable 3&#8208;selanylindoles by selenylation of 2&#8208;alkenylanilines under metal&#8208;free and chemical oxidant&#8208;free conditions is described. The reaction involves a radical pathway and features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and straightforward operation.

An electrocatalytic cascade selenylation/oxidation of 2&#8208;alkenylanilines enables the assembly of various 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;selanylindoles in one&#8208;pot under chemical oxidant&#8208;free and transition metal&#8208;free conditions is disclosed. A series of functional 3&#8208;selanylindoles are smoothly furnished in acceptable yields. This electrocatalytic strategy is flexibly suitable for diverse diaryl diselenides and 2&#8208;alkenylanilines. This method is highlighted by broad substrate scope, good functional group compatibility, mild conditions, and easy operation. The preliminarily mechanistic experiments suggest that a radical pathway is probably involved in this protocol.

         <title>Recent Advances on Light&#8208;Mediated Nitrene Transfer Reactions: An Emerging Area</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increasing attention has been paid to nitrene transfer reactions as they afford a direct access to nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds of utmost interest in life and material sciences. This review summarized the advances in photo&#8208;mediated nitrene transfer reactions from 1950s&#8211;2024, organized by the protocols for the nitrene formation: direct photolysis of diverse nitrene precursors and photocatalytic generation of free nitrenes.







Abstract
Nitrogen atoms are fundamental in biological systems and are widely found in approved drugs, natural products, and materials. Thus, catalytic methods for the C&#8722;N bond formation have attracted significant attention in synthetic chemistry. Among the toolbox, nitrene transfer reaction is one of the powerful protocols for the construction of N&#8208;incorporating frameworks with structural diversity. In this field, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer reactions have been extensively explored using different types of precursors. On the other hand, photochemistry offers a sustainable protocol in synthetic chemistry, which has emerged as an eco&#8208;friendly catalytic method in nitrene chemistry, particularly, with the induction of visible light as the initiator in this area.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen atoms are fundamental in biological systems and are widely found in approved drugs, natural products, and materials. Thus, catalytic methods for the C&#8722;N bond formation have attracted significant attention in synthetic chemistry. Among the toolbox, nitrene transfer reaction is one of the powerful protocols for the construction of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-incorporating frameworks with structural diversity. In this field, transition metal-catalyzed nitrene transfer reactions have been extensively explored using different types of precursors. On the other hand, photochemistry offers a sustainable protocol in synthetic chemistry, which has emerged as an eco-friendly catalytic method in nitrene chemistry, particularly, with the induction of visible light as the initiator in this area. In the last decade, a variety of visible-light-mediated synthetic transformations involving free nitrene species have been reported under mild reaction conditions. Thus, it is timely and highly desirable to summarize the advancements in this area. This review summarized the advances in photo-mediated nitrene transfer reactions from 1950s&#8211;2024, which is organized into two sections according to the protocols for the nitrene formation: (i) direct photolysis of diverse nitrene precursors and (ii) photocatalytic generation of free nitrenes.

         <title>Recent Advances in Transition Metal&#8208;Free Strategies for the Transformation of Amides into Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This comprehensive review articulates the recent advances in transition metal&#8208;free methodologies for amide bond activation. By integrating mechanistic insights with synthetic applications, it delineates sustainable strategies for the construction of carbonyl frameworks. Emphasis is placed on nucleophilic substitution, radical&#8208;mediated processes, and catalyst&#8208;driven approaches, providing a valuable resource for the efficient transformation of amides into esters, ketones, imides, and aldehydes.

Amides are fundamental functional groups in organic synthesis and play crucial roles in medicinal chemistry and materials science. Traditionally, amide transformations have often relied on transition metal catalysts; however, recent advances have demonstrated efficient transition metal&#8208;free strategies for amide bond activation. This review provides a comprehensive overview of emerging methodologies that enable selective formation of C&#63743;N, C&#63743;C, C&#63743;O, C&#63743;H, and C&#63743;X bonds. Key developments that offer sustainable and practical alternatives to conventional approaches include borate&#8208; and boronic acid&#8208;mediated transamidations, phosphoric acid&#8208;promoted transformations, and radical&#8208;based strategies. Additionally, nucleophilic substitutions with carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen&#8208;based nucleophiles have expanded the synthetic utility of amides by yielding diverse carbonyl and heterocyclic compounds. Mechanistic insights into these transformations reveal the role of electronic and steric effects in amide reactivity. By categorizing these methodologies based on amide substrates and reaction pathways, this review aims to provide a valuable resource for researchers seeking efficient, metal&#8208;free strategies for amide bond manipulation.

         <title>Determination of the Transfer Rate&#160;of Porphyrins from Polysaccharides to Lipid Membranes in the Preparation of Lipid Membranes Incorporating&#160;Porphyrins by the Host&#8208;Exchange Process</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing straightforward and efficient methods for incorporating functional hydrophobic guest molecules into lipid membranes is essential for the application of liposomes as drug delivery systems. In a previous study, we reported the preparation of lipid&#8208;membrane&#8208;incorporated C60, C60 derivatives, and C70 (LMICx) through a host&#8208;exchange method, wherein these molecules were transferred from &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin to liposomes. In this study, we applied a similar host&#8208;exchange approach to prepare lipid&#8208;membrane&#8208;incorporated porphyrins (LMIPors), transferring porphyrins from polysaccharides to liposomes. However, until now, there has been no means to determine the transfer rates. To determine the transfer rates of porphyrins from polysaccharides to liposomes, we developed a method involving the collapse of LMIPors via complex formation between lipids and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin. We believe that this method is general and can be deployed to liposomes incorporating various guest molecules prepared as drug delivery systems on the host&#8208;exchange process.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Hydroformylation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Ester: Spectroscopic Studies on Catalytic Species and the Influence of Ligands on Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triphenylphosphine&#8208;free Rh catalysts are the preferred catalyst type for the regioselective hydroformylation of methyl 4&#8208;chlorocinnamate to the pharmaceutically interesting racemic &#946;&#8208;aldehyde. High regioselectivities of 88&#8211;93&#8201;% to the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde were obtained with various phosphine ligand&#8208;free rhodium complexes. In contrast, adding triphenylphosphine as common phosphine ligand shifts the regioselectivity to the undesired &#945;&#8208;aldehyde.







Abstract
Hydroformylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters is an atom&#8208;economical route towards aldehydes as precursors for pharmaceuticals. In this work, regioselective hydroformylation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ester to the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde was initially re&#8208;evaluated using a commercial Rh catalyst sample named &#8220;[HRh(PPh3)4]&#8221; due to reported high selectivity for the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde with this type of catalyst. However, while such high selectivity was achieved, subsequent investigation of this sample by high&#8208;pressure NMR and in&#8197;situ IR spectroscopy under process conditions revealed a behavior like a phosphine&#8208;free system, indicating that the sample is decomposed and may be present as rhodium carbonyl clusters. This hypothesis has been supported by hydroformylation experiments with and without phosphine ligands. While a strong decrease in regioselectivity to the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde was observed in the presence of triphenylphosphine as added ligand, phosphine&#8208;free rhodium complexes led to high regioselectivities. In detail, the hydroformylation showed high regioselectivity (91&#8201;%) and overall selectivity to the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde (70&#8211;77&#8201;%) with [Rh6(CO)16] as well as [Rh(acac)(CO)2] as ligand&#8208;free rhodium complexes. With further unmodified, phosphine&#8208;free rhodium compounds as catalysts, again high regioselectivities (90&#8211;93&#8201;%) towards the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde were obtained. Thus, our results indicate that non&#8208;modified triphenylphosphine&#8208;free Rh catalysts are efficient catalysts for regioselective hydroformylation of &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylates to the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde.

     alt="Regioselective Hydroformylation of an &#945;,&#946;-Unsaturated Ester: Spectroscopic Studies on Catalytic Species and the Influence of Ligands on Regioselectivity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triphenylphosphine-free Rh catalysts are the preferred catalyst type for the regioselective hydroformylation of methyl 4-chlorocinnamate to the pharmaceutically interesting racemic &#946;-aldehyde. High regioselectivities of 88&#8211;93&#8201;% to the &#946;-aldehyde were obtained with various phosphine ligand-free rhodium complexes. In contrast, adding triphenylphosphine as common phosphine ligand shifts the regioselectivity to the undesired &#945;-aldehyde.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydroformylation of &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated esters is an atom-economical route towards aldehydes as precursors for pharmaceuticals. In this work, regioselective hydroformylation of an &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated ester to the &#946;-aldehyde was initially re-evaluated using a commercial Rh catalyst sample named &#8220;[HRh(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8221; due to reported high selectivity for the &#946;-aldehyde with this type of catalyst. However, while such high selectivity was achieved, subsequent investigation of this sample by high-pressure NMR and &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; IR spectroscopy under process conditions revealed a behavior like a phosphine-free system, indicating that the sample is decomposed and may be present as rhodium carbonyl clusters. This hypothesis has been supported by hydroformylation experiments with and without phosphine ligands. While a strong decrease in regioselectivity to the &#946;-aldehyde was observed in the presence of triphenylphosphine as added ligand, phosphine-free rhodium complexes led to high regioselectivities. In detail, the hydroformylation showed high regioselectivity (91&#8201;%) and overall selectivity to the &#946;-aldehyde (70&#8211;77&#8201;%) with [Rh&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;] as well as [Rh(acac)(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] as ligand-free rhodium complexes. With further unmodified, phosphine-free rhodium compounds as catalysts, again high regioselectivities (90&#8211;93&#8201;%) towards the &#946;-aldehyde were obtained. Thus, our results indicate that non-modified triphenylphosphine-free Rh catalysts are efficient catalysts for regioselective hydroformylation of &#946;-aryl-substituted &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated carboxylates to the &#946;-aldehyde.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Ectocarpin A</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully enantioselective total synthesis of ectocarpin A, a new oxylipin, has been achieved in 12 steps starting from tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;cyclopentafuranone. Key steps include the formation of the chiral core, diastereoselective epoxidation, enzymatic desymmetrization of a 1,4&#8208;diol, epimerization, and strategic Wittig and Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefinations to construct the carbon framework.

A total enantioselective synthesis of ectocarpin A, an oxylipin identified through the first hydroperoxide bicyclase activity of CYP5164A3 in brown algae, has been successfully completed in 12 steps starting from tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;cyclopentafuranone. Key transformations include the creation of the chiral tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;cyclopentafuranone, a diastereoselective epoxidation, an enzymatic desymmetrization of a 1,4&#8208;diol, an epimerization, and both Wittig and Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefinations to build the carbon framework of ectocarpin A.

         <title>Oxidative Cyclization of 1,7&#8208;Dienes Induced by &#945;&#8208;Oxyalkyl/Acyl Radicals to Access Functionalized Benzo[b]azepin&#8208;2&#8208;Ones</title>

         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free oxidative cascade cyclization strategy is presented that enables the efficient transformation of 1,7&#8208;dienes with readily available radical precursors, including alcohols, ethers, and aryl aldehydes, into structurally diverse benzo[b]azepin&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives.

A metal&#8208;free cascade oxidative cyclization method has been developed for synthesizing functionalized benzo[b]azepin&#8208;2&#8208;ones from 1,7&#8208;dienes using alcohols, ethers, or aryl aldehydes. The reaction generates &#945;&#8208;oxyalkyl or acyl radicals by direct C(sp3)&#63743;H or C(sp2)&#63743;H cleavage, avoiding photocatalysts and transition metals. This approach offers a mild strategy for the synthesis of benzo[b]azepine derivatives with high atom economy and efficiency. Mechanistic studies, including radical trapping and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry analysis, confirm a radical&#8208;mediated pathway involving cyclization and single&#8208;electron transfer.

         <title>An Electrochemical Method for Decarboxylative Halogenation of Aryl Propynoic Acids with Potassium Halides under Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical decarboxylative halogenation of aryl propynoic acids has been established to synthesize haloalkynes under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. This electrochemical decarboxylation and iodination or bromination of aryl propynoic acids feature simple reaction steps, inexpensive materials, good functional group tolerance, and environmentally friendly reaction conditions.

Herein, an electrochemical method for the decarboxylative halogenation of aryl propynoic acids under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions is reported. In an undivided cell, diverse aryl propynoic acids and KX are employed to synthesize a series of haloalkynes. Mechanistic studies demonstrate the possible involvement of a free&#8208;radical intermediate in the transformation.

         <title>Terpenes and Terpenoids: How can we use them?</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transition from petroleum&#8208;based to renewable bio&#8208;based chemicals has led to increased interest in terpenes and terpenoids. This overview highlights their chemistry, focusing on their reactivity and applications in polymerizations, total syntheses, pharmaceuticals, and bio&#8208;based chemical conversions; promoting sustainable and green chemical processes.

As one of the twelve fundamental principles of green chemistry, the employed feedstocks in chemical processes received substantial attention over the past decades. These efforts can be attributed to Werpy's 2004 list of top&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals from biomass. Conventional fossil&#8208;based feedstocks are both depleting and environmentally damaging, leading to the transition towards renewable, bio&#8208;based platform chemicals. Terpenes and terpenoids are a group of bio&#8208;based compounds well known throughout the scientific community. Although their acquirement from natural feedstocks is well known, comprehensive overviews of their applications in synthetic&#160;chemistry remain limited. Herein, a full comprehensive overview of the reported chemistry with terpenes is provided, while specifically highlighting their reactivity. Fifteen of the most common and useful monoterpenes and terpenoids are discussed, followed by a list of the remaining known compounds belonging to this group. These fifteen compounds have been employed in a vast number of chemical transformations with different applications including: polymerizations, total syntheses, chiral reagents/auxiliaries, pharmaceuticals, and chemical conversion to other useful bio&#8208;based chemicals. The presented chemistry in this work aims to provide chemists with a useful tool that should facilitate and stimulate the search for more sustainable, renewable, and environmentally friendly starting points for novel synthesis routes.

Rhodium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Oxo&#8208;Amination of Aryl Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#946;&#8208;Amino ketones were formed by rhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxo&#8208;amination of aryl cyclopropanes with water and N&#8208;fluorobisbenzenesulfonamide (NFSI) under mild conditions. The good substrate scope of the reaction and radical&#8208;ionic mechanism&#8212;driven by single electron transfer, hydrogen atom transfer, and radical&#8208;polar crossover&#8212;reveal the versatility of rhodium(II) in oxo&#8208;amination chemistry.

A rhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed method is described for synthesizing &#946;&#8208;amino ketones from aryl cyclopropanes, utilizing water as an oxygen source and N&#8208;fluorobis(benzenesulfonamide) as a commercially available nitrogen source. This approach offers good substrate tolerance under mild conditions, providing a novel and practical route for &#946;&#8208;amino ketone synthesis. Mechanistic studies reveal a sequential cascade pathway initiated by single&#8208;electron transfer facilitated by the rhodium(II) catalyst, followed by hydrogen atom transfer and radical polar crossover steps. These insights underscore the potential of rhodium(II) in driving radical amination reactions, enhancing the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino ketones from simple precursors.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Rearrangement&#8208;Driven Formal (3+2) Cycloaddition of Enaminone&#8208;Based Thioalkynes with Nitriles to Form Thiazole&#8208;Containing Bis&#8208;heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydropyridin&#8208;2(H)&#8208;one containing thiazole derivatives by Bronsted acid&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;rearrangement and formal (3+2) cycloaddition reaction of enaminone&#8208;based thioalkyne with alkyl/aryl nitrile. The developed protocol demonstrates a wide substrate scope for both the reacting partners with high atom&#8208;economy furnishing very high to excellent yields of pharmaceutically relevant bis&#8208;heterocyclic derivatives. Based on outcome of the product and control experiments, a plausible reaction mechanism has also been proposed. The gram&#8208;scale synthesis and further synthetic transformation demonstrate the synthetic efficacy and utility of the developed protocol.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An efficient catalyst&#8208;free, solvent&#8208;free amination reaction has been developed for the synthesis of various bio&#8208;inspired 6&#8208;substituted amino purine nucleoside analogues in good yields. In this sustainable approach, unprotected 6&#8208;substituted aminopurine nucleoside analogues were synthesized via amination reactions of unprotected 6&#8208;Cl purine nucleosides with various&#160;amine derivatives. Notably, this method offers a simple, eco&#8208;friendly, unifying protocol for the synthesis of various bioinspired molecules with highly functional group tolerance. Additionally, to demonstrate its synthetic applicability, a one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component reaction protocol has been shown for the synthesis of novel 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;attached hybrid nucleoside containing various drug core moieties via click chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Syntheses of the Linearly&#8208;Fused Prenylated Indole Alkaloids Asperversiamides H and M via Oxidative Rearrangement of the Putative Biosynthetic Precursor Dihydrocarneamide A</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An improved synthesis of the alkaloid dihydrocarneamide A is reported and this has been subjected to a biomimetic&#8208;type oxidative rearrangement using an oxaziridine and so affording the spiro&#8208;oxidole&#8208;containing and prenylated indole alkaloids (PIAs) asperversiamides H and M. This work serves to confirm the structure assigned to the latter. Oxidation of dihydrocarneamide A using m&#8208;chloroperbenzoic (m&#8208;CPBA) afforded an oxidative fragmentation product representing the linear isomer of the PIA amoenamide A and thus a potential "natural product in&#8208;waiting". Furthermore, oxaziridine&#8208;mediated oxidation of the epimer of dihydrocarneamide A (and the enantiomer of the structure assigned to the natural product asperversiamide F) afforded a mixture of two hitherto unreported spiro&#8208;oxindoles. Given the manner in which these last two products have been formed it seems likely that these, too, are "natural products in&#8208;waiting". Certain cytotoxic and anti&#8208;microbial properties of key compounds are reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed/Mediated C&#8722;SCF3 Bond Formation Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The trifluoromethylthiolated group (SCF3) is characterized by its strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability, excellent lipophilicity, good stability, and bioavailability, making it highly relevant for applications in drug design and development. This review summarizes recent advances in C&#8722;X (H, Cl, OTf, B(OH)2) trifluoromethylthiolation reaction from 2014 to 2024. The discussion is organized into three major sections: 1) transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H trifluoromethylthiolation reactions facilitated by directing groups (DGs), 2) transition metal&#8208;catalyzed trifluoromethylthiolation via cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and 3) light&#8208;assisted transition metal&#8208;catalyzed trifluoromethylthiolation reactions. Additionally, this review examines the substrate scope, limitations, and partial mechanisms associated with these transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation of Prenylated Pterocarpans from Synthetically Derived Demethylmedicarpin by Regioselective Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Hydroarylation and Related Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three prenylated pterocarpans including erybraedin A and erybraedin C have been synthesised from (&#177;)&#8208;demethylmedicarpin, itself prepared in four simple steps starting from resorcinol and 2,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenylacetic acid. A gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed and two&#8208;fold intramolecular hydroarylation (IMHA) reaction of a readily&#8208;derived bis&#8208;propargyl ether of (&#177;)&#8208;demethylmedicarpin proceeds with remarkable regio&#8208;selectivity to afford the racemate of a recently reported but yet&#8208;to&#8208;be named bis&#8208;2H&#8208;chromene&#8208;annulated pterocarpan&#8208;containing natural product. A possible explanation for this potentially very useful selectivity is advanced. In a related reaction sequence, a readily&#8208;derived bis&#8208;allyl ether of (&#177;)&#8208;demethylmedicarpin undergoes a thermally&#8208;induced and two&#8208;fold aromatic Claisen rearrangement (ACR) to give a 1:5 mixture of the racemic modifications of the isomeric and cytotoxic natural products erybraedin A and erybraedin C.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Atropisomeric Diarylamines Enabled by Bromine&#8208;Masked Indolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the use of a bromine atom as a masking group for the synthesis atropisomeric diarylamines via organocatalytic N&#8208;arylation of 7&#8208;bromoindolines. The bromine atom acts as a bulky group to temporarily stabilize the configuration by steric hindrance. Upon unmasking, less sterically hindered diarylamines are obtained, with configurational stability potentially maintained through intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Moreover, the gram&#8208;scale reaction and post&#8208;modifications of the axially chiral diarylamines demonstrated the utility of this protocol. Thermal racemization experiments combined with X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed the respective contributions of steric repulsion and intramolecular hydrogen bonding in stabilizing the configurations. This approach not only provides a useful method for the atroposelective construction of conical diarylamines, but also paves the way for a better understanding of stable axial chirality and its role in shaping chemical reactivity and biological activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Controlled [2+3] and [3+3] Annulation of Bisnucleophiles: Access to Oxygen Heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here a facile and efficient [2+3] and [3+3] annulation of bisnucleophiles have been developed, affording various of methylenetetrahydrofuran spirooxindole and methylenetetrahydropyrano[2,3&#8208;c]pyrazoles derivatves under mild reaction conditions. This method provides facile and alternative strategies for the cconstruction of functionalized oxacyclic products in moderate to good yields. In addition, the gram&#8208;scale reaction and synthesis transformations were performed to examine the practicability of this methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Dioxygenation of gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes to Generate &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes are valuable synthetic intermediates in organofluorine chemistry; however, their reactivity often involves intermediates prone to fluorine elimination, leading to monofluorinated products. Here, we present a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed dioxygenation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes with alcohols, which retains both fluorine atoms and yields &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers. This method is operationally simple, employs inexpensive and standard reagents, and demonstrates broad functional group tolerance. The reaction is scalable, enabling the use of the gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropane motif as a masked precursor for &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers in synthetic sequences. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest a radical&#8208;mediated process involving concerted SN2&#8208;like ring&#8208;opening functionalization.</dc:description>
