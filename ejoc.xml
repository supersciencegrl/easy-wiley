         <title>Activation in Organic and Macromolecular Including Peptide Synthesis by Fluorinated Carboxylic Acids and Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 44, November 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept paper highlights the importance and the historical developments of activated carboxylic acids in organic, macromolecular, bioorthogonal, and peptide synthesis. It dicusses the use of activated ester, including fluorinated activated ester and other activated carboxylic acid derivatives. The reactivity of various classes of activated carboylic acid derivatives obtained by fluorinated is discussed by employing aminolysis and transesterification reactions.

This concept article discusses recent developments in activated esters, including fluorinated activated esters and other activated carboxylic acid derivatives. Activated carboxylic acid derivatives, including esters, are of interest since 1901 when Emil Fischer prepared the first peptide, and soon after, for the synthesis of Nylons, Kevlar, and other condensation polymers. Since the synthesis of sequence&#8208;defined peptides and methodologies for their construction relied mostly on the development of activated ester derivatives, the preparation of the peptide and amide bond is used as a strategy for the organization and the development of this concept article. Therefore, the acyl chlorides, anhydrides, numerous nonfluorinated activated esters, and fluorinated activated esters, including pentachlorophenyl, pentafluorophenyl, hexafluoroisopropyl, and other fluorinated esters, will be discussed in aminolysis and transesterification reactions. The synthesis of peptide and amide bond, the modification of polymers, the bioorthogonal chemistry, and the living chain&#8208;growth condensation polymerization are also briefly discussed. This concept article ends with a brief mention of the resurgence of acyl fluoride in organic and macromolecular chemistry.

         <title>Environmental Control of Regio&#8208;/Stereoselectivity Across Mechanistically Similar Transformations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 44, November 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lewis Acid (LA) catalysis offers a unifying strategy to tune nucleophilic additions. By modulating electrophile activation, LAs shift regioselectivity in epoxide openings and diastereoselectivity in carbonyl additions by 43&#8211;76%. Strong LAs (e.g., AlCl3, SnCl4) amplify subtle bond or face differences, enabling predictable, high&#8208;impact control across mechanistically related transformations.

The control of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity in organic transformations remains a foundational challenge in synthetic chemistry. While chemoselectivity can often be influenced by careful selection of reagents or protective groups, controlling regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity is far more nuanced, often requiring highly specific reaction conditions. In this work, a unified approach for controlling both regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity across mechanistically related transformations is explored, specifically focusing on epoxide openings and carbonyl additions. It is demonstrated that the same environmental factors, here the nature of the Lewis acid (LA), can be leveraged to influence divergent outcomes in these two reaction types by amplifying inherent differences between reaction sites/faces, leading to highly selective transformations. The systematic evaluation of over 30 Lewis acids revealed a dichotomy between &#8220;labile&#8221; and &#8220;strong&#8221; activation modes, where strong LAs, such as AlCl3 and SnCl4, drive the highest levels of regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity for both transformations. Further, there exists nuanced differences between the degree of influence of some LA within these mechanistically related transformations. These findings suggest that environmental factors can be broadly applied across different mechanistic classes to achieve selectivity, offering a versatile strategy for reaction optimization.

         <title>Ni(OAc)2 Catalyzed N&#8208;Formylation of Primary Sulfonamides Using Carbon Dioxide at Ambient Pressure</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 44, November 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of carbon dioxide as a formyl equivalent toward the N&#8208;formylation of primary sulfonamides has been developed. This Ni(OAc)2 catalyzed protocol employs carbon dioxide under ambient pressure and enables the formylation of aryl, heteroaryl, and alkyl sulfonamides.

A Ni(OAc)2 catalyzed N&#8208;formylation of primary sulfonamides using gaseous carbon dioxide is reported. A range of aromatic, heteroaromatic, and aliphatic sulfonamides are formylated under ambient pressure of carbon dioxide in a closed system. This redox&#8208;neutral method represents a mechanistically novel and operationally convenient method for employing carbon dioxide as a formyl equivalent.

When 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds are used as the nucleophile, the corresponding substituted tetrahydrofuro[2,3&#8208;b]furans are formed. To further understand the nature of this reaction, the intramolecular nucleophilic addition of alkynyl diol intermediate with gold complex is investigated as a model substrate using DFT calculations.

         <title>The Nonlinear Optical Behavior of Linear Diamantane Polyamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 44, November 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diamondoid&#8208;based polyamides exhibit nonlinear optical properties, namely, they emit white light upon continuous&#8208;wave irradiation with infrared lasers. The use of diamantane monomers significantly enhances the thermal stability of such novel polyamides, thereby opening new avenues for efficient and durable, organic lighting applications.

We report the synthesis and characterization of a new family of single&#8208;component polyamides incorporating rigid diamantane monomers, and investigate their structural, thermal, and nonlinear optical properties. These polymers are largely amorphous and exhibit exceptional thermal stability, with decomposition events in the 400&#8211;600&#8201;&#176;C range, significantly exceeding those of conventional nylons such as nylon&#8208;6 and nylon&#8208;66. Thermal analysis further shows that polyamides containing aromatic units retain higher residual yields than purely aliphatic analogues. Powder X&#8208;Ray diffraction, dynamic light scattering, and scanning electron microscopy reveal pronounced morphological differences, ranging from irregular nanoscale particulates to smooth, rubbery domains. A direct correlation between morphology and optical behavior is observed: polyamides with disordered or finely particulate structures display intrinsic white&#8208;light emission (WLE, 490&#8211;700&#8201;nm, &#955;max&#8201;&#8776;&#8201;610&#8201;nm) under continuous near&#8208;infrared (980&#8201;nm) laser irradiation, whereas the smooth morphology suppresses this response.

     alt="The Nonlinear Optical Behavior of Linear Diamantane Polyamides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diamondoid-based polyamides exhibit nonlinear optical properties, namely, they emit white light upon continuous-wave irradiation with infrared lasers. The use of diamantane monomers significantly enhances the thermal stability of such novel polyamides, thereby opening new avenues for efficient and durable, organic lighting applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the synthesis and characterization of a new family of single-component polyamides incorporating rigid diamantane monomers, and investigate their structural, thermal, and nonlinear optical properties. These polymers are largely amorphous and exhibit exceptional thermal stability, with decomposition events in the 400&#8211;600&#8201;&#176;C range, significantly exceeding those of conventional nylons such as nylon-6 and nylon-66. Thermal analysis further shows that polyamides containing aromatic units retain higher residual yields than purely aliphatic analogues. Powder X-Ray diffraction, dynamic light scattering, and scanning electron microscopy reveal pronounced morphological differences, ranging from irregular nanoscale particulates to smooth, rubbery domains. A direct correlation between morphology and optical behavior is observed: polyamides with disordered or finely particulate structures display intrinsic white-light emission (WLE, 490&#8211;700&#8201;nm, &lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8776;&#8201;610&#8201;nm) under continuous near-infrared (980&#8201;nm) laser irradiation, whereas the smooth morphology suppresses this response. Importantly, this dopant-free WLE is unprecedented for polyamides, identifying diamantane-based polymers as an attractive platform for efficient, thermally robust, and cost-effective organic light-emitting materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Density Functional Theory&#8208;Genetic Algorithm Approach for the Structural Elucidation of Linear Diamantane Polyesters and their Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 44, November 28, 2025. </description>

Diamondoid polyesters emit white light upon continuous infrared laser irradiation. The structures of the polyesters are microcrystalline as determined with solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy combined with computational analyzes.

We report a series of diamantane polyesters synthesized as head&#8208;to&#8208;head and side&#8208;to&#8208;side linear chain polymers. The incorporation of the bulky and rigid diamantyl moiety significantly enhances the thermal stabilities of these polymers compared to well&#8208;established linear aliphatic polyesters, such as poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone), poly(lactic acid), poly(butylene succinate), and poly(glycolic acid). This enhancement is confirmed by thermogravimetric analyzes, which show degradation onsets in the range of 520 to 580&#8201;&#176;C. The structural characterization of these polyesters posed significant challenges due to virtual insolubility in organic solvents, limiting the use of techniques such as mass spectrometry and liquid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. To address these challenges, a genetic algorithm for structure prediction based on periodic density functional theory computations was employed, yielding a structure that closely matches the powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data. Heavily constrained Rietveld refinement provided excellent agreement with the experimental results. These findings, combined with solid&#8208;state NMR data, have been integrated to provide a comprehensive understanding of the polyester properties. These polyesters demonstrate promising nonlinear optical responses, including white&#8208;light emission upon continuous infrared laser irradiation, making them candidates for optoelectronic applications.

Herein, an easy&#8208;to&#8208;access and TM&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step synthesis of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;aroyl&#8208;5&#8208;sulfonamide substituted benzo[b]furans bearing many functional groups of different electronic and steric nature using thioamides and N&#8208;tosylbenzoquinone imine at room temperature in open air is reported for the first time.

Benzofuran derivatives are core components in many biologically active natural and synthetic compounds including approved drugs. Herein, an easy&#8208;to&#8208;access and TM&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step synthesis of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;aroyl&#8208;5&#8208;sulfonamide substituted benzo[b]furans bearing many functional groups of different electronic and steric nature using thioamides (as a 2C synthon) and N&#8208;tosylbenzoquinone imine (as a CCO unit partner) at room temperature in open air is presented for the first time. The reaction proceeds via deprotonation/Michael addition/cyclization/aromatization cascades forming two new (C&#63743;C and C&#63743;O) bonds and one ring, liberating only H2S as a byproduct. High resolution mass spectrometry study endorses the key intermediates involved during reaction, validating excellent regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity. This protocol will not only provide an efficient and scalable method to access diverse benzo[b]furans that could be adaptable to late&#8208;stage functionalization but also enrich the research domain of thioamides.

A photochemical aerobic oxidation protocol using a benzothioxanthene imide as the photocatalyst at a low catalyst loading (0.01&#8201;mol%) is developed for the oxidation of boronic acids and esters.

Herein, a sustainable and eco&#8208;friendly protocol is reported for the aerobic photochemical oxidation of boronic acids or esters, utilizing a dibenzothioxanthene imide as the photocatalyst at a very low catalyst loading (0.01%) in 2&#8208;propanol, employing a 456&#8201;nm irradiation source.

Synthesis of 2&#8208;iminothiazolines derived from sulfoxonium ylides is disclosed. The method overcomes current limitation of substrate scope. An array of useful functionalities is tolerated under reaction conditions.

A method is reported which allows for a three&#8208;component cyclization of sulfoxonium ylides, aryl isothiocyanates, and amines to yield 2&#8208;iminothiazolines. The method overcomes the limitation from the scope&#8208;of&#8208;substrate perspective. Success relies on the use of nickel(II) bromide, presumably acting as a Lewis acid catalyst. Investigation of substrate scopes reveals the compatibility of an array of useful functionalities.

         <title>Influence of Levulinoyl Protecting Groups on Glycosylation Stereoselectivity and Glycosyl Cation Structure</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 44, November 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of levulinoyl protecting groups on the glycosylation stereoselectivity and glycosyl cation structure is studied for galactose and mannose building blocks.

The stereoselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;cis glycosidic bonds is historically challenging, and a common synthetic approach is based on the participation of remote protecting ester groups. Common intermediates of glycosylation reactions are glycosyl cations, whose structures are difficult to characterize. Here, the glycosylation reactions and structure of the glycosyl cations of galactose and mannose are investigated when protected with levulinic acid (Lev) at C4 and/or C6, respectively. The glycosyl cations can be assigned to rearranged structures as a consequence of ring opening, as well as dioxolenium ions that suggest remote participation. Some evidence for the long&#8208;range interaction of the Lev keto group is found as previously proposed, which could explain unusual solution&#8208;phase stereoselectivities observed.

&lt;p&gt;The influence of levulinoyl protecting groups on the glycosylation stereoselectivity and glycosyl cation structure is studied for galactose and mannose building blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stereoselective synthesis of 1,2-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; glycosidic bonds is historically challenging, and a common synthetic approach is based on the participation of remote protecting ester groups. Common intermediates of glycosylation reactions are glycosyl cations, whose structures are difficult to characterize. Here, the glycosylation reactions and structure of the glycosyl cations of galactose and mannose are investigated when protected with levulinic acid (Lev) at C4 and/or C6, respectively. The glycosyl cations can be assigned to rearranged structures as a consequence of ring opening, as well as dioxolenium ions that suggest remote participation. Some evidence for the long-range interaction of the Lev keto group is found as previously proposed, which could explain unusual solution-phase stereoselectivities observed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Family of Methylene&#8208;Bridged Fully Functionalized Polynitroarenes and Tetrazole&#8208;Based Energetic Materials</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 44, November 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of methylene&#8208;bridged fully functionalized polynitroarenes and tetrazole&#8208;based energetic materials is reported. This approach enables the modification of the energetic properties of polynitroarenes by mono&#8208; and tricationic salt formation.

Herein, to fine&#8208;tune the energetic properties of 2,4,6&#8208;trinitrobenzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;diamine/diol, these are combined with tetrazole via a methylene bridge. This strategy unlocks the tunability of polynitroarenes performances via salt formation, which is restricted in directly C&#63743;N connected polynitroarenes and azole derivatives. The amino/hydroxy functionalities between the nitro groups on the benzene ring provide extensive inter&#8208; and intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions, contributing to improved stability, whereas the tetrazole ring increases the nitrogen percentage and energetic performance. Due to the presence of one and three labile protons in the amino derivative (compounds 4) and hydroxy derivative (compounds 5), respectively, a series of mono&#8208; and tricationic salts are prepared to further fine&#8208;tune the overall performances. Among all the synthesized compounds, the tricationic energetic salt 10 (Dv&#8201;=&#8201;8135&#8201;m&#8201;s&#8722;1, IS&#8201;&gt;&#8201;40&#8201;J) exhibits energetic performance comparable to TATB and is insensitive. All the compounds are characterized through infrared spectroscopy, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, elemental analysis, and high&#8208;resolution mass spectra studies. The relationship between structure and properties is further explored using Hirshfeld surface, noncovalent interaction, Localized Orbital Locator (LOL)&#8208;&#960;, and electrostatic potential analysis.

         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free strategy has been developed for the construction of highly fluorinated biphenyls through SNAr of potassium perfluorobenzoates with polyfluoroarenes. This operationally simple protocol proceeds through an operationally simple protocol and offers broad substrate scope, providing a practical alternative to traditional cross&#8208;coupling approaches.

Highly fluorinated biphenyls are valuable motifs in various applications. Traditional methods for their synthesis often require expensive catalysts, harsh conditions, and sensitive reagents. Herein, a practical, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free strategy for the synthesis of highly fluorinated biphenyls is reported via nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) between potassium perfluorobenzoates and polyfluoroarenes. This method through an operationally simple protocol, using bench&#8208;stable nucleophiles, enabling efficient access to structurally diverse biphenyls. It offers broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and operational simplicity, providing an alternative to existing methods.

         <title>Electrochemical Annulation/Thiolation of o&#8208;Vinylphenyl Isocyanides with Diorgano Disulfides to Access 2&#8208;Sulfenylquinolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An eco&#8208;friendly procedure for the synthesis of a series of 2&#8208;organosulfenylquinolines was developed by the electrochemical annulation/sulfenylation of o&#8208;vinylphenyl isocyanides with diorgano disulfides. The transformation occurred in good to excellent yields under mild conditions, avoiding the use of a noble metal catalyst and a large amount of oxidants.
Owing to the excellent biological activities of quinolines and organic chalcogenides, organosulfenylquinolines, which contain both sulfur and quinolinones, may have potential biological activity. To solve the existing problems for their generation, an electrochemical annulation/thiolation of o&#8208;vinylphenyl isocyanides with diorgano disulfides to give 2&#8208;sulfenylquinolines is reported. As compared to previous methods, this procedure has the advantages of mild reaction conditions, good substrate applicability, and environmental friendliness.

         <title>Acylsilanes for Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Reversed&#8208;Polarity Synthesis of Diaryl Ketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diaryl ketones are important structural motifs in various fields. Although synthetic methods for preparing diaryl ketones have been developed, we present a reversed&#8208;polarity palladium&#8208;catalyzed reaction between acylsilanes and diaryliodonium salts as a versatile alternative synthetic approach. This strategy enables the efficient synthesis of functionalized diaryl ketones, exhibiting broad synthetic utility and good functional group compatibility.

Diaryl ketones are versatile building blocks widely utilized in pharmaceuticals, materials science, and synthetic chemistry. Due to their structural importance and utility, many synthetic studies have been reported. Traditionally, diaryl ketones have been prepared via Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation, even though this method suffers from limited functional group tolerance under acidic conditions. More recently, transition&#8208;metal catalyzed strategies have emerged, typically involving the coupling between carbonyl electrophiles and organometallics. As an alternative, we report the reversed&#8208;polarity synthesis of diaryl ketones using acylsilanes as carbonyl nucleophilic coupling partners in the presence of palladium catalyst. Inspired by our previous work on the synthesis of imines using imidoylsilanes, diaryliodonium salts were chosen as electrophilic partners. During optimization, the use of CsF was found to be essential, likely due to fluoride&#8208;mediated activation of acylsilanes and facilitation of the transmetalation. Various functionalized diaryl ketones, including more complex derivatives bearing tetrahydrotetramethylnaphthalene (TMN) moieties, were successfully synthesized using this method, demonstrating the synthetic utility.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208; and Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#63743;H Bond Allylation of 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;Indoles With Vinylcyclopropanes</title>

We have developed Ru(II)&#8208; or Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H allylation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;indole with vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs), 2&#8208;vinyl&#8208;ethylene oxide, and 2&#8208;vinylaziridine, synthesizing a series of indole scaffolds. This is the first report of allylation of 3H&#8208;indole with VCPs.

The Ru(II)&#8208; and Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H/C&#63743;C bond activation and subsequent allylation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;indoles with vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs), 2&#8208;vinyl&#8208;ethylene oxide, and 2&#8208;vinylaziridine are reported, enabling the expedient preparation of a wide spectrum for indole derivatives. This transformation proceeds using a cascade sequence involving C&#63743;H bond activation, C&#63743;C bond cleavage of VCPs, and 1,2&#8208;migratory alkene insertion.

         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced regioselective C8 arylation of quinolinones has been achieved through a dual transition metal and photoredox catalytic strategy, affording the desired products in yields up to 85%.

A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated regioselective C8 arylation of quinolinones has been developed by merging transition&#8208;metal catalysis with photoredox catalysis. This approach offers broad substrate scope and mild reaction conditions, affording the desired products in up to 85% yield. Furthermore, to investigate the reaction mechanism, several control experiments were performed, including fluorescence quenching studies, quantum yield measurements, light&#8208;on/off experiments, kinetic isotope effect (KIE) analysis, and H/D labeling experiments. This strategy exhibits excellent scalability and also enables subsequent C2 alkenylation.

         <title>Chemoselective Divergence via Substrate Control: Decarboxylative and Decarbonylative Coupling of 2&#8208;Oxoacids with Allylic Difluorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic method for the decarboxylative C&#63743;C coupling of 2&#8208;oxoacids and allylic difluorides has been developed, yielding monofluoroalkenes in excellent yields. The reaction tolerates both aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;oxoacids and displays high functional group tolerance. With primary alkyl and aryl 2&#8208;oxoacids, acyl radicals are formed and perform addition on the allylic difluoride. Alternatively, when secondary and tertiary alkyl substituents are used, the acyl radical intermediate may undergo further decarbonylation, generating alkyl radicals that form alkylated monofluoroalkenes upon addition. A mechanistic rationale for the competitive decarboxylation/decarbonylation cascade is provided through both experimental and computational data.

Herein, we report the photocatalytic decarboxylative coupling of allylic difluorides and carbon&#8208;centered radicals, which are formed from 2&#8208;oxoacids. This mild and operationally simple protocol enables selective synthesis of monofluoroalkenes via defluorinative C&#63743;C bond formation. Primary and aryl 2&#8208;oxoacids undergo direct acyl radical addition to allylic difluorides, yielding acylated products exclusively. In contrast, secondary 2&#8208;oxoacids afford mixtures of acylated and alkylated products, while tertiary 2&#8208;oxoacids selectively deliver alkylated products via a decarboxylative/decarbonylation cascade. Thus, the product distribution can be tuned by the substitution pattern of the 2&#8208;oxoacids. The rate of decarbonylation versus radical addition is based on the stability and reactivity of the radical intermediates formed. Computational studies confirm a substrate&#8208;dependent divergence in reaction pathways, with primary 2&#8208;oxoacids undergoing direct acyl radical addition, while secondary and tertiary substrates exhibit competing decarbonylation leading to alkylated products. This study therefore establishes a mechanistic rationale for competitive acylation/alkylation processes starting from 2&#8208;oxoacids.

         <title>Preparation of Se(IV) Aryltrifluoromethylselenide Dichlorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient synthesis of dichloro(aryl)(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;&#955;4&#8208;selanes via chlorination of aryl trifluoromethylselenides with SO2Cl2 is reported. The compounds were fully characterized and their stability studied. Density functional theory studies reveal an asynchronous concerted, exergonic pathway, while formation of the Se(VI) derivative is both kinetically and thermodynamically unfeasible.

Trifluoromethylselenide dichlorides are rare selenium(IV) derivatives that have received limited attention despite their potential in organoselenium chemistry. We report a straightforward and efficient synthesis of dichloro(aryl)(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;&#955;4&#8208;selanes (ArSeCl2CF3) via chlorination of aryl trifluoromethylselenides in acetonitrile as the solvent of choice. After evaluating various chlorinating agents, sulfuryl chloride (SO2Cl2) revealed to be very efficient in a broad scope of substrates. Complementary density functional theory calculations provided mechanistic insight, indicating that chlorination proceeds via an asynchronous concerted mechanism with an accessible activation barrier and is exergonic, readily leading to the formation of Se(IV) fluorinated compounds. In contrast, the formation of the Se(VI) tetra&#8208;chlorinated derivative via oxidative addition of Cl2 to the Se(IV) derivative was found to be both kinetically and thermodynamically infeasible.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Polysubstituted Tetrahydrofurans/Tetrahydropyrans via Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Desulfurative Tandem Cyclization Between Thiols and 1,6&#8208;Enynes</title>

         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free, visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoredox&#8208;catalyzed tandem cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes 1 with thiols 2 has been developed. This process efficiently produces polysubstituted tetrahydrofurans 3 and tetrahydropyrans 5 in good yields with excellent regioselectivity via a desulfurative/cyclization/hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) cascade.

We have developed a metal&#8208;free, visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoredox&#8208;catalyzed tandem cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes 1 with thiols 2, enabling the efficient synthesis of polysubstituted tetrahydrofurans 3 in good to excellent yields with high regioselectivity. This transformation proceeds via a desulfurative/cyclization/hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) cascade. Notably, when 1,6&#8208;enynes 4 featuring a phenyl group at the terminal alkene position are employed as substrates, the reaction shifts to afford six&#8208;membered tetrahydropyran derivatives 5, demonstrating excellent substrate&#8208;controlled regioselectivity. This metal&#8208;free protocol exhibits broad functional group tolerance, a wide substrate scope, and high bond&#8208;forming efficiency, while remaining amenable to gram&#8208;scale synthesis.

         <title>Modular Assembly of Cyclic Sulfones via Radical Annulation with Unactivated Olefins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modular assembly of cyclic sulfones was achieved with structurally diverse sulfonylmethyl bromides and unactivated olefins under photoredox conditions. A radical relay mechanism was proposed according to detailed mechanistic studies, with function of additives, including diisopropylethylamine and sodium iodide, fully addressed. The products could be transformed into various bioactive compounds, including three representative drug&#8208;like molecules.

Cyclic sulfones have been recognized as valuable motifs in drug discovery, serving as conformational constraints, hydrogen&#8208;bonding acceptors and electron&#8208;withdrawing functionalities. Synthetic routes such as sulfide oxidation and intramolecular cyclization involving SO2 typically require preconstructed starting materials, limiting structural diversity. Moreover, intermolecular cyclizations toward cyclic sulfones using readily available reagents such as olefins remain scarce, and divergent and modular approaches have yet to be established. Here we report direct and tunable synthesis of cyclic sulfones from radical annulation with a broad range of unactivated olefins and sulfonylmethyl bromides via photoredox catalysis. Mechanistic studies indicate that the transformation proceeds through a radical relay cyclization process initiated by addition of highly electrophilic sulfonylmethyl radical to olefins. The utility of this method is further demonstrated through concise synthesis of three bioactive molecules bearing essential cyclic sulfone architectures.

         <title>Synthetic Studies Toward Rubioncolin B</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report synthetic studies toward rubioncolin B (1), a heptacyclic naphthohydroquinone dimer with antitumor activity. The intermolecular [4&#8201;+&#8201;2]&#8208;cycloaddition between an ortho&#8208;naphthoquinone methide and a naphthofuran derivative led to the construction of a hexacyclic skeleton. Subsequent Wittig reaction and cyclization furnished a cyclic acetal with the same ring structure as 1, providing a versatile platform for diverse analogs.

Herein, we report our synthetic studies toward rubioncolin B (1), a heptacyclic naphthohydroquinone dimer with antitumor activity. Our strategy is based on the intermolecular [4&#8201;+&#8201;2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction between an ortho&#8208;naphthoquinone methide (o&#8208;NQM), which is generated in situ from a 1&#8208;naphthol derivative under catalytic Lewis acid conditions, and a naphthofuran derivative, thereby enabling the construction of a hexacyclic compound. We then explored three synthetic approaches for appending the remaining ring structure to the hexacyclic compound. Among them, the sequence involving the introduction of a Wittig reagent and subsequent cyclization proved effective, furnishing a cyclic acetal with the same ring structure as 1. This strategy not only demonstrates that accessing the highly congested architecture of 1 is feasible but also provides a versatile platform for the synthesis of structurally diverse analogs, thereby facilitating subsequent biological investigations, including structure&#8211;activity relationship studies.

         <dc:description>
A new and effective method for synthesizing C3&#8208;arylated imidazopyridines from 2&#8208;amino pyridines via a two&#8208;step reaction involving nucleophilic substitution, internal imine formation, and aromatization has been developed. This catalyst and solvent&#8208;free method provides a practical advantage of broad substrate scope and good to excellent yields.

A convenient new synthetic strategy was discovered for the synthesis of C3&#8208;arylated imidazopyridines through alkylation of benzyl bromides with 2&#8208;aminopyridines and base&#8208;mediated condensation with diethyl oxalate. A series of C3&#8208;arylated imidazopyridines was obtained in moderate to good yield. This protocol has the advantages of a mild reaction condition, broad substrate scope, and the absence of catalyst or additives.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature C(sp2)&#63743;N Bond Formation Using Pd, Cu, and Ni Catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article presents the conceptual and perspective summaries on Pd, Cu, and Ni metal&#8208;mediated C&#8211;N bond formation, which will be beneficial for future organic chemists to emphasize room temperature C(sp2)&#8211;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions to improve process economy, safety, and environmental friendliness. It also elaborates on the development of transition metal catalysis for these cross couplings, from its early reports in 1983 to the most recent advancements up to 2025. Furthermore, it highlights the synthetic and biological applications of this field.

Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8211;N cross&#8208;coupling is a vital strategy in organic synthesis, enabling the efficient formation of N&#8208;aryl amines as key intermediates in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and biologically active molecules. Precise control of reaction temperature is critical, as it significantly influences both product yield and the formation of byproducts. Conducting C(sp2)&#8211;N cross&#8208;coupling at room temperature offers notable advantages, including cost&#8208;effectiveness, enhanced safety, and reduced environmental impact. This review summarizes literature from 1983 to 2025, highlighting transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8211;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions and primarily involving palladium, copper, and nickel catalysts performed under mild, room&#8208;temperature conditions. The review underscores the broad utility of these reactions across medicinal, agricultural, and industrial domains.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Hydrophosphorylation of Alkynes: Straightforward Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Access to Six&#8208;Membered Phosphorus Heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ready access to six&#8208;membered phosphorus heterocycles through copper&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydrophosphorylation of ortho&#8208;alkynyl secondary phosphine oxides is described. The reaction proceedes with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.

An atom&#8208;economic copper&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydrophosphorylation of ortho&#8208;alkynyl secondary phosphine oxides, using Cs2CO3 as a base, is reported. This innovative synthetic strategy proceeds under mild conditions, and enables regio&#8208; and stereoselective access to six&#8208;membered 1,4&#8208;oxaphosphinines oxides via an anti 6&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization pathway, affording good to excellent yields.

         <title>Synthesis of Antibacterial C16 Cis&#8208;Unsaturated Fatty Acids by Transfer Semihydrogenation of Long&#8208;Chain Alkynes Catalyzed by Palladium&#8211;Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine Carbene Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
The transfer semihydrogenation of long&#8208;chain alkynyl alcohols catalyzed by Pd&#8211;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine carbene (IPC) PEPPSI&#8208;type complexes, along with the subsequent derivatization of the resulting alkenyl alcohols into the corresponding fatty acids, was investigated. The electronic properties of the carbene, modulated by IPC substituents, enhanced catalytic activity. Additionally, the antibacterial properties of the synthesized fatty acids against Staphylococcus aureus were evaluated.

The synthesis of C16 cis&#8208;unsaturated fatty acids was investigated using Pd&#8211;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine carbene (IPC) pyridine&#8208;enhanced precatalyst preparation stabilization and initiation (PEPPSI)&#8208;type complexes as catalysts. These complexes efficiently promote the transfer semihydrogenation of long&#8208;chain alkynyl alcohols. The electronic properties of the carbene, modulated by IPC substituents, influence the &#960;&#8208;accepting character of the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. The resulting cis&#8208;alkenyl alcohols are readily converted into C16 cis&#8208;unsaturated fatty acids. Antibacterial evaluation against Staphylococcus aureus reveals that the position of the double bond is crucial for biological activity.

         <title>Cesium Carbonate&#8208;Mediated Cascade Cyclization for the Efficient Synthesis of Fused Benzo[b]naphthooxepinone Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient base&#8208;mediated intramolecular cyclization of (3&#8208;(acetylphenoxy)prop&#8208;1&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzaldehydes affords fused benzo[b]naphthooxepine derivatives is developed. Further, this protocol provides a great opportunity for the preparation of various benzo[b]naphthooxepine in good yields.

An efficient base&#8208;promoted synthetic approach has been developed for the synthesis of benzo[b]naphthooxepinones from (3&#8208;(acetylphenoxy)prop&#8208;1&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzaldehydes. The transformation proceeds via a base&#8208;mediated 7&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization, followed by intramolecular aldol condensation and subsequent dehydration, resulting in the formation of a fused tricyclic ring system. This one&#8208;pot protocol affords a series of benzo[b]naphthooxepinone derivatives in moderate to good yields, offering a concise and environmentally benign route to these polycyclic scaffolds.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis and Applications of Thiocarbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines synthetic strategies for preparation of thiocarbonyl derivatives, including thioketones, thioamides, thioesters, dithiocarbamates, and isothiocyanates, through both catalytic and noncatalytic methods. It emphasizes their importance in the synthesis of biologically active drug compounds and natural products.

In recent years, thiocarbonyl compounds containing carbon&#8211;sulfur double&#8208;bond organic compounds (C&#63742;S) possess unique structural and electronic properties that differentiate them from the well&#8208;studied carbonyl compounds (C&#63742;O). Their polarized C&#63742;S bond enhances their reactivity toward electrophiles and nucleophiles, making them valuable synthetic intermediates in organic transformations. These thiocarbonyl compounds readily participate in cycloaddition chemistry, radical, substitution, elimination, and addition reactions and serve as versatile building blocks in preparing various sulfur&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds. The thiocarbonyl functional group is formed from carbonyl compounds through the use of phosphorus pentasulfide (P2S5 and dimer P4S10), H2S, and the most common reagent, i.e, Lawesson's reagent. They find medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry applications where thiocarbonyl compounds exhibit various biological activities. Over the years, they have been explored as antiviral, anticancer, antibacterial, and antituberculosis agents and as treatments for hyperthyroidism. This article discusses recent developments in modern synthesis (2019&#8211;2025), reactivity, stability, and bio and material science applications of thiocarbonyl compounds, highlighting their increasing significance in sustainable chemistry and the development of novel therapeutics and novel optical materials.

         <title>Crucial Role of Oxidation for the Prebiotic Peptide Elongation Promoted by Carbonyl Sulfide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prebiotic activation of amino acid (AA) into peptides via N&#8208;carboxyanhydride (NCA), promoted by carbonyl sulfide (COS), cannot proceed without an oxidizing step (enabling better leaving groups than sulfur dianion). While being efficient even at mild pH the prebiotic scope of COS promoted activation of AA, it is however limited because side reactions on amide species hinder peptide elongation.

Both the emergence and sustainability of dissipative chemical systems, such as protometabolisms, require a constant flow of free energy, which can, among other possibilities, be provided by chemical activating agents. Several prebiotically plausible candidates have been identified, but none are flawless or even sufficiently efficient to consider this question resolved. This study revisits and extends previous work on amino acid activation and peptide elongation promoted by carbonyl sulfide in aqueous medium which proceeds via the formation of N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (NCAs). Through an approach aimed at providing new mechanistic insights, it demonstrates that oxidation of the thiocarbamate adduct is mandatory for subsequent NCA and peptide bond formation and that ferricyanide, as an oxidizing agent example, efficiently promotes the reaction even at mild pH. However, side reactions, such as urea/hydantoin formation, were confirmed to strongly limit the prebiotic scope of this N&#8208;terminal peptide elongation route.

         <title>Cyclopropyl for Gem&#8208;Dimethyl: Synthesis and Olfactory Properties of Linear Musks with Cyclopropyl Spacers**</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fusing the gem&#8208;dimethyl groups into a cyclopropyl ring in the spacer of linear alicyclic musk odorants subtly changes the molecular geometry and polarity of the target structures while the musk odour is retained or even intensified.

Linear musks with cyclopropylmethyl spacers in place of 2&#8208;methylpropyl spacers were designed, synthesised and evaluated olfactorily.

After deprotection and esterification with various short&#8208;chain carboxylic acids, their qualitative olfactory evaluation revealed that fusing the gem&#8208;dimethyl groups into a cyclopropyl ring retains and even intensifies the musk scent. Methylation of the cyclopropyl ring however completely erases not only the distinct musk character but virtually any odour.

         <title>Mechanochemical Alkynylation of Isatin with Calcium Carbide: Experimental and Computational Insights into Selectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of isatin, CaC2, and KOtBu in dimethylsulfoxide has been reported to afford mono&#8208;alkynylation products, whereas we found that under the mechanochemical conditions, the bis&#8208;alkynylation pathway is preferred. In this work, we investigated this transformation experimentally and computationally, both in solution and under mechanochemical conditions, to elucidate the factors governing the selectivity switch.

Alkynylation of isatins with calcium carbide (CaC2) in solution has been reported to selectively yield mono&#8208;alkynylation products (i.e., 3&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles). In this work, we studied the reaction under mechanochemical conditions, finding that upon ball milling, the acetylenic anions [C2]2&#8211; present in CaC2 react with isatin, leading preferentially to the bis&#8208;alkynylation addition product [i.e., 3&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;bis(3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole)]. Through experimental work and computational mechanistic studies within the framework of density functional theory, we investigated the change in selectivity and identified i) the highly concentrated reaction environment under ball milling and ii) the avoidance of bulk water as conditions that favor the bis&#8208;alkynylation of two isatin molecules with a single [C2]2&#8211; fragment. In addition, we found that the reaction occurs through several variants of the same overall mechanism, in which some cationic metal counterions play a relevant role through noncovalent interactions.

         <title>Defective NiO Nanoparticles Supported on Nb2O5 for Solid&#8208;Catalyzed Markovnikov&#8208;Selective Hydroboration of Styrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiO deposited on Nb2O5 was an efficient catalyst for Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydroboration of styrenes using B2(pin)2. The catalytically active species were NiO on Nb2O5 and leached Ni species. The coexistence of ZnO served as a redeposition site for the leached Ni species, improving the reusability of the catalyst system.

Markovnikov selective hydroboration of alkenes with an air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable diboron reagent is a more challenging reaction than the anti&#8208;Markovnikov&#8208;selective one. We report that nickel oxide (NiO) supported on niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5) efficiently catalyzed the hydroboration of 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylstyrene, affording a Markovnikov (branched) adduct with excellent selectivity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydroboration of styrenes with a diboron reagent, bis(pinacolato)diboron, using a solid catalyst. NiO on Nb2O5 contains Ni3+, which is more catalytically active than Ni2+, as a major species in contrast to bulk NiO. However, the catalytic activity decreased upon recycling tests because the Ni species leached from NiO/Nb2O5. The catalytically active species were NiO on Nb2O5 and leached Ni species. To improve the reusability of the catalyst system, NiO/Nb2O5, ZnO was introduced as a redeposition site for the leached Ni species. Ultimately, the desired Markovnikov adduct was obtained in high yield and selectivity using NiO/Nb2O5 in the presence of ZnO (92% yield and 92% selectivity), and catalyst reusability was also improved.

         <title>Synthetic Strategies to Access Fluorinated Azoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent synthetic strategies for introducing fluorine groups (mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and trifluoromethylation) into 11 major azole classes, identifying research gaps to inform future innovations in materials science, medicinal chemistry, and biomedical research.

Incorporating fluorine into azoles is not only a common practice but also an essential tactic in medicinal chemistry, due to their ability to fine&#8208;tune a molecule's physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles. The strategic introduction of fluorine into nitrogen&#8208;containing five&#8208;membered heterocycles can significantly enhance metabolic stability, membrane permeability, and binding affinity&#8212;key factors in modern drug development. This review provides an up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of key synthetic strategies for monofluorination, difluoromethylation, and trifluoromethylation across 11 prominent azoles: 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles, 1,2,4&#8208;triazoles, tetrazoles, pyrazoles, imidazoles, pyrroles, isoxazoles, oxazoles, thiazoles, thiadiazoles, and isothiazoles. This review aims to identify current limitations in the field and delineate existing research gaps that present further opportunities for innovation in these domains, which are essential for propelling pharmaceutical and biomedical research. By integrating new synthetic advancements and diverse strategies to access them, this review aims to serve as both a practical guide and a source of inspiration for chemists exploring the next generation of fluorinated azole pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Dihydropyranones through Cyclization and Organometallic Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable method for synthesizing 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydropyran&#8208;2&#8208;ones (MeO&#8208;DHP&#8208;2&#8208;ones) via base&#8208;promoted cyclization of hydroxy alkynes is presented. Mechanistic and computational studies guided the transformation into 4,5&#8208;dihydropyran&#8208;4&#8208;ones (DHP&#8208;4&#8208;ones), enabling access to spiroacetal precursors relevant to natural product synthesis.

Dihydropyranones are key structural motifs in biologically active polyketides. We report a reproducible and scalable method for synthesizing 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydropyran&#8208;2&#8208;ones (MeO&#8208;DHP&#8208;2&#8208;ones) via base&#8208;promoted cyclization of hydroxy alkynes. Mechanistic and computational studies revealed that water content and reaction time critically influence lactonization efficiency. Two optimized protocols &#8211; using potassium carbonate (K2CO3) or in situ generated sodium methoxide (MeONa) &#8211; enabled consistent yields across multiple substrates. Cyclization in deuterated methanol provided deuterium&#8208;enriched DHP&#8208;2&#8208;one scaffolds with high isotopic incorporation, valuable for mechanistic and medicinal applications. The transformation of DHP&#8208;2&#8208;ones into 4,5&#8208;dihydropyran&#8208;4&#8208;ones (DHP&#8208;4&#8208;ones) was achieved via organometallic addition followed by a tailored workup involving aqueous hydrochloric acid and boron trifluoride diethyl etherate (BF3&#183;OEt2). This protocol proved robust and scalable, compatible with both organolithium and organomagnesium reagents, although the latter afforded lower yields. Mechanistic analysis highlighted key steps including hemiacetal formation, oxonium activation, and controlled hydrolysis. The methodology enables multigram&#8208;scale preparation of both DHP&#8208;2&#8208;one and DHP&#8208;4&#8208;one scaffolds and provides a streamlined route toward spiroacetal precursors.

         <title>Photocatalysis 1,6&#8208;Addition for Site&#8208;Selective Alkylation of para&#8208;Quinone Methides (p&#8208;QMs) via Amidyl Radical 1,2&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild photocatalytic protocol synthesizes diverse diarylmethane derivatives (39 examples, good yields) via 1,2&#8208;HAT of N&#8208;benzoyloxyamides generating carbon radicals, followed by selective coupling with para&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs).

Under light irradiation, a novel photocatalytic reaction between para&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) and N&#8208;benzoyloxyamides has been developed to synthesize substituted diarylmethane derivatives, which exhibit potential biological activities. This reaction proceeds under mild conditions, affording 39 compounds with good yields and broad substrate applicability. Mechanistic studies reveal that N&#8208;benzoyloxyamides undergo 1,2&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (1,2&#8208;HAT) to generate carbon&#8208;centered radicals, which subsequently undergo selective radical&#8211;radical coupling with p&#8208;QMs to form the diarylmethane framework.

Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;mucocin isolated from Rollinia mucosa (Annonaceae) was achieved. Stereoselective construction of the tetrahydropyran (THP) ring moiety was performed using diastereoselective oxypalladation. The tetrahydrofuran (THF) ring moiety was prepared from (S)&#8208;(&#8211;)&#8208;malic acid. The cross&#8208;metathesis reaction between the THP and THF moieties afforded the nonadjacent THP&#8211;THF core part. Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling of the &#947;&#8208;lactone portion with the THP&#8211;THF core part followed by reduction of the enyne and removal of the protecting groups afforded (&#8722;)&#8208;mucocin.

         <title>Electrochemically Promoted Aminothiocyanation of Unactivated Alkenes for the Synthesis of Thiocyanated Pyrrolidines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiocyanated pyrrolidines were synthesized from unactivated alkenes by aminothiocyanation under mild electrochemical conditions. This method features broad substrate scope, excellent selectivity, and enables late&#8208;stage thiocyanation of bioactive molecules.

We report herein an electrochemical aminothiocyanation protocol for the synthesis of thiocyanated pyrrolidines from unactivated alkenes. This method exhibits mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, excellent regioselectivity, and can be applied for late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecules. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction might proceed via a sulfonium ion pathway.

         <title>Reagent&#8208;Controlled Total Synthesis of Natural Anti&#8208;Inflammatory (&#8208;)&#8208;Berkeleyamide A and its Seven Stereoisomers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reagent&#8208;driven efficient stereoselective total synthesis of anti&#8208;inflammatory (&#8208;)&#8208;berkeleyamide A, and its unnatural congeners was developed by nonnucleophilic bulky base&#8208;mediated asymmetric aldol reaction from Meldrum's acid.

The total synthesis of anti&#8208;inflammatory (&#8208;)&#8208;berkeleyamide A (with an overall yield of 40%) and its seven stereoisomers was accomplished from inexpensive Meldrum's acid. The reagent&#8208;controlled KOtBu&#8208;mediated syn&#8208;aldol adduct (&gt;76% yield and&#8201;&gt;90% diastereoselectivity) afforded the natural (10S, 11R,14S)&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;berkeleyamide A. Notably, an exclusive anti&#8208;aldol adduct, formed via LiHMDS/TMEDA&#8208;mediated aldol reaction, produced (10S, 11S,14S)&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;11&#8208;epi&#8208;berkeleyamide A as a single crystal. While the use of LDA and NaHMDS yielded both syn&#8208; and antiadducts, enabling access to all stereoisomers. The required aldol partners, chiral &#947;&#8208;lactam and aliphatic aldehyde, were both produced from Meldrum's acid in 3&#8208; and 5&#8208;step sequences, respectively, with high yields (each step &gt;87%). The 2D NMR studies and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic data assisted in assigning the stereochemistry of all the stereoisomers.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Investigations of Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Chemo&#8208;, Regio&#8208;, and Stereoselective cis&#8208;Hydroboration of 1,3&#8208;Enynes</title>

         <dc:description>
A detailed mechanism supported by kinetic experiments, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and X&#8208;ray crystallography is proposed for the chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective hydroboration of 1,3&#8208;enynes. Hydrocupration was determined to be the turnover&#8208;limiting step and essential for selectivity. An off&#8208;cycle, cyclic CuHBpinOAc complex is proposed to explain a positive fractional rate order in catalyst.

The mechanistic details of the chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective cis&#8208;hydroboration of 1,3&#8208;enynes were investigated using X&#8208;ray crystallography, kinetic analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The kinetic analysis revealed that the reaction is first order in enyne, zeroth order in HBpin, and fractional order in the catalyst. Our studies suggest that a cyclic CuHBpinOAc complex is an off&#8208;cycle species (via DFT analysis) that contributes to the experimentally observed fractional rate order regarding the catalyst. Experimental and computational data suggest that hydrocupration is rate&#8208;limiting and essential for achieving selectivity.

Naphthalene Diimide&#8208;Based Small&#8208;Molecule Semiconductors Enabling Air&#8208;Stable n&#8208;Type Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>

Two novel small molecule semiconductors with low&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals were designed and synthesized for ambient&#8208;stable organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) with over 97% electron mobility retained after 2 weeks&#8217; storage in ambient conditions. Flexible OFETs fabricated via air&#8208;water interfacial self&#8208;assembly achieve electron mobility of 4.49&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;3 and 7.21&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;3&#8201;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.

The development of ambient&#8208;stable n&#8208;type organic semiconductors is a critical yet challenging research frontier. Herein, we report a rational molecular design by functionalizing naphthalene diimide (NDI) cores with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing termini via thiophene bridges. Density functional theory calculations revealed enhanced planarity and significantly lowered lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals energy level (&lt;&#8722;4.1&#8201;eV), which were corroborated by photophysical and electrochemical analyses. The solution&#8208;processed organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) demonstrated electron mobilities over 10&#8722;3&#8201;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, all of which were fabricated and measured under ambient conditions. Remarkably, the devices retained&#8201;&gt;97% performance after 2&#8208;week storage in ambient conditions. Furthermore, to evaluate the potential of the semiconductors for flexible electronics applications, we fabricated flexible OFETs by integrating the self&#8208;assembled NDI&#8208;4X (X&#8201;=&#8201;F, Cl) thin films prepared via air&#8208;water interfacial self&#8208;assembly. Also under ambient conditions, the devices exhibited higher electron mobilities of 4.49&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;3 (NDI&#8208;4F) and 7.21&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;3&#8201;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1(NDI&#8208;4Cl) than their halogen&#8208;free counterpart NDI&#8208;4H (1.14&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;3&#8201;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). This work demonstrates that introducing strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups at both ends of electron&#8208;deficient units provides an effective pathway to achieve ambient&#8208;stable n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule semiconductors, thereby enabling their application in next&#8208;generation, ambient&#8208;operating flexible organic electronics.

         <title>Synthesis and Physicochemical Characterization of 2&#8208;Azabicyclo[3.2.0]heptane Building Blocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An expedient multigram synthesis of diastereopure 2&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.0]alkane&#8208;derived building blocks is developed by sequential construction of the cyclobutane and pyrrolidine rings by ketene [2+2] cycloaddition and lactam formation, respectively. The title scaffold is characterized by measurements of physicochemical and structural parameters supported by exit vector plot analysis to evaluate its potential for isosteric replacement in medicinal chemistry.

A convenient approach to the synthesis of diastereopure 6&#8208; and 2,6&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.0]hexanes is reported. The method is based on the sequential construction of the cyclobutane and pyrrolidine rings of the target bicyclic system via [2+2] ketene cycloaddition and lactam formation, respectively. Although the key cycloaddition step had modest stereoselectivity (dr 2:1), the target bicyclic product could be obtained as a pure diastereomer without using chromatographic purification. The reaction sequence commences from readily available starting materials and is easily scalable (up to 32.8&#8201;g). Utility of the synthesized intermediates is demonstrated by the preparation of a series of exo&#8208; and endo&#8208;isomeric amino alcohols and monoprotected diamines&#8212;valuable building blocks for drug discovery. Their potential for isosteric replacements is evaluated by measuring physicochemical properties, as well as structural studies and exit vector plot analysis.

         <title>From Light&#8208;Driven to Dark Synthesis: Streamlining Perfluoroalkyl Selenide Ether Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two orthogonal and user&#8208;friendly protocols enable the efficient construction of (Se/S)&#63743;RF bonds from simple dichalcogenides and perfluoroalkyl iodides. Visible&#8208;light irradiation at 395&#8201;nm promotes seleno&#8208; and thioether formation, while a dark KOH/MeCN variant delivers selenoethers in minutes. Both approaches operate under mild, metal&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions, tolerate biologically relevant substrates, and scale smoothly to gram quantities.

Two complementary and operationally simple methods enable the efficient perfluoroalkylation of organodiselenides: (i) direct visible&#8208;light irradiation at 395&#8201;nm in aqueous MeCN with RF&#8211;I, requiring no photocatalyst, and (ii) a base&#8208;promoted protocol using KOH in MeCN under dark conditions. Both furnished perfluoroalkyl selenoethers in excellent yields, while only the photoinduced protocol delivered good to excellent yields of perfluoroalkyl thioethers from organodisulfides. The direct irradiation approach also enables the preparation of Se&#8208; and S&#8208;perfluoroalkylated derivatives of selenocysteine and cysteine, highlighting the applicability to biologically relevant substrates. Both protocols feature excellent chemical selectivity, good functional group tolerance, mild conditions, and simple operation. Compared with existing photocatalytic and thermal methods, these approaches provide greater versatility and operational simplicity, exemplified by the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of a perfluoroalkyl selenoether in excellent yield.

         <title>Recent Advances in Iron&#8208;Photocatalyzed Decarboxylative C&#63743;C Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent progress in photoinduced iron&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative C&#63743;C bond formation using alkyl carboxylic acids and their derivatives as radical precursors. It emphasizes the mechanistic insights, substrate versatility, and synthetic utility of this environmentally benign strategy, highlighting its potential for constructing complex molecules and its growing impact in modern organic synthesis.

In recent years, iron&#8208;photocatalyzed decarboxylative C&#63743;C bond formation has emerged as a sustainable and versatile strategy in synthetic chemistry. This approach harnesses earth&#8208;abundant and cost&#8208;effective iron complexes, which undergo ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer under visible&#8208;light irradiation to generate alkyl radicals directly from readily available carboxylic acids. The resulting radical intermediates participate in diverse C&#63743;C bond&#8208;forming processes, including alkyl&#8722;alkyl, alkyl&#8722;aryl, and alkyl&#8722;alkenyl couplings, enabling rapid access to structurally complex scaffolds from simple feedstock chemicals. In this perspective review, recent progress in substrate scope, catalytic design, and mechanistic understanding, is highlighted with particular emphasis on synthetic applications in late&#8208;stage functionalization and pharmaceutical intermediate construction. These advances not only underscore the unique reactivity of iron photocatalysts but also point toward future opportunities for expanding their utility in green and scalable C&#63743;C bond&#8208;forming methodologies.

One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Ferrocene Thioamides from Ferrocenecarboxaldehyde via the Willgerodt&#8211;Kindler Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of ferrocene thioamides is synthesized via Willgerodt&#8211;Kindler reaction from ferrocenecarboxaldehyde. Two experimental protocols are developed to effectively employ both primary and secondary amines. The solvent screening reveals a highly positive effect of amide solvent on the reaction. Mechanistic study helps to elucidate the role of Na2S as promoted rather than the catalyst.

Ferrocene thioamides are potential alternatives for classical oxoamide&#8208;type ferrocene ligands with broad applications in metal&#8208;catalyzed transformations as well as substrates for C&#63743;H activations and applications in other fields. A reaction of ferrocenecarboxaldehyde with various amines and sulfur promoted by sodium sulfide furnishes a wide range of ferrocene thioamides via the Willgerodt&#8211;Kindler multicomponent reaction. The detailed solvent screening reveals that amide&#8208;type solvents are highly beneficial for the reaction. The steric hindrance of bulky amine substrates limits the reaction. While secondary amines require only conventional heating, primary amines yield better results with microwave irradiation at higher temperatures. The mechanism is investigated using nuclear magnetic resonance kinetic measurements, which show that Na2S acts as a promoter, rather than a catalyst, of the reaction.

&lt;p&gt;A series of ferrocene thioamides is synthesized via Willgerodt&#8211;Kindler reaction from ferrocenecarboxaldehyde. Two experimental protocols are developed to effectively employ both primary and secondary amines. The solvent screening reveals a highly positive effect of amide solvent on the reaction. Mechanistic study helps to elucidate the role of Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S as promoted rather than the catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferrocene thioamides are potential alternatives for classical oxoamide-type ferrocene ligands with broad applications in metal-catalyzed transformations as well as substrates for C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H activations and applications in other fields. A reaction of ferrocenecarboxaldehyde with various amines and sulfur promoted by sodium sulfide furnishes a wide range of ferrocene thioamides via the Willgerodt&#8211;Kindler multicomponent reaction. The detailed solvent screening reveals that amide-type solvents are highly beneficial for the reaction. The steric hindrance of bulky amine substrates limits the reaction. While secondary amines require only conventional heating, primary amines yield better results with microwave irradiation at higher temperatures. The mechanism is investigated using nuclear magnetic resonance kinetic measurements, which show that Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S acts as a promoter, rather than a catalyst, of the reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vicinal Pyrazolyl&#8208;Phosphine Imines and their Palladium Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrazolyl phosphines bearing a vicinal aminal group are synthesized and hydrolyzed to formyl derivatives and cyclic phosphonium salts, with product ratios depending on HCl concentration. The corresponding methylimines act as bidentate ligands forming Pd(II) complexes, while phosphonium salts afford a Pd(IV) complex confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography.

Readily available 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;5&#8208;(N,N,N&#8242;&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;N&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)diamino&#8208;methyl)pyrazoles are employed as starting materials for the synthesis of pyrazolyl phosphines. Subsequent hydrolysis yields the expected 4&#8208;diphenylphosphino&#8208;5&#8208;formylpyrazoles, accompanied by the formation of cyclic phosphonium salts. The product distribution is found to depend on the concentration of hydrochloric acid: higher acid concentrations favored the formation of cyclic phosphonium salts. A similar behavior is observed for the methylimines derived from 4&#8208;diphenylphosphino&#8208;5&#8208;formylpyrazoles. These imines acted as bidentate ligands, readily forming palladium(II) complexes. In contrast, the cyclic phosphonium salts reacted with dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) to afford a palladium(IV) complex, the structure of which is confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography.

         <title>Toward Novel Trifluoromethylated Peptidomimetics: A Case Study of Cathepsin C Inhibitors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of CF3&#8208;containing amino acid analogues is prepared and studied by docking to Cathepsin C. The results highlight their potential as peptidomimetics and showcase the value of fluorination in drug design.

Herein, both synthetic and theoretical results related to the development of amino acid analogues containing a CF3&#8208;olefinic moiety and their evaluation as potential inhibitors of Cathepsin C are presented. The key synthetic steps include the trifluoromethylation using the Ruppert&#8211;Prakash reagent and a Horner&#8211;Wadsworth&#8211;Emmons olefination to obtain the desired CF3&#8208;alkenyl amino acid derivatives. In recent years, theoretical approaches based on molecular docking have gained significant attention for predicting the biological activity of synthetic compounds as enzyme inhibitors. The research specifically targets Cathepsin C, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase I, a protease that plays a crucial role in activating various degradative enzymes involved in tissue damage during inflammatory diseases.

         <title>Convenient Synthesis of C&#8208;Linked &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Galactosides with Lipophilic Aglycone Component Toward Lectin A Inhibition and Antibiofilm Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an ESKAPE pathogen, relies on lectin A (LecA) for adhesion, biofilm formation, and virulence making it a promising therapeutic target. Hydrolytically stable novel C&#8208;linked monovalent D&#8208;galactosides A, B, and C with lipophilic aglycone component are synthesized using Weinreb&#8208;amide&#8208;based building block 15 and are evaluated for bacterial biofilm inhibition activity.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a member of the World Health Organization&#8208;listed ESKAPE pathogens, exhibits high drug resistance and relies on the galactose&#8208;specific lectin LecA for adhesion, biofilm formation, and virulence. Targeting lectin A (LecA) emerges as a promising antivirulence strategy. While multivalent D&#8208;galactoside derivatives demonstrate strong LecA binding and biofilm disruption, their high molecular weight, synthetic complexity, and poor pharmacokinetic profiles limit clinical potential. In contrast, monovalent &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;galactosides with aromatic aglycons offer improved drug&#8208;likeness and bioavailability, though typically with moderate potency. The hydrophobic pocket adjacent to LecA's binding site inspires lipophilic modifications to enhance activity, yet most inhibitors remain O&#8208; or S&#8208;linked glycosides. C&#8208;linked &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;galactosides, which are hydrolytically more stable, remain underexplored. Motivated by their potential advantages, the design and synthesis of hitherto unreported monovalent C&#8208;linked &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;galactoside ligands with aryl aglycones, represented by general structures A, B, and C, is proposed as new LecA inhibitors for combating P. aeruginosa biofilm.

         <title>Electrocatalytic C&#63743;H Annulation of Alkynes to Functionalized Heterocycles: Synthesis and Mechanical Insights</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical C&#63743;H annulation of alkynes represents a sustainable and efficient pathway for constructing functionalized heterocycles. This work highlights, how alkyne integration enables the creation of nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;containing scaffolds with adaptable features for pharmaceuticals, materials, and catalysis. Integrating transition&#8208;metal and metal&#8208;free electrocatalysis, this overviews the selective and eco&#8208;friendly routes for redefining heterocycle synthesis through controlled alkyne activation.

Heterocyclic frameworks are indispensable in pharmaceuticals, advanced materials, and catalysis owing to their diverse structures and wide&#8208;ranging functionalities. In recent years, electrochemical C&#63743;H annulation using alkynes has emerged as a green and selective platform for the efficient construction of these complex systems. By avoiding stoichiometric oxidants and enabling reagent&#8208;free processes, this methodology reduces environmental impact while improving synthetic efficiency. Alkyne incorporation plays a pivotal role in modulating the electronic and biological properties of nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;rich heterocycles, which are prominent in bioactive compounds. Innovations in electro&#8208;oxidative processes and transition&#8208;metal catalysis have significantly advanced the field, allowing for precise and sustainable transformations. Herein, the synthesis of functionalized heterocycles employing annulation of alkynes electrocatalytically, role of catalysts, and mechanistic insights are overviewed by critically investigating the recent progress in crafting next&#8208;generation heterocyclic scaffolds with functional versatility.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Catalyzed C3&#8211;H Sulfinylation of Indoles with Sulfenamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes an efficient iodine&#8208;catalyzed C3&#8211;H sulfinylation of indoles, employing sulfenamides as sustainable sulfur sources under transition&#8208;metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions.

Organic sulfides, particularly 3&#8208;sulfinylindoles, have garnered substantial attention owing to their remarkable pharmacological activities and broad applications in materials science and pesticide chemistry. Nevertheless, traditional synthetic approaches for 3&#8208;sulfinylindoles usually suffer from drawbacks such as toxic reagents, dependence on transition&#8208;metal catalysts, and severe reaction conditions. Herein, an iodine&#8208;catalyzed C3&#8211;H sulfinylation strategy is presented for the synthesis of 3&#8208;sulfinylindoles, employing sulfenamides as stable and odorless sulfenylating reagents. This protocol proceeds under mild conditions (100&#8201;&#176;C in 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane) without extra oxidants or additives, delivering a broad range of 3&#8208;sulfinylindole derivatives in moderate to excellent yields. Substrate scope investigations demonstrate excellent compatibility with indoles having electron&#8208;donating/withdrawing groups and sulfenamides containing aromatic/heterocyclic groups. This method addresses critical challenges in traditional sulfinylation, providing a green, metal&#8208;free, and efficient approach for the construction of thiofunctionalized indole derivatives with potential applications in drug discovery and functional materials.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated 2&#8208;Arylindoles with High Quantum Yields and Tunable Spectroscopic Features</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New &#960;&#8208;conjugated 2&#8208;arylindole&#8208;based fluorophores bearing (hetero)aryleneethynylene units and a pendant ester group are prepared. These show high fluorescence quantum yields (up to 94%) and solvatochromic effects. The ester moiety allows easy access to other functional groups, such as an N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide whose reactivity can be exploited for proteins and antibodies bioconjugation.

Indole&#8208;based fluorophores represent a promising class of fluorescent probes due to their tunable optical properties, structural versatility, and compatibility with biological systems. In this work, the design, synthesis, and photophysical characterization of a new series of 2&#8208;arylindole derivatives functionalized with (hetero)aryleneethynylene units and a pendant ester group are reported. The compounds are synthesized via Fischer indole synthesis followed by Sonogashira coupling, enabling also the introduction of electron&#8208;donating (&#8211;NMe2) and electron&#8208;withdrawing (&#8211;CN) substituents. Furthermore, they are decorated with an N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimidyl (NHS) moiety for facile bioconjugation. Spectroscopic studies conducted in solvents of varying polarity reveal strong solvatochromic effects, high fluorescence quantum yields (up to 94%), and emission wavelengths spanning the blue to green region. Selected derivatives are successfully conjugated to bovine serum albumin, thanks to the NHS reactive group. Photophysical measurements of the resulting protein conjugates reveal that the fluorophores remain solvent&#8208;exposed, maintaining their emission profiles in aqueous media&#8212;an important feature for potential bioimaging and sensing applications. These findings highlight the utility of indole&#8208;based scaffolds for the development of environmentally responsive fluorescent probes.

         <title>Salt&#8208;Free CatAnionic Vesicular Nanoreactor from Dithiocarbamate: Michael Addition of Nitroolefins in Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A salt&#8208;free CatAnionic vesicular nanoreactor is developed from dithiocarbamate amphiphiles via a simple one&#8208;step synthesis. These self&#8208;assembled vesicles catalyze aqueous Michael additions with high efficiency, enable one&#8208;pot transformations, and demonstrate reusability and recyclability, providing a sustainable approach for organic synthesis and pharmaceutical intermediate preparation.

The salt&#8208;free CatAnionic vesicle is previously generated by mixing cationic and anionic amphiphiles and removing the salt that occurred as a byproduct from the mixture. In this study, a new strategy to produce the salt&#8208;free CatAnionic vesicle of N,N&#8208;dialkylammonium N,N&#8208;dialkyldithiocarbamate (AmDTC) is reported through a one&#8208;step condensation between secondary amine and CS2. The AmDTC dispersed in water, resulting in the spontaneous formation of salt&#8208;free CatAnionic vesicles. Among several AmDTCs, the N,N&#8208;didodecylammonium N,N&#8208;didodecyldithiocarbamate (AmDTC&#8208;C12) showed high stability and is applied as a vesicular nanoreactor for the Michael addition in water. These vesicles catalyzed aqueous Michael additions of nitroolefins, affording 23 adducts in 65%&#8211;92% yields. The vesicles enabled preparative&#8208;scale and one&#8208;pot Michael addition by in&#8201;situ generation of AmDTC&#8208;C12 vesicle afforded the Michael adducts also in good yields. The AmDTC&#8208;C12 vesicular nanoreactor is applied for the synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;baclofen with 54% yields over three steps. Reusability of the AmDTC&#8208;C12 is demonstrated and allowed the reuse up to seven cycles. Finally, chemical recycling of N,N&#8208;didodecylamine precursor is demonstrated by converting AmDTC&#8208;C12 to N,N&#8208;didodecylammonium chloride salt by simple acidification. Owing to their simple precursors and mild synthesis, salt&#8208;free CatAnionic vesicles from AmDTC show promising and untapped potentials as organocatalysts and delivery applications.

Finally, chemical recycling of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-didodecylamine precursor is demonstrated by converting &lt;b&gt;AmDTC-C12&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-didodecylammonium chloride salt by simple acidification. Owing to their simple precursors and mild synthesis, salt-free CatAnionic vesicles from AmDTC show promising and untapped potentials as organocatalysts and delivery applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical strategy has been developed for the nickel&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of cyano esters derived from phenol, as electrophilic substrates using arylboronic acids via Csp2&#63743;O bond cleavage.

A mechanochemical strategy has been developed for the nickel&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of cyano esters derived from phenols, as electrophilic substrates using arylboronic acids via Csp2&#63743;O bond cleavage. This approach capitalizes on the abundance of phenols, using cyano&#8208;functionalized derivatives to enable high reactivity and functional group compatibility without halogenated reagents. The reaction is carried out under solvent&#8208;free, temperature&#8208;trace conditions, significantly reducing environmental impact. The methodology offers a sustainable and scalable alternative for biaryl synthesis, with implications for pharmaceutical and material sciences.

         <title>A Practical and Scalable Synthesis of Cyclized and Uncyclized Xanthene&#8208;1,8&#8208;Dione Derivatives Using Cyanuric Chloride as a Green Organocatalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical and eco&#8208;friendly approach for the synthesis of 1,8&#8208;dioxo&#8208;octahydroxanthene derivatives is described, employing water as the sole solvent under mild, metal&#8208;free conditions. This versatile protocol delivers both uncyclized and cyclized products with good to excellent yields, broad substrate scope, and superior green chemistry metrics with low E&#8208;factor, making it a valuable contribution to sustainable synthetic methodologies.

A mild, water&#8208;mediated protocol has been developed for the synthesis of both uncyclized and cyclized 1,8&#8208;dioxo&#8208;octahydroxanthene derivatives under ambient conditions. Utilizing cyclic&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds and structurally diverse aromatic or heteroaromatic aldehydes, the transformation proceeds efficiently with cyanuric chloride (TCT) as a green organocatalyst. The reaction conditions are finely tunable, allowing selective access to either uncyclized intermediates or cyclized products by adjusting time and temperature, thereby enabling modular control over product outcomes. The protocol also demonstrates excellent compatibility with isatin derivatives, yielding spirooxindolo xanthenedione frameworks in high yields. Substrate scope evaluation revealed broad functional group tolerance, with several products displaying notable biological activities, including anticancer, antibacterial, and antileishmanial properties. All synthesized compounds are fully characterized using spectroscopic techniques such as 1H, 13C, and mass spectroscopy. A detailed, plausible mechanism for the transformation has also been proposed and discussed. Comprehensive green metrics, including atom economy, E&#8208;factor, process mass intensity, and other metrics, are calculated for each cyclized derivative. Gram&#8208;scale experiments further confirmed the scalability and environmental sustainability of this operationally simple, metal&#8208;free, and energy&#8208;efficient protocol.

         <title>Role of Quantum Tunneling in Synthetic Organic Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum mechanical tunneling, an alternative reaction pathway to the classical thermal one, is rarely considered in organic synthesis. However, there is growing evidence of its profound impacts, for example, in limiting access to target molecules or determining reaction outcomes. This article highlights recent exemplary studies and explores how concepts like tunneling control and instability can inform synthesis design and optimization.

Quantum mechanical tunneling offers an alternative dynamical pathway to the classical (thermal) overcoming of energetic barriers, by penetrating these barriers instead. Recent years have shed light on its impact on organic synthesis in terms of kinetics, reaction outcomes, and lifetimes (and thus feasibility) of reactive intermediates or supposedly stable products. This concept article summarizes recent computational and experimental studies and illuminates how the insights from these studies, for example, regarding the concepts of tunneling control and instability, should inform synthesis design and optimization.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Convergent Synthesis of Heterocyclic Compounds via C&#63743;H Activation/Cyclization: An Overview and Summary Toward Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current progress in tandem C&#63743;H activation reactions involving terminal alkynes. It predominantly covers the synthesis of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered heterocycles, as well as fused heterocycles, with an emphasis on specific topics, including purely chemical synthesis, electrochemical synthesis, and enantioselective synthesis.

The development of one&#8208;step transformations to heterocyclic compounds would considerably boost the synthetic efficiency in organic chemistry. In recent years, numerous examples of the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed (TMC) C&#63743;H activation/annulation strategy have been reported. Despite remarkable progress achieved with internal alkynes, allenes, and alkyne surrogates, terminal alkynes remain challenging substrates. Due to their relatively acidic terminal protons, terminal alkynes easily undergo alternative homocoupling reactions under commonly used oxidative conditions, exhibiting significant difficulties in C&#63743;H functionalizations. To date, the C&#63743;H activation involving terminal alkynes remains one of the most promising and appealing areas in organic synthesis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current progress in tandem C&#63743;H activation reactions with terminal alkynes. With a strong emphasis on the catalysis of Rh and Co transition metals, it predominantly covers the synthesis of five&#8208;, six&#8208;membered heterocycles, and fused heterocycles. In this protocol, specific topics, such as purely chemical synthesis, electrochemical synthesis, and enantioselective synthesis, mechanistic details associated with the documented reactions are discussed. In addition, a tactical user guidance for terminal alkynes&#8208;participated C&#63743;H activation is also put forward.

         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H bond functionalization protocol for 1&#8208;naphthylamine derivatives is reported, enabling efficient and regioselective synthesis of 8&#8208;benzylated 1&#8208;naphthylamides directly from aryl aldehydes via benzylic C&#63743;H activation. Utilizing a bidentate directing group strategy, the reaction exhibits broad substrate tolerance with good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. The methodology effectively combines photochemical reactivity with Pd catalysis in a flow microreactor setup, facilitating the capture and use of short&#8208;lived reactive intermediates.

Herein, a continuous photo&#8208;flow protocol for quinolinamide&#8208;directed regioselective C&#8208;8 benzylation of 1&#8208;naphthylamine derivatives via C&#63743;H bond functionalization with flow&#8208;generated aryldiazomethanes is reported. A wide range of 8&#8208;benzylated&#8208;1&#8208;naphthylamide products are afforded in satisfactory yields upon palladium catalysis via a bidentate directing process under illumination by 12&#8201;W blue light&#8208;emitting diodes (450&#8201;nm). This mild, simple, and convenient synthetic method allows a wide range of easily handled aryl aldehydes, without the exclusion of either moisture or oxygen. This transformation is environmentally friendly and operationally simple, and it can be easily scaled up to the gram scale with good selectivity. Finally, an improved protocol for C&#63743;H functionalization is described, which relies on the use of a continuous&#8208;flow photo&#8208;microreactor.

This mild, simple, and convenient synthetic method allows a wide range of easily handled aryl aldehydes, without the exclusion of either moisture or oxygen. This transformation is environmentally friendly and operationally simple, and it can be easily scaled up to the gram scale with good selectivity. Finally, an improved protocol for C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H functionalization is described, which relies on the use of a continuous-flow photo-microreactor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Greener Approach to 2,5&#8208;Furandicarboxylate Macrocycles and their Entropically Driven Ring Opening Polymerization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid&#8208;based polymers are obtained through the entropically driven ring&#8208;opening polymerization of the corresponding macrocyclic oligoesters (MCOs). MCOs are synthesized using cyclopentyl methyl ether as a green solvent and purified without column chromatography. Properties of the resulting polyesters are evaluated and compared between the different techniques.

Thermoplastic polyesters (PEs), with their versatile properties, are indispensable in everyday life. However, increasing concerns about the environmental impact of fossil&#8208;based polymers have driven research into renewable alternatives. Among bio&#8208;based polymers, furan&#8208;derived PEs such as poly(ethylene furanoate) (PEF) have garnered significant attention. The synthesis of PEF, as well as other similar 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA)&#8208;based polymers, is mainly based on bulk polycondensation (PC) that in general requires elevated temperatures and low pressure, making the process energy&#8208;intensive and vulnerable to thermo&#8208;oxidative degradation. In this view, entropically driven ring opening polymerization (ED&#8208;ROP) might represent an interesting potential alternative since it requires milder conditions and is intrinsically more atom economic. From these premises, this work focuses on developing an alternative synthetic strategy to bio&#8208;based PEs through ED&#8208;ROP of macrocycles derived from FDCA dimethyl ester (FDME). These macrocycles were prepared by reacting FDME with diols via pseudo&#8208;high dilution condensation (PHDC) using dibutyltin(IV) oxide as a catalyst and cyclopentyl methyl ether as a recyclable green solvent. Isolation of the pure macrocycles is achieved by simple crystallization from the reaction mixture. Subsequent ROP of pure macrocycles is investigated as a viable route to prepare the related PEs in mild reaction conditions.

The parent 5,5&#8242;&#8208;binaphtho[2,1&#8208;d]isoxazole and its 3,3&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl and 3,3&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl derivatives are synthesized via condensation of the respective dicarbonyl compounds with hydroxylamine, followed by cyclodehydration of the resulting dioximes. The dicarbonyl precursors are obtained through 4&#8208; or 6&#8208;step sequences from 1&#8208;naphthol or 1&#8208;naphthaldehyde, involving oxidation, methylation, demethylation, coupling, bromination, formylation, esterification, and Fries rearrangement.

[1,1&#8242;&#8208;Binaphthalene]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diol (BINOL) analog, [1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;diol, obtained by direct oxidative coupling of 1&#8208;naphthol, is acylated to [1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;diyl diacetate and then rearranged by the Fries reaction to 1,1'&#8208;{4,4'&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;[1,1'&#8208;binaphthalene]&#8208;3,3'&#8208;diyl}bis(ethan&#8208;1&#8208;one). Incorporation of aldehyde groups at the 3,3' positions of [1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;diol required oxidative coupling of 1&#8208;methoxynaphthalene to 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene, bromination, formylation, and demethylation. Incorporation of benzoyl groups at the 3,3' positions of [1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;diol required subjecting either 1&#8208;(4&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;naphthyl)(phenyl)methanone to the Ullmann reaction conditions or 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene to the Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction with benzoyl chloride. The 1,1&#8242;&#8208;(4,4&#8242;&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;diyl)dicarbonyls are converted to the corresponding dioximes, which then underwent cyclodehydration to the respective novel 5,5'&#8208;binaphtho[2,1&#8208;d]isoxazoles.

A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced tandem cyclization of vinyl isocyanides with diaryl disulfides or 1,2&#8208;dialkyldiselanes has been realized for the first time. The reaction provides an environmentally friendly method for the synthesis of 1&#8208;thio/selenoisoquinolines from the easily available starting materials in a single step.

Isoquinoline compounds, especially 1&#8208;substituted derivatives, have garnered considerable attention due to their ubiquitous presence in natural products and pharmaceuticals. Herein, a novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced tandem cyclization of vinyl isocyanides with diaryl disulfides or 1,2&#8208;dialkyldiselanes has been developed. The reaction tolerates a wide range of substrates and provides an environmentally friendly route to the synthesis of 1&#8208;thio/selenoisoquinolines from the easily available starting materials in a single step.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel three&#8208;component strategy for the synthesis of valuable 3,4&#8208;disubstituted pyrroles from easily available propargylamines, tosylmethyl isocyanide, and water in the presence of DBU has been developed.

A novel three&#8208;component van Leusen strategy has been developed for the efficient and straightforward synthesis of valuable 3,4&#8208;disubstituted pyrroles from easily available propargylamines, tosylmethyl isocyanide, and water. This transformation advances through the formation of a pyrrole framework via [3&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition with tosylmethyl isocyanide and a sequential nucleophilic substitution, ring&#8208;opening, and deprotonation/protonation cascade process. This reaction provides a convenient modular access to pyrrole derivatives with aryl and benzoyl groups through the formation of three new bonds and one heterocycle from readily available acyclic precursors in a single step.

Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Distal C&#63743;H Functionalization of 8&#8208;Aminoquinolinamides: Facile Synthesis of Triarylmethane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manuscript reports a chelation&#8208;induced remote C&#63743;H functionalization of 8&#8208;aminoquinolinamides with p&#8208;quinone methides as alkylating agents. The method enables efficient coupling across diverse quinolinamides, demonstrating broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance.

Herein, a straightforward approach is reported for the palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative remote C&#63743;H alkylation of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline derivatives using para&#8208;quinone methides. This method enables selective C5&#8208;alkylation of quinolines and exhibits a site&#8208;selectivity distinct from that typically observed in convetional palladium&#8208;catalyzed sp2 C&#63743;H activation. The reaction proceeds via chelation&#8208;induced remote C&#63743;H functionalization, and a broad range of quinolinamides are successfully coupled with p&#8208;quinone methides, demonstrating excellent substrate scope and functional group tolerance. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest a reversible C&#63743;H metalation step as part of the catalytic cycle.

         <title>1,2&#8208;Sulfonylative&#8208;Arylation of Acrylamides via Strain&#8208;Release&#8208;/Aromaticity&#8208;Driven Radical Generation and SO2&#8208;Capture under Photoredox Catalysis to Access S(VI)&#8208;Oxindoles</title>

         <dc:description>
1,2&#8208;Sulfonylative&#8208;arylation of N&#8208;phenyl acrylamides has been achieved under visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis conditions. Strained 3&#176;&#8208;cyclopropanols and 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;DHPs are exploited to trigger the acrylamide bisfunctionalization in the presence of SO2 for accessing S(VI) functionalized oxindoles bearing a &#946;&#8208;all&#8208;carbon quaternary center in moderate to good yields.

&#947;&#8208;Keto sulfones, despite being a medicinally relevant building block, have never been integrated with the bioactive oxindole scaffold present in several alkaloid natural products. On the other hand, strategies involving SO2 capture in organic molecules to access value&#8208;added products are gaining momentum. Therefore, a strategy en route to &#947;&#8208;keto alkylsulfonylated oxindoles bearing a &#946;&#8208;all&#8208;carbon quaternary center is disclosed. Toward this goal, the bisfunctionalization of N&#8208;(hetero)arylacrylamides has been realized via the strain&#8208;release driven ring&#8208;scission of strained 3&#176;&#8208;cyclopropanols in the presence of DABSO under visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis to access a library of &#947;&#8208;keto alkylsulfonylated oxindoles. Also, the aromaticity&#8208;driven bond&#8208;scission in pro&#8208;aromatics like 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;DHPs in the presence of Na2S2O5 under visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis has been exploited to trigger the alkylsulfonylative&#8208;arylation of N&#8208;(hetero)arylacrylamides to access a library of alkylsulfonylated oxindoles featuring a &#946;&#8208;all&#8208;carbon quaternary center. Broad substrate scope is demonstrated, and the mechanistic probing studies have been complemented with DFT calculations. Also, moderate to potent cytotoxic activity is observed against the tested triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cell lines for some of the synthesized sulfonylated oxindole derivatives. Further, evaluation of the mechanism of cell death for the most potent oxindole analog revealed that it induces apoptosis in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner.

         <title>Discovery of Some New Heterocyclic Systems from Carbene&#8208;Based Reactions of Indigo and N&#8208;Methyl Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accessing new heterocyclic structural space on exposure of indigo&#8208;based substrates to carbene or carbenoid reactive intermediates is the key focus of this work. A number of unprecedented heterocyclic products have been discovered and their structures characterized. Mechanistic comment on the possible cascade processes leading to the products is also presented.

Reactions of N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethylindigo with dichlorocarbene or rhodium carbenoids have been investigated leading to the one&#8208;pot production of new, complex heterocyclic derivatives. One of these arises from an overall ring interconversion process with ring expansion to afford a novel eight&#8208;membered ring&#8208;fused benz[6,7][1,5]oxazocino[3,2&#8208;b]indol&#8208;13&#8208;one derivative. Alternatively, an overall ring construction process gives rise to an unprecedented spirocyclic 2H,4H&#8208;spiro[furo[3,2&#8208;b]indole&#8208;3,2&#8242;&#8208;indoline] system. A number of products with an embedded 6H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;a:3,4&#8208;b&#8242;]diindole core from reaction with a rhodium malonyl ester carbenoid intermediate are also reported, plus some other carbenoid&#8208;derived products. A solvent dependence is apparent with these reactions. Reaction path differences are also seen using N&#8208;methylindigo or the parent indigo as the substrate and possible mechanisms are proposed.

         <title>Fast Nucleophilic Approach to Exhaustively Substituted Porphyrin Derivatives at the &#8220;Eastern Half&#8221;</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;step procedure including the nitration of simple porphyrinates (Zn2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+ complexes) and very attractive vicarious nucleophilic substitution of hydrogen reaction gives porphyrin derivatives with unique structures, exhaustively &#946;&#8208;substituted in the so&#8208;called &#8220;Eastern half.&#8221; These types of hydrophilic or amphiphilic target products are sought in anticancer photodynamic therapy. It seems they are practically unavailable by any other alternative methods.

meso&#8208;Tetraarylporphyrin chelates (of Zn2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+) are easily available from parent porphyrins. Their reactions with nitric acid (yellow fuming HNO3, d&#8201;=&#8201;1.52, diluted to 25%&#8211;50%), under optimized conditions in CHCl3 at room temperature, can be carried out selectively, thus giving mainly &#946;,&#946;&#8208;dinitro&#8208;substituted moieties (usually two or three isomers of the above complexes). These intermediates (obtained in overall yields of up to 73%), upon the reaction with carbanions bearing a leaving group X at the reactive center, afford the target products, the ones of vicarious nucleophilic substitution (VNS) of hydrogen. This approach allows the synthesis of porphyrin derivatives exhaustively &#946;&#8208;substituted in the so&#8208;called &#8220;Eastern half&#8221;, starting from a simple meso&#8208;tetraarylporphyrins. These types of products are sought in anticancer photodynamic therapy (PDT). Thus, the above two&#8208;step procedure including very attractive VNS reaction gives hydrophilic or amphiphilic moieties that seem to be potential PDT agents with unique structures, being practically unavailable by any other alternative methods.

These types of products are sought in anticancer photodynamic therapy (PDT). Thus, the above two-step procedure including very attractive VNS reaction gives hydrophilic or amphiphilic moieties that seem to be potential PDT agents with unique structures, being practically unavailable by any other alternative methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A metal&#8208;free, mild, facile, and cost&#8208;effective one&#8208;pot hypervalent&#8208;iodine&#8208;mediated transformation was developed for the synthesis of pyridoquinazolinones from 2&#8208;chloropyridines at room temperature. This reported protocol can produce biologically active pyridoquinazolinones in a single step from readily available starting materials.

A mild, cost&#8208;effective, one&#8208;pot, and metal&#8208;free hypervalent iodine&#8208;mediated protocol for the production of pyridoquinazolinones from 2&#8208;aminobenzaldehydes and 2&#8208;chloropyridines at room temperature has been established. This reported procedure can easily produce biologically active pyridoquinazolinones in a one&#8208;pot manner utilizing readily available starting materials. Operational simplicity, moderate reaction conditions, high atom economy, and high yield are some key features of this protocol. The generation of AcOH and HCl as the only by&#8208;products makes this a cost&#8208;effective procedure for the production of pyridoquinazolinones.
