         <title>Visible Light Activated Benzimidazolequinone Alkoxyamines of 1,1,3,3&#8208;Tetramethylisoindolin&#8208;2&#8208;yloxyl (TMIO)</title>

         <dc:description>
The first room&#8208;temperature dissociation of alkoxyamines of TMIO is rationalized by using kinetics experiments, UV&#8208;Vis spectra and DFT&#8208;derived parameters. The visible light activation provides a benign alternative to Nature's bioreductive activation for the generation of potentially chemotherapeutic quinone methides.







Abstract
1,1,3,3&#8208;Tetramethylisoindolin&#8208;2&#8208;yloxyl (TMIO) is a well&#8208;known stable 2,3&#8208;dihydroisoindoline aminoxyl radical, which is thermally generated (at &gt;100&#8201;&#176;C) from literature alkoxyamine derivatives. Herein is the synthesis of visible light activated benzimidazolequinone alkoxyamines of TMIO using oxidative methods and the first room temperature nitroxide&#8208;exchange experiments with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) analogues. For the alkoxyamine TMIO&#8208;Vis dissociation rate constants are provided using TEMPO and oxygen as radical traps.

         <title>Micelle&#8208;Mediated Trimerization of Ynals to Orthogonally Substituted 4H&#8208;Pyrans in Water: Downstream Rearrangement to Bioactive 2,8&#8208;dioxabicyclo[3.3.1]nona&#8208;3,6&#8208;diene Frameworks</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient and environmentally benign protocol has been devised to induce trimerization of ynals to 4H&#8208;pyrans in water. This strategy has been successfully tested on a range of aliphatic, aromatic and hetero&#8208;aromatic substrates. Acid&#8208;mediated rearrangement of 4H&#8208;pyrans to interesting 2,8&#8208;dioxabicyclo[3.3.1]nona&#8208;3,6&#8208;dienes has been also demonstrated. The location of the reaction site in the micelle&#8216;s palisade region was established through proton NMR studies.







Abstract
An efficient trimerization of ynals to diversely substituted 4H&#8208;pyran constructs has been executed in water, under ambient conditions employing micellar catalysis. The method is in agreement with the ideas of green and sustainable chemistry. The locus of the micellar reaction site has been probed through proton NMR studies. A general acid&#8208;mediated downstream rearrangement of the derived 4H&#8208;pyrans to interesting 2,8&#8208;dioxabicyclo[3.3.1]nona&#8208;3,6&#8208;dienes has been observed.

This review summarizes the reaction development of nitriles, including hydration, hydrolysis and reduction reactions both in homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. The characteristics of different catalytic systems are introduced in detail.







Abstract
Nitrile represents a synthetically important class of compounds, relevant to the preparation of fine organic chemicals, natural products, and biologically active molecules. The electronegative nitrogen atom and electropositive carbon atom of cyano group endow nitriles with rich and diverse chemical properties. Traditional chemical transformations of nitriles usually involve the use of strong acids, bases, and other harsh conditions. To overcome these limitations, various catalytic methods have been explored both in homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. In this review, we summarize some of the recent progress on the development of efficient synthetic methods involving nitriles. Especially, the classic transformations of nitriles including hydration, hydrolysis and reduction reactions are discussed in detail, which provide rapid access to a series of important small molecules, such as amides, ketones, amines, and imines. The reaction development, as well as the design of the catalytic system will be discussed with special emphasis placed on the mechanistic aspects.

         <title>Ring Opening and Closure Reactions of &#946;&#8208;Propiolactone in the Superacids HF/MF5 (M=Sb, As)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 48, Page 6628-6635, December 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction behavior of &#946;&#8208;propiolactone in the superacidic systems HF/MF5 (M=Sb, As) depends on the reaction temperature. While temperatures lower than &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C generate the monoprotonated species of 3&#8208;hydroxypropanoyl fluoride, higher temperatures lead to the formation of a cyclic trication. For the formation of both compounds, the existence of an acyl cation is assumed. In order to investigate the reaction pathway of its formation, quantum chemical calculations were performed.







Abstract
Transformations of &#946;&#8208;propiolactone in the binary superacidic systems HF/MF5 (M=Sb, As) were investigated at different temperatures. Salts of monoprotonated 3&#8208;hydroxypropanoyl fluoride [H2O(CH2)2C(O)F][SbF6] (1) and [H2O(CH2)2C(O)F][AsF6] (2) were obtained by performing the reactions at temperatures lower than &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. In contrast, temperatures higher than &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C yield the respective salts [C9H15O6][SbF6]3 (3) and [C9H15O6][AsF6]3 (4) containing a cyclic trication. The protonated species of &#946;&#8208;propiolactone was not observed. All salts were characterized by low temperature Raman and IR spectroscopy. In addition, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analyses were performed for (1) and (3). For both cations the existence of a cationic acyl species as a reactive intermediate in the form of [HO(CH2)2CO][MF6] is assumed. The formation of the acyl cation, based on protonated &#946;&#8208;propiolactone, was investigated by quantum chemical calculations on the MP2/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level of theory.

     alt="Ring Opening and Closure Reactions of &#946;-Propiolactone in the Superacids HF/MF5 (M=Sb, As)"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction behavior of &#946;-propiolactone in the superacidic systems HF/&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;=Sb, As) depends on the reaction temperature. While temperatures lower than &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C generate the monoprotonated species of 3-hydroxypropanoyl fluoride, higher temperatures lead to the formation of a cyclic trication. For the formation of both compounds, the existence of an acyl cation is assumed. In order to investigate the reaction pathway of its formation, quantum chemical calculations were performed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transformations of &#946;-propiolactone in the binary superacidic systems HF/&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;=Sb, As) were investigated at different temperatures. Salts of monoprotonated 3-hydroxypropanoyl fluoride [H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(O)F][SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and [H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(O)F][AsF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) were obtained by performing the reactions at temperatures lower than &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. In contrast, temperatures higher than &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C yield the respective salts [C&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;][SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) and [C&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;][AsF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) containing a cyclic trication. The protonated species of &#946;-propiolactone was not observed. All salts were characterized by low temperature Raman and IR spectroscopy. In addition, single-crystal X-ray analyses were performed for (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). For both cations the existence of a cationic acyl species as a reactive intermediate in the form of [HO(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO][&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] is assumed. The formation of the acyl cation, based on protonated &#946;-propiolactone, was investigated by quantum chemical calculations on the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Bisthienylethene&#8208;Porphyrin Photoswitchable Copolymers</title>

The synthesis of a new diarylethene&#8208;porphyrin photoswitchable copolymer through the electropolymerization of zinc octaethyl porphyrin and pyridine substituted diarylethene is reported. The incorporated diarylethene maintains its reversible photochromism upon exposure to UV&#8208;Vis radiation with multiple cycles of ring opening and closing.







Abstract
The bisthienylethene (BTE) class is one of the most intensely studied type of photochromatic dye which attract great attention from researchers seeking to exploit light responsive switches in an extensive diversity of fields. BTE is the subject of many avenues of research. We report here the synthesis of a new diarylethene&#8208;porphyrin photoswitchable copolymer via the electropolymerization of zinc octaethyl porphyrin and pyridine substituted diarylethene. The electropolymerization was monitored by electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM). The copolymer was characterized by electrochemistry, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The incorporated diarylethene maintains its reversible photochromism upon the UV&#8208;Vis radiation with multiple cycles of ring&#8208;opening and closing. Attention is focused on the ways the polymer environment affects BTE photochromism.

This article reports on a simplified access, completed characterization and confirmed potential of the strongly electron&#8208;impoverished (R)&#8208;6,6&#8242;&#8208;Tf2&#8208;BINOL as a promising chiral scaffold to elaborate activated metal ligands or organocatalysts useful in catalytic enantioselective transformations.







Abstract
The title compound, characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, was accessed in 4 steps with 92&#8201;% ee. and 25&#8201;% yield from an O&#8208;protected (R)&#8208;BINOL precursor. This revised synthetic route relied on a chlorosulfonylation reaction, as a shortcut to a previously developed sequence requiring the use of toxic SO2 gas and bromine. The strongly electron&#8208;impoverished (R)&#8208;6,6&#8242;&#8208;Tf2&#8208;BINOL proved an effective ligand in metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective transformations such as a Zr&#8208;based Mannich&#8208;type reaction. The catalytic species was characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography as a unique tetrameric metal cluster. The 6,6&#8242;&#8208;bistriflone groups also allowed to exalt the H&#8208;bond donor capacity of the BINOL moiety, as illustrated in an organocatalyzed Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman transformation. Theoretical study indicated that the 6,6&#8242;&#8208;bistriflone groups induce a drop of the phenol acidity of 5&#8197;pKa units in DMSO. Overall, this work simplified the access, completed the characterization, and confirmed the potential of (R)&#8208;6,6&#8242;&#8208;Tf2&#8208;BINOL as a promising platform to further elaborate activated chiral metal ligands or organocatalysts.

         <dc:description>
Azaheterocyclic compounds, among others, are of great importance in the pharmaceutical industry and as agrochemicals. Their catalytic synthesis, consequently, is of significant interest. The use of transition metals in combination with suitable chiral ligands has been shown to be an efficient approach for the formation of enantioenriched nitrogen heterocycles of functional diversity. The present minireview collects and discusses recent examples demonstrating the synthetic potential of their chemistry.







Abstract
The aim of the present minireview is to summarize and discuss recent advances in the field of stereoselective synthesis of azacycles. The focus is on studies that appeared in the last two years to illustrate recent trends with a handful of examples from 2019 highlighting an important field of enantioselective chemistry. Results collected and discussed here show that syntheses catalyzed by late transition metals of group 8&#8211;11 afford products in high yield with high stereoselectivity, often under mild reaction conditions thereby demonstrating their efficacy to afford valuable products. Plausible reaction mechanisms for most transformations are also discussed.

The tetramethylammonium&#8208;hydroxide&#8208;catalyzed oxidative coupling of amines and alcohols has been described for the synthesis of several heterocycles under metal&#8208;free conditions by utilizing oxygen from air as the terminal oxidant.







Abstract
We report the tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide catalyzed oxidative coupling of amines and alcohols for the synthesis of imines under metal&#8208;free conditions by utilizing oxygen from air as the terminal oxidant. Under the same conditions, with ortho&#8208;phenylene diamines and 2&#8208;aminobenzenethiols the corresponding benzimidazoles and benzothiazoles were obtained. Quinoxalines were obtained from ortho&#8208;phenylene diamines and 1&#8208;phenylethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diol, the conditions were then extended to the synthesis of quinoline building blocks by reaction of 2&#8208;amino benzyl alcohols either with 1&#8208;phenylethan&#8208;1&#8208;ol or acetophenone derivatives. The formation of C&#8722;N, C&#8722;S and C&#8722;C bonds was achieved under metal&#8208;free conditions. A broad range of amines (aromatic, aliphatic, cyclic and heteroaromatic) as well as benzylic alcohols including heteroaryl alcohols reacted smoothly and provided the desired products. The mild reaction conditions, commercially available catalyst, metal&#8208;free, good functional&#8208;group tolerance, broad range of products (imines, benzimidazoles, benzothiazoles, quinoxalines and quinolines) and applicability at gram scale reactions are the advantages of the present strategy.

A straightforward synthesis of virtually unexplored terminally disubstituted electron&#8208;deficient alkylidene cyclopent&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;4&#8208;ones was elaborated using activated secondary sulfones as alkylidene anion&#8208;radical synthons. The presented olefination process is proposed to rely on a base&#8208;promoted tandem or sequential Michael addition of C&#8208;nucleophiles to 4&#8208;acyl&#8208; or 4&#8208;silyloxycyclopent&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones followed by retro&#8208;Michael O&#8208; and S&#8208;nucleofuges elimination.







Abstract
Herein we report on a simplified synthesis of scarcely explored, terminally disubstituted electron&#8208;poor alkylidene cyclopent&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;4&#8208;ones through uncommon olefination. Secondary sulfones, activated by electron&#8208;withdrawing groups at the adjacent carbon atom, undergo K2CO3&#8208;promoted coupling with 4&#8208;acyloxy&#8208; and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyloxycyclopent&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones giving directly, or after a separate dehydrosulfinylation step, alkylidene cyclopent&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;4&#8208;ones. A plausible mechanism for these transformations is proposed. Initially, &#946;&#8208;arylsulfonyl esters as well as their acetyl or nitrile analogues are allylated by cyclopentenone derivatives via a tandem Michael addition of &#945;&#8208;sulfonyl carbanions followed by proton migration and retro&#8208;Michael&#8208;type O&#8208;nucleofuge elimination. The primary allylation products are formed as two diastereomers whose configuration and conformation were elucidated using single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy. Regardless of stereochemistry, both sets of diastereomers are subjected to Zaitsev&#8208;type retro&#8208;Michael vinylogous dehydrosulfinylation under either basic or thermal silica gel promoted conditions resulting in E/Z&#8208;alkylidene cyclopent&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;4&#8208;ones. In these reactions activated sulfones serve as bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing group alkylidene anion&#8208;radical synthons, whereas 4&#8208;oxy&#8208;substituted cyclopentenones represent cyclopent&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;4&#8208;one cation&#8208;radical surrogates.

Regardless of stereochemistry, both sets of diastereomers are subjected to Zaitsev-type &lt;i&gt;retro&lt;/i&gt;-Michael vinylogous dehydrosulfinylation under either basic or thermal silica gel promoted conditions resulting in &lt;i&gt;E/Z&lt;/i&gt;-alkylidene cyclopent-2-en-4-ones. In these reactions activated sulfones serve as bearing electron-withdrawing group alkylidene anion-radical synthons, whereas 4-oxy-substituted cyclopentenones represent cyclopent-2-en-4-one cation-radical surrogates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

An IPr&#8208;nickel system promotes the arylnickelation of alkyne/Heck cyclization of o&#8208;vinyl chlorobenzenes with internal alkynes to access substituted naphthalenes.







Abstract
An efficient nickel&#8208;catalyzed arylnickelation of alkyne/Heck cyclization of challenging o&#8208;vinyl chlorobenzenes with internal alkynes has been developed. This protocol enables synthesis of a wide variety of substituted naphthalenes in a cascade process from readily available starting materials. Mechanistic studies indicate the radical pathway is not involved in the cascade catalytic system.

         <title>Improved Synthesis of D&#8208;Isoglutamine: Rapid Access to Desmuramyl Analogues of Muramyl Dipeptide for the Activation of Intracellular NOD2 Receptor and Vaccine Adjuvant Applications</title>

Bacterial peptidoglycan subunit &#8211; muramyl dipeptide (MDP) &#8211; activates the innate immune system through the NOD2 receptor. Lipophilic desmuramyl analogues of MDP were synthesized by using a remarkably simple and scalable method, which involves a new strategy for the preparation of d&#8208;isoglutamine fragment of pharmacophoric dipeptidyl moiety. This new approach will help accelerate the development of new immunoadjuvants against bacterial and viral infections.







Abstract
Muramyl dipeptide (MDP) &#8211; the smallest immunomodulatory unit of bacterial peptidoglycan &#8211; has adjuvant activity and triggers the innate immune system against bacterial and viral infections. The inherited drawbacks of MDP, such as pyrogenicity and poor macrophage penetration, can be resolved by structural modifications, thereby improving its pharmacological profile and adjuvant activity. Herein, several desmuramyl analogues of MDP were designed by replacing the carbohydrate fragment (MurNAc) of the parent molecule with an immunomodulatory xanthine scaffold. The L&#8722;D configurations of the pharmacophoric dipeptidyl moiety were conserved and alkyl chains of moderate length were introduced at isoglutamine to enhance their cellular uptake. The synthesis of these analogues features a novel synthetic route for D&#8208;isoglutamine fragment with an overall yield of &gt;50&#8201;% in ten to eleven steps. This sufficiently flexible approach provides rapid access to desmuramyl analogues of MDP on a gram scale, which can help accelerate the development of novel NOD2 agonists and immunoadjuvants.

Thio&#8208;linked analogues of UDP&#8208;sugars, GDP&#8208;mannose and CMP sialic acid that contain an electroneutral alkyl chain to replace the native &#945;&#8208;O&#8208;pyrophosphate or &#8208;phosphate bond were synthesized through radical mediated thiol&#8208;ene coupling reactions. The 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;1&#8208;thiosugars obtained by hydrothiolation of 2&#8208;substituted glycals were coupled to nucleoside 4&#8217;&#8208;exomethylenes or N&#8208;allyl&#8208;morpholinos.







Abstract
Leloir glycosyltransferases play an important role in many fundamental processes of living systems by catalyzing biological glycosylations. Neutral analogues of nucleotide sugars, as potential donor&#8208;substrate inhibitors of Leloir glycosyltransferases, are of prime interest in medicinal chemistry. We report the development of S&#8208;linked sugar&#8208;nucleotide analogues by replacing the &#945;&#8208;O&#8208;pyrophosphate bridge with an electroneutral ethyl or propyl linker by radical mediated hydrothiolation of 2&#8208;substituted glycals and olefinic nucleoside analogues. UDP&#8208;glucose and UDP&#8208;GlcNAc analogues were assembled from 2&#8208;substituted glycals, 1,2&#8208;ethanedithiols and uridine 4&#8217;&#8208;exomethylene derivative by two subsequent thio&#8208;click reactions. Morpholino type mimetics of UDP&#8208;, GDP&#8208; and CMP&#8208;sugars were constructed by photoinitiated additions of 1&#8208;thiosugars (Glc, GlcNAc, Gal, Man) and 2&#8208;thio&#8208;Neu5Ac onto N&#8208;allyl morpholinos.

Triarylmethyl cations catalyze the synthesis of unsymmetrical bisindolylmethanes from imines and two different indoles. Optimization of the catalyst by tuning cation stability allows for excellent single addition selectivity. The single addition intermediates can be isolated or used in&#8197;situ in a high&#8208;yielding one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step reaction to generate unsymmetrical bisindolylmethanes.







Abstract
An efficient synthesis of unsymmetrical bisindolylmethanes has been accomplished using triarylmethyl cations to catalyze the reaction of N&#8208;arylimines with two different indoles. Optimization of the organocatalyst by tuning cation stability allows for excellent single addition selectivity when coupled with p&#8208;nitrophenyl imines. The optimal catalyst is commercially available, and the reaction minimizes waste and environmental impact by employing a one&#8208;to&#8208;one ratio of starting materials. The intermediates can be isolated or used in&#8197;situ in a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step reaction to generate unsymmetrical bisindolylmethanes in high yields. The reaction tolerates a broad range of imines with the highest yields observed for electron&#8208;poor and neutral imines. A wide range of indole nucleophiles are also successfully employed allowing for the creation of a large variety of unsymmetrical bisindolylmethanes.

         <dc:description>
An unprecedented iron/palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling of alkenyl bromides and bromodifluoromethanes with manganese as the reductant has been disclosed. A variety of functional groups was well tolerated, providing various substituted gem&#8208;difluoroallylenes in moderate to good yields. The preliminary mechanism studies ruled out the radical pathway for this new reaction.

Reported herein is an unprecedented dual iron/palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling of alkenyl bromides and bromodifluoromethanes with manganese as the reductant. This methodology leads to the efficient construction of a series of gem&#8208;difluoroallylenes under mild reaction conditions without requiring the addition of stoichiometric amounts of catalyst. Preliminary mechanism investigations indicate that the radical pathway might not be involved in this novel dual transition metal catalyzed reaction.

&lt;p&gt;An unprecedented iron/palladium-catalyzed reductive cross-coupling of alkenyl bromides and bromodifluoromethanes with manganese as the reductant has been disclosed. A variety of functional groups was well tolerated, providing various substituted &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluoroallylenes in moderate to good yields. The preliminary mechanism studies ruled out the radical pathway for this new reaction.

         <title>Double&#8208;Headed Nucleotides with Increased Base&#8208;Pairing Affinity and Specificity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 48, Page 6717-6724, December 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double&#8208;headed nucleotides of arabinouridine featuring 2&#8242;&#8208;methylene linked non&#8208;natural nucleobases with increased stacking potential and charges for electrostatic interaction with the backbone were synthesized and studied in DNA duplexes. All new monomers displayed increased affinity towards DNA compared to the double&#8208;headed nucleotides featuring the natural nucleobases, and the UClU analogue also displayed improved mismatch discrimination.







Abstract
Double&#8208;headed nucleotides, i.&#8201;e., nucleotides that hold two nucleobases each, have been shown to be double&#8208;functional in DNA duplexes by forming two sets of Watson&#8722;Crick base pairs, and thus mimicking dinucleotides. Herein, we present three new double&#8208;headed nucleotides, UT+, UA+ and UClU, with the non&#8208;natural nucleobases 5&#8208;(3&#8208;aminopropynyl)uracil (T+), 7&#8208;(3&#8208;aminopropynyl)&#8208;7&#8208;deazaadenine (A+) and 5&#8208;chlorouracil (ClU) attached to the 2&#8242;&#8208;position of arabinouridine via a methylene&#8208;linker. With extended &#960;&#8208;systems and amino groups for electrostatic interaction with the DNA backbone, incorporation of UT+ and UA+ increased duplex stability compared to their unmodified predecessors, UT and UA. For UT+, discrimination of mismatches was slightly improved compared to UT, whereas this was not the case for UA+. The UClU analogue also increased duplex stability compared to UT and provided better mismatch discrimination than both UT and UT+. Thereby it represents the leading bis&#8208;uracil double&#8208;headed nucleotide analogue.

         <title>Silica&#8208;Mediated Monohydrolysis of Dicarboxylic Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 48, Page 6773-6776, December 28, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In order to outwit statistical distribution, a monoselective silanolysis of dicarboxylic esters at the silica gel surface was chosen as the initial step of the hydrolysis. Thus, a very practical and selective access to carboxylic half esters was developed, suitable for stiff aromatic diesters, as well as flexible aliphatic diesters.







Abstract
A new method for the monohydrolysis of dicarboxylic esters is presented, involving as key step a silanolysis at elevated temperatures at the silica gel surface. In the second step, the surface bound silyl esters are cleaved off under mild conditions, giving a straightforward and fast access to half esters. Based on recovered starting material generally yields well above 70&#8201;% are achieved, both, with stiff aromatic as well as flexible aliphatic substrates, as long as the ester groups involved are remote enough from each other. Otherwise competing reactions are becoming determinative, anhydride formation in the case of phthalates and decarbonylative fragmentation in the case of malonates. The new method was also successfully tested on a multigram scale with a minimalistic apparatus setup.

         <title>The First Total Synthesis of Racemic Chebulic Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first total synthesis of racemic chebulic acid is reported, which is the aglycon of several antioxidant ingredients of the fruit of the  Terminalia chebula  tree. The route started with the straightforward preparation of an indanone&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;oxoester from a benzaldehyde derivative (84% over the first five steps). The side chain of the target compound was then introduced by conjugated addition of a cuprate reagent derived from dimethyl succinate, which was followed by the first key step of the synthesis: a cerium&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of an &#946;&#8208;oxoester. The second key step was the cyanide&#8208;catalyzed ring transformation of the cyclic &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoester to a &#948;&#8208;lactone. This is a new reaction which has been recently developed in our laboratories. Finally, chebulic acid was obtained after six&#8208;fold demethylation of three methyl ester moieties and three phenolic ether functions. The overall synthetic route consists of nine consecutive steps and was accomplished in 15% overall yield. Both, the synthetic, racemic product as well the natural, optically active material consist of the same two diastereoisomers (2:1  dr  ).</dc:description>

The Front Cover illustrates the reaction conditions of &#946;&#8208;propiolactone in the superacidic system HF/SbF5 at low temperatures. The reflection on the water surface is representative for the equal conditions with exception of the reaction temperature. Here, the water surface represents the temperature limit of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. Below this temperature, the formation of monoprotonated 3&#8208;hydroxypropanoyl fluoride occurs exclusively, while above this temperature, exclusively triprotonated species of 1,5,9&#8208;trioxacyclododecane&#8208;2,6,10&#8208;trione is formed.

         <title>Asymmetric Povarov reactions: An update of a powerful catalytic synthetic methodology</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enantioselective Povarov reaction is&#160;one of the most powerful synthetic strategy to synthesize chiral, highly functionalized 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines. The present review aims to collect the most significant successful examples of highly efficient enantioselective catalytic protocols for this reaction, since 2014 to the present day.

         <title>A mechanistic study on the non&#8208;enzymatic hydrolysis of Kdn glycosides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sialic acids are biologically important carbohydrates that are prevalent throughout nature. We are interested in their intrinsic reactivity in aqueous solution and how such reactivity affects the design of substrates for investigation of enzymes that process these sugars. To probe the reactivity differences between two sialic acid family members  N  &#8208;acetylneuraminic acid and Kdn we measured the rate constants for hydrolysis of 4&#8208;nitrophenyl 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;  glycero  &#8208;&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;  galacto  &#8208;non&#8208;2&#8208;ulosonide in aqueous solution. The kinetic data is consistent with glycosidic C&#8211;O bond cleavage occurring via four mechanistic pathways, and these are: (i) hydronium ion&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of the neutral sugar; (ii) hydronium ion&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of the glycosidic carboxylate; (iii) water&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of the anionic glycoside; and (iv) base&#8208;promoted reaction of the anionic glycoside. All hydrolytic rate constants for PNP&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Kdn were larger than those reported for the parent sialoside 4&#8208;nitrophenyl  N  &#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;neuraminide (  2  ). To study the effects of C&#8208;5 substitution on the Kdn glycoside we made g 4&#8208;nitrophenyl 5&#8208;  O  &#8208;methyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Kdn glycoside (  4  ) and determined its rate constants for hydrolysis. To probe the transition state for the water&#8208;catalyzed reaction (pathway iii) we measured hydrolysis for three aryl &#945;&#8208;Kdn glycosides; the resulting Br&#248;nsted plot exhibited a &#946;  lg  value of &#8211;1.27 &#177; 0.09.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of conjugated  syn,syn  &#8208;dithienothiazine donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor dumbbells is readily synthesized by Suzuki coupling or a one&#8208;pot &#945;&#8208;lithiation&#8208;zincation&#8208;Negishi coupling sequence in moderate to good yield. The title compounds are all electron&#8208;rich reversible oxidizable redox systems with a relatively narrow range of oxidation potentials according to cyclic voltammetry. UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy however show a significant effect of the electronic nature of the conjugated bridging system on absorption and emission characteristics. Furthermore, a highly polar excited state can be corroborated by Lippert&#8208;Mataga analysis of the emission solvatochromicity as well as by TD&#8208;DFT calculation of absorption and emission maxima, which classify these dumbbell systems as redox active, luminescent low band gap chromophores with experimentally determined optical band gaps between 2.20 and 2.50 eV.</dc:description>

         <title>PAHs Containing both Heptagon and Pentagon: Corannulene Extension by [5+2] Annulation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general synthetic method based on hydroboration, electrophilic borylation, dehydrogenation and [5+2] annulation affords molecules with both bowl&#8208; and saddle&#8208;shape and the inclusion of a formal azulene unit. Their optical and electronic properties were studied to elucidate the ramifications of different substituents. Furthermore, their aromaticity was assessed through theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Utilizing Pd&#8208;catalyzed [5+2] annulation a series of heptagon&#8208;extended corannulenes could be synthesized from a borinic acid precursor furnished by C&#8722;H borylation strategy. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed the presence of two conformational enantiomers crystallizing in a racemic mixture. Through their embedded five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered rings these polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) exhibit both negative and positive curvature and UV/Vis/NIR absorption spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry experiments provided insights into the influence of larger flanking aromatic systems and electron&#8208;donating substituents encompassing the heptagonal ring. Through [5+2] annulation of acenaphthylene an azulene&#8208;containing PAH with intriguing optoelectronical properties including a very small bandgap and absorption over the whole visible spectrum could be obtained. Theoretical calculations were employed to elucidate the long&#8208;wavelength absorption and aromaticity.

         <title>Tuning material properties of porous organic cage CC3 with post&#8208;synthetic dynamic covalent chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous organic cages (POCs) represent a new class of microporous materials with an impressive breadth of potential applications. One of their many advantages is the degree of tunability of cage properties, similar to that seen in more established microporous materials like metal&#8208;organic frameworks. Here, we use a prototypical POC, CC3, to explore the potential to tune cage properties via post&#8208;synthetic dynamic covalent chemistry. Ethylenediamine, the linker used in another POC CC1, was partially substituted into the CC3 cage structure to varying degrees based on the starting relative molar ratios. The resulting products were investigated for the relative distribution of the two linkers, crystallinity, and surface area. We found that even when small amounts of other compatible diamine linkers are introduced, they substitute into the existing cages, although some structural products are apparently favored over others within the reactant ratios investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Aryl Sulfides by Metal&#8208;Free Arylation of Thiols with Diaryliodonium Salts under Basic Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free arylation of thiols with diaryliodonium salts has been developed. The application of a strong organic base enables the C&#8211;S bond formation under mild and experimentally simple conditions. The method allows for the synthesis of aryl sulfides containing a broad range of aryl groups from an array of thiols, including aryl, heteroaryl, and alkyl ones. The mechanism of the reaction was studied by DFT calculations, demonstrating that it proceeds via the inner sphere pathway involving formation of an Ar  2  I(SR) intermediate, followed by the reductive elimination.</dc:description>

The method allows for the synthesis of aryl sulfides containing a broad range of aryl groups from an array of thiols, including aryl, heteroaryl, and alkyl ones. The mechanism of the reaction was studied by DFT calculations, demonstrating that it proceeds via the inner sphere pathway involving formation of an Ar  2  I(SR) intermediate, followed by the reductive elimination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Glycosylation reaction involving the coupling of a glycosyl donor with a glycosyl acceptor is one of the cornerstones of chemical preparation of pure glycans and glycoconjugates of biological relevance. Catalytic glycosylation of glycosyl ester donors and thioglycosides is an attractive but underexplored topic in carbohydrate chemistry. Herein, Triflic imide (Tf 2 NH)&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation of various O &#8208;, S &#8208;, and C &#8208;nucleophiles has been achieved using disarmed glycosyl ortho &#8208;isopropenylphenylacetates (GIPPAs) and ortho &#8208;isopropenylbenzyl thioglycosides &#160;as glycosylating agents. The reactions proceed under mild conditions to give the desired glycosides in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. Of particular note, the comparable reactivity for the a&#8208;isomers and the &#946;&#8208;ones of GIPPAs is observed. The mechanistic investigation demostrates that the isopropenyl group is essential for the reaction and its preferential protonation triggers the reaction. This work provides another member to the arsenals of glycosyl ester and thioglyoside donors suitable for acid&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation to create various glycosidic bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Fidelity Dimerization of Xanthenyl Radicals and Dynamic Qualities of a Congested Ethane: Diethyl Dixanthenyl&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;Dicarboxylate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermolysis of the central weak C&#8722;C bond in a symmetrical xanthenyl dimer produces two carbon&#8208;centered xanthenyl radicals. Dissociation is highly reversible &#8211; the radicals couple exclusively in a head&#8208;to&#8208;head fashion that reforms the original sterically congested ethane, which itself exhibits restricted rotation about the central ethane C&#8722;C bond.







Abstract
Exploration of the sterically&#8208;congested ethane diethyl dixanthenyl&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate has revealed the dynamic behavior arising from its congested C&#8722;C bond. Interlocking &#8216;geared&#8217; substituents and favorable dispersion interactions around this bond result in a conformational preference for partially cofacial xanthene moieties both in solid state and as dilute solutions. The weak, centrally located C&#8722;C bond is 1.628&#8197;&#197; long and permits selective thermolysis to yield two carbon&#8208;centered ethyl xanthenyl&#8208;9&#8208;carboxylate radicals, which dimerize with high fidelity into the original sterically&#8208;congested ethane. Recombination of the radicals into this symmetrical head&#8208;to&#8208;head dimer is highly reproducible &#8211; by observing the equilibrium, the bond dissociation enthalpy was calculated to be 20.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The substituents around the central carbon provide insufficient stabilization against oxygen, which consumes the radicals and unbalances the dimer&#8208;radical equilibrium.

         <title>From Simple Alkenes and CO2 to Fluorinated Carboxylic Acids: Computational Studies and Predictions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated carboxylic acids can be envisaged as future synthetic targets because of their potential applications in materials science and medicinal chemistry. Computational studies suggest that these interesting compounds may be easily accessed from simple alkenes containing &#8722;CF3 or &#8722;SCF3 groups and carbon dioxide by means of a hydroboration/copper&#8208;catalyzed carboxylation sequence.







Abstract
Fluorinated carboxylic acids may soon become a relevant class of compounds for new materials development and as synthons in medicinal chemistry. In this report, a potential method based on a hydroboration/copper&#8208;catalyzed carboxylation reaction sequence has been computationally explored to check whether these moieties could be synthetically accessible. DFT calculations fully support the possibility of obtaining fluorinated carboxylic acids from simple fluorinated alkenes and gaseous carbon dioxide, paving the way to future preparation of this class of chemicals.

         <title>Photocatalytic Radical Addition to Levoglucosenone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) transfer is applied to the stereoselective addition of alkanes, acetales, ethers, formamide and aldehydes to levoglucosenone. Bond dissociation energies and partial charges have been calculated in order to discuss the highly selective HAT at cyreneTM.







Abstract
Using photocatalysis with tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium decatungstate (TBADT), alkanes, cyclic acetals, cyclic ethers, formamide and aldehydes were added in a stereoselective way to levoglucosenone (LGO). A hydrogen atom is transferred from the donor compound to the photochemically excited TBADT, and the resulting radicals add onto LGO in a stereoselective way. In the case of the addition of adamantane, two regio&#8208;isomers were obtained which form a crystalline solid solution. Cyrene&#8482;, obtained by hydrogenation of LGO, was added under the same conditions. In this case, only two of 32 possible isomers of the resulting Cyrene&#8482; dimer were formed. The regio&#8208;selectivity of the HAT step is discussed in detail. For this purpose, bond dissociation energies and partial charges have been calculated. Transition state calculations of the radical addition to LGO explain the stereospecificity of this reaction step.

         <dc:description>An efficient catalytic preparation of synthetically useful new &#946;&#8208;borylated enamides was achieved under relatively mild conditions  via  a regioselective iridium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp  2  )&#8210;H borylation.

         <title>Synthesis of a Substituted [10]Cycloparaphenylene via [2+2+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis and investigation of a substituted [10]Cycloparaphenylene (CPP) incorporating a diethylphthalane unit. An efficient strategy relying on a symmetric built&#8208;up starting with propargyl ether as [2+2+2] cycloaddition precursor was developed. The straightforward synthesis required overcoming unexpected obstacles within the [2+2+2] cycloaddition, protection and aromatization. These results give valuable insights for accessing CPPs with highly substituted subunits. Finally, a seven&#8208;step synthesis with an overall yield of 14% provided the target nanoring, including good to excellent yields for the critical macrocyclization and aromatization. The synthesized nanohoop exhibits a hypsochromic shift in fluorescence and absorption, compared to the unsubstituted [10]CPP. This observation is proposedly caused by an increased torsion angle between the bivalent substituted phenyl moieties and the adjacent units.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistically Guided One Pot Synthesis of Phosphine&#8208;phosphite and Its Implication in Asymmetric Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although hybrid bidentate ligands are known to yield highly enantioselective products in asymmetric hydrogenation (AH), synthesis of these ligands is an arduous process. Herein, one pot, atom economic synthesis of a hybrid phosphine&#8208;phosphite (L1) is reported. After understanding the reactivity difference between an O&#8208;nucleophile versus C&#8208;nucleophile, one pot synthesis of Senphos (L1) was achieved (72%). When L1 was treated with [Rh], 31P NMR revealed bidentate coordination to Rh. Senphos, in the presence of rhodium catalyses the AH of Methyl&#8208;2&#8208;acetamido&#8208;3&#8208;phenylacrylate and discloses an unprecedented turn over frequency of 2289, along with excellent enantio&#8208;selectivity (92%). The generality is demonstrated by hydrogenating an array of alkenes. The AH operates under mild conditions of 1&#8208;2 bar H2 pressure, at room temperature. The practical relevance of L1 is demonstrated by scaling&#8208;up the reaction to 1 g and by synthesizing DOPA, a drug widely employed for the treatment of Parkinson&#8217;s disease. Computational insights indicate that the R isomer is preferred by 3.8 kcal/mol over the S isomer.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated amides synthesis starting from carbohydrates based on the Claisen rearrangement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The search for new methods for installation of fluorine atoms into organic molecules is still a widely studied issue. In this paper an efficient synthetic protocol towards the synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing amides derived from sugar has been presented. This approach involved the Claisen rearrangement of previously obtained fluorinated vinyl ethers. The three fluorinated olefins: 1,1,3,3,3&#8208;pentafluoroprop&#8208;1&#8208;ene (2H&#8208;PFP), 1,2,3,3,3&#8208;pentafluoroprop&#8208;1&#8208;ene (1H&#8208;PFP) and hexafluoroprop&#8208;1&#8208;ene (HFP) were used as a source of fluorine. New compounds were characterized by  1  H,  19  F and  13  C NMR spectroscopy and high resolution mass spectrometry. The X&#8208;Ray crystal structures of some fluorinated derivatives were obtained confirming the structure, geometry and the absolute configuration. The resulting molecules, due to possibility of further transformation of their functional groups, can be valuable fluorinated scaffolds for the synthesis of subsequent chemical compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Convergent and practical synthesis of fluorescent triphenylamine derivatives and their localization in living cells</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the search for new fluorescent triphenylamine (TP) derivatives, we studied the influence of the position and substitution of diverse heterocyclic substituents. A library of 10 fluorescent triphenylamines bearing either oxazoles or thiazoles and pyridiniums, substituted at different positions has been developed. The approach is based on a convergent C&#8208;H activation reaction between pyridine&#8208;oxazoles or pyridine&#8208;thiazoles and di&#8208;iodo triphenylamine. We showed that the nature and substitution pattern of the 5&#8208;membered&#8208; (oxazole, thiazole) or 6&#8208;membered heterocycle (pyridine) has a strong influence on their fluorescence properties and on their localization in living cells as they stain either the nucleus or mitochondria.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
New polycyclic conjugated scaffolds combining pyrene and cyclobutadienoid were synthesized and characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The compounds show different aromaticity and photophysical properties as a result of the fusion patterns of pyrene and cyclobutadienoid.

Abstract
This study explored new polycyclic conjugated scaffolds combining pyrene and cyclobutadienoid rings. Regioisomeric bis(naphthocyclobuta)pyrenes were synthesized and characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. It was found that the regioisomeric polycyclic conjugated scaffolds exhibit different local aromaticity and photophysical properties as a result of the different fusion patterns of pyrene and cyclobutadienoid. Tuning the &#960;&#8208;stacking of bisnaphtho[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:3,4]cyclobuta[1,2&#8208;e:1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;l]pyrene by changing the length of the alkyl substituents led to a p&#8208;type organic semiconductor for solution&#8208;processed thin film transistors.

&lt;p&gt;This study explored new polycyclic conjugated scaffolds combining pyrene and cyclobutadienoid rings. Regioisomeric bis(naphthocyclobuta)pyrenes were synthesized and characterized by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. It was found that the regioisomeric polycyclic conjugated scaffolds exhibit different local aromaticity and photophysical properties as a result of the different fusion patterns of pyrene and cyclobutadienoid. Tuning the &#960;-stacking of bisnaphtho[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:3,4]cyclobuta[1,2-&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;:1&#8242;,2&#8242;-&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;]pyrene by changing the length of the alkyl substituents led to a p-type organic semiconductor for solution-processed thin film transistors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Transformation of Lignin and Lignin Model Compounds into Benzimidazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is a challenging task to simultaneously achieve selective depolymerization and valorization of lignin due to their complex structure and relatively stable bonds. We herein report an efficient depolymerization strategy that employs 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) as oxidant/catalyst to selectively convert different oxidized lignin models to a wide variety of 2&#8208;phenylbenzimidazole&#8208;based compounds in up to 94% yields, by reacting with o&#8208;phenylenediamines with varied substituents. This method could take full advantage of both C  &#946;  and/or C  &#947;  atom in lignin structure to furnish the desirable products instead of forming byproducts, thus exhibiting high atom economy. Furthermore, this strategy can effectively transform both the oxidized hardwood (birch) and softwood (pine) lignin into the corresponding degradation products in up to 45 wt% and 30 wt%, respectively. Through a &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; process, we have successfully realized the oxidation/depolymerization/valorization of natural birch lignin at the same time and produced the benzimidazole derivatives in up to 67 wt% total yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Studies of Potential Inhibitors of CD73 Based on a Triazole Scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several series of substituted 1,4,5&#8208;triazole derivatives bearing various aryls, alkyls and indoles groups were synthetized, as inhibitors of 5&#8242;&#8208;ectonucleotidase CD73, and evaluated for their potential inhibitory effect on purified recombinant hCD73 enzyme and in cell&#8208;based assays. Among them, some compounds were found to be potent enzymatic inhibitors at 10&#8197;&#956;M.







Abstract
The ecto&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;nucleotidase CD73 is involved in the production of immunosuppressive adenosine in the tumoral microenvironment and recently became a validated target in immuno&#8208;oncology. To avoid formation of CD73&#8208;produced adenosine, several series of potential inhibitors of the target enzyme based on a triazole scaffold were synthetized and evaluated on recombinant purified hCD73 and in cell&#8208;based assays.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dyn[n]arenes are the strict polydisulfide&#8208;based analogues of pillar[n]arenes. Although less famous than their static homologues, these dynamic cavitand possess unique (stereo)chemical features. The disulfide bridge between monomeric units not only provides these architectures with constitutional lability but also an additional stereogenic element. As a result, the covalent assembling process can be guided by supramolecular interactions with or without a targeted partner, enabling to decipher supramolecular at work from the synthetic stage. Not only can the size and functions can be chosen on demand, but the stereochemical features can be precisely controlled by careful choice on the assembling conditions. Eventually, deciphering the interactions at work during self&#8208;assembly opens the way toward innovative applications such as biomolecules sensing. The account describes the synergistic interplay between covalent and non&#8208;covalent bonds found in dyn[n]arenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemistry at Scale: Wireless Light Emitters Drive Sustainability in Process Research &amp; Development</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our study demonstrates a seamless scale&#8208;up of photochemical C&#8722;C&#8208;cross&#8208;couplings of aryls and alkyls via dual Ir/Ni photoredox catalysis. The herein described novel type of internal illumination using wirelessly powered LEDs inside the reaction media allows for efficient scaling and intensification of those reactions, maintaining virtually identical reaction profiles over all scales. The system is readily applicable to other light&#8208;driven reactions as well.







Abstract
Carbon&#8722;carbon bond formation by dual Iridium&#8208;Nickel photoredox catalysis has gained a lot of attention for late&#8208;stage cross&#8208;couplings of alkyls with aryls. However, the scalability of such reactions is greatly impeded by the poor light penetration depth into the strongly absorbing reaction media. Wireless internal illumination is a novel technique which circumvents the light penetration issue efficiently and therefore allows to scale photon&#8208;driven reactions by conventional methods. Here we demonstrate that industrially relevant photoredox C&#8722;C couplings can be scaled seamlessly to different volumes, achieving qualitatively and quantitatively the same results at all scales. The use of conventional reactor types allows stirred, bubble column or fixed&#8208;bed operation mode and is fully compatible with heterogeneous reaction mixtures. By minimizing reflection losses, we could also show a significant advantage in the reaction rate over an externally illuminated setup at the same light intensity.

         <title>Direct Difluoromethylation of Heterocycles through Photosensitized Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient, transition metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free, direct C(sp2)&#8208;H difluoromethylation of heterocycles through visible light&#8208;induced electron transfer was developed. The reaction afforded difluoromethyl heterocycles by only using photoexcited diacetyl. The reaction showed a broad substrate tolerance and gave the products in good yields. Moreover, the representative products exhibited potential drug activity and showed good antifungal activities.







Abstract
Difluoromethylation is of prime importance for its applicability in functionalizing diverse fluorine&#8208;containing heterocycles, which are core groups in diverse biologically and pharmacologically active ingredients. Herein, we report a novel transition metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free visible light&#8208;photoinduced protocol for direct C(sp2)&#8208;H difluoromethylation of heterocycles. The reaction afforded difluoromethyl heterocycles without using colored organic dyes and metal catalysts in good yields and showed a broad substrate tolerance. Moreover, the representative products exhibited potential drug activity, and one product showed good antifungal activities against Rhizoctorzia solani (62.7&#8201;%).

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Dicarbofunctionalization of Unactivated Alkenes: Synthesis of Fluoroalkylated Heterocycles with All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Centers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The redox&#8208;neutral Pd&#8208;catalyzed dicarbofunctionalization of unactivated alkenes with a variety of functionalized perfluoroalkyl halide is presented. This transformation enables the assembly of diversified fluoroalkylated pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoles with one all&#8208;carbon quaternary center in high regioselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggest the generation of perfluoroalkyl radicals from the single electron reduction of palladium(0) to perfluoroalkyl halides.







Abstract
The redox&#8208;neutral palladium&#8208;catalyzed dicarbofunctionalization of unactivated alkenes with a variety of functionalized difluoromethyl and perfluoroalkyl halide is presented here. This transformation proceeds smoothly at low temperatures and enables the assembly of diversified fluoroalkylated pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indole derivatives with one all&#8208;carbon quaternary center in high regioselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggested an operative radical mechanism and the initiation of the inner&#8208;sphere single electron transfer between a dual phosphine ligand&#8208;coordinated palladium(0) species and perfluoroalkyl halides.

         <title>Trapping Experiments during Reductive Debrominations of Aminotribromosilanes with Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive debrominations of the tribromosilanes {N(SiMe3)2}SiBr3 (3) and {N(SiMe3)Dipp}SiBr3 (4) with Mg* in the presence of ethylene revealed the occurrence of transient amido&#8208;substituted disilynes (1) and (2) via the corresponding cycloaddition products. This was confirmed by using 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene in the reductive debromination of (4) that yields the disilabicyclo[2.2.0]hexane (7). Using 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene as trapping agent in the reaction of (4) with Mg* showed that a cyclotrisilene was generated during the reduction.







Abstract
In&#8208;situ generated amido&#8208;substituted disilynes (SiMe3)2N&#8722;Si&#8801;Si&#8722;N(SiMe3)2 1 and (SiMe3)DippN&#8722;Si&#8801;Si&#8722;N(SiMe3)Dipp 2 were observed examined upon the reductive dehalogenation of the tribromosilanes {N(SiMe3)2}SiBr3 3 and {N(SiMe3)Dipp}SiBr3 4 with Rieke magnesium (Mg*). Both disilynes were trapped with ethylene to yield the double [2+1] and [2+2] cycloaddition products 5 and 6, respectively. The transient disilynes 1 and 2 were investigated with DFT calculations that revealed 1 to feature more triple bond character than 2. The in&#8208;situ generated disilyne 2 was further quenched with 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene to yield the double [2+2] cycloaddition product 7. In the presence of cyclooctatetraene, the reductive debromination of 4 with Mg* generates the bromo&#8208;substituted silacyclopentene 8. This species was also isolated with 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene used as trapping reagent as the major product 9, besides the side product 10, that comprises two cyclotrisilene rings linked via a butene unit. The formation of 10 shows that a cyclotrisilene can occur as a side product during the reductive debromination of 4 in the presence of the alkene.

         <title>Template Synthesis of Novel Norcorrole Complexes with a Phenyl&#8208;substituted Phosphorus Center</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel norcorroles complexes with a phenyl&#8208;substituted phosphorus center were synthesized&#160;by a&#160;template method and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray single crystal&#160;diffraction. It was&#160;proved&#160;that these new norcorrole phosphorus complexes have aromaticity similar to the very recently reported norcorrole complex with a methoxy&#8208;substituted&#160;phosphorus center. This aromaticity results from the peripheral 18&#960;&#8208;system consisting of two methine carbons and four amine&#8208;type pyrrole units with formally pentavalent phosphorus center. On the other hand, these phenyl&#8208;substituted phosphorus complexes showed quite characteristic and strong Q&#8208;band derived from less symmetricity of the molecules than other porphyrinoids.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed N1 Coupling of 3&#8208;Aminoindazoles and Related Aminoazoles with Aryl Bromides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coupling between 3&#8208;aminoindazoles and aryl bromides, selectively occurring at the N1 position, was developed using copper catalysis. The transformation allows the use of a variety of heterocycles for both coupling partners and provides rapid access to arylated aminoazoles of high interest in drug discovery.







Abstract
The N1&#8208;selective arylation of 3&#8208;aminoindazoles using copper catalysis is herein reported. The reaction uses readily accessible aryl bromides as coupling partners, including those from heterocycles, and allows easy access to a broad variety of substituted 3&#8208;aminoindazoles. The methodology was also examined on other aminoazoles of interest for the pharmaceutical industry.

         <title>SnAr Isocyanide Diversification</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isocyanides are important building blocks in organic synthesis; however, their synthesis is time and resource consuming and often unpleasant due to their smelly nature. Diversification of isocyanides can be accomplished by  de novo  synthesis or from already existing isocyanides. Here we report for the first&#8208;time isocyanide diversification based on nucleophilic aromatic substitution of suitable precursor isocyanides. The mild conditions allow easy access to multiple novel isocyanides useful in organic synthesis. The resulting isocyanides are solid and non&#8208;noxious, yet react nicely in multicomponent reactions.</dc:description>

A practical approach for preparing 2&#8208;arylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones by an I2/DMSO&#8208;mediated intramolecular oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;(benzylamino)benzamides to form C=N bonds has been developed.







Abstract
A novel approach for the synthesis of 2&#8208;arylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones was developed. A series of title compounds were obtained with good functional group tolerance and good yields by I2/DMSO&#8208;mediated intramolecular oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;(benzylamino)benzamides to form C=N double bonds. This method was applicable for gram&#8208;scale synthesis. A proposed reaction pathway based on some control experiments was also provided.

         <title>Organocalcium Complex&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrogenative Coupling of Hydrosilanes with Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With a calcium alkyl complex [LCaCH2SiMe3] (L=[MeC(NDipp)CHC(tBu)NCH2CH2N(Me)CH2CH2NMe2]&#8722;, Dipp=2,6&#8208;(iPr)2C6H3) as the catalyst, the reactions of n&#8208;HexSiH3 with terminal alkynes are able to provide trialkynylsilanes. On the other hand, the reactions of Et2SiH2 with terminal alkynes give monoalkynylsilanes efficiently.







Abstract
Alkynylsilanes are an important class of organic compounds and dehydrogenative coupling of hydrosilanes with terminal alkynes provides a convenient and simple route to alkynylsilanes. On the other hand, calcium is an abundant, biocompatible, and environmentally friendly element and using organocalcium complexes as catalytic reagents in organic synthesis recently attracted increasing attentions. Here we report an organocalcium complex&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling of hydrosilanes with terminal alkynes. With a calcium alkyl complex [LCaCH2SiMe3] (L=[MeC(NDipp)CHC(tBu)NCH2CH2N(Me)CH2CH2NMe2]&#8722;, Dipp=2,6&#8208;(iPr)2C6H3) as the catalyst, the reactions of n&#8208;HexSiH3 with terminal alkynes provide trialkynylsilanes and those of Et2SiH2 with terminal alkynes give monoalkynylsilanes efficiently.

         <title>Primary Amine Catalyzed Activation of Carbonyl Compounds: A Study on Reaction Pathways and Reactive Intermediates by Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Offline ESI&#8208;MS experiments can be easily pursuit to select optimal (catalyst, cocatalyst, reaction time, reagent amounts) working conditions for the primary amines catalyzed activation of carbonyl compounds. Combining MS and MSn experiments with enantioselective HPLC analysis, the catalytic cycle together with its active (typically enamine or iminium ions) intermediates and the stereochemical induction processes were elucidated.







Abstract
The field of organocatalysis is expanding at a fast pace. Its growth is sustained by major stimuli, such as the effort toward an understanding of the mechanisms of reaction and catalytic processes in general, the elucidation of basic properties leading to stereocontrol and the search for broad applicability and scalability of the synthetic methodology. This paper reports a thorough study based on ESI&#8208;MS spectrometry of amino&#8208;organocatalyzed model reactions under different experimental conditions. Off&#8208;line reaction monitoring of mixtures containing different catalytic systems, by ESI&#8208;MSn showed the presence of several putative intermediate species, either in their protonated or sodiated forms. In addition, enantioselective chromatography of crude reactions provides the stereochemical outcome of asymmetric reactions. The bulk of the data collected offers a clue of the intricate pathways occurring in solution for the studied reactions.

         <title>Application of Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Decarbonylation of Aldehydes in the Total Synthesis of Natural Products</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decarbonylation of aldehydes is an important reaction used for defunctionalization of molecules. The aldehyde functional group can act as a traceless and transient directing group and its removal can be accomplished with different transition metal catalysts. This Review focuses on the application of the decarbonylation of aldehydes in the total synthesis of natural products with metal&#8208;based catalysts.







Abstract
Decarbonylation is an invaluable reaction, utilized by nature and chemists alike. In different life forms, such as prokaryotes, plants and animals, this transformation is catalyzed by aldehyde decarbonylases. In the laboratory, the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed (TMC) decarbonylation, which was first achieved in 1959, is by and large the dominant way for conducting this reaction. The carbon&#8208;carbon bond cleavage is most often made possible by RhCl(PPh3)3 i.&#8201;e. Wilkinson's catalyst, but other metals are also used, both in academia and in industry. In this review, we chose to present the applications of TMC decarbonylation in the synthesis of natural products and their derivatives. More than 30 examples are showcased and categorized into three categories based on the essence of the role of the aldehyde group in the synthesis. A short outlook is given in the end, listing the different advantages and disadvantages of Wilkinson's catalyst, as well as offering a brief prospect for the future.

         <title>On the Shape and Synthesis of Extended Fluorenones: Recent Advances and Upcoming Challenges</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective synthesis of tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208; and octa&#8208;cyclic extended fluorenones and their topological diversity. This Review provides an overview of the literature up to March 2021.







Abstract
Extended fluorenones represent a particular class of polycyclic compounds. The extension of the aromatic system through the fusion of additional benzene rings onto the central tricyclic fluorenone gives rise to an impressive topological diversity and allows to modulate the properties of the original molecule. The multiple ways this aromatic extension can be joined onto the tricyclic core generates multiple spatial arrangements from linear, angular, mixed linear&#8208;angular, to helical. This extensive range of shapes and their subsequent applications has piqued the curiosity of the scientific community, who now creatively compete to develop selective and direct routes to these valuable molecular architectures. Potential applications of these diverse domains have also driven the development of strategies for the installation of various substituents at selected sites of the carbon backbone. This Review intends to provide the reader with an up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of the methods for constructing extended fluorenones and their properties.

         <title>From Enantioenriched Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropylcarbinols to Axially Chiral Arylnaphthalenes through Aryldihydronaphthalenes: Central&#8208;to&#8208;Axial Chirality Exchange</title>

         <dc:description>
Transformation of cyclopropylcarbinols 7 to 1&#8208;arylnaphthalenes 9 established a central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality&#8208;exchange method in two steps: i) BF3&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening cyclization of D&#8208;A cyclopropylcarbinols 7 (97 to &gt;99&#8201;% ee) to afford aryldihydronaphthalenes 8, which bear ortho&#8208;R substituents on the benzene ring; ii) dehydrogenation of the obtained aryldihydronaphthalenes 8 by using DDQ furnished the axially chiral arylnaphthalenes 9 with 90 to &gt;99&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
Transformations of enantioenriched donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) cyclopropylcarbinols to enantioenriched 1&#8208;arylnaphthalenes that bear an ortho&#8208;substituent on a benzene ring provided a successful chirality&#8208;exchange method with a high level of stereoinduction. A central chirality&#8208;transfer step, i.&#8201;e., a Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening cyclization of enantioenriched D&#8208;A cyclopropylcarbinols (97 to &gt;99&#8201;% ee), afforded 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes with an ortho&#8208;substituent (Me, Br, OMe, OBn, or OiPr) on the benzene ring with high enantioselectivity (97 to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). The central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality&#8208;exchange step, i.&#8201;e., the dehydrogenation of the obtained enantioenriched 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes using DDQ, furnished the axially chiral 1&#8208;arylnaphthalenes with high enantioselectivity (90 to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). Importantly, we developed a highly enantioselective synthesis of a 1&#8208;arylnaphthalene with an ortho&#8208;alkoxy group on the benzene ring. Moreover, we improved the chirality exchange to furnish a 1&#8208;arylnaphthalene with an ortho&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;substituted benzene ring in high yield with high ee.

         <title>N&#8208;Thiocyanato&#8208;2,10&#8208;camphorsultam Derivatives: Design and Applications of Original Electrophilic Thiocyanating Reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of chiral electrophilic thiocyanating reagents was designed and synthesized through an efficient protocol. These bench&#8208;stable and robust reagents were applied for the functionalization of electron&#8208;rich (hetero)arenes and the difunctionalization of alkenes.







Abstract
The synthesis of bench&#8208;stable electrophilic thiocyanating reagents was depicted in two steps from readily available starting materials in good yields. These newly designed electrophilic reagents were successfully applied for the thiocyanation of different nucleophiles under mild and transition metal&#8208;free conditions. Preliminary experiments for the asymmetric C3&#8208;thiocyanation of an oxindole derivative were also conducted leading to the expected product with no induction of chirality, although opening possibilities for accessing chiral compounds.

         <title>Total synthesis of entrectinib with key photo&#8208;redox mediated cross&#8208;coupling in flow</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Through the use of photo&#8208;redox catalysis in flow the newly marketed drug Rozlytrek was synthesized in 6 linear steps from readily available building blocks under mild conditions. Evaluation of multiple intermediates for their use in the critical C&#8208;N amination step in flow led to the finding that more electron deficient aryl&#8208;halides achieve higher conversion to the desired product. Data supports that more electron rich aryl&#8208;halides undergo a significant amount of hydrodehalogenation compared to the productive C&#8208;N bond formation. Through evaluating various entry points into the synthesis of Rozlytrek shorter routes were identified albeit in low yields. The modularity of this route will allow chemists to rapidly synthesize a diverse library of compounds via this route. Through different synthetic intermediates, a scale&#8208;up route was discovered for the synthesis of Rozlytrek using photo&#8208;redox in flow in less steps than previously reported, highlighting the utility of flow chemistry in the pharmaceutical industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted 1,3&#8208;Dioxa&#8208;[3,3]&#8208;Sigmatropic Rearrangement of Substituted Allylic Carbamates: Application to the Synthesis of Novel 1,3&#8208;Oxazine&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione Derivatives</title>

         <dc:description>
The acceleration of 1,3&#8208;dioxa&#8208;[3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of aryl allylic carbamates under microwave irradiation was described. The implementation of these unconventional thermal conditions allowed the development of an original synthetic route to new heterocycle products such as (E)&#8208;5&#8208;arylidene&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxaninane&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones.







Abstract
In a first instance, the effect of the microwave irradiation on the 1,3&#8208;Dioxa&#8208;[3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of aryl allylic carbamates was investigated. Under these new conditions, the reaction acceleration was clearly highlighted compared to conventional heating conditions. Depending on the electronic nature of substituents on the aromatic group, this type of rearrangement can be faster with similar or improved yields. Due to this experimental improvement, the diversity of aryl allylic carbamates able to undergo this rearrangement in a reasonable reaction time (30&#8197;min.) and with acceptable to high yields was greatly extended. Finally, an original synthetic way involving this microwave&#8208;assisted process to access new six&#8208;membered heterocyclic structures such as (E)&#8208;5&#8208;arylidene&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazinane&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones was developed from Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) adducts showing the interest of this molecular rearrangement approach. DFT and Fragment Distortion studies showed in general polar transition structures and connected high deformation and interaction energies with lower activation barriers.

         <title>Investigation of Squaramide Catalysts in the Aldol Reaction En Route to Funapide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric aldol reaction of an industrially viable synthesis of funapide, a promising analgesic agent, was studied with a range of squaramide catalysts. Compared to previously employed thiourea structures, these catalysts provided a non&#8208;negligible improvement in the enantioselectivity of the reaction, while keeping similar activity.







Abstract
Funapide is a 3,3&#8217;&#8208;spirocyclic oxindole with promising analgesic activity. A reported pilot&#8208;plant scale synthesis of this chiral compound involves an asymmetric aldol reaction, catalyzed by a common bifunctional thiourea structure. In this work, we show that the swapping of the thiourea unit of the catalyst for a tailored squaramide group provides an equally active, but rewardingly more selective, catalyst for this aldol reaction (from 70.5 to 85&#8201;% ee). The reaction was studied first on a model oxindole compound. Then, the set of optimal conditions was applied to the target funapide intermediate. The applicability of these conditions seems limited to oxindoles bearing the 3&#8208;substituent of funapide. Exemplifying the characteristics of target&#8208;focused methodological development, this study highlights how a wide&#8208;range screening of catalysts and reaction conditions can provide non&#8208;negligible improvements in an industrially viable asymmetric transformation.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Organocatalytic Kinetic Resolution of Oxazinones through Alcoholysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT study of a new effective approach to obtain orthogonally protected &#946;&#8208;amino acids via the kinetic resolution of oxazinones has been performed. From the computational study, the orientations of the reactants and the mechanism have been elucidated. Finally, the reaction involving a 7&#8208;memebered ring to access enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;amino acids was experimentally and computationally investigated.







Abstract
A complete computational study has been performed in order to rationalise the results of a new organocatalytic approach to the kinetic resolution of 4&#8208;substituted oxazinones which results in highly enantioenriched and orthogonally&#8208;protected &#946;&#8208;amino acids. DFT&#8208;analysis elucidated the preferable binding orientation of the 4&#8208;oxazinone under study, predicted the formation of the observed major R product with a calculated ee in good agreement with the experimental data and allowed a complete mechanistic and stereochemical understanding of the catalysis. The alcoholytic kinetic resolution of a 7&#8208;memebered ring analogue to generate enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;amino acids was experimentally and computationally investigated for the first time.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Doped PAH Electrochromes: Difurano, Dipyrano, and Furano&#8208;Pyrano Containing Naphthalene&#8208;Cored Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of naphthalenyl&#8208;cored O&#8208;doped small molecule electrochromes was achieved. In a single intramolecular Pummerer oxidative cycloetherification reaction, dipyrano, difurano, and furano&#8208;pyrano products could be obtained. All molecules showed p&#8208;type semiconducting and electrochromic properties, with the colour of the transition being dependent on the O&#8208;ring.







Abstract
In this work, we report the synthesis of O&#8208;doped naphthalene&#8208;based electrochromes. Exploiting the CuO&#8208;mediated Pummerer oxidative cycloetherification reaction, a series of 1,4&#8208; and 1,5&#8208;disubstituted naphthalene&#8208;cored dipyrano, difurano, and furano&#8208;pyrano polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been prepared. Steady&#8208;state UV&#8208;Vis absorption and emission investigations showed that the spectroscopic profile strongly depends on the O&#8208;doping topology, with the dipyrano and the difurano derivatives demonstrating the most red&#8208;shifted and blue&#8208;shifted electronic transition, respectively. Computational investigations revealed that the cycloetherification reaction raises the HOMO energy level (while the LUMO remains largely unaffected), with the dipyrano derivatives displaying the highest values. Spectroelectrochemical measurements showed that, depending on the O&#8208;topology and the type of O&#8208;ring, different electrochromic responses could be obtained with colour transitions featuring high contrasts involving yellow, pink, orange or blue colours.

         <title>Scope, Limitations and Mechanistic Analysis of the HyperBTM&#8208;Catalyzed Acylative Kinetic Resolution of Tertiary Heterocyclic Alcohols**
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isothiourea HyperBTM catalyzes the acylative kinetic resolution of a wide range of tertiary heterocyclic alcohols under mild conditions with high selectivity. The synthetic utility of the methodology has been demonstrated with the preparation of two bioactive targets. Kinetic analysis reveals a fractional reaction order with respect to the alcohol concentration.







Abstract
The full scope and limitations of the catalytic acylative kinetic resolution of a range of tertiary heterocyclic alcohols (78 examples, s up to &gt;200) is reported under operationally&#8208;simple conditions, using low loadings of a commercially available Lewis basic isothiourea catalyst, HyperBTM (generally 1&#8197;mol&#8201;%). The protocol is highly effective for the kinetic resolution of 3&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;hydroxyoxindole and &#945;&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;hydroxylactam derivatives bearing up to three potential recognition motifs at the stereogenic tertiary carbinol center. The full power of this methodology has been showcased through the synthesis of highly enantioenriched biologically&#8208;active target compounds in both enantiomeric forms. To provide further insight into the reaction mechanism, a detailed kinetic analysis of this Lewis base&#8208;catalyzed acylation of tertiary alcohols is reported using the variable time normalization analysis (VTNA) method.

         <title>A Hexagonal Shape&#8208;Persistent Nanobelt of Elongated Rhombic Symmetry with Orthogonal &#960;&#8208;Planes by a One&#8208;Pot Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>Triptycenes with their predefined D 3h &#8208;symmetry are excellent molecular building blocks to construct shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles having &#960;&#8208;orbitals orthogonal to the ring plane. However, up to now, there are only a very few examples of fused and rigid iptycene macrocycles synthesized in several consecutive steps in overall yields below 1%. Here we present the simple one&#8208;step one&#8208;pot approach to an iptycene nanobelt, which forms in &gt;2% and can readily isolated from the polymeric by&#8208;product by gel&#8208;permeation chromatography.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of azido&#8208;dienediols by enzymatic dioxygenation of benzylazides: an experimental and theoretical study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allylic azides are a versatile structural motif in organic synthesis because the proximal double bond enables a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement, named as the Winstein rearrangement. In this manuscript an experimental and theoretical study on the double Winstein rearrangement occurring in azidodienediols derived from the biocatalytic dihydroxylation of substituted benzylazides is presented. Substrates bearing a methyl group in  ortho  or  meta  position produced exclusively rearranged exo&#8208;diendiols with the azide group  anti  to the diol moiety as the major constituent. In the case of  para  methyl substrates, an equilibrium mixture of rearranged and non&#8208;rearranged products was observed, indicating that a full conversion to the exo&#8208;dienediols is not possible within this substitution pattern. On the other hand, the presence of a chloro substituent in the diene moiety completely precluded the Winstein rearrangement to take place, giving rise exclusively to the traditional  cis  &#8208;cyclohexadienediols. The observed results were analyzed to determine the mechanistic and kinetic aspects and scope limitations of the reaction as a synthetic tool.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Ring&#8208;Opening Reactions of Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the high reactivity of cyclopropanes, different methods have been developed for their stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;controlled ring&#8208;opening reactions to avail a variety of synthetically useful targets. The traditional methods for the ring&#8208;opening includes thermolysis, use of oxidants, transition metals or radical precursors in which many of them encounter various difficulties. In the past several years, visible light&#8208;mediated photoredox reactions received considerable attention for various organic transformations. Several methodologies are developed in recent times for the visible light&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening reactions of cyclopropanes.&#160;Considering the synthetic potential of these class of reactions, we provide a summary of various methodologies developed for the cyclopropane ring&#8208;opening reactions under visible light photoredox catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Proving Syntheses of the Polyenoyltetramic Acids Pyranonigrin J and I</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The polyenoyltetramic acids pyranonigrin J (3) and py&#173;ranonigrin I (4) had been isolated from Aspergillus niger. Their or&#173;igins from and roles in biosynthesis as well as the S&#8208;con&#173;figura&#173;tions of their stereocenter had been deduced from expres&#173;sion ex&#173;periments with modifications of the corresponding gene cluster. We corroborated this stereochemical assignment after ex&#173;ecuting the first total syntheses of both compounds because they had es&#173;sentially the same specific rotations as their natural coun&#173;ter&#173;parts. Our syntheses used the &#946;&#8208;ketothioester 18 as a con&#173;junctive re&#173;a&#173;gent. It was combined with the l&#8208;serine derivatives (S)&#8208;19 or (S)&#8208;21 (&#8220;Western building blocks&#8221;), respectively, through aminolyses.

         <title>Syntheses of 6,7&#8208;Benzotropolone Using Ring&#8208;Closing Metathesis Variants, Which Circumvent a Strongly Acidic Hydrolysis in the Sequel</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Wittig reaction of 3&#8208;hydroxyphtalide (11) gave ortho&#8208;sty&#173;rene&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid (12). Its Weinreb amide 13 acylated heterosub&#173;stituted methyllithiums. This led to aryl &#8220;methyl&#8221; ketones whose sp3&#8208;carbon was substituted by Cl + OMe (in 14a), 2 &#180; Cl (in 14b), OtBu (in 17a), SPh (in 17b) or SO2Ph (in 17c). The enolates of these ketones were C&#8208;allylated. This furnished the benzene&#8208;fused octa&#8208;1,8&#8208;dienones 7a&#8208;b and 9a&#8208;c, respectively. Ring&#8208;closing meta&#173;theses pro&#173;vided the corresponding benzocycloheptadienones 8a&#8208;b and 10a&#8208;c. Their ke&#173;tone moieties were a,a&#8208;disubstituted (in 8a&#8208;b) or a&#8208;monosub&#173;stituted (in 10a&#8208;c). Each substitution pattern allowed to generate the hydroxy&#173;enone&#160; motif of the corresponding benzocyclo&#173;heptatrienone &#8208; or 6,7&#8208;benzotropolone &#8208; 6a: The MeO&#8208; and PhS&#8208;con&#173;tain&#173;ing benzo&#173;cy&#173;clohep&#173;tadienone 8a gave 6,7&#8208;benztropo&#173;lone methyl ether (15) by sulf&#173;oxide formation and pyrolysis; 15 was demethyl&#173;ated with BCl3. The same in&#173;termediate resulted from the dichloroben&#173;zocy&#173;cloheptadien&#173;one 8b and NaOMe. The benzocyclo&#173;heptadienone 10a was de(tert&#8208;but&#173;ylated) with formic acid; a subse&#173;quent Pfitzner&#8208;Moffatt oxidation com&#173;pleted 6,7&#8208;benzotropolone (6a) once more. The PhS&#8208;containing ben&#173;zocyclo&#173;hep&#173;tadienone 10b was a&#8208;acetoxylated with Pb(OAc)4; the re&#173;sulting O,S&#8208;acetal gave 6,7&#8208;ben&#173;zotropolone (6a) by hydrolysis. The PhSO2&#8208;containing substrate 10c was deprotonated where&#173;upon an ox&#173;idation with Me3Si&#8208;O&#8208;O&#8208;SiMe3 gave 6,7&#8208;benzotrop&#173;olone (6a).</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Access to Unique C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;Acyl Modified Nucleosides through Liebeskind&#8211;Srogl Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient palladium/CuTC cocatalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction procedure for the synthesis of C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;acyl nucleosides from the corresponding nucleoside 5&#8242;&#8208;carbothioates and boronic acids is described. The procedure is fast, efficient, and it tolerates a wide variety of functionalities, thus expanding the so far limited chemical methods for C&#8208;5&#8217; diversification of deoxy&#8208; and ribonucleosides.







Abstract
The chemical functionalization at C&#8208;5&#8217; position of nucleosides has been significantly less studied compared to the C&#8208;1&#8217;, C&#8208;2&#8217; and C&#8208;3&#8217; sugar positions in spite of its potential important role for biological activity. We describe here the synthesis of new carbothioate nucleosides which were then engaged in a Liebeskind&#8208;Srogl reaction with various boronic acids for the preparation of diversely modified C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;acyl nucleosides. Applied to pyrimidine nucleosides in the DNA and RNA series, the reaction showed a broad substrate scope and more than 25 examples were synthesized in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent isolated yields. This general and efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed and Cu(I)&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;coupling represents a convenient method to prepare a diverse set of 5&#8217;&#8208;modified nucleosides and paves the way for further transformation into a variety of potentially bioactive compounds via the possible conversion of the C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;ketone.

         <title>Discrepancy Regarding the Dethreading of a Dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 Macrocycle through a Perfluorobutyl End in [2]Pseudorotaxanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and dethreading study of DB24C8&#8208;based pseudorotaxanes are reported. The pseudorotaxane axles contain ammonium and carbamate stations as well as a repulsive nonafluorobutyl group as one of the two extremities. This extremity prevents any threading of the DB24C8. However, dethreading of pseudorotaxanes is possible and the kinetic rate depends on the presence and localization in the encircled axle of secondary sites of interactions (carbamates).







Abstract
Here are reported the synthesis and characterization of four new dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8)&#8208;based ammonium&#8208;containing pseudorotaxanes, for which one of the two encircled axle's extremities consists of a perfluorobutyl moiety. The subsequent dethreading of the DB24C8 over the perfluorobutyl extremity was studied. Although the perfluorobutyl extremity of an ammonium&#8208;containing axle did not allow threading of DB24C8, dethreading of a perfluorobutyl extremity&#8208;containing pseudorotaxane was possible and its rate depended on both the strength of the template&#8208;to&#8208;DB24C8 complex and the nature of the axle. In particular, dethreading process may be assisted by the presence, in the threaded axle, of a poor secondary site of interaction for the DB24C8 and this assistance proved to be higher when this site is close to the DB24C8.

         <title>Synthesis of Adamantyl H&#8208;Phosphinate Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein described several methods for the preparation of 1&#8208;adamantyl H&#8208;phosphinate esters. Either H&#8208;phosphinic acids are esterified with 1&#8208;adamantanol, or adamantyl hypophosphite reacts through phosphorus&#8208;carbon bond&#8208;formation. Adamantyl esters are significantly less reactive than their primary or secondary alkyl counterparts.







Abstract
Adamantyl H&#8208;phosphinate esters have been described by Leclaire, Giordano, and coworkers as &#8220;universal precursors of P&#8208;stereogenic compounds&#8221; after resolution by chiral HPLC, because these esters resist racemization during displacement with organometallics. In that work, the racemic esters were prepared from phosphorus trichloride or dichlorophosphines (RPCl2). We decided to investigate alternative methods for the preparation of these important precursors. Esterification methods included EDC, PivCl, and T3P. A protocol to avoid chromatographic purification was also developed and used for multigram&#8208;scale synthesis. Finally, adamantyl hypophosphite 1&#8208;AdOP(O)H2 was also prepared and used in the synthesis adamantyl H&#8208;phosphinate esters, thereby providing an alternative to the esterification of H&#8208;phosphinic acids, although 1&#8208;AdOP(O)H2 was much less reactive than other hypophosphite esters.

         <title>Construction of benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles by epoxide &#8211; heteronucleophile cyclization: applications in the synthesis of natural products and designed molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Construction of benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles, specifically which have one or more sp  3  stereogenic carbon atoms on the heterocyclic ring, by intramolecular ring&#8208;opening cyclization of epoxides with  O  &#8208; and  N  &#8208;nucleophiles is a powerful synthetic tool in organic synthesis. In this review, we analyze the efficiency of such a heterocyclization approach in natural product synthesis and synthetic methodologies published since the year 2000. In addition to briefly discussing the synthetic methods of accessing the requisite epoxide substrates, important aspects of the subsequent cyclization reaction, such as reaction conditions,  endo  &#8208; versus  exo  &#8208;regioselectivity, protecting or functional group compatibility, and enantio&#8208; and distereoselectivity are analysed. Noteworthy is that although the literature of organic chemistry in the last four decades has witnessed a large number of reviews/book chapters on epoxide ring&#8208;opening chemistry, this is the first time that the current topic is systematized as a dedicated review.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Symmetrical and Unsymmetrical Thiosulfonates from Disulfides through Electrochemically Induced Disulfide Bond Metathesis and Site&#8208;Selective Oxidation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anodic generation of symmetrical and unsymmetrical thiosulfonates is presented. The principle of the oxidation of symmetrical disulfides was expanded to the conversion of in&#8197;situ generated unsymmetrical disulfides yielding the respective thiosulfonates. A strong dependency of the regioselectivity for the formation of the unsymmetrical thiosulfonates was encountered and allows their regioselective formation in the future.







Abstract
The anodic generation of symmetrical and unsymmetrical thiosulfonates is presented. First, the oxidation of disulfides yielding symmetrical thiosulfonates was realized. The direct synthesis is performed using a simple quasi&#8208;divided cell design, whereby using a supporting electrolyte is unnecessary. Its principle was then expanded to the conversion of unsymmetrical disulfides that were generated in&#8197;situ through metathesis of two symmetrical disulfides. This enables a direct access to unsymmetrical thiosulfonates without any pre&#8208;functionalization or elaborate synthesis of the starting materials for the first time. The reaction scope was investigated by converting differently functionalized aliphatic and aromatic disulfides in moderate to very good yields. Furthermore, a sensitivity assessment for an improved reproducibility and a robustness screen to determine the compatibility of the reaction against functional groups were performed.

The principle of the oxidation of symmetrical disulfides was expanded to the conversion of &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; generated unsymmetrical disulfides yielding the respective thiosulfonates. A strong dependency of the regioselectivity for the formation of the unsymmetrical thiosulfonates was encountered and allows their regioselective formation in the future.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anodic generation of symmetrical and unsymmetrical thiosulfonates is presented. First, the oxidation of disulfides yielding symmetrical thiosulfonates was realized. The direct synthesis is performed using a simple quasi-divided cell design, whereby using a supporting electrolyte is unnecessary. Its principle was then expanded to the conversion of unsymmetrical disulfides that were generated &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; through metathesis of two symmetrical disulfides. This enables a direct access to unsymmetrical thiosulfonates without any pre-functionalization or elaborate synthesis of the starting materials for the first time. The reaction scope was investigated by converting differently functionalized aliphatic and aromatic disulfides in moderate to very good yields. Furthermore, a sensitivity assessment for an improved reproducibility and a robustness screen to determine the compatibility of the reaction against functional groups were performed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Synthesis of a Hexapeptide by Fragment Coupling in a Ball Mill</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using solvent&#8208;less techniques such as ball milling, a hexapeptide was synthesized in gram scale without using any toxic solvents. To date, this hexapeptide is the largest precisely controlled amino acid sequence ever synthesized in a ball mill. This study paves the way to future developments for the synthesis of longer peptides (and proteins) by using ball milling.







Abstract
Synthesis of long peptides is generally considered as a challenge to peptide chemists, in addition to producing significant amounts of toxic waste, such as DMF. Here we show that using solvent&#8208;less methods, such as ball milling, enabled the production of the hexapeptide Boc&#8208;(Ala&#8208;Phe&#8208;Gly)2&#8208;OBn at the gram scale with high overall yield (77&#8201;%, 5 linear steps). This is the longest peptide chain synthesized in a ball mill to date, in which the amino acid sequence is precisely controlled. This study complements the current fundamental knowledge required to synthesize longer and more difficult peptide chains (or small proteins) by using peptide fragment couplings in a ball mill.

         <title>A 2000 to 2020 Practitioner&#8217;s Guide to Chiral Amine Based Enantioselective Aldol Reactions:Common Ketone Substrates,Best Methods,in Water Reaction Environments,and Defining Nuances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We begin with an extensive introduction for the non&#8208;expert regarding enantioselective, amine catalyzed, aldol reactions (Sections 1&#8208;3). There, a broad prospective is provided regarding: methodology limitations, mechanism, in water versus on water definitions and their theoretical basis, small&#8208; and large&#8208;scale physical&#8208;mechanical aspects, solid versus liquid starting material considerations, reproducibility, ball milling, diketone substrates, etc. The thematic emphasis then turns to practical outcomes for the reaction of nineteen aliphatic, cyclic, and aromatic ketones with 4&#8208;nitrobenzaldehyde and benzaldehyde prior to 2021. The ketone substrates are listed in Section 4 of the TOC and their structures are shown in Figure 1. Each ketone is linked to a summary defined by a: (i) schematic, (ii) text summary, (iii) catalyst Figures, and (iv) tabular reaction/product data. Individual ketone summaries, at times, represent the distillation of over six hundred research articles, and the data refinement and its tabular reconstitution is not reproducible using a chemical database search with filters. In the review&#8217;s broadest use, the Figure 1 ketone structures serve as templates to extrapolate to a hypothetical substrate holding more functionality, but of related steric and electronic similarity. This pseudo matching permits a rapid answer to, &#8220;Does this methodology suit the ketone substrate at hand or not?&#8221; In a positive outcome, the best reaction conditions (stoichiometry, catalyst structure and loading, solvent, time, etc.) to affect aldol product formation (yield, dr, and ee) are delineated. A second envisioned use allows the directed construction of diketone substrates (after viewing the tabularized data of Section 4), which then undergo regioselective mono&#8208;aldol product formation. This tactic, reacting one carbonyl moiety while the other remains unreacted, avoids ketone protection&#8208;deprotection, and is shown for the advantageous synthesis of an Alzheimer drug candidate.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein&#8208;Polymer Bioconjugates Prepared by Post&#8208;Polymerization Modification of Alternating Copolymers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward strategy is proposed for the synthesis of protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugates using one of the oldest polymers, the poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride). Different poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) copolymers were successfully prepared by RAFT polymerization in dioxane using the 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;propyl dodecyl trithiocarbonate as chain transfer agent (CTA) and AIBN as initiator. Original biomacromolecules were successfully prepared by post&#8208;polymerization modification.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugates have shown great promise in biomedical and life science applications including drug delivery and diagnosis. The current bioconjugation strategies suffer from lack of efficiency and versatility. In this article, poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) copolymers were first prepared by RAFT polymerization and characterized by different analytical techniques. Then, the poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) precursors were functionalized with primary amine such as azidopropylamine and amino poly(ethylene glycol). The reaction of amino compounds with maleic anhydride was found to be a highly efficient, a versatile, and a facile chemical ligation reaction for the synthesis of macromolecules with quantitative yield under mild conditions. The main benefit is the incorporation of a wide range of functionality by easily changing the primary amine compound. For the amphiphilic graft copolymers based on poly(ethylene glycol), aggregation behavior in water was investigated. In a second part, azido&#8208;functionalized polystyrene copolymers were used to prepare a new protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugate by copper&#8208;free click chemistry reaction.

         <title>Supported Synthesis of Adenosine Nucleotides and Derivatives on a Benzene&#8208;Centered Tripodal Soluble Support</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy based on anchoring C(6) azidopurine nucleoside derivative to a tripodal soluble support allows to access the corresponding adenosine nucleotides. We extended the scope of the method to methylene bisphosphonate analogues and N6&#8208;benzylamine derivative.







Abstract
The first soluble&#8208;phase synthesis of adenosine nucleotides including &#945;,&#946; and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;methylene bisphosphonate analogues on a multi&#8208;pod support is reported. Anchoring of a 2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;protected purine nucleoside to the tripodal support via the nucleobase was successfully achieved using a microwave assisted Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition. Then, phosphorylation was performed, followed by cleavage with aqueous ammonia to provide adenine derivatives, and finally deprotection. When using benzylamine instead of ammonia, a derivative with N6&#8208;benzylamine adenine as nucleobase was obtained. This methodology allows to access adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;mono, di and triphosphates, as well as various analogues of pharmacological interest in modest to good yields.
