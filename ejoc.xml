         <title>Synergic Palladium Catalysis for Aerobic Oxidative Coupling</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aerobic oxidative coupling is a dehydrogenative organic transformation in which molecular oxygen acts as a re&#8208;oxidant for the catalyst system. Pd has emerged as one of the most popular transition metal catalysts for such reactions. Combinations of Pd with other transition metal catalysts can also provide effective catalytic cycles together with highly atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical organic transformations. A synergic Pd catalyst system can promote such reactions with a high degree of efficiency based on a re&#8208;oxidation step exhibiting improved kinetics in which two electrons are transferred from another transition metal. This occurs in conjunction with a lower energy barrier than that associated with direct re&#8208;oxidation by molecular oxygen. This review highlights recent developments in aerobic oxidative coupling reactions catalyzed by synergic combinations of Pd with other transition metals. Highlighted reactions include dehydrogenative C&#8208;C bond formation such as arylation of arenes, heteroarenes, alkenes and dehydrogenative C&#8208;N and C&#8208;O bond formations with unsaturated hydrocarbons such as alkenes, 1,3&#8208;dienes and allenes. Moreover, mechanistic insights into these aerobic reactions based on experimental, computational and optical studies are detailed.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactions of Enaminones with p&#8208;Quinone Methides: Access to 4H&#8208;Chromene and 4H&#8208;Chromen&#8208;4&#8208;one Derivatives</title>

         <dc:description>A one&#8208;pot approach for the synthesis of oxygencontaining heterocycles such as 4H&#8208;chromenes and 4Hchromen&#8208;4&#8208;ones has been established through the reaction of enaminones with  p  &#8208;quinone methides (  p  &#8208;QMs). This transformation basically involves an acid&#8208;catalyzed 1,6conjugate addition of enaminones to  p  &#8208;QMs followed by annulation. In the case of reaction between 2hydroxyphenyl&#8208;substituted  p  &#8208;quinone methides and  N  ,  N  dimethyl enaminones, 4H&#8208;chromene derivatives were obtained in moderate to excellent yields. Similarly, the reaction between simple  p  &#8208;quinone methides and 2hydroxyphenyl&#8208;substituted  N  ,  N  &#8208;dimethyl enaminones led to 4H&#8208;chromen&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives in good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>A Clickable Bioorthogonal Sydnone&#8208;Aglycone for the Facile Preparation of a Core 1 O&#8208;Glycan&#8208;Array</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 27, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small library of sydnone&#8208;modified mucin&#8208;type O&#8208;glycan structures were synthesized chemoenzymatically, allowing for the facile preparation of O&#8208;glycan&#8208;array, by means of metal&#8208;free strain&#8208;promoted sydnone&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPSAC), for studying O&#8208;glycan&#8208;protein interactions.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylation has been shown to be essential for many biological processes. However, determining the exact relationship between O&#8208;glycan structures and their biological activity remains challenging. Here we report that, unlike azides, sydnones can be incorporated as an aglycon into core 1 O&#8208;glycans early&#8208;on in their synthesis since it is compatible with carbohydrate chemistry and enzymatic glycosylations, allowing us to generate a small library of sydnone&#8208;containing core 1 O&#8208;glycans by chemoenzymatic synthesis. The sydnone&#8208;aglycon was then employed for the facile preparation of an O&#8208;glycan array, via bioorthogonal strain&#8208;promoted sydnone&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition click reaction, and in turn was utilized for the high&#8208;throughput screening of O&#8208;glycan&#8208;lectin interactions. This sydnone&#8208;aglycon, particularly adapted for O&#8208;glycomics, is a valuable chemical tool that complements the limited technologies available for investigating O&#8208;glycan structure&#8208;activity relationships.

         <title>Access to Sulfocoumarins by Three&#8208;Component Reaction of &#946;&#8208;Keto Sulfonyl Fluorides, Arynes, and DMF</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 27, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synthesis of sulfocoumarins by three&#8208;component reaction of &#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides, arynes and DMF is reported. The reaction proceeds via trapping of the in&#8197;situ generated o&#8208;quinone methides with &#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides, followed by selective cyclization with sulfonyl fluorides. This strategy provides a new avenue to access diverse sulfocoumarins under mild conditions.







Abstract
Sulfonyl fluorides have found diverse applications in multiple disciplines due to their reactivity and stability. Thus, exploiting the new reactivity of sulfonyl fluorides is of high importance to Sulfur (VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) chemistry. Reported herein is a three&#8208;component reaction of &#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides, arynes and DMF for the streamline synthesis of sulfocoumarins. The reaction proceeds by trapping of the in&#8197;situ generated o&#8208;quinone methides with &#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides, followed by selective cyclization with sulfonyl fluorides. This strategy provides a new avenue to access diverse sulfocoumarins with under mild conditions.

Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination of 1,3,5&#8208;tribromobenzene with commercially available or easily prepared amino&#8208;pyridine derivatives and consecutive N&#8722;H/C&#8722;H coupling using a hypervalent iodine reagent realized a two&#8208;step protocol for various polyazatruxenes. The quantum yield of the hexaazatruxene reached ca. 0.80.







Abstract
Truxene is a C3&#8208;symmetric compound with characteristic photophysical properties, and it has great potential as a light&#8208;emitting material and building block. In this study, we demonstrate the synthesis of hexaazatruxenes using a two&#8208;step protocol. First, the hexaazatruxene precursors were prepared through the Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination of 1,3,5&#8208;tribromobenzene with commercially available or easily prepared amino&#8208;pyridine derivatives. Then, hexaazatruxenes were synthesized through consecutive N&#8722;H/C&#8722;H coupling using a hypervalent iodine reagent. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the synthesis of truxenes containing more than three heteroatoms in the main skeleton.

         <title>Dual Catalysis in Rhodium(II) Carbenoid Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 27, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review describes the recent developments of dual catalysis in rhodium (II) carbenoid chemistry, where rhodium is cooperatively working with a second transition metal (Sc/Pd/Ag/Au) or organocatalyst. The redox compatibility, turnover pathways, and the generation of unique rhodium&#8208;bound zwitterionic intermediates make rhodium an attractive partner for dual catalysis reactions to enable new transformations.







Abstract
Dual catalysis represents an alternative archetype in carbene chemistry that surpasses traditional single catalyst systems. By employing dual catalyst systems, one can improve the efficiency of existing reactions and enable new chemical transformations. Reactions involving dual synergistic catalysis are increasingly valuable as they offer convenient strategies for synthesizing challenging quaternary carbon centers and bioactive core structures. This review article focuses on trapping diazo&#8208;derived, rhodium (II) zwitterionic intermediates with varying electrophiles such as Michael acceptors, alkynes, &#960;&#8208;allyl Pd(II) complexes, and the Nicholas intermediate.

The Front Cover illustrates a dual catalyst system that minimizes the activation energy to enable new synthetic transformations. Here, a gentleman attempts to pick fruits from a tree; however, his height with a box (representing Rh (II)) is insufficient to reach the fruit. Beside him, a woman attempts to pick fruit &#8211; but alas, this box (catalyst II) is also inadequate! Only the lady using both boxes can reach the fruit, indicating the need for a dual catalytic system. More information can be found in the Review by I. Sharma et&#8197;al.

         <title>Synthesis of Fungal Cell Wall Oligosaccharides and Their Ability to Trigger Plant Immune Responses</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 27, July 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Automated glycan assembly and solution&#8208;phase synthesis provided a set of fungal cell wall oligosaccharides that were investigated for their ability to activate the plant immune system. Synthetic chitin and &#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;glucan oligosaccharides triggered mitogen&#8208;activated protein kinase phosphorylation and a reactive oxygen burst in Arabidopsis seedlings.







Abstract
Oligosaccharide fragments of fungal cell wall glycans are important molecular probes for studying both the biology of fungi and fungal infections of humans, animals, and plants. The fungal cell wall contains large amounts of various polysaccharides that are ligands for pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), eliciting an immune response upon recognition. Towards the establishment of a glycan array platform for the identification of new ligands of plant PRRs, tri&#8208;, penta&#8208;, and heptasaccharide fragments of different cell wall polysaccharides were prepared. Chito&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;(1&#8594;6)&#8208;gluco&#8208;oligosaccharides were synthesized by automated glycan assembly (AGA), and &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;gluco&#8208;oligosaccharides were synthesized in solution using a recently reported highly &#945;&#8208;selective glycosylation methodology. Incubation of plants with the synthesized oligosaccharides revealed i) length dependence for plant activation by chito&#8208;oligosaccharides and ii) &#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;glucan oligosaccharides as a new class of glycans capable of triggering plant activation.

         <title>Catalytic Isomerization of Unprotected Mesoionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins and Their Lewis Adducts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extensive DFT calculations show that the isomerization of C5&#8208;unprotected mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (mNHOs) to more Lewis basic mesoionic carbenes (MICs) can be efficiently catalyzed by weakly protic acidic species including unprotected mNHO, MIC, their Lewis adducts and polar H2O molecules, thus enabling catalytic isomerization and H&#8208;isotope exchange reactions of such mNHOs and their Lewis adducts.







Abstract
Recently, novel C5&#8208;position&#8208;unprotected mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (mNHOs) demonstrated interesting reactivity with various Lewis acids during experiments. In this work, extensive DFT calculations show that the isomerization of such mNHOs to more Lewis&#8208;basic mesoionic carbenes (MICs) can be efficiently catalyzed by weakly protic acidic species including C5&#8208;unprotected mNHOs, their Lewis adducts and polar H2O molecules, thus enabling catalytic isomerization and H&#8208;isotope exchange of such mNHOs and their Lewis adducts.

         <title>A Green Multicomponent Domino Mannich&#8208;Michael Reaction to Synthesize Novel Naphthoquinone&#8208;Polyphenols with Antiproliferative and Antioxidant Activities</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>

This work describes a new methodology to synthesize novel naphthoquinone polyphenols. These compounds were submitted to CRAC assays, and, in general, showed antioxidant activities superior to Trolox. In addition, the antiproliferative activity of the most active compounds showed IC50 values for HCT116 and PC3 comparable to those of 5&#8208;fluorouracil and superior to doxorubicin in HL60 and SNB19 human cancer cells.







Abstract
This study reports on the one&#8208;step, green, catalyst&#8208;free synthesis of new naphthoquinone&#8208;polyphenols through an innovative method using the multicomponent domino Mannich&#8211;Michael reaction in the lawsone. After optimized condition reactions, twelve novel naphthoquinone polyphenols were synthesized with good yields. The polyphenols were tested on four cancer cell lines (HCT116, PC3, HL60, and SNB19), in which the best results showed antiproliferative activity with IC50 of 25.83&#8211;47.95&#8197;&#956;M. Additionally, we used the CRAC assay to quantify the antioxidant capacity of each compound and determined a hierarchy based on the Trolox equivalent values.

         <title>H&#8208;Bonded Counterion&#8208;Directed Catalysis: Enantioselective Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Addition to 2&#8208;Alkynyl Enones as a Case Study</title>

         <dc:description>
H&#8208;bonded counterion&#8208;directed catalysis has been applied to the enantioselective tandem cycloisomerization&#8208;addition to 2&#8208;alkynyl enones. The addition of C&#8208;, N&#8208; or O&#8208;centered nucleophiles catalyzed by a phosphinosquaramide Au(I) chloride/chiral Ag(I) phosphoramidate system afforded bicyclic furans in moderate to excellent yield and enantioselectivity (28 examples, 59&#8211;96&#8201;% yield, 62&#8201;:&#8201;38 to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 er).







Abstract
H&#8208;bonded counterion&#8208;directed catalysis (HCDC) is a strategy wherein a chiral anion that is hydrogen&#8208;bonded to the achiral ligand of a metal complex is responsible for enantioinduction. In this article we present the application of H&#8208;bonded counterion&#8208;directed catalysis to the Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective tandem cycloisomerization&#8208;addition reaction of 2&#8208;alkynyl enones. Following the addition of C&#8208;, N&#8208; or O&#8208;centered nucleophiles, bicyclic furans were obtained in moderate to excellent yield and enantioselectivity (28 examples, 59&#8211;96&#8201;% yield, 62&#8201;:&#8201;38 to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 er). The optimal catalytic system, comprising a phosphinosquaramide Au(I) chloride complex and a BINOL&#8208;derived phosphoramidate Ag(I) salt, was selected in a combinatorial fashion from a larger library with the help of high&#8208;throughput screening. An enantioselectivity switch of ca. 120 &#916;ee% was observed upon addition of the achiral Au(I) component to the Ag(I) salt.

         <title>Reassignment of Improbable Natural Products Identified through Chemical Principle Screening</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure elucidation of complex natural products remains exceedingly reliant on a multitude of spectroscopic outputs, resulting in an elevated propensity to propose erroneous solutions. In this work concepts aimed to assist practitioners in identifying erroneous chemical structures are presented, along with nine examples to demonstrate approaches to solve and reassign natural product chemical structure employing a combination of CASE and DFT spectrum prediction with chemical intuition oversight.







Abstract
Natural products continue to be reported at an astonishing rate from a wide range of multidisciplinary research activities in the pursuit of understanding the chemistry of biodiversity. However, the elucidation of chemical structure in the modern era is heavily reliant on the analysis and interpretation of multiple spectroscopic outputs, and in most cases this activity is by no means trivial. Structural errors continue to be described given the inherent complexity of natural products. Computer&#8208;Assisted Structure Elucidation (CASE) continues to provide improved resolving power in this regard, but for enhanced accuracy quantum chemical spectrum prediction methodology is paramount. Reported herein are a range of counterfactual natural products, identified through chemical principal screening, which have been reassigned using a combination of chemical intuition, chemical synthesis, CASE and DU8+ spectrum prediction.

         <title>C&#8208;S cross&#8208;coupling reactions catalyzed by well&#8208;defined copper and nickel complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This minireview presents well&#8208;defined copper and nickel complexes that have been used in the formation of C&#8208;S bonds. The use of Cu or Ni catalysts represent an advantage in comparison with those based on precious metals such as Pd, by being two of the most abundant metals in the earth&#8217;s crust and thus cheaper. As can be expected the catalytic activity of the different Cu and Ni complexes is strongly dependent on the nature of the ligands used. Thus, multidentate and strong electron&#8208;donating ligands are of common use to design highly active species since such ligands are capable to stabilize species in high oxidation states which are key intermediates in the reaction mechanisms of these processes. This being particular true in the case of copper, where Cu(III) produces unstable and reactive species that require an &#8220;extra stabilization&#8221; during the reaction mechanism. Hence, the reaction mechanisms using copper and nickel complexes as catalysts are also discussed in this paper, including the role of the different ligands during the catalytic processes. Although there are an increasing number of reports on C&#8208;S cross coupling reactions, due to the relevance of this transformation, they are often difficult to reproduce and not of general use due to the fact that the actual catalytic species are not identified, thus we hope that this report will help to promote the search and synthesis of new ligands for the design of more active well defined complexes that can be used as catalysts in a more rationale manner in the formation of valuable C&#8208;S bond containing species.</dc:description>

         <title>Studies Towards the Total Synthesis of Amycolamicin: A Chiral Auxiliary&#8208;Based Diels&#8208;Alder Approach towards the Decalin Core</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stereoselective synthesis of (1  S  ,2  S  ,5  R  )&#8208;5&#8208;((4&#8208;methoxybenzyl)oxy)&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;8&#8208;methylene&#8208;1,2,4a,5,6,7,8,8a&#8208;octahy&#8208;dronaphthalene&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acid (  2  ) is described, which comprises the bicyclic core structure of the natural product amycolamicin (  1  ). The bicyclic ring&#8208;system was established  via  an intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of a triene carrying a SuperQuat chiral auxiliary. The latter could be readily removed by methanolysis in excellent yield, which allowed for effective conversion of a hydroxy group at C(8) into the methylene group present in the natural product. The intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reaction could also be performed with a triene incorporating a classical, phenylalanine&#8208;derived Evans auxiliary, but the removal of the latter from the initial Diels&#8208;Alder product was hampered by competing attack of nucleophiles on the endocyclic carbonyl group in the oxazolidinone ring. Acid  2  could be converted into an acyl cyanide that features as a key advanced intermediate in one of the three total syntheses of amycolamicin reported to date.</dc:description>

Acid  2  could be converted into an acyl cyanide that features as a key advanced intermediate in one of the three total syntheses of amycolamicin reported to date.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Commercially available arylboronic acids can easily be converted into chiral boronic esters which can be subjected to Matteson homologations using Grignard reagents. Best results are obtained in one pot protocols without isolation of the a&#8208;chloroboronic ester intermediates. Alkoxides can also be used as nucleophilies, but the corresponsing homologated boronic esters are found to be not stable.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Dual Catalytic Synthesis of Heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, synergistic dual catalysis has been in the spotlight as a robust strategy for carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond formation. This review highlights the unique strategies of dual catalysis achieved in the past two decades, involving Pd&#8208;catalyst combined with various first&#8208; and second&#8208;row transition metals (like Cr, Fe, Cu, Ru, etc.), Lewis acids (based on Yb, Mg, Ti, Al, etc.) or organocatalysts (like squaramide, CPA, and NHC) to achieve valuable heterocyclic cores. Heterocycles find wide applications in pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. Several organocatalysts like chiral phosphoric acid, NHC, squaramide, etc., and metal salts work in synergy with palladium to provide high&#8208;value products taking advantage of the vast development in cross&#8208;coupling reactions. This review is a comprehensive collection of such dual&#8208;catalysis strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Properties of a Trigonal Iminoboronate Ester Cage Self&#8208;Assembled from Hexahydroxytriphenylene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembly of 1,3&#8208;diaminopropane (DAP), 2&#8208;formylphenylboronic acid (FPBA) and 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) into a trigonal&#8208;prismatic molecular cage through reversible iminoboronate ester motifs is reported. The organic cage generates solvates with acetonitrile and nitrobenzene, exhibiting vapochromic behavior. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis evidenced the inclusion of nitrobenzene within the cage cavity. The resulting host&#8208;guest complex is stabilized by donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor interactions between the nitrobenzene guest and the &#960; electron&#8208;rich HHTP units of the cage.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A novel, safe, convenient and efficient protocol for regioselective chlorination of imidazo&#8208;fused heterocycles with dichloro(4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)&#8208;&#955;3  &#8208;iodanes has been developed under very mild conditions. The present approach avoids the need of toxic chlorinating reagents, strong stoichiometric oxidants, metal catalysts and harsh reaction conditions. And 36 examples of imidazo&#8208;fused heterocycle substrates were investigated to deliver the chlorinated products with in moderate to excellent yields.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative transformation of indoles is a promising approach for synthesizing valuable nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds; however, conventional methods use toxic oxidants and additives. Herein, we report for the first time the catalytic oxidative trimerization and the oxygenative cleavage (Witkop oxidation) of indoles using molecular oxygen under additive&#8208;free conditions accomplished by a copper nitride nanocube (Cu3N NC) catalyst. The Cu3N NC catalyst exhibits excellent activity to produce various indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones and 2&#8208;ketoanilides with high functional group tolerance. Owing to this excellent catalytic performance, the Cu3N NC catalyst is distinguished from the conventional copper catalysts, demonstrating the high catalytic potential of metal nitride in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Pseudo&#8208;Terpenoids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;pot synthesis of terpenoids: An organocatalytic coupling and annulation methodology was developed for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of structurally complex cedrane scaffolds in very good yields with high chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. It represents a highly economical, novel, and green method for the cedrane scaffolds synthesis.







Abstract
Structurally complex cedrane scaffolds were synthesized in very good yields with high chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivities in a sequential one&#8208;pot manner. A combination of intermolecular olefination, intramolecular Michael and Michael reactions or intermolecular olefination, intramolecular Michael and aldol reactions were used as the key steps from the readily available hydroxy&#8208;p&#8208;quinone butanals and phosphoranes with catalytic amounts of quinine at ambient temperatures for a few hours. This is a unique one&#8208;pot combination of coupling and annulation routes for the green synthesis of a library of tricyclic pseudo&#8208;terpenoids (cedrane scaffolds) with high selectivity and yields. Organocatalytic ring isomerization was highlighted through transforming one ring into another one by retro&#8208;cyclization. We have discussed thoroughly mechanistic aspects of these tandem coupling/annulation and ring isomerization reactions based on control experiments and X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis.

         <title>Dual Metallaphotoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Directed C(sp2)&#8722;H Functionalization: Access to C&#8722;C/C&#8208;Heteroatom Bonds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines a handful of transformations employing transition&#8208;metal and photoredox catalysis by auxiliary&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H activation strategy to assemble synthetic libraries of C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. The review also features the substrate scope and mechanistic insights of the key methodologies.







Abstract
Metallaphotoredox catalysis represents the combination of two activation modes: metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization and visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photocatalysis. This appealing dual catalysis technique has evolved as a versatile platform that has paved the way for diverse low&#8208;energy pathways for a plethora of synthetic transformations. The synergistic combination of two &#8220;green&#8221; approaches has garnered enormous interest owing to the development of sustainable strategies.

     alt="Dual Metallaphotoredox-Catalyzed Directed C(sp2)&#8722;H Functionalization: Access to C&#8722;C/C-Heteroatom Bonds"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review outlines a handful of transformations employing transition-metal and photoredox catalysis by auxiliary-assisted C&#8722;H activation strategy to assemble synthetic libraries of C&#8722;C and C-heteroatom bonds. The review also features the substrate scope and mechanistic insights of the key methodologies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metallaphotoredox catalysis represents the combination of two activation modes: metal-catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization and visible-light-induced photocatalysis. This appealing dual catalysis technique has evolved as a versatile platform that has paved the way for diverse low-energy pathways for a plethora of synthetic transformations. The synergistic combination of two &#8220;green&#8221; approaches has garnered enormous interest owing to the development of sustainable strategies. In the recent past, significant advancements have been accomplished in constructing site-selective C&#8722;C and C-heteroatom bonds. This review outlines the use of photoredox catalysis in directing group-assisted C&#8722;H functionalization reactions. The mechanistic insights of the developments and synthetic applications are addressed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The review discusses the recent developments in the field of synthetic chemistry of PAH&#8208;porphyrin hybrids, emphasizing phenanthrene&#8208;embedded carbaporphyrinoids and related systems. The discussion covers various aspects of phenanthriporphyrin and its derivates chemistry, including their spectroscopic features, aromaticity, core reactivity, and coordination properties. The development of expanded phenanthriporphyrinoids is outlined, followed by the presentation of related carbaporphyrinoids incorporating hydrocarbon moieties such as fluorene, biphenyl, terphenyl, and dibenzo[  g  ,  p  ]chrysene. The exploitation of phenanthriporphyrinoids as a unique class of ligands for organometallic chemistry is discussed, with their use for the construction of conformational and stereochemical switches. The perspective for using related macrocycles as building blocks for carbaporphyrinoid cages is also outlined.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Activity of Triphenylphosphine and Potassium Iodide system in the Decarboxylative Alkylation of 3&#8208;Cyanochromones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic decarboxylative alkylation of 3&#8208;cyanochromone using triphenylphosphine and potassium iodide as photoredox&#8208;mediators have been described. Low price of potassium iodide as well as triphenylphosphine compared to standard photocatalysts, made this method cost&#8208;effective and interesting. Visible light, cheap and readily available substrates, anhydrous solvent and inert atmosphere constitute the key parameters for the success of the developed transformation. The method allows for obtaining a number of products with very good yield and benefits from broad scope including both  N  &#8208;(acyloxy)phthalimides and 3&#8208;cyanochromones.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically Hindered 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;Hydroxyphenyl)benzoxazole (HBO) Emitters: Synthesis, Spectroscopic Studies, and Theoretical Calculations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe various synthetic pathways to introduce sterically hindered substituents (mesityl, 2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl, anthracene) to the proton donor side of excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT)&#8208;capable 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) benzoxazole (HBO) fluorophores. Two original synthetic approaches were investigated in order to synthesize seven HBO derivatives. Optimization studies concluded that electron rich and bulky phosphine ligands such as SPhos or S&#8208;bidime are required to ensure completion of the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction involving a bulky aromatic boronic acid. The photophysical properties of all dyes were evaluated in toluene, ethanol and in the solid&#8208;state. A strong influence of the nature of the solvent on the optical properties was evidenced, as protic solvents tend to stabilize enol tautomers and induce dual emission. Unlike the majority of organic dyes, ESIPT fluorophores do not undergo &#960;&#8208;stacking in the solid&#8208;state which led to a mild influence of steric hindrance. The nature of the excited&#8208;states was explored by  ab initio  calculations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Thiyl radicals by far have taken part in manifold natural processes with regard to biochemistry. Utilizing their capability of reversibly adding onto carbon&#8722;carbon double bond may be able to create valuable transformations.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of 2,6&#8208;Disubstituted Cuneanes through Enantioselective Constitutional Isomerization of 1,4&#8208;Disubstituted Cubanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2,6&#8208;Substituted cuneanes were obtained by metal&#8208;catalyzed isomerization of 1,4&#8208;disubstituted cubanes and are stable cage&#8208;like hexahedral compounds with C2v symmetry. In this process, the chiral cage&#8208;like hexahedral hydrocarbon in one step. The asymmetric induction was performed using chiral P&#8722;C&#8722;P pincer Pd catalyst. The obtained cuneane will be a novel chiral scaffold.







Abstract
2,6&#8208;Disubstituted cuneane has potential as a p&#8208;disubstituted benzene bioisostere and a novel chiral scaffold. It is a constitutional isomer of a 1,4&#8208;disubstituted cubane obtained via a metal&#8208;catalyzed skeletal rearrangement. Unlike the highly symmetrical 1,4&#8208;disubstituted cubane, the isomerized 2,6&#8208;disubstituted cuneane is a chiral molecule possessing C2 symmetry. Examining various chiral catalysts revealed that the Pd&#8208;pincer catalyst provides a good asymmetric induction.

         <title>Rapid Synthesis of Fused Polycyclic Heteroaromatics via Successive Vinylic/Aromatic C&#8211;F Bond Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of fused polycyclic heteroaromatics was achieved via successive vinylic / aromatic carbon&#8211;fluorine (C&#8211;F) bond activation. The Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of (1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluorovinyl)biaryls with 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208; or 2&#8208;aminophenylboronic acids (esters) followed by defluorinative 5&#8208; endo &#8208; trig cyclization yielded 2&#8208;fluorobenzofurans (indoles) with a biaryl moiety in one&#8208;pot operation. The obtained 2&#8208;fluorobenzoheteroles underwent acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular C&#8211;F/C&#8211;H coupling to yield tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208;, and hexacyclic heteroaromatics. This protocol allowed the synthesis of various substituted benzo&#8208;fused dibenzofurans and carbazoles.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dual&#8208;catalysis tactics where two types of catalysts are connected in one single reaction operation are highly prized in the novel bond constructions that are difficult or unattainable to be achieved with current mono&#8208;catalysis. In recent years, increased emphasis on sustainable catalytic methods on more economic and eco&#8208;friendly processes has shifted the focus to catalysis with earth&#8208;abundant transition metals, such as iron, copper, etc. As two of the most inexpensive and environmentally friendly metals on earth, the research and development based on either iron or copper catalysis are flourishing, and iron&#8208;copper dual&#8208;catalyzed reactions appeal more and more attention. In this review, we mainly cover the construction of C&#8208;C, C&#8208;H, C&#8208;N, C&#8208;B, C&#8208;P, C&#8208;S and C&#8208;Sn bonds enabled by iron&#8208;copper dual&#8208;catalysis published in the literature from 2011.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, an efficient method for both aryl C(sp  2  )&#8208;S and C(sp)&#8208; C(sp) bond formation to construct both diaryl thioethers and 1,3&#8208;diynes in excellent yield from spirocyclic &#955;  3  &#8208;iodanes and benzenethiols under copper(I) catalysed conditions, has been developed.

Bench stable TsONHBoc is easy to use and it produces a non&#8208;interfering water&#8208;soluble by&#8208;product.  The protocol is operative for both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient aryl boronic acids under acidic conditions, where the former arenes affords a better yield of the desired product. Even, sterically hindered and halogenated substrates are easily amenable under this reaction condition. The current protocol can be scaled up to produce gram&#8208;scale primary aromatic amines.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Aryl Lactams by Heck&#8208;Matsuda and Heck&#8208;Mizoroki Arylations of Enelactams</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chiral aryl lactam nucleus is a common motif present in many bioactive natural products and the development of effective enantioselective methodologies for its preparation is of great interest. In this work, we report the synthesis of several enantioenriched aryl lactams in good yields and enantiomeric ratios using a combined strategy employing arenediazonium salts bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents, aryl iodides with electron&#8208;donating substituents, and chiral  N  ,  N  &#8208;ligands. The chiral &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aryl lactams were obtained in yields of up to 78% and enantiomeric ratios up to 95:5. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the use of chiral  N  ,  N  &#8208;ligands as a viable alternative to the phosphine&#8208;based ligands in the enantioselective Heck&#8208;Mizoroki reactions using aryl iodides. The origins of the enantioselectivity and the full catalytic cycle for the Heck&#8208;Matsuda arylation of the enelactams were investigated through DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of organoboron compounds have attracted&#160;the attention of the synthetic community. In particular, molecules with&#160;C(sp  2  )&#8208;B bonds enable the transformation to new C&#8208;C or C&#8208;heteroatom&#160;bonds by well&#8208;established methodologies. Alkenyl&#160;boronates have the possibility for further conversion of the boron&#160;moiety or functionalization of the double bond. This review gives an&#160;overview on the recent methodologies for the selective preparation of&#160;the challenging highly substituted alkenyl boronates from alkynes.</dc:description>

         <title>7,12&#8208;Dihydrobenzo[de]indolo[3,2&#8208;b]quinoline: Unique Reactivity&#160;and Redox Interconversion</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acetyl&#8208;substituted 7,12&#8208;dihydrobenzo[ de ]indolo[3,2&#8208; b ]quinoline was developed as a N &#8208;substituted polycyclic heteroaromatic molecule via Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclo&#8208;isomerization of an alkyne precursor, followed by intramolecular Goldberg amination. This compound showed unique reactivity, notably, base&#8208;mediated deacetylative oxygenation and photo&#8208;Fries rearrangement. A series of products exhibited characteristic electronic properties based on the redox state of the corresponding nitrogen atoms. The photo&#8208;rearranged product, which possesses a 1,2&#8208;diaminoethene substructure, akin to the redox functionality of the natural flavin adenine dinucleotide, underwent reversible interconversion with the corresponding oxidized form. The efficient stabilization of the highly electron&#8208;rich 7,12&#8208;dihydrobenzo[ de ]indolo[3,2&#8208; b ]quinoline skeleton was ascribed to the electron&#8208;withdrawing effect, intramolecular hydrogen bonding of the acetyl group, and local aromatic stabilization in the indole moiety.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Bioactivity Relationship in Cyclic Peptoids: An Overview</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic  N  &#8208;substituted glycines oligomers, also known as cyclic peptoids, constitute a promising class of novel peptidomimetics, capable of simulating bioactive effectors with enhanced proteolytical stability and cell permeability as crucial bonuses. The macrocyclic constraint, essential for the induction of stable secondary structures, determines the biomimetic potential of such molecules, which act as antimicrobials, cytotoxic agents, siderophores, glycosidases inhibitors and so on. The bioactivity can be either attributed to the macrocyclic core (especially chelation) or to the side&#8208;chains (when endowed with specific groups or pharmacophores). The structure&#8208;bioactivity correlations emerging for this class of peptidomimetics, based on the study of conformational order and morphology of the backbone architecture, unravel interesting avenues for the rational design of more effective cyclooligomeric biomimics.</dc:description>

         <title>a&#8208;Ketobutyrate Production under Continuous&#8208;Flow conditions Catalyzed by Immobilized L&#8208;Methionine &#947;&#8208;Lyase</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>L&#8208;Methionine &#947;&#8208;lyase (MGL) is a PLP&#8208;dependent enzyme which catalyzes the &#945;, &#947;&#8208;elimination reaction in sulfur containing amino acids such as L&#8208;methionine and L&#8208;cysteine. Its major applications are on metabolic restriction of methionine to cancer cells, food industry (cheese flavor) and for the synthesis of D and L&#8208;homoalanine. Herein we present the immobilization and use of this new immobilized biocatalyst under batch and continuous&#8208;flow conditions. The best optimized continuous&#8208;flow condition allowed 89% conversion in 30 minutes of residence time with good recyclability of the biocatalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions and Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis: A Convenient Blend</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed, C&#8211;C and C&#8211;N bond&#8208;forming reactions have made an enormous impact in the way complex molecules are assembled. The benefits of solid&#8208;phase chemistry soon made this type of reaction applicable to solid&#8208;supported processes. In this review, we report the most recent applications and possibilities of this combination. Remarkably, the solid&#8208;phase CuAAC and ring&#8208;closing metathesis have demonstrated an important role in synthetic biology, alike more traditional Pd&#8208;catalyzed reactions, such as Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura, Heck, Sonogashira, which are valuable tools for accessing libraries of biologically relevant small molecules. Examples proved the validity of solid&#8208;phase transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions as a practical and fast strategy to cover the current organic chemistry demands.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Synthesis of Thiiranes from Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, sustainable and efficient organocatalytic synthesis of thiiranes from alkenes has been developed. Starting from olefins and utilizing the epoxidation protocol developed in the Kokotos&#8217; group, which employs 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroacetophenone as the organocatalyst and H2O2 as the oxidant, followed by ring opening by thiourea, a variety of thiiranes were synthesized in moderate to excellent yields.







Abstract
Thiiranes, the corresponding sulfur analogues of epoxides, are less studied and less encountered in literature. This might be due to the limited existing synthetic approaches for their synthesis. Herein, a mild, sustainable and efficient organocatalytic synthesis of thiiranes has been developed. Starting from olefins and utilizing the epoxidation protocol developed in the Kokotos&#8217; group, which employs 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroacetophenone as the organocatalyst and H2O2 as the oxidant, followed by ring opening by thiourea, a variety of thiiranes were synthesized. Both aromatic and aliphatic moieties are well tolerated, leading to thiiranes in moderate to excellent yields.

         <title>Diversity&#8208;Oriented Synthesis and Chemoinformatics: A Fruitful Synergy towards Better Chemical Libraries</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In these two decades, Diversity Oriented Syntesis (DOS) has evolved significantly. A shift in the focus of DOS library design was observed, passing from structural diversity to biological relevance. New approaches have been developed taking advantage of chemoinformatics tools, in order to increase the biological outcome of the library.







Abstract
In these two decades, Diversity&#8208;Oriented Synthesis (DOS) has changed significantly: from the historical focus on structural diversity, new approaches have been developed in order to increase the biological outcome of the molecules within the library, such as the privileged&#8208;based DOS or the Diversity&#8208;Oriented Fluorescence Library Approach (DOFLA). In this context, chemoinformatics can assist organic chemists in identifying biologically&#8208;relevant regions of the chemical space not yet explored. Also, chemoinformatics tools can be used to graphically visualize and/or predict the structural diversity and complexity of the compounds within the library. This review highlights the improvement that DOS has received from chemoinformatics, presenting recent articles (published between 2016 and 2021) in which DOS libraries are analysed by chemoinformatics tools.

         <title>A Steroidal Molecular Rotor with Fast Solid&#8208;State Dynamics Obtained by Crystal Engineering: Role of the Polarity of the Stator</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theoretical/experimental study is presented for a set of Steroidal Molecular Rotors (SMRs). Extensive DFT computations and SXRD experiments revealed a potential correlation between the polarity of the stator and the rotational activation energy. Following this crystal engineering criterium we report a rare example of a SMR with fast rotational dynamics in spite of featuring a crystallographically crowded rotator.







Abstract
A set of Steroidal Molecular Rotors (SMRs) were synthesized and characterized employing a Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction as the key synthetic step. The static dipole moment (&#956;0) of the stator was examined as a crystal engineering criterium that could determine the easiness with which the rotator participates in the high energy supramolecular interactions that frequently preclude rotation in this class of molecular machines. The strategy is critically evaluated through theoretical/experimental analyses, featuring SXRD experiments and QM/MM computations of the rotational activation energy (Ea), allowing us to propose, within the systems studied, a potential correlation between the use of stators with lower &#956;0 and a lowering of the Ea value. Results from solid&#8208;state NMR revealed that one of the most promising compounds indeed hosts fast rotational motion (above 25&#8211;30&#8197;kHz), standing as a rare example of a SMR with fast rotation within a crowded crystallographic environment.

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Diversity&#8208;Oriented Synthesis of Dinaphthothiepine Bisimides as Soluble Precursors for Perylene Bisimides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Preparation of organic semiconductors by solution process is desirable to create flexible electronic devices.&#160;The use of soluble precursors, which exhibit high solubility in common organic solvents and afford the corresponding semiconducting molecules upon appropriate external stimuli such as heat and light, is a promising approach to realize this goal. Our group recently reported new soluble precursors, namely dinaphtho[1,8&#8208;bc:1',8'&#8208;ef]thiepine bisimide (DNTBI) and its sulfoxide, which afforded perylene bisimide, a representative n&#8208;type organic semiconductor, upon heating or light&#8208;irradiation. In this work, we report the second&#8208;generation synthetic route to DNTBI, which enabled gram&#8208;scale and diversity&#8208;oriented preparation of various&#160;N&#8208;substituted DNTBIs. We also disclosed the suitable combination of leaving group (S or SO), external stimulus (heat or light), and&#160;N&#8208;substituent to realize efficient charge transport.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclization Strategies Using Imide Derivatives for the Synthesis of Polycyclic Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main synthetic strategies to convert cyclic imides into polycyclic amine derivatives are revised. These synthetic routes have been classified according to their key features: N&#8208;acyliminium ions&#8208;based reactions, electrophilic activation of imides, use of strong nucleophiles, radicals&#8208;based methods, and miscellaneous strategies.







Abstract
Cyclization strategies employing imides and their derivatives have attracted the attention of several organic chemists interested in synthesizing polycyclic alkaloids. Numerous strategies have been developed, mostly focused on i) the use of masked iminium ions, ii) addition of weak nucleophiles onto the carbonyl group of the imide being activated by a Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acid, iii) addition of strong nucleophiles onto the imide carbonyl, iv) radical&#8208;based processes and v) miscellaneous methods. This review is not comprehensive. It aims to provide the reader with a selection of representative synthetic strategies available in the area up to date.

         <title>Reaching Room&#8208;Temperature Mesomorphism through Expansion of the Tristriazolotriazine Core with Alkoxybenzoate Units</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new and efficient form of derivatization of the TTT center is presented, where the self&#8208;assembly was enhanced upon the introduction of benzoate groups to the core, drastically lowering the transition temperatures and increasing the mesomorphism range.







Abstract
The tristriazolotriazine (TTT) N&#8208;heterocycle, despite being a relatively new mesogenic core for use in discotic liquid crystals, has already demonstrated its importance and promising characteristics. In this work, we extended the knowledge about the TTT, increasing the core size with alkoxybenzoate units, as well as evaluating how the expansion and number of peripheral chains affected the thermal and photophysical properties, both in solution and spin&#8208;coated films. Their thermal behaviour and self&#8208;assembly were studied by differential scanning calorimetry, polarizing optical microscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction with synchrotron radiation, while the photophysics was investigated by UV&#8208;Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. The results show that, despite a considerable decrease in the fluorescence quantum yield with the core expansion, the mesomorphic properties are significantly enhanced, with two products showing Colh mesophase at room temperature, with large range of mesomorphism and very good thermal stability. It was also demonstrated how structural changes affected the self&#8208;assembly properties.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Short proteoglycan fragments are of great importance for biochemical research. The solid&#8208;phase synthesis of such glycopeptides relies on excessive use of glycosylated amino acids, extended reaction times, and additional post&#8208;assembly deprotection protocols. We employed high&#8208;shear mixing for expedient and equimolar O&#8208;glycopeptide assembly. We further developed a stirring&#8208;based deprotection on the solid support, thus completing the synthesis of a glycopeptide library in a minimal amount of time and purification hurdles.</dc:description>

Studying critical reaction parameters (palladium precursors, solvents and bases) enabled the practical preparation of diverse &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated esters/amides under mild conditions (low Pd catalyst loading, phosphine&#8208;free, 2 bar CO, 60 &#176;C). The optimal catalytic system shows excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity for the activation of the allylic C&#8208;Cl bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>A Non&#8208;coded &#946;2,2&#8208;Amino Acid with Isoxazoline Core Able to Stabilize Peptides Folding Through an Unprecedented Hydrogen Bond</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New peptidomimetics containing a &#946;  2,2  &#8208;isoxazoline amino acid,&#160;  i.e.  &#160;5&#8208;(aminomethyl)&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydroisoxazole&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylic acid (Isox&#8208;&#946;  2,2  AA), were prepared and studied by NMR and theoretical calculation. Although similar amino acid derivatives have already been prepared&#160;  via&#160;  1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction, neither experimental details nor characterization were found and they were never used for peptide synthesis. Both enantiomers were inserted in peptide sequences to verify their ability to induce a secondary structure. We found that an unexpected conformation is given by&#160;  R  &#8208;Isox&#8208;&#946;  2,2  AA, inducing the folding of short peptides thanks to an unprecedented H&#8208;bond involving C=N of the isoxazoline side chain of our&#160; &#946;  2,2  &#8208;AA .</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Synthesis of Ynenamides through Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkynylation of Ynamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal catalysis is a useful tool for C&#8208;C bond&#8208;forming reactions. Of special interest is the hydroalkynylation reaction of alkynes, which provides a simple method for the synthesis of enamides representing interesting structural motifs in organic chemistry. So far, there are only a few examples of gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkynylation reactions. Herein, we were able to show by experiment that the gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkynylation of ynamides leads regio&#8208; and stereoselectively to the corresponding ynenamides, a rather unknown type of molecule. A wide range of products could be generated with yields up to 80% and, in contrast to many other gold&#8208;catalyzed alkyne dimerization reactions, alkyl groups are tolerated. Quantum chemical calculations and NMR labelling experiments reveal a mechanism via dual gold catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>New Insights into the Exploitation of BODIPY Derivatives as Organic Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron&#8208;dipyrromethene complexes (BODIPYs) are attracting a growing interest for their notable photophysical properties. Specifically, their application in organic photocatalysis is receiving particular attention thanks to their ability to undergo both electron and energy transfer processes, thus acting as promising photoredox catalysts and photosensitizers. Although the number of examples employing these organic dyes is constantly increasing, there are not so many studies that correlate their chemical composition to their photocatalytic activity. In this work, a rationally designed structure&#8208;activity relationship study was performed by selecting a synthetically relevant atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reaction as a benchmark. We demonstrated how the presence of heavy atoms in the chromophore&#8217;s core turned out to be essential for achieving high reactivity levels. On the contrary, electron&#8208;withdrawing groups in position 8 (meso) undermined the catalytic performances, in agreement with the proposed reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of a Bioactive Lignanamide Using a 5&#8208;endo&#8208;tet&#8208;type Cyclization of Activated Cyclopropylcarbinols and Synthetic Support for the Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first enantioselective total synthesis of a bioactive lignanamide was achieved with high enantiomeric excess. Key synthetic steps include an organocatalytic enantioselective cyclopropanation and a Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated chirality&#8208;transferring 5&#8208;  endo&#8208;tet  &#8208;type cyclization that proceeds with a very high degree of stereoinduction. The proposed mechanism of the key reaction is supported by the experimental results. &#160; Based on these &#160; experimental results, the&#160;  5&#8208;endo&#8208;tet  &#8208;type cyclization&#160;of a cyclopropylcarbinol proceeds predominantly via an S  N  1 mechanism with high&#160;  trans  &#8208;selectivity, which arises from the steric hindrance of the neighboring substituent. Minor pathways include the anchimeric participation&#160;of (i) the oxygen atom of the benzoyl group in an S  N  2 mechanism and/or (ii) a benzene&#8208;coordinated transition state in an S  N  1&#8208;like mechanism.</dc:description>

This work reports the concise chemical synthesis of the trisaccharide repeating unit of the O&#8208;antigen from Pseudomonas putida BIM B&#8208;1100 in the form of its aminoethyl glycoside through a linear strategy. The challenging aspects of this synthesis include the incorporation of the &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;GlcpNAc the &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;ManpNAcA residues. The desired carboxylic acid moiety has been achieved through late&#8208;stage TEMPO&#8208;mediated oxidation of the primary OH group.







Abstract
The manuscript reports the concise chemical synthesis of the trisaccharide repeating unit of the O&#8208;antigen from Pseudomonas putida BIM B&#8208;1100 in the form of its aminoethyl glycoside through a linear strategy with rational protecting group manipulations. The challenging aspects of this synthesis include the incorporation of the &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;ManpNAcA and the &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;GlcpNAc residues. The introduction of the desired carboxylic acid moiety has been achieved through late&#8208;stage TEMPO&#8208;mediated oxidation of the primary OH group on the protected trisaccharide. 1,2&#8208;cis aminoethyl glycoside with central glucosamine is used at the reducing end to the leave the scope for further glycoconjugate formation with suitable aglycone without hampering the anomeric stereochemistry.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;O Bond Formation by Directing Group Assisted C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic Csp2&#8722;H oxygenation is a challenging transformation in organic synthesis owing to its selectivity and efficiency. This Review highlights recent advances in the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;selective Csp2&#8722;H alkoxylation and acetoxylation of unactivated Csp2&#8211;H bonds using different types of directing groups.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed Csp2&#8722;H oxygenation is a synthetically invaluable transformation that enables the incorporation of synthetically useful functional groups, such as ethers and acetates, using a simple protocol. Compared to the well&#8208;developed palladium catalysis, the catalysis of cobalt, a 3d&#8208;transition metal, is recognized as a sustainable alternative for Csp2&#8722;H oxygenation because of the natural abundance of cobalt and cost&#8208;effectiveness of the catalyst. In this Review, recent advances in cobalt&#8208;catalyzed Csp2&#8722;H alkoxylation and acetoxylation are highlighted and several types of directing groups are discussed.

This Review highlights recent advances in the cobalt-catalyzed &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-selective C&lt;sub&gt;sp2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;H alkoxylation and acetoxylation of unactivated C&lt;sub&gt;sp2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;H bonds using different types of directing groups.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-catalyzed C&lt;sub&gt;sp2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;H oxygenation is a synthetically invaluable transformation that enables the incorporation of synthetically useful functional groups, such as ethers and acetates, using a simple protocol. Compared to the well-developed palladium catalysis, the catalysis of cobalt, a 3d-transition metal, is recognized as a sustainable alternative for C&lt;sub&gt;sp2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;H oxygenation because of the natural abundance of cobalt and cost-effectiveness of the catalyst. In this Review, recent advances in cobalt-catalyzed C&lt;sub&gt;sp2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;H alkoxylation and acetoxylation are highlighted and several types of directing groups are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improved Synthesis Strategy for N&#8208;Methoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazinane Nucleic Acids (MOANAs)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Condensation with 4&#8208;(benzoyloxy)benzaldehyde provides easy access to a protected phosphoramidite building block of (2R,3S)&#8208;4&#8208;(methoxyamino)butane&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triol, used as the backbone scaffold in the synthesis of N&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazinane nucleic acids (MOANAs). The resulting N&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2&#8208;[4&#8208;(benzoyloxy)phenyl]&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazinane moiety is stable under the conditions of oligonucleotide synthesis but readily hydrolyzed afterwards. Stability of the protection can be adjusted predictably by changing the substituent on the phenyl ring.







Abstract
Dependence of the hydrolysis rate of a series of N&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazinanes on the Hammett substituent constant of the substituent of the phenyl ring was determined, yielding a reaction constant &#961;=&#8722;1.40&#177;0.05. Based on this information, 4&#8208;(benzoyloxy)benzaldehyde was selected as a protecting group for a new (2R,3S)&#8208;4&#8208;(methoxyamino)butane&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triol phosphoramidite building block. The yield of the preparation of this building block as well as its coupling in automated oligonucleotide synthesis were greatly improved compared to the method reported previously. The 2&#8208;[4&#8208;(benzoyloxy)phenyl]&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazine protection persisted throughout the synthesis of short oligonucleotides but was rapidly removed when the oligonucleotides were released from solid support and dissolved in water.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lateral &#960;&#8208;extension of helicenes would yield interesting physical properties&#160;derived from the enhanced &#960;&#8208;stacking ability as well as intrinsic helical chirality. Here we report the regiodivergent synthesis of hexabenzocoronene (HBC)&#8208;based [6]helicenes via the cationic rhodium(I)/segphos complex&#8208;mediated intramolecular [2+2+2] and [2+1+2+1] cycloadditions of triynes followed by the Scholl reaction. The resulting HBC&#8208;based [6]helicenes possess stable helical chirality but more planar structure than previously reported HBC&#8208;based [7] and [9]helicenes. Therefore, these HBC&#8208;based [6]helicenes exhibit &#960;&#8208;stacking&#8208;induced chiral self&#8208;recognition in solution, allowing the measurement of enantiomeric ratios by&#160;1H NMR spectroscopy without any chiral additive.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Molecular iodine in combination with TBHP offers an advanced concept for organic synthesis and catalysis by improving the selectivity and sustainability of organic transformations. It leads to the development of metal free greener protocols under ambient conditions either as a catalytic duo or as a reagent system in combination with an additive. The advent of this indispensable tool led to formation of complex organic architectures empowering novel reaction pathways  via  C&#8211;H functionalization, cyclization, cycloaddition, rearrangement, sulfonylation/sulfenylation and oxidation reactions in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Acid&#8208;Stable Nucleobase Protection for a Strongly Pairing Pyridone C&#8208;Nucleoside Suitable for Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligonucleotides are indispensable tools in diagnostics, therapeutic applications and molecular biology. The low base pairing strength of thymine with adenine complicates their use. Ethynylpyridone  C  &#8208;nucleoside are analogs of thymidine that pair more strongly and with improved base selectivity, and sequences containing these analogs show improved target affinity and selectivity, but their routine use is hampered by diminished yields of solid&#8208;phase syntheses with the known building blocks. A partial loss of base protecting groups during the acidic deblocking step of chain extension cycles was identified as the cause of lower yields. Here we report the synthesis of an improved phosphoramidite building block featuring a pivaloyloxymethyl (POM) base protecting group. This building block gives oligonucleotides containing the strongly pairing ethynylmethylpyridone  C  &#8208;nucleoside in high yield and purity via solid phase synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Mannich Reaction: An Alternative Synthetic Approach for Various Pyrrole&#8208;Based Anion Receptors and Chelating Ligands</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review article highlights the synthetic design of various pyrrole&#8208;based acyclic, tripodal macrocyclic, and macrobicyclic Mannich bases and their applications, mainly as anion receptors. By varying the amine&#8208;types and molar proportions of reagents, a range of value&#8208;added Mannich bases are obtained. Herein, the synthesis and properties of several azacalixpyrroles, azacalixdipyrrolylmethanes, and azacryptands are discussed. Emphasis is also given to the applications of pyrrole&#8208;based Mannich bases in the construction of some chelating ligands as one of the steps in multistep organic syntheses. In addition, the use of Mannich products as ligands for synthesizing metal complexes is also described. More importantly, the establishment of Mannich reactions as an alternative approach for traditionally used Schiff&#8217;s base or aldehyde/ketone&#8208;condensation reactions is delineated.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Strategy towards a Carbocyclic N&#8208;Acetylneuraminic Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the study of glycosidases, a class of activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs), that are carbocyclic mimics of natural carbohydrates and can covalently bind the enzyme, have proven to be useful tools. This type of ABP has however not yet been reported for sialidases, glycosidases involved in various important biological processes in both health and disease, which hydrolyse terminal sialic acids. Here we present our study towards the synthesis of a carbocyclic sialic acid suitable for conversion into ABPs. We developed a route starting from a chiral furanone that includes a key early stage nitrone [3+2] cycloaddition to install most of the chiral centres present in N&#8208;acetylneuraminic acid. The final stereocentre is installed via a Barbier alkylation, after which a ring closing metathesis forms the pivotal carbocyclic intermediate. Due to challenges in the final stretch, we were not able to convert this intermediate into an N&#8208;acetylneuraminic acid ABP. However, the work presented here still represents a versatile route to potential future carbocyclic sialic acid derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Tools for the Temporal Control of Water Solution pH and Applications in Dissipative Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical reagents and methodologies (tools) employed for accurately and precisely programming over time the pH of a water solution are described in detail. For each tool, a number of selected examples is reported in order to show its feasibility and usefulness







Abstract
The chemical reagents used to achieve a predictable and programmable time control of the pH of water solutions are reviewed with the purpose to present a toolbox of instruments to be used when a precise pH vs time profile is needed.

     alt="Chemical Tools for the Temporal Control of Water Solution pH and Applications in Dissipative Systems"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chemical reagents and methodologies (tools) employed for accurately and precisely programming over time the pH of a water solution are described in detail. For each tool, a number of selected examples is reported in order to show its feasibility and usefulness
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chemical reagents used to achieve a predictable and programmable time control of the pH of water solutions are reviewed with the purpose to present a toolbox of instruments to be used when a precise pH vs time profile is needed. These tools are particularly useful in view of the growing interest on dissipative systems, many of which operate in water solutions, under the action of reagents (chemical fuels) that allow for programmed pH evolution. After a brief introduction describing the importance of such tools for the operation of dissipative systems in water, five sections follow, which illustrate the different method used so far to temporally control the pH of a water solution. In particular, time-programmable pH variations based on: 1) bubbling of gases (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Air), 2) hydrolysis of esters, lactones and sultones, 3) enzymatic and biocatalytic networks, 4) decarboxylation reaction of activated carboxylic acids, and 5) pH-oscillators are described together with selected examples of application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Metal&#8208;Free Chlorodifluoromethylation of Arenes and Heteroarenes by a Hypervalent Iodine EDA Complex</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light&#8208;mediated electron donor&#8211;acceptor complex enabling direct chlorodifluoromethylation of (hetero)arenes is described. This method provides the privileged moiety with mild conditions across a broad range of functional groups and bioactive scaffolds. Post&#8208;functionalization reactions and key control experiments are reported as well. The core EDA complex is studied spectroscopically, enabling further synthetic applications in the future.







Abstract
A novel EDA complex comprised of a bis(chlorodifluoroacetoxy)iodoarene and 1,3,5&#8208;trimethoxybenzene is described, which enables the direct radical C(sp2)&#8722;H chlorodifluoromethylation of arenes and heteroarenes under monochromatic visible&#8208;light irradiation. The procedure is mild, operationally simple, and utilizes commercially available reagents. The developed conditions demonstrate compatibility with a host of commonly encountered functionalities and biologically relevant scaffolds, whilst showcasing the post&#8208;functionalization capabilities of the &#8722;CF2Cl moiety. Various mechanistic studies were performed to explore the EDA complex and radical generation pathway.

         <title>Rapid and Mild Cleavage of Aryl&#8208;Alkyl Ethers to Liberate Phenols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report that the Piers&#8208;Rubinsztajn reaction enables rapid deprotection of aryl alkyl ethers under ambient conditions. This chemistry leverages tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane and silyl hydrides to convert aryl methyl ethers to siloxanes, which can then be cleaved using 1% HCl in EtOH. We examined 26 derivatives and routinely obtained yields &gt;85%, even in the presence of sterically demanding groups and complex substrate structures. Other alkyl ethers including ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, tert&#8208;butyl, and benzyl groups were also easily removed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Imidazoles constitute an important class of heterocyclic compounds with extensive potential use, from pharmaceuticals to optoelectronics. However, synthetic methodologies capable of producing novel nonsymmetric imidazoles are still scarce. In a combined synthesis, photophysical and computational investigation, we show that ruthenium(II) catalysis enables C&#8211;H/N&#8211;H alkyne annulation of nonsymmetric imidazoles derived from naturally occuring &#946;&#8208;lapachone and nor&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lapachone.

         <title>Biocatalytic Kinetic Resolution to Access Enantiomerically Enriched Dihydropyrimidinone/Thiones through Recognition of a Remote Stereocentre</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocatalytic and enantioselective methodology for the synthesis of dihydropyrimidinone/thiones was developed using lipase B from Candida antarctica. The results were promising even in cases in which the stereogenic centre was in remote positions from the reaction site (ee values up to 99&#8201;%). Molecular docking studies were performed to support the stereospecificity observed for the products formed.







Abstract
The Biginelli synthesis is a classic tricomponent reaction known to result in polyfunctionalized dihydropyrimidinone (DHPM) derivatives. Herein, we described a chemo&#8208;enzymatic strategy for obtaining enantiomerically enriched hydroxy&#8208;DHPMs. These compounds were previously esterified with butyric or acetic anhydride and were later submitted to hydrolysis reactions catalysed by lipase B from Candida antarctica. Although the stereogenic centre is far from the reaction site (4&#8211;5&#8197;bonds), moderate to excellent enantiomeric excess values were obtained (up to 99&#8201;%). Docking studies were performed in parallel to elucidate the binding modes of some molecules with the CALB active site, and were able to provide information on the enantiospecificity of these compounds in the hydrolysis reaction.

         <title>Mechanistic Aspects of the Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation in the Manufacture of Noradrenaline</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The only stereoselective process for the manufacture of noradrenaline known in the literature, an asymmetric transfer hydrogenation, was studied through a catalyst screening and expanded to hydrogenation conditions. The transition states geometries, when using the most stereoselective catalyst, are then evaluated through a computational study.







Abstract
Mechanistic, stereochemical and stereoelectronic aspects of the asymmetric reduction (via hydrogen or transfer hydrogenation) for the manufacture of N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;noradrenaline from the ketone precursor are studied through catalyst screening and computational evaluations. This reaction provides an efficient and industrially suitable method for the manufacture of enantiomerically pure noradrenaline, an important neurotransmitter which is widely used as a pharmacological substance due to its sympathomimetic properties.

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Analytical Evaluation of Fsp3&#8208;Inspired Raman Probes for Cellular Imaging</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fraction of sp  3&#160;&#8208;hybdrised carbons (Fsp  3  ) in drug candidates and other biologically relevant compounds has been proposed to be an important physicochemical consideration within medicinal chemistry. Currently available small&#8208;molecule probes for Raman imaging are not optimised for biological applications. We sought to improve upon the highly Raman&#8208;active, yet rigid, lipophilic, and aggregative, bisarylbutadiyne (BADY) motif by introducing Fsp  3  character. BADY analogues were designed, efficiently synthesised, and analysed by mass spectrometry &#8211; revealing a statistical correlation between compound aggregation and cLog  P  , but no correlation with sp  3  . However, X&#8208;ray crystallography demonstrated that the modifications to the BADY structure had a marked effect on crystal packing, suggesting Fsp  3  may still be important in reducing intermolecular stacking, and thus aggregation, of BADY. Cellular imaging by stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy allowed comparison of the intracellular distribution of the tags, guiding the design of future Raman probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Greener Synthesis of Pyrroloquinazoline Derivatives: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrroloquinazolines present a plethora of biological or pharmacological activities, thus attracting the interest of several research groups on the development of new and efficient synthetic strategies for obtaining this class of N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds. In this Review, the progress on the greener synthesis of pyrroloquinazoline derivatives achieved in the last decade is discussed.







Abstract
Quinazoline derivatives draw attention from a synthetic and medicinal chemistry point of view, given the wide range of biological activities already described. This class of fused N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds has also shown its importance and potential pharmacological application. This Review covers the contributions reported in the last ten years for the synthesis of pyrroloquinazoline derivatives, focusing on greener protocols to obtain these adducts, such as multicomponent reactions, photocatalysis, microwaves, electrosynthesis among others.

         <title>Asymmetric Dual&#8208;State Emitters Featuring Thiazole Acceptors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a new series of thiazole&#8208;based dual&#8208;state emission fluorophores with self&#8208;isolation properties in solution and good emission in the solid state are reported.







Abstract
This work describes a new approach to construct highly conjugated molecules with asymmetric donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8217; architectures (D&#8722;A&#8722;D&#8217;). Five new emissive compounds featuring thiazole, a scarcely used acceptor, were synthesized using a three&#8208;component Rh(II) catalytic reaction. The asymmetric fluorescent compounds show significant emission in solution (QY=73&#8201;%&#8211;100&#8201;%) and the solid&#8208;state (QY=14&#8201;%&#8211;59&#8201;%), and therefore considered Dual&#8208;State Emitters (DSE). We also evaluate the impact of O&#8208;alkyl chains with varying lengths in the photophysical properties in solution, aggregates, and solid&#8208;state. Computational studies indicate that the involved electronic transitions have a significant charge transfer character produced almost exclusively from the triphenylamine donors. According to the single crystal X&#8208;ray data of compounds 8 and 9, the conjugated structures have a twisted molecular conformation that contributes to the observed emission in the solid&#8208;state. These findings show a systematic approach to design DSE materials, which may help to stimulate their use in biological or optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Polycyclic Quinazolinones through C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization of Inert Alkanes or Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Oxidation Decarboxylation of N&#8208;Hydroxyphthalimide Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the cleavage of the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond of inert alkanes and the visible&#8208;light promoted oxidation decarboxylation of NHP&#8208;esters to form alkyl radicals, which then efficiently synthesize valuable polycyclic quinazolinones through radical addition and cyclization. Both methods were carried out in water or water/DMSO media without metal catalysts with good functional group compatibility.







Abstract
Two novel C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of inert alkanes and visible&#8208;light promoted oxidation decarboxylation of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHP) esters to access polycyclic quinazolinones have been described. These methods do not involve metal catalysts and are carried out in water or water/DMSO media. The wide substrate scope, even including the seven&#8208;membered ring under mild reaction conditions, demonstrate the practicability of these strategies.

         <title>Parallel Screening with 14C&#8208;Labeled Carbon Dioxide: De&#8208;risking the Staudinger&#8208;Aza&#8208;Wittig Reaction
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A de&#8208;risking approach was developed to evaluate the robustness of the Staudinger aza&#8208;Wittig sequence. This technology is based on [14C]CO2 screening that allowed to investigate the tolerance of the procedure with most representative heterocycles and functional groups found in FDA drugs.







Abstract
Carbon isotope labeling is a useful technology for tracking the fate of organic compounds in the environment and in living organisms. In this context, the development of robust and general methodologies amenable to the direct functionalization of CO2 remains a significant task. In this communication, a de&#8208;risking approach was developed to evaluate the robustness of the Staudinger aza&#8208;Wittig sequence for carbon isotope labeling. This technology is based on [14C]CO2 screening that allowed to investigate the tolerance of the procedure with most representative heterocycles and functional groups found in FDA approved drugs.

         <title>Regiodivergent Synthesis of Benzothiazole&#8208;Based Isosorbide Imidates by Oxidative N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regiodivergent synthesis of exo (2&#8208;OH) and endo (5&#8208;OH) isosorbide (IS) imidates containing biologically relevant N&#8208;heterocyclic rings (benzothiazole, benzoxazole, thiazole and isoxazole) has been achieved by oxidative N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis starting from aldimine starting materials. A large library of unprecedented high value&#8208;added products has been obtained with good levels of yield and regioselectivity.







Abstract
A novel N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;promoted regiodivergent protocol for exo (2&#8208;OH) and endo (5&#8208;OH) isosorbide (IS) imidates synthesis is described. The disclosed strategy allows the straightforward synthesis of monoimidate&#8208;isosorbides (MIIs) endowed with the biologically relevant benzothiazole (BTA) moiety under mild oxidative conditions, starting from easy&#8208;accessible aldimines. Process optimization encompassed the use of stoichiometric diquinone as well as atmospheric oxygen as oxidant species, focusing on reaction dichotomy between oxidative and oxygenative pathways. The reaction scope was investigated on a representative selection of BTA&#8208;containing aldimines and further extended to congeners bearing different biologically pivotal N&#8208;heterocyclic rings (benzoxazole, thiazole and isoxazole), observing good levels of yield (up to 87&#8201;%) and regioselectivity (exo/endo up to 10.0; endo/exo up to 7.0). Furthermore, the employment of an immobilized&#8208;NHC under heterogeneous conditions was assessed, showing satisfactory selectivity towards exo&#8208;MIIs (exo/endo=3.8). Overall, the methodology presented provided an unprecedented collection of high value&#8208;added products with potential applications in different fields.

A selective deconstructive strategy of indolo[2,3&#8208;a]quinolizines to hexahydroindolizin&#8208;3&#8208;ones under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions was developed and applied to the total synthesis of both enantiomers of cuscutamine. Additionally, controversy of the absolute configuration of the natural products was clarified.







Abstract
The general approach for accessing to a tetracyclic hexahydro&#8208;3H&#8208;indolizino[8,7&#8208;b]indol&#8208;3&#8208;one alkaloids is that what involves the construction of the &#947;&#8208;lactam ring from a tricyclic precursor. Here in this report, we disclose a new synthetic strategy that permits the direct deconstruction of the tetracyclic indolo[2,3&#8208;a]quinolizine motif into the tetracyclic hexahydroindolizin&#8208;3&#8208;one scaffold of the naturally occurring (+)&#8208;cuscutamine without the use of either transition or precious metals. Additionally, the current total synthesis of both enantiomers provides structural clarification of the natural occurring alkaloid.

         <title>Molecular Iodine&#8208;Catalysed Reductive Alkylation of Indoles: Late&#8208;Stage Diversification for Bioactive Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular iodine&#8208;catalysed efficient synthesis of C3&#8208;alkylated indoles was well established, which exhibits excellent functional group tolerance, mild conditions, and wide substrate scope. Notably, this environmental&#8208;friendly methodology also finds application in the late&#8208;stage modification of drug&#8208;like molecules.







Abstract
Herein, we report a molecular iodine&#8208;catalysed reductive alkylation of indoles with carbonyl compounds using Et3SiH for the efficient synthesis of C3&#8208;alkylated indoles. This metal&#8208;free and environmental&#8208;friendly process exhibits excellent functional group tolerance, mild conditions, and wide substrate scope. Notably, the synthetic usefulness of this strategy to pharmacochemistry was highlighted by the late&#8208;stage modification of drug&#8208;like molecules.

         <title>On the Mechanism of Halogen Atom Transfer from C&#8722;X Bonds to &#945;&#8208;Aminoalkyl Radicals: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive computational study of the Halogen Atom Transfer (XAT) mechanism is reported. Up to 32 &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical/organic halide combinations are explored to understand the effect of the C&#8722;X bond, the influence of &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical properties and the alkyl or aryl character of the reactive C center in the reactivity.







Abstract
Generation of carbon centered radicals from organic halides represents a powerful tool in modern organic chemistry, especially in the context of photoredox catalysis. However, activation of carbon&#8211;halogen bonds is usually promoted by toxic and hazardous tin reagents. Alternatively, &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals have emerged as a cheap and efficient halogen atom transfer (XAT) reagents, although the activation mechanism is still underexplored with respect to hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) chemistry. Herein, we report a computational systematic evaluation of four different &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals on the Halogen Atom Transfer (XAT) mechanism. We have evaluated up to 32&#8197;reactions, including two different types of substrates (Ph&#8722;X and Cy&#8722;X). This systematic study aims to provide a big picture on the key effects in this reactivity including the hybridization of carbon, the nature of the halogen, and the electronics/sterics of the &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical.

         <title>Synthetic Applications of Photocatalyzed Halogen&#8208;Radical Mediated Hydrogen Atom Transfer for C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalysis is a method of choice for the generation of reactive intermediates under mild conditions. This Review collects the recent examples exploiting this manifold to generate highly aggressive halogen radicals to activate C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds via Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) for synthetic purposes. Available strategies to influence site&#8208;selectivity of the hydrogen atom transfer step have also been discussed.







Abstract
The opportunity to activate C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds via homolytic cleavage by means of halogen radicals has long been disregarded in synthetic endeavors due to the unpredictable selectivity. Nowadays, photocatalysis has established itself as a method of choice for the generation of such reactive intermediates under mild conditions. This Minireview collects recent examples showcasing how photocatalytic manifolds have been used to tame aggressive halogen radicals to activate C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds via Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) for synthetic purposes. In the last section of this work, we address site&#8208;selectivity issues posed by this methodology and show how it can be guided through the judicious choice of reaction conditions.

         <title>Robust Synthesis of Tetra&#8208;Boronate Esters Analogues and the Corresponding Boronic Acids Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and robust synthetic strategy that could build a series of tetra&#8208;boronate analogues in gram&#8208;scale is reported. Further, a universal deprotection condition that allows the direct transformation of tetra&#8208;boronates to their corresponding boronic acids is also included in this study.







Abstract
Organoboron compounds are widely used in catalytic reactions, medicinal chemistry, chemosensors, and polymer applications, because of their low toxicity, high stability, Lewis acidity, chemical versatility, and ability to form covalent bonds with their nucleophilic targets, In this report, we demonstrate how to efficiently assemble tetra boronate&#8208;containing compounds at the gram&#8208;scale via a one&#8208;pot modified microwave&#8208;assisted Ugi&#8208;4CR reaction. These boronate esters can then be transformed into the corresponding boronic acids under a reliable deprotection method, also reported herein.

         <title>Z&#8208;Selective Alkene Formation from Reductive Aldehyde Homo&#8208;Couplings</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presence of an electron&#8208;withdrawing group at the PIII of a phosphanyl phosphonate reagent MesFP(H)P(O)(OEt)2 (see Figure) renders the reductive aldehyde coupling of aldehydes selectively for the thermodynamically less stable Z&#8208;olefin product.







Abstract
Current methodologies for the direct reductive coupling of two aldehydes to alkenes afford almost exclusively the thermodynamically favoured E&#8208;isomer. Recent efforts to find phosphorus&#8208;based reagents as replacements for the low&#8208;valent Ti species in McMurry couplings present opportunities to change this shortcoming, and to design new reagents that allow for the formation of high proportions of Z&#8208;alkenes under kinetic control. Here, we report the first example of such a reagent, a phosphanyl phosphonate MesFP(H)P(O)(OEt)2, 6, with an electron&#8208;deficient MesF=2,4,6&#8208;(CF3)3Ph substituent that promotes the reductive homo&#8208;coupling of (hetero)aromatic aldehydes to alkenes with high Z&#8208;selectivity. Computational results indicate that the selectivity stems from the electron deficient MesF, which results in lowered activation barriers for the collapse of a cis&#8208;oxaphosphetane intermediate. In the absence of MesF, the E&#8208;isomer is exclusively observed experimentally. Directing the isomeric outcome of alkene formation by introducing electron withdrawing P&#8208;substituents bears resemblance to the Still&#8208;Gennari modification of the Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons reaction where perfluorinated ethoxy substituents in the former also lead to high proportions of the Z&#8208;isomer.

         <title>Bromide Oxidation: A Safe Strategy for Electrophilic Brominations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, an overview is given of chemical oxidants for the radical/electrophilic brominations starting from harmless bromide sources as an alternative for toxic molecular bromine. The characteristics of the active brominating species as well as plausible side reactions have been discussed.







Abstract
Bromination of organic substances is still an important reaction in modern synthetic chemistry. In view of the increasing demand for sustainable synthetic chemistry, oxidative bromination can play an important role to avoid the use of hazardous molecular bromine (Br2). In this review, a complete overview of the chemical oxidants will be provided which have been used for the electrophilic as well as radical brominations, starting from less hazardous bromide Br(&#8722;I); e.&#8201;g., HBr or a bromide salt, with a focus on the differences caused by the choice of oxidant.

         <title>Mechanistic Studies on the Epoxidation of Alkenes by Macrocyclic Manganese Porphyrin Catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion mobility mass spectrometry reveals that a manganese (III) porphyrin cage reacts with the oxidant iodosylbenzene to form an inside iodosylbenzene complex, which is converted into a manganese(V)oxo complex in which the oxo group is located inside the cage (left). It reacts within the cage with alkenes to form epoxides. When the cage is blocked by methyl groups the reaction with iodosylbenzene and the formation of the manganese(V)oxo complex occurs at the outside of the cage (right). Subsequent reaction with alkenes takes place at the outside.







Abstract
Macrocyclic metal porphyrin complexes can act as shape&#8208;selective catalysts mimicking the action of enzymes. To achieve enzyme&#8208;like reactivity, a mechanistic understanding of the reaction at the molecular level is needed. We report a mechanistic study of alkene epoxidation by the oxidant iodosylbenzene, mediated by an achiral and a chiral manganese(V)oxo porphyrin cage complex. Both complexes convert a great variety of alkenes into epoxides in yields varying between 20&#8211;88&#8201;%. We monitored the process of the formation of the manganese(V)oxo complexes by oxygen transfer from iodosylbenzene to manganese(III) complexes and their reactivity by ion mobility mass spectrometry. The results show that in the case of the achiral cage complex the initial iodosylbenzene adduct is formed on the inside of the cage and in the case of the chiral one on the outside of the cage. Its decomposition leads to a manganese complex with the oxo ligand on either the inside or outside of the cage. These experimental results are confirmed by DFT calculations. The oxo ligand on the outside of the cage reacts faster with a substrate molecule than the oxo ligand on the inside. The results indicate how the catalytic activity of the macrocyclic porphyrin complex can be tuned and explain why the chiral porphyrin complex does not catalyze the enantioselective epoxidation of alkenes.

         <title>Synthesis of 1,5&#8208;Disubstituted Tetrazole&#8722;Indolizine Bis&#8208;Heterocycles and Their Copper (II) Recognizing Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double one&#8208;pot process was used for the synthesis of a bis&#8208;heterocyclic system encompassing 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;3H&#8208;pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]indolizin&#8208;3&#8208;one and 1,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole moieties. These reactions proceeded under mild reaction conditions and were operationally simple. The photophysical properties of the synthetized bis&#8208;heterocycles were evaluated against copper (II) addition.







Abstract
A novel bis&#8208;heterocyclic system encompassing the 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;3H&#8208;pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]indolizin&#8208;3&#8208;one and 1,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole moieties was designed, synthesized, and evaluated as a Copper (II) recognizing agent. This was achieved by exploiting the optical characteristics of indolizine and the copper recognizing activity of tetrazoles. For the preparation of these compounds, a novel and simple synthetic strategy consisting in a double one&#8208;pot process involving four&#8208;step reactions was developed. The first process is a one&#8208;pot five component reaction by using propargylamine as a bifunctional reactant to access the key intermediate, the N&#8208;acylated tetrazole. Consequently, N&#8208;acylated tetrazole was subjected to a one&#8208;pot three component reaction, consisting in a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution followed of a domino process to afford the target compounds. The photophysical properties of the obtained bis&#8208;heterocycles were evaluated against copper (II) addition.

         <title>Precision Glycodendrimers for DC&#8208;SIGN Targeting
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent antagonists able to reach the four carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD) of DC&#8208;SIGN have been prepared. The extended rigid core of these glycodendrimers allows multivalent presentation of glycomimetic molecules in a spatially defined fashion, providing high affinity towards DC&#8208;SIGN and selectivity over other C&#8208;type lectins featuring distinct CRD arrangements. The constructs successfully inhibit DC&#8208;SIGN binding to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein and DC&#8208;SIGN mediated trans&#8208;infection by Ebola virus.







Abstract
Multivalent ligands of the C&#8208;type lectin receptor DC&#8208;SIGN have emerged as effective antiadhesive agents against various pathogens. Some years ago, we described a hexavalent DC&#8208;SIGN ligand, Polyman&#8208;26, designed to bridge two of the four binding sites displayed by the receptor. In this work, we present our efforts to accomplish simultaneous coordination of all four carbohydrate binding sites of DC&#8208;SIGN through the synthesis of cross&#8208;shaped glycodendrimers. The tailored rigid scaffold allowed multivalent presentation of glycomimetics in a spatially defined fashion, while providing good water solubility to the constructs. Evaluation of the biological activity by SPR assays revealed strong binding avidity towards DC&#8208;SIGN and increased selectivity over langerin. Inhibition of DC&#8208;SIGN binding to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein and of DC&#8208;SIGN mediated Ebola virus trans&#8208;infection testifies for the glycodendrimers potential application in infection diseases. The tetravalent platform described here is easily accessible and can be used in modular fashion with different ligands, thus lending itself to multiple applications.

Room temperature, Liquid assisted grinding was used for the synthesis 5&#8208;aryl/spiro&#8208;[1,2,4]&#8208;triazolidine&#8208;3&#8208;thiones. This protocol is a catalyst&#8208;free and atom economic process bearing wide substrate scope and the isolation of products is chromatography free. It shows an efficient application of mechanochemical synthesis and also exemplifies green chemistry.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;dimethylbarbituric acid&#8208;H2O mediated liquid assisted mechanochemical route has been developed for the synthesis of a wide array of 5&#8208;aryl/spiro&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolidine&#8208;3&#8208;thiones, via in&#8197;situ generation of benzylidene/alkylidene barbiturates, followed by tandem, base&#8208;driven Michael addition reaction and rearrangement of the pyrimido[4,5&#8208;e][1,2,4]triazepine intermediate. The method is an application of mechanochemistry in organic synthesis. It is efficient, easy to follow and avoids the tedious steps of catalyst preparation and chromatographic separation. Moreover, the protocol is compared to &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221;, room temperature approach and the reaction mechanism has been revisited with the aid of experiments.

         <title>Versatility of the Amino Group in Hydrazone&#8208;based Molecular and Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrazones are common building blocks of supramolecular entities because they can undergo conformational, configurational, and/or constitutional changes in response to an external stimulus. This Review explores the important role of the N&#8722;H group of the hydrazone framework in these different dynamics in molecular and supramolecular systems published in the last decades. Some synthetic methodologies to obtain them are also described.







Abstract
Hydrazone&#8208;based systems have been, and continue to be, widely studied in the field of supramolecular chemistry due to the chemical versatility of their triatomic C=N&#8208;N structure, whose amino nitrogen commonly bears a methyl group or a hydrogen atom. Herein we review the conformational, configurational, and constitutional dynamics of these systems, focusing on the particularly important role of the N&#8722;H group of the hydrazone framework in each of those processes observed in molecular and supramolecular systems published in recent decades. Due to the enormous diversity of supramolecular architectures and molecular entities, the most representative synthetic methodologies to obtain them are described.

         <title>Exploring Glycan Binding Specificity of Odorranalectin by Alanine Scanning Library</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of amino acids in odorranalectin sequence, a cyclic peptide with lectin&#8208;like properties, for the glycan binding was evaluated by alanine scanning approach. Results revealed residues crucial for binding L&#8208;fucose, D&#8208;galactose and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;galactosamine (Lys5, Phe7, Tyr9, Gly12, Leu14, and Thr17), carbohydrate binding specificity (Phe7 and Arg8), and improved affinity compared to the native odorranalectin (Ser3, Pro4, and Val13).







Abstract
Fluorescently labelled alanine scan analogues of odorranalectin (OL), a cyclic peptide that exhibits lectin like properties, were screened for binding BSA&#8208;conjugated monosaccharides using an enzyme&#8208;linked lectin assay (ELLA). Results revealed that Lys5, Phe7, Tyr9, Gly12, Leu14, and Thr17 were crucial for binding BSA&#8208;L&#8208;fucose, BSA&#8208;D&#8208;galactose and BSA&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;galactosamine. Notably, Ala substitution of Ser3, Pro4, and Val13 resulted in higher binding affinities compared to the native OL. The obtained data also indicated that Arg8 plays an important role in differentiation of binding for BSA&#8208;L&#8208;fucose/D&#8208;galactose from BSA&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;galactosamine. The thermodynamics of binding of the selected alanine analogues was evaluated by isothermal titration calorimetry. Low to moderate binding affinities were determined for the tetravalent MUC1 glycopeptide and asialofetuin, respectively, and high for the fucose rich polysaccharide, fucoidan. The thermodynamic profile of interactions with asialofetuin exhibits shift to an entropy&#8208;driven mechanism compared to the fucoidan, which displayed an enthalpy&#8208;entropy compensation, typically associated with the carbohydrate&#8208;lectin recognition process.

         <title>Diastereoselective Functionalization of Chiral N&#8208;Acyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazolidines and Their Applications in the Synthesis of Bioactive Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,3&#8208;Oxazoldine chiral auxiliaries are a valuable tool for asymmetric synthesis, often leading to the exploration of new chemistry, due to their ease of synthesis and functionalization. This Review summarizes the advances in the field, with a focus on the synthesis of bioactive molecules.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Oxazolidines, derived from widely available enantiomerically pure 1,2&#8208;aminoalcohols, are versatile chiral auxiliaries for several key transformations, often serving as a platform for inquiries into new and complex reactivity. This Review focuses on the chemistry of N&#8208;acyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazolidines in which the stereoselective transformation is carried out on the N&#8208;acyl attached side chain of the molecule, covering reports from late 1980s to 2020 across several fields of asymmetric synthesis of bioactive molecules, and in particular of natural products.

         <title>A Photoredox Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama Reaction Catalytic in Chromium</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Allylation of aldehydes is possible by a real photoredox Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama reaction starting from available allyl halides and stable Cr(III) salts.







Abstract
Organochromium(III) species are multipurpose nucleophiles used in the synthesis of complex organic molecules due to their high functional group tolerance and extraordinary chemoselectivity for aldehydes. The preparation of organochromium(III) species starting from organic halides requires the use of a stoichiometric amount of chromium(II) salts or a catalytic amount of chromium(III) salts in the presence of stoichiometric reductants (such as Mn(0)). Recently, radicals formation from readily available alkenes, followed by their trapping with stoichiometric or catalytic amount of chromium(II) salts were reported in photoredox conditions for the generation of Cr(III) organometallic species. In this paper we disclose a real Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama reaction (NH) in which photoredox conditions enable the preparation of Cr(III) allyl reagents starting from available allyl halides and stable Cr(III) salts.

         <title>Exporting Homogeneous Transition Metal Catalysts to Biological Habitats</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed reactions are being increasingly used in biological contexts and even in living cells and organisms. Most of the processes so far developed rely on the ability of metal complexes to bind and activate unsaturated systems in a bioorthogonal way. The reactions are often tracked by fluorescence microscopy, by using reaction probes that emit light only after the reaction.







Abstract
The possibility of performing designed transition&#8208;metal catalyzed reactions in biological and living contexts can open unprecedented opportunities to interrogate and interfere with biology. However, the task is far from obvious, in part because of the presumed incompatibly between organometallic chemistry and complex aqueous environments. Nonetheless, in the past decade there has been a steady progress in this research area, and several transition&#8208;metal (TM)&#8208;catalyzed bioorthogonal and biocompatible reactions have been developed. These reactions encompass a wide range of mechanistic profiles, which are very different from those used by natural metalloenzymes. Herein we present a summary of the latest progress in the field of TM&#8208;catalyzed bioorthogonal reactions, with a special focus on those triggered by activation of multiple carbon&#8208;carbon bonds.

         <title>Pro&#8208;Pro Dipeptide&#8208;Thiourea Organocatalyst in the Mannich Reaction between &#945;&#8208;Imino Esters and Pyruvates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional peptide&#8208;thiourea organocatalysts enantioselectively catalyze Mannich reaction between tosyl&#8208;protected glyoxylate imine and pyruvate esters. N&#8208;terminal proline moiety is responsible for the stereoinduction of this reaction. DFT calculations, NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry confirm bifunctional nature of the catalyst and simultaneous activation of both substrates.







Abstract
Enantioselective catalytic formation of polyfunctional molecules, such as non&#8208;natural amino acids, is important for the efficient production of many chiral compounds. To this end, we present here the synthesis and evaluation of the catalytic activity of bifunctional peptide&#8211;thiourea organocatalysts. These hybrid organocatalysts consist of Pro&#8208;Pro dipeptide and thiourea moiety connected via a 1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane unit. These catalysts promoted challenging Mannich reaction between &#945;&#8208;imino esters and pyruvates, providing orthogonally protected oxo&#8208;glutamate derivatives. The N&#8208;tosyl&#8208;protected imino ester, as the most active imine, was required to compensate for the poor reactivity of pyruvates. DFT calculations, NMR, and CD spectroscopy help elucidate the mode of action of these catalysts. Configuration of the dipeptide Pro&#8208;Pro moiety is responsible for the sense of the stereoinduction of the Mannich reaction.

         <title>Solvent Screening Is Not Solvent Effect: A Review on the Most Neglected Aspect of Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent effect, the most neglected aspect in the study of multicomponent reactions (MCRs) has been reviewed. The essential role of solvent effects and the influence over MCRs are described and critically discussed in this Perspective.







Abstract
In the current Perspective article, we critically review and discuss the importance of solvent effects on multicomponent reactions, likely the most neglected aspect in this research field. Although solvent&#8208;free reactions may be desirable sometimes, most multicomponent reactions still require a solvent to properly promote them. This requirement makes the knowledge of all drawbacks and advantages of each solvent a central issue when trying to optimize multicomponent reactions. Yet, only a few studies with actual evidence of solvent effects on these key reactions have been published. For the quantitative effects of solvents, studies are even scarcer. In this Perspective, we argue that greater efforts should be directed to such fundamental studies.

         <title>Cooperative Tertiary Phosphine/Palladium Catalyzed Nucleophilic Allylation between Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Carbonates and Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nucleophilic allylation reaction between isatin&#8208;derived Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates and simple alkenes was developed via cooperative tertiary phosphine and palladium catalysis. The in&#8197;situ generated onium salts and &#951;1&#8208;allylpalladium species were finely assembled with exclusive linear selectivity, producing a spectrum of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
In this work, we report an unusual nucleophilic allylation reaction between isatin&#8208;derived Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates and simple alkenes synergistically catalyzed by tertiary phosphines and palladium complexes, through chemoselective assemblies of in&#8197;situ formed onium salts and &#951;1&#8208;allylpalladium species, respectively. A range of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles were easily constructed in moderate to good yields with exclusive linear regioselectivity. Moreover, a number of control and deuterium experiments have been conducted to elucidate the catalytic mechanism.

         <title>Efficient Asymmetric Synthesis of an A&#8208;Ring Synthon for Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Preparation of 1&#945;&#8208;Hydroxyvitamin D Metabolites and Analogs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient Lewis acid&#8208;assisted asymmetric carbonyl&#8208;ene reaction to set the 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxyl functionality of enol&#8208;triflate, precursor of the A&#8208;ring of the hormone calcitriol and its 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxyderivatives, is described.







Abstract
The secondary parallel hypercalcemic effects associated with the treatment of several hyperproliferative diseases with the natural hormone 1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) and/or known active vitamin D metabolites and analogs, demand the development of efficient and rapid methods for the preparation of vitamin D receptor (VDR) ligands as new selective and non&#8208;calcemic agonists. Here we describe an efficient and adaptable multigram&#8208;scale synthetic sequence to access an A&#8208;ring synthon as useful precursor of the vitamin D triene system of 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxylated vitamin D derivatives via Pd&#8208;catalyzed carbocyclization/Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions in a protic medium.

&lt;p&gt;An efficient Lewis acid-assisted asymmetric carbonyl-ene reaction to set the 1&#945;-hydroxyl functionality of enol-triflate, precursor of the A-ring of the hormone calcitriol and its 1&#945;-hydroxyderivatives, is described.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secondary parallel hypercalcemic effects associated with the treatment of several hyperproliferative diseases with the natural hormone 1&#945;,25-dihydroxyvitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (calcitriol) and/or known active vitamin D metabolites and analogs, demand the development of efficient and rapid methods for the preparation of vitamin D receptor (VDR) ligands as new selective and non-calcemic agonists. Here we describe an efficient and adaptable multigram-scale synthetic sequence to access an A-ring synthon as useful precursor of the vitamin D triene system of 1&#945;-hydroxylated vitamin D derivatives via Pd-catalyzed carbocyclization/Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross-coupling reactions in a protic medium. The key step is an asymmetric Lewis acid-promoted carbonyl-ene reaction to a chiral glyosylate ester to establish the 1&#945;-hydroxyl group of 1&#945;,25-dihydroxyvitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and its derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Remote Functionalization of 8&#8208;Substituted Quinolines with para&#8208;Quinone Methides: Access to Unsymmetrical Tri(hetero)arylmethanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An expedient method for the preparation of unsymmetrical tri(hetero)arylmethanes from para&#8208;quinone methides and derivatives of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline under copper catalysis is described.







Abstract
A C(5)&#8722;H remote functionalization of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline derivatives with para&#8208;quinone methides, affording direct access to unsymmetrical tri(hetero)arylmethanes in 69&#8211;96&#8201;% yield is described. This method provides diverse tri(hetero)arylmethanes with a broad scope and in a regioselective manner. The transformation works well with electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient substrates.

         <title>Directed Crosslinking of RNA by Glutathione&#8208;Triggered PNA&#8208;Quinone&#8208;Methide&#8208;Conjugates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PNA conjugates of redox&#8208;labile quinone methide precursors can be activated by glutathione at concentrations typical for the cytosol. The quinone methide, an electrophilic short&#8208;lived intermediate, then reacts with nucleophiles. When the PNA part is hybridized with a complementary strand of RNA, directed alkylation of the nucleobases can form crosslinks in yields up to 71&#8201;%.







Abstract
Quinone methide precursors protected with alkyldithiomethyl groups have been synthesized and converted into PNA conjugates. Stable in the absence of reducing agents, the electrophilic quinone methide is released by glutathione in concentrations typical for the cytosol. Self&#8208;alkylation then occurs or crosslinking of RNA when hybridized with complementary strands. Fastest reactions are seen for the sterically least hindered compound.

         <title>Ecological and Economic Efforts in the Development of Molecular Sensors for the Optical Detection of Cyanide Ions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review summarizes recent advances in optical molecular probes used to detect cyanide ions based on five representative families of probes containing triphenylamine, BODIPY, coumarin, pyrene, and pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidine. In particular, the analysis focuses on the sustainable synthesis of compounds considering some environmental and economic factors.







Abstract
Cyanide anions have wide use in industrial areas despite their high toxicity to the environment as waste; thus, numerous studies on the determination of this anion have been carried out. This review discusses recent progress in the colorimetric and fluorimetric detection of cyanide by nucleophilic addition or acid&#8211;base reactions to different types of receptors by the chemodosimeter approach. Beyond sensor performance, we focus our analysis on the sustainable synthesis features of five representative families of probes based on small molecules. Some environmental and economic factors are considered (reaction mass efficiency, number of chemical changes, solvent greenness average, preliminary raw material cost, and energy implications), giving a complete picture of the current status of research in this detection field.

         <title>Quinazoline&#8208;Assisted ortho&#8208;Halogenation with N&#8208;Halosuccinimides through Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed halogenation of 2&#8208;phenylquinazolines using N&#8208;halosuccinimides as halogen sources was described via C&#8722;H activation under mild reaction conditions. A series of halogen&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;arylquinazolines were synthesized through C&#8722;H functionalization.







Abstract
An efficient quinazoline&#8208;assisted ortho&#8208;halogenation of 2&#8208;arylquinazolines has been developed using N&#8208;halosuccinimides as halogen sources with Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation. No additional ligand and oxidant are required. This protocol is highly regioselective and applicable to a broad range of quinazoline substrates bearing different functional groups, giving yields of up to 98&#8201;%. The mechanism of the quinazoline ortho&#8208;halogenation was investigated by comprehensive experimentation.

         <title>Fast Heating&#8208;Assisted One&#8208;Pot Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Sulfonylation and Sulfochlorination of Styrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a one&#8208;pot copper&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation and sulfochlorination of styrenes under fast heating conditions. Optimization, substrate scope, and detailed procedures are discussed. The reactions showed moderate to excellent yields and appear as an interesting fast and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle alternative to obtain &#946;&#8208;chloro&#8208; or vinylsulfones.







Abstract
Here, a strategy for the synthesis under fast&#8208;heating conditions of vinyl sulfones and &#946;&#8208;chlorosulfones from styrene derivatives, tosyl chloride (TsCl) as sulfonyl and chlorine source, and CuBr&#8208;neocuproine as the catalytic system is reported. The reaction occurs through&#160;an atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) mechanism to generate the sulfochlorinated adducts followed by E2 elimination to generate the vinyl sulfones. This methodology allows a wide range of vinyl sulfones and &#946;&#8208;chlorosulfones to be obtained using inexpensive reagents in one and five minutes respectively. These reactions appear as an interesting fast and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle alternative to obtain these compounds.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stereoselective Synthesis of 6,7&#8208;Dideoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranuronates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of the rare and challenging &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranuronate configuration can be succeeded using a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective one&#8208;pot process from a 2&#8208;O&#8208;activated &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;galacto&#8208;octopyranuronate ester. The &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranosyl ring was revealed to adopt predominantly a 4C1 chair conformation by NMR.







Abstract
6&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosides are challenging glycosides to synthesize due to their unusual 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;heptose backbone, rare ido&#8208;configuration and most importantly, the &#946;&#8208;1,2&#8208;cis anomeric linkage. They are found in nature, such as being part of the repeating disaccharide of C. jejuni HS:4 capsular polysaccharides (CPs). Interestingly, the bacterial CPs is found to be partially modified with an O&#8208;methyl phosphoramidate (MeOPN) functionality at the O&#8208;2 or O&#8208;7 position of the 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosides. In this work, we report the first synthesis of three analogous of &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranosides (1&#8211;3) that contain a 6,7&#8208;dideoxy&#8208;functionality and either a terminal methyl ester or carboxylic acid or amide. Since carboxylic acids have been reported as bioisosteres of phosphate group, compound 1&#8211;3 can be regarded as carbon&#8208;based bioisosteres of 6&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranoside containing the MeOPN group without a chiral center. Compounds (1&#8211;3) were efficiently synthesized from a O&#8208;2 activated &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;galacto&#8208;octopyranuronate (19) that was efficiently converted to the desired &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranuronate configuration using an elegant one&#8208;pot process.

         <title>Dual Photocatalysis for the Straightforward Coupling of Thiosugars and Arylsulfoximines: Towards Unprecedented Cyclic Heteroatomic Structures</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple protocol towards thioglycosylated S&#8208;aryl S&#8208;perfluoroalkyl sulfoximines was developed. This coupling reaction between a series of glycosyl thiols and various ortho&#8208;functionalized S&#8208;aryl S&#8208;perfluoroalkyl sulfoximines employs the dual photoredox catalysts [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2/Ni(II) irradiated with visible light. In addition, an unpreceded cyclization of the S&#8208;trifluoromethyl substrates was discovered that furnishes original benzodithiazole and oxobenzodithiazole heterocycles.







Abstract
A general, scalable and easy to implement protocol is described for the coupling of thiosugars and various ortho&#8208;functionalized S&#8208;aryl S&#8208;perfluoroalkyl sulfoximines. This dual photocatalysis methodology was developed with a commercial hydrogen atom transfer reagent and produced key structures that were transformed into original cyclic skeletons bearing previously undescribed chemical functions.

         <title>The Chemistry of Cyclopropanes and New Insights into Organocatalyzed Asymmetric Cyclopropanation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main reactions carried out on cyclopropanes to transform them into several useful structures are presented in this Review. In addition, the main cyclopropanation methods are reviewed. Finally, different asymmetric organocatalytic syntheses of the last two decades until 2021 are presented.







Abstract
Cyclopropane structure has been the object of interest in multiple investigations due to its prevalence in different natural products. In addition, this structure has a particular reactivity, specifically the 1,1&#8208;cyclopropanedicarboxylate compounds, which act as acceptor&#8208;donor cyclopropanes. Its reactivity could be compared with that of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl, which undergoes conjugate addition reaction and depending on the nature of the nucleophile this can lead to a cycloaddition reaction. Therefore, cyclopropane can be transformed into several useful structures in organic synthesis. Different methods have been described to achieve cyclopropanes such as, Simmons&#8208;Smith reaction, decomposition of diazoalkanes and Michael&#8208;Initiated ring closure (MIRC). Due to the absence of metals, this last method has been applied to the asymmetric organocatalytic synthesis of cyclopropanes, where the substrates activation is through the imine&#8208;enamine intermediates formation or by hydrogen bonds. The asymmetric reaction consists of a domino reaction composed of a conjugate addition reaction and a cyclization reaction via intramolecular nucleophilic substitution. In this review, different asymmetric organocatalytic syntheses of the last two decades until 2021 are presented. With the intention to facilitate the reading of the review, an example of each paper was selected with the optimal reaction conditions and with the best organocatalyst producing the best yield and high stereoselectivity.

         <title>Synthesis of Rigid Macrocyclic Phenols and Their Catalytic Applications in Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic catalysts having a phenol&#8208;acetylene&#8208;phenol triad were developed. The rigid macrocyclic framework enabled the triads to form efficient hydrogen&#8208;bonds with carbonyl groups of substrates. The catalysts accelerated Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, and the catalytic abilities were higher than that of an acyclic counterpart.







Abstract
Macrocyclic catalysts having a phenol&#8208;acetylene&#8208;phenol triad were developed as a hydrogen&#8208;bond donor catalyst. The rigid macrocyclic framework suppressed intramolecular hydrogen bonds between neighboring phenolic hydroxy groups. The preorganized phenol&#8208;acetylene&#8208;phenol moiety formed efficient intermolecular hydrogen bonds with carbonyl groups of substrates. The hydrogen&#8208;bond donor catalysts accelerated the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of methyl vinyl ketone with cyclopentadiene. The catalytic ability was higher than that of an acyclic counterpart.

Three&#8208;component Heck&#8208;Knoevenagel synthesis optimized by statistical design of experiments and Bayesian optimization gives phenothiazinyl merocyanines with an efficiency of 93&#8201;% (cf. standard ruthenium dye N3) in DSSC experiments.







Abstract
A consecutive three&#8208;component Heck&#8208;Knoevenagel synthesis of phenothiazinyl merocyanines was developed by statistical design of experiments (DoE) and Bayesian optimization furnishing nine red orange dyes starting from heteroaryl halides, acrolein and ethyl cyanoacetate. Besides scrutinizing the electronic properties of these merocyanines by cyclic voltammetry, absorption and emission spectroscopy, and (TD)DFT calculations their saponified carboxylic acids were employed in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cell (DSSC) experiments showing promising solar cell performances with relative efficiencies of up to 93&#8201;% compared to the standard ruthenium dye N3.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Azido Sugars Using Fluorosulfuryl Azide Diazotransfer Reagent
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An operationally simple protocol for diazotransfer on amine&#8208;containing carbohydrates has been developed. This high&#8208;yielding reaction can be conducted under ambient conditions. Reaction completion is indicated by the colour change of the Cu(II) catalyst. The utility of this protocol in chemical glycosylation has been demonstrated through the preparation of azide&#8208;containing glycosyl donors with orthogonal protecting groups.







Abstract
Azide&#8208;containing sugars are important tools for the synthesis of biologically relevant 1,2&#8208;cis glycosides and for bioconjugation chemistry. Previous strategies to install a non&#8208;participating C2&#8208;azido functionality use harsh conditions and long reaction times. Herein, we report the synthesis of azido sugars using fluorosulfuryl azide (FSO2N3; 1) with a Cu(II) catalyst as a safe and efficient diazotransfer reagent. Common hexosamine substrates were converted to 2&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy sugars in less than 5 minutes in quantitative yield. Glycosyl donors with orthogonal protecting groups were readily prepared from these azido sugars with good overall yield and a single column purification. The diazotransfer protocol was also efficiently applied to other amino sugar derivatives, including aminoglycosides, substrates with amine&#8208;containing linkers, and it is orthogonal to O&#8208;sulfation. This optimized method will expand access to important non&#8208;participating C2&#8208;azido protecting groups and other azido sugar derivatives.

         <title>The Perkin Strategy for the Synthesis of Large Carboxy&#8208;Substituted Polycyclic Aromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 150 year&#8208;old Perkin reaction has been revived and modernized for application to the formation of large carboxy&#8208;substituted polycyclic aromatic compounds. This complete synthetic strategy gives access to a wide variety of structures and geometries.







Abstract
An efficient and versatile synthetic approach has been developed for the synthesis of large carboxy&#8208;substituted polycyclic arenes. This strategy relies on Perkin reactions between arylacetic and arylglyoxylic acids for the formation of flexible precursors. A subsequent rigidification step, by catalyst&#8208; or light&#8208;induced intramolecular cyclization reactions, then yields fully condensed polycyclic aromatic compounds. Protection and deprotection techniques have been developed to allow the controlled assembly of a large number of building blocks. This method can now be applied to the formation of planar or non&#8208;planar, linear or macrocyclic species of various sizes.

         <title>Heteroglycoclusters through Unprecedented Orthogonal Chemistry Based on N&#8208;Alkylation of N&#8208;Acylhydrazone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new orthogonal strategy involving the N&#8208;alkylation of N&#8208;acylhydrazone as a key step. When followed by azido&#8208;alkyne click chemistry, it represents a new and straightforward synthetic method to prepare N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;NAH glycoconjugates of small molecules, heterodisaccharides, and heteroglycoclusters&#8208;based on cone p&#8208;tBu&#8208;calix[4]arene and 1,3&#8208;alt p&#8208;tBu&#8208;thiacalix[4]arene with potential drug&#8208;like properties.







Abstract
Orthogonal chemistry is a valuable tool in the preparation of complex molecules as heteroglycoclusters. Unfortunately, selective heteroconjugation of multifunctional starting materials remains a usually challenging problem to overcome. Herein, we report the first report on harnessing N&#8208;alkylation of N&#8208;acylhydrazone as a key step in the orthogonal synthesis. Sequentially associated with the azido&#8208;alkyne click chemistry, it stands out as a new and straightforward synthetic method of glycoconjugate small molecules, heterodisaccharides, and heteroglycoclusters based on cone p&#8208;tBu&#8208;calix[4]arene and 1,3&#8208;alt p&#8208;tBu&#8208;thiacalix[4]arene with potential drug&#8208;like properties.
