         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;P Cross&#8208;Coupling of (Cyclo)alkenyl/Aryl Bromides and Secondary Phosphine Oxides with in situ Halogen Exchange</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient protocol for concurrent tandem halogen exchange/C&#8208;P cross&#8208;coupling of cycloalkenyl bromides and secondary phosphine oxides has been developed. The catalytic system is based on cheap and air&#8208;stable copper(I) iodide as the precatalyst, commercially available  N,N&#8217;  &#8208;dimethylethylenediamine as the ligand, and Cs  2  CO  3  or K  2  CO  3  as the base. The use of sodium iodide as an additive reduces the excessive use of organic bromides to near&#8208;stoichiometric by promoting the  in situ  transformation to the corresponding iodides. Diarylphosphine oxides undergo cycloalkenylation with 35&#8210;99% yields and dicyclohexylphosphine oxide with 30&#8210;53% yields. In case of non&#8208;cyclic alkenyl bromides cross&#8208;coupling products undergo conjugate addition of diphenylphosphine oxide and satisfying yields are observed only for internal olefins. In case of aryl bromides satisfying yields (43&#8210;72%) are observed only for sterically unhindered arenes or arenes possessing  ortho  &#8208;directing group. Cycloalkenylphosphine oxides prepared in the cross&#8208;coupling reaction undergo base&#8208;catalyzed and base&#8208;promoted conjugate addition to give bis(phosphinoyl)cycloalkanes.</dc:description>

         <title>syn&#8208;Selective Michael Reaction of alpha&#8208;Branched Aryl Acetaldehydes with Nitroolefins Promoted by Squaric Amino Acid Derived Bifunctional Br&#248;nsted Bases</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we describe the direct access to 2,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted  syn  &#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes from the addition reaction of &#945;&#8208;branched aryl acetaldehydes to nitroolefins promoted by a cinchona based squaric acid&#8208;derived amino acid peptide.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of hydrazones to chiral hydrazines has been realized with up to 99% yield and 99.4:0.6 er. Deuterium labelling experiments indicated that the hydrazone substrates undergo imine&#8208;enamine tautomerization in the mixed solvents. Studies on the effects of acids revealed that the required acid assistance promoted the dissociation of the active nickel catalyst in the catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Structures of Tetramesityl&#8208;substituted Tetracyclopenta[def,jkl,pqr,vwx]tetraphenylnene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystal structures of tetramesityl&#8208;substituted tetracyclopenta[  def,jkl,pqr,vwx  ]tetraphenylnene (TCPTP) derivative were determined for crystals containing different solvents, CHCl  3  , CD  2  Cl  2  , acetone, and benzene at different temperatures to discuss the conjugation modes in the antiaromatic system, i.e., whether it adopts a  D  2  h  structure consisting of local aromatic sextets and &#160;quinodimethane substructures or a  D  4  h  double annulenenoid structure. The structures of the TCPTP core in all crystals determined at 113 K or 73 K resemble those of the theoretical  D  2  h  geometry, whereas the bond lengths at room temperature (293 K) adopt averaged values of the theoretical  D  2  h  and  D  4  h  geometries. These results are interpreted in terms of disorder of two perpendicularly oriented  D  2  h  structures at room temperature and support the theoretical prediction which favours the  D  2  h  geometry. The slightly different bond length distributions in the crystals are ascribed to the different space in the vicinity of the molecule which allows the molecule to adopt the two orientations in different occupancies.</dc:description>

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Promoted Regioselective Direct C3&#8208;Phosphinoylation of 2&#8208;Pyridones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 21, Page 3071-3078, June 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Manganese&#8208;promoted direct oxidative C&#8722;P bond formation between 2&#8208;pyridones and secondary phosphine oxides has been developed. The reported protocol proceeds under mild reaction conditions, and the C3&#8208;phosphinoylation is proposed to take place under a radical process in the presence of substoichiometric amount of Mn(II).







Abstract
A highly efficient and regioselective manganese&#8208;induced radical oxidative direct C&#8722;P bond formation between 2&#8208;pyridones and secondary phosphine oxides was developed. The C3&#8208;selective phosphinoylation was conveniently achieved through a combination of substoichiometric manganese and persulfate oxidant under mild conditions. Various 3&#8208;phosphinoylated pyridone products can be obtained in moderate to high yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction is likely to involve a radical pathway induced by catalytically active Mn3+ species.

         <title>Intermolecular Dehydrogenative C&#8722;H/Si&#8722;H Cross&#8208;Coupling for the Synthesis of Arylbenzyl Bis(silanes)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 21, Page 3079-3082, June 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient intermolecular dehydrogenative C&#8722;H/Si&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling to access bis(silane) compounds is described. Under simple and mild conditions, a variety of new functionalized arylbenzyl bis(silane) compounds were obtained in good yields with excellent chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selectivity from readily available starting materials. Further derivatization of the arylbenzyl bis(silanes) demonstrated the rich chemistry of these multi&#8208;functionalized organosilanes, which could be useful as versatile building blocks in synthetic chemistry.







Abstract
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular dehydrogenative C&#8722;H/Si&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling reaction for the synthesis of arylbenzyl bis(silanes) is developed. This hydrosilyl group steered intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation process features high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, giving access to a wide range of multi&#8208;functionalized organosilanes in good yields from readily available starting materials with atom economy, efficiency, and environmental benignity.

&lt;p&gt;An iridium-catalyzed intermolecular dehydrogenative C&#8722;H/Si&#8722;H cross-coupling reaction for the synthesis of arylbenzyl bis(silanes) is developed. This hydrosilyl group steered intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation process features high chemo- and regioselectivity, giving access to a wide range of multi-functionalized organosilanes in good yields from readily available starting materials with atom economy, efficiency, and environmental benignity.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Stereoselective Visible&#8208;Light Catalyzed Cyclization of Bis(enones): A Viable Approach to the Synthesis of Enantiomerically Enriched Cyclopentane Rings</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient protocol for the in&#8208;flow synthesis of enantiomerically enriched functionalized cyclopentane rings has been developed. By exploiting Evans&#8217; oxazolidinones, the stereoselective light&#8208;driven cyclization of bisenones in a coil photoreactor affords, after the removal of the chiral auxiliary, an enantiomerically enriched cyclopentane. The cyclization was also successfully realized in a 3D&#8208;printed mesoreactor.







Abstract
Photoredox catalytic cyclization of aryl enones in the presence of visible light, promoted either by metals or organic dyes, represent a valuable strategy for the synthesis of cycloalkanes. The development of a stereoselective version of such transformation, in the presence of the metal&#8208;free catalyst Eosin Y was studied, with the aim to realize an efficient protocol for the in&#8208;flow synthesis of enantiomerically enriched functionalized cyclopentane rings, taking advantage of the flow reactors technology. The use of a chiral auxiliary on the bisenone to be cyclized offers a straightforward and convenient option to exert a stereocontrol on the light&#8208;driven cyclization. By exploiting Evans&#8217; oxazolidinones, the stereoselective light&#8208;driven cyclization affords, after the removal of the chiral auxiliary, a functionalized 1,2&#8208;trans cyclopentane ring in up to 83/17 enantiomeric ratio. When the reaction was performed in continuo, in a homemade coil photoreactor, high yields were observed. The cyclization was also successfully realized in a 3D&#8208;printed mesoreactor, without any change in the diastereoseletctivity of the process.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free, General Construction of Thioamides from Chlorohydrocarbon, Amide and Elemental Sulfur</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general method for one&#8208;pot synthesis of thioamides is developed through a three&#8208;component reaction involving chlorohydrocarbon, amide and elemental sulfur. Such a strategy does not only avoid residual transition metal in the product but also prevent the generation of C&#8208;N coupling by&#8208;product. The latter is prone to be generated when alkane halide and amine are present. With the protocol proposed in this work, both alkyl and aryl thioamides can be obtained in moderate to excellent yields with a high tolerance of various functional groups. External oxidants are not required in the reaction. In addition, the reaction mechanisms are addressed using a combination of controlling experiments and quantum chemical calculations.</dc:description>

Technical details and applications of the Inverse Virtual Screening computational approach for the target identification of organic compounds are reported. The advantage in the use of this tool in combination with suitable experimental approaches in the frame of the repositioning and identification of anti&#8208;cancer agents is also discussed.







Abstract
The use of computational chemistry techniques has led to notable advances in the structural and pharmacological investigation of organic compounds. The combination of quantum mechanical (QM) approaches with experimental methods (e.&#8201;g., NMR spectroscopy) has contributed to the configurational and conformational structural assignment of the investigated items. Once this information has been obtained, in silico tools have been employed for assessing the pharmacological features of natural and synthetic molecules, especially those lacking precise information about their interacting macromolecules. With this aim, we have developed and implemented the Inverse Virtual Screening (IVS) computational methodology for addressing the target identification task. This minireview focuses on the key technical information and on successful examples about the convenient and fast use of such computational methods in the frame of the drug repositioning and the discovery of anti&#8208;inflammatory/anti&#8208;cancer agents.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of N&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;(S)&#8208;7&#8208;aza&#8208;tryptophan via Alkylation of Chiral Nucleophilic Glycine Equivalent</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 21, Page 2962-2965, June 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for the synthesis of (S)&#8208;7&#8208;aza&#8208;tryptophan via tridentate chiral auxiliary derived Ni(II)&#8208;complexes has been developed. This three&#8208;step synthesis includes alkylation, disassembling and Fmoc&#8208;protection. The desired Fmoc&#8208;L&#8208;7&#8208;AzaTrp&#8208;OH was obtained in over 49&#8201;% yield with excellent diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Ni(II)&#8208;complexes, derived from glycine Schiff bases with chiral tridentate ligands, have been used as powerful tools for the synthesis of structurally diverse tailor&#8208;made amino acids. In this manuscript, asymmetric alkylation reaction between chiral nucleophilic glycine derived Ni&#8208;complex and 3&#8208;(chloromethyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;b]pyridine has been developed under convenient conditions, which affords the corresponding alkylated Ni&#8208;complex in 74&#8201;% yield and excellent diastereoselectivity (only one isomer). This reaction features convenient conditions and completely controlled diastereoselectivity, which provides a highly valuable approach for asymmetric synthesis of 7&#8208;aza&#8208;tryptophan.

     alt="Asymmetric Synthesis of N-Fmoc-(S)-7-aza-tryptophan via Alkylation of Chiral Nucleophilic Glycine Equivalent"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient method for the synthesis of (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-7-aza-tryptophan via tridentate chiral auxiliary derived Ni(II)-complexes has been developed. This three-step synthesis includes alkylation, disassembling and Fmoc-protection. The desired Fmoc-L-7-AzaTrp-OH was obtained in over 49&#8201;% yield with excellent diastereoselectivity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ni(II)-complexes, derived from glycine Schiff bases with chiral tridentate ligands, have been used as powerful tools for the synthesis of structurally diverse tailor-made amino acids. In this manuscript, asymmetric alkylation reaction between chiral nucleophilic glycine derived Ni-complex and 3-(chloromethyl)-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-pyrrolo[2,3-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]pyridine has been developed under convenient conditions, which affords the corresponding alkylated Ni-complex in 74&#8201;% yield and excellent diastereoselectivity (only one isomer). This reaction features convenient conditions and completely controlled diastereoselectivity, which provides a highly valuable approach for asymmetric synthesis of 7-aza-tryptophan.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Absence of Non&#8208;Linear Effects Despite Evidence for Catalyst Aggregation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 21, Page 2916-2922, June 7, 2021. </description>

One might think that the absence of a non&#8208;linear effect (NLE) might necessarily mean that only monomeric complexes catalyze a studied enantioselective reaction. Herein, a counter&#8208;example using an ephedrine&#8208;derived ligand in asymmetric alkylzinc additions is shown. The system is catalyzed by both monomers and dimers, although no NLE is apparent.







Abstract
An in&#8208;depth study of the catalytic system, consisting of the enantioselective addition of ZnEt2 to benzaldehyde with (1R,2S)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;N&#8208;Methylephedrine (NME) as chiral ligand, suggests the presence of dimeric and trimeric aggregates, as deduced from product ee vs. catalyst loading and NMR investigations (1H, DOSY). Formation of catalyst aggregation was excluded in earlier studies as this system displays a linear product ee vs. ligand ee&#8208;correlation, which is usually taken as an indication for the absence of catalyst aggregation. A subsequent theoretical study, using the monomer&#8208;dimer competition model, which we have recently developed, highlights the possible parameter configurations leading to linear product ee vs. ligand ee plots &#8211; despite the presence of catalyst dimers. It shows that, while the Kagan and Noyori models allow linearity in very specific cases only, a multitude of scenarios may lead to linearity here, especially if heterochiral dimers are catalytically active.

         <title>Improved Synthesis of 1&#8208;Glycosyl Thioacetates and Its Application in the Synthesis of Thioglucoside Gliflozin Analogues</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 21, Page 2940-2949, June 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported relative green synthesis of 1&#8208;thioglycosides by straightforward reaction of per&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated glycoses with KSAc in EtOAc. Furthermore, the highly efficient method to synthesize per&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated glycosyl disulfide and glycosyl 1&#8208;thiol were developed. Based on this, the synthesis of auranofin was improved and two thioglucoside gliflozin analogues (possible SGLT inhibitors) were efficiently synthesized in high yields.







Abstract
An improved method to synthesize 1&#8208;glycosyl thioacetates was developed, where per&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated glycoses were allowed to directly react with potassium thioacetate (KSAc) in the presence of BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O in ethyl acetate under mild conditions. This method not only overcomes the disadvantage of the traditional one&#8208;step method, which is that the odorous and toxic thioacetic acid has to be used, but also overcomes the disadvantage of the traditional two&#8208;step method, which is that the unstable intermediate, glycosyl halide, has to be synthesized from the per&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated glycose in advance. Based on this, the per&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated glucosyl disulfide and the per&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated glucosyl 1&#8208;thiol were efficiently synthesized in high yields (91&#8201;% and 90&#8201;% respectively) starting from per&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated glycoses in two&#8208;step without the need to isolate intermediate products. Through metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of per&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated glucosyl 1&#8208;thiol with aryl&#8208;iodide under very mild conditions, two thioglucoside gliflozin analogues were efficiently synthesized in high yields for the first time. These two thioglucoside gliflozin analogues were further confirmed to be stable to hydrolysis of &#946;&#8208;glucosidase.

Progress in enantioselective organocatalysis have enabled efficient and highly stereoselective syntheses of cyclobutane derivatives using (2+2) annulation reactions. Taking advantage of their strain&#8208;releasing fragmentation, cyclobutane derivatives, especially cyclobutanones and cyclobutenones, can now be regarded as versatile four&#8208;carbon atom units amenable to the enantioselective organocatalyzed construction of five&#8208; to eight&#8208;membered rings by (4+n) annulation reactions.







Abstract
The progress in enantioselective organocatalysis have enabled efficient and highly stereoselective syntheses of cyclobutane derivatives, through (2+2) annulation reactions, overcoming the geometrical constraints inherent to these small cyclic molecules. More importantly, and taking advantage of their strain&#8208;releasing fragmentation, some cyclobutane derivatives, especially cyclobutanones and cyclobutenones, can now be regarded as versatile four&#8208;carbon atoms units amenable to the enantioselective construction of larger rings by (4+n) annulation reactions to produce, five&#8208;, six&#8208;, seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered cyclic products. These recent developments concerning the enantioselective synthetic chemistry of cyclobutane derivatives under organocatalytic conditions are reviewed herein.

We developed a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of benzoyl formic acids in the presence of toluene to form the important 2&#8208;phenylacetophenones analogues. Additionally, we obtained various substituted 2&#8208;phenylacetophenones in moderate to good yields. Preliminary mechanistic analysis revealed that the reaction proceeded via a free radical pathway, and the ruthenium catalyst played an important role in the decarboxylation reaction.







Abstract
Herein, we report a direct method to synthesize 2&#8208;phenylacetophenone through a ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction between acyl and benzyl radical. The various derivatives of 2&#8208;phenylacetophenone were prepared easily in moderate to good yields. These reactions provide a straightforward pathway to synthesize a variety of ketones bearing various functional groups.

An efficient Lewis base catalytic protocol to biologically important trifluoromethylated pyrazolines and pyrazoles is developed through [3+2] triazene&#8208;heterocycilc alkene cycloaddition reactions of an array of oxa&#8208;/aza&#8208;benzonorbornadienes and coumarins with CF3CHN2. This approach features good functional group tolerance and scaffold diversity. Synthetic utility of the protocol is highlighted by late&#8208;stage functionalization of known natural products.

This review describes the synthetic strategies to prepare &#946;&#8208;hydroxy hydroperoxides (&#946;&#8208;hydroperoxy alcohols) and presents their main applications in organic chemistry.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Hydroxy hydroperoxides (&#946;&#8208;hydroperoxy alcohols) are interesting chemical platforms, notably for the preparation of 1,2,4&#8208;trioxanes, that are key features of numerous bioactive products such as artemisinin. In this review, the main synthetic methods to prepare &#946;&#8208;hydroxy hydroperoxides are presented, such as the photooxidation of allylic alcohols with singlet oxygen and the ring&#8208;opening of epoxides with H2O2. The main applications of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy hydroperoxides are also detailed, including their peracetalization to 1,2,4&#8208;trioxanes, their use as epoxidating agents and their fragmentation to carbonyl compounds. A final section is dedicated to the general characteristics and practical aspects of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy hydroperoxides, including their stability, safety and characterization through spectroscopic means.

The ability of intermolecular cooperative thiourea/oxime hydrogen&#8208;bond catalysis for improving and accelerating asymmetric aminocatalysis is disclosed. The two readily available hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donating catalysts operate in synergy with a chiral amine catalyst to accomplish a plethora of highly stereoselective transformations.







Abstract
The ability of intermolecular cooperative thiourea/oxime hydrogen&#8208;bond catalysis for improving and accelerating asymmetric aminocatalysis is presented. The two readily available hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donating catalysts operates in synergy with a chiral amine catalyst to accomplish highly stereoselective transformations. The synergistic catalyst systems simultaneously activate both electrophiles and nucleophiles, and make the transformations more chemo&#8208; and stereoselective. This was exemplified by performing co&#8208;catalytic enantioselective direct intermolecular &#945;&#8208;alkylation reactions of aldehydes, direct aldol reactions, and asymmetric conjugate reactions, which gave the corresponding products in high yields and enantiomeric ratios.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Difluorinated &#946;&#8208;Amino Sulfones through Detrifluoroacetylative Mannich Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 21, Page 3035-3038, June 7, 2021. </description>

Asymmetric Mannich reaction of fluoroalkyl sulfinyl imines with detrifluoroacetylatively in&#8197;situ generated fluoro&#8208;enalotes from &#945;&#8208;fluorinated arylsulfonyl gem&#8208;diols has been developed. The reactions afford &#945;&#8208;fluorinated aryl sulfons in good yields and high diastereoselectivities (up to 86&#8201;% yield, &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr). This method represents the first example of this type of sulfone&#8208;derived gem&#8208;diols and provides an efficient access to chiral fluorinated amino sulfones and difluoromethyl&#8208;containing compounds.







Abstract
Asymmetric detrifluoroacetylative Mannich reactions between &#945;&#8208;fluorinated arylsulfonyl gem&#8208;diols and fluoroalkyl imines have been developed under operationally convenient conditions. Varieties of &#945;&#8208;fluorinated arylsulfonyl gem&#8208;diols and fluoroalkyl imines are well tolerated with the corresponding &#945;&#8208;difluorinated &#946;&#8208;amino sulfone products generated in moderate to excellent yields as well as high diastereoselectivity. The reaction can be reproduced on gram&#8208;scale with uncompromised yield and stereochemical outcome. The synthetic value of the products is demonstrated by two transformations by means of desulfonylation and removal of the sulfinyl protecting&#8208;group.

A metal&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot selenium mediated electrophilic cyclization reaction of alkynes and triflic anhydride&#8208;activated selenoxides was realized, giving selenium containing dihydronaphthalene products, including selenium&#8208;substituted phenanthrene, dihydroquinoline, 2H&#8208;chromene, and coumarin.







Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, selenium mediated electrophilic cyclization reaction was realized through a one&#8208;pot procedure between simple alkynes and triflic anhydride&#8208;activated selenoxides to give selenium containing dihydronaphthalene products. This method gave good to very high yields for all products, including selenium&#8208;substituted phenanthrene, dihydroquinoline, 2H&#8208;chromene, and coumarin, which can be further transformed to other functionalized compounds.

Described herein, the chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective ring expansion of silacyclobutanes to sila&#8208;8&#8208;membered ring fused biaryl skeletons, enabled by Pd&#8208;catalytic conditions. This strategy involves C&#8722;C bond cleavage or C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H bond activation and C&#8722;Si bond cleavage followed by a double reductive elimination process. DFT calculations indicate that the C&#8722;H bond activation or C&#8722;C bond cleavage to form palladacycle species is more energetically favourable than C&#8722;Si bond cleavage of silacyclobutanes at the beginning.







Abstract
Investigations of the sila&#8208;8&#8208;membered ring fused biaryls are of high significance for the discovery of new drug lead compounds. However, such compounds are still unknown due to the synthetic challenge. Herein, we describe the chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective cross&#8208;dimerization of 5&#8208;membered palladacycles with silacyclobutanes enabled by Pd&#8208;catalytic conditions, which constitutes an expedient ring expansion route to the sila&#8208;8&#8208;membered ring fused biaryl skeletons.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Intramolecular (Hetero)Michael Additions in Desymmetrization Processes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 21, Page 2923-2939, June 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organocatalytic desymmetrization reactions are powerful methodologies for the generation of molecular complexity and the creation of multiple stereocenters in a single operation. The use of intramolecular (hetero)&#8208;Michael reactions in desymmetrization processes using carbon&#8208;, oxygen&#8208;, and nitrogen&#8208;centered nucleophiles allowed for the creation of polycyclic carbo&#8208; and heterocycles with excellent levels of diastero&#8208; and enantiocontrol.







Abstract
The organocatalytic enantioselective desymmetrization reaction by means of an intramolecular (hetero)Michael addition is a useful strategy for the creation of complex carbo&#8208; and heterocycles with the generation of multiple stereocenters in a very simple manner. The intramolecular addition of carbon, oxygen and nitrogen nucleophiles to prochiral substrates bearing electronically deficient olefins takes place in the presence of organocatalysts, such as chiral primary and secondary amines, NHCs, ureas, thioureas, and BINOL phosphoric acid derivatives, reaching high levels of diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. The main bottleneck of this methodology is the design and synthesis of the starting materials, which compromises its application. To date, the majority of examples are related to the use of 1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedione derivatives.

         <title>Total Synthesis of a Hypothetical Macroketone of Migrastatin</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 21, Page 3050-3053, June 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have accomplished the synthesis of &#8216;hypothetical macroketone&#8217; (a novel migrastatin analogue) for the first time. We have used TiCl4 mediated vinylogous Mukaiyama aldol reaction (VMAR) to establish the required three stereocenters on the key intermediate. Grubbs&#8217; 2nd generation catalyzed RCM reaction was utilized to construct the 14 membered ring macrocycle.







Abstract
Danishefsky's macroketone, a simplified analogue of natural product Migrastatin, is one of the lead compounds with potent cancer cell migration inhibition potential. Different biological assays suggest fascin protein as the potential target. Although it was indicated through X&#8208;ray co&#8208;crystallography where the concerned macroketone analogue was found to bind in the actin&#8208;binding sites of fascin, there was a structural discrepancy, as the X&#8208;ray co&#8208;crystal structure suggested an E&#8208;olefin along with inversion of methyl stereochemistry from that of Danishefsky's macroketone. Here, we have accomplished the total synthesis of the &#8216;hypothetical macroketone&#8217; for the first time. The TiCl4 mediated vinylogous Mukaiyama aldol reaction is the key step in present synthesis.

The Front Cover shows Mont Aiguille, located in the Vercors massif, France. The limestone cliffs of Mont Aiguille are very popular with climbers. Its first climb in 1492 would have marked the birth of mountaineering. From a chemist&#8242;s point of view, the sea of fog can hide a complex landscape as in the case of asymmetric catalysis where linearity between product ee and ligand ee cannot allow to conclude on the exact mechanism. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Bellemin&#8208;Laponnaz et&#8197;al.

Bioinspired manipulation of o&#8208;quinones generated from natural catechols represents a straightforward strategy to access the diverse molecular scaffolds endowed with peculiar functional chromophores, which offers a finely tunable palette of colors, emissions and input/output opportunities in response to pH, light, oxidant species and other external stimuli, of potential. This Minireview highlights the main types of chromophoric systems obtained by biomimetic chemistry or synthetic manipulation of nature&#8208;inspired o&#8208;quinones.







Abstract
A concise highlight of the main types of chromophoric systems obtained in the authors&#8217; and other laboratories through biomimetic chemistry or synthetic manipulation of nature&#8208;inspired o&#8208;quinones is the primary focus of this Minireview. Following oxidative conversion of a variety of natural catechol substrates like DOPA, dopamine, 5&#8208;S&#8208;cysteinyldopa and caffeic acid, in the presence of suitable additives, a remarkable variety of chromophoric systems can be produced, which display specific optical and electronic properties, e.&#8201;g. acidichromism, solvatochromism or strong emission upon excitation. Such properties can be tailored for specific applications through rational synthetic manipulations and/or fine&#8208;tuning through non&#8208;covalent and supramolecular interactions. Practical access routes to the reported o&#8208;quinone&#8208;derived chromophoric systems are illustrated along with the main prospective applications.

A simple method for C&#8722;N bond formation is disclosed by using cinnamyl alcohols and 2&#8208;amino pyridine derivatives in the presence of stoichiometric amount of zinc bromide. This reaction works with a wide range of substrates, and is compatible with primary, secondary, and homoallylic alcohols. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report for C&#8722;N bond formation using cinnamyl alcohol and 2&#8208;amino pyridines using zinc bromide as a Lewis acid.

Abstract
A cross dehydrogenative coupling reaction of tetrahydroisoquinolines with 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzodithiole&#8208;1,1,3,3&#8208;tetraoxide had been developed. CuBr/TBHP was identified as the best catalyst and oxidant. A variety of coupling products were obtained with good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. 1&#8208;Monofluoromethyl tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives were prepared via a subsequent desulfonylation with sodium amalgam. This method provides a new synthetic approach to &#945;&#8208;monofluoromethyl tertiary amines.

         <title>Recent Advances in Direct C&#8208;H Radical Alkylation of 1,4&#8208;Quinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,4&#8208;Quinones display unique redox and biological properties and have multiple applications in a wide array of fields, including health. Synthesis of diversely&#8208;substituted quinone&#8208;based compounds remains difficult and usually consists of multiple step sequences. Interest in direct C&#8208;H radical alkylation of 1,4&#8208;quinones has thus continuously grown over this last decade. These reactions involve addition of carbon&#8208;centered radicals generated from radical precursors through decarboxylative alkylation, hydrogen&#8208;atom abstraction, or by carbon&#8208;halogen bond reduction. Recent progresses in radical chemistry, including photoredox catalysis, have provided useful tools for quinone functionalization. This review describes the recent progress with these methodologies, including the new promising three&#8208;component cascade reactions involving quinones and alkenes, allowing the preparation of complex substituted 1,4&#8208;quinones in a single step.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical and biophysical approaches to allosteric modulation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allosteric regulation, i.e. the control exerted on an orthosteric site by an effector interacting at a distinct and distant site, represents a prime example of a precise tuning system of several key biological processes like gene transcription, cell adhesion and, most importantly, signal transduction. Since its discovery sixty years ago, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have been extensively investigated. The aim of this minireview is to introduce the reader to the topic of protein allostery. In particular, we briefly overview the allosteric models postulated over the years and we describe the most relevant chemical and biophysical approaches reported so far for the identification of putative allosteric sites and/or for the investigation of allosteric signal propagation throughout the protein. An outlook of the main computational and experimental methods is followed by four case studies representative of different proteins classes: enzymes, hub proteins, cell receptors and intrinsically disordered proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Microwave assisted 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of azomethine ylides to [60]fullerene: thermodynamic control of bis&#8208;addition with ionic liquids additives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cycloaddition of azomethine ylides to [60]fullerene (C  60  ) has been studied in ortho&#8208;dichlorobenzene (  o  &#8208;DCB) by evaluating the impact of an ionic liquid (IL) additive. The solvent effect has been addressed by evaluating the activation parameters of the cycloaddition and the boosting effect of the MW induced dielectric heating. The IL additive plays a twofold role of stabilizing the dipolar ylide intermediate and favoring the retro&#8208;cycloaddition at high temperature regime. Under the conditions explored, a combined kinetic and thermodynamic preference favors the selective formation of  trans  bis&#8208;fulleropyrrolidine regioisomers, in agreement with the DFT computational analysis.</dc:description>

Mechanistic studies of the triazolium ion&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular Stetter reaction using initial rates analysis in NEt3/NEt3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HCl buffered methanol showed the reaction to be first order in catalyst and zero order in aldehyde.

Abstract
Mechanistic studies of the triazolium ion&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular Stetter reaction using initial rates analysis in NEt3/NEt3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HCl buffered methanol showed the reaction to be first&#8208;order in catalyst and zero&#8208;order in aldehyde over a broad range of aldehyde concentrations. The observed reaction rate is higher for catalysts bearing N&#8208;aryl substituents with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. A concurrent, NHC&#8208;independent substrate isomerization was also observed and found to demonstrate a first&#8208;order dependence on aldehyde concentration. The reported data are consistent with deprotonation to form the Breslow intermediate being turnover&#8208;limiting in this process.

         <title>In Focus: Reactivity and Applications of Iodine Monochloride in Synthetic Approaches</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the last half&#8208;decade, routes towards accessing halogenated compounds of value such as bioactive pharmaceuticals, organic building blocks has been of interest to the synthetic community. The demand for new methodologies to access important compounds has surged over the period. Amongst the halogenating agents available in a chemists toolbox, one reagent in particular, iodine monochloride (ICl), is relatively under employed in comparison to alternatives such as molecular iodine for example. In this minireview, we document the most recent applications (2015&#8208;2020) of ICl in synthetic organic transformations, namely halogenations including iodinations and chlorination reactions, cyclizations / metathesis reactions and also oxidation processes. Furthermore, its ambidextrous nature and interesting properties will be discussed, through its advantages and downfalls over other halogenating reagents, and discussions where relevant to compare modes of reactivity and mechanistic insights is presented.</dc:description>

Furthermore, its ambidextrous nature and interesting properties will be discussed, through its advantages and downfalls over other halogenating reagents, and discussions where relevant to compare modes of reactivity and mechanistic insights is presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supported synthesis of adenosine nucleotides and derivatives on a benzene&#8208;centred tripodal soluble support</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first soluble&#8208;phase synthesis of adenosine nucleotides including  &#945;  ,  &#946;  and  &#946;  ,  &#947;  &#8208;methylene bisphosphonates analogues on a multipod support is reported. Anchoring of a 2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;protected purine nucleoside to the tripodal support via the nucleobase was successfully achieved using a microwave assisted Cu  I  &#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition. Then, phosphorylation was performed, followed by cleavage with aqueous ammonia to provide adenine derivatives, and finally deprotection. When using benzylamine instead of ammonia, a derivative with  N  6  &#8208;benzylamine adenine as nucleobase was obtained. This methodology allows to access adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;mono, di and triphosphates, as well as various analogues of pharmacological interest in modest to good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxonium ylides generated from 1,4&#8208;disubstituted &#945;&#8208;diazo glutaconimides: a rich source of diverse oxygen heterocyclic frameworks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An underexplored type of heterocyclic &#945;&#8208;diazocarbonyl compounds, &#945;&#8208;diazo glutaconimides was involved in generation of oxonium ylide species on Rh(II) catalysis in the presence of tetrahydrofuran and 1,4&#8208;dioxane. The formation of a spirocycle  via  a formal Stevens&#8208;type  O  &#8594;  C  [1,2]&#8208;shift within the oxonium ylide species in the case of THF was low&#8208;yielding and was accompanied by the known formal  O  &#8594;  O  [1,4]&#8208;shift to give fused bicyclic products. Reactions with 1,4&#8208;dioxane proved noticeably more high&#8208;yielding with respect to the target spirocycle. In this case, however, the observed by&#8208;products resulted from hitherto not described alternative formal  O  &#8594;  C  [1,4]&#8208;shift accompanied by the transposition of the double bond. The latter fate of the oxonium ylide species, however minor, is likely attributable to the unique nature of &#945;&#8208;diazo glutaconimides as precursors to Rh(II) carbenes and subsequently formed oxonium ylide.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Study of Domino Processes Involving the Bidentate Lewis Acid Catalyzed Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The detailed understanding of mechanisms is the basis to design new reactions. Herein, we studied the domino bidentate Lewis acid catalyzed inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder (IEDDA) reaction developed in our laboratory computationally as well as with support by synthetic experiments. That way, we could characterize different pathways. A quinodimethane intermediate was identified as key structure, which is the basis for all subsequent transformations: Elimination to an aromatic naphthalene, rearrangement to a dihydroaminonaphthalene and a photo&#8208;induced ring opening. These insights allow to optimize reaction conditions, such as catalytic utilization of amine, as well as to advance new reactions in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroaliphatic dimethylphosphine oxide building blocks: synthesis and physico&#8208;chemical properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Scalable synthesis of saturated heterocyclic dimethyl&#173;phosphine oxides (derivatives of azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, and morpholine) is disclosed. The key steps of the synthesis relied on the reactions of HP(O)Me2, i.e. the phospha&#8208;Mannich (the Kabachnik&#8211;Fields&#8208;type) condensation with cyclic imines or mono&#173;protected diamines, palladium&#8208;catalyzed reactions of alkenyl halides or trifltates (generated from cyclic ketones), as well as base&#8208;mediated nucleophilic substitution, Michael addition, or oxirane ring opening. It was shown that introducing the P(O)Me2 group into the saturated heterocyclic core had very strong impact on the compound&#8217;s basicity: the corresponding &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;isomeric derivatives were by ca. 4, 2, and 1.6 pKa units less basic, respect&#173;tively, as compared to the parent saturated heterocycle. Meanwhile, the P(O)Me2&#8208;substituted compound was more basic than its SO2i&#8208;Pr and SO2NMe2&#8208;containing isosteres (by ca. 1.2 and 0.4 pKa units, respectively). It was also demonstrated that the P(O)Me2 group typically increased the compound&#8217;s hydrophilicity and aqueous solubility. In particular, the LogP values for the corresponding derivatives were by ca. 1.4&#8211;1.7 and 0.6 units lower than for the non&#8208;substituted counterpart and sulfonamide/sulfone isosteres, respectively. Finally, a potential of the synthesized building blocks to generate lead&#8208;like three&#8208;dimensional compound libraries was confirmed using the Nelson&#8217;s LLAMA tool.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We developed a novel method for direct C3 carbamoylation of 2  H  &#8208;indazoles using oxamic acids as carbamoyl radical sources. In the presence of ammonium persulfate, carbamoyl radicals were generated from oxamic acids, then used for further reactions with 2  H  &#8208;indazoles to afford the desired products. The reaction proceeds under metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free conditions. This simple process allows for the efficient synthesis of C3 carbamoylated 2  H  &#8208;indazoles, which are important scaffolds in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>&#969;&#8208;Alkenylallylboronates: Design, Synthesis and Application to the Asymmetric Allylation / RCM Tandem Sequence</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>the synthesis of allylboronates bearing an alkenyl moiety appended at a remote position is described for the first time. For that aim, the palladium&#8208;catalyzed borylation of the corresponding allylic alcohols was used as the key step. The required allylic alcohols were in turn obtained in 3&#8208;4 step sequences. The presence of an extra alkenyl moiety at a strategic position allows triggering a tandem asymmetric allylation/RCM reaction sequence that efficiently affords different sized cycles featuring two consecutive stereocenters and an exocyclic alcohol function. Products are obtained in moderate to excellent yields and high enantioselectivities, in most of the cases.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Regioselective Remote C&#8208;H Bond 2,2,2&#8208;Trifluoroethoxylation of 8&#8208;Aminoquinoline Derivatives at the C5 Position</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regioselective 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethoxylation at the C5 position of amides derived from the 8&#8208;aminoquinoline has been developed. In the presence of PIDA, an unprecedented and undirected transition metal&#8208;free transformation was achieved using the readily available and appealing 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol as the fluorinated source. The selective distal 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethoxylation of an array of amides was achieved in moderate to good yields (12 examples, up to 61% yield). This approach provided efficient access to high&#8208;value added fluorinated quinoline derivatives, key building blocks for bulk and fine chemical industry.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The trick is a switch. The Staudinger synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactams has never been performed as a three&#8208;component reaction, mixing amines, carbonyl derivatives and ketene precursors. Recent advances in the visible light mediated Wolff rearrangement of diazoketones allowed us to perform, for the first time, a 3&#8208;component Staudinger reaction, by mixing the reagents in the dark and switching the light on after imine formation. The new photoinduced reaction parallels the classic methods in terms of efficiency and selectivity, and adds to the existing multicomponent approaches for the preparation of combinatorial libraries of compounds. A thorough optimization of the reaction conditions was performed both for the  classic  two component reaction and for the novel three component version of the photoinduced Staudinger reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and racemization studies of winding vine&#8208;shaped biphenyl derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Winding vine&#8208;shaped biphenyl derivatives were synthesized through the annulation reaction of nosylated (2&#8208;nitrobenzenesulfonyl) ethylenediamine and the  E  &#8208;selective ring&#8208;closing metathesis reaction. The structure of the cyclized products were confirmed by measurements of  1  H and  13  C NMR spectra and single crystal X&#8208;ray analyses. The obtained cyclic product was revealed to exhibit molecular asymmetry, which was confirmed by HPLC analyses on chiral stationary phase. Compared with our previous results on the related bithiophene derivatives, the obtained vine&#8208;shaped biphenyls were shown to hardly racemize under ambient conditions and experimental studies on racemization behaviors suggested energy barriers of 134 kJmol  &#8208;1  to 211 kJmol  &#8208;1  . These results reasonably agreed with those of the calculated values based on DFT.</dc:description>

         <title>Studies Toward the Total Synthesis of Schinortriterpenoids: Diastereoselective Synthesis of the Left&#8208;Hand Fragment</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schinortriterpenoids, such as pre&#8208;schisanartanin A and arisanlactone C, are complex and highly oxygenated polycyclic terpenes. The left&#8208;hand fragment of this class terpenes, which possesses oxygen&#8208;functionality at C19, has been synthesized through [3+2] cycloaddition with excellent diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Schinortriterpenoids, such as pre&#8208;schisanartanin A and arisanlactone C, are complex and highly oxygenated polycyclic terpenes. In this study, the left&#8208;hand fragment of this class terpenes, which possesses oxygen&#8208;functionality at C19, was synthesized through [3+2] cycloaddition with excellent diastereoselectivity. This stereoselectivity was investigated by computational studies. Further selective transformation provided a tricyclic skeleton with the desired stereochemistry.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Sonogashira Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions of gem&#8208;Dibromovinyl BODIPY Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows the methodology for the synthesis of diversified &#8220;Y&#8208;enyene&#8221; BODIPY derivatives, obtained through the Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira coupling reaction of gem&#8208;dibromo BODIPY and alkyne derivatives. The coupling products possess interesting spectral properties (UV/Vis and fluorescence), providing the potential to develop fluorescence probes and photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy (PDT). Protonation of dimethylaminphenyl substituted BODIPYs induces changes in their spectral properties, from fluorescence off&#8208;to&#8208;on. Their strong electrochromic properties render these derivatives most suitable for the construction of multifunctional electro&#8208; and photo&#8208;chemical molecular switches. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;E. van&#8197;Lier et&#8197;al.

         <title>Buckyball as an Electron Donor in a Dyad of C60 and Xanthene Dye</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows electron transfer from a photoexcited fullerene to a strong electron acceptor. By connecting the xanthylium moiety to the typical electron acceptor, fullerene, the electron transfer was achieved with fullerene as the electron donor, contrary to the usual case.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Front Cover&lt;/b&gt; shows electron transfer from a photoexcited fullerene to a strong electron acceptor. By connecting the xanthylium moiety to the typical electron acceptor, fullerene, the electron transfer was achieved with fullerene as the electron donor, contrary to the usual case. The formed fullerene radical cation was confirmed by transient absorption spectra. More information can be found in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ejoc.202100276"&gt;Communication by H.

         <title>Haloacetylated enol ethers: a way out for the regioselective synthesis of biologically active heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review describes advances in the synthesis of heterocyclic scaffolds (associated with their biological activity), using haloacetylated enol ethers as precursors. The wide variety of heterocycles that can be prepared using these precursors, together with the high regioselectivity they usually provide in type [3+2] and [3+3] cyclocondensation reactions, makes these powerful starting materials one may have in hand. The biological evaluation is also highlighted, given that several analogues of commercially available drugs can be easily accessed.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted cyclobutanones by the Suzuki reaction and dephosphorylation sequence.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a novel process for the preparation of 2&#8208;substituted cyclobutanones that relies on the cross&#8208;coupling reaction of diethyl bromocyclobutenyl phosphate with either boronic acids or organozinc reagents. The dephosphorylation of the prepared 2&#8208;substituted cyclobutenyl phosphates completes the preparation of the 2&#8208;substituted cyclobutanones. We observed that the course of the dephosphorylation reaction depends on the properties of the substituents found on the cyclobutene nucleus. The presence of groups capable of stabilizing the negative charge is necessary for the opening of the cyclobutanone ring. The scope of the reported novel process for the preparation of 2&#8208;substituted cyclobutanones has also been extended to the preparation of cyclobutenyl sulfides.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Imidazolium Salts as Bright Multi&#8208;Faceted Tools for Biology</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light and cognate phenomena, e.g., luminescence are powerful tools endowed with great sensitivity to explore the infinitely small. Molecular salts, especially those based on imidazolium units, are granted with original properties and structural versatility. Associated with fluorophores, they constitute highly bioavailable platforms. Their interactions with negatively charged species and biological membranes as well as their controllable cytotoxicity imparted them applications as anion receptors, but also a promising potential as antibacterial and anticancer agents whose mechanism of action can be observed using luminescence, opening the possibility of theranostics (therapy and diagnosis). One of imidazolium salts other assets is their flexible amphipathic character which promotes their self&#8208;organizations into liquid&#8208;crystal mesophases and their ability to mimic lipids. Combining luminescence to these amphipathic properties opens new prospects, e.g., following gene or drug delivery inside cells. These salts, all&#8208;in&#8208;one, should lead to new tools for biologists, as well as active theranostic molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermolecular photoredox coupling: Alternative to Norrish type II reaction and Yang cyclization in ketones with &#947;&#8208;C&#8208;H bonds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new reaction pathway for&#160;the photoconversion of butyrophenone in acetonitrile was investigated. In addition to the classic intramolecular photoreactivity of ketones with &#947;&#8208;C&#8208;H bonds (Norrish type II fragmentation and Yang cyclization), intermolecular generated species were isolated and characterized: 1,2&#8208;dibenzoylethane, 2&#8208;phenacylacetonitrile (oxidized species) and pinacols (reduced species). They account for approx. 20% of the converted starting material, similar to the Yang product. The acetophenone enol intermediate, formed in situ via the Norrish type II reaction, has been identified as an H&#8208;atom donor for the main intermolecular reaction steps, and has been distinguished from other conceivable mechanistic possibilities. Experimental results with analogue compounds suggest that the intermolecular product formation pathway may be of general relevance.</dc:description>

         <title>Buckyball as an Electron Donor in a Dyad of C60 and Xanthene Dye</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By coupling a stronger electron acceptor xanthylium to the typical electron acceptor fullerene C60, photoinduced electron transfer with the fullerene as the electron donor was achieved, and the dynamics of fullerene radical cation formation was analyzed by transient absorption spectroscopy.







Abstract
We successfully achieved the synthesis of C60&#8208;xanthlium, X60_NTf2, where fullerene is an electron donor and xanthlium is an electron acceptor. When the precursor compound X60&#8208;OH was excited at 550&#8197;nm, the C60 emission was observed at 715&#8197;nm. On the other hand, the fluorescence of X60_NTf2 was completely quenched under the same conditions, suggesting that photo&#8208;induced intramolecular electron transfer (ET) occurred from the singlet excited state of C60. The electrochemical measurement proved that the X60_NTf2 is exothermically possible of ET reaction from 1C60* to xanthylium to form C60.+. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the acceptor ability of the xanthylium by showing that the coefficients of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) were on xanthene moiety. This is a well&#8208;arranged model compound to investigate the properties of transiently generated fullerene radical cations.

&lt;p&gt;We successfully achieved the synthesis of C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;-xanthlium, &lt;b&gt;X60_NTf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, where fullerene is an &lt;i&gt;electron donor&lt;/i&gt; and xanthlium is an &lt;i&gt;electron acceptor&lt;/i&gt;. When the precursor compound &lt;b&gt;X60-OH&lt;/b&gt; was excited at 550&#8197;nm, the C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; emission was observed at 715&#8197;nm. On the other hand, the fluorescence of &lt;b&gt;X60_NTf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; was completely quenched under the same conditions, suggesting that photo-induced intramolecular electron transfer (ET) occurred from the singlet excited state of C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;. The electrochemical measurement proved that the &lt;b&gt;X60_NTf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; is exothermically possible of ET reaction from &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;* to xanthylium to form C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;.+&lt;/sup&gt;. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the acceptor ability of the xanthylium by showing that the coefficients of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) were on xanthene moiety. This is a well-arranged model compound to investigate the properties of transiently generated fullerene radical cations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Annulative Dimerization of Carbohydrates: Synthesis of complex C2&#8208;Symmetrical 1,4&#8208;Dioxane&#8208;Sugar Hybrids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of carbohydrate&#8208;heterocycle hybrid molecules has led to several interesting biologically active products. In this work, we have developed an annulative process for the formation of novel  C  2  &#8208;symmetrical 1,4&#8208;dioxane&#8208;carbohydrate hybrid compounds. Starting from simple sugars, original 6&#8208;6&#8208;6 heterocyclic frameworks were isolated. The dioxane units adopted a rare 1,4 twist&#8208;boat conformations in the liquid and solid&#8208;states. Synthetic derivatization allowed the preparation of  C  2  &#8208;symmetrical glycomimetics that could be used for further biological investigations.</dc:description>

         <title>Mustard Carbonate Analogues as Sustainable Reagents for the Aminoalkylation of Phenols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows the one&#8208;pot procedure for the introduction of aminoalkyl chain through dialkyl carbonate chemistry into different phenolic substrates. This green approach is a direct alcohol substitution that avoids the use of chlorine chemistry giving CO2 and ethanol as the only reaction by&#8208;products. The proposed procedure has numerous potential applications as N,N&#8208;dialkyl ethylamine moieties are incorporated in many pharmacophore scaffolds such as Tamoxifen, Raloxifene, Amiodarone, Phenyltoloxamine and Trifenagrel. The authors thank Thomas Bassano for creating the artwork. More information can be found in the Communication by F. Aric&#242; et&#8197;al.

         <title>A Structure&#8208;Activity Investigation on Modified Analogues of an Argininocalixarene Based Non&#8208;viral Gene Vector</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of eight novel calix[4]arene&#8208;cone amphiphiles bearing different types and numbers of cationic headgroups at the upper rim and different alkyl chains at the lower rim were synthesized and studied in pDNA binding and cell transfection in order to dissect the role of each of these structural elements on gene delivery properties of this promising class of non&#8208;viral vectors.







Abstract
The tetra&#8208;L&#8208;arginino&#8208;tetrahexyloxycalix[4]arene 1 has shown extraordinary abilities to compact and internalize different types of Nucleid Acid cargos (DNA, microRNA, PNA) into cells even known to be transfected with great difficulties by commercial non&#8208;viral gene delivery systems. This activity, accompanied by negligible toxicity, makes this calixarene a rather promising prototype of vector for Gene Therapy. In this study we report how small structural changes like i) the lower rim alkyl substituents, ii) the type of the terminal cationic headgroups (guanidinium or primary ammonium), iii) the length of the linker between the macrocycle and the terminal cationic headgroup, iv) the presence/absence of the basic &#945;&#8208;amino group of Arg, and v) the stereochemistry (L or D) of Arg, might affect the ability of the novel calixarene vectors to compact DNA and to deliver its cargo into the cells.

         <title>Mustard Carbonate Analogues as Sustainable Reagents for the Aminoalkylation of Phenols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nitrogen mustard gas moiety is present as a basic, amine&#8208;containing side chain in numerous pharmacophore scaffolds engaging in crucial interactions with targeted biological macromolecules. Herein, a one&#8208;pot synthetic approach for the easy introduction of nitrogen mustard&#8208;like moieties through dialkyl carbonate chemistry into different phenolic substrates is reported. The scope and limitations of this reaction as a chlorine&#8208;free direct substitution of the phenolic &#8722;OH group have been investigated.







Abstract
N,N&#8208;dialkyl ethylamine moiety can be found in numerous scaffolds of macromolecules, catalysts, and especially pharmaceuticals. Common synthetic procedures for its incorporation in a substrate relies on the use of a nitrogen mustard gas or on multistep syntheses featuring chlorine hazardous/toxic chemistry. Reported herein is a one&#8208;pot synthetic approach for the easy introduction of aminoalkyl chain into different phenolic substrates through dialkyl carbonate (&#946;&#8208;aminocarbonate) chemistry. This new direct alcohol substitution avoids the use of chlorine chemistry, and it is efficient on numerous pharmacophore scaffolds with good to quantitative yield. The cytotoxicity via MTT of the &#946;&#8208;aminocarbonate, key intermediate of this synthetic approach, was also evaluated and compared with its alcohol precursor.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aerobic visible&#8208;light induced intermolecular S&#8208;N bond construction to synthesize 1,2,4&#8208;thiadiazoles from thioamides has been achieved without the addition of a photosensitizer, metal, or base. The excited state of the thioamide undergoes a single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer (SET) process to afford a thioamidyl radical, which is further transformed into a 1,2,4&#8208;thiadiazole through desulfurization and oxidative cyclization. The reaction has good functional group tolerance, and provides a green method for the construction of S&#8208;N bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioisomers of organic semiconducting dumbbell&#8208;shaped molecules: synthesis and structure&#8208;properties relationship</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new dumbbell&#8208;shaped molecules based on two solubilizing and structuring triazatruxene (TAT) units linked by a central chromophore were synthesized and studied. The central chromophore was an electro&#8208;deficient fluorene&#8208;malononitrile (FM) unit, that can be functionalized symmetrically on two different positions, giving rise to two positional isomers, called TAT&#8208;  p  FM and TAT&#8208;  m  FM, when the TATs are connected to the 2,7&#8208; and 3,6&#8208;positions, respectively. The two isomers exhibited different electronic conjugation pathways that drastically affect their absorption properties and energy levels. Moreover, while TAT&#8208;  p  FM was organized in a stable 3D mesomorphic structure from room&#8208;temperature to the melting, TAT&#8208;  m  FM remained crystalline and decomposed before melting. Finally, despite a lower hole mobility, the TAT&#8208;  m  FM exhibited the highest Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE) of about 2% in organic solar cells. This higher PCE was attributed essentially to the pronounced internal charge transfer band contribution to the charge photogeneration observed in TAT&#8208;  m  FM solar cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct trifluoromethoxylation without OCF3 &#8208;carrier via in&#8208;situ generation of fluorophosgene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to the high interest into the OCF 3group for pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications, trifluoromethoxylation received great attention in the last years with several new methods to perform it. Yet, it most often requires the beforehand preparation of specific F3 CO &#8211; transfer reagents, which can be toxic, expensive, unstable and/or which generate undesired side&#8208;products upon consumption. To circumvent this, the in&#8208;situ generation of gaseous fluorophosgene from triphosgene, its conversion by fluoride into the OCF 3 anion and the direct use of the latter in nucleophilic substitutions is an appealing strategy, which, although it has been approached recently, has not been fully exploited. We disclose herein our efforts towards this aim.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimeric Indenofluorene&#8208;Extended Tetrathiafulvalene Motif for Enhanced Intramolecular Complexation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) is a redox&#8208;active compound, which reversibly undergoes two one&#8208;electron oxidations to give stable species. Several features of TTF, such as redox and optical properties as well as geometry and self&#8208;associating nature, can be tuned by extension of the conjugated system with an aromatic linker such as an indenofluorene (IF) moiety. In this work we present the synthesis of a novel dimeric scaffold of IF&#8208;extended TTF (IF&#8208;TTF) in which the units are linked by a rigid 1,4&#8208;bis(2&#8208;ethynylphenyl)buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyne moiety.  1  H&#8208;NMR spectroscopic studies reveal that the scaffold is very prone to form intramolecular IF&#8208;TTF dimer complexes even in the neutral form, and stable radical cation species were formed in solution upon chemical oxidation with tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)ammoniumyl hexachloroantimonate (&#8216;  magic blue&#8217;  ). Electrocrystallization of the rigid scaffold yielded a semi&#8208;conducting material which proved to be stable to ambient temperature and air.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various 1&#8208;(1&#8208;hydroxyalkyl) paraconyl alcohols are important signaling molecules within antibiotics production in Streptomyces sp. Intending developing a flexible convergent chemical synthesis of such butanolides, a zwitterionic aza&#8208;Claisen rearrangement was chosen as reliable strategy generating the central stereotriad. Reaction of enantiopure  N  &#8208;allyl pyrrolidines and 4&#8208;phenylbutenoic acid fluoride delivered defined configured amides displaying the 2,3,1&#8217; stereotriads. The configuration was determined by the allyl alcohol moiety indicating a complete remote stereo control. Amide removal via iodolactonization and proceeding reductions, halocyclization and elimination gave key alkylidene tetrahydrofuran derivatives. Stepwise degradation of the olefins via ozonolysis, reductive work&#8208;up and protecting group removal delivered both enantiomers of the target Streptomyces coelicolor butanolide 5.</dc:description>

Stepwise degradation of the olefins via ozonolysis, reductive work-up and protecting group removal delivered both enantiomers of the target Streptomyces coelicolor butanolide 5.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalysed Carboborylation for the Synthesis of Borylated Indanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interception of &#963;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;palladium complexes in catalysis is a powerful strategy for the generation of molecular complexity. We have demonstrated a palladium&#8208;catalysed carboborylation reaction for the synthesis of borylated indanes, which proceeds in good yields and moderate enantioselectivity.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalysed carboborylation reaction for the synthesis of borylated indanes has been investigated. This reaction proceeds in good yields with an achiral catalyst, and is tolerant of substitution on the aryl ring, although sensitivity to the substitution of the alkene was observed. Initial studies towards an enantioselective version of this reaction were undertaken, identifying phosphoramidites as a promising ligand class. This allowed for the synthesis of chiral indane and indolone products with moderate levels of enantioselectivity.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The appearance of propargyl radicals as synthetic intermediates has increased in recent years from a structural curiosity to a frequent occurrence. This minireview covers the synthetically relevant organic chemistry involving the intermediacy of propargyl radicals. The review is organized by the process employed in radical generation, including H&#8208;atom abstraction, propargyl&#8208;X homolyses, radical addition to enynes, reduction of polar C=X bonds, reductions of stable carbocations, and metal&#8208;mediated coupling reactions. The relevant mechanisms of generation and reaction are discussed, as are applications in syntheses of target molecules of interest.</dc:description>

         <title>Combining organocatalyzed aldolization and reductive amination: an efficient reaction sequence for the synthesis of iminosugars</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past two decades, organocatalytic aldol reaction emerged as a powerful method for the enantioselective carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation, often offering more efficient, economical and environmentally friendly synthesis of chiral molecules. On the other hand, reductive amination is one of the most important reactions in synthesis of biologically active compounds and drug candidates. Coupling these two reactions results in a powerful tactical combination that allows for a rapid, stereoselective access to substituted, highly functionalized five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered  N  &#8208;heterocycles. This minireview illustrates the applicability of this approach as the key feature in syntheses of various iminosugars &#8211; a class of polyhydroxylated alkaloids with a range of interesting biological activities and high pharmacological potential.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When aiming to build molecules with elevated molecular complexity starting from relatively simple starting materials, photochemical transformations represent an open avenue to circumvent analogous multistep procedures. &#160;Specifically, light&#8208;mediated cycloadditions remain as powerful tools to generate new bonds begotten from non&#8208;very intuitive disconnections, that alternative thermal protocols would not offer. In response to the current trend in both industrial and academic research pointing towards green and sustainable processes, several strategies that meet these requirements are currently available in the literature. &#160;This Minireview summarizes [2+2] and [4+2] photocycloadditions that do not require the use of metal photocatalysts by means of alternative strategies.

         <dc:description>Sequential acylation/silylation of nitroalkanes leads to  O  &#8209;silylated &#945;&#8208;acyloxyoximes in high yields. First step of reaction involves deprotonation of nitrocompound with sodium hydride promoted by DBU or alcohol/15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 system followed by treatment with acyl chloride.  In situ  generated acyl nitronate is further silylated by silyl triflate that triggers hetero&#8208;Claisen [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement within  N  &#8208;acyloxyenamine moiety furnishing orthogonally protected oxime derivatives. The procedure has large substrate scope for both nitroalkanes and acylating agents (acyl chlorides, chloroformates) and allows tuning of reaction conditions depending on the particular type of substrate. Application of obtained oxime derivatives in organic synthesis is demonstrated.</dc:description>

This minireview describes the applications of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) and chiral deep eutectic solvents (CDESs) in asymmetric organocatalyzed carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions.







Abstract
The recent advances in asymmetric organocatalysis using eutectic mixtures as a reaction medium are revised in this mini&#8208;review. In addition, the first enantioselective transformations using chiral eutectic solvents, which play the role of a green medium and organocatalyst, are described. In this minireview we intend to deepen not only in the synthetic aspects of asymmetric organocatalysis in eutectic mixtures, but also in the fundamental issues that seem to be essential for a successful development of this promising, and at the same time challenging, methodology.

         <title>Catalysis in Supramolecular Systems: the Case of Gel Phases</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular gels are a fascinating class of materials, originated by the self&#8208;assembly of low molecular weight molecules. Underpinned by non&#8208;covalent interactions, they find application in a diverse range of fields. Among these, supramolecular gels can be considered as organized, non&#8208;conventional reaction media, able to influence reactivity in a radically different way, compared with what happens in solution. This short review will be focused on this aspect, covering literature from 2010 onwards, addressing the application of supramolecular gels as reaction media. In particular, in the first section we explore organocatalytic reactions in gel phase, with wide synthetic relevance, such as aldol and Mannich reactions as well as Friedel Crafts or ester hydrolysis processes. Subsequently, focus is laid on metal&#8208;catalysed reactions, among which relevance is given to widely used reactions like cross&#8208;coupling and click reactions. Then, the final sections cover the use of supramolecular gels as reaction media for photo&#8208; and biocatalysed processes.</dc:description>

         <title>The Development of Organocatalytic Asymmetric Reduction of Carbonyls and Imines Using Silicon Hydrides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric reduction of prochiral ketones and ketimines represents one of the most important and practical chemical transformations toward the synthesis of valuable chiral alcohols and amines. Among the existing strategies, organocatalyzed asymmetric reduction of carbonyls and imines using silicon hydrides is attractive due to low&#8208;cost, chemical stability, and easy handling in experiments. In this review, we wish to highlight the recent progress made in the past fifteen years in this field. Four catalytic systems of different activation modes are presented and discussed in detail. We aim to help shed light on common features that enable highly enantioselective silicon hydride reductions via organocatalysis and provide the design principles for the development of more effective catalytic systems .</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed formal cycloaddition between thienopyridine/thienopyrazine carboxylic acids and alkynes, triggered by C&#8208;H activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the last decade, a number of metal&#8208;catalyzed technologies for the functionalization of C&#8208;H bonds in carbonaceous aromatic substrates have been developed. However, similar reactions with aza&#8208;heteroaromatic precursors are more challenging and have been much less developed. Herein we report for the first time catalytic formal cycloadditions of  N,S  &#8208;heterocycles featuring carboxylic acid substituents, with unsaturated partners (alkynes). The reaction, which works with different symmetrical and unsymmetrical alkynes, produces appealing tricyclic &#593;&#8208;pyrones in a straightforward manner. The optimized conditions established for a model reaction employing thieno[2,3&#8208;  b  ]pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid as substrate, involved the use of Ag  2  CO  3  /AgSbF  6  as additives, and proved to be general for different alkynes. Moreover, analogous cycloadditions using thieno[3,2&#8208;  b  ]pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid and thieno[2,3&#8208;  b  ]pyrazine&#8208;6&#8208;carboxylic acid were successfully developed. Overall, this catalytic technology allows to build, in a single step, an interesting variety of pharmaceutically relevant tricyclic &#593;&#8208;pyrones exhibiting nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper Catalyzed Protosilylation/Protoborylation of gem&#8208;Difluoroallenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;catalyzed highly regioselective protosilylation and protoborylation of gem&#8208;difluoroallenes to afford tertiary and secondary gem&#8208;difluoroallyl compounds have been developed. The reactions proceed under very mild reaction conditions and provided the corresponding products in high efficiency.







Abstract
We have developed a protocol for protoborylation and protosilylation of gem&#8208;difluoroallenes to afford gem&#8208;difluoroallyl&#8208;boronates and gem&#8208;difluoroallylsilanes. It is different from non&#8208;fluorine allenes in which nucleophiles are added to &#947;&#8208;position of gem&#8208;difluoroallenes to afford &#946;,&#947;&#8208;addition products. Not only monosubstituted gem&#8208;difluoroallenes but also disubstituted gem&#8208;difluoroallenes could react well with silaboronate (PhMe2Si&#8722;Bpin) and bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2). The protocol is simple and efficient to construct compounds which contain tertiary/secondary gem&#8208;difluoroallylboronates and gem&#8208;difluoroallylsilanes. Moreover, diverse organofluorine compounds can be converted from these organoboronates and silanes.

         <title>Study of Rhodamine&#8208;Based Fluorescent Probes for Organic Radical Intermediates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodamine&#8208;based amide derivatives were used as fluorescent probes in the detection and real&#8208;time monitoring of radical intermediates in different solvents. Mechanism studies reveal a reversible opening and closing of the spirolactam ring with the presence or absence of radicals.







Abstract
Rhodamine&#8208;based amide derivatives for the detection of radical intermediates in organic reactions were synthesized and used as fluorescent probes over a wide range of solvents. The mechanistic studies confirm a reversible opening and closing of the spirolactam ring. Compound 21 can be used to support the radical mechanism or in the real&#8208;time monitoring of radical intermediates.

         <title>The use of Potassium/Sodium Nitrite as a Nitrosating Agent&#160;in the Electrooxidative N&#8208;nitrosation of Secondary Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein on the electrochemical N&#8208;nitrosation of secondary amines using widely available sodium/potassium nitrite as nitrosating agents. This approach not only eliminates the need for using a combination of sodium/potassium and strong acid but also has good functional group tolerance. The reaction is compatible with the late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceutical compounds and could be conducted in gram scale with high reaction efficiency. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the N&#8208;nitrosation occurs via the anodic oxidation of KNO  2  into an NO  2  radical which is then transformed into an NO  +  cation.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Organic Synthesis Using Light&#8208;Mediated N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of dual catalytic systems mediated by light is on the rise. In particular, light&#8208;mediated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis has recently experienced an exponential growth. This minireview gives an overview on the activation modes and synthetic opportunities that the combination of photoredox/NHC catalysis has to offer and discuss other approaches that do not require the use of an external photocatalyst.







Abstract
The combination of photocatalysis with other ground state catalytic systems have attracted much attention recently due to the enormous synthetic potential offered by a dual activation mode. The use of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) as organocatalysts emerged as an important synthetic tool. Its ability to harness umpolung reactivity by the formation of the Breslow intermediate has been employed in the synthesis of thousands of biologically important compounds. However, the available coupling partners are relatively restricted, and its combination with other catalytic systems might improve its synthetic versatility. Thus, merging photoredox and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis has emerged recently as a powerful strategy to develop new transformations and give access to a whole new branch of synthetic possibilities. This review compiles the NHC catalyzed methods mediated by light, either in the presence or absence of an external photocatalyst, that have been described so far, and aims to give an accurate overview of the potential of this activation mode.

         <title>Synthesis, Stability, and Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions of Methyl 2&#8208;Oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;based methyl vinyl glycolate (MVG) has been oxidized to methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate with the Dess&#8208;Martin periodinane. Densely functionalized methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate is stable at low temperatures but slowly dimerizes by a hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction at room temperature. Accordingly, methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate has been developed as a new dienophile in the classical Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with 1,3&#8208;dienes







Abstract
Methyl vinyl glycolate (MVG, methyl 2&#8208;hydroxybut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate) is a new biobased platform chemical, which is available by degradation of carbohydrates. In the present work, the oxidation of MVG to methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate has been investigated and a procedure developed with the Dess&#8208;Martin periodinane. Methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate has not been characterized before and is stable for days at &#8722;18&#8201;&#176;C, but slowly dimerizes by an unusual hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction at room temperature. Therefore, the reactivity of methyl 2&#8208;oxobut&#8208;3&#8208;enoate in the normal Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with 1,3&#8208;dienes has been investigated and a one&#8208;pot procedure developed where MVG is first oxidized with the Dess&#8208;Martin periodinane followed by the addition of the 1,3&#8208;diene. A number of different 1,3&#8208;dienes can take part in the cycloaddition to afford the functionalized cyclohexene products in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields.

         <dc:description>An approach to a series of new 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles is described. Synthesis of the title compounds relied on a two&#8208;step sequence including heterocyclization of 2&#8208;amido&#8208;3,3&#8208;dichloroacrylo&#173;nitriles with aliphatic secondary amines (dimethylamine, morpholine), primary aliphatic amines with active functional groups (2&#8208;aminoethanol and glycine ethyl ester), and aniline. An efficient and straightforward protocol introduces a carboxylate group at the C&#8208;2 position of 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles, connected to the heterocycle directly or through an aliphatic linker. This carboxylic group is an attractive motif that can be found in a variety of drug&#8208;relevant compounds and also used for further modifications. Furthermore, efficient transformations of selected trisubstituted compounds were used to demonstrate their rich synthetic potential &#8211; e.g., as precursors to 2&#8208;(4&#8208;cyano&#8208;5&#8208;(dimethylamino)oxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetamides, oxazole&#8208;containing macrocyclic structures, 2&#8208;(oxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetami&#173;des, amino pyrazoles, 3&#8208;(4&#8208;cyano&#8208;5&#8208;aminoxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)coumarins, and oxazole amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical and Enzymatic Approaches to Esters of sn&#8208;Glycero&#8208;3&#8208;Phosphoric Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Esters of sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoric acid (GPAE) are highly polar, water&#8208;soluble molecules endowed with important biological and pharmacological activities. Methods for GPAE manufacturing are based either on enzymatic deacylation of glycerophospholipids contained in lecithin or on a multi&#8208;step total synthesis from commercially available building blocks. Current manufacturing routes to GPAE and their complex biological functions are reviewed herein.







Abstract
Esters of sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoric acid (GPAE) are derivatives of glycerophospholipids in which both the fatty acid chains in sn&#8208;1 and sn&#8208;2 positions are removed. Phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidylserine (PS) are the most abundant glycerophospholipids in Nature. Their deacylated derivatives find application in many industrial sectors; for example, sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine (GPC) is useful as a cognitive enhancer and as a food ingredient, whereas sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoinositol (GPI) acts as a natural anti&#8208;inflammatory agent. This minireview covers the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of chemical and biocatalytic methods for the obtainment of these lipid&#8208;derived components.

         <title>Strigolactones: Phytohormones with Promising Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strigolactones (SLs) are carotenoid&#8208;derived plant hormones. Their effects on plant metabolism and the elucidation of their mode of action on plant cells inspired applications in biomedical fields. In this Minireview, the state of the art of using SLs as anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory, or antiviral bioactive compounds is reported.







Abstract
Strigolactones are a class of carotenoid&#8208;derived plant hormones, which impact many functions of plant metabolism in response to environmental stress. They also act as exogenous signals perceived by both mycorrhizal fungi and parasitic plants. The peculiar chemical skeleton of these molecules and their mode of action in plants inspired possible applications in biomedical fields. In this minireview, an overview of the most recent applications of Strigolactones and analog derivatives as anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and antiviral drugs is described.

         <title>Brown allylation: application to the synthesis of natural products</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric allylation represents an important reaction applied in the natural product synthesis. The stereoselective introduction of an allyl group allows to obtain versatile chiral building blocks, which may further undergo various transformations due to the presence of the carbon&#8208;carbon double bond. In this review, we address the Brown allylation, which involves the conversion of aldehydes into homoallylic alcohols using B&#8208;allyldiisopinocampheylborane as a chiral reagent. We provide a comprehensive overview of the reaction and highlight its application in the synthesis of natural products, while assessing its performance in comparison to other approaches. The total of 17 syntheses have been described, including the synthesis of biologically active macrolides Disciformycin B, Biselyngbyolide B, Peloruside A and Gliomasolide A, bis&#8208;piperidine alkaloid (&#8211;)&#8208;Anaferine and Dysoxylactam A.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of 5&#8208;(Alkynyl)dibenzothiophenium Salts: Synthesis of Diynes, Vinyl Sulfones, and Phenanthrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthetic potential of 5&#8208;(alkynyl)benzothiophenium salts is further evaluated. In addition to their reactivity as electrophilic alkynylation reagents, they undergo regioselective additions to the C&#8722;C triple bond. The products thus obtained can be used for the synthesis of Z&#8208;vinyl sulfones and 9,10&#8208;substituted phenanthrenes.







Abstract
The reactivity of 5&#8208;(alkynyl)dibenzothiophenium salts 1 is explored in the presence of different nucleophiles, dienes, and under photochemical conditions. Reaction with lithium acetylides affords diynes in moderate yields; while depending on the substitution pattern, the reaction with sulfinates delivers either the alkyne transfer products, alkynyl sulfones, or &#946;&#8208;(sulfonium) vinyl sulfones through addition to the C&#8722;C triple bond. Similar behavior is observed when tosylamines are used as nucleophiles. Salts of general formula 1 also react with dienes to render the corresponding Diels&#8208;Alder cycloadducts. The vinyl sulfonium salts obtained by these routes further react with nucleophiles through a Michael addition, dibenzothiophene elimination sequence. Alternatively, they also engage in photoinduced radical cyclizations to produce substituted phenanthrenes. Attempts to use this specific addition/radical cyclization sequence for the construction of the 6a,7&#8208;dehydroaporphine skeleton present in several families of alkaloids are also described.

         <title>Peptide Head&#8208;to&#8208;Tail Cyclization: A &#8220;Molecular Claw&#8221; Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic peptides are in high demand for a wide range of therapeutic applications. Among the simplest yet challenging cyclizations is the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail fashion via the C&#8208; and N&#8208;termini, as most current peptide syntheses use C&#8208;terminal protecting supports. Herein, we demonstrate that a soluble&#8208;tag&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis in combination with a backbone amide linker strategy is applicable to the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclization.







Abstract
Both naturally occurring and artificial cyclic peptides are in high demand for a wide range of therapeutic applications due to the improvement of their enzymatic stability, cell permeability, and pharmacological activity compared to their linear counterparts. Among the simplest yet challenging cyclizations is the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail fashion, where linear peptides are cyclized via C&#8208; and N&#8208;termini, since most current peptide synthesis has been dominated by the use of C&#8208;terminal protecting supports. Herein, we demonstrate that a soluble&#8208;tag&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis in combination with a backbone amide linker strategy is applicable to the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclization. The use of an amide &#8220;N&#8208;tag&#8221; instead of the general terminal C&#8208;tag enables an effective head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclization on&#8208;support. The key for successful cyclization is a tagging position that enables the center of the peptide to be grabbed.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Sonogashira Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions of gem&#8208;Dibromovinyl BODIPY Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BODIPY derivatives bearing gem&#8208;dibromovinyl moieties (&#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;positions of the pyrrole rings, directly or through phenyl spacers) undergo efficiently Sonogashira and Stille Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling resulting in the formation of 1,1&#8208;diynyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkene and 1,1&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkene products. A pronounced red shift of absorption maxima occurs when substituents are at the &#945;&#8208;position rather than the &#946;&#8208;position of the pyrrole ring. Spectroscopic properties of &#945;&#8208;substituted 1,1&#8208;diynyl&#8208;p&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkenes are sensitive to protonation resulting in remarkable pH&#8208;responsive changes in the absorption and fluorescence emission spectra.

The structures of the resulting 1,1&#8208;diynyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkene and 1,1&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkene products were assigned using MS, NMR and in some cases X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. 1,1&#8208;Diynyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkene BODIPYs exhibit red shifted absorption maxima, particularly when substituents were introduced at the &#945;&#8208;position rather than the &#946;&#8208;position of the pyrrole ring. Aromatic compounds showed larger red shifts as compared to the aliphatic substituted analogs. The highest red shifts were observed with compounds featuring electron donating substituents.

         <title>Exploiting the Versatility of Palladium Catalysis: A Modern Toolbox for Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Celebrating the tenth year of the prestigious Nobel prize in 2010 for palladium chemistry; still, palladium stands strong over other transition metals for its versatility. Cascade reactions in contemporary organic synthesis reduced cost and time through careful design. This review outlines Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions in organic synthesis from the post&#8208;Nobel era.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization received much attention in organic synthesis due to its efficiency and rapid transformation of simple starting materials into complex molecular skeletons. Celebrating the 10th year of the prestigious Nobel prize for palladium chemistry, we witness it still proceeds strong over other transition metals for its versatility. Cascade reactions in contemporary organic synthesis reduced cost and time through careful design. It has emerged as the first choice, a powerful tool for multiple bond formations in one step with a wide range of functional group tolerance due to the deep understanding of various pathways. A variety of compounds with biological relevance with complex molecular scaffolds have been achieved using these cascade coupling reactions. This review outlines Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions from the post&#8208;Nobel era. Nevertheless, more discoveries and endless possibilities for new transformations are underway.

         <title>Para&#8208;Functionalization of N&#8208;Substituted 4&#8208;amino[2.2]paracyclophanes by Regioselective Formylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective formylation of N&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;amino[2.2]paracyclophanes is described, which allows an easy access to key synthetic intermediates which are useful for the preparation of a large variety of para di&#8208;substituted paracyclophanes in a straightforward manner.







Abstract
Herein, we report a simple and convenient procedure to prepare para&#8208;disubstituted [2.2]paracyclophanes in a straightforward manner. Our approach relies on a regioselective formylation of N&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;amino[2.2]paracyclophanes, which allows an easy access to a series of products incorporating a reactive aldehyde function para to the electron&#8208;donating group. These compounds can be engaged in a variety of orthogonal late&#8208;stage derivatization processes involving either the carbonyl group or the amine function, and can serve as precursors to rapidly access more complex paracyclophane derivatives. Control of planar chirality is also possible by performing a kinetic resolution of key racemic intermediates through asymmetric transfer hydrogenation. The formylation can be run on a synthetically useful scale, thus confirming the practical applicability of our method.

         <title>2&#8217;&#8208;Derivatisation of 3&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;Methyl Pyrimidine Nucleosides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study of nucleoside and nucleotide analogs has been the subject of extensive development during these last decades. In this field, additions or substitutions on the sugar residue had led to potent drugs in antiviral and anticancer chemotherapies. Herein, we reported the stereoselective synthesis of a new series of pyrimidine nucleosides bearing a double modification in the 2&#8217; and 3&#8217; positions of the sugar scaffold.







Abstract
The stereoselective synthesis of some 3&#8217;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;3&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;methyl pyrimidine nucleosides is reported. The studied modifications concern the inversion of the configuration in 2&#8217;&#8208;position as well as the introduction of fluoro and azido substituents. The corresponding arabinonucleoside and 2&#8217;&#8208;substituted ribonucleoside analogs of uracil and cytosine have been obtained and fully characterized. Attempts to introduce fluoro and azido substituents with inversion at C&#8208;2&#8217; are also presented.

         <title>Maleic Acid/Thiourea&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative ipso&#8208;Friedel&#8211;Crafts Reaction of Indoles to Produce Functionalized Spiroindolenines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergic effect of Br&#248;nsted acid and hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysis enabled a dearomative ipso&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts (DIFC) reaction of indoles with diazoamides. Pharmaceutically valuable spiroindolenines with various functionalities were chemoselectively synthesized under metal&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
A dearomative spirocyclization of diazo&#8208;functionalized indoles was developed under metal&#8208;free conditions. Although the spiroindolenine architecture with a tertiary alkyl substituent at the 2&#8208;position is a privileged scaffold of bioactive molecules, a general synthetic strategy has remained elusive. In this study, a dual catalyst system comprising maleic acid and Schreiner's thiourea was used to construct a spiroindolenine core that was inaccessible by rhodium or silver catalysis. Computational studies revealed a unique macrocyclic transition state consisting of the substrate, maleic acid, and thiourea cocatalyst, which lowered the activation energy of spirocyclization through multipoint mutual interactions.

A combination of different enzymatic activities and chemical protocols were exploited to access the two enantiomers of Wieland&#8208;Miescher ketone and three of its four alcohols derivatives as enantioenriched species. Specifically, the optimization of biotransformations of WM&#8208;ketone or of substrates (bio)chemically&#8208;prepared from it, mediated by hydroxysteroids dehydrogenases, short chain alcohol dehydrogenases and lipases, are described.







Abstract
Biocatalytic approaches have been investigated in order to isolate the enantiomers of Wieland&#8211;Miescher ketone (1) and of its alcoholic derivatives (cis&#8208;2 and trans&#8208;3). Specifically, two enzymes from our in&#8208;house metagenomic collection of oxidoreductases, IS2&#8208;SDR and Dm7&#945;&#8208;HSDH, catalyzed the kinetic resolution of the starting racemic ketone 1 or its complete conversion into two diastereomeric products, respectively. Moreover, the kinetic resolution of the racemic cis&#8208;alcohol (2) was very efficiently obtained (E&#8773;2.000) by lipase PS catalyzed acetylation in dry acetone. All the products were isolated with ee&#8805;95&#8201;%. Simple chemical elaborations of some of them allowed to isolate the missing enantiomers.

COF&#8208;JLU25, a COF&#8208;based photocatalyst comprised solely of electron&#8208;donating units, 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene (PyTA) and 4&#8208;[4&#8208;(4&#8208;formylmethyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl] benzaldehyde (TpDA), demonstrated excellent photocatalytic activity with high efficiency, robust reusability, and low catalyst loading when used in catalyzing the oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organic reactions are environmentally friendly green chemical transformations among which photosynthetic oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids to phenols has attracted increasing research interest during the very recent years. Given the efficiency and reusability of heterogeneous catalysts, COF&#8208;JLU25, an electron&#8208;rich COF&#8208;based photocatalyst constructed by integrating electron&#8208;donating blocks 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene (PyTA) and 4&#8208;[4&#8208;(4&#8208;formylmethyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl] benzaldehyde (TpDA), was selected as a photocatalyst for the oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids. In our studies, COF&#8208;JLU25 demonstrated excellent photocatalytic activity with high efficiency, robust reusability, and low catalyst loading, showcasing an application potential of previously underexplored COF&#8208;based photocatalyst composed solely of electron&#8208;rich units.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis, Structure and Properties of a Novel Class of Axially Chiral N&#8208;Aryl Quinolinium Salt</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterobiaryls containing a quaternized nitrogen within a chiral N&#8722;C axis occur in Nature and have been the target of several total syntheses. Here we reveal a general methodology towards enantio&#8208;enriched N&#8208;arylquinolinium salts, obtained via a four&#8208;step route from commercially available precursors and with axial stereochemistry controlled through an enantioselective ring&#8208;closing Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig coupling reaction.







Abstract
Inspired by naturally occurring molecules containing atropisomeric N+&#8208;C axes, we have developed a novel synthetic approach to generate a library of axially chiral N&#8208;aryl quinolinium salts. Enantiopurities up to 93&#8201;% ee were obtained via a four&#8208;step route from commercially available precursors. Axial stereochemistry was controlled through an enantioselective ring&#8208;closing Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig coupling reaction. The structure and properties of the salts were examined by X&#8208;ray crystallography, DFT, UV&#8208;Vis, and fluorescence spectroscopy, revealing high rotational barriers and solvatochromic behaviour.

         <title>Monoprotected Diamines Derived from 1,5&#8208;Disubstituted (Aza)spiro[2.3]hexane Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted (aza)spiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. Structural characterization of the obtained spirocyclic compounds provided a rationale for their applications in design of saturated ring isosteres and peptidomimetics.







Abstract
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted spiro[2.3]hexane and 5&#8208;azaspiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. In both cases, the method relied on the cyclopropanation of the corresponding cyclobutane or azetidine derivatives. In the case of monoprotected 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexanes, the title products were obtained as single diastereomers. X&#8208;Ray diffraction studies supported by exit vector plot (EVP) analysis showed that the obtained building blocks are promising piperidine/cycloalkane isosteres with potential utility to drug discovery. Also, conformations observed in the crystalline state for the two different diastereomers of 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexane derivatives prompt their application in design of &#946;&#8208;turn and sheet&#8208;like peptidomimetics, respectively.

         <title>Last of the gem&#8208;Difluorocycloalkanes 2: Synthesis of Fluorinated Cycloheptane Building Blocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isomeric gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane derivatives were obtained in two to six synthetic steps from readily available starting materials. The developed synthetic approaches were shown to be efficient for a multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of target compounds and involved six&#8208;membered ring homologation and/or deoxofluorination reactions as the key steps.







Abstract
The gem&#8208;difluorocycloalkane family was extended to all possible regioisomers of the gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane, monofunctionalized by carboxilic&#8208;, amino&#8208; or keto&#8208; group, that were synthesized on a multigram scale. The preparation of the corresponding building blocks was achieved from readily accessible starting materials either via six&#8208;membered ring homologation or deoxofluorination of the appropriate seven&#8208;membered cyclic ketones.

         <title>Reaction of N,N&#8208;Disubstituted Polyfluoroalkanethioamides with Diazomethane: Entry to New Thiirane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4&#8208;dioxane derivatives are discussed.






New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between N,N&#8208;disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

     alt="Reaction of N,N-Disubstituted Polyfluoroalkanethioamides with Diazomethane: Entry to New Thiirane Derivatives"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1-polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4-dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4-dioxane derivatives are discussed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between &lt;i&gt;N,N&lt;/i&gt;-disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1-polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4-dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4-dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X-ray diffraction analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

  Multigram synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates relying on efficient 4&#8211;5&#8208;step reaction sequences is described. The title compounds was obtained in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield).
  
  
  
  
 
 
  An approach to the synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates on a multigram scale was developed. Two synthetic strategies were evaluated: the first based on the lithiation&#8211;borylation of the corresponding 2&#8208;bromoallyl derivatives, and the other relying on regioselective hydroboration of the appropriate hetera&#8208;substituted enynes. The second method appeared to be more efficient in terms of scalability and substrate scope. Further steps included ring closing&#8208;metathesis, mild palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation with diazomethane, and reaction with KHF2 and furnished the title compounds in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield, 4&#8211;5 steps).

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;Sultams by One&#8208;Pot Reductive Cyclization of Cyanoalkylsulfonyl Fluorides</title>

         <dc:description>
  A multigram synthesis of spirocyclic &#947;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;sultams is reported, which are advanced building blocks for organic synthesis and drug discovery. The synthesis proceeds through a one&#8208;pot reductive cyclization of cyclic cyano sulfonyl fluorides.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  One&#8208;pot intramolecular cyclization of novel sp3&#8208;enriched cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluorides into spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;sultams is disclosed. The method relies on nitrile group reduction followed by sulfonylation of amino group thus formed upon mild conditions (NaBH4, NiCl2&#183;6H2O in MeOH). Cyclization proceeds smoothly with considerable efficiency (48&#8211;84&#8201;%, 10 examples) on up to 30 g scale. The cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluoride intermediates can be obtained via S&#8208;nucleophilic substitution in &#946;&#8208;functionalized alkanenitriles or double alkylation of &#945;&#8208;alkylthioacetonitrile, followed by oxidative chlorination with Cl2 and further reaction with KHF2. The title mono&#8208; and bifunctional sultams are advanced sp3&#8208;enriched building blocks for drug discovery and organic synthesis providing novel substitution patterns and frameworks mimicking saturated nitrogen heterocycles such as pyrrolidine/pyrrolidone.
