         <title>Electroreductive Intramolecular Heck&#8208;Type Cyclization for the Synthesis of Benzofused Oxygenated Heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional synthetic routes to benzofused oxygenated heterocycles, such as Dihydrobenzofuran, chromane and isochromane derivatives, often involve complex synthetic conditions, high costs, and environmental concerns. The key to addressing this challenge lies in achieving transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C(sp&#178;)&#8211;I bond cleavage to enable intramolecular radical cyclization. Inspired by electroreductive strategies, we developed a convenient, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free electroreductive tandem reaction for synthesizing dihydrobenzofuran, chromane, and isochromane derivatives. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach not only simplifies synthetic conditions but also suppresses competing hydrogenation and halogenation pathways at the exocyclic carbon radical center.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved Chemical Synthesis of Avenanthramides Family and its Analogs by Mixed Anhydride Method</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amides derived from common hydroxycinnamic acids &#8212; including 4&#8208;hydroxycinnamic acid, 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxycinnamic acid, 3,4&#8208;dihydroxycinnamic acid, 3,4&#8208;dimethoxycinnamic acid, and 3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxycinnamic acid &#8212; along with various free aminobenzoic acids, such as 5&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;aminobenzoic acid, a key component of the avenanthramide family, have been rapidly synthesized using an innovative, environmentally friendly synthetic methodology. This approach, grounded in traditional chemistry, utilizes mixed anhydrides to simultaneously protect and activate hydroxycinnamic acids through the actions of triethylamine and isobutyl chloroformate while employing acetone as a green solvent. The resulting amides, formed from the coupling with free aromatic amino acids, are constructed as O&#8208;carbonate&#8208;protected derivatives with high yields and purity, isolated directly via crystallization, thus eliminating chromatographic or HPLC purifications. Furthermore, free phenols can be conveniently released on demand using morpholine in methanol. Under these conditions, C&#8208;protected aromatic amino acids remain unacylated. This synthetic strategy represents a significant advancement over conventional acyl chloride methodologies, which often rely on toxic reagents and solvents and entail time&#8208;consuming and complex procedures. It enhances the production of important phytochemicals such as Avenanthramides and opens doors to various analogs, paving the way for potential pharmacological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Bis(Phosphine) Monoxides and N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Phosphine Oxides through Michaelis&#8211;Arbuzov Reactions of Phosphinite Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Michaelis&#8211;Arbuzov reaction of dihaloalkanes with methyl dialkylphosphinite esters provides a modular approach to bis(phosphine) monoxide ligands with different substituents on the two phosphorus centers. The intermediate haloalkylphosphine oxide reacts with N&#8208;arylimidazoles to give phosphine oxide&#8208;substituted N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand precursors.

A modular synthesis of bis(phosphine) monoxide (BPMO) ligands has been realized using the Michaelis&#8211;Arbuzov reaction of dialkylphosphinite esters. The modular synthetic method allows the chemoselective synthesis of BPMO ligands in which the substituents on the two phosphorus centers are different. This methodology also provides a route to N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphine oxide ligand precursors.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Mediated Cascade Synthesis of Open&#8208;Cage Fullerenes from C60 and Propargylic Carbonates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, open&#8208;cage fullerenes (i.e., fullerene derivatives featuring an orifice within their cage structure) have attracted significant attention across multiple research areas in materials, coordination, supramolecular, and biomolecular chemistry. However, the methodology available for the preparation of open&#8208;cage fullerenes remains limited. In this study, it was discovered that upon heating fullerene C60 with propargylic carbonates in the presence of silver trifluoroacetate, a cascade of reaction steps was initiated, resulting in the one&#8208;step synthesis of the corresponding open&#8208;cage bisfulleroids. Moreover, the feasibility of introducing various substituents via this methodology was confirmed. Notably, the proposed protocol facilitates the synthesis of bisfulleroid derivatives, wherein a hydrogen atom resides on one side of the bridgehead carbon at the orifice, while an aryl or alkyl substituent is strategically introduced on the opposite side. This approach provides structural diversity for the synthesis of open&#8208;cage fullerenes, and is expected to promote the widespread application of open&#8208;cage fullerene derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>SnCl2&#8208;Catalyzed Phosphorylation of Alcohols and Selective Phosphorylation/Phosphinoylation of Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphorylated molecules, particularly phosphorylated carbohydrates, have garnered significant interest due to their distinct biological activities, driving an urgent demand for efficient phosphorylation strategies. In this study, we demonstrate the successful development of a SnCl2&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the phosphorylation of alcohols and carbohydrates. Notably, the reaction efficiency was found to be critically dependent on the addition order of SnCl2 and N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine, a phenomenon systematically investigated through mechanistic studies. A one&#8208;pot sequential ketalization/phosphorylation strategy was established for polyol substrates, enabling streamlined access to phosphorylated derivatives. The versatility of this approach was further exemplified by achieving selective phosphorylation/phosphinoylation of carbohydrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral &#946;&#8208;Lactams by Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#63743;H Carbene Insertion</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#63743;H carbene insertion leads to the enantioselective formation of chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams in up to 82% isolated yield and excellent enantioselectivities up to 98% enantiomeric excess without any indication of a competing Buchner reaction. The reaction is catalyzed by a new ruthenium complex containing a chiral pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(oxazoline) ligand in combination with a cyclometalated phenylimidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine ligand.

A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular carbenoid insertion into a C(sp3)&#63743;H bond leads to the enantioselective formation of chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams. The reaction is catalyzed by a ruthenium complex featuring a chiral pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(oxazoline) ligand, combined with a cyclometalated phenylimidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine ligand. This complex belongs to a recently introduced new class of ruthenium catalysts (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2020, 59, 12393). Starting from N&#8208;benzyl &#945;&#8208;diazoacetamides, chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams are provided in up to 82% isolated yield with up to 98% enantiomeric excess, without any occurrence of a Buchner side reaction. Mechanistic experiments reveal that &#946;&#8208;lactam (4&#8208;membered ring) formation is inherently favored over the more common &#947;&#8208;lactam (5&#8208;membered ring) formation.

         <title>Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;dimethyl Carboxylic Esters via Asymmetric Barbier Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the occurrence of the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;dimethyl carboxylic ester motif in many natural products no attempt was made to synthesize this core structure via a racemic and enantioselective Barbier reaction. In this study, the optimized reaction conditions for the achiral Barbier reaction between allyl bromide and a 2,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxopropanoate were found, yielding the desired &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;dimethyl carboxylic ester in up to 64%. Therefore, different metals, additives, solvents and solvent mixtures were tested. The optimized reaction conditions were then used to expand the substrate scope of the Barbier reaction by using five structurally different allylic and propargylic bromides. By using (+)&#8208;cinchonine and (&#8211;)&#8208;cinchonidine as chiral additives along with indium in a THF&#160;/&#160;hexane solvent mixture it was possible to obtain ten different &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;dimethyl carboxylic esters in an enantioenriched fashion with up to 81% yield and 98%ee.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Syntheses of the Linearly&#8208;Fused Prenylated Indole Alkaloids Asperversiamides H and M via Oxidative Rearrangement of the Putative Biosynthetic Precursor Dihydrocarneamide A</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An improved synthesis of the alkaloid dihydrocarneamide A is reported and this has been subjected to a biomimetic&#8208;type oxidative rearrangement using an oxaziridine and so affording the spiro&#8208;oxidole&#8208;containing and prenylated indole alkaloids (PIAs) asperversiamides H and M. This work serves to confirm the structure assigned to the latter. Oxidation of dihydrocarneamide A using m&#8208;chloroperbenzoic (m&#8208;CPBA) afforded an oxidative fragmentation product representing the linear isomer of the PIA amoenamide A and thus a potential "natural product in&#8208;waiting". Furthermore, oxaziridine&#8208;mediated oxidation of the epimer of dihydrocarneamide A (and the enantiomer of the structure assigned to the natural product asperversiamide F) afforded a mixture of two hitherto unreported spiro&#8208;oxindoles. Given the manner in which these last two products have been formed it seems likely that these, too, are "natural products in&#8208;waiting". Certain cytotoxic and anti&#8208;microbial properties of key compounds are reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Cyclization of 1,7&#8208;Dienes Induced by &#945;&#8208;Oxyalkyl/Acyl Radicals to Access Functionalized Benzo[b]azepin&#8208;2&#8208;ones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free cascade oxidative cyclization method has been developed for synthesizing functionalized benzo[b]azepin2&#8208;ones from 1,7&#8208;dienes using alcohols, ethers, or aryl aldehydes. The reaction generates &#945;&#8208;oxyalkyl or acyl radicals by direct C(sp3)&#8722;H or C(sp2)&#8722;H cleavage, avoiding photocatalysts and transition metals. This approach offers a mild strategy for the synthesis of benzo[b]azepine derivatives with high atom economy and efficiency. Mechanistic studies, including radical trapping and HRMS analysis, confirmed a radical&#8208;mediated pathway involving cyclization and single&#8208;electron transfer.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The trifluoromethylthiolated group (SCF3) is characterized by its strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability, excellent lipophilicity, good stability, and bioavailability, making it highly relevant for applications in drug design and development. This review summarizes recent advances in C&#8722;X (H, Cl, OTf, B(OH)2) trifluoromethylthiolation reaction from 2014 to 2024. The discussion is organized into three major sections: 1) transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H trifluoromethylthiolation reactions facilitated by directing groups (DGs), 2) transition metal&#8208;catalyzed trifluoromethylthiolation via cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and 3) light&#8208;assisted transition metal&#8208;catalyzed trifluoromethylthiolation reactions. Additionally, this review examines the substrate scope, limitations, and partial mechanisms associated with these transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven E&#8208;Selective Semihydrogenation of Alkynes and Their Application in the Treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light&#8208;driven E&#8208;selective semihydrogenation scheme of alkyne compounds is developed for designing and synthesizing glioblastoma multiforme inhibitors. The representative reaction mechanism is decoded through theoretical calculations and deuteration experiments.

A visible light&#8208;driven E&#8208;selective semihydrogenation scheme of alkyne compounds is developed for designing and synthesizing glioblastoma multiforme inhibitors. Herein, room&#8208;temperature semihydrogenation reactions of various alkyne compounds are successfully achieved under the irradiation of white light. The representative reaction mechanism is decoded through theoretical calculations and deuteration experiments, revealing the critical roles played by [Ir(Cp&#8208;Me5)Cl2]2, PdCl2, DPPE and TEOA as photosensitizer, catalyst, ligand, and electron donor, respectively. This method exhibits excellent E&#8208;selectivity and broad functional group compatibility and demonstrates its practical value by producing pinosylvin and its derivatives with strong inhibitory effects on U87 cells.

The representative reaction mechanism is decoded through theoretical calculations and deuteration experiments, revealing the critical roles played by [Ir(Cp-Me&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, PdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, DPPE and TEOA as photosensitizer, catalyst, ligand, and electron donor, respectively. This method exhibits excellent &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity and broad functional group compatibility and demonstrates its practical value by producing pinosylvin and its derivatives with strong inhibitory effects on U87 cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A total enantioselective synthesis of Ectocarpin A, an oxylipin identified through the first hydroperoxide bicyclase activity of CYP5164A3 in brown algae, has been successfully completed in 12 steps starting from tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;cyclopentafuranone. Key transformations include the creation of the chiral tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;cyclopentafuranone, a diastereoselective epoxidation, an enzymatic desymmetrization of a 1,4&#8208;diol, an epimerization, and both Wittig and Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefinations to build the carbon framework of Ectocarpin A.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Anion&#8208;Binding&#8208;Catalyzed Nucleophilic Addition to 4&#8208;Quinolones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral quinolones and their derivatives are predominant synthetic building blocks and pharmacological agents. Nevertheless, their synthesis mostly relies on transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective 1,4&#8208;additions of organometallic reagents such as Grignard, organozinc or organoboron species for alkylation, arylation and alkynylation reactions. Herein, we report the first organocatalytic enantioselective formal 1,4&#8208;addition to challenging 4&#8208;quinolones upon in situ silylation to the corresponding quinolinium ions, followed by asymmetric nucleophilic attack to this type of substrates. This method complements previous metal catalyzed approaches by enrolling enol nucleophiles and relies on anion&#8208;binding catalysis using a chiral triazole&#8208;based anion binder. The enantioenriched 2&#8208;substituted 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4&#8208;quinolones were thus obtained in good yields (up to 97% yield) and enantioselectivities up to 89:11 e.r. Finally, the easy access to 4&#8208;amino and &#947;&#8722;amino alcohol derivatives by post functionalization, as well as to enantiopure compounds (&gt;99:1 e.r.) was showcased. The notable feature of this protocol includes its mild reaction conditions, avoiding the use of transition metals, broad functional group tolerance and potential application towards the synthesis chiral 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4&#8208;quinolones and tetrahydroquinolines as important skeletons of bioactive and natural products.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Alkoxyphthalimides represent a versatile class of redox&#8208;active alcohol derivatives for the formation of new carbon&#8211;carbon bonds. Herein, key precedents using N&#8208;alkoxyphthalimides for new carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation under photochemical reaction conditions are first presented. The merger of single&#8208;electron activation strategies with Ni&#8208;catalysis in select cross&#8208;electrophile couplings is then highlighted. Concluding thoughts for future reaction design are also presented.

N&#8208;alkoxyphthalimides represent a versatile class of redox&#8208;active alcohol derivatives for carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation following activation by single&#8208;electron reduction. Herein, key precedents using N&#8208;alkoxyphthalimides for the formation of new carbon&#8211;carbon bonds under photochemical reaction conditions are first presented.

         <title>Chemical and Biosynthetic Evolution of Quadrane and Related Sesquiterpenoids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 14, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the evolution of biosynthetic enzymes, the bioactivity&#8208;relevant chemical space of natural products has been significantly expanded. In this concept, we summarize the recent progress in elucidating the intriguing chemical and biosynthetic evolution of fungal&#8208;derived quadrane sesquiterpene scaffolds including humulene, caryophyllene, presilphiperfolan&#8208;8&#8208;ol, silphinene, and terrecyclene, offering opportunities to discover novel sesquiterpenoids through genome mining.







Abstract
Natural products, with their potent bioactivities and selectivities, significantly benefit human health and agriculture. The evolution of biosynthetic enzymes of natural products has greatly expanded their chemical space relevant to bioactivity. Insights from natural evolution provide valuable guidance for engineering these enzymes to create molecules with novel structures and bioactivities. Recent studies have unveiled an intriguing biosynthetic evolution of fungal&#8208;derived quadrane sesquiterpene scaffolds, indicating evolutionary relationships among sesquiterpene scaffolds such as humulene, caryophyllene, presilphiperfolan&#8208;8&#8208;ol, silphinene, and terrecyclene, rooted in their biosynthetic mechanisms. This review summarizes recent progress in the discovery and biosynthetic characterization of these sesquiterpenoids. These findings illuminate the logic behind the chemical and biosynthetic evolution of sesquiterpenes and offer opportunities to discover new sesquiterpenoids through genome mining.

         <title>Effect of Substituents on the Tautomerism of Pyridone Nucleoside Analogs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 14, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and quantum&#8208;chemical work shows that the predominant tautomer of 6&#8208;fluoropyridones is the lactim, not the lactam form. This makes them analogs of cytosine, not uracil or thymine in the context of incorporation opposite complementary bases of genetic sequences.







Abstract
Nucleobase analogs are important tools in medicine and chemical biology, as they offer molecular targeting options for the intervention in genetic processes. Pyridone C&#8208;nucleosides have been shown to pair with adenine in complementary strands, but a switch from the lactam to lactim form may change their base pairing preference. We synthesized 6&#8208;fluoropyridone analogs of aciclovir and cidofovir, which we assumed to be in the lactam form, but were found to lack activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV). Spectroscopic data then indicated that they are predominantly in the lactim form, with a hydrogen bonding pattern suitable for G. The tautomerism of fluoropyridones was then studied by UV&#8208;spectroscopy and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The UV spectroscopic pattern for either tautomer was corroborated by synthesizing N&#8208; and O&#8208;methylated model compounds, and measuring their spectra. The tautomeric equilibrium of selected other substituted pyridones is predicted, based on density&#8208;functional theory calculations.

The tautomeric equilibrium of selected other substituted pyridones is predicted, based on density-functional theory calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A New Approach Towards the Synthesis of Imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;Ones Using &#945;&#8208;Diazoesters and Hydrazide Catalysed by Cu(I) Salt</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 14, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthetic strategy for the preparation of imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;ones from hydrazides and &#945;&#8208;diazoesters using Cu(I) metal catalyst is reported. In the absence of the Cu(I) catalyst or even utilising any other metal catalyst, the unexpected imine bond formation between the terminal nitrogen of hydrazide and carbene carbon was observed. The reaction proceeds via the cleavage of the C&#8722;N bond of the hydrazide.







Abstract
Imidazole and substituted imidazoles have drawn much attention owing to their superior biological functions. In this regard, devising a synthetic strategy to improve viability, easy to handle and more yield is challenging task for synthetic chemists. Herein we report a new synthetic strategy for the synthesis of imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;ones from hydrazides and &#945;&#8208;diazoesters using Cu(I) metal catalyst. In the absence of the Cu(I) catalyst or even utilizing any other metal catalyst, the imine bond formation between the terminal N of hydrazides and carbene was observed. The reaction proceeds via the cleavage of the C&#8722;N bond of the hydrazide followed by cyclization and yielded the expected product. We have also explored the substrate scope of our strategy and obtained excellent yields. We have isolated the products in pure form and fully characterized them using sophisticated analytical and spectroscopic techniques including single crystal X&#8208;Ray analysis.

         <title>An Approach to Functionalization of Cucurbit[n]uril Through a Tetrahydrothiopheno Equatorial Substituent</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 14, April 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inclusion of a tetrahydrothiopheno equatorial substituent on a glycoluril moiety of a cucurbit[n]uril provides an avenue to reactive derivatization. This process extends the potential for future applications of the cucurbituril homologues 7 and 8. Also highlighted are new glycoluril derivatives that may serve as precursors in the synthesis of cucurbit[n]uril or their analogues.







Abstract
A tetrahydrothiopheno equatorial substituent on a glycoluril moiety of a cucurbit[n]uril was found to be robust and provided a capacity for reactive derivatization. We have demonstrated this on tetrahydrothiopheno substituted glycoluril derivatives as a proof of concept, then translatable reactions were applied to tetrahydrothiopheno substituted cucurbituril homologues 7 and 8. In addition to the successful derivatization tetrahydrothiophenocucurbit[7 and 8]uril, some new glycoluril derivatives have been synthesized, which may serve as future precursors for the synthesis of other substituted cucurbit[n]uril and their analogues.

Abstract
An efficient organocatalytic asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation/N&#8208;hemiacetalization reaction of 2&#8208;aminoindoles with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes was developed. By incorporating an amino group at the C2 position of indole, the nucleophilicity of the C3 position of indole and the amino group were leveraged to generate an enamine&#8208;type ternary synthon. This approach enabled the construction of a range of chiral tetrahydro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;carboline skeletons with potential biological activity, delivering moderate to excellent yields (46&#8211;83&#8201;%) and achieving outstanding enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee).

         <dc:description>
Co complexes (Salen Co&#8208;NHPI) with Salen, organic nitrogen hydroxyl groups efficiently catalyze the one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component synthesis of benzimidazoles from nitrobenzene, benzyl alcohol, and sulfonyl azide.







Abstract
Multicomponent reactions are an efficient toolbox of access to complex compounds, but the development of multicomponent reactions involved in benzimidazole synthesis is still limited. Herein, a one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component reaction involving nitrobenzene, benzyl alcohol, and sulfonyl azide was developed for the synthesis of benzimidazoles employing Co&#8208;complexes (Salen Co&#8208;NHPI) as catalyst, which by self&#8208;assembly from salen ligands, organic nitrogen hydroxyl compounds, and CoCl2. Compared with previously reported three&#8208;component methods for the construction of benzimidazoles, this method involves a novel hydrogen borrowing/cyclization and can provide a variety of benzimidazole in moderate to excellent yields.

&lt;p&gt;Co complexes (&lt;b&gt;Salen Co-NHPI&lt;/b&gt;) with Salen, organic nitrogen hydroxyl groups efficiently catalyze the one-pot, three-component synthesis of benzimidazoles from nitrobenzene, benzyl alcohol, and sulfonyl azide.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multicomponent reactions are an efficient toolbox of access to complex compounds, but the development of multicomponent reactions involved in benzimidazole synthesis is still limited. Herein, a one-pot, three-component reaction involving nitrobenzene, benzyl alcohol, and sulfonyl azide was developed for the synthesis of benzimidazoles employing Co-complexes (&lt;b&gt;Salen Co-NHPI&lt;/b&gt;) as catalyst, which by self-assembly from salen ligands, organic nitrogen hydroxyl compounds, and CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Compared with previously reported three-component methods for the construction of benzimidazoles, this method involves a novel hydrogen borrowing/cyclization and can provide a variety of benzimidazole in moderate to excellent yields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The Cover Feature shows the synthesis of imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;ones from &#945;&#8208;diazoesters and hydrazides, catalyzed by a CuI catalyst. The two boats symbolize the reaction pathway, each carrying the same two passengers: &#945;&#8208;diazoester and hydrazide. In the absence of a catalyst, the journey leads to the formation of an imine. However, under the influence of &#8220;clouds&#8221;, representing the CuI catalyst, the reaction takes a different course, resulting in the formation of imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;ones.

Deprotection and Functionalization of Protective N&#8208;Heterocycles Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild protocol for the deprotection and further functionalization of N&#8208;heterocycles in a single operation is discovered in the presence of potassium trimethylsilanolate and butyronitrile. A variety of N&#8208;heterocycles containing various protecting groups can be compatible with good yields and functional group tolerance under ambient conditions.

         <title>Nonenzymatic Carboxylate Phosphorylation in Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phosphorylation of carboxylic acids to acyl phosphates is a recurring reaction in the core of microbial metabolism, a set of processes thought to date back to the origins of life. This study shows that carboxylate phosphorylation occurs in water without enzymes or adenosine triphosphate (ATP), enabled by diamidophosphate and nitrite.

The core pathways of autotrophic microbial metabolism have been proposed to be fossils of self&#8208;organized prebiotic chemistry. In recent years, numerous reactions within these pathways have been shown to occur nonenzymatically, supporting this hypothesis. However, the phosphorylation of carboxylic acids to the corresponding acyl phosphates, a recurring metabolic reaction, has notably yet to be demonstrated without enzymes. Here, this study shows that carboxylate phosphorylation is promoted by diamidophosphate and sodium nitrite in the presence of water, driven by the release of dinitrogen. The reaction occurs in minutes at 0&#8211;50&#8201;&#176;C to convert carboxylic acids to acyl amidophosphate intermediates, which then undergo nitrite&#8208;promoted hydrolysis to give the corresponding acyl phosphates. The partial overlap in scope with important metabolic carboxylates and the concentrated acidic conditions likely limit its direct applicability in metabolic origins of life scenarios. Nonetheless, the work represents a step forward in understanding nonenzymatic carboxylate phosphorylation and helps clarify how the transformation might eventually be rendered compatible with a protometabolism.

Divergent One&#8208;Pot Two&#8208;Step Synthesis of Phosphoryl&#8208;Substituted 4&#8208;Quinolones and 3&#8208;Indolinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New methodology is being developed for the divergent synthesis of phosphonylated 4&#8208;quinolones and phosphonylated 3&#8208;indolinones based on phosphoryl&#8208;substituted ynones bearing (2&#8208;iodoaryl) group using controlled addition of anilines to them followed by Cu&#8208;catalyzed cyclization.

Herein, an approach is developed for the selective two&#8208;step synthesis of phosphoryl&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;quinolones and phosphoryl&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;indolinones. This is achieved through the reaction of (3&#8208;(2&#8208;iodoaryl)&#8208;3&#8208;oxoprop&#8208;1&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phosphonates with anilines followed by Cu&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization of the intermediately formed regioisomeric enamines, which are selectively formed under neat conditions or in the presence of a gold complex as a catalyst. This method allows for the synthesis of a series of phosphoryl&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;quinolones and phosphoryl&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;indolinones in good yields.

         <title>Unlocking Indazole Synthesis from &#945;&#8208;Diazo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Ketoesters via Aryne Trapping: A Streamlined Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the growing demand to develop, beyond laboratory scale, more efficient, safer and ecofriendly, as well as scalable mechanochemical transformations, the direct synthesis of 1&#8208;acyl&#8208;1H&#8208;indazoles via &#945;&#8208;diazo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters aryne trapping is reported. The results reveal the unexpected formation of N&#8208;aryl&#8208;1H&#8208;indazoles and aryl benzoates, likely facilitated by a thia&#8208;fries rearrangement. Density functional theory calculations elucidate the cycloaddition pathway and rationalize the formation of the various reaction products.

Indazoles are high&#8208;value chemical building blocks used in medicinal chemistry and materials science for their distinct structural and functional features. This study details a [3&#8201;+&#8201;2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction between various aryl&#8208;ketodiazoesters and ortho&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)aryl triflates under mild conditions, leading predominantly to 1&#8208;acyl&#8208;1H&#8208;indazoles. N&#8208;aryl&#8208;1H&#8208;indazoles and aryl benzoates are also observed as other products. The reaction exhibits broad functional group tolerance and scalability, making it a valuable synthetic approach. Mechanistic insights, derived from control experiments and density functional theory calculations, elucidate the cycloaddition pathway and rationalize the formation of the products. Collectively, these findings underscore the method's potential for synthesizing complex indazole derivatives, which hold significant promises for applications in pharmaceutical development and advanced materials research.

         <title>Recent Advances in Radical Hydrofunctionalization of Alkenes and Dienes via Reductive Metal&#8208;Hydride Hydrogen Atom Transfer (MHAT)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reductive metal&#8208;hydride hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) strategy has opened new avenues in organic synthesis. By leveraging the reductive generation of metal hydride species, particularly Co(III)&#8208;H, this approach facilitates the addition of hydrogen and various functional groups to alkenes under milder conditions.

The metal&#8208;hydride hydrogen atom transfer strategy (MHAT) has emerged as a robust approach for the radical hydrofunctionalization of alkenes, demonstrating exceptional functional group tolerance and chemoselectivity. Traditional methods for generating metal&#8208;hydride (M&#8208;H) species typically require oxidative conditions that depend on stoichiometric oxidants and hydride donors, posing challenges to sustainability and scalability. In contrast, the reductive MHAT strategy, which forms M&#8208;H species through the transfer of a proton and an electron, offers a more concise and sustainable pathway for radical alkene hydrofunctionalization. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the key advances in reductive MHAT catalysis, highlighting recent innovations and discussing potential future directions for the field.

&lt;p&gt;The reductive metal-hydride hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) strategy has opened new avenues in organic synthesis. By leveraging the reductive generation of metal hydride species, particularly Co(III)-H, this approach facilitates the addition of hydrogen and various functional groups to alkenes under milder conditions. Crucially, it avoids the need for stoichiometric amounts of oxidants and hydride donors, allowing for a wide range of transformations.

&lt;p&gt;The metal-hydride hydrogen atom transfer strategy (MHAT) has emerged as a robust approach for the radical hydrofunctionalization of alkenes, demonstrating exceptional functional group tolerance and chemoselectivity. Traditional methods for generating metal-hydride (M-H) species typically require oxidative conditions that depend on stoichiometric oxidants and hydride donors, posing challenges to sustainability and scalability. In contrast, the reductive MHAT strategy, which forms M-H species through the transfer of a proton and an electron, offers a more concise and sustainable pathway for radical alkene hydrofunctionalization. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the key advances in reductive MHAT catalysis, highlighting recent innovations and discussing potential future directions for the field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Monomers with Spirocyclic Acetal Units for Synthesis of Sustainable and Recyclable Polymers with Improved Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent progress on the molecular design and synthesis of functional monomers with spirocyclic acetal structures, particularly bio&#8208;based ones, is highlighted and their use for preparation of high&#8208;Tg polymers is discussed. The impact of the spirocyclic acetal structures on the properties and possibilities for chemical recycling of the resulting polymers are briefly summarized

Multi&#8208;functional molecules with spirocyclic acetal structures are emerging as attractive monomers to prepare high&#8208;performance polymers designed to be depolymerized and recycled under specific physicochemical conditions. Spirocyclic acetal structures are formed by condensation of a suitable aldehyde or ketone with a polyol so that the functionalities necessary for the polymerization are retained. In general, rigid spirocyclic acetal units can efficiently enhance the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the polymer. This typically increases, for example, the stiffness and use&#8208;temperature of the materials. Furthermore, the inherent sensitivity of spirocyclic acetal units to acidic conditions may be utilized to develop polymers that may be conveniently and selectively cleaved into, for example, monomers or oligomers under controlled acidic conditions. This opens up opportunities for producing new chemically recyclable polymers and plastics. Herein, the recent progress in molecular design and synthesis of functional monomers with spirocyclic acetal structures and their use for the design and preparation of chemically recyclable high&#8208;Tg polymers is highlighted. Monomers and polymers with the potential to be derived from sustainable bio&#8208;based resources are given special attention.

         <title>Latent Ruthenium Complexes Supported by Two N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligands: Synthesis and Catalytic Activity with Distinctive Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ruthenium complexes were synthesized and tested as latent olefin metathesis catalysts. Catalysts containing a diisopropylphenyl substituent on the NHC were thermally activated at relatively low temperatures compared to catalysts with mesitylene substituents. Complexes with mixed saturated/unsaturated NHCs excelled in high&#8208;temperature reactions with challenging substrates. UV&#8208;C light activation was successful with complexes with benzylidene ligands exclusively.

Novel bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene [NHC]) ruthenium complexes of the form (NHC1)(NHC2)Ru(=CRR')Cl2 (where NHC represents N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands and CRR&#8217; denotes Ph&#8208;indenylidene or benzylidene moieties) are prepared from second&#8208; and third&#8208;generation Grubbs catalysts. These complexes exhibit thermal latency in ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM), cross&#8208;metathesis (CM), and several ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) reactions. Upon UV&#8208;C (255&#8201;nm) irradiation, two complexes that contained benzylidene ligands prove to be highly effective for the ROMP of cyclooctadiene. The most active species incorporate IPr or SIPr as at least one NHC ligand, highlighting how bulky isopropyl substituents enhance NHC lability. Beyond their utility in UV&#8208;C&#8208;initiated ROMP, these complexes show promising activity for high&#8208;temperature CM and RCM of alkenyl&#8208;nitrile substrates.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of 5&#8208;Amino&#8208;4&#8208;Cyanoxazoles</title>

A mechanochemical protocol enables the rapid synthesis of 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles from 2&#8208;amido&#8208;3,3&#8208;dichloroacrylonitriles and aliphatic amines in the presence of dipotassium phosphate. The method achieves high yields within minutes under solvent&#8208;minimized conditions, offering improved sustainability for the construction of oxazole scaffolds.

A mechanochemical methodology for the preparation of 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles through the reaction of 2&#8208;amido&#8208;3,3&#8208;dichloroacrylonitriles with primary or secondary aliphatic amines (or their respective salts) in the presence of dipotassium phosphate is reported. The process is carried out by processing the mixture of starting materials in a mixer mill, with ethanol used as a liquid&#8208;assisted grinding additive. Dipotassium phosphate serves as a cost&#8208;efficient and non&#8208;toxic inorganic base, ensuring 100% carbon economy of the process. The reaction produces the corresponding oxazole products with up to 97% yield in just 10&#8201;min. However, preparative scope of the method is restricted to highly nucleophilic and sterically unobstructed primary and secondary aliphatic amines. Aromatic amines display low reactivity at room temperature. For instance, indoline achieves only 43% conversion to its oxazole product after 3&#8201;h.

         <title>Structural Determination and Characterization of Electronic Properties of Photosilylated Derivatives of C70</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photoreactions of C70&#160;and mesityl&#8208;substituted disilirane (disilacyclopropane)&#160;1a&#160;afforded the corresponding adducts&#160;2a&#160;and&#160;3a, the former of which was reported previously. The structures of&#160;2a&#160;and&#160;3a&#160;were unequivocally established respectively as a 1,4&#8208;adduct structure at the [d,d'] site and as a 1,2&#8208;adduct at the [a,b] bond,&#160;respectively,&#160;using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses. The latter structure represents the first example of crystallographic study of 1,3&#8208;disilolane (1,3&#8208;disilacyclopentane) derivatives of fullerenes.&#160;The electronic properties of these products are characterized based on&#160;electrochemical and theoretical studies elucidating the electron&#8208;donating effects of silyl groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved Total Synthesis of Millepachine through a Negishi Acylative Cross&#8208;Coupling Protocol</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chalcone Millepachine exhibits interesting biological properties, such as cytotoxic and antitumor activity against various cancer cells. Despite these characteristics the only published synthesis gives the product in modest yield. A study on the acylative Negishi cross&#8208;coupling for obtaining Millepachine in higher yield is presented. Both iodo&#8208; and bromo&#8208;2H&#8208;chromene derivatives, as precursors of the organozinc halides, were synthesized and different routes for obtaining the organometallic species were explored. The transmetalation from the aryllithium proved to be the most efficient method to obtain a reactive organozinc species for the Negishi cross&#8208; coupling with 4&#8208;methoxycynnamoil chloride. Up to 75% yield of pure product was obtained corresponding to 43% overall yield from commercially available 3&#8208;methoxyphenol.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactions of Halogermylenes with N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: Selective Formation of Low Valent Ge(II) Species</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of halogermylenes&#160;with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) to form halogermylene mono&#8208;NHC adducts and the germyliumylidene cation bis&#8208;NHC adducts is explored. Structural analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal their polarized covalent Ge&#63743;C bonds and dynamic NHC ligand exchange.

The reactions of the Rind&#8208;based 1,2&#8208;dihalodigermenes, (Eind)BrGe=GeBr(Eind) (1a), and (EMind)ClGe=GeCl(EMind) (1b), with two types of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) (Im&#8208;iPr2Me2 and Im&#8208;Me4) result in the formation of the halogermylene mono&#8208;NHC adducts, (Im&#8208;iPr2Me2)(Eind)GeBr (2a') and (Im&#8208;iPr2Me2)(EMind)GeCl (2b'), and the germyliumylidene cation bis&#8208;NHC adducts, [(Im&#8208;Me4)2(Eind)Ge]+[Br&#8722;] (3a) and [(Im&#8208;Me4)2(EMind)Ge]+[Cl&#8722;] (3b). The resulting Ge(II) species are stabilized by the bulky Rind groups and the strongly &#963;&#8208;donating NHC ligands, whose structures are confirmed by a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) analysis. Based on density functional theory (DFT) and quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM)&#160;calculations of 2a&#8217; and the cationic part of 3a, it is concluded that while the Ge&#63743;C(Eind) and Ge&#63743;C(NHC) bonds exhibit distinct differences in their degrees of polarization, all the Ge&#63743;C bonds display a partially polarized covalent character. Both reaction energy calculations and experimental studies suggested the potential liberation of an NHC ligand from the germyliumylidene cation bis&#8208;NHC adducts, leading to the exchange of the NHC ligands. The formation mechanism of 3a from 1a and two NHC molecules via (Im&#8208;Me4)(Eind)GeBr (2a) is discussed based on DFT calculations.

         <title>Earth&#8208;Abundant Metal Complexes as Catalysts for the Dehydrogenative Coupling of Hydrosilanes and Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept article examines the potential of Earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysts in the dehydrogenative coupling of hydrosilanes and alcohols, a key transformation for sustainable organosilicon synthesis and a promising method for hydrogen production. Recent advancements, mechanistic insights, and the implications of using them as viable alternatives to platinum group metals are discussed, including transition to greener and more cost&#8208;effective catalytic processes.

The dehydrogenative coupling of hydrosilanes with alcohols or water is a fundamental transformation in organosilicon chemistry, enabling the synthesis of alkoxysilanes, silanols, and siloxanes&#8212;key materials for coatings and adhesives. Traditionally, these reactions have relied on catalysts based on platinum group metals, which are costly and scarce. The development of Earth&#8208;abundant metal (EAM) catalysts offers a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective alternative. This concept article highlights recent advancements in homogeneous EAM catalysis for these transformations, focusing on mechanistic insights, reactivity trends, and catalytic efficiencies. Catalysts based on manganese, iron, cobalt, copper, or zinc are reshaping the field by offering efficient and selective processes for the synthesis of alkoxysilanes, silanols, and siloxanes. Moreover, a key feature of these catalytic systems is their ability to generate dihydrogen as a byproduct, offering potential applications in hydrogen storage and utilization. Despite the good performances of EAM catalysts in the hydrolysis or alcoholysis of silanes, challenges remain, including improving turnover numbers, substrate scope, and catalyst stability. Future developments integrating computational and experimental approaches will be key to optimizing these systems.

&lt;p&gt;This concept article examines the potential of Earth-abundant metal catalysts in the dehydrogenative coupling of hydrosilanes and alcohols, a key transformation for sustainable organosilicon synthesis and a promising method for hydrogen production. Recent advancements, mechanistic insights, and the implications of using them as viable alternatives to platinum group metals are discussed, including transition to greener and more cost-effective catalytic processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dehydrogenative coupling of hydrosilanes with alcohols or water is a fundamental transformation in organosilicon chemistry, enabling the synthesis of alkoxysilanes, silanols, and siloxanes&#8212;key materials for coatings and adhesives. Traditionally, these reactions have relied on catalysts based on platinum group metals, which are costly and scarce. The development of Earth-abundant metal (EAM) catalysts offers a sustainable and cost-effective alternative. This concept article highlights recent advancements in homogeneous EAM catalysis for these transformations, focusing on mechanistic insights, reactivity trends, and catalytic efficiencies. Catalysts based on manganese, iron, cobalt, copper, or zinc are reshaping the field by offering efficient and selective processes for the synthesis of alkoxysilanes, silanols, and siloxanes. Moreover, a key feature of these catalytic systems is their ability to generate dihydrogen as a byproduct, offering potential applications in hydrogen storage and utilization. Despite the good performances of EAM catalysts in the hydrolysis or alcoholysis of silanes, challenges remain, including improving turnover numbers, substrate scope, and catalyst stability. Future developments integrating computational and experimental approaches will be key to optimizing these systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a rhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed method for synthesizing &#946;&#8208;amino ketones from aryl cyclopropanes, utilizing water as an oxygen source and N&#8208;fluorobis(benzenesulfonamide) (NFSI) as a commercially available nitrogen source. This approach offers good substrate tolerance under mild conditions, providing a novel and practical route for &#946;&#8208;amino ketone synthesis. Mechanistic studies reveal a sequential cascade pathway initiated by single electron transfer (SET) facilitated by the rhodium(II) catalyst, followed by hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and radical polar crossover (RPC) steps. These insights underscore the potential of rhodium(II) in driving radical amination reactions, enhancing the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino ketones from simple precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation of Prenylated Pterocarpans from Synthetically Derived Demethylmedicarpin by Regioselective Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Hydroarylation and Related Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three prenylated pterocarpans including erybraedin A and erybraedin C have been synthesised from (&#177;)&#8208;demethylmedicarpin, itself prepared in four simple steps starting from resorcinol and 2,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenylacetic acid. A gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed and two&#8208;fold intramolecular hydroarylation (IMHA) reaction of a readily&#8208;derived bis&#8208;propargyl ether of (&#177;)&#8208;demethylmedicarpin proceeds with remarkable regio&#8208;selectivity to afford the racemate of a recently reported but yet&#8208;to&#8208;be named bis&#8208;2H&#8208;chromene&#8208;annulated pterocarpan&#8208;containing natural product. A possible explanation for this potentially very useful selectivity is advanced.

         <dc:description>Transforming a prochiral substrate into two stereodivergent products using a single chiral catalyst remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report an NHC&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyclization of cyclohexadienone&#8208;tethered ynals, enabling the preparation of two stereodivergent products: 6,5&#8208;bicyclic and 6,5,5&#8208;tricyclic frameworks. The reaction proceeds through two distinct pathways: an allenolate&#8208;Michael addition/esterification sequence and an allenolate&#8208;Michael addition/intramolecular Dieckmann condensation process. This approach represents a novel and efficient strategy for transforming a prochiral substrate into two products in a stereodivergent manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Self&#8208;Assembly and Viscoelastic Behavior of Pyrene&#8208;Based Fluorescent Hydrogel: Designing Paper Sensors for Water&#8208;Soluble Explosives</title>

Self&#8208;assembly properties and viscoelastic behavior of pyrene&#8208;based fluorescent hydrogel has been developed for the detection of water&#8208;Soluble explosives and also paper strips designed for on&#8208;location analysis purpose







Abstract
Recently organic&#8208;doped polyethyleneimine based hydrogels have emerged as smart responsive materials for optical sensing applications. To this end, herein we have designed and synthesized a biocompatible fluorescent hydrogel based on polyethyleneimine (PEI), incorporating pyrene as the polyaromatic signaling moiety. The self&#8208;assembly properties of the composite materials were primarily influenced by the nature of the organic dopant, the degree of substitution, and the microenvironment. The presence of the polyaromatic scaffold, such as pyrene, not only affects the fluorescence properties of the molecules but also modulates the extent of cross&#8208;linking by controlling &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. The hydrogel formation was observed in a methanol&#8208;water (3&#8201;% v/v) mixture. Additionally, the pyrene&#8208;attached hydrogel demonstrated promising potential for the highly sensitive detection of trinitrophenol (TNP), a toxic, water&#8208;soluble explosive. Spectroscopic investigations revealed that the electrostatic interaction between the ammonium units of PYR&#8208;PEI and picrate anions in aqueous medium facilitated charge transfer from pyrene to the picrate anion, resulting in a fluorescence turn&#8208;off response. Along with fluorometric response, using rheological experiments we show that the viscoelastic behaviour of the polymer gels also varied significantly upon addition of TNP. To determine the viscoelastic parameters, a two&#8208;term Maxwell model was used to fit the angular frequency&#8208;dependent storage and loss moduli measurements. Additionally, hydrogel&#8208;coated, highly robust, and reusable paper strips were also developed for on&#8208;field detection of TNP.

Chromium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling of Geminal Difluoroalkenes with Aliphatic Halides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of geminal difluoroalkenes with alkyl halides is catalyzed by low&#8208;cost CrCl2 combining with dtbpy ligand. It provides a viable strategy to stereoselectively form alkylated Z&#8208;fluoroalkenes, achieving the compatibility to a wide range of functionalities such as iodide, bromide, chloride, cyano, amino, and ester.

Herein, an effective, mild, and practical approach to stereoselective cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of difluoroalkenes with alkyl halides by cost&#8208;effective chromium catalysis is reported. This reaction is promoted by inexpensive CrCl2 combining with bipyridine ligand and manganese as the reductant, enabling the achievement of the reductive coupling of geminal difluoroalkenes with primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl halides at ambient temperature. It provides a valuable and scalable approach to form tri&#8208;substituted Z&#8208;fluoroalkylalkenes with good compatibility with a range of important functional groups. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the coupling reaction is initiated by forming alkyl radical by addition to alkene and combining with Cr(II) or by coordination with Cr(II) and carbometallation of difluoroalkenes in giving (alkyl)Cr species, which converts to Z&#8208;alkylated fluoroalkene motifs in a stereoselective manner by elimination of &#946;&#8208;fluoride atoms.

         <title>Harnessing Electricity in Dehydrogenative Coupling: Transition Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of Quinoline Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Providing easy access to quinoline derivatives under room temperature, transition metal&#8208;free, and oxidant&#8208;free conditions using electricity as an oxidant through a dehydrogenative pathway. A wide range of functional groups are tolerated, giving the desired quinoline product in good yields.

An efficient strategy is demonstrated for the electrocatalytic synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl quinoline derivatives via an anodic dehydrogenation of 2&#8208;aminobenzyl alcohol molecules followed by condensation with carbonyl compounds at room temperature. The current protocol requires only electricity as the green oxidant, provides the desired products in good to excellent yield, and is compatible with a wide range of functional groups.

         <title>Nickel(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Homocoupling of Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic system for the homocoupling reactions of various terminal alkynes has been developed. This reaction is characterized by cheap and stable NiCl2 as catalyst, 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline as the ligand, air as the oxidant, mild reaction conditions, and excellent functional group compatibility, demonstrating great potential for practical applications in the construction of symmetric 1,3&#8208;diyne derivatives.

The homocoupling of terminal alkynes is a key approach for constructing 1,3&#8208;diynes, typically relying on copper&#8208;based bimetallic systems. Herein, a catalytic system is developed based on nickel chloride, using 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline as the ligand and air as the oxidant, which successfully enables the homocoupling reactions of various terminal alkynes. This reaction is characterized by cheap and stable NiCl2 as catalyst, mild reaction conditions, and excellent functional group compatibility, demonstrating great potential for practical applications.

         <title>Amphiphilic Fluoro&#8208;Functionalized Cellulosic Materials: Synthesis, Characterization, and Organic Dye Adsorption Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New amphiphilic fluoro&#8208;functionalized cellulosic materials are being yielded through nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Covalent attachment of fluorinated moiety into biopolymers is being&#160;assured with full characterization. Fluoro&#8208;functionalized materials are being incorporated in alginate beads to remove organic pollutants from wastewater. Functionalization is leading to a three&#8208; to eightfold increase in the dye&#8208;removal efficiency, the resulting functionalized&#8208;beads can be also easily recycled .

The growing interest toward biopolymers application in amphiphilic conditions prompts one to explore the preparation of fluorinated cellulosic materials. Cellulose (CE) and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) are functionalized with highly fluorinated pendants, through a nucleophilic aromatic substitution on 3&#8208;pentadecafluoroheptyl&#8208;5&#8208;pentafluorophenyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole (FOX) leading to the corresponding fluorinated biopolymers CE&#8208;FOX and CMC&#8208;FOX. Structural and thermal stability confirm covalent attachment of the fluorinated moiety onto the cellulosic skeleton and highlighted an interesting 2D texture of the CMC&#8208;FOX material. Hybrid and amphiphilic features of CE&#8208;FOX and CMC&#8208;FOX, are confirmed by water and oil contact angle measurements. Applications as adsorbent material for organic contaminants from an aqueous solution are tested by previously incorporating the functional biopolymer into sodium alginate (SA) hydrogel beads. Rhodamine B (RhB) is used as a model wastewater pollutant. Fluoro&#8208;functionalization led to a three&#8208; to eightfold increase in the dye&#8208;removal efficiency of the SA&#8208;incorporated biopolymer with respect to the corresponding non&#8208;fluorinated material (from 11% to 48% for SA/CE vs SA/CE&#8208;FOX beads and from 11% to 94% for SA/CMC vs SA/CMC&#8208;FOX beads). Recyclability tests show good residual performance of SA/CMC&#8208;FOX beads after seven desorption/reuse cycles opening the way to more sustainable adsorbing processes for the removal of emerging pollutants from contaminated water.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Vicinal Difunctionalization of Carboranes with Benzoxazoles, Indoles, and Anilines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the article, a Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction has been developed to incorporate benzoxazoles into m&#8208;carborane structures without preactivation using alkyllithium reagents. Subsequent regioselective iodination and the second cross couplings with various NH heterocycles and anilines yield the desired difunctionalized products. Challenging substrates such as heteroanilines and benzamide are also tolerated under the developed condition.

Icosahedral carboranes have a wide range of applications in medicinal chemistry, material science, and catalysis. Although various methods have been disclosed for functionalizing carborane structures, the methods to incorporate different types of heterocycles are still lacking. This limitation is likely due to the functional group incompatibility under previously reported reaction conditions. In this article, a streamlined protocol is presented to prepare a new class of vicinal difunctionalized carboranes containing benzoxazoles, NH heterocycles, and anilines. This method involves a direct cross&#8208;coupling between 9&#8208;bromo&#8208;m&#8208;carborane and benzoxazoles, thereby eliminating the necessity for preceding deprotonation of the acidic C2 proton present in benzoxazole. Subsequent regioselective iodination at the B(10) vertex of the carborane and the second cross&#8208;coupling reactions with diverse indoles and anilines result in the formation of the desired vicinal difunctionalized products.

         <dc:description>Bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes, synthesized by the cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;enynes, serve as key scaffolds in various natural products. Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;enynes is an efficient route to bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes. However, gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed 1,5&#8208;enyne synthesis, particularly with a terminal alkyne, has not yet been fully explored. This study presents a mild and general method for the gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed allylation and tandem allylation&#8211;cycloisomerization of stannylated propargyl acetates with allylsilanes, yielding 1,5&#8208;enynes with terminal alkyne moiety and bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes. The catalytic system ((4&#8208;MeOC6H4)3PAuCl/AgSbF6) enabled the efficient synthesis of 1,5&#8208;enynes with good to high yields and regioselectivities. In addition, gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed tandem allylation&#8211;cycloisomerization using (JohnPhos)Au(MeCN)SbF6 afforded bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes with high regiocontrol. Stannylated propargyl acetates proved crucial in enhancing selectivity for both product classes.</dc:description>

Bicyclic Compounds: An efficient approach to the multigram preparation of 1&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione &#8211; a valuable building block for drug discovery &#8211; was developed. The method included only four steps and allowed for the preparation of the key compound in 48&#8201;% overall yield on up to 30&#8197;g scale. It was used synthesize monoprotected bicyclic diamines and a series of bridged Thalidomide analogs.







Abstract
An efficient approach to the multigram synthesis of 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes is described. The method relied on the intramolecular imide formation in the properly 1,3&#8208;functionalized cyclobutane derivative. In turn, the latter compound was obtained via the diastereoselective Strecker reaction of readily accessible 3&#8208;oxocyclobutanecarboxylate. The resulting synthetic intermediate &#8211; 1&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione &#8211; was used to synthesize several monoprotected bicyclic diamines valuable as building blocks for medicinal chemistry, as well as a series of bridged analogs of Thalidomide, a known anticancer drug and a component of proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs).

         <title>Recent Advances in Transition Metal&#8208;Free Strategies for the Transformation of Amides into Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amides are fundamental functional groups in organic synthesis and play crucial roles in medicinal chemistry and material science. Traditionally, amide transformations have often relied on transition&#8208;metal catalysts; however, recent advances have demonstrated efficient transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free strategies for amide bond activation. This review provides a comprehensive overview of emerging methodologies that enable selective formation of C&#8211;N, C&#8211;C, C&#8211;O, C&#8211;H, and C&#8211;X bonds. Key developments that offer sustainable and practical alternatives to conventional approaches include borate&#8208; and boronic acid&#8208;mediated transamidations, phosphoric acid&#8208;promoted transformations, and radical&#8208;based strategies. Additionally, nucleophilic substitutions with carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen&#8208;based nucleophiles have expanded the synthetic utility of amides by yielding diverse carbonyl and heterocyclic compounds. Mechanistic insights into these transformations reveal the role of electronic and steric effects in amide reactivity. By categorizing these methodologies based on amide substrates and reaction pathways, this review aims to provide a valuable resource for researchers seeking efficient, metal&#8208;free strategies for amide bond manipulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Diazo compounds under visible light: Stereoselective synthesis of cyclic architectures</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diazo compounds are versatile and valuable reagents in organic synthesis. The reaction of diazo substrates under photochemical conditions find high selectivity compared to that under thermal conditions. In the presence of light, they can act as carbene precursors or radical sources depending upon the reaction conditions and catalysts used. Recent years have witnessed a great advancement in visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photochemistry of diazo compounds for asymmetric access to various cyclic compounds. In this review, we summarized recent advances (2020&#8208;2024) in stereoselective synthesis of cyclic scaffolds via visible&#8208;light irradiation of diazo compounds. This review is organized according to the ring size of the synthesized compounds, viz., three, four, five, six, seven and higher membered ring systems. With an emphasis of mechanistic insights and scope of the reactions, this review shades light on current trends in this emerging field.</dc:description>

Abstract
A novel method for the synthesis of quinoxalines from o&#8208;phenylenediamines and sulfoxonium ylides, mediated by DBU (1,8&#8208;Diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene), is presented. This method does not require metal catalysts or oxidants, making it economical and environmentally friendly, while exhibiting excellent functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies suggest that DBU facilitates the reaction through nucleophilic attack on sulfoxonium ylides. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and various cross&#8208;reactions further highlight the advantages of this strategy.

         <title>Synthesis of C2&#8208;Silylated Indoles and Indolines Enabled by Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Silylation of Indolines with Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot reaction of indolines and hydrosilanes is presented to access C2&#8208;silylated indoles. Additionally, a rare example of iridium&#8208;catalyzed direct C2&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8211;H silylation of indolines has also been established.

An efficient iridium&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot protocol is reported for the synthesis of C2&#8208;silylated indoles from indolines and hydrosilanes. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the transformation proceeds through a tandem dehydrogenation/C&#8211;H silylation pathway. Furthermore, an example of iridium&#8208;catalyzed direct C2&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8211;H silylation of indolines is also disclosed.

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Regio&#8208;selective Dual&#8208;Functionalization of Arenes: Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Functional Aromatics via Aromaticity Destruction&#8208;Reconstruction Process</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual functionalization of arenes via a dearomatization&#8208;functionalization&#8208;rearomatization strategy facilitates chemo&#8208; and regioselective functionalization on phenols or anilines. This strategy proceeds via 2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienones and 2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienimines intermediates and permits a wide range of functionalizations with various coupling partners, enabling rapid molecular diversification under sustainable and transition metal&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Dual functionalizations of arenes promise to remain a powerful and versatile strategy for the synthesis of complex molecules with diverse applications in various fields. Dearomatization&#8208;Functionalization&#8208;rearomatization strategy emerges as a versatile tool for chemo&#8208; and regioselective functionalization of arenes via 2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienone/2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienimines, which can be easily accessible from phenols or anilines. 2,5&#8208;Cyclohexadienones serve as an &#8220;aromatic to be&#8221; synthon with multiple electrophilic centres, providing an opportunity towards their functionalization. While mono&#8208;functionalization was widely explored and covered in literature, simultaneous dual functionalizations with two distinct coupling partners offer a powerful strategy for rapid molecular diversification around aromatic rings. Diverse functional groups/coupling partners have been introduced chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selectively. The synthetic processes adopted are generally sustainable and free from transition metals and exotic conditions. This review showcased the advancement in developing dual functionalizations of phenols/anilines for the site&#8208;selective synthesis of multi&#8208;functional arenes through an aromaticity&#8208;destruction&#8208;functionalization&#8208;construction strategy.

         <title>Advancements in the Synthesis of Oxadiazines, Mechanistic insights and Pathways</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the synthesis and mechanistic pathways of oxadiazines, highlighting their significance in organic synthesis, pharmaceuticals, and industry. Recent advancements in metal&#8208;catalyzed, organocatalytic, and green approaches are examined, along with key strategies such as cycloaddition and oxidative annulation, etc. Mechanistic insights into intermediates, transition states, and catalyst roles are discussed to refine synthetic pathways and enhance efficiency.







Abstract
Oxadiazine has the distinctive structure of a six&#8208;membered heterocyclic ring with two nitrogen and one oxygen atoms. This molecule has lately gained substantial attention due to its promising uses in several sectors, including medicines, agrochemicals, and material science. As a result, the synthesis of oxadiazine is extensively explored for its application in pharmaceuticals, pest control, and medical treatments due to its antibacterial, anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory and insecticidal effects. In this review, we provided a comprehensive overview of oxadiazine&#8216;s synthetic strategies and mechanistic aspects, prioritizing the various novel methods developed for synthesising oxadiazine. We demonstrated the synthesis of various oxadiazine derivatives such as 1,3,4&#8208;, 1,3,5&#8208;, 1,2,4&#8208;, 1,2,5&#8208;oxadiazines and the functionalization of this molecule to enhance their bioactivity. In this study, we discussed an overview of synthetic routes, such as cyclization reactions, cycloaddition reactions, catalyst&#8208;free and solvent&#8208;free reactions, triflate&#8208;catalyzed reactions, etc. We highlighted the challenges faced in the reported synthesis, suitable reaction conditions, substrate scope and applications.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transition metal&#8208;catalyzed direct C&#8722;S and C&#8722;Se bond formation from C&#8722;H bonds has emerged as an efficient synthetic strategy for constructing previously inaccessible organochalcogen compounds, opening a new gateway to late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutical&#8208;relevant molecules and organic functional materials. C&#8722;Y bonds (Y = S, Se, Te) also show outstanding strategic relevance as handles to access other valuable functional groups downstream in a synthetic route. Despite the significant progress, the chemo&#8208;, site&#8208;, and enantioselective C&#8722;S and C&#8722;Se bond formation from unactivated Csp3&#8722;H bonds is still challenging owing to its low polarity and inertness. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed direct conversion of unactivated Csp3&#8722;H to C&#8722;S and C&#8722;Se bonds in the last decade, looking to motivate the continuous discovery of innovative and efficient systems for these transformations.</dc:description>

An organocatalytic &#947;,&#947;&#8208;regioselective formal (1+5) cycloaddition of isoindolinone&#8208;derived propargylic alcohols with 2&#8208;indolylphenols was established, which afforded a series of indole&#8208;fused chromanes in overall good yields.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Three&#8208;Component Radical Strategy for the Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Amino Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated three&#8208;component radical reaction involving alcohols or alkanes and in&#8197;situ&#8208;formed imines. The imines, generated from aldehydes and amines, serve as key reactants, while the inexpensive and readily available sodium decatungstate (NaDT) is employed as a photocatalyst. This strategy enables the functionalization of industrially accessible alcohols or alkanes to synthesize &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols via an intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The reaction is operationally simple, exhibits high conversion efficiency, facilitates straightforward post&#8208;reaction processing, and demonstrates excellent atom and step economy.

The imines, generated from aldehydes and amines, serve as key reactants, while the inexpensive and readily available sodium decatungstate (NaDT) is employed as a photocatalyst. This strategy enables the functionalization of industrially accessible alcohols or alkanes to synthesize &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols via an intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The reaction is operationally simple, exhibits high conversion efficiency, facilitates straightforward post&#8208;reaction processing, and demonstrates excellent atom and step economy.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Markovnikov Hydration of Unactivated Terminal Alkenes Enabled by Reductive Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we describe a convenient and general method for the Markovnikov oxidation of unactivated olefins to alcohols and ketones using commercially available iron acetylacetonate (Fe(acac)3) as catalysts, and cheap phenylsilane PhSiH3 as reducing agent. All reactions proceed efficiently at room temperature with air as sole oxidant. The alcohols are formed smoothly in up to &gt;80&#8201;% isolated yield and with 100&#8201;% regioselectivity for secondary alcohols formation, while the corresponding ketones were observed as by&#8208;products.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a simple and convenient protocol for the Markovnikov oxidation of unactivated olefins to alcohols and ketones using readily available iron salt Fe(acac)3 as a catalyst, and phenylsilane PhSiH3 as reducing material. All reactions proceed efficiently at mild conditions with air as terminal oxidant. This transformation has been applied to a variety of substrates, and is distinguished by its simplicity, mild temperatures and broad scope. The alcohols are formed smoothly in up to &gt;80&#8201;% isolated yield and with 100&#8201;% regioselectivity for secondary alcohols formation, while the corresponding ketones were observed as by&#8208;products.

         <title>Cascade Reactions of Enone&#8208;Tethered Ketones and Aldehydes with Indoles: Substrate&#8208;Controlled Divergent Synthesis of Indenes and Indanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diversity&#8208;oriented one&#8208;pot synthesis of indenes and indanes has been realized under benign metal&#8208;free conditions. The Michael&#8211;Aldol cascade process involving reactions of enone&#8208;tethered ketones with indoles to readily access indenes is demonstrated in the presence of iodine as a catalyst. However, a reaction sequence that involves Michael&#8211;Aldol, and nucleophilic substitution gives indanes bearing indole moieties by employing enone&#8208;tethered aldehyde as a reaction partner with indoles.







Abstract
A cascade strategy involving the reactions of enone&#8208;tethered ketones with indoles for the synthesis of indenes is outlined in the presence of iodine as a catalyst. Halogen bonding between molecular iodine and enones activates substrates to undergo Michael addition with indoles, resulting in the formation of enolates. These enolates in&#8197;situ are transformed into indenes via an intramolecular aldol condensation. Enone&#8208;tethered aldehydes, however, react with two molecules of indoles to give indanes through a reaction sequence that involves chemoselective Michael addition followed by intramolecular aldol, and nucleophilic substitution. The substrate&#8208;controlled diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis has been realized to readily access indenes and indanes bearing indole moieties under benign metal&#8208;free conditions. The compatibility of these reactions has also been tested with a scale&#8208;up reaction for practical applications.

         <title>Synthesis and Fluorescence Properties of Oxazolo[5,4&#8208;b]quinolines: Exploring Structure&#8208;Property Relationships and Design Strategies for Tailored Photophysical Characteristics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis, absorption and fluorescence spectra, and quantum yields of a series of oxazolo[5,4&#8208;b]quinolines are reported. The oxazolo[5,4&#8208;b]quinolines were synthesized via a two&#8208;step process involving the reaction of 4&#8208;trifluoroacetylazlactones with various substituted anilines, followed by intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization and Robinson&#8208;Gabriel oxazole formation.







Abstract
A series of oxazolo[5,4&#8208;b]quinoline derivatives were synthesized via a two&#8208;step process involving the reaction of 4&#8208;trifluoroacetylazlactones with various substituted anilines, followed by intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization and Robinson&#8208;Gabriel oxazole formation. The systematic investigation of the photophysical properties of the synthesized compounds revealed that the position and nature of the substituents on the oxazolo[5,4&#8208;b]quinoline core significantly influenced the absorption and emission characteristics. The 6,8&#8208;dimethoxy substitution pattern was found to provide an optimal balance between high fluorescence quantum yield and moderate Stokes shift, whereas the 5,8&#8208;dimethoxy substitution offered a unique combination of large Stokes shift and long wavelength emission. Additionally, the presence of a trifluoromethyl group at the C&#8208;9 position was identified as a crucial structural feature for maintaining strong fluorescence. These structure&#8208;property relationships provide valuable insights for the rational design of novel fluorescent oxazolo[5,4&#8208;b]quinoline derivatives with tailored photophysical properties, which could find potential applications in the development of fluorescent probes and organic light&#8208;emitting materials.

         <dc:description>
A series of chiral polycyclic 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines were prepared in excellent yields, diastereoselectivities, and enantioselectivities by an asymmetric organocatalytic Michael/hemiketalization/amination process involving 1,3&#8208;diketones and 2,3&#8208;dioxopyrrolidines. The subsequent oxidative aromatization delivered chiral atropisomeric 4&#8208;arylpyridines in moderate to high yields and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
An asymmetric Michael/hemiketalization/amination reaction of 1,3&#8208;diketones with 2,3&#8208;dioxopyrrolidines catalysed by a quinine&#8208;derived urea catalyst has been developed, which furnished a series of chiral polycyclic 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines in satisfactory yields and enantioselectivities (35&#8211;94&#8201;% yield for two steps and up to 99&#8201;% ee). Moreover, the subsequent oxidative aromatization of chiral 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines delivered chiral atropisomeric 4&#8208;arylpyridines in 69&#8211;94&#8201;% yield and up to 95&#8201;% ee.

         <title>Synthesis of Xylo&#8208;nucleoside H&#8208;Phosphinates and Insights into Their Conformational Preferences Within a Chimeric Duplex</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for synthesizing xylo&#8208;nucleoside H&#8208;phosphinate building blocks was developed, and a DNA:XNA:DNA chimeric decamer with a central 2&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;phosphonomethoxy&#8208;linked xylo&#8208;nucleotide was chemically synthesized and analysed. The xylose sugar adopts an N&#8208;type conformation, while the extra methylene group introduces flexibility, disrupting hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions, reducing duplex thermal stability compared to unmodified DNA.

An efficient method for the synthesis of xylo&#8208;nucleoside H&#8208;phosphinate building blocks containing both pyrimidine and purine nucleobases is reported. A DNA&#8208;phoXyloNA&#8208;DNA chimeric sequence containing a central 2&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;phosphonomethoxy&#8208;linked xylo&#8208;nucleoside uracil residue was chemically synthesized, and its structural properties were examined using advanced spectroscopic techniques and computational simulations. Results outlined herein suggest that the xylose sugar moiety predominantly favors an N&#8208;type conformation stabilized by intraresidue hydrogen bonding interactions, while the inclusion of an extra methylene group in the backbone introduces significant flexibility within the internucleotide linkage. Within a duplex structure, disrupted hydrogen bonding interactions in the xU5::dA16 base pair, combined with diminished stacking interactions at the site of modification collectively contribute to a reduction in thermal stability compared to the unmodified counterpart. These findings enhance our understanding of the stability and dynamics of orthogonal backbone&#8208;sugar modified nucleic acids (XNAs), aiding in the design of functionally tailored analogues.

         <title>[3 + 2] Cycloadditions of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Sultams</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable and efficient approach to the synthesis of fused bicyclic and spirocyclic sp3&#8208;enriched sultams via the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition is disclosed. The target cycloadducts are prepared on a multigram scale, and the potential for further functionalization, building block synthesis, and antiviral activity is revealed for selected representatives.







Abstract
A highly efficient multigram synthesis of fused sultams (up to 97&#8197;g in a single run) via the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective [3 + 2] cycloaddition reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated sultams was developed. The scope and limitations of the method were studied by evaluating common 1,3&#8208;dipolar compounds. The reactions with azomethine ylide (obtained from N&#8208;(methoxymethyl)&#8208;N&#8208;(trimethylsilylmethyl)benzylamine), nitrile oxides (generated from chloroximes), and nitrones worked well to give the fused heterocyclic building blocks in a regio&#8208; and diastereoselective manner. In turn, attempted reactions with allenes, azides, and several other 1,3&#8208;dipolar compounds were not fruitful. A series of functional group transformations were applied to obtain fused bicyclic sultam building blocks as promising derivatives for modern drug discovery. In addition to that, antiviral activity was discovered for some representatives of the synthesized bicyclic sultams.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Assisted Excited State Switching and Fluoride Responsive Behavior of Orthogonal Spiroborate Ester Derived from Naturally Occurring &#945;&#8208;Mangostin</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spiro&#8208;centered boron&#8208;based ester (MBO), derived from &#945;&#8208;mangostin (MN), isolated from the pericarp of mangosteen fruit, has been synthesized and characterized. Its photophysical properties and anion&#8208;binding potential were systematically investigated and analyzed using a series of well&#8208;established spectroscopic techniques.







Abstract
This study presents a sustainable and efficient method for synthesizing a spiroborate ester (MBO) from &#945;&#8208;mangostin (MN), a natural xanthonoid isolated from the pericarp of mangosteen fruit. The synthetic process, structural characterization and photophysical properties of MBO are thoroughly discussed. MBO exhibits an absorption band at 370&#8197;nm, with a shoulder around 410&#8211;450&#8197;nm in non&#8208;polar solvents, which shifts to 424&#8197;nm in polar protic solvents. The compound displays green to blue emission, with intensity decreasing in polar protic environments. These spectral changes result from hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted excited state switching between n&#8208;&#960;* and &#960;&#8208;&#960;* states, as confirmed by computational studies. MBO also shows excellent anion binding properties, functioning as a dual&#8208;channel probe for both colorimetric and turn&#8208;on fluorescence detection of fluoride ions. This approach not only adds value to the residual mangosteen pericarp by converting it into a fluorescent sensor but also offers a semisynthetic, environmentally benign alternative to conventional organic receptors for fluoride detection.

         <title>Multianalytical Characterization of Acrylic Industrial Paints Used in Contemporary Mural Art</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contemporary outdoor mural paintings are artworks affected by exposure to sunlight, rain, and environmental pollutants. Three commercial white paints used by street artists are characterized by a multianalytical approach. Analysis of cross sections from samples of two mural paintings reveals the painting technique, while characterization of their materials explains differences in their conservation conditions.

Contemporary outdoor mural paintings have been recognized as artistic expressions closely connected with urban communities. These artworks are prone to suffer deterioration due to exposure to harsh environmental conditions. Therefore, knowledge on painting materials used by street artists is mandatory for the preservation of these paintings. In this study, for the first time, the composition of white household paints of three brands from the local market is investigated. Organic and inorganic components are identified by a multianalytical approach using scanning electron microscopy with energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, attenuated total reflection&#8208;Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray diffraction. The paints contain a styrene&#8211;acrylic copolymer and titanium white in the rutile phase as pigment. Then, two mural paintings are selected to collect samples in order to perform a stratigraphic study and characterize their materials and painting technique. In the mural &#8220;Toad on the wrong way,&#8221; the use of an acrylic resin as varnish contributes to its conservation. In the red sample of &#8220;CIDEC factory,&#8221; the identification of Pigment Red 149 (PR149) allows us to attribute the fading of the red areas to the photo&#8208;oxidation reaction of this synthetic organic pigment.

         <dc:description>Hydrosilylation of terminal alkenes catalyzed by a scandium metalloligand supported Ni(0) complex were studied. The anti&#8208;Markovnikov products were obtained in 62~89% yield, along with the alkanes and 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetraphenyldisilane as minor products. The resting&#8208;state complexes of hydrosilylation reactions were isolated and characterized by spectroscopic method and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, which represent rare&#8208;example of Ni(0) silyl complexes supported by scandium ions via a Ni(0)&#8594;Sc(III) interaction.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Renewable&#8208;based furan compounds derived from 2&#8208;formyl&#8208;5&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)furan (5&#8208;HMF) were successfully employed as catalysts to synthesize cyclic organic carbonates through the reaction of carbon dioxide with epoxides. The effects of temperature, reaction time, reagent ratios, and carbon dioxide pressure were optimized before evaluating various bio&#8208;based complexing agents in combination with different alkali metal halide salts. Among them, 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran (BHTHF) showed the highest efficiency as a complexing agent when paired with sodium bromide (NaBr), enabling the production of industrially relevant cyclic carbonates in high yields (12 examples, achieving 94&#8208;99% epoxide conversion and 70&#8208;99% carbonate selectivity) under mild pressure conditions (carbon dioxide pressure of 1&#8208;10 bar, reaction time of 6 hours, and temperature of 120 &#176;C). Additionally, the BHTHF/NaBr catalytic system demonstrated high stability, maintaining its performance over nine consecutive epoxide additions (8 mmol each) without any loss of efficiency.</dc:description>

Among them, 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran (BHTHF) showed the highest efficiency as a complexing agent when paired with sodium bromide (NaBr), enabling the production of industrially relevant cyclic carbonates in high yields (12 examples, achieving 94-99% epoxide conversion and 70-99% carbonate selectivity) under mild pressure conditions (carbon dioxide pressure of 1-10 bar, reaction time of 6 hours, and temperature of 120 &#176;C). Additionally, the BHTHF/NaBr catalytic system demonstrated high stability, maintaining its performance over nine consecutive epoxide additions (8 mmol each) without any loss of efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Recyclable Rh(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Annulation of N&#8208;Pyrimidinyl Aryl Amines with Cyclic 1,3&#8208;Diones in Water</title>

         <dc:description>
Rh(III)&#8208;Catalysis in Water: A recyclable Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed aqueous C&#8722;H annulation was developed, utilizing solubility differences to enable efficient tetrahydrocarbazole synthesis with simplified recovery and broad substrate compatibility.







Abstract
Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycles via regioselective C&#8722;H bond activation is both highly efficient and atom&#8208;economical but often hindered by the use of toxic solvents and limited catalyst recyclability. Herein, we present a recyclable Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H annulation of N&#8208;pyrimidinyl aryl amines with cyclic 1,3&#8208;diones in water, affording tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives. The basic aqueous environment amplifies the solubility differences between the substrates and the desired product, thereby promoting efficient C&#8722;H activation and subsequent cyclization. This method showcases broad substrate compatibility, eliminates the need for pre&#8208;synthesized iodonium ylides, and features an easy work&#8208;up procedure alongside straightforward catalyst recovery. The Rh(III) catalyst retains its activity for at least five cycles, providing a sustainable and practical strategy for N&#8208;heterocycle synthesis.

         <title>Recent Advances of Enaminones in Multi&#8208;component Reactions: A Brief Review</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enaminones as the valuable and versatile synthons are widely used in organic synthesis, particularly in the form of multicomponent reactions. This review describes recent advances in enaminones involved multi&#8208;component reactions (MCRs). Commonly synthetic strategies, reaction conditions, substrate scopes, reaction features, and the proposed mechanisms of each cited paper were nearly all discussed, and their future outlook is also prospected.







Abstract
As we know, multicomponent reactions have emerged as powerful tools in organic synthesis due to their high atom and step economy, eco&#8208;friendly, diversity, convenience, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, and have broad application prospects in many fields such as drug synthesis, material science and natural product synthesis. On the other side, enaminones, which contain amine&#8208;alkene&#8208;carbonyl conjugated structure possessing multiple reactive sites, have extensively served as versatile building blocks for the construction of diverse organic molecules. In this review, we describe recent advances in enaminones involved multi&#8208;component reactions (MCRs). Commonly synthetic strategies, reaction conditions, substrate scopes, reaction features, and the proposed mechanisms of each cited paper were nearly all discussed, and their future outlook is also prospected.

         <title>Synthesis of N,N'&#8208;Bisindoles via Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Formal (4+1) Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indole&#8208;based heterocycles are commonly found in natural products and pharmaceuticals, so the synthesis of such heterocycles has become an important research area. In spite of the rapid development of this research area, the synthesis of N,N'&#8208;bisindoles remains challenging and is far less developed. Herein, we present the synthesis of N,N'&#8208;bisindoles via gold&#8208;catalyzed formal (4+1) cycloaddition of alkynylcyclohexadienones with N&#8208;aminoindoles, which involves a domino aza&#8208;Meyer&#8208;Schuster rearrangement/aza&#8208;Michael addition sequence. This reaction allows for the formation of two C&#8208;N bonds and the direct construction of indole ring, leading to the synthesis of a range of N,N'&#8208;bisindoles in moderate to high yields with broad functional group tolerance. This work not only provides a new and efficient strategy toward the synthesis of N,N'&#8208;bisindoles, but also enriches the research contents of formal (4+1) cycloadditions and domino reactions.</dc:description>

Pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalines and pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalin&#8208;4(5H)&#8208;ones have garnered significant research interest due to their diverse biological activities and potential pharmaceutical applications. This review systematically summarizes the latest synthesis methods for constructing pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalines and pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalin&#8208;4(5H)&#8208;ones, categorized by starting materials, including those from nitrobenzenes, azides, benzimidazoles, and others.







Abstract
Pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalines and pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalin&#8208;4(5H)&#8208;ones are recognized as important tricyclic scaffolds due to their diverse pharmacological activities, including anticancer, anti&#8208;fungi, anti&#8208;tuberculosis, and antimalarial, as well as their roles as 5&#8208;HT3 receptor agonists and kinase inhibitors targeting CK2 and AKT, and others. Developing efficient and reliable synthetic approaches to access these compounds remains an attractive goal in contemporary medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. This review highlights recent advances in the synthesis of pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalines and pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalin&#8208;4(5H)&#8208;ones, particularly focusing on strategies that maintain the A and C&#8208;rings while constructing the B&#8208;ring through the formation of a&#8208;, b&#8208;, and c&#8208;bonds. The information collected describes the two key components of the synthesis process 1&#8208;(2&#8208;Substitued&#8208;phenyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole and aldehyde or its surrogate. This review also briefly summarizes the reaction mechanisms for the formation of tricyclic skeletons to determine the key factors governing the issues of productivity and regioselectivity. Through analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of existing synthetic methods, we predict that A&#8208;ring formation strategy&#8208;based pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxaline reactions will be developed in the future. We hope that this review will motivate the search for novel strategies to synthesize pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalines and pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;&#945;]quinoxalin&#8208;4(5H)&#8208;ones, accessing tricyclic skeletons that may have potential applications in medicinal chemistry, materials science, and many branches of chemistry.

         <title>Recent Developments in C&#8722;H Functionalization and Annulation of 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Quinazolinones and 3&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Quinazolinones via Site Selective Transformations</title>

         <dc:description>
The selective transformations of quinazolinones through transition metal catalysed C&#8722;H bonds functionalization via amide nitrogen site annulation and aryl nitrogen site annulation is a valuable synthetic tool, that has been explored by various chemists and medicinal chemistry researchers. This review provides an extensive study of directing group (DG)&#8208;assisted site selective transformation of quinazolinones using transition metal as catalyst.







Abstract
Quinazolinone is a crucial scaffold in numerous natural compounds, as well as in biologically active and functional materials. Consequently, various synthetic methods have been developed to transform quinazolinone and its derivatives. Site selective C&#8722;H bond functionalization and annulation of the 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;quinazolinones and 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;quinazolinones skeleton through transition&#8208;metal catalysis offer an efficient approach to obtain diverse substituted nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic frameworks. This review summarizes recent reports on transition&#8208;metal catalyzed site selective transformations of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;quinazolinone and 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;quinazolinones through C&#8722;H functionalization and annulation reactions.

         <title>Axially Chiral Naphthalol Benzo&#8208;Quinoline Ligands for the Cu(OTf)2&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Cyclopropanation of &#945;&#8208;Arylidene Diazosuccinimides and Styrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new class of axially chiral arylphenol&#8208;quinoline ligands, synthesized via a scalable Combes quinoline route using NOBIN and H8&#8208;NOBIN. Ligand L1, in combination with Cu(OTf)&#8322;, catalyzed the enantioselective cyclopropanation of &#945;&#8208;arylidene diazosuccinimides and styrenes, yielding chiral spirocyclopropane succinimides with high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities (&#8805;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 er, &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr).







Abstract
A new class of axially chiral arylphenol&#8208;quinoline ligands was designed and prepared from commercially available 2&#8242;&#8208;amino[1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalen]&#8208;2&#8208;ol (NOBIN) and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;5,5&#8242;,6,6&#8242;,7,7&#8242;,8,8&#8242;&#8208;octahydro&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl (H8&#8208;NOBIN). Of these ligands, L1 combined effectively with Cu(OTf)2 to catalyze the cyclopropanation reactions of &#945;&#8208;arylidene diazosuccinimides and styrenes. Consequently, the desired multifunctional products bearing untouched arylidene groups were obtained in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;excellent enantioselectivities (&#8804;96&#8201;:&#8201;4 er) and diastereoselectivities (&#8804;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 dr) with moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields (&#8804;83&#8201;%). After simple recrystallization, the diastereoselectivities and enantioselectivities of the chiral products were considerably improved (&#8805;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 er with &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) in most cases. This approach provides an efficient solution for the preparation of high&#8208;optical&#8208;purity multifunctional &#945;&#8208;arylidene spirocyclopropane succinimides, potentially valuable as chiral synthons and platform molecules which may be transformed into diverse functional chiral molecules by reaction at different functional sites.

         <title>Pincer Ligand Facilitated Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pincer ligands exhibit features of stability and control of activity and selectivity during catalysis. They participate in multicomponent reactions by either coordinating with single metals or integrating into metal nanoclusters, triggering the formation of carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;nitrogen bonds with high efficiency.







Abstract
Multicomponent reactions hold a significant position in the field of organic synthetic chemistry as they can rapidly construct structurally diverse molecules with high atom economy. Pincer ligands possess unique structural and electronic properties, exhibiting remarkable catalytic activity and selectivity in multicomponent reactions. This review systematically elaborates on the research progress of multicomponent reactions involving pincer ligands, thoroughly discussing their mechanism of action in different reaction systems, including crucial aspects such as substrate activation modes, the formation and transformation of reaction intermediates. Meanwhile, an in&#8208;depth analysis of the relationship between the structures of various pincer ligands and their reaction performance is carried out, and multiple representative reaction examples are presented, such as multicomponent transformation processes of carbon&#8208;carbon bond and carbon&#8208;nitrogen bond formation reactions catalyzed by metal&#8208;pincer complexes or metal&#8208;pincer nanoclusters. Furthermore, the future development of multicomponent reactions involving pincer ligands are prospected. It is anticipated that they will play a more crucial role in the development of novel organic synthetic methodologies, drug synthesis, and materials science, providing valuable references and inspiration for researchers in related fields.

         <title>Reversible Stannylenoid Formation from the Corresponding Stannylene and Sodium Phosphaethynolate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work described the synthesis of stannylenoid 2 from dialkylstannylene and sodium phosphaethynolate (NaOCP). The stability of 2 in THF and its reactivity under irradiation, leading to the formation of compound 7, are investigated. Structural characterization by X&#8208;ray diffraction and DFT calculations reveals an Sn&#8322;P&#8322; four&#8208;membered ring, shedding light on stannylenoid reactivity and its synthetic potential.







Abstract
This study reports the synthesis of a novel stannylenoid 2 through the reaction of dialkylstannylene with sodium phosphaethynolate (NaOCP), followed by investigation of its reactivity and stability. Stannylenoid 2 exhibits high stability in THF and remains intact under elevated temperatures for extended periods. Upon irradiation, 2 undergoes CO release reaction, forming a highly stable compound 7. The solid&#8208;state structure of 7, determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, reveals a diamond&#8208;shaped Sn&#8322;P&#8322; moiety with distorted tetrahedral geometry. Computational studies using density functional theory (DFT) confirm the experimental findings, showing strong Sn&#8722;P bonding and a nucleophilic character for the phosphorus atoms.

     alt="Reversible Stannylenoid Formation from the Corresponding Stannylene and Sodium Phosphaethynolate"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work described the synthesis of stannylenoid &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; from dialkylstannylene and sodium phosphaethynolate (NaOCP). The stability of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; in THF and its reactivity under irradiation, leading to the formation of compound &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;, are investigated. Structural characterization by X-ray diffraction and DFT calculations reveals an Sn&#8322;P&#8322; four-membered ring, shedding light on stannylenoid reactivity and its synthetic potential.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study reports the synthesis of a novel stannylenoid &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; through the reaction of dialkylstannylene with sodium phosphaethynolate (NaOCP), followed by investigation of its reactivity and stability. Stannylenoid &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; exhibits high stability in THF and remains intact under elevated temperatures for extended periods. Upon irradiation, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; undergoes CO release reaction, forming a highly stable compound &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;. The solid-state structure of &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;, determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, reveals a diamond-shaped Sn&#8322;P&#8322; moiety with distorted tetrahedral geometry. Computational studies using density functional theory (DFT) confirm the experimental findings, showing strong Sn&#8722;P bonding and a nucleophilic character for the phosphorus atoms. The results provide new insights into the reactivity of stannylenoids and their potential applications in synthetic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Terpenes and&#160;Terpenoids: How&#160;Can we Use&#160;them?</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The employed feedstocks in chemical processes received substantial attention over the past decades, mainly due to the popularity of Werpy&#8217;s list of top&#8208;value added chemicals from biomass reported in 2004. The conventional fossil&#8208;based feedstocks are both depleting and can be damaging to the environment. This led to a surge to replace petroleum&#8208;based chemicals to more renewable, bio&#8208;based platform chemicals. Terpenes and terpenoids are a group of bio&#8208;based compounds that are well known. However, there comprehensive overviews of the chemistry that these compounds have been used for are scarce. Herein, we provide a full comprehensive overview of the reported chemistry with terpenes while specifically highlighting their reactivity. Fifteen of the most common and useful monoterpenes and terpenoids are discussed, followed by a list of the remaining known compounds belonging to this group. The fifteen compounds have been employed in a vast number of chemical transformations with different applications including: polymerizations, total syntheses, chiral reagents/auxiliaries, pharmaceuticals, and chemical conversion to other useful bio&#8208;based chemicals. We believe that the presented chemistry in this work will provide chemists with a useful tool that should facilitate and stimulate the search for more sustainable, renewable and environmentally friendly starting points for novel synthesis routes.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized Cyclooctynes as Building Blocks for Non&#8208;covalent Surface&#8208;Orthogonal Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various syntheses of cyclooctynes substituted with functional groups capable for hydrogen bonding (amide, imide, carboxylic acid) are reported. These are potential building blocks for surface&#8208;orthogonal molecular architecture on the Si(001) surface.







Abstract
Cyclooctynes substituted with functional groups capable for hydrogen bonding (amide, imide, carboxylic acid) have been synthesized. The 8&#8208;membered ring was derived from cyclooctadiene, by Beckmann rearrangement or by ring&#8208;closing metathesis. The transannular instability of a monocyclic cyclooctyne lactam was postulated. Three stable functionalized cyclooctynes obtained are candidates for a surface&#8208;orthogonal layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer synthesis on semiconductor surfaces (in particular the Si(001) surface).

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an in&#8208;depth exploration of recent progress in palladium&#8208;catalyzed phosphonation, focusing on the use of aryl halides, sulfonates and related derivatives as key substrates. It discusses innovations in catalytic systems, reaction conditions, and substrate versatility while addressing limitations such as low reactivity of certain substrates and the challenges in asymmetric synthesis. Future directions for improving reaction efficiency and expanding applications in pharmaceuticals, catalysis, and materials science are also highlighted.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed phosphonation has emerged as a significant development in the synthesis of organophosphorus acid compounds. This review covers the literature published from 1980 to 2024, systematically examining the current progress, challenges, and future directions in this rapidly evolving field. The review begins with an introduction to the significance of phosphorus chemistry in both academic research and industrial applications and then explores traditional methods for synthesizing phosphonation compounds, emphasizing the limitations of these methods and the need for innovative reaction conditions. The central focus is on recent advancements in palladium&#8208;catalyzed phosphonation, with detailed discussions of key milestones, reaction mechanisms, and the scope of substrate applicability. The review also analyzes the roles of different palladium sources, ligands, and reaction conditions, highlighting their effects on reaction efficiency and selectivity. Finally, the conclusion summarizes recent developments and proposes future research directions to address existing challenges and expand the scope of palladium&#8208;catalyzed phosphonation.

         <title>Photochemical Multicomponent Synthesis of Six&#8208;Membered Heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article covers the recent development achieved in the visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced multicomponent synthesis of six&#8208;membered heterocyclic compounds and six&#8208;membered heterocycle containing spirooxindoles.







Abstract
Despite the efficient progress achieved in the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds, accessing these molecules by combining both visible lights induced radical chemistry and multicomponent reactions is extremely demanding yet challenging. Recognizing the significant features associated with oxygen&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds, the search for these attractive molecules in nature and developing new synthetic strategies for synthesizing these molecules remain interesting domain for synthetic chemists. In this mini&#8208;review article, we aim to demonstrate a transitory outline of the recent development achieved in the synthesis of six&#8208;membered heterocycles having oxygen and nitrogen as the major heteroatoms as well as six&#8208;membered heterocycle containing spirooxindole molecules based on visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photochemical multicomponent reactions strategies.

     alt="Photochemical Multicomponent Synthesis of Six-Membered Heterocycles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review article covers the recent development achieved in the visible-light-induced multicomponent synthesis of six-membered heterocyclic compounds and six-membered heterocycle containing spirooxindoles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the efficient progress achieved in the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds, accessing these molecules by combining both visible lights induced radical chemistry and multicomponent reactions is extremely demanding yet challenging. Recognizing the significant features associated with oxygen- and nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds, the search for these attractive molecules in nature and developing new synthetic strategies for synthesizing these molecules remain interesting domain for synthetic chemists. In this mini-review article, we aim to demonstrate a transitory outline of the recent development achieved in the synthesis of six-membered heterocycles having oxygen and nitrogen as the major heteroatoms as well as six-membered heterocycle containing spirooxindole molecules based on visible-light-induced photochemical multicomponent reactions strategies. Besides addressing the key success of the reaction design and product developments in this promising area, we have also emphasized the major shortcomings and challenges associated with the reaction discovery in order to stimulate further succeeding investigations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The design of some novel disubstituted 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;ethano&#8208;1,5&#8208;naphthyridine derivatives is reported under classical and flow methodologies. The series were developed from quinuclidinone, which afforded versatile platforms bearing one lactam function in position C&#8208;2 that was then used to create C&#8211;N bond using the Chan&#8208;Lam coupling reaction or in situ C&#8211;O bond activation via palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The conditions were optimized, and a wide range of boronic acids were used to determine the scope and limitations of each method. To complete this study, a flow Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura process was established to afford polyfunctionalized 1,4&#8208;ethano&#8208;1,5&#8208;naphthyridine derivatives in high yields with a very efficient process (10 min.).</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Component Domino Strategy for Regioselective Synthesis of Tetrahydrothiochromen&#8208;5&#8208;ones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silica&#8208;supported sulfuric acid&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component domino strategy involving &#946;&#8208; oxodithioesters, aromatic aldehydes and 1,3&#8208;cyclohexanediones has been developed for the regioselective synthesis of tetrahydro&#8208;5H&#8208;thiochromen&#8208;5&#8208;ones under solvent&#8208;free conditions. The reaction proceeded through the construction of two new C&#8722;C and one C&#8722;S bonds in a single step to afford high product yields.







Abstract
A sustainable one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;component domino strategy for the regioselective synthesis of tetrahydrothiochromen&#8208;5&#8208;ones has been developed using inexpensive, stable, and recyclable silica&#8208;supported sulfuric acid as the heterogeneous catalyst under solvent&#8208;free conditions. This strategy enabled us to access a diverse range of valuable tetrahydrothiochromen&#8208;5&#8208;ones up to a 93&#8201;% yield via annulation of &#946;&#8208;oxodithioesters with aromatic aldehydes and 1,3&#8208;cyclohexanediones. Furthermore, the catalyst was efficiently recovered, recycled, and reused for four cycles without a significant loss of catalytic activity, thus demonstrating the robustness of the devised methodology and its potential applicability in sustainable organic synthesis of the protocol.

         <title>Direct Coupling of Polyfluoroarenes with Acylsilanes Under Metal&#8208;Free Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct coupling of polyfluoroarenes with acylsilanes in the presence of a catalytic amount of a strong base under exceptionally mild conditions has been realized. This reaction proceeds directly without the needs for photoirradiation and a metal catalyst, and features mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, and significant potentials for preparing fluorinated bioactive molecules.







Abstract
The installation of polyfluoroaryl group in functional molecules is of interest due to the presence of polyfluoroarenes in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and advanced materials. Herein, we report the direct coupling of polyfluoroarenes with acylsilanes for synthesis of fluorinated benzylic alcohols in the presence of a catalytic base. This reaction could tolerate a wide range of polyfluoroarenes and polyfluoroheteroarenes, providing an efficient entry to fluoroarylated compounds. Deuteration experiments showed that the hydrogen source in the product was mainly from the polyfluoroarenes. The utility of this method was demonstrated by the derivatization of the product and the synthesis of a fluorinated analogue with antituberculous activity.

         <title>Synthesis of Heteroatom&#8208;Containing Organic Molecules via Intramolecular Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteroatom&#8208;containing organic molecules hold a pivotal position in organic chemistry. Due to their extensive applications in pharmaceuticals and material science, the synthesis of these compounds under mild reaction conditions is highly significant. In this regard, intramolecular cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling has emerged as a promising strategy in synthetic organic chemistry. This review summarizes the recent developments in the synthesis of biologically active heterocycles via intramolecular cross dehydrogenative coupling under transition&#8208;metal free conditions.







Abstract
Heterocyclic compounds or heterocycles constitute the most prominent class of organic chemistry. The extensive functional utility of these compounds in pharmaceuticals and material science has led to increased research interest in this area. Since heteroatom containing molecules hold a pivotal position in both chemistry and biology, a number of methodologies have already been known for their synthesis. However, advancement in the synthetic methodology for their construction under mild reaction conditions is highly important. In the current scenario of research, intramolecular cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling has emerged as a promising strategy in the synthesis of complex organic molecules from simpler ones via direct C&#8722;H functionalization. This one&#8208;pot atom&#8208;economic protocol can construct fused heterocycles that are both pharmaceutically and medicinally important. The present review focuses on transition&#8208;metal free synthesis of heteroatom containing organic molecules intramolecularly through carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) and carbon&#8208;heteroatom (C&#8722;X) bond formation reactions reported over past one decade.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Atropisomeric Diarylamines Enabled by Bromine&#8208;Masked Indolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the use of a bromine atom as a masking group for the synthesis atropisomeric diarylamines via organocatalytic N&#8208;arylation of 7&#8208;bromoindolines. The bromine atom acts as a bulky group to temporarily stabilize the configuration by steric hindrance. Upon unmasking, less sterically hindered diarylamines are obtained, with configurational stability potentially maintained through intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Moreover, the gram&#8208;scale reaction and post&#8208;modifications of the axially chiral diarylamines demonstrated the utility of this protocol. Thermal racemization experiments combined with X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed the respective contributions of steric repulsion and intramolecular hydrogen bonding in stabilizing the configurations. This approach not only provides a useful method for the atroposelective construction of conical diarylamines, but also paves the way for a better understanding of stable axial chirality and its role in shaping chemical reactivity and biological activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioelective Hydroformylation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Ester: Spectroscopic Studies on Catalytic Species and the Influence of Ligands on Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroformylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8209;unsaturated esters is an atom&#8208;economical route towards aldehydes as precursors for pharmaceuticals. In this work, regioselective hydroformylation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8209;unsaturated ester to the &#946;&#8209;aldehyde was initially re&#8208;evaluated using a commercial Rh&#160;catalyst sample named [HRh(PPh3)4] due to reported high selectivity for the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde with this type of catalyst. However, while such high selectivity was achieved, subsequent investigation of this sample by high&#8208;pressure NMR and in situ IR spectroscopy under process conditions revealed a behavior like a phosphine&#8208;free system, indicating that the sample is decomposed and may be present as rhodium carbonyl clusters. This hypothesis has been supported by hydroformylation experiments with and without phosphine ligands. While a strong decrease in regioselectivity to the &#946;&#8209;aldehyde was observed in the presence of triphenylphosphine as added ligand, phosphine&#8208;free rhodium complexes led to high regioselectivities. In detail, the hydroformylation showed high regioselectivity (91%) and overall selectivity to the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde (70&#8211;77%) with [Rh6(CO)16] as well as [Rh(acac)(CO)2] as ligand&#8208;free rhodium complexes. With further unmodified, phosphine&#8208;free rhodium compounds as catalysts, again high regioselectivities (90&#8211;93%) towards the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde were obtained. Thus, our results indicate that non&#8208;modified triphenylphosphine&#8208;free Rh&#160;catalysts are efficient catalysts for regioselective hydroformylation of &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylates to the &#946;&#8208;aldehyde.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes are valuable synthetic intermediates in organofluorine chemistry; however, their reactivity often involves intermediates prone to fluorine elimination, leading to monofluorinated products. Here, we present a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed dioxygenation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes with alcohols, which retains both fluorine atoms and yields &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers. This method is operationally simple, employs inexpensive and standard reagents, and demonstrates broad functional group tolerance. The reaction is scalable, enabling the use of the gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropane motif as a masked precursor for &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers in synthetic sequences. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest a radical&#8208;mediated process involving concerted SN2&#8208;like ring&#8208;opening functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances on Light&#8208;Mediated Nitrene Transfer Reactions: An Emerging Area</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen atoms are fundamental in biological systems and are widely found in approved drugs, natural products, and materials. Thus, catalytic methods for the C&#8208;N bond formation have attracted significant attention in synthetic chemistry. Among the toolbox, nitrene transfer reaction is one of the powerful protocols for the construction of N&#8208;incorporating frameworks with structural diversity. In this field, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer reactions have been extensively explored using different types of precursors. On the other hand, photochemistry offers a sustainable protocol in synthetic chemistry, which has emerged as an eco&#8208;friendly catalytic method in nitrene chemistry, particularly, with the induction of visible light as the initiator in this area. In the last decade, a variety of visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated synthetic transformations involving free nitrene species have been reported under mild reaction conditions. Thus, it is timely and highly desirable to summarize the advancements in this area. This review summarized the advances in photo&#8208;mediated nitrene transfer reactions from 1950s to 2024, which is organized into two sections according to the protocols for the nitrene formation: (i) direct photolysis of diverse nitrene precursors and (ii) photocatalytic generation of free nitrenes. The detailed reaction mechanisms and synthetic potential are the main focus in this review article.</dc:description>
