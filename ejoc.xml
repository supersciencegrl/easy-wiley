         <title>The activation of carbonyl compounds catalyzed by primary amines: a study of reactions and pathway intermediates by mass spectrometry.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The field of organocatalysis is expanding at a fast pace. Its growth is sustained by major stimuli, such as the effort toward an understanding of the mechanisms of reaction and catalytic processes in general, the elucidation of basic properties leading to stereocontrol and the search for broad applicability and scalability of the synthetic methodology. This paper reports a thorough study based on ESI&#8208;MS spectrometry of amino&#8208;organocatalyzed model reactions under different experimental conditions. Off&#8208;line reaction monitoring of mixtures containing different catalytic systems, by ESI&#8208;MS  n  showed the presence of several putative intermediate species, either in their protonated or sodiated forms. In addition, enantioselective chromatography of crude reactions provides the stereochemical outcome of asymmetric reactions. The bulk of the data collected offers a clue of the intricate pathways occurring in solution for the studied reactions.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of bench&#8208;stable electrophilic thiocyanating reagents was depicted in two steps from readily available starting materials in good yields. These newly&#8208;designed electrophilic reagents were successfully applied for the thiocyanation of different nucleophiles under mild and transition metal&#8208;free conditions. Preliminary experiments for the asymmetric C3&#8208;thiocyanation of an oxindole derivative were also conducted leading to the expected product with no induction of chirality, although opening possibilities for accessing chiral compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free and syn&#8208;Selective Hydrohalogenation of Alkynes through a Pseudo&#8208;Intramolecular Process</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows pseudo&#8208;intramolecular hydrochlorination of ethynylaniline, which proceeds efficiently in syn&#8208;selective and regioselective mode even in the absence of any metal catalyst. This process is initiated by salt formation of the substrate and HCl. When HCl is liberated under equilibrium, the spatial proximity facilitates the efficient electrophilic addition of HCl to the ethynyl group affording the corresponding chloroalkene without overaddition. This process is similar to the way angular fish use pseudo&#8208;lure to attract and capture fish. More information can be found in the Full Paper by H. Asahara, N. Nishiwaki et&#8197;al.

A one&#8208;pot synthesis protocol for 2&#8208;amido&#8208;3&#8208;bromobenzo[b]thiophenes and their analogs based on C&#8722;N coupling and subsequent Selectfluor&#8208;mediated oxidative bromocyclization reactions was described. This method is not only step&#8208;economical as it is one&#8208;pot operative in a modular fashion but also recycles Br&#8722; byproduct which is generated from the first C&#8722;N coupling step for bromocyclization.







Abstract
A one&#8208;pot synthesis of 2&#8208;amido&#8208;3&#8208;bromobenzo[b]thiophenes based on C&#8722;N coupling and oxidative bromocyclization reactions was developed. This enables a modular approach to obtain diverse substituents at the C2 position of benzothiophenes by employing structurally modified sulfonamides. Oxidative cyclization was driven by Selectfluor and represents a previously unreported recycling method for the bromide anion byproducts of the C&#8722;N bond coupling step. The details of the study are described fully herein.

         <title>Diethylaminosulfur Trifluoride (DAST) Mediated Transformations Leading to Valuable Building Blocks and Bioactive Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 41, Page 5585-5604, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview provides an overview of methods employing DAST to obtain valuable building blocks and compounds having pharmacological features. Fluorination of &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols, proceeding through opening of an aziridinium ion, leading to rearranged products was described in detail. In addition, the intramolecular cyclization induced by DAST resulting in unprecedent heterocyclic compounds was presented. The description of neighboring group participation and debenzylative cycloetherification in the synthesis of sugars derivatives will probably be of interest to scientists dealing with carbohydrate chemistry.







Abstract
Nucleophilic fluorination is one of the fundamental reactions in organic chemistry, as well as a convenient tool for the synthesis of fluorinated building blocks with a potential biological activity. In this minireview, diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST) mediated reactions leading to valuable building blocks and bioactive compounds will be discussed. We focused on results that have been published since 2010. Transformation of &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols, heterocyclic frameworks synthesis, as well as rearrangement reactions have been described in detail.

An efficient method for the preparation of &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylporphyrins was developed through the reaction of &#946;&#8208;silylated Zn(II) porphyrins by using a phenanthroline and triphenylphosphine&#8208;ligated trifluoromethyl&#8211;copper complex [(phen)(Ph3P)CuCF3].







Abstract
We developed a method for the regioselective &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylation of &#946;&#8208;silylated Zn(II) porphyrins by using a phenanthroline and triphenylphosphine&#8208;ligated trifluoromethyl&#8211;copper complex [(phen)(Ph3P)CuCF3]. The regioselective porphyrin trifluoromethylation, which occurs under mild conditions, exhibits excellent substrate generality and functional group compatibility.

&lt;p&gt;An efficient method for the preparation of &#946;-trifluoromethylporphyrins was developed through the reaction of &#946;-silylated Zn(II) porphyrins by using a phenanthroline and triphenylphosphine-ligated trifluoromethyl&#8211;copper complex [(phen)(Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P)CuCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;].

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed a method for the regioselective &#946;-trifluoromethylation of &#946;-silylated Zn(II) porphyrins by using a phenanthroline and triphenylphosphine-ligated trifluoromethyl&#8211;copper complex [(phen)(Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P)CuCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]. The regioselective porphyrin trifluoromethylation, which occurs under mild conditions, exhibits excellent substrate generality and functional group compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Front Cover: Synthesis, Reactivity and Activation Modes of Fluoroalkyl Thiosulfonates and Selenosulfonates (Eur. J. Org. Chem. 41/2021)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 41, Page 5569-5569, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows highly versatile reagents gravitating in the galaxy of reactions aiming to introduce fluorine&#8208;containing units, namely fluoroalkylchalcogenosulfonates. Indeed, this family of compounds enables trifluoromethylation, trifluoromethylsulfonylation, fluoroalkylthiolation, and fluoroalkylselenolation reactions through several activation modes. Thus, these valuable fluorinated motifs can be introduced following electrophilic, nucleophilic, or radical pathways onto a plethora of organic substrates. More information can be found in the Minireview by C. Ghiazza and T. Billard.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Phosphorylation of 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;1,4&#8208;naphthoquinones with H&#8208;Phosphonates</title>

An efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed phosphorylation of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,4&#8208;naphthoquinones with H&#8208;phosphonates via a radical process was developed for the first time. This protocol allows for the synthesis of a variety of phosphoryl&#8208;functionalized 2&#8208;amino 1,4&#8208;naphthoquinones in moderate to good yields under mild conditions.







Abstract
As a simple and efficient system, Cu(OAc)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O and K2S2O8 can activate H&#8208;phosphonates to produce the corresponding dialkyl phosphoryl radicals. The obtained dialkyl phosphoryl radicals react smoothly with 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,4&#8208;naphthoquinones, affording accurate preparation of various phosphoryl&#8208;functionalized 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,4&#8208;naphthoquinones. The developed copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;dehydrogenative phosphorylation features broad substrate scope, easily available reagents, high atom economy and operational simplicity, which enables a practical avenue for C&#8722;P bond formation.

C2&#8208;symmetric dibenzylic diselenides: A synthetic method for (highly enantioenriched) dibenzylic diselenides by SN2 nucleophilic substitution of (enantioenriched) quaternary ammonium salts and elemental selenium is described.







Abstract
Abstract: Substituted dibenzyl diselenides are synthesized in good yields (74&#8211;91&#8201;%) by SN2 nucleophilic substitution of benzylic trimethylammonium salts and diselenide dianion (Se2&#8722;), in&#8197;situ generated from elemental selenium, under basic conditions. Highly enantiopure dibenzylic diselenides (95&#8211;98&#8201;% ee) with reverse configurations to their enantioenriched quaternary ammonium salts are obtained, if benzylic quaternary ammonium salts, synthesized from enantiomerically enriched amines, are used.

         <title>Cover Feature: Diethylaminosulfur Trifluoride (DAST) Mediated Transformations Leading to Valuable Building Blocks and Bioactive Compounds (Eur. J. Org. Chem. 41/2021)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 41, Page 5570-5570, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows some of the transformations of molecules using diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST). This minireview reveals that DAST does not only act as a fluorinating reagent, which as a result of nucleophilic substitution replaces the hydroxyl group with a fluorine atom but is also a mediator of other processes. It participates in rearrangement and cyclization reactions, resulting in valuable heterocyclic compounds, both fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated. Thus, it leads to significant building blocks as well as biologically active molecules. The authors would like to thank Gabriela Orczykowska for the graphic project and creation. More information can be found in the Minireview by M. Ka&#378;mierczak and M. Bilska&#8208;Markowska.

Pseudo&#8208;benzylic substitution promoted by fluorinated solvent from various iodoferrocenes is described. These new reaction conditions allow the fast generation of libraries of derivatives for applications in catalysis for example, as demonstrated with the synthesis of original ligands used in cross&#8208;coupling reactions.







Abstract
Pseudo&#8208;benzylic substitution is an important reaction in the ferrocene series, especially to obtain ligands for catalysis. Herein, we described new reactions conditions, using fluorinated alcohols as both solvent and promoter, able to deliver iodoferrocene derivatives faster than using classical solvents. Various N, O, P and C&#8208;nucleophiles were found compatible with this transformation which occurs with full retention of stereochemistry. Original P,N&#8208;ligands were prepared by using iodine/lithium exchange&#8208;chlorophoshine trapping sequences, and their properties were evaluated in Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura and Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig coupling as well as in ketone &#945;&#8208;arylation reaction.

         <title>An Environmentally Benign, Catalyst&#8208;Free N&#8722;C Bond Cleavage/Formation of Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Unactivated Amides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 41, Page 5627-5639, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented methodology for the synthesis of a variety of organic amides through the coupling of wide range of unactivated primary, secondary, and tertiary diversified amides, with different amines is reported. The acid&#8208;promoted reaction is proposed to proceed through carbonyl activation and is accompanied by broad substrate scope with high tolerance for functional groups.







Abstract
Herein, we report an operationally simple, cheap, and catalyst&#8208;free method for the transamidation of a diverse range of unactivated amides furnishing the desired products in excellent yields. This protocol is environmentally friendly and operates under extremely mild conditions without using any promoter or additives. Significantly, this strategy has been implied in the chemoselective synthesis of a pharmaceutical molecule, paracetamol, on a gram&#8208;scale with excellent yield. We anticipate that this universally applicable strategy will be of great interest in drug discovery, biochemistry, and organic synthesis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Promoted Glycosylation for the Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;Glycosyl Sulfonyl Amides</title>

Glycosyl sulfonyl amides are synthesized in a self&#8208;promoted N&#8208;glycosylation with high &#946;&#8208;selectivity and in high yields. Armed and disarmed glycosyl donors of different size and with different protective groups react smoothly with sulfonyl amides, such as protected asparagine derivatives. Influence of solvents, concentration, temperature and stoichiometry is studied.







Abstract
N&#8208;Glycosyl N&#8208;sulfonyl amides have been synthesized by a self&#8208;promoted glycosylation, i.&#8201;e. without any catalysts, promotors or additives. When the reactions were carried out at lower temperatures a mixture of N&#8208; and O&#8208;glycosides were observed, where the latter rearranged to give the &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;glycosides at elevated temperatures. By this method sulfonylated asparagine derivatives can be selectively &#946;&#8208;glycosylated in high yields by trichloroacetimidate glycosyl donors of different reactivity including protected glucosamine derivatives. The chemoselectivity in the glycosylations as well as the rearrangements from O&#8208;glycosides to &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;glycosides gives information of the glycosylation mechanism. This method gives access to glycosyl sulfonyl amides under mild conditions.

A simple and highly regioselective hydrogenolysis of the anomeric benzyl group is reported. The generality and the scope of the reaction were evaluated by applying it to a number of diversly protected benzyl monosaccharides and disaccharides that lead to the formation of the corresponding hemiacetals in good yield.







Abstract
A highly regioselective hydrogenolysis of the anomeric benzyl group is reported. The reaction involves selective acetolysis of benzyl acetals of various mono&#8208; and di&#8208;saccharides using 10&#8201;% Pd/C under hydrogen atmosphere in the presence of Na2CO3. The generality of the methodology is evaluated by applying it to a number of perbenzylated/orthogonally protected benzyl glycosides.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Glycosylation from per&#8208;O&#8208;Acylated Donors Catalyzed by Methanesulfonic Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 41, Page 5669-5676, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel glycosylation procedure has been developed, featuring extremely low cost as well as experimental and environmental advantages. It is based on the direct activation of per&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated (or benzoylated) sugars by 5&#8197;mol&#8201;% of cheap and eco&#8208;friendly methanesulfonic acid, under air in the absence of any solvent. Several products, including non&#8208;trivial glycosides and disaccharides, can be quickly obtained with good 1,2&#8208;trans stereoselectivity.







Abstract
The huge importance of carbohydrates and their derivatives in biomedical and industrial applications call for the development of streamlined and sustainable procedures for their synthetic elaboration. Here reported a novel glycosylation method based on direct activation of readily available per&#8208;O&#8208;acylated (acetylated or benzoylated) donors, promoted under air by methanesulfonic acid as a cheap and green catalyst in the absence of any solvent. Besides the beneficial avoidance of toxic and polluting organic solvents, these conditions were found critical for activating such poorly reactive donors with a very small catalyst loading (only 5&#8197;mol&#8201;%), instead of stoichiometric Lewis acid promoters typically employed. Desired glycosides were quickly obtained, in most cases with high 1,2&#8208;trans stereoselectivity. Other main advantages over reported glycosylations with similar donors are the limited stoichiometric excess of the acceptor (or the donor), the easy applicability and low cost of the procedure and the wide target scope, also covering the synthesis of disaccharides and other non&#8208;trivial glycosides with applicable potential.

         <title>C2&#8208;(1 N/2 N&#8208;Methyl&#8208;tetrazole)methyl Ether (MeTetMe) as a Stereodirecting Group for 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;O&#8208;Glycosylation</title>

The C2&#8208;(1&#8197;N/2&#8197;N)&#8208;methylated tetrazole methyl (MeTetMe) ether directed stereoselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosides is described. The strategy has been found successful for both gluco&#8208; and galacto&#8208; configured donors when glycosylated with a broad range of alcohols to yield adducts in high to exclusive stereoselectivity. The newly developed substituted methyl ether has been easily introduced from cyanomethyl ether precursor and efficiently removed under Birch reduction conditions.







Abstract
Development of stereoselective synthetic methods for O&#8208;glycosides is of paramount importance in the field of glycochemistry. Therefore, we report herein (1&#8197;N/2&#8197;N)&#8208;methylated tetrazole methyl (MeTetMe) ethers as a C2&#8208;directing group for the formation of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosides. The synthesis of the tetrazole moiety was readily achieved by a 3+2 cycloaddition reaction on nitrile functionality. The tethered thioglycoside donors were found to deliver the &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosides when activated by PIFA&#8208;TfOH reagent system. The reactions were performed with six newly synthesized phenyl and ethyl thioglycosides to obtain the glycosylated adducts in moderate to high yields and excellent to exclusive &#946;&#8208;selectivity. The glycosylation method was easily scalable up to grams without affecting the yield and stereoselectivity. The MeTetMe group was efficiently removed under Birch reduction conditions without affecting the benzyl ethers or isopropylidene acetal protection.

         <title>Cycloaddition Reactions of in&#8197;situ Generated C2D2 in Dioxane: Efficient Synthetic Approach to D2&#8208;Labeled Nitrogen Heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 41, Page 5640-5648, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient synthetic procedures for the preparation of D2&#8208;labeled nitrogen heterocycles via cycloaddition reactions of dideuteroacetylene in 1,4&#8208;dioxane were developed. The proposed approach is suitable for the synthesis of four classes of D2&#8208;labeled heterocycles including triazoles, isoxazoles, pyrazoles and pyridazines.







Abstract
In this work, an universal synthetic approach for the synthesis of D2&#8208;labeled nitrogen heterocycles based on cycloaddition reactions of in&#8197;situ generated dideuteroacetylene is reported. A key feature of this method is the use of 1,4&#8208;dioxane as a deuterium&#8208;exchange&#8208;proof solvent, which allowed the access to dideuterosubstituted heterocycles in up to 99&#8201;% deuteration degree. The method was demonstrated to be suitable for the synthesis of D2&#8208;labeled triazoles, isoxazoles, pyrazoles and pyridazines.

         <title>Synthesis of Open&#8208;Cage Fullerenes with Pyrrole, Pyrrolone, Pyridinone, Iminofuran, and Pyranone Fragments Embedded on the Rim of the Orifice</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 41, Page 5694-5701, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The open&#8208;cage fullerene with a keto&#8208;lactone moiety reacted with aniline to form open&#8208;cage fullerenes with various functional groups on the rim of the expanded orifice. Decarbonylation and decarboxylation process took place under milder conditions compared to those for classical organic compounds. One water molecule could be trapped in the cavity of the new open&#8208;cage compounds as revealed by NMR and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data.







Abstract
An open&#8208;cage fullerene derivative with a pyranone and a diiminopentanone moiety was prepared. Further reaction with aniline could convert the pyranone moiety into a pyrrole moiety through the pyridinone moiety as an intermediate. During the process, decarboxylation and dehydroxylation aromatization reactions also took place on the diiminopentanone moiety and the two adjacent hydroxyl groups, thus forming iminofuran or pyrrolone moiety on the rim of the open&#8208;cage fullerene. Protonation experiment showed that the imino nitrogen atom on the rim of the orifice is more basic than the pyrrole nitrogen atom. The lone pair of the pyrrole nitrogen is partially conjugated with the &#960; system of the fullerene cage as shown by single crystal X&#8208;ray structures.

Abstract
Abstract: We describe a domino synthesis of 4&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrroles from aryl&#8208;substituted homopropargyl sulfonamides and aldehydes promoted by cheap and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle TsOH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O. The present reactions proceed through cyclocondensation of &#945;&#8208;sulfonamidoethyl&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;enone intermediates, which are formed by ring&#8208;cleavage of 3&#8208;acylpyrrolidines corresponding to aza&#8208;Prins cyclized intermediates. By controlling the conditions, 3&#8208;acylpyrrolidines can be obtained.

         <title>Synthesis and Fluorescence Mechanism of the Aminoimidazolone Analogues of the Green Fluorescent Protein: Towards Advanced Dyes with Enhanced Stokes Shift, Quantum Yield and Two&#8208;Photon Absorption</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 41, Page 5649-5660, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecularly hydrogen&#8208;bonded analogues of the green fluorescence protein chromophore with an aminoimidazole moiety were synthesised and characterised. The fluorescence mechanism and substituent effects were investigated in a combined experimental&#8208;computational approach, and a 279&#8208;fold improvement in the quantum yield was realised. The novel compounds exhibit promising two&#8208;photon fluorescence for bioimaging applications.







Abstract
Novel small&#8208;molecular analogues the green fluorescence protein (GFP) chromophore were synthesised to expand and improve this fluorophore family and to deepen the understanding of their fluorescence mechanism. The introduction of an aminophenyl substituent and the repositioning of the hydroxyl group, to enable strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding, not only enhanced fluorescence emission but also resulted in an increased Stokes shift and a considerable redshift. Experimental and computational results described dual fluorescence involving both excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer and internal charge transfer (ESIPT&#8208;ICT) mechanisms. Screening of the pH and the solvent medium revealed a complicated equilibrium involving hydrogen bonding, protonation and deprotonation that influences the absorption and emission spectra. Further improvement of the photophysical properties via the systematic variation of dialkylamino substituents at a single position of the chromophore led to a two&#8208;orders of magnitude enhancement in the quantum yields. In addition, the novel compounds also have significant two&#8208;photon absorption, which widens the possibilities for applications in the field of bioimaging.

         <title>Flexible Synthesis and Herbicidal Activity of Fully Substituted 3&#8208;Hydroxypyrazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 41, Page 5677-5684, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and herbicidal efficacy of a novel library of fully substituted 3&#8208;hydroxypyrazoles is reported. A final step diversification approach was employed to efficiently introduce various substituents in the 1&#8208; and 4&#8208;positions of the pyrazole. A scalable, multi&#8208;gram synthesis of the lead compound is also described.







Abstract
The synthesis and herbicidal efficacy of a novel library of fully substituted 3&#8208;hydroxypyrazoles is reported. An efficient, divergent approach to introduce phenyl, phenoxy, phenylsulfanyl, anilino and benzyl substituents in the 4&#8208;position of the pyrazole, alongside a flexible synthesis of N1&#8208;alkyl analogues is described via final step diversification of key intermediates. Herbicidal screening of the prepared compounds against key weed species identified the lead compound 2&#8208;[4&#8208;(2,4&#8208;difluorophenoxy)&#8208;1,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl]oxy&#8208;5&#8208;fluoropyrimidine, which was prepared on a multi&#8208;gram scale using an optimised synthetic route.

         <title>Syntheses of Optically Active V&#8208;Shaped Molecules: Relationship Between their Chiroptical Properties and the Orientation of the Stacked &#960;&#8208;Electron System</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 41, Page 5725-5731, November 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two kinds of optically active V&#8208;shaped molecules were synthesized from enantiopure [2.2]paracyclophane as chiral building blocks. Although the two molecules consisted of the same &#960;&#8208;electron system, the orientations of the stacked &#960;&#8208;electron systems were different. Circularly polarized luminescence behaviors could be controlled by adjusting their orientation.







Abstract
Two kinds of optically active V&#8208;shaped molecules were synthesized from enantiopure disubstituted and tetrasubstituted [2.2]paracyclophane as chiral building blocks. The p&#8208;arylene&#8208;ethynylene&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;electron systems in these species were stacked at an angle of 60&#176;, and although the two molecules consisted of the same &#960;&#8208;electron system, the orientations of these systems were different. In addition, their optical properties were almost identical, while in contrast, significant differences were observed between their chiroptical properties. It was therefore suggested that circularly polarized luminescence behavior could be controlled by adjusting the orientation of the stacked &#960;&#8208;electron systems.

The Cu&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of phenols with methylboronic acid provides a synthetic route to aryl methyl ethers, expanding the scope of Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam alkylation. The reaction proceeds under &#8220;open flask&#8221; conditions with no additional oxidant. Electron&#8208;deficient phenol derivatives are methylated in high yields, and some N&#8208;heterocycles are tolerated.







Abstract
A Cu&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of phenols with methylboronic acid to form aryl methyl ethers has been developed, expanding the scope of Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam alkylation. Electron&#8208;deficient phenol derivatives with a broad array of functional groups are methylated in high yields. Increased reaction temperature and catalyst loading enables the methylation of substrates incorporating pyridine and dihydroquinolone motifs. Electron&#8208;rich phenol derivatives are poor substrates for the methylation; the characterization of C&#8722;H homodimerization products formed from these substrates illuminates a competing mechanistic pathway.

         <title>Trapping experiments during reductive debrominations of aminotribromosilanes with alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:   In&#8208;situ  generated amido&#8208;substituted disilynes (SiMe  3  )  2  N&#8208;Si&#8801;Si&#8208;N(SiMe  3  )  2  1  and (SiMe  3  )DippN&#8208;Si&#8801;Si&#8208;N(SiMe  3  )Dipp  2  were observed upon the reductive dehalogenation of the tribromosilanes {N(SiMe  3  )  2  }SiBr  3  3  and {N(SiMe  3  )Dipp}SiBr  3  4  with Rieke magnesium (Mg*). Both disilynes were trapped with ethylene to yield the double [2+1] and [2+2] cycloaddition products  5  and  6  , respectively. The transient disilynes  1  and  2  were investigated with DFT calculations that revealed  1  to feature more triple bond character than  2  . The  in&#8208;situ  generated disilyne  2  was further quenched with 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene to yield the double [2+2] cycloaddition product  7  . In the presence of cyclooctatetraene, the reductive debromination of  4  with Mg* generates the bromo&#8208;substituted silacyclopentene  8  . This species was also isolated with 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene used as trapping reagent as the major product  9  , besides the side product  10  , that comprises two cyclotrisilene rings linked via a butene unit. The formation of  10  shows that a cyclotrisilene can occur as a side product during the reductive debromination of  4  in the presence of the alkene.</dc:description>

The  in-situ  generated disilyne  2  was further quenched with 1,5-cyclooctadiene to yield the double [2+2] cycloaddition product  7  . In the presence of cyclooctatetraene, the reductive debromination of  4  with Mg* generates the bromo-substituted silacyclopentene  8  . This species was also isolated with 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene used as trapping reagent as the major product  9  , besides the side product  10  , that comprises two cyclotrisilene rings linked via a butene unit. The formation of  10  shows that a cyclotrisilene can occur as a side product during the reductive debromination of  4  in the presence of the alkene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkynylsilanes are an important class of organic compounds, and dehydrogenative coupling of hydrosilanes with terminal alkynes provides a convenient and simple route to alkynylsilanes. On the other hand, calcium is an abundant, biocompatible and environmentally friendly element, and using of organocalcium complexes as catalytic reagents in organic synthesis recently attracted increasing attentions. Here we report organocalcium complex&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling of hydrosilanes with terminal alkynes. With a calcium alkyl complex [LCaCH  2  SiMe  3  ] (L = [MeC(NDipp)CHC(  t  Bu)NCH  2  CH  2  N(Me)CH  2  CH  2  NMe  2  ]  &#8722;  , Dipp = 2,6&#8208;(  i  Pr)  2  C  6  H  3  ) as the catalyst, the reactions of  n  &#8208;HexSiH  3  with terminal alkynes provide trialkynylsilanes and those of Et  2  SiH  2  with terminal alkynes give monoalkynylsilanes efficiently.</dc:description>

         <title>Borrowing Hydrogen and Acceptorless Dehydrogenative Coupling in the Multicomponent Synthesis of N&#8208;Heterocycles: A Comparison between Base and Noble Metal Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling reactions (ADC) and hydrogen transfer strategies (HT) provide a powerful tool in the multicomponent formation of  N&#8208;  heterocycles. A broad variety of complex products can be obtained starting from simple, cheap and commercially available reagents. The protocols are highly atom&#8208;efficient, as water, dihydrogen, or in some cases hydrogen peroxide, are the only by&#8208;products. Besides, in general neither further reducing or oxidizing agents, nor external hydrogen are required. Especially base metal&#8208;catalyzed strategies become ever more important. Therefore, in recent years, various different iron, cobalt, nickel and manganese catalysts have been developed. In this mini&#8208;review we want to highlight the progress that has been made using abundant metal complexes to promote multicomponent cyclizations for the formation of  N&#8208;  heterocycles and compare their capabilities with available noble metal catalyst systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Methods for Carbon&#8208;Fluorine Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Some illustrative examples of novel synthetic methodologies including organocatalytic processes, asymmetric syntheses or phase&#8208;transfer catalytic methods for the enantioselective incorporation of fluorine atom(s) into versatile molecular entities are covered in the current review, focusing on main contributions of the last decade.







Abstract
As a consequence of the ever&#8208;increasing relevance of fluorinated drugs in medicinal chemistry, organofluorine chemistry has become a hot topic research area during the last decade. Asymmetric carbon&#8208;fluorine bond&#8208;forming reactions have enormously developed in recent years with considerable findings related to novel reactions and synthetic approaches. These new synthetic efforts have contributed to the access to a growing number of fluorinated molecules and complex natural or synthetic products of high relevance in medicinal chemistry and drug research. Illustrative examples of novel synthetic methodologies, including organocatalytic processes, asymmetric syntheses or phase&#8208;transfer catalytic methods for the enantioselective incorporation of fluorine atom(s) into versatile molecular entities, are covered in the current Review, focusing on main contributions of the last ten years.

         <title>Synthesis of Polycyclic Indolines by Utilizing a Reduction/Cyclization Cascade Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facile and versatile protocols for the synthesis of diverse novel polycyclic indolines are presented. The dearomatizing cyclization of indoles (1 and 2) proceeds well under mild conditions. Alkaloids tryptanthrin and phaitanthrin C have been prepared by using this developed protocol.







Abstract
Subsequent reduction and dearomatizing cyclization reactions open up an entry into the synthesis of novel N&#8208;fused polycyclic indolines. The dearomatizing cyclization as key step of the sequence proceeds well with Cu(OTf)2 or TfOH as catalyst. At elevated temperature reduction of nitro&#8208;substituted precursors with iron under acidic conditions affords a broad variety of polycyclic indolines directly in a two&#8208;step cascade reaction in good to excellent yields. Using the developed protocol, the alkaloids tryptanthrin and phaitanthrin C have been prepared.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;Glycosyl Sulfones and their Application in One&#8208;Pot Julia Olefination for the Synthesis of exo&#8208;Glycals</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycosyl sulfones are important intermediates in the synthesis of various sugar derivatives. However, their 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;isomers have not been extensively studied because of lower availability. Herein, we report the highly stereoselective synthesis of heteroaryl&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosyl sulfones via glycosylation of heteroarylthiols and subsequent oxidation by magnesium monoperphthalate. One&#8208;pot Julia olefination using these 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosyl sulfones was also studied. It furnished thermodynamically less stable (E)&#8208;exo&#8208;glycals with  E/Z  selectivity of up to 91:9.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Decarbonylation of Aldehydes in the Total Synthesis of Natural Products</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decarbonylation is an invaluable reaction, utilized by nature and chemists alike. In different life forms, such as prokaryotes, plants and animals, this transformation is catalyzed by aldehyde decarbonylases. In the laboratory, the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed (TMC) decarbonylation, which was first achieved in 1959, is by and large the dominant way for conducting this reaction. The carbon&#8208;carbon bond cleavage is most often made possible by RhCl(PPh3)3 i.e. Wilkinson&#8217;s catalyst, but other metals are also used, both in academia and in industry. In this review, we chose to present the applications of TMC decarbonylation in the synthesis of natural products and their derivatives. More than 30 examples are showcased and categorized into three categories based on the essence of the role of the aldehyde group in the synthesis. A short outlook is given in the end, listing the different advantages and disadvantages of Wilkinson&#8217;s catalyst, as well as offering a brief prospect for the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Birch Reduction of Arenes as an Easy Entry to &#947;&#8208;Spirolactones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A convenient method for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;spirolactones in only 2&#8211;3 steps is described. Birch reduction of inexpensive and commercially available aromatic carboxylic acids in the presence of ethylene oxide affords hydroxy acids, which undergo direct lactonization during work&#8208;up. Suitable precursors are methyl&#8208;substituted benzoic acids, naphthoic, and dicarboxylic acids. Subsequent hydrogenation proceeds smoothly with Pd/C as catalyst and saturated &#947;&#8208;spirolactones are isolated in excellent yields and stereoselectivities. Thus, up to 3 new stereogenic centers can be constructed as sole diastereomers from achiral benzoic acids. Furthermore, it is possible to control the degree of saturation with Raney nickel or Wilkinson&#180;s catalyst to obtain products with 1 double bond. Overall, more than 30 new &#947;&#8208;spirolactones have been synthesized in analytically pure form.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Allylation of Cyclic and In Situ Formed N&#8208;Unsubstituted Imines with Tetraol&#8208;Protected Allylboronates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bench&#8208;stable and readily accessible allylboronates were utilized in fast and enantioselective allylation of cyclic aldimines and ketimines. The N&#8208;unsubstituted imine derived from benzaldehyde was generated in&#8197;situ and directly transformed with the allylation reagent &#8211; excess of ammonia was tolerated. All four homoallylic amines could be accessed selectively.







Abstract
Tetraol&#8208;protected &#945;&#8208;chiral allylboronates are utilized in diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective transformations of cyclic imines (up to 98&#8201;%, d.r. 97&#8201;:&#8201;3, e.r. 99&#8201;:&#8201;1). An application to in&#8197;situ formed N&#8208;unsubstituted imines gives in a consecutive one&#8208;pot sequence selective access to all four stereoisomers of the homoallylamine within minutes (up to 88&#8201;%, d.r. 81&#8201;:&#8201;19, e.r. 99&#8201;:&#8201;1). These results underline the usability, tuneability and stability of tetraol&#8208;based allylboronates.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Proving Syntheses of the Polyenoyltetramic Acids Pyranonigrin J and I</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The polyenoyltetramic acids pyranonigrin J (3) and py&#173;ranonigrin I (4) had been isolated from Aspergillus niger. Their or&#173;igins from and roles in biosynthesis as well as the S&#8208;con&#173;figura&#173;tions of their stereocenter had been deduced from expres&#173;sion ex&#173;periments with modifications of the corresponding gene cluster. We corroborated this stereochemical assignment after ex&#173;ecuting the first total syntheses of both compounds because they had es&#173;sentially the same specific rotations as their natural coun&#173;ter&#173;parts.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The polyenoyltetramic acids pyranonigrin J (3) and py&#173;ranonigrin I (4) had been isolated from Aspergillus niger. Their or&#173;igins from and roles in biosynthesis as well as the S-con&#173;figura&#173;tions of their stereocenter had been deduced from expres&#173;sion ex&#173;periments with modifications of the corresponding gene cluster. We corroborated this stereochemical assignment after ex&#173;ecuting the first total syntheses of both compounds because they had es&#173;sentially the same specific rotations as their natural coun&#173;ter&#173;parts.

         <title>Syntheses of 6,7&#8208;Benzotropolone Using Ring&#8208;Closing Metathesis Variants, Which Circumvent a Strongly Acidic Hydrolysis in the Sequel</title>

         <dc:description>A Wittig reaction of 3&#8208;hydroxyphtalide (11) gave ortho&#8208;sty&#173;rene&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid (12). Its Weinreb amide 13 acylated heterosub&#173;stituted methyllithiums. This led to aryl &#8220;methyl&#8221; ketones whose sp3&#8208;carbon was substituted by Cl + OMe (in 14a), 2 &#180; Cl (in 14b), OtBu (in 17a), SPh (in 17b) or SO2Ph (in 17c). The enolates of these ketones were C&#8208;allylated. This furnished the benzene&#8208;fused octa&#8208;1,8&#8208;dienones 7a&#8208;b and 9a&#8208;c, respectively. Ring&#8208;closing meta&#173;theses pro&#173;vided the corresponding benzocycloheptadienones 8a&#8208;b and 10a&#8208;c. Their ke&#173;tone moieties were a,a&#8208;disubstituted (in 8a&#8208;b) or a&#8208;monosub&#173;stituted (in 10a&#8208;c). Each substitution pattern allowed to generate the hydroxy&#173;enone&#160; motif of the corresponding benzocyclo&#173;heptatrienone &#8208; or 6,7&#8208;benzotropolone &#8208; 6a: The MeO&#8208; and PhS&#8208;con&#173;tain&#173;ing benzo&#173;cy&#173;clohep&#173;tadienone 8a gave 6,7&#8208;benztropo&#173;lone methyl ether (15) by sulf&#173;oxide formation and pyrolysis; 15 was demethyl&#173;ated with BCl3.

The PhSO2&#8208;containing substrate 10c was deprotonated where&#173;upon an ox&#173;idation with Me3Si&#8208;O&#8208;O&#8208;SiMe3 gave 6,7&#8208;benzotrop&#173;olone (6a).</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Homodiarylation of Vinyl Esters in Aqueous Medium</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A palladium&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;diarylation of vinyl esters with arylbornic acids in water has been developed. This newly elaborated protocol features good functional group tolerance and provides one&#8208;step access to 1,2&#8208;diaryletahol derivatives under mild reaction conditions. The presented reaction can be carried out in water smoothly without the addition of any ligands at ambient temperature what makes this procedure environmentally benign. The transformation occurs within a single catalytic cycle and is feasible due to the modification of transition metal catalytic activity through the influence of &#960;&#8208;acceptor olefin (benzoquinone) as well as water as a medium. Moreover, the protocol allows to generate entire compounds libraries (highly profitable in medicinal chemistry) and utilizes sustainable arylboronic acid as coupling partners under mild conditions. It is also noted that the structure of boron moiety has a great impact on the selectivity of the reaction, the application of sterically hindered esters of arylboronic acids influences the reaction course towards various substituted stilbenes.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In a first instance, the effect of the microwave irradiation on the 1,3&#8208;Dioxa&#8208;[3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of aryl allylic carbamates was investigated. Under these new conditions, the reaction acceleration was clearly highlighted compared to conventional heating conditions. Depending on the electronic nature of substituents on the aromatic group, this type of rearrangement can be&#160; faster with similar or improved yields. Due to this experimental improvement, the diversity of aryl allylic carbamates able to undergo this rearrangement in a reasonable reaction time (30 min.) and with acceptable to high yields was greatly extended. Finally, an original synthetic way involving this microwave&#8208;assisted process to access new six&#8208;membered heterocyclic structures such as (  E  )&#8208;5&#8208;arylidene&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazinane&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones was developed from Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) adducts showing the interest of this molecular rearrangement approach. DFT and Fragment Distortion studies showed in general polar transition structures and connected high deformation and interaction energies with lower activation barriers.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Shape and Synthesis of Extended Fluorenones: Recent Advances and Upcoming Challenges</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extended fluorenones represent a particular class of polycyclic compounds. The extension of the aromatic system through the fusion of additional benzene rings onto the central tricyclic fluorenone gives rise to an impressive topological diversity and allows to modulate the properties of the original molecule. The multiple ways this aromatic extension can be joined onto the tricyclic core generates multiple spatial arrangements from linear, angular, mixed linear&#8208;angular, to helical. This extensive range of shapes and their subsequent applications has piqued the curiosity of the scientific community, who now creatively compete to develop selective and direct routes to these valuable molecular architectures. Potential applications of these diverse domains have also driven the development of strategies for the installation of various substituents at selected sites of the carbon backbone. This review intends to provide the reader with an up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of the methods for constructing extended fluorenones and their properties.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The fragmentation mechanisms leading to the formation of several pronounced fragment ions formed during EI mass spectrometry of the diterpene hydrocarbons polytrichastrene A and wanju&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene were investigated by isotopic labelling experiments. All twenty singly  13  C&#8208;labelled isotopomers of these diterpenes were enzymatically synthesised from the twenty isotopomers of (  13  C)geranylgeranyl diphosphate using the polytrichastrene synthase from  Chryseobacterium polytrichastri  .

         <title>The concept of photozymes: Short peptides with photoredox catalytic activity for nucleophilic additions to &#945;&#8208;phenyl styrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional photoredox catalytic additions of alcohols to olefins require additives, like thiophenol, to promote back electron transfer. The concept of &#8220;photozymes&#8221; assumes that forward and backward electron transfer steps in a photoredox catalytic cycle are controllable by substrate binding to photocatalytically active peptides. Accordingly, we synthesized a short tripeptide modified with 1,7&#8208;dicyano&#8208;perylene&#8208;3,4:9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid bisimide as photoredox catalyst. This peptide undergoes an unconventional photoredox catalytic cycle with the radical anion and dianion of the perylene bisimide&#8208;peptide as intermediates. The photoredox catalytic reactions with &#945;&#8208;phenyl styrenes as substrates require remarkably low catalyst loadings (0.5 mol%) and give the methoxylation products in high yields. The concept of &#8220;photozymes&#8221; for photoredox catalysis has significant potential for other photocatalytic reactions, in particular with respect to enantioselective photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Access to Unique C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;Acyl Modified Nucleosides through Liebeskind&#8211;Srogl Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient palladium/CuTC cocatalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction procedure for the synthesis of C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;acyl nucleosides from the corresponding nucleoside 5&#8242;&#8208;carbothioates and boronic acids is described. The procedure is fast, efficient, and it tolerates a wide variety of functionalities, thus expanding the so far limited chemical methods for C&#8208;5&#8217; diversification of deoxy&#8208; and ribonucleosides.







Abstract
The chemical functionalization at C&#8208;5&#8217; position of nucleosides has been significantly less studied compared to the C&#8208;1&#8217;, C&#8208;2&#8217; and C&#8208;3&#8217; sugar positions in spite of its potential important role for biological activity. We describe here the synthesis of new carbothioate nucleosides which were then engaged in a Liebeskind&#8208;Srogl reaction with various boronic acids for the preparation of diversely modified C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;acyl nucleosides. Applied to pyrimidine nucleosides in the DNA and RNA series, the reaction showed a broad substrate scope and more than 25 examples were synthesized in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent isolated yields. This general and efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed and Cu(I)&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;coupling represents a convenient method to prepare a diverse set of 5&#8217;&#8208;modified nucleosides and paves the way for further transformation into a variety of potentially bioactive compounds via the possible conversion of the C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;ketone.

         <title>Continuous Flow Synthesis of Sulfur&#8208; and Selenium&#8208;NHC Compounds (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first continuous flow syntheses of sulfur&#8208; and selenium&#8208;NHC (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) adducts in unprecedented short reaction times and high yields are reported. The importance of these species in coordination chemistry or as efficient tools for determining the &#960;&#8208;acceptor character of NHC ligands make any improvement in their synthesis a worthy goal. Thiourea derivatives bearing both saturated and unsaturated NHCs were obtained using NEt  3  as a weak base (homogeneous setup) in conjunction with a bed of elemental sulfur (S  8  ). The synthetic route proving optimum for selenoureas involves the use of a simple Se/K  2  CO  3  heterogeneous microreactor design.</dc:description>

         <title>Ring&#8208;Closing C&#8208;O/C&#8208;O Metathesis of Aliphatic Ethers and Esterification of Terpene Alcohols Catalyzed by Functionalized Biochar</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalized biochars, renewable carbon materials prepared from waste biomass, can catalyze transformations of a range of oxygen&#8208;containing substrates via hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. Good conversions (up to 75.2%) to different O&#8208;heterocycles are obtained from ring&#8208;closing C&#8208;O/C&#8208;O metathesis reactions of different aliphatic ethers under optimized conditions using this heterogeneous, metal&#8208;free, and easy separable catalyst. The diversity in the sorts of O&#8208;containing feedstocks is further demonstrated by the utilization of functionalized biochar to promote the esterification of terpene alcohols, an important reaction in food and flavor industries. Under the optimized conditions, full conversions to various terpene esters are obtained. Moreover, both of the reactions studied herein are performed under neat conditions, thus increasing the overall sustainability of the process described.</dc:description>

         <title>General Construction of Thioamides under Mild Conditions: A Stepwise Proton Transfer Process Mediated by EDTA</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general and clean method for one&#8208;pot synthesis of thioamides was investigated using a combination of experiments and quantum chemical calculations. Ester, amide, and elemental sulfur were employed as the starting materials and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) as the catalyst, and a benign process was thus afforded. Both alkyl and aryl thioamides with various functional groups were obtained in moderate to good yields. Neither transition metals nor external oxidants were required in the reaction. The catalytic performance of EDTA originates from a stepwise, proton transfer process in which EDTA transports a proton from the benzyl carbon to a sulfur atom. Such a process is concerted by discrete charge transfer such that the associated barrier gets lowered.</dc:description>

The obtained derivatives present additional functional groups, such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, or carbon&#8208;carbon triple bond, linked to the amino acid core through a flexible  C  1  or  C  2  alkyl fragment.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Mitsunobu Protocol to Access Ketene S,S&#8208;/N,S&#8208;Acetals at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With unique chemical reactivity, &#945;&#8208;oxoketene S,S&#8208; and N,S&#8208;acetals have attracted enormous attention in the past decades, whereas limited reports exist for their synthesis via eco&#8208;compatible protocol. Herein, we develop the one&#8208;pot protocol for symmetrical and unsymmetrical &#945;&#8208;oxoketene S,S&#8208;/N,S&#8208;acetals through chemoselective alkylation of &#945;&#8208;enolic dithioesters using Mitsunobu chemistry at room temperature. The operationally and user simple mild protocol tolerates a wide range of alcohols and &#945;&#8208;enolic dithioesters/&#946;&#8208;ketothioamides. Short reaction time, good yields, highly selective C&#8722;S functionalization, and E/Z&#8208;stereoselectivity are imperative characteristics of this strategy.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bisthienylethene (BTE) class is one of the most intensely type of photochromatic dye which attract great attention from researchers seeking to exploit light responsive switches in an extensive diversity of fields. BTE is the subject of many avenues of research. We report here the synthesis of a new diaryletheneporphyrin photoswitchable copolymer via the electropolymerization of zinc octaethyl porphyrin and pyridine substituted diarylethene. The electropolymerization was monitored by electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM). The copolymer was characterized by electrochemistry, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The incorporated diarylethene maintains its reversible photochromism upon the UV&#8208;Vis radiation with multiple cycles of ring&#8208;opening and closing. Attention is focused on the ways the polymer environment affects BTE photochromism.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A complete computational study has been performed in order to rationalise the results of a new organocatalytic approach to the kinetic resolution of 4&#8208; substituted oxazinones which results in highly enantioenriched and orthogonally&#8208;protected &#946;&#8208;amino acids. DFT&#8208;analysis elucidated the preferable binding orientation of the 4&#8208;oxazinone under study, predicted the formation of the observed major  R  product with a calculated  ee  in good agreement with the experimental data and allowed a complete mechanistic and stereochemical understanding of the catalysis.

         <title>Quantification of the Lewis Basicities and Nucleophilicities of 1,3,5&#8208;Tris(dialkylamino)benzenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Equilibrium constants for the formation of 3xy have been determined photometrically. The Lewis basicity of the ring carbons trend is: trimorpholinobenzene 1a&lt;tripiperidinobenzene 1b&lt;tripyrrolidinobenzene 1c; nucleophilicity parameters are in the range 10&lt;N&lt;15. Some complexes show temperature&#8208;dependent NMR spectra, due to rapid reverse reaction and recombination at different positions of the ring. DFT calculations agree with experimental data.







Abstract
Equilibrium constants for the formation of Wheland complexes from 1,3,5&#8208;tris(dialkylamino)benzenes and benzhydrylium ions (Ar2CH+) have been determined photometrically in dichloromethane solution at 20&#8201;&#176;C. The Lewis basicity of the ring carbons increases in the series trimorpholinobenzene&lt;tripiperidinobenzene&lt;tripyrrolidinobenzene. Wheland complexes, which are formed with equilibrium constants 102&lt;K/M&#8722;1&lt;106 in the reactions of triaminobenzenes with carbenium ions, show temperature&#8208;dependent dynamic 1H NMR spectra, due to rapid reverse reactions and recombination at different positions of the triaminobenzenes. Since the rates of the formation of the Wheland complexes are too high to be measured directly, they were calculated as the product of photometrically determined equilibrium constants and the rate constants for the reverse reactions, which were derived from the dynamic 1H NMR spectra. The experimentally determined equilibrium and rate constants were in good agreement with the results of DFT calculations using the SMD solvent model. The calculations show that in all cases the Wheland complexes are thermodynamically more stable than the ammonium ions formed by attack of the benzhydrylium ions at the amino group of the title compounds, which explains the exclusive formation of Wheland complexes in thermodynamically controlled reactions. With nucleophilicity parameters in the range 10&lt;N&lt;15 the triaminobenzenes have comparable nucleophilic reactivities as enamines, silyl ketene acetals as well as stabilized phosphonium and sulfonium ylides.

         <title>Understanding the Alkylation Mechanism of 3&#8208;Chloropiperidines &#8211; NMR Kinetic Studies and Isolation of Bicyclic Aziridinium Ions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this research, we analyzed the alkylation mechanism of 3&#8208;chloropiperidnes by isolation of the proposed intermediate aziridinium ions and NMR kinetic investigations. The bicyclic structure of these predicted intermediates was confirmed by single crystal XRD, while the kinetic analysis revealed remarkable reactivity differences between the gem&#8208;methylated compounds and their corresponding non&#8208;methylated analogues.







Abstract
The present study describes the kinetic analysis of the 3&#8208;chloropiperidine alkylation mechanism. These nitrogen mustard&#8208;based compounds are expected to react via a highly electrophilic bicyclic aziridinium ion, which is readily attacked by nucleophiles. Halide abstraction using silver salts with weakly coordinating anions lead to the isolation of these proposed intermediates, whereas their structure was confirmed by single crystal XRD. Kinetic studies of the aziridinium ions also revealed notable reactivity differences of the C5 gem&#8208;methylated compounds and their unmethylated counterparts. The observed reactivity trends were also reflected by NMR studies in aqueous solution and DNA alkylation experiments of the related 3&#8208;chloropiperidines. Therefore, the underlying Thorpe&#8208;Ingold effect might be considered as another option to adjust the alkylation activity of these compounds.

&lt;p&gt;In this research, we analyzed the alkylation mechanism of 3-chloropiperidnes by isolation of the proposed intermediate aziridinium ions and NMR kinetic investigations. The bicyclic structure of these predicted intermediates was confirmed by single crystal XRD, while the kinetic analysis revealed remarkable reactivity differences between the gem-methylated compounds and their corresponding non-methylated analogues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present study describes the kinetic analysis of the 3-chloropiperidine alkylation mechanism. These nitrogen mustard-based compounds are expected to react via a highly electrophilic bicyclic aziridinium ion, which is readily attacked by nucleophiles. Halide abstraction using silver salts with weakly coordinating anions lead to the isolation of these proposed intermediates, whereas their structure was confirmed by single crystal XRD. Kinetic studies of the aziridinium ions also revealed notable reactivity differences of the C5 gem-methylated compounds and their unmethylated counterparts. The observed reactivity trends were also reflected by NMR studies in aqueous solution and DNA alkylation experiments of the related 3-chloropiperidines. Therefore, the underlying Thorpe-Ingold effect might be considered as another option to adjust the alkylation activity of these compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>n&#8208;Butanol: An Ecologically and Economically Viable Extraction Solvent for Isolating Polar Products from Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water is the green solvent of choice for many reactions, but it can be challenging to extract polar compounds from aqueous solution. This problem can often be addressed with n&#8208;butanol, which can be produced sustainably from biomass. The wet n&#8208;butanol phase is a nanomaterial where polar compounds can be accommodated in inverse micelles of water. Ways to determine a priori whether n&#8208;butanol is a suitable extractant are also discussed.







Abstract
Water is the solvent of choice in terms of greenness and sustainability. However, it can be difficult to isolate very polar products from water. Here, we discuss the use of n&#8208;butanol as a solvent to extract polar compounds from aqueous solution. n&#8208;Butanol produces high yields and can also be sourced sustainably from biomass, which makes it attractive from a climate perspective. The reason for its high efficiency is that the wet n&#8208;butanol phase is a nanomaterial that incorporates little pockets of water that can stabilize the polar solute. Thus, the environment remains very water&#8208;like, and the presence of hydrophobic groups can tip the equilibrium towards the n&#8208;butanol phase. We also discuss a simple estimate whether n&#8208;butanol will be an efficient extraction solvent for the compound of interest based on common public databases. This should help to guide practicing organic chemists during the solvent selection process.

         <title>Combining Diastereomeric Resolution and Viedma Ripening by Using a Racemic Resolving Agent</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combination of diastereomeric resolution with Viedma ripening achieves a single stereoisomeric salt from racemic mixtures of two compounds. The process allows for higher yield of the product in comparison with traditional diastereomeric resolution while using a lower&#8208;cost racemic mixture of the resolving agent. The successful example is demonstrated using a racemic conglomerate salt of rac&#8208;2&#8208;phenylglycinamide with rac&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl tryptophan.







Abstract
In spite of the many resolution techniques available to separate enantiomers, diastereomeric resolution still remains the most widely used technique in industry. However, drawbacks of this technique are the limited yield of the desired enantiomer and the expensive enantiopure resolving agent that is required. We show here for the first time that a combination of diastereomeric resolution with Viedma ripening using a racemic resolving agent can also provide a single stereoisomer when using an excess of the racemic resolving agent, without the need for the resolving agent to racemize. The requirements of this process are, like for an enantiomeric system, that the compound crystallizes as a racemic conglomerate and that at least one chiral center in the target molecule is racemizable. In addition, owing to the presence of the racemization reaction, substantial improvement in the yield can be obtained. We here demonstrate this approach using a metastable conglomerate salt of rac&#8208;2&#8208;phenylglycinamide with rac&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl tryptophan.

         <title>Structure&#8208;performance guided design of sustainable plasticizers from bio&#8208;renewable feedstocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The search for more sustainable solutions for plastics production, moving away from petrochemical feedstocks as today&#180;s major raw material basis, is a research area of increasing interest. This task goes far beyond the issue of designing greener polymers as tailor&#8208;made plastics require further components. One of such necessary components for many applications are plasticizers, and a major application of them is related to polyvinyl chloride (PVC). In this contribution, we report the synthesis and technical evaluation of alternative, novel bicyclic plasticizer candidates, which are fully accessible from renewable feedstocks. In detail, these molecules are based on the use of the 2&#8208;methylfuran, maleic anhydride and 2&#8208;ethylhexanol as bio&#8208;based starting materials. The synthetic concept consists of an initial Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with 2&#8208;methylfuran and a subsequent hydrogenation and optional esterification step. The applied reactions are well&#8208;known as economic and sustainable technologies. Thus, not only the starting materials (being of bio&#8208;based origin) but also the selected reaction technologies for the syntheses of the target molecules are sustainable. Furthermore, a range of performance tests enabled an insight into structure&#8208;performance relationships and revealed promising plasticizing properties of this new bio&#8208;based plasticizer generation with, e.g., an attractive solution temperature fulfilling the criterium for a &#8220;fast fuser&#8221; as well as good compatibility with PVC.</dc:description>

         <title>From Enantioenriched Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropylcarbinols to Axially Chiral Arylnaphthalenes via Aryldihydronaphthalenes: Central&#8208;to&#8208;Axial Chirality Exchange</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transformations of enantioenriched donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) cyclopropylcarbinols to enantioenriched 1&#8208;arylnaphthalenes that bear an&#160; ortho &#8208;substituent on a benzene ring provided a successful chirality&#8208;exchange method with a high level of stereoinduction. A central&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality&#8208;transfer step, i.e., a Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening cyclization of enantioenriched D&#8211;A cyclopropylcarbinols (97 to &gt;99% ee), afforded 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes with an&#160; ortho &#8208;substituent (Me, Br, OMe, OBn, or OiPr) on the benzene ring with high enantioselectivity (97 to &gt;99% ee). The central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality&#8208;exchange step, i.e., the dehydrogenation of the obtained enantioenriched 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes using DDQ, furnished the axially chiral 1&#8208;arylnaphthalenes with high enantioselectivity (97 to &gt;99% ee). Importantly, we developed a highly enantioselective synthesis of&#160;a 1&#8208;arylnaphthalene with an&#160; ortho &#8208;alkoxy group on the benzene ring.&#160;Moreover,&#160;we improved the chirality exchange to furnish a 1&#8208;arylnaphthalene with an&#160; ortho &#173;&#8211;alkoxy&#8208;substituted benzene ring in high yield with high ee.&#160; In addition, we also elucidated the reaction mechanism based on the determination of the absolute configuration, spectral data using NOE, and theoretical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Phenanthropiperidine Alkaloids by Sequential Alkylation of N,N&#8208;Dibenzylaminoacetonitrile</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two representative members of the phenanthropiperidine alkaloid family, tylophorine (  1  ) and cryptopleurine (  2  ), were synthesized by a bidirectional alkylation strategy employing dibenzylaminoacetonitrile as a substrate. This approach relies on the unprecedented condensation of metallated &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles with bromomethylphenanthrenes to provide fully substituted &#945;aminonitriles that are submitted to a NaBH  4  &#8208;mediated reductive decyanation process to form homobenzylic amines. From these intermediates, a terminal leaving group was introduced by simple chemical manipulation, and its displacement by a free primary amine under two favourable cyclization processes led to the formation of the future E&#8208;ring of both alkaloids in high yields. Finally, a late Pictet&#8211; Spengler cyclization ensured the formation of a D&#8208;ring for the alkaloids  1  and  2  .</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Submonomer synthesis in solution and block&#8208;coupling protocols were combined to prepare amphiphilic peptoid hexamers. The amphipathic character arises from the use of hydrophobic aliphatic  tert  &#8208;butyl side&#8208;chains imposing the  cis  &#8208;amide backbone conformation and various cationic side&#8208;chains periodically introduced each three residues. Evaluation of the effect on Gram positive and Gram negative bacterial strains as well as the capacity to impair biofilm formation and the toxicity of one selected compound allowed to highlight the potential of a short constrained peptoid carrying triazolium&#8208;type cationic pendant groups.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>N2&#8208;Sulfonyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazo amidines can be synthesized by the reaction of electron rich alkynyl amines with electron poor sulfonyl azides through 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions that proceed with perfect regioselectivity. In the presence of rhodium(II) carboxylate catalysts denitrogenation occurs to give the corresponding metallocarbenes. Then, there is a competition between 1,2&#8211;H shift and O&#8208;transfer from the sulfonyl group to the metallocarbene center. Using an electron poor nitrobenzenesulfonyl group and large carboxylate rhodium ligands gives complete selectivity for 1,2&#8211;H shift, forming &#945;,&#946;&#8209;unsaturated&#8208;diazo amidines in high yield and excellent Z&#8209;selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of Sugar Amino Acids: Flow chemistry used for &#945;/&#946;&#8208;chimera synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two ring size &#946;&#8208;Sugar Amino Acids, &#946;SAAs, Fmoc&#8208;RibAFU(ip)&#8208;OH and Fmoc&#8208;GlcAPU(Me,Bn)&#8208;OH, as Lego&#8208;elements are introduced to make &#945;/&#946;&#8208;chimera peptides by flow&#8208;based solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). Their synthesis alongside selected &#945;&#8208;amino acids, &#945;AA, is fine&#8208;tuned. The recently published 50% TFA cleavage protocol of tBu protected shorter (Ser, Asp) and larger aromatic (Tyr, Trp), with bulky side chain protected Arg(Pbf) and Gln(Trt) residues were probed. We found that this milder condition is sufficient to successfully remove both the 1,2&#8208;  O  &#8208;isopropylidene from RibAFU(ip) and tBu, Pbf and Trt from the other &#945;AA residues, but to preserve the 2,3&#8208;di&#8208;  O  &#8208;benzyl protection of GlcAPU(Me,Bn). Note that  O  &#8208;benzyl groups can be subsequently cleaved by HF or catalytic hydrogenation. Tuned protocols allow the efficient synthesis of 16&#8208;mer penetratin analogues  via  continuous flow conditions incorporating either RibAFU(ip) or GlcAPU(Me,Bn) &#946;SAAs. Both acid concentration (50%/95%) and type (TFA/HF) allow a versatile protecting group removal and thus, to fine&#8208;tune the hydrophilicity and aromaticity of the above building blocks in chimera constructs.</dc:description>

Tuned protocols allow the efficient synthesis of 16-mer penetratin analogues  via  continuous flow conditions incorporating either RibAFU(ip) or GlcAPU(Me,Bn) &#946;SAAs. Both acid concentration (50%/95%) and type (TFA/HF) allow a versatile protecting group removal and thus, to fine-tune the hydrophilicity and aromaticity of the above building blocks in chimera constructs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discrepancy Regarding the Dethreading of a Dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 Macrocycle through a Perfluorobutyl End in [2]Pseudorotaxanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and dethreading study of DB24C8&#8208;based pseudorotaxanes are reported. The pseudorotaxane axles contain ammonium and carbamate stations as well as a repulsive nonafluorobutyl group as one of the two extremities. This extremity prevents any threading of the DB24C8. However, dethreading of pseudorotaxanes is possible and the kinetic rate depends on the presence and localization in the encircled axle of secondary sites of interactions (carbamates).







Abstract
Here are reported the synthesis and characterization of four new dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8)&#8208;based ammonium&#8208;containing pseudorotaxanes, for which one of the two encircled axle's extremities consists of a perfluorobutyl moiety. The subsequent dethreading of the DB24C8 over the perfluorobutyl extremity was studied. Although the perfluorobutyl extremity of an ammonium&#8208;containing axle did not allow threading of DB24C8, dethreading of a perfluorobutyl extremity&#8208;containing pseudorotaxane was possible and its rate depended on both the strength of the template&#8208;to&#8208;DB24C8 complex and the nature of the axle. In particular, dethreading process may be assisted by the presence, in the threaded axle, of a poor secondary site of interaction for the DB24C8 and this assistance proved to be higher when this site is close to the DB24C8.

         <title>Porous Organic Compounds &#8211; Small Pores on the Rise</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Make small great again. This Minireview focuses on smaller porous organic cages and other porous organic compounds, such as trianglimines and cyclobenzoins. Control over the intrinsic nanopore by organic synthesis and the gas sorption properties of smaller intrinsic pores showcase why size does matter and why small is the new big.







Abstract
Porous materials are important for various energy&#8208;related technologies such as catalysis and separation. While porous organic cage compounds are a rather recent addition to the field of porous materials, these discrete nanocavities have since emerged as a versatile functional&#8208;materials platform, facilitated by the solubility of the materials in common organic solvents. In contrast to other frameworks, organic cages are assembled first from modular building blocks in solution and then packed in the solid&#8208;state in a next step. In this minireview, we highlight examples of porous organic cages with focus on how the intrinsic nanopore can be controlled and utilized, especially focusing on their synthesis and the gas sorption properties of smaller intrinsic pores of porous organic cage compounds, porous macrocycles, and other related compounds.

         <title>Synthesis of Adamantyl H&#8208;Phosphinate Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein described several methods for the preparation of 1&#8208;adamantyl H&#8208;phosphinate esters. Either H&#8208;phosphinic acids are esterified with 1&#8208;adamantanol, or adamantyl hypophosphite reacts through phosphorus&#8208;carbon bond&#8208;formation. Adamantyl esters are significantly less reactive than their primary or secondary alkyl counterparts.







Abstract
Adamantyl H&#8208;phosphinate esters have been described by Leclaire, Giordano, and coworkers as &#8220;universal precursors of P&#8208;stereogenic compounds&#8221; after resolution by chiral HPLC, because these esters resist racemization during displacement with organometallics. In that work, the racemic esters were prepared from phosphorus trichloride or dichlorophosphines (RPCl2). We decided to investigate alternative methods for the preparation of these important precursors. Esterification methods included EDC, PivCl, and T3P. A protocol to avoid chromatographic purification was also developed and used for multigram&#8208;scale synthesis. Finally, adamantyl hypophosphite 1&#8208;AdOP(O)H2 was also prepared and used in the synthesis adamantyl H&#8208;phosphinate esters, thereby providing an alternative to the esterification of H&#8208;phosphinic acids, although 1&#8208;AdOP(O)H2 was much less reactive than other hypophosphite esters.

         <title>Construction of benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles by epoxide &#8211; heteronucleophile cyclization: applications in the synthesis of natural products and designed molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Construction of benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles, specifically which have one or more sp  3  stereogenic carbon atoms on the heterocyclic ring, by intramolecular ring&#8208;opening cyclization of epoxides with  O  &#8208; and  N  &#8208;nucleophiles is a powerful synthetic tool in organic synthesis. In this review, we analyze the efficiency of such a heterocyclization approach in natural product synthesis and synthetic methodologies published since the year 2000. In addition to briefly discussing the synthetic methods of accessing the requisite epoxide substrates, important aspects of the subsequent cyclization reaction, such as reaction conditions,  endo  &#8208; versus  exo  &#8208;regioselectivity, protecting or functional group compatibility, and enantio&#8208; and distereoselectivity are analysed. Noteworthy is that although the literature of organic chemistry in the last four decades has witnessed a large number of reviews/book chapters on epoxide ring&#8208;opening chemistry, this is the first time that the current topic is systematized as a dedicated review.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of Enantiopure HMPA Analogs in Samarium&#8208;Diiodide&#8208;Promoted Dearomatizations of N&#8208;Acylated Indole Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Among several chiral (S)&#8208;proline&#8208;based HMPA analogs, the shown ligand strongly activates samarium diiodide allowing the very fast and efficient conversion of an N&#8208;acylated indole into an indoline derivative. So far the achieved enantioselectivity is at best moderate.







Abstract
A series of (S)&#8208;proline&#8208;based enantiopure phosphorus triamide derivatives were prepared and evaluated as HMPA alternative in samarium diiodide cyclization reactions of N&#8208;acylated indole derivatives. The expected tricyclic indoline derivatives were generally obtained in good to excellent yields, however, the induced enantioselectivities were at best moderate. In our model reaction, the phosphorus triamide derivative with a (dimethyl)hydroxymethyl group at the stereogenic center provided the cyclization product in almost quantitative yield and with an enantiomeric excess of approximately 24&#8201;%. No separate proton source is required by applying this chiral Lewis base which was recovered in 93&#8201;% yield. Bulkier substituents at the stereogenic center did not furnish improved results. Although in our preliminary study only low to moderate enantioselectivities could be achieved, the observed fast conversions and the high yields demonstrate the basic suitability of chiral pyrrolidine&#8208;based phosphoramide Lewis bases in samarium(II)&#8208;induced reactions.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Maleimides and succinimides are all vital scaffolds in biological fields and various natural products. Maleimide derivatives have been extensively used as coupling partners for various organic transformations, affording a broad array of important molecular architectures including succinimides. In the past decade, a variety of efficient chelation&#8208;assisted strategies have been employed for the selective addition of C&#8208;H bonds to maleimides giving succinimides, which are also highly important building blocks in organic synthesis. This review provides an overview of research progress relating to maleimides participated transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed group&#8208;directed C&#8208;H alkylation from 2012 to 2021. Significant advances in this field were highlighted, diverse transition metal catalysts, organic substrates contained different directing groups, reaction mechanisms, as well as synthetic applications were systematically discussed. In addition, the limitations and intractable issues need to be solved in the future were also pointed out.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general and efficient intramolecular halo&#8208;amination of unactivated alkenes for the synthesis of various halogenated N &#8208;heterocycles was developed via electrochemical anodic oxidation. This protocol proceeds in a simple undivided cell by employing LiI or LiBr as redox mediums and halogen sources. A wide range of halogenated N &#8208;heterocycles, including three&#8208;, five&#8208;, and six&#8208;membered N &#8208;heterocycles were constructed in moderate to good yields at room temperature. Notably, this electrochemical oxidative transformation avoids the utilization of external oxidants and strong bases, therefore represents an environmentally benign approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroformylation of Alkenes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of the field of the Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation of alkenes and alkynes, from the seminal studies up to the current state of the art, remaining challenges, different mechanistic proposals involving unusual features as well as unique synthetic opportunities inaccessible with conventional Rh&#8208;catalysis, are discussed.







Abstract
Hydroformylation of alkenes and alkynes with syngas represents a method of choice to furnish valuable aldehydes with the 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;economy from readily available building blocks. The field is dominated by Rh&#8208; and Co&#8208;catalysis; however, complexes of many other metals were also shown to be catalytically competent. Here we review the studies of hydroformylation under Pd&#8208;catalysis, starting from the seminal reports up to the most recent examples. Special emphasis is paid to the unique regio&#8208; and chemoselectivities of Pd&#8208;based methods, which are difficult to achieve with the conventional hydroformylation protocols. Different mechanistic proposals are presented along with a summary of their experimental and computational support. Finally, the user&#8208;friendly methods using surrogates of syngas are discussed as well. Overall, the Minireview aims to present unique opportunities and remaining challenges of Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation reactions for their prospective applications in fine&#8208;chemical synthesis.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free and syn&#8208;Selective Hydrohalogenation of Alkynes through a Pseudo&#8208;Intramolecular Process</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alkyne moiety of ethynylaniline efficiently underwent metal&#8208;free and syn&#8208;selective hydrochlorination upon heating with hydrochloric acid through a pseudo&#8208;intramolecular process. This reaction is initiated by formation of anilinium salt, which facilitates the efficient electrophilic addition because of the spatial proximity of the reagents. In this reaction, overaddition is not observed.







Abstract
A new metal&#8208;free hydrohalogenation method for alkynes has been developed, which proceeds through a pseudo&#8208;intramolecular process. In this reaction, ethynylaniline serves as a substrate to quantitatively form an anilinium salt upon treatment with hydrochloric acid. The spatial proximity facilitates the efficient electrophilic addition of HCl to the ethynyl group in syn&#8208;mode, affording the corresponding chloroalkene without overaddition. This protocol was applied to HBr and HI, and the corresponding bromo&#8208; and iodoalkenes were obtained, respectively. The obtained chloroalkene was converted to tri&#8208;substituted alkenes possessing different aryl/alkynyl groups through Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

         <title>Further investigation of the 2&#8208;azido&#8208;phenylselenylation of glycals</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Derivatives of 2&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;deoxysugars are widely applied as precursor of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxysugars in the synthesis of various oligosaccharides of bacterial, fungal and mammalian origin. Heterogeneous or homogeneous azidophenylselenylation (APS) of glycals,  i.e., reaction of glycals with Ph2S2, PhI(OAc)2  and NaN3  or TMSN3  as azide radical donors, is a straightforward way to phenyl 2&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;1&#8208;selenoglycosides that can be directly used as glycosyl donors. However, heterogeneous APS is characterized by insufficient reproducibility and scalability. We have studied the effect of reaction conditions on the product distribution in heterogeneous APS of 3,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;d&#8208;galactal and found the conditions that enabled reliable preparation of crystalline phenyl 2&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;1&#8208;seleno&#8208;&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;galactopyranoside triacetate in yields of about 58% on the 3.7 mmol scale. APS of 3,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;d&#8208;glucal under those conditions produced a ~1:1 mixture of phenyl 2&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;1&#8208;seleno&#8208;&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;gluco&#8208; and mannopyranosides in total yield of 78%. Acetoxyphenylselenylation of differently protected galactals and 3,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;d&#8208;glucal under the action of Ph2S2  and PhI(OAc)2  has been shown to be a convenient method for the synthesis of 1&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;2&#8208;seleno&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy derivatives, valuable intermediates in chemistry of 2&#8208;deoxysugars. 2&#8208;Seleno&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy sugars were characterized in detail by NMR data including  77Se chemical shifts and  nJSe&#8208;H  coupling constant values.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8211;H Amination Enabled [2+1+1+1] Annulation Reaction in Water: Access to Benzoxazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and efficient strategy to prepare benzoxazoles through a [2+1+1+1] annulation of benzo&#8208;1,2&#8208;quinones, aldehydes, hydroxylamine hydrochloride and water is reported. The method is operationally simple and gram&#8208;scalable; it has a broad substrate scope and valuable functional group tolerance, and ensures high yields.







Abstract
A novel and efficient four&#8208;component reaction in water is reported, enabling the efficient synthesis of benzoxazoles from aldehydes, benzo&#8208;1,2&#8208;quinones, hydroxylamine hydrochloride, and water via a C&#8722;H amination strategy. Importantly, water is not only employed as the solvent but also used as the oxygen source of the benzoxazole skeletons, while inorganic hydroxylamine hydrochloride serves as the nitrogen source. Preliminary mechanistic studies prove that the aldoxime rather than the quinone oxime is the reaction intermediate.

         <title>Synthesis of Symmetrical and Unsymmetrical Thiosulfonates from Disulfides through Electrochemically Induced Disulfide Bond Metathesis and Site&#8208;Selective Oxidation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anodic generation of symmetrical and unsymmetrical thiosulfonates is presented. The principle of the oxidation of symmetrical disulfides was expanded to the conversion of in&#8197;situ generated unsymmetrical disulfides yielding the respective thiosulfonates. A strong dependency of the regioselectivity for the formation of the unsymmetrical thiosulfonates was encountered and allows their regioselective formation in the future.







Abstract
The anodic generation of symmetrical and unsymmetrical thiosulfonates is presented. First, the oxidation of disulfides yielding symmetrical thiosulfonates was realized. The direct synthesis is performed using a simple quasi&#8208;divided cell design, whereby using a supporting electrolyte is unnecessary. Its principle was then expanded to the conversion of unsymmetrical disulfides that were generated in&#8197;situ through metathesis of two symmetrical disulfides. This enables a direct access to unsymmetrical thiosulfonates without any pre&#8208;functionalization or elaborate synthesis of the starting materials for the first time. The reaction scope was investigated by converting differently functionalized aliphatic and aromatic disulfides in moderate to very good yields. Furthermore, a sensitivity assessment for an improved reproducibility and a robustness screen to determine the compatibility of the reaction against functional groups were performed.

         <title>Sulfoximine&#8208;Directed Arene ortho&#8208;Lithiation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The growing importance of sulfoximines in medicinal chemistry has led to a renewed interest in their synthesis and functionalization. This review describes the directed ortho&#8208;lithiation of S&#8208;aryl sulfoximines. Discussed are the synthesis and reactivity of five different types of o&#8208;lithiosulfoximines, including o&#8208;lithiosulfoximines with and without &#945;&#8208;hydrogen atoms, o,o&#8208;dilithiosulfoximines, o,N&#8208;dilithiosulfoximines and o,&#945;&#8208;dilithiosulfoximines.







Abstract
Sulfoximines are an interesting class of compounds, which exhibit Br&#248;nsted and Lewis basicity, nucleophilicity, C&#8722;H acidity, N&#8722;H acidity, hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor capability and chirality. Sulfoximines have received renewed interest in recent times, since incorporation of a sulfoximine group can provide drug candidates with favorable properties. The synthesis and N&#8722;H, &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H and o&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of sulfoximines are currently topics of considerable interest. This Minireview describes the sulfoximine&#8208;directed arene ortho&#8208;lithiation and the synthesis of ortho&#8208;substituted S&#8208;aryl sulfoximines. Comparison between the sulfoximine and sulfone group shows that both are equally potent directors in arene ortho&#8208;lithiation. Double ortho&#8208;lithiation of S&#8208;phenyl sulfoximines affords o,o'&#8208;dilithiosulfoximines, which undergo a stereoretentive rearrangement to o&#8208;sulfinylanilines. S&#8208;Phenyl sulfoximines, carrying a &#945;&#8208;hydrogen atom, are amendable to a selective ortho&#8208;lithiation to give o&#8208;lithiosulfoximines, which suffer transmetalation to the &#945;&#8208;lithiosulfoximines at ambient temperatures. Double lithiation of S&#8208;phenyl N&#8722;H sulfoximines gives access to o,N&#8208;dilithiosulfoximines, the reaction of which with biselectrophiles yields bicyclic sulfoximines.

         <title>Construction of Si&#8208;Stereogenic Silanes through C&#8722;H Activation Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation of chiral Si&#8208;stereogenic silanes, a class of functional molecules with increasing values in synthetic chemistry, medicinal chemistry, and material chemistry, via transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation approach is an elegant and attractive manner, in short steps from simple starting materials. This Minireview summarizes the advances in construction of Si&#8208;stereogenic silanes by using this approach as well as future perspectives.







Abstract
The asymmetric synthesis of Si&#8208;stereogenic silanes has attracted great attention due to the increasing values of Si&#8208;containing functional molecules in synthetic chemistry, medicinal chemistry, and material chemistry. Merging organosilicon chemistry with transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H approach has led to rich sets of new reactions holding great synthetic values. This Minireview aims to summarize the advances in the construction of Si&#8208;stereogenic silanes through the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation approach.

         <title>Micelle&#8208;Mediated Trimerization of Ynals to Orthogonally Substituted 4H&#8208;Pyrans in Water: Downstream Rearrangement to Bioactive 2,8&#8208;dioxabicyclo[3.3.1]nona&#8208;3,6&#8208;diene Frameworks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and environmentally benign protocol has been devised to induce trimerization of ynals to 4H&#8208;pyrans in water. This strategy has been successfully tested on a range of aliphatic, aromatic and hetero&#8208;aromatic substrates. Acid&#8208;mediated rearrangement of 4H&#8208;pyrans to interesting 2,8&#8208;dioxabicyclo[3.3.1]nona&#8208;3,6&#8208;dienes has been also demonstrated. The location of the reaction site in the micelle&#8216;s palisade region was established through proton NMR studies.







Abstract
An efficient trimerization of ynals to diversely substituted 4H&#8208;pyran constructs has been executed in water, under ambient conditions employing micellar catalysis. The method is in agreement with the ideas of green and sustainable chemistry. The locus of the micellar reaction site has been probed through proton NMR studies. A general acid&#8208;mediated downstream rearrangement of the derived 4H&#8208;pyrans to interesting 2,8&#8208;dioxabicyclo[3.3.1]nona&#8208;3,6&#8208;dienes has been observed.

         <title>Passerini and Ugi Reactions Involving Kinetically Unstable Isocyanides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The kinetically unstable vinyl, allenyl and propargyl isocyanides were reacted under the conditions of Passerini and Ugi reactions. They led to &#945;&#8208;acyloxy amides and &#945;&#8208;amino amides with an unsaturated substituent on the nitrogen atom in reasonable yields. Some of them were then functionalized thanks to the pending unsaturation, opening the field of complex products in subsequent reactions.







Abstract
Kinetically unstable isocyanides as vinyl, allenyl and propargyl isocyanides react in Passerini and Ugi reactions faster than they decompose and lead to functionalized &#945;&#8208;acyloxy amides and &#945;&#8208;amino amides, respectively, which can subsequently be used in reactions involving the unsaturated substituent.

         <dc:description>In the quest for 3,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactam building blocks, the serendipitous formation of 2,2&#8208;dichloro&#8208;  N  &#8208;(chloromethyl)acetamides was observed. This peculiar reactivity was investigated in detail, both experimentally and computationally by means of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. 2,2&#8208;Dichloro&#8208;N&#8208;(chloromethyl)acetamides were thus shown to be formed experimentally through reaction of 2,2&#8208;dichloroacetyl chloride with glyceraldehyde&#8208;derived imines, i.e. (2,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolan&#8208;4&#8208;yl)methanimines, bearing aromatic N&#8208;substituents, in the presence as well as in the absence of a base. Deployment of aliphatic imines, however, resulted in complex reaction mixtures, pointing to the importance of a stabilizing aromatic substituent at nitrogen. The DFT results indicate that the substituents can alter the governing equilibria on the one hand and intrinsic barrier heights for the different routes on the other hand, showing that these are controlling the reaction outcome. Furthermore, the 2,2&#8208;dichloro&#8208;  N  &#8208;(chloromethyl)acetamides proved to be rather unstable in solution and thus difficult to isolate. Nonetheless, their molecular structure was confirmed by means of NMR analysis of several purified analogs and X&#8208;ray study of a 4&#8208;methoxyphenyl derivative.</dc:description>

         <title>RNA Hydrolysis by Heterocyclic Amidines and Guanidines: Parameters Affecting Reactivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterocyclic amidines and guanidines have been tested as RNA cleaving catalysts, which led to the identification of potent candidates. Besides pKa values and steric effects, the energy difference between tautomeric forms seems to be one of the relevant parameters, accessible by computational methods on different levels of sophistication. The fast semi&#8208;empirical AM1&#8208;method was found sufficient to provide qualitative to semi&#8208;quantitative estimates of corresponding trends.







Abstract
2&#8208;Aminobenzimidazole 10, although a weak catalyst in the monomeric state, is a successful building block for effective artificial ribonucleases. In an effort to identify new building blocks with improved catalytic potential, RNA cleavage by a variety of heterocyclic amidines and guanidines has been studied. In addition to pKa values and steric effects, the energy difference between tautomeric forms seems to be another important parameter for catalysis. This information is available from quantum chemical calculations on higher levels, but semiempirical methods are sufficient to get a first estimate. According to this assumption, imidazoimidazol 18, characterized by isoenergetic tautomeric forms, is superior to 2&#8208;aminoimidazol 6, the best candidate among the simple compounds. By far the largest effects are seen with 2&#8208;aminoperimidine 24, which rapidly cleaves RNA even in the micromolar concentration range. The impressive reactivity, however, is related to a tendency of compound 24 to form polycationic aggregates which are the actual catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;2-Aminobenzimidazole &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt;, although a weak catalyst in the monomeric state, is a successful building block for effective artificial ribonucleases. In an effort to identify new building blocks with improved catalytic potential, RNA cleavage by a variety of heterocyclic amidines and guanidines has been studied. In addition to p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values and steric effects, the energy difference between tautomeric forms seems to be another important parameter for catalysis. This information is available from quantum chemical calculations on higher levels, but semiempirical methods are sufficient to get a first estimate. According to this assumption, imidazoimidazol &lt;b&gt;18&lt;/b&gt;, characterized by isoenergetic tautomeric forms, is superior to 2-aminoimidazol &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;, the best candidate among the simple compounds. By far the largest effects are seen with 2-aminoperimidine &lt;b&gt;24&lt;/b&gt;, which rapidly cleaves RNA even in the micromolar concentration range. The impressive reactivity, however, is related to a tendency of compound &lt;b&gt;24&lt;/b&gt; to form polycationic aggregates which are the actual catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scope, limitations and mechanistic analysis of the HyperBTM&#8208;catalyzed acylative kinetic resolution of tertiary heterocyclic alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The full scope and limitations of the catalytic acylative kinetic resolution of a range of tertiary heterocyclic alcohols (81 examples,  s  up to &gt; 200) is reported under operationally&#8208;simple conditions, using low loadings of a commercially&#8208;available Lewis basic isothiourea catalyst, HyperBTM (generally 1 mol%). The protocol is highly effective for the kinetic resolution of 3&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;hydroxyoxindole and a&#8208;substituted a&#8208;hydroxylactam derivatives bearing up to three potential recognition motifs at the stereogenic tertiary carbinol centre. The full power of this methodology has been showcased through the synthesis of highly enantioenriched biologically&#8208;active target compounds in both enantiomeric forms. To provide further insight into the reaction mechanism, a detailed kinetic analysis of this Lewis base&#8208;catalyzed acylation of tertiary alcohols is reported using the VTNA method.</dc:description>

         <title>Some Surprising Transformations of Colchicone and Other Colchicine&#8208;Derived Tropolones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Who would have predicted the reactions outcome? Derivatives of the prominent alkaloid colchicine were found to react in a very surprising fashion with common reagents to afford unexpected products. The unique reactivity of tropolone ethers and their subtle interplay with adjacent functional groups have to be taken into account to solve the mechanistic puzzles.







Abstract
The alkaloid colchicine represents a prominent lead structure for the development of tubulin&#8208;binding chemotherapeutics. In the course of explorative research into semi&#8208;synthetic colchicinoids we stumbled upon a number of unexpected and mechanistically surprising transformations which reflect the very particular reactivity of the tropolone ether unit and its interplay with adjacent functional groups. Examples are the selective C&#8208;8&#8208;methylation of colchicone upon reaction with the Wittig reagent triphenylphosphonium methylide, the AlMe3&#8208;mediated isomerization of colchicone to a tetracyclic lactone, and the cyanide&#8208;induced reaction of the colchicol&#8208;derived mesylate to a rearranged and ring B&#8208;defunctionalized cyano&#8208;allo&#8208;colchicinoid. Finally, the fragmenting rearrangement of a tetracyclic colchicinoid with BF3.OEt2 in the presence of vinyl&#8208;MgBr afforded a tropolonyl difluoroborate under concomitant transfer of an O&#8208;methyl group from ring C to ring A.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative 1,2&#8208;Addition of Carboxylic Acids to Glyoxylic Acid Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Palladium&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;addition reaction of carboxylic acids to glyoxylic acid esters is reported. This method provides access to mandelic acid derivatives from simple, readily available starting materials in good yields. Carboxylic acids are utilized as more sustainable alternative to common organometallic nucleophiles.







Abstract
The formation of C&#8722;C&#8208;bonds constitutes one of the most fundamental synthetic operations in organic chemistry. The nucleophilic addition of preformed organometallic reagents to an electrophilic carbonyl functionality represents a classical method for the selective construction of a C&#8722;C&#8208;bond. However, the synthesis and utilization of an organometallic reagent is associated with an unfavorable environmental profile. Herein, we disclose a Palladium&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative 1,2&#8208;addition of carboxylic acids to glyoxylic acid esters. This novel method provides access to the mandelic acid scaffold in good yields. Easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle and readily available benzoic acids are utilized as more sustainable alternative to preformed organometallic nucleophiles.

         <title>Stabilizing Indigo Z&#8208;Isomer through Intramolecular Associations of Redox&#8208;Active Appendages</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active indenofluorene&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene units were added as appendages to the indigo photoswitch. Upon oxidation of these two units to radical cations, a significantly enhanced stability of the indigo Z&#8208;isomer was observed. Thus, the half&#8208;life for the Z&#8208;to&#8208;E isomerization changed from less than a second to several hours upon formation of the dication, ascribed to intramolecular association between the two radical cation units.







Abstract
Photoswitchable small molecules, such as N,N&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted indigos, have received great interest within fields such as pharmacology, energy storage, and functional materials, as they represent key building blocks for reversible and non&#8208;invasive control of chemical processes. However, to ensure applicability of photochromic systems it is of paramount importance to manipulate the photostationary state. In this work, we achieved this by tethering two redox&#8208;active indenofluorene&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene units to an N,N&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted indigo photoswitch. Upon two&#8208;electron oxidation, we observe significantly enhanced stability of the Z&#8208;isomer, compared to the neutral compound, illustrated by a substantial increase in the half&#8208;life from 0.48&#8197;seconds to 22&#8197;hours. This remarkable stabilization is ascribed to formation of strong, intramolecular &#960;&#8208;dimers between the oxidized subunits.

         <title>N&#8208;Aroylsulfonamide&#8208;Photofragmentation (ASAP)&#8208;A Versatile Route to Biaryls</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile and powerful method for the preparation of biaryls is described, which is based on the photochemical fragmentation of N&#8208;aroylsulfonamides. In addition to biaryls, isocyanates and sulfur dioxide are formed.







Abstract
The photochemical fragmentation of N&#8208;aroylsulfonamides 9 (ASAP) is a powerful method for the preparation of various biaryls. Compounds 9 are easily accessible in two steps from amines by treatment with arenesulfonyl chlorides and aroyl chlorides. Many of these compounds were prepared for the first time. The irradiation takes place in a previously developed continuous&#8208;flow reactor using inexpensive UVB or UVC fluorescent lamps. Isocyanates and sulphur dioxide are formed as the only by&#8208;products. The ASAP tolerates a variety of functional groups and is even suited for the preparation of phenylnaphthalenes and terphenyls. The ASAP mechanism was elucidated by interaction of photophysical and quantum chemical (DFT) methods and revealed a spirocyclic biradical as key intermediate.

         <title>Thioureidocalix[6]arenes Pseudorotaxanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel calix[6]arene derivatives with phenylthioureido hydrogen&#8208;bond donor (HBD) groups appended at the upper rim were investigated. The number of HBD units affects the conformation of the macrocyclic hosts and their binding abilities towards bipyridinium&#8208;based guests, as a function of their counterions.







Abstract
Heteroditopic calix[6]arenes are extensively exploited as synthetic receptors and as molecular components of supramolecular threaded and interlocked structures. We describe the synthesis of two novel calix[6]arene macrocycles, the upper rim of which is functionalized with either two or three phenylthioureido groups. These moieties are excellent hydrogen&#8208;bond donors and largely affect the conformation of the macrocycle, both in solution and in the solid state. Alternate conformers are observed in solution, and they give rise to supramolecular chains in the solid state. Moreover, and because of this conformational freedom, also the recognition properties toward the formation of pseudorotaxanes with bipyridinium&#8208;based axles are strongly affected. The number of phenylthioureido units of the macrocyclic host and the nature of the counterions of the bipyridinium guest determine the stability of the complexes. NMR, UV&#8208;Vis and electrochemical measurements revealed that very stable 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complexes are formed between the triphenylthioureido calix[6]arene and a bipyridinium guest with tosylate counterions, whereas no complex is observed between the diphenylthioureido macrocycle and a hexafluorophosphate bipyridinium salt.

         <title>Organic Transformation of Benzothiophenes by C&#8722;S Bond Cleavage Beyond Reductive Desulfurization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Skeleton reconstruction of benzothiophenes can be realized by directly endocyclic C&#8722;S bond cleavage. Description in this review also include the achievement with the oxidative derivatives of benzothiophene, such as sulfoxides, sulfones and S&#8208;ylides.







Abstract
As the analogues of indole bicyclic system, benzothiophenes are often overlooked in organic transformation, and synthetic methods developed mostly rely on the acidic protons at C2 or C3 position, known as C&#8722;H functionalization. Complementary to the structural modification of benzothiophenes, C&#8722;S bond cleavage can realize the skeleton reconstruction. Reduction of benzothiophenes always involves the C&#8722;S bond cleavage, especially in the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of petroleum products. Beyond reductive desulfurization, although C&#8722;S bond cleavage of benzothiophenes has been achieved by diverse methodologies, there is no systematic review on such topic. Herein, transformation of benzothiophenes via C&#8722;S bond cleavage in organic synthesis will be presented along with briefly delineated mechanism.

         <title>Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;(R)&#8208;Sitagliptin by RhI&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydroamination</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise, asymmetric synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;(R)&#8208;Sitagliptin is presented utilizing a RhI/Josiphos&#8208;based hydroamination strategy as a key step beside allene preparation and amide coupling. The unusual &#946;&#8208;amino function was accomplished by an anti&#8208;Markovnikov selective Wacker oxidation and subsequent Pinnick oxidation. The synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;(R)&#8208;Sitagliptin proceeded over three isolated intermediates providing 3.5&#8197;mmol in an overall yield of 47&#8201;%.







Abstract
We report of a concise synthesis of (R)&#8208;sitagliptin monophosphate &#8211; a drug predominantly applied in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Utilizing our recently developed RhI&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of allenes for the stereoselective construction of the inherent chiral amino function, a new approach to (R)&#8208;sitagliptin monophosphate on a 3.5&#8197;mmol scale was established.

         <title>Borane Catalyzed Redox Isomerization of 2&#8208;Amino Chalcones: Hydride Abstraction or Hydride Migration?</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The borane catalyzed redox isomerization of 2&#8208;amino chalocones was developed. Mechanistic investigations by kinetic, isotopic labelling, and competition experiments as well as computational studies corroborate the concerted [1,5] hydride shift as operative mechanism. The redox isomerization products are obtained in high yield and up to &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
The borane catalyzed redox isomerization of 2&#8208;amino chalcones was developed. The tetrahydroquinolines are obtained in high yield as a mixture of cis/trans diastereomers in a ratio of 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 to &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5. The reaction mechanism is investigated by mechanistic, kinetic, and computational methods, concluding that the reaction proceeds through concerted [1,5] hydride shift in contrast to borane&#8208;mediated C(sp3)&#8722;H hydride abstraction.

         <title>Bidirectional Synthesis, Photophysical and Electrochemical Characterization of Polycyclic Quinones Using Benzocyclobutenes and Benzodicyclobutenes as Precursors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of some new extended polycyclic quinones was achieved through a one&#8208;pot procedure comprising the cycloaddition of benzocyclobutene and benzodicyclobutene derivatives with benzoquinone or naphthoquinone. Notably, a highly symmetrical nonacene&#8208;hexaone could be prepared, albeit in low yields (5&#8211;7&#8201;%).







Abstract
Quinones have widespread applications in view of their interesting chemical and photophysical features. On the other hand, benzocyclobutenes (BCBs) are generally masked reactive dienes suitable for the [4+2] cycloaddition reactions. Here, benzocyclobutenes and benzodicyclobutenes (BDCBs) were prepared and further reacted with benzoquinone and naphthoquinone in order to obtain some new polycyclic quinones with highly extended &#960; systems, namely, 6&#8208;bromo&#8208;5,8&#8208;dimethoxyanthracene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione, 2,9&#8208;dibromo&#8208;1,4,8,11&#8208;tetramethoxypentacene&#8208;6,13&#8208;dione, 9&#8208;bromo&#8208;7,10&#8208;dimethoxytetracene&#8208;5,12&#8208;dione, 3,10&#8208;dimethoxycyclobuta[b]anthracene&#8208;1,5,8(2H)&#8208;trione, 6,10,17,21&#8208;tetramethoxynonacene&#8208;1,4,8,12,15,19&#8208;hexaone, and 3,12&#8208;dimethoxycyclobuta[b]tetracene&#8208;1,5,10(2H)&#8208;trione. In addition to their spectroscopic characterization the new compounds are investigated by UV and fluorescence spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and DFT calculations.

&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of some new extended polycyclic quinones was achieved through a one-pot procedure comprising the cycloaddition of benzocyclobutene and benzodicyclobutene derivatives with benzoquinone or naphthoquinone. Notably, a highly symmetrical nonacene-hexaone could be prepared, albeit in low yields (5&#8211;7&#8201;%).

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Synthesis of a Hexapeptide by Fragment Coupling in a Ball Mill</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using solvent&#8208;less techniques such as ball milling, a hexapeptide was synthesized in gram scale without using any toxic solvents. To date, this hexapeptide is the largest precisely controlled amino acid sequence ever synthesized in a ball mill. This study paves the way to future developments for the synthesis of longer peptides (and proteins) by using ball milling.







Abstract
Synthesis of long peptides is generally considered as a challenge to peptide chemists, in addition to producing significant amounts of toxic waste, such as DMF. Here we show that using solvent&#8208;less methods, such as ball milling, enabled the production of the hexapeptide Boc&#8208;(Ala&#8208;Phe&#8208;Gly)2&#8208;OBn at the gram scale with high overall yield (77&#8201;%, 5 linear steps). This is the longest peptide chain synthesized in a ball mill to date, in which the amino acid sequence is precisely controlled. This study complements the current fundamental knowledge required to synthesize longer and more difficult peptide chains (or small proteins) by using peptide fragment couplings in a ball mill.

         <title>A Continuous&#8208;Flow Route to Enantioenriched 3&#8208;Substituted&#8208;3&#8208;Hydroxyoxindoles: Organocatalytic Aldol Reactions of Isatin with Acetone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first continuous flow synthesis of 3&#8208;substituted&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxyoxindoles, providing a safer and seamless way for accelerating the isatin&#8208;acetone reaction at higher temperatures without compromising enantioselectivity is reported. Kamlet&#8208;Taft basicity (&#946;) and proticity (&#945;) of solvents were found to be crucial in describing the solubility of isatin and performance of L&#8208;leucinol organocatalyst and informed the choice of solvent for transfer to flow.







Abstract
An efficient L&#8208;leucinol catalysed asymmetric synthesis of 3&#8208;substitued&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxyoxindoles was for the first time completed under continuous flow, providing a safer route for accelerating the reaction at higher temperatures without adversely affecting enantioselectivity. Initial batch solvent screening of the isatin&#8208;acetone aldol reaction revealed neat acetone as the media best suited in flow as it dissolved isatin and afforded (S)&#8208;enantiomer of the adduct in 84&#8201;% ee. Solvents with Kamlet&#8208;Taft basicity (&#946;)&gt;0.6 and proticity (&#945;)&#8776;0 had a higher solubility of isatin but poor reaction performance while solvents with &#946;&lt;0.2 and &#945;&lt;0.6 performed excellently in the reaction albeit with poor isatin solubility. The addition of 10 equivalents of water improved the neat reaction to afford 94&#8201;% yield in 93&#8201;% ee at 20&#8201;&#176;C after 48&#8197;h. When transferred to continuous flow, complete conversion was observed in 12&#8197;h residence time at 40&#8201;&#176;C without loss in enantioselectivity. Further substrate studies in flow were undertaken with a 4&#8208;fold dilution and a 60&#8201;&#176;C reaction temperature required for some derivatives. Excellent yields and enantioselectivities were obtained in most cases.

         <title>Compounds Combining a Macrocyclic Building Block and Flexible Side&#8208;Arms as Carbohydrate Receptors: Syntheses and Structure&#8208;Binding Activity Relationship Studies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;binding activity relationship studies with compounds consisting of a macrocyclic building block and flexible side&#8208;arms revealed the essential role of the side&#8208;arms in achieving strong complexation of all&#8208;equatorial substituted sugars, such as &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranoside.







Abstract
A series of new representatives of compounds combining a macrocyclic building block and flexible side&#8208;arms were prepared and their ability to act as carbohydrate receptors evaluated. The target compounds were obtained by multi&#8208;step syntheses, which included the preparation of numerous precursors as well as the isolation of a large number of by&#8208;products. The structure&#8208;binding activity relationship studies comprise, in particular, the variation of the side&#8208;arms in order to demonstrate the importance of the presence of a hydrogen bond donor in these units for the effective complexation of carbohydrates. Based on the findings of our previous studies, the variation of the bridge units is limited to benzene&#8208; and pyrrole&#8208;based moieties, whereby the use of the last&#8208;mentioned bridge type was expected to produce more effective systems. This assumption was confirmed by 1H NMR titrations and isothermal titration calorimetry.

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Diaminoxylosides via Iodosulfonamidation of Xylal Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The power of iodosulfonamidation of glycals was used for the synthesis of 2,4&#8208;diaminoxylosides, which are of interest as conformational switches. The synthetic pathway proceeds from an l&#8208;arabino configuration over a glycal with two stereocenters in a threo relation to the d&#8208;xylo configuration of the product with compelling selectivity.







Abstract
d&#8208;Xylose is a special monosaccharide found in various organisms, which is characterized by conformational dynamics between different pyranose ring forms depending on the substitution pattern. With a perspective to study the conformational equilibria of xylosides and eventually use them as conformational switches, we sought an entry into a flexible synthesis of 2,4&#8208;diamino&#8208;xylosides. In particular, we synthesized 4&#8208;bromophenyl 2,4&#8208;diamino&#8208;3&#8208;O&#8208;(4&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;xyloside from l&#8208;arabinose utilizing a concomitant epimerization and differentiation at position 4 and iodosulfonamidation of a difunctional xylal at a later stage of the synthetic pathway. This strategy provides xylose derivatives with high stereochemical precision and a high degree of functionalization. The obtained xylose derivatives are of interest as conformational hinge molecules and as orthogonally protected triamino scaffold molecules.

         <title>Emerging building blocks for medicinal chemistry: recent synthetic advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current medicinal chemistry relies heavily on the quality of building blocks, i.e. reagents used to introduce chemical diversity into the target molecules. The last decade witnessed an emergence of many novel (or well&#8208;overlooked old) chemotypes for drug discovery, which is related to adapting new synthetic methodologies, designing new  sp3&#8208;enriched bioisosteres, paying attention to previously underrated (or even unwanted) structural motifs, or combination thereof. In this review with 532 references, a survey of selected chemotypes that emerged recently in medicinal chemistry is provided, with a focus on the synthesis of the corresponding building blocks. Thus, saturated (hetero)aliphatic boronates, sulfonyl fluorides, sulfinates, non&#8208;classical  sp3&#8208;enriched benzene isosteres, bicyclic morpholine/piperidine/piperazine analogs, as well as  gem&#8208;difluorinated cycloalkanes (as an example of emerging fluorinated motifs) are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkylation of Electron&#8208;Deficient Olefins through Conjugate Addition of Organozinc Reagents: An Update</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the efficient reactions related to alkylation of electron&#8208;deficient olefins through the conjugate addition of organozinc reagents, including their advantages, limitations, and possibilities for improvement. Both asymmetric and non&#8208;asymmetric conjugate additions are highlighted. Cyclic and acyclic enones, enals, &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes have been used as electron&#8208;deficient olefins.







Abstract
This review focuses on the applications of organozinc reagents in conjugate addition reactions. Organozinc compounds are a class of organometallic reagent used in various reactions such as addition, substitution, and coupling reactions. The conjugate addition or 1, 4&#8208;addition is one of the most useful bond forming strategies used in organic synthesis since broad range of nucleophiles can be employed in the reaction. Addition of organozinc to electron&#8208;deficient olefins attracts synthetic chemists as it preferably undergoes conjugate addition over 1,2&#8208;addition unlike other organometallic reagents, such as Grignard reagent or organolithium. Many natural products were also synthesized by applying the conjugate addition reaction of organozinc. Moreover, organozinc reagents have superior functional group compatibility and can be easily prepared relative to other organometallic compounds. Consequently, conjugate additions of organozinc reagents were highly studied and having a review on it is very important at present. Though a few reviews are available, they either do not focus directly on the organozinc reagents or not on the conjugate addition. We hope that this review article will be of great use to organic researchers.

         <title>A 2000 to 2020 Practitioner&#8217;s Guide to Chiral Amine Based Enantioselective Aldol Reactions:Common Ketone Substrates,Best Methods,in Water Reaction Environments,and Defining Nuances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We begin with an extensive introduction for the non&#8208;expert regarding enantioselective, amine catalyzed, aldol reactions (Sections 1&#8208;3). There, a broad prospective is provided regarding: methodology limitations, mechanism, in water versus on water definitions and their theoretical basis, small&#8208; and large&#8208;scale physical&#8208;mechanical aspects, solid versus liquid starting material considerations, reproducibility, ball milling, diketone substrates, etc. The thematic emphasis then turns to practical outcomes for the reaction of nineteen aliphatic, cyclic, and aromatic ketones with 4&#8208;nitrobenzaldehyde and benzaldehyde prior to 2021. The ketone substrates are listed in Section 4 of the TOC and their structures are shown in Figure 1. Each ketone is linked to a summary defined by a: (i) schematic, (ii) text summary, (iii) catalyst Figures, and (iv) tabular reaction/product data. Individual ketone summaries, at times, represent the distillation of over six hundred research articles, and the data refinement and its tabular reconstitution is not reproducible using a chemical database search with filters. In the review&#8217;s broadest use, the Figure 1 ketone structures serve as templates to extrapolate to a hypothetical substrate holding more functionality, but of related steric and electronic similarity. This pseudo matching permits a rapid answer to, &#8220;Does this methodology suit the ketone substrate at hand or not?&#8221; In a positive outcome, the best reaction conditions (stoichiometry, catalyst structure and loading, solvent, time, etc.) to affect aldol product formation (yield, dr, and ee) are delineated. A second envisioned use allows the directed construction of diketone substrates (after viewing the tabularized data of Section 4), which then undergo regioselective mono&#8208;aldol product formation. This tactic, reacting one carbonyl moiety while the other remains unreacted, avoids ketone protection&#8208;deprotection, and is shown for the advantageous synthesis of an Alzheimer drug candidate.</dc:description>

Herein, we report a novel transition metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free visible light&#8208;photoinduced protocol for direct Csp2&#8211;H difluoromethylation of heterocycle of green approach. The reaction afforded difluoromethyl heterocycles without colored organic dyes and metal&#8208;catalysts. It was in good yields with a broad substrate tolerance. Moreover, the representative products exhibited the green potential drugs activity, and 2h showed good antifungal activities against Rhizoctorzia solani (62.7%).</dc:description>

         <title>Lewis&#8208;Acid&#8208;Catalyzed (3+2)&#8208;Cycloadditions of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes with Thioketenes</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of dialkyl 2&#8208;methylidene tetrahydrothiophene&#8208;3,3&#8208;dicarboxylates was prepared from (tert&#8208;butyl)iso&#8208;propyl thioketene via Lewis acid catalyzed (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition with D&#8208;A cyclopropanes. In all studied cases the (Z)&#8208;diastereoisomer was found as the main product.







Abstract
The reactivity of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) cyclopropanes towards thioketenes was investigated. In a (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition using Sc(OTf)3 as a Lewis acidic catalyst, the corresponding exocyclic thioenol ethers (2&#8208;methylidene tetrahydrothiophenes) were formed in moderate to good yields. Unsymmetrical thioketenes provided E/Z mixtures at the double bond, with the Z isomer being preferred.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Polymer Bioconjugates Prepared by Post&#8208;Polymerization Modification of Alternating Copolymers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward strategy is proposed for the synthesis of protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugates using one of the oldest polymers, the poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride). Different poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) copolymers were successfully prepared by RAFT polymerization in dioxane using the 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;propyl dodecyl trithiocarbonate as chain transfer agent (CTA) and AIBN as initiator. Original biomacromolecules were successfully prepared by post&#8208;polymerization modification.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugates have shown great promise in biomedical and life science applications including drug delivery and diagnosis. The current bioconjugation strategies suffer from lack of efficiency and versatility. In this article, poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) copolymers were first prepared by RAFT polymerization and characterized by different analytical techniques. Then, the poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) precursors were functionalized with primary amine such as azidopropylamine and amino poly(ethylene glycol). The reaction of amino compounds with maleic anhydride was found to be a highly efficient, a versatile, and a facile chemical ligation reaction for the synthesis of macromolecules with quantitative yield under mild conditions. The main benefit is the incorporation of a wide range of functionality by easily changing the primary amine compound. For the amphiphilic graft copolymers based on poly(ethylene glycol), aggregation behavior in water was investigated. In a second part, azido&#8208;functionalized polystyrene copolymers were used to prepare a new protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugate by copper&#8208;free click chemistry reaction.

Different poly(styrene-&lt;i&gt;alt&lt;/i&gt;-maleic anhydride) copolymers were successfully prepared by RAFT polymerization in dioxane using the 2-cyano-2-propyl dodecyl trithiocarbonate as chain transfer agent (CTA) and AIBN as initiator. Original biomacromolecules were successfully prepared by post-polymerization modification.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein-polymer bioconjugates have shown great promise in biomedical and life science applications including drug delivery and diagnosis. The current bioconjugation strategies suffer from lack of efficiency and versatility. In this article, poly(styrene-&lt;i&gt;alt&lt;/i&gt;-maleic anhydride) copolymers were first prepared by RAFT polymerization and characterized by different analytical techniques. Then, the poly(styrene-&lt;i&gt;alt&lt;/i&gt;-maleic anhydride) precursors were functionalized with primary amine such as azidopropylamine and amino poly(ethylene glycol). The reaction of amino compounds with maleic anhydride was found to be a highly efficient, a versatile, and a facile chemical ligation reaction for the synthesis of macromolecules with quantitative yield under mild conditions. The main benefit is the incorporation of a wide range of functionality by easily changing the primary amine compound. For the amphiphilic graft copolymers based on poly(ethylene glycol), aggregation behavior in water was investigated. In a second part, azido-functionalized polystyrene copolymers were used to prepare a new protein-polymer bioconjugate by copper-free click chemistry reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Functionalization of C6/C7 Substituted Pyrido[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted pyrido[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidines are accessible by a reaction sequence consisting of HWE&#8208;reaction, a Z/E&#8208;photoisomerization, and ring closure of the pyridine ring. Bis&#8208;pyridopyrimidines can be obtained from 7&#8208;amino&#8208;pyrido[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidines.







Abstract
An efficient synthesis of functionalized pyrido[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidines is reported. Starting from 4&#8208;aminopyrimidine&#8208;3&#8208;carbaldehydes, a Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons olefination followed by a photoisomerization/cyclization installed the fused pyridine ring. Using substituted HWE&#8208;reagents various substituents could be introduced in the 7&#8208;position of the pyrido[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidines. Functionalization of the pyridone substructure allowed late variation in the 6&#8208;position. In order to obtain amine&#8208;linked bis&#8208;pyridopyrimidines, 7&#8208;bromo&#8208;pyridopyrimidines were converted with their 7&#8208;amino&#8208;counterpart by Hartwig&#8211;Buchwald amination.

         <title>Supported Synthesis of Adenosine Nucleotides and Derivatives on a Benzene&#8208;Centered Tripodal Soluble Support</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy based on anchoring C(6) azidopurine nucleoside derivative to a tripodal soluble support allows to access the corresponding adenosine nucleotides. We extended the scope of the method to methylene bisphosphonate analogues and N6&#8208;benzylamine derivative.







Abstract
The first soluble&#8208;phase synthesis of adenosine nucleotides including &#945;,&#946; and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;methylene bisphosphonate analogues on a multi&#8208;pod support is reported. Anchoring of a 2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;protected purine nucleoside to the tripodal support via the nucleobase was successfully achieved using a microwave assisted Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition. Then, phosphorylation was performed, followed by cleavage with aqueous ammonia to provide adenine derivatives, and finally deprotection. When using benzylamine instead of ammonia, a derivative with N6&#8208;benzylamine adenine as nucleobase was obtained. This methodology allows to access adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;mono, di and triphosphates, as well as various analogues of pharmacological interest in modest to good yields.

         <title>Heteroaliphatic Dimethylphosphine Oxide Building Blocks: Synthesis and Physico&#8208;Chemical Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multigram synthesis of saturated heterocyclic dimethylphosphine oxides (derivatives of azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, and morpholine) &#8211; advanced building blocks for medicinal chemistry &#8211; as well as their physico&#8208;chemical properties (pKa, logP, and Sw) are disclosed.







Abstract
Scalable synthesis of saturated heterocyclic dimethyl phosphine oxides (derivatives of azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, and morpholine) is disclosed. The key steps of the synthesis relied on the reactions of HP(O)Me2, i.&#8201;e. the phospha&#8208;Mannich (the Kabachnik&#8208;Fields&#8208;type) condensation with cyclic imines or monoprotected diamines, palladium&#8208;catalyzed reactions of alkenyl halides or trifltates (generated from cyclic ketones), as well as base&#8208;mediated nucleophilic substitution, Michael addition, or oxirane ring opening. It was shown that introducing the P(O)Me2 group into the saturated heterocyclic core had very strong impact on the compound's basicity: the corresponding &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;isomeric derivatives were by ca. 4, 2, and 1.6&#8197;pKa units less basic, respectively, as compared to the parent saturated heterocycle. Meanwhile, the P(O)Me2&#8208;substituted compound was more basic than its SO2i&#8208;Pr and SO2NMe2&#8208;containing isosteres (by ca. 1.2 and 0.4&#8197;pKa units, respectively). It was also demonstrated that the P(O)Me2 group typically increased the compound's hydrophilicity and aqueous solubility. In particular, the LogP values for the corresponding derivatives were by ca. 1.4&#8211;1.7 and 0.6&#8197;units lower than for the non&#8208;substituted counterpart and sulfonamide/sulfone isosteres, respectively. Finally, a potential of the synthesized building blocks to generate lead&#8208;like three&#8208;dimensional compound libraries was confirmed using the Nelson's LLAMA tool.

A robust gram&#8208;scale synthesis, physico&#8208;chemical characterization, and lead&#8208;likeness assessment of novel 4&#8208;di/trifluoromethyl&#8208;2&#8208;heterabicyclo[2.1.1]hexane building blocks as fluorinated 2,4&#8208;methanoproline analogues and phenyl isosteres are disclosed.







Abstract
A gram&#8208;scale synthesis, physico&#8208;chemical characterization, and lead&#8208;likeness assessment of 4&#8208;di/trifluoromethyl&#8208;2&#8208;heterabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes as fluorinated bicyclic proline analogues and phenyl isosteres are disclosed. The key step of the synthesis included iodocyclization of fluorinated 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;/3&#8208;aminomethyl methylenecyclobutanes; with the amino derivatives, the reaction was accompanied with carboxylation and further cyclization. Apart from the corresponding 4&#8208;di/trifluoromethyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;methanoprolines, a series of fluorinated oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexane&#8208;derived building blocks relevant to medicinal chemistry (i.&#8201;e. primary iodides, carboxylic acids, alcohols, azides, primary amines, sulfonyl chlorides, and alkynes) were prepared. For representative derivatives of the resulting fluorinated 2&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes, pKa and logP values were measured to clarify their potential as the possible phenyl isosteres. Apart from the somewhat increased acidity, fine&#8208;tuned lipophilicity intermediate between that of non&#8208;fluorinated or aromatic counterparts was observed. Finally, the potential of the title building blocks was demonstrated by generation of virtual compound libraries using the LLAMA software. The resulting libraries fitted perfectly the lead&#8208;like chemical space, had higher three&#8208;dimensionality, and showed lower mean lead&#8208;likeness penalty as compared to those obtained from either non&#8208;fluorinated or aromatic derivatives.

         <title>Functionalized 5&#8208;Amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles, their Hetero&#8208; and Macrocyclic Derivatives: Preparation and Synthetic Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach for the synthesis of new 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles with carboxylate group at the C&#8208;2 position, connected to the heterocycle directly or through an aliphatic linker, was developed. This process features readily available starting materials, simple operations, and good to high yields. Wide synthetic applicability of the obtained compounds was also successfully demonstrated by further modifications.







Abstract
An approach to a series of new 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles is described. Synthesis of the title compounds relied on a two&#8208;step sequence including heterocyclization of 2&#8208;amido&#8208;3,3&#8208;dichloroacrylonitriles with aliphatic secondary amines (dimethylamine, morpholine), primary aliphatic amines with active functional groups (2&#8208;aminoethanol and glycine ethyl ester), and aniline. An efficient and straightforward protocol introduces a carboxylate group at the C&#8208;2 position of 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles, connected to the heterocycle directly or through an aliphatic linker. This carboxylic group is an attractive motif that can be found in a variety of drug&#8208;relevant compounds and also used for further modifications. Furthermore, efficient transformations of selected trisubstituted compounds were used to demonstrate their rich synthetic potential &#8211; e.&#8201;g., as precursors to 2&#8208;(4&#8208;cyano&#8208;5&#8208;(dimethylamino)oxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetamides, oxazole&#8208;containing macrocyclic structures, 2&#8208;(oxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetamides, amino pyrazoles, 3&#8208;(4&#8208;cyano&#8208;5&#8208;aminoxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)coumarins, and oxazole amino acids.

         <title>Monoprotected Diamines Derived from 1,5&#8208;Disubstituted (Aza)spiro[2.3]hexane Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted (aza)spiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. Structural characterization of the obtained spirocyclic compounds provided a rationale for their applications in design of saturated ring isosteres and peptidomimetics.







Abstract
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted spiro[2.3]hexane and 5&#8208;azaspiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. In both cases, the method relied on the cyclopropanation of the corresponding cyclobutane or azetidine derivatives. In the case of monoprotected 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexanes, the title products were obtained as single diastereomers. X&#8208;Ray diffraction studies supported by exit vector plot (EVP) analysis showed that the obtained building blocks are promising piperidine/cycloalkane isosteres with potential utility to drug discovery. Also, conformations observed in the crystalline state for the two different diastereomers of 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexane derivatives prompt their application in design of &#946;&#8208;turn and sheet&#8208;like peptidomimetics, respectively.

         <title>Last of the gem&#8208;Difluorocycloalkanes 2: Synthesis of Fluorinated Cycloheptane Building Blocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isomeric gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane derivatives were obtained in two to six synthetic steps from readily available starting materials. The developed synthetic approaches were shown to be efficient for a multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of target compounds and involved six&#8208;membered ring homologation and/or deoxofluorination reactions as the key steps.







Abstract
The gem&#8208;difluorocycloalkane family was extended to all possible regioisomers of the gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane, monofunctionalized by carboxilic&#8208;, amino&#8208; or keto&#8208; group, that were synthesized on a multigram scale. The preparation of the corresponding building blocks was achieved from readily accessible starting materials either via six&#8208;membered ring homologation or deoxofluorination of the appropriate seven&#8208;membered cyclic ketones.

         <title>Reaction of N,N&#8208;Disubstituted Polyfluoroalkanethioamides with Diazomethane: Entry to New Thiirane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4&#8208;dioxane derivatives are discussed.






New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between N,N&#8208;disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4-dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4-dioxane derivatives are discussed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between &lt;i&gt;N,N&lt;/i&gt;-disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1-polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4-dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4-dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X-ray diffraction analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  Multigram synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates relying on efficient 4&#8211;5&#8208;step reaction sequences is described. The title compounds was obtained in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield).
  
  
  
  
 
 
  An approach to the synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates on a multigram scale was developed. Two synthetic strategies were evaluated: the first based on the lithiation&#8211;borylation of the corresponding 2&#8208;bromoallyl derivatives, and the other relying on regioselective hydroboration of the appropriate hetera&#8208;substituted enynes. The second method appeared to be more efficient in terms of scalability and substrate scope. Further steps included ring closing&#8208;metathesis, mild palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation with diazomethane, and reaction with KHF2 and furnished the title compounds in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield, 4&#8211;5 steps).

  A multigram synthesis of spirocyclic &#947;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;sultams is reported, which are advanced building blocks for organic synthesis and drug discovery. The synthesis proceeds through a one&#8208;pot reductive cyclization of cyclic cyano sulfonyl fluorides.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  One&#8208;pot intramolecular cyclization of novel sp3&#8208;enriched cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluorides into spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;sultams is disclosed. The method relies on nitrile group reduction followed by sulfonylation of amino group thus formed upon mild conditions (NaBH4, NiCl2&#183;6H2O in MeOH). Cyclization proceeds smoothly with considerable efficiency (48&#8211;84&#8201;%, 10 examples) on up to 30 g scale. The cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluoride intermediates can be obtained via S&#8208;nucleophilic substitution in &#946;&#8208;functionalized alkanenitriles or double alkylation of &#945;&#8208;alkylthioacetonitrile, followed by oxidative chlorination with Cl2 and further reaction with KHF2. The title mono&#8208; and bifunctional sultams are advanced sp3&#8208;enriched building blocks for drug discovery and organic synthesis providing novel substitution patterns and frameworks mimicking saturated nitrogen heterocycles such as pyrrolidine/pyrrolidone.
