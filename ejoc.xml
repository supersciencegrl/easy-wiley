         <title>Remote Selective Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling Reactions of Aryl C&#8211;H Bonds with Carboxylic Acids at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed remote selective cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of broadly useful synthetic building blocks biphenyl Weinreb amides with carboxylic acids is developed. This acetoxylation protocol is performed under room temperature using N&#8208;&#64258;uorobenzene&#8208;sulfonimide (NFSI) as the oxidant, exhibiting a wide range of functional group tolerance and affording &#948;&#8208;position&#8208; selective products up to 85% yield. Notably, a diverse set of carboxylic acid&#8208;containing drugs is also found to be compatible under the current reaction conditions. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that this reaction presumably proceeds through a seven&#8208;membered palladacycle intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Experimentation (HTE) Applied to the Synthesis of API Impurities: A Case Study in Oxidative Decarboxylation of Aryl Acetic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) has dramatically impacted experimental reaction development by enabling the rapid exploration of a diverse set of reaction conditions. During the past few decades, HTE has evolved as a tool to expedite reaction discovery and optimization. This work details the application of HTE to synthesize impurities of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) with ketone/aldehyde functionality, specially focusing on ibuprofen impurity E. Initial experiments using K2S2O8 as oxidant yielded moderate results. Subsequent HTE screens identified cerium ammonium nitrate (CAN) and RuCl3&#8208;NaIO4 as new effective decarboxylative oxidants, with RuCl3&#8208;NaIO4 in the presence of tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) achieving the highest yield of 65%. This optimized method was successfully applied to synthesize ibuprofen impurity E on a gram scale. Additionally, the applicability of these methods to obtain other API related substances, such as naproxen impurity L and ketoprofen impurity A, was demonstrated. This research highlights the potential of HTE to streamline the synthesis of API impurities, making them widely accessible for pharmaceutical development purposes.</dc:description>

         <title>Varying the Electronics on Isothiourea Catalysts: Basicity, Rate, and Selectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral and achiral substituted isothiourea catalysts were synthesized and employed in model silylation reactions to understand how changing the electronics on the catalyst core affected intermolecular interactions between catalyst intermediates and substrates, ultimately affecting selectivity and rate. Five different chiral catalysts were utilized in a silylation&#8208;based kinetic resolution of 2&#8208;(para substituted)phenylcyclohexanols and the rate of silylation of these same alcohols was investigated with three different achiral catalysts. Linear free energy relationships were examined, highlighting that rate and selectivity were highly dependent on the electronics of the catalyst and the substrate, and that both affected the intermolecular interactions that resulted.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Arylphenothiazines and N,N&#8208;Diarylphenazines as Tailored Organophotoredox Catalysts for the Reductive Activation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A small library of N&#8208;arylphenothiazines, N&#8208;arylbenzo[b]phenothiazines and N,N&#8208;diarylphenazines has been synthesized as strongly reducing organophotocatalysts without the need for sacrificial reagents or electrochemistry. Their opto&#8208;electronic properties and their suitability as organophotoredox catalysts for the efficient activation of olefins was investigated using the addition of methanol to &#945;&#8208;methylstyrene as a model reaction. The findings were supported by DFT calculations. Three photocatalysts were identified that allowed quantitative yields with 10 mol% catalyst loading and 20 h irradiation by a 365 nm LED. The catalyst loading was gradually reduced to 0.5 mol% and the irradiation time was reduced to only 20 min. These experiments revealed that N,N&#8208;diisobutyl&#8208;4'&#8208;(10H&#8208;phenothiazin&#8208;10&#8208;yl)&#8208;[1,1'&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;amine is the most efficient photocatalyst among the N&#8208;arylphenothiazines. This chromophore combines high electron density introduced by the diisobutylamino phenyl group with high absorptivity at 365 nm caused by the phenylene bridge to the phenothiazine core. In an attempt to shift the excitation wavelength into the visible light range for selectivity and sustainability purposes (potential use of sunlight as a light source), N&#8208;arylbenzo[b]phenothiazines N,N&#8208;diarylphenazines were designed that exhibit a red&#8208;shifted and broad absorbance shoulder into the visible range, but only N,N&#8208;diarylphenazines allow photocatalysis and the one&#8208;electron activation of alkenes by visible light (450 nm LED).</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyst&#8208;free Synthesis of&#160;Oxindoles and Isoquinolinediones via the&#160;Radical Reaction of N&#8208;Arylacrylamides with Monoalkyl Cesium Oxalate Salts by Visible Light Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photocatalyst&#8208;free cascade reaction of N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;arylmethacrylamides with monoalkyl cesium oxalate salts is described. In the presence of visible light and (NH4)2S2O8, monoalkyl cesium oxalate salts undergo single&#8208;electron oxidation/CO2 extrusion to generate alkyl radicals, followed by the addition and subsequent cyclization to give alkylated oxindoles. In addition, N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;methacryloylbenzamides could be applied for the cascade reaction, providing a series of alkylated isoquinolinediones, which are completely different from the products obtained with monoalkyl oxalates as substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Developments in C&#8208;S, C&#8208;Se Bond Formation via Three&#8208;Component Reactions of Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkynes are valuable building blocks in organic synthesis. They can undergo three&#8208;component difunctionalization to create sulfur or selenium&#8208;containing compounds. Three&#8208;component reactions of alkynes are atom economic, practical and regioselective. This review will disscuss decade developments, including C&#8208;S and C&#8208;Se bond formation via thiolation, sulfonylation and selenylation. Recent developments can be mainly categorized into three types. (1) Radical C&#8208;S/S&#8208;Se bond formation is a hot topic. Reactions initiated by S/Se radicals or other radicals exhibit two types of selectivities. Photochemical and electrochemical reactions under eco&#8208;friendly conditions have been increasingly reported. (2) Some transformations involve electrophilic three&#8208;membered ring intermediates. Thiiraniums, seleniraniums, and iodoniums are among the most prevalent species. They undergo ring&#8208;opening by various nucleophiles and participate in tandem reactions. (3) Metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions, a classic category, will also be discussed in the text. In the following section, we will provide an overview based on the mechanisms and substrates. The roles of added reagents will also be discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Macrocyclization for the Synthesis of Planar&#8208;Chiral Cyclophanes: Recent Updates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The planar chirality of macrocycles is a fascinating research topic. Locking the configurational flip between the benzene ring and macrocycle leads to planar chirality, which can significantly enhance the biological activity of cyclophanes. Planar&#8208;chiral cyclophanes are widely used in pharmaceuticals, chiral catalysts, and functional materials. However, accessing planar&#8208;chiral cyclophanes via asymmetric catalysis has remained challenging. Among the various strategies, asymmetric macrocyclization provides a powerful tool for accessing planar&#8208;chiral cyclophanes. This method allows for control of the planar chirality when constructing the macrocycle and greatly improves the efficiency. There are three types of macrocyclization reactions: transition metal&#8208;catalyzed, organocatalyzed, and biocatalyzed. In addition, the chiral confinement strategy breaks through conservative synthetic approaches. This review summarizes these achievements, aiming to highlight the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of cyclophanes and inspire interested researchers.</dc:description>

         <title>Denitrative Functionalization of Nitroarenes: Recent Progress and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitroarenes are fundamental feedstocks in the chemical industry. Their relatively inert C&#8722;NO2 bond allows for late&#8208;stage modifications of molecules and exhibits complete orthogonality to the reactivity of C&#8722;halogen bond in cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The denitrative functionalization of nitroarenes holds significant appeal due to it avoids the use of aryl halides, thereby simplifying reaction steps and improving atom and step economy. Recent progress in direct denitrative functionalization of nitroarenes includes palladium&#8208;catalyzed denitrative coupling, copper&#8208;catalyzed denitrative coupling, as well as metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot C&#8722;NO2 functionalization. In this review, we provide a concise overview of these advancements, detailing the reaction features and mechanisms. This summary aims to highlight the versatility and efficiency of denitrative functionalization methodologies, offering insights into their potential applications and inspiring further research in this promising area of organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;Promoted Regioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Amino BODIPYs through Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling with Anilines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of &#945;&#8208;amino BODIPYs were synthesized through a base&#8208;promoted oxidative cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling with air as a green oxidant. Furthermore, these newly synthesized BODIPYs showed potential applications as organic probes.







Abstract
The construction of C&#8722;N bond at the &#945;&#8208;position of BODIPYs (boron dipyrromethene) not only enables flexible reactivity but also leads to strong electron&#8208;donating properties. In this study, a base&#8208;promoted oxidative cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling was developed to synthesize &#945;&#8208;amino BODIPYs with air as a green oxidant. By this strategy, a series of weak nitrogen nucleophiles, such as heteroaryl and aryl anilines, were installed to the &#945;&#8208;position. Remarkably, pyrrole, pyrazole and indole were also employed to realize the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;heteroaryl BODIPYs through direct functionalization. Further aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIE) properties and lipid droplet&#8208;targeting bioimaging experiments of representative dyes demonstrated their potential applications as organic probes.

         <title>Electroreduction Reactions Mediated by Organic Molecules: Recent Advances and Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electroreduction is an important aspect of organic electrochemistry. Its chemistry does not require the addition of additional reductants, making it an effective alternative to various traditional reduction reactions. Among them, organo&#8208;mediated electroreduction is recognized as a promising approach. Organo&#8208;mediators can be reduced directly at the cathode to form reactive radical anions that subsequently reduce the substrate via electron transfer (ET) to initiate the reaction being investigated. Organo&#8208;mediators typically have a more positive reduction potential, and their role in the whole reaction is similar to that of catalysts. Their addition transforms the ET process from the original heterogeneous process into a homogeneous one. Organo&#8208;mediated electroreduction can effectively avoid the over&#8208;electrolysis of the substrate and the product at the electrode and the intolerance of sensitive substrates or functional groups during electrolysis, thereby preventing the occurrence of side reactions. It can also prevent the excessive consumption of reagents and electrical energy while promoting the reaction to achieve higher or completely different selectivity. Considering the advantages of this type of reaction, this review will provide a detailed description of electroreduction reactions mediated by organic molecules in recent years and elucidate the mechanism of the organo&#8208;mediators in the transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Silver/Segphos&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition for the Enantioselective Synthesis of Pyrrolidine Spirooxindoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselective synthesis of chiral heterocyclic derivatives is an important and challenging topic in the field of synthetic chemistry. In this work, a silver&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of glycine iminoesters with 3&#8208;isopropylidene&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles was developed. The DTBM&#8208;Segphos&#8208;induced spirooxindole cycloaddition reaction was used to synthesize a range of stereodivergent alkyl&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;methylene&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles, achieving excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee), good diastereoselectivities (up to 20:1 dr), and high yields under mild reaction conditions. Computational insights from DFT calculations indicate that the Michael addition step is crucial in determining the reaction rate and enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Stability, Meisenheimer Complex Formation, and Charge&#8208;Transfer Properties of Ultra&#8208;Electron&#8208;Deficient Tetracyano&#8208;Naphthalene Diimides</title>

         <dc:description>
We established an improved synthetic route to TCNDIs with cost&#8208;effective reagents and circumventing metallic catalysts. The synthesis is amenable to TCNDIs with the shortest axial alkyl groups and also to longer alkyl chains. How the axial alkyl chain lengths influence electron&#8208;deficiency, reactivity, and charge&#8208;transfer of TCNDIs, is herein explored.







Abstract
Tetra&#8208;cyano substituted naphthalene diimides (TCNDIs) with calculated LUMO of &#8722;5.2&#8197;eV, form one of the strongest electron&#8208;acceptors known to date. However, the synthesis and isolation of this class of molecules remain challenging due to its reactivity emanating from its ultra&#8208;electron&#8208;deficiency. Herein we have established an improved synthetic methodology of TCNDIs with cost&#8208;effective reagents and circumventing metallic catalysts. The synthesis is amenable to TCNDIs with the shortest axial alkyl groups, i.&#8201;e., methyl group and also longer alkyl chains. We also gained insight on how axial alkyl chain lengths influence electron&#8208;deficiency, Meisenheimer complex formation, reactivity, and charge&#8208;transfer of TCNDIs from computation, spectroscopy, and electrochemical studies. The TCNDIs with Me/Et axial groups were found to be more susceptible to moist solvents vis&#8208;&#224;&#8208;vis the TCNDIs with longer alkyl groups. The single crystal structures of the TCNDIs show infinitely &#960;&#8208;stacked structure, and a new C=O&#8201;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8201;C&#8801;N or C&#8801;N&#8201;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8201;&#960; motif is discerned. Finally, toluene&#8208;mediated charge&#8208;transfer properties of TCNDIs in the single crystals as well as in solution have been examined.

         <title>Reconstructive Approach to the Regiospecific Synthesis of N9&#8208;Alkylated Purines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 32, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regiospecific pathway to N9&#8208;alkylated purines as novel acyclic nucleoside analogs has been developed by using reconstructive methodology. The method is characterized by mild and scalable conditions, straightforward workup, high to excellent yields, and a metal&#8208;free final step, and the efficiency of the approach was demonstrated by the synthesis of a close structural analog of penciclovir.







Abstract
A regiospecific synthesis of N9&#8208;alkylated purines as novel acyclic nucleosides was developed. This approach is based on reconstructive methodology involving the construction of a target heterocyclic scaffold on a readily available 5&#8208;aminotetrazole moiety, which is subsequently cleaved under reductive conditions due to azido&#8208;tetrazole tautomerism. It appeared that the rate of reduction for the azide fragment in 6&#8208;nitro&#8208;7&#8208;alkylaminotetrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines is much greater than the rate of nitro group reduction. Treatment of these heterocycles with hydrogen over a palladium catalyst resulted in the formation of triaminopyrimidines in excellent yields through the reduction of both the azide and nitro group. Triaminopyrimidines were transformed into the desired N9&#8208;alkylated purines, and an analog of the marketed drug penciclovir was synthesized by the developed method.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Oxidation of Silanes with SF6 for Efficient Synthesis of Siloxanes</title>

         <dc:description>
A synthesis of siloxanes via visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced oxidation of silanes with SF6 has been established, exhibiting broad substrate scope and high efficiency.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced strategy utilizing sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) as distinctive oxidant and water as the oxygen source to transform silanes into siloxanes has been developed under mild conditions, realizing the efficient utilization and degradation of the strong greenhouse gas, sulfur hexafluoride, simultaneously. Mechanistic experiments demonstrate that the reaction proceeds through a radical pathway, and it has been confirmed that the oxygen atoms in the resulting siloxanes indeed originate from water by isotopic labeling experiments with 18O.

         <title>Phthalimide and 3&#8208;Formylindole Derivatives for Oligonucleotide Conjugation by Amide or Oxime Ligation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 32, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phthalimide&#8208;hexyl or 3&#8208;formylindole&#8208;hexyl phosphoramidites and solid supports on a tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane scaffold were used to introduce an amine or aldehyde function into oligonucleotides for conjugation by amide bond or oxime ligation.







Abstract
A phthalimide or 3&#8208;formylindole functionality was incorporated into a tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane (THME) scaffold, and the resulting compounds were subsequently transformed into phosphoramidites and solid supports. These building blocks were then used to synthesise oligonucleotides containing amine or aldehyde groups at various positions within their sequences. The resulting modified oligonucleotides were further conjugated through either amide bond formation or oxime ligation. These novel building blocks expand the repertoire of phosphoramidites and solid supports available for modifying oligonucleotides.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Catalyst and Additive&#8208;Free C(sp3)&#8208;H Phosphorylation of Glycine Ester Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 32, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, efficient and environmentally friendly method is proposed for the synthesis of a series of structurally diverse phosphine&#8208;glycine derivatives by direct irradiation of glycine derivatives and diarylphosphine oxides with blue visible light at room temperature using only air (oxygen) as an oxidant. A possible mechanism was also proposed in conjunction with controlled experiments.







Abstract
We herein report a visible light induced dehydrogenative phosphonylation reaction of glycine derivatives and di&#8208;aryl phosphine oxides. A diverse range of phosphine&#8208;glycine derivatives were constructed under ambient condition in the absence of catalyst and additives. A plausible mechanism was also proposed.

         <title>Electrochemical Decarboxylation/Mumm Rearrangement towards Imides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 32, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemically promoted decarboxylation of readily available carboxylic acid and subsequent Mumm rearrangement to synthesize imides was reported. The reaction features external oxidant&#8208;free, transition metal&#8208;free mild conditions, and good functional group tolerance, affording various imides in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
We report an electrochemically promoted decarboxylation of readily available carboxylic acid and subsequent Mumm rearrangement to synthesize the corresponding imides. The reaction features external oxidant&#8208;free, transition metal&#8208;free mild conditions, and good functional group tolerance, affording various imides in moderate to good yields. Mechanistic studies reveal that the selective oxidation of aliphatic carboxylic acids appears to be the key step in this transformation.

         <title>Electro&#8208;Organic Stereoselective Dehydrogenative Homo&#8208;Coupling of &#946;&#8208;Naphthylamines Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 32, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical stereoselective dehydrogenative homocoupling of enantiopure &#946;&#8208;naphthylamines featuring an aminoalcohol as chiral auxiliary led to the chiral 2,2&#8217;&#8208;binaphthyl diamine derivatives in up to 60&#8201;% yield and 96/4 diastereoisomeric ratio.







Abstract
The electrochemical stereoselective dehydrogenative homocoupling of &#946;&#8208;naphthylamine derivatives was investigated and successfully accomplished, the chiral diaryl amines being obtained in up to 60&#8201;% yield. The use of an enantiopure &#946;&#8208;naphthylamine featuring an aminoalcohol as chiral auxiliary led to the expected 2,2&#8217;&#8208;binaphthyl diamine derivative in up to 96/4 diastereoisomeric ratio. The application of the methodology to the intramolecular cross coupling of the enantiopure bis&#8208;N&#8208;&#946;&#8208;naphthylamine 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;diamino cyclohexane led to the formation of a single enantiopure diastereoisomer in 37&#8201;% yield.

         <title>Diaminomethylation of Pyrazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 32, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Alkyl(aryl)pyrazoles react with silylformamidine that exists in an equilibrium with its carbene form via migration of the trimethylsilyl group from the carbon to nitrogen atom inserting at C&#8722;H group in 5th position. N&#8208;Alkyl(aryl)pyrazoles featuring substituents such as Br, CN and NO2 readily afford the corresponding aminals.







Abstract
We studied the reaction of N&#8208;alkyl(aryl)pyrazoles with silylformamidine 1 that exists in an equilibrium with its carbene form via migration of the trimethylsilyl group from the carbon to nitrogen atom. The carbene insertion proceeded at the C&#8722;H group in 5th position. N&#8208;alkyl(aryl)pyrazoles featuring substituents such as Br, CN and NO2 group reacted readily affording the corresponding aminals. This approach allowed us to synthesize pyrazole dialdehyde and phosphine featuring a vicinal aldehyde group. The reaction does not require any catalyst. The insertion position was unambiguously confirmed by X&#8208;ray analysis of an aminal and a set of derivatives. Aminals hydrolysis afforded the corresponding pyrazole carbaldehydes. Methanolysis of the aminals gave N&#8208;methylimines of the pyrazolecarbaldehydes. Highly acidic nitro pyrazole instead of the insertion underwent silylation in 5th position.

         <title>Photoinduced Remote Selective C(sp3)&#8722;H Alkylation Mediated by Cesium Formate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 32, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoinduced cesium formate mediated remote selective C(sp3)&#8722;H alkylation of protected amines were developed under mild reaction conditions in absence of external photocatalyst. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the cesium formate act as a source of carbon dioxide radical anion and hydrogen atom donor.







Abstract
Herein, we developed a photoinduced remote selective C(sp3)&#8722;H alkylation of protected amines in the presence of cesium formate. The protected amines were synthesized from commercially available inexpensive 2&#8208;iodo benzoyl chloride. Under mild reaction conditions, the in&#8197;situ generated aryl radical is converted to &#945;&#8208;amidoalkyl radical via [1,5]&#8208;HAT process, which combines with different Michael acceptors and affords corresponding alkylation products in good yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that formate anion acts as a source of carbon dioxide radical anion (CO2&#8901;&#8722;) and hydrogen atom donor was directly confirmed by isotope&#8208;labeling studies.

         <title>Preparation and Aldol Couplings of 3(2H)&#8208;Furanones: Stereoselective Synthesis of the C8&#8208;C22 Fragment of Tuscoron A</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 32, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reliable protocols for synthesis of furan&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were developed and the resulting heterocycles were coupled to elaborate aldehydes in aldol couplings and condensations in good to high selectivity. Application of these methods allowed for a concise and highly stereroselective synthesis of the C8&#8208;C22 fragment of the complex polyketide natural product tuscoron A.







Abstract
Various strategies for synthesis and stereroselective aldol coupling of furan&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were evaluated that eventually enabled a highly stereroselective synthesis of the C8&#8208;C22 fragment of tuscoron A.

         <dc:description>
Multigram synthesis of 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;monofluorinated cyclobutane building blocks was disclosed. In both cases, fluorocyclobutanecarboxylic acids were the key intermediates used to obtain all other derivatives, e.&#8201;g., amines, alcohols, bromides, thiols, sulfonyl chlorides, etc. For both target chemotypes, diastereopure cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;isomers of the corresponding carboxylic acids and amines were obtained through diastereomer separation. Characterization of 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;fluorocyclobutyl substituents by pKa and LogP measurements for the model derivatives was also performed.







Abstract
Multigram synthesis of 3&#8208;fluorinated cyclobutane building blocks has been disclosed. The proposed synthetic schemes were based on nucleophilic fluorination and eventually led to 3&#8208;fluorocyclocutanecarboxylic acid as a key target compound and intermediate. Further functional group transformations provided monofluorinated cyclobutane&#8208;derived alcohols, amines, bromides, thiols, sulfonyl chlorides, etc. Furthermore, the synthesis of diastereopure cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;isomeric 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;fluorocyclobutanecarboxylic acids and amines was also performed. In both cases, diastereomer separation was used to obtain pure stereoisomers. The effect of the fluorine position and relative spatial orientation on the physicochemical properties of the corresponding monoflurinated derivatives was studied by measurements of pKa and logP values.

         <title>Cyclic Nitronates via Sugar&#8208;Derived Nitroalkenes in a Hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder/[3,3]&#8208;Sigmatropic Rearrangement Pathway</title>

         <dc:description>
This research explores the synthesis of cyclic nitronates from sugar&#8208;derived nitroalkenes through a hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder/[3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement. The method enables efficient access to diverse chemically stable and structurally interesting nitronic esters, which are pivotal in organic synthesis. DFT computational calculations are in satisfactory agreement with experimental data. These structures offering potential applications in medicinal chemistry and natural product development.







Abstract
Diels&#8208;Alder between nitroalkenes derived from a sugar scaffold and cyclopentadiene were examined. Depending on chemical structure of nitroalkene and polarity of solvent used, the reaction proceeded via the formation of a nitronate intermediate. Cyclic nitronates highly functionalized were obtained as chemically stable and stereochemically pure compounds. [3,3] sigmatropic shift of these ones afforded the Diels Alder cycloadducts in quantitative yield. Mechanistic aspects of reaction between nitroalkenes and cyclopentadiene has been studied using DFT computational methods. Nitronate derivatives are attractive intermediates and open the way for the construction of valuable compounds with potential applications.

         <title>Front Cover: Reconstructive Approach to the Regiospecific Synthesis of N9&#8208;Alkylated Purines (Eur. J. Org. Chem. 32/2024)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 32, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover illustrates a reconstructive strategy for the regiospecific synthesis of novel acyclic purine nucleoside analogs. This methodology is inspired by a butterfly&#8208;life cycle, which starts with an egg (aminoguanidine) that transforms into a caterpillar (5&#8208;aminotetrazole) that forms a chrysalis (6&#8208;nitro&#8208;7&#8208;alkylaminotetrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines). The last one serves as a basis to transform into a beautiful butterfly (desired purine nucleoside analogs including Penciclovir&#8208;like molecule) that breaks out of its shell (destructive reduction of tetrazole cycle along with nitrogroup) to spread wings. More information can be found in the Research Article by K.&#8197;V. Savateev and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/ejoc.202400426). Cover design by Lena Stern.

Nitroalkenes and dienes play the game of pericyclic cycloadditions: In this work, we present an exhaustive experimental study of the hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder and the [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of structurally related nitroalkenes derived from carbohydrates and cyclopentadiene. DFT calculations nicely agreed with the obtained results. Enantiomerically pure and chemically stable functionalized cyclic nitronates were prepared. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.&#8197;I. Mangione and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/ejoc.202400650).

         <title>(Radio)Fluorination Reactions for the Synthesis of Aryl Fluorides: Recent Advances and Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 32, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic fluorination and radiofluorination reactions offer a potent approach to synthesizing a variety of compounds that feature a fluorine atom. Organic fluorinated compounds have widespread applications in various fields, encompassing agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and materials science. This review summarizes recent advancements in the field and highlights notable accomplishments achieved.







Abstract
The formation of carbon&#8208;fluorine (C&#8722;F) bonds is an important research field in organic synthesis because inserting a fluorine atom into an organic compound can alter its physicochemical properties, such as metabolic stability and permeability. Due to this unique property, organic fluorinated compounds, especially aryl fluorides, have a wide range of applications in various fields, including agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and materials science. Therefore, numerous metal&#8208; or metal&#8208;free&#8208;mediated fluorination reactions have been developed to synthesize aryl fluorides. In this mini&#8208;review, we summarize recent ten years&#8217; advances in fluorination reactions for the synthesis of aryl fluorides.

         <title>Diethyl Mesoxalate, A Representative Tricarbonyl Compound &#8211; A Useful Synthetic Tool Possessing Diverse Reactivities</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diethyl mesoxalate, a vicinal tricarbonyl compound, possesses multiple functionalities that facilitate diverse chemical conversions. The central carbonyl group with two ester functionalities exhibits high electrophilicity to accept nucleophilic attacks of various reagents. This unusual electrophilicity enables the reaction with acid amides that are not common nucleophiles in organic syntheses. Condensation with active methylene compounds or amines leads to electron&#8208;deficient alkenes and imines, respectively, which can be transformed into more complex polyfunctionalized compounds by a second nucleophilic addition. Chemical transformations between the central and adjacent ester carbonyls furnish new ring systems that are useful in material and pharmaceutical sciences. The central carbonyl group can also be built into a ring system by reacting with reagents possessing nucleophilic and electrophilic sites. Furthermore, the central carbonyl serves as a dienophile that undergoes cycloaddition to form functionalized heterocyclic compounds in a single step.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regioselectively arylated heteroarenes are privileged scaffolds with remarkable biological and optoelectronic properties. Traditional arylation approaches based on the transition&#8208;metal catalysis present various issues related to the cost of synthesis and environmental sustainability. The growing applications of arylheteroarenes in pharmaceuticals and cutting&#8208;edge technologies have fuelled interest in the development of green and cost&#8208;effective synthetic approaches. This article reports the recent progress in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free strategies for the regioselective C&#8208;H arylation/heteroarylation of heteroarenes.

         <title>PHOTOINDUCED INTRAMOLECULAR C&#8211;N COUPLING FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF AZOLO[1,2,4]BENZOTHIADIAZINES DERIVATIVES</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: This paper explores an original synthesis of novel heterocyclic compounds derived from photoinduced intramolecular coupling reactions, involving the formation of C&#8208;N and C&#8208;C bonds. Specifically, two classes of compounds were targeted: 4H&#8208;benzo[e]pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;b][1,2,4]thiadiazines and 5&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;thia&#8208;4,5a&#8208;diazaacephenanthrylenes. The synthetic strategy involved nucleophilic substitution reactions to prepare key sulfonamide starting substrates, followed by photoinduced cyclization (via the Substitution Radical Nucleophilic Unimolecular, SRN1) under mild conditions using visible light. The scope of the reaction was explored with different substituent groups on the starting materials, which demonstrated moderate to very good product yields, with 13 examples and yields of up to 78%. Moreover, this strategy represents the first synthetic approach to obtain 5&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;thia&#8208;4,5a&#8208;diazaphenanthrylenes.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient photocatalysis has been developed for the synthesis of indanone using low&#8208;energy green light as input energy. This methodology provides a greener avenue to construct indanone through a metal&#8208;free photocatalytic radical annulation reaction between &#945;&#8208;keto acid and internal alkyne.







Abstract
Low&#8208;energy light, endowing with excellent characteristics of lower energy, fewer side reactions, more abundance in solar light. The scenario has been developed for the fabrication of indenone through a low&#8208;energy green light driven radical annulation reaction between &#945;&#8208;keto acids and internal alkynes using Rhodamine 6G as photocatalyst. Various kinds of substrates are suitable for this methodology, affording the corresponding indenones in a greener and efficient manner.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective provides an overview of recent homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic methodologies published on the CO2 cycloaddition to aziridines to form oxazolidinones, with a particular attention to the employed experimental conditions, which are essential parameters for envisioning real costs and possible applications of these synthetic processes.







Abstract
This perspective discusses bibliography data that has been published since 2018 on the synthesis of oxazolidinones by reacting corresponding aziridines with CO2. The versatility and viability of various procedures have been analyzed by considering the variety of tested substrates as well as experimental conditions and catalytic systems used. Collected data highlights that the reaction can be effectively promoted by several homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems that have been optimized in order to conjugate the process sustainability and productivity with convenient procedural costs.

&lt;p&gt;This perspective discusses bibliography data that has been published since 2018 on the synthesis of oxazolidinones by reacting corresponding aziridines with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The versatility and viability of various procedures have been analyzed by considering the variety of tested substrates as well as experimental conditions and catalytic systems used. Collected data highlights that the reaction can be effectively promoted by several homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems that have been optimized in order to conjugate the process sustainability and productivity with convenient procedural costs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On the Role of the Solvent in the Synthesis of Spirocycles from Alkyne Cations Catalyzed by Triflic Acid: A DFT Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not merely a spectator. The competitive cyclization/elimination mechanisms of an alkyne cation to yield either a spiroketone or and enyne have been studied computationally. Analysis of the respective reaction coordinates shows the crucial role of one discrete molecule of solvent that determines the experimentally observed outcome.







Abstract
The relevance of solvent molecules in the reactivity of alkyne cations has been analyzed computationally. Analysis of the possible reaction mechanisms towards competitive cyclization and elimination processes including a molecule of solvent shows the crucial role of the solvent. In dichloromethane there are no relevant discrete solvent&#8208;cation interactions that could determine the outcome and a strong intramolecular &#960;&#8208;cation interaction favors the [5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig] cyclization route. On the other hand, in tetrahydrofuran or toluene solvated environments, the existence of solvent&#8208;cation interaction via formation of a dative C&#8722;O bond or the formation of a highly stabilized triflate&#8208;cation complex, respectively, modifies the energy profile, thus promoting the elimination pathway.

         <title>Chromium&#8208;Mediated Dearomative Allylic Addition to Arenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In comparison with the well&#8208;established allylic additions to C=O, C=N, and C=C double bonds, the dearomative allylic addition to arene &#960;&#8208;systems is heavily underdeveloped due to the severe challenge in breaking aromatic resonance stabilization. Herein, we disclose a general and efficient dearomative allylic addition to chromium&#8208;bound arenes using allylsilanes as the pronucleophiles, thus affording convenient access to allyl&#8208;functionalized 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene building blocks. With commercially available deuterium sources, the versatility of this strategy further enables an arene dearomative 1,2&#8208;deuteroallylation with a high level of deuterium incorporation. Finally, a preliminary try on the asymmetric dearomative hydroallylation based on a chiral auxiliary strategy is described.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective and Triggered Decomposition of Diazo Esters by the [(IMes)Rh2(OAc)4] Complex: En Route to Assisted Tandem Catalysis from Mixtures of Diazo Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Start and stop: electron poor diazo compounds cannot give rise to carbene&#8208;mediated transformations at room temperature under [(IMes)Rh2(OAc)4] catalysis but their reactivity can be restored on demand by external stimuli (heat or addition of a Lewis acid).







Abstract
Decomposition of aryl and unsubstituted diazo ester into Rh(II)&#8208;carbenes by the [(IMes)Rh2(OAc)4] complex is shown to be slower than with Rh2(OAc)4. Diazo esters substituted by a second electron&#8208;withdrawing group do not suffer nitrogen extrusion when exposed for several hours to this (NHC)Rh(II) complex at room temperature. This chemoselective decomposition of diazo esters depending on their substituent (Ar, H, EWG) can furthermore be achieved on a mixture of substrates. The catalytic activity of [(IMes)Rh2(OAc)4] towards electron&#8208;poor diazo compounds is also restored by heating to reflux in chloroform, or after decomplexation of the NHC by addition of GaCl3. The [(IMes)Rh2(OAc)4] complex was then used to induce a fully selective reaction cascade from a mixture of two diazo esters. First, a donor/acceptor diazo compound was decomposed selectively at room temperature to give an intermolecular O&#8722;H insertion product without any decomposition of the electron poor diazo compound. Addition of GaGl3 then triggered nitrogen extrusion from the diazo malonate to give a 1,5&#8208;C&#8722;H insertion product. This transformation, where decomposition of diazo compounds catalyzed by Rh(II) complexes can be externally controlled, represents the first example of assisted tandem catalysis with two metal carbene precursors.

         <title>Nonheme Fe Based Enzyme Mimics for Fine Organic Synthesis: Catalytic C&#8722;H and C=C Oxygenations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept discusses the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of bioinspired non&#8208;heme Fe catalyzed oxidations of organic molecules and analyzes the peculiarities of their catalytic reactivity which may be in demand for the synthesis of oxyfunctionalized molecules of variable complexity.







Abstract
Since the milestone contribution by Chen and White in 2007, bioinspired non&#8208;heme bis&#8208;amino&#8208;bis&#8208;pyridylmethyl Fe complexes have been at the forefront of studies related to designing catalytic approaches for direct oxidative functionalization of aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds. This, however, has not developed into large&#8208;scale synthetic applications to date. The present concept is aimed at briefly discussing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of non&#8208;heme Fe catalyzed oxidations of organic molecules with H2O2, the current oxidant of choice of bioinspired oxidation catalysis, mostly focusing on C&#8722;H oxidations, and analyzing the peculiarities of their reactivity through the prism of potential applications in fine organic synthesis.

         <title>Sustainable Domino C&#8722;N/C&#8722;C Bond Formation with Outstanding E Factors and High Volume Productivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This newly developed single&#8208;flask, solvent&#8208;free process accomplishes sequential C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C bond formations. It leads to (&#946;&#8208;cyano)anilines by use of aryl triflates, Schiff bases, and CH3CN as a reagent. Key features of this neat method include a domino process, ambient temperature, short reaction time, and alignment with sustainability principles.







Abstract
One of the primary concerns in the development of new chemical reactions pertains to the choice of solvents, many of which can have harmful ecological impacts. Additionally, a major portion of waste generated in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries comes from the solvents employed. The elimination of solvent usage is highly desirable for creation of environmentally friendly chemical processes as it leads to a substantial reduction in waste production. Accordingly, a novel neat reaction was developed for the synthesis of (&#946;&#8208;amino)nitriles as a prominent moiety through a domino process. It involved the use of silylphenyl triflates, Schiff bases, and acetonitrile (CH3CN) in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio, among which CH3CN served as a starting material rather than a solvent. This reaction was initiated by caesium fluoride (CsF) to form an aryne through 1,2&#8208;elimination followed by sequential 1,2&#8208;addition, proton transfer, and a second 1,2&#8208;addition. Complete conversion was carried out at 25&#8201;&#176;C for 1.0&#8197;h to give (&#946;&#8208;amino)nitriles in 76&#8211;88&#8201;% yields. This solvent&#8208;free reaction minimized waste production and reduced costs associated with extra reagents, solvents, and labour. It possesses a compelling E factor and impressive volume productivity. This reaction sets a new benchmark for solvent&#8208;free aryne domino processes in green chemistry advancements.

         <title>Intramolecular Photochemical C&#8211;H Insertions of &#945;&#8208;Diazocarbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intramolecular photochemical C&#8211;H insertion reactions of &#945;&#8208;diazocarbonyl compounds are powerful synthetic transformations leading to carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation. While there are limitations in the scope of C&#8211;H bonds amenable to C&#8211;H insertion under photochemical conditions relative to metal catalysed C&#8211;H insertions, the benefits of conducting these synthetically powerful transformations in a metal&#8208;free approach offers &#8220;green&#8221; advantages. Recent advances in technology have revolutionised the potential for use of photochemical transformations in synthesis, including the wavelength control enabled by LEDs and the benefits associated with continuous flow processing which overcome many of the traditional challenges associated with synthetic photochemistry including scale&#8208;up. The potential for telescoping the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;diazocarbonyl compounds and downstream photochemical reactions is clear. This review summarises the development of intramolecular photochemical C&#8211;H insertions and highlights the benefits of recent technological advances.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki and Heck reactions are&#160;two of the most common carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation reactions. Gold, unlike other transition metals (Pd, Ni, and Cu), offers unique reactivity profiles, and has emerged as an efficient tool in the field of synthetic organic chemistry. This mini&#8208;review focused on the recent work in gold&#8208;catalyzed Heck and Suzuki&#8208;type reactions, especially by photocatalysts or ligand design, which show reactivities and features distinct from other transition metals. These discoveries will further facilitate the development of gold redox catalysis as well as applications in organic synthesis, biochemistry, and medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of the Indolo[2,3&#8208;&#945;]quinolizine Alkaloid (+)&#8208;Cuscutamine via a Diastereoselective Intramolecular Pictet&#8208;Spengler Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise total synthesis of the natural product (11S, 13R)&#8208;Cuscutamine was achieved involving a diastereoselective intramolecular acyl iminium ion mediated Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction. The diastereoselectivity of the reaction is consistent with previous studies that proceed via more highly puckered transition states and the present results thus reveals the importance of the steric contribution to the diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
A concise total synthesis of Cuscutamine was achieved involving a diastereoselective intramolecular acyl iminium ion mediated Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction. This synthetic strategy provided a direct route to (11S, 13R)&#8208;Cuscutamine (2) in only 3 steps with an overall yield of 56&#8201;% and an enantiomeric ratio of 88&#8201;%. The diastereoselectivity of the reaction is consistent with previous studies that proceed via more highly puckered transition states and the present results thus reveal the importance of the steric contributions to the observed diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Iodonium Salt&#8208;Mediated Oxidation of Sulfides to Sulfoxides by DMSO</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel iodonium salt mediated methodology activating sulfur atom, promoting the conversion of sulfides into sulfoxides exploiting DMSO as the sole oxidant. An easy access to pharmaceutical active compounds such as Sulforaphane and Modafinil.







Abstract
Compounds bearing the sulfoxide moiety display an important class of molecules in pharmaceutical industry. Many efforts have been made towards the development of novel, sustainable, easy&#8208;to&#8208;execute and industrially friendly processes. A novel iodonium&#8208;salt&#8208;mediated oxidation protocol for the conversion of sulfides into the corresponding sulfoxides is reported, employing DMSO as the oxidant. Several sulfides decorated with various functional groups were tested, leading to the corresponding products in good to excellent yields with remarkable chemoselectivity. The oxidation protocol was successfully applied to the synthesis of the pharmaceutical active ingredients (APIs) Sulforaphane and Modafinil.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of a Tetrasaccharide Repeating Unit of O&#8208;Antigen from Escherichia Coli O33</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetrasaccharide repeating unit of the O&#8208;antigen from Escherichia coli O33 was synthesized by using a one&#8208;pot glycosylation strategy. The successful synthesis of the tetrasaccharide is significant for the creation of vaccines targeting E. coli O33.







Abstract
A tetrasaccharide repeating unit of the O&#8208;antigen from Escherichia coli O33 has been synthesized for the first time using a chemoselective [1+1+2] one&#8208;pot glycan assembly strategy. The phosphoglycerol moiety was installed by using the phosphoramidite method with benzylidene&#8208;protected glycerol 2&#8208;phosphoramidite as the reagent. Overall, the target tetrasaccharide was synthesized from monosaccharide building blocks in 12 linear steps, resulting in a satisfactory yield of 28&#8201;%.

         <title>Difluorocarbene Enables Modular Synthesis of Difluoroalkylated Bicyclopentanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach for the modular synthesis of difluoroalkylated bicyclopentanes has been developed. As shown above, this protocol involves a stepwise procedure and features synthetic simplicity and structural diversity without tedious synthesis of difluoroalkylating reagents.







Abstract
A straightforward method for the synthesis of difluoroalkylated bicyclopentanes (BCPs) from [1.1.1]propellane (TCP) through a stepwise procedure has been developed. This process involves nucleophilic addition of organozinc or ArMgBr reagents to TCP, followed by reaction with difluorocarbene to generate BCP substituted difluoroalkylzinc species, which subsequently couple with electrophiles, including allyl/propargyl bromides, (hetero)aryl disulfides, and proton, to provide a wide range of difluoroalkylated BCPs that otherwise are difficult to access through conventional methods. The transformations of the resulting products demonstrate the synthetic utility of this modular synthesis.

&lt;p&gt;A straightforward method for the synthesis of difluoroalkylated bicyclopentanes (BCPs) from [1.1.1]propellane (TCP) through a stepwise procedure has been developed. This process involves nucleophilic addition of organozinc or ArMgBr reagents to TCP, followed by reaction with difluorocarbene to generate BCP substituted difluoroalkylzinc species, which subsequently couple with electrophiles, including allyl/propargyl bromides, (hetero)aryl disulfides, and proton, to provide a wide range of difluoroalkylated BCPs that otherwise are difficult to access through conventional methods. The transformations of the resulting products demonstrate the synthetic utility of this modular synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoactivated Hantzsch ester facilitates a mild, metal&#8208;free Giese&#8208;type hydrodifluoroalkylation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes through photoinduced electron transfer (PET) and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes, providing an easy access to diverse gem&#8208;difluorinated alkanes.







Abstract
A mild, metal&#8208;free Giese&#8208;type hydrodifluoroalkylation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes under visible&#8208;light irradiation has been developed. This highly reducing photoactivated Hantzsch ester facilitates C(sp3)&#8722;CF2 bond formation through photoinduced electron transfer (PET) and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes, providing an easy access to diverse gem&#8208;difluorinated alkanes.

         <title>Reduction and Hydrocyanation of Aziridines with C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unusual C&#8722;C bond cleavage of 2,3&#8208;diaryl aziridines took place to afford secondary amines by formal dihydrogenation and hydrocyanation. Formal dehydrogenation was performed by electrocyclic ring opening of N&#8208;Li or N&#8208;Na aziridines to azaallyl anions followed by reduction with NaBH4. Formal hydrocyanation was realized by treating azaallyl anions with Me3SiCN.







Abstract
The carbon&#8208;carbon bond in three&#8208;membered ring of 2,3&#8208;diaryl aziridines was reductively cleaved to give the corresponding dibenzylamine derivatives by electrocyclic ring opening of N&#8208;Li or N&#8208;Na aziridines followed by reduction of the 2&#8208;azaallyl anion formed with sodium borohydride in ethanol. Hydrocyanation of the 2&#8208;azaallyl anion with trimethylsilyl cyanide gave a secondary amine bearing a cyano group at the benzylic position. The effects of substituents on the electrocyclic ring opening of N&#8208;Li aziridines were also clarified.

         <title>Synthesis and Conformational Analysis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Dichlorocarbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facile dichlorination reactions of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides with TCIA&#8208;PPh3 and conversion of the resultant amides into ketones are described to confirm a previous hypothesis by 1H NMR spectroscopy: large coupling constants for 1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;dichlorides and small coupling constants for 1,2&#8208;syn&#8208;dichlorides. Unique conformational analyses of the products are discussed with the syn&#8208;pentane interaction although the hypothesis was not always supported.







Abstract
&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Dichlorocarbonyl compounds were synthesized by facile dichlorination of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides with TCIA&#8208;PPh3 and the resultant amides were converted to ketones. Conformational analyses of the products were performed to confirm our previous hypothesis regarding vicinal dichlorinated carbonyl compounds. The compounds exhibited 1H NMR signals with large coupling constants (7&#8211;11&#8197;Hz) for the 1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;configuration and small coupling constants (3&#8211;4&#8197;Hz) for the 1,2&#8208;syn&#8208;configuration. The syn&#8208;pentane interaction enabled rational conformational analysis of the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dichlorinated carbonyl compounds, although some interesting exceptions were observed. Consideration of these conformations is helpful in assigning relative configurations of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dihalogenated carbonyl compounds in general.

         <title>Heavy Atom Quantum Tunnelling in N&#8208;Heterocyclic Pentalenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heavy atom quantum tunnelling was already observed in several &#960;&#8208;bond&#8208;shifting reactions of antiaromatic molecules. In these, their Jahn&#8208;Teller distortions create sharp energy profiles with small atomic trajectories, which are ideal for observing tunnelling. Herein, we studied the effect of the nitrogen in the N&#8208;heterocyclic pentalenes, distinguishing between isothermic and exothermic reactions. The reactivity was not easily predictable, with our computations revealing a wide variability of rates, from the complete cancellation of the barrier to a high isomer stability. For all these systems, quantum tunnelling emerged as the most significant mechanism at room temperature and the only valid one at cryogenic conditions.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The field of organogermanium in chemistry has recently attracted attention. Thanks to the inherent features of germanium (Ge), introducing Ge&#8208;based substituents into organic frameworks has enhanced bioactivity and optoelectronic properties of molecules. Herein, the synthesis of multi&#8208;functionalized organogermaniums using Ge(II) salts is reported. The germacycles having an allylboron moiety, which is derived from the (4+1) cycloadditions of the butadienes bearing a boronic ester moiety with Ge(II) salts, can be applied to further allylboration of aldehydes with perfect diastereoselectivity. The obtained allylated adducts enable access to &#960;&#8208;extended organogermaniums with the retention of the stereocenters.</dc:description>

The mechanistic studies supported the effect of functional group on the catalytic activity of Pd/FPPOPs catalyst, which revealed that the weak coordination as well as non-covalent interaction between porous organic polymers and substrate played important role in the enhancement of chemoselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Utilization of Hypervalent Bonds as a Novel Strategy for Manipulating Energy Levels of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unique optical properties created by the combination of azobenzene&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems and hypervalent bonds are summarized. The hypervalent bond, a polarized three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8208;4e) bond, simultaneously provides electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing effects to the directly attached &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. The resulting hypervalent compounds have a dramatically narrow energy gap showing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission despite the limited size of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. In addition, the hypervalent compounds also exhibit stimuli&#8208;responsive chromism through the reversible coordination&#8208;number shift of the central main&#8208;group elements in both crystals and &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer films. We also explain that the nature of hypervalent bonds depends on the element type, which is particularly effective in bringing out the properties of heavy elements. In this review, we describe that the use of hypervalent bonds is a novel strategy not only for manipulating the energy levels of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system but also for developing a variety of functional materials based on the newly rising properties from hypervalent element.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A new family of stable radical&#8208;containing polytopic ligands based on tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amines TPMA architecture and their corresponding metal complexes have been synthesized. These molecular systems offered the possibility to investigate how various spin carriers, such as the metal ion and the organic radical, influence their EPR properties mainly through the empirical ratio of peak heights d1/d. Moreover, it has been possible to analyze how different conformations of TEMPO radical units in the molecular skeleton affect the metallic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Ratiometric Fluorescence Depending on In/Out Isomerism of Host&#8208;Guest Conjugate Having a Fluorosolvatochromic Dye</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Host&#8208;guest conjugate is a promising strategy for providing outstanding molecules. Herein, we designed host&#8208;guest conjugate HG1, which comprises a hydrophilic host unit, tetraaza[2.2.1.2.2.1]paracyclophane CPX2with a microhydrophobic cavity, and a guest unit, 2,3&#8208;naphthalimide fused with two benzothiophenes G1 exhibiting fluorosolvatochromism, linked with an oxyethylene chain. HG1 initially showed a fluorescence band at 585 nm in MeOH/H2O (1/499 v/v); however, this band decreased with time, and instead, a new band at 430 nm appeared. The CIE chromaticity diagram showed that the fluorescent color changed from yellow&#8208;orange to blue via white. NMR analysis of HG1 in methanol&#8208;d4 exhibited different signals of the G1 unit between the blue and yellow fluorescent structures. The blue fluorescent structures showed asymmetrical signals assigned as the G1 unit, affected by the cavity environment of the CPX2 unit. Consequently, HG1 can form two conformations: In&#8208;form and Out&#8208;form. In In&#8208;form, the G1 unit is inside the hydrophobic cavity of the CPX2 unit and shows blue fluorescence. In Out&#8208;form, the G1 unit is outside the CPX2 unit and shows yellow fluorescence in an aqueous solvent. Therefore, HG1 performs as a ratiometric fluorophore depending on the in/out isomerism of the host&#8208;guest conjugate.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Design and In&#8208;Flow Synthesis of Aromatic Endoperoxides Acting as Oxygen Releasing Agents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypoxia occurs in different pathological settings as a consequence of poor vascularization, and it results in reduced efficacy of some current nosocomial treatments i.e. chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy. In order to overcome these boundaries, aromatic endoperoxides (EPOs) have been studied and proposed as oxygen&#8208;releasing agents (ORAs) due to their ability to reversibly bind molecular oxygen (O2), liberating it upon suitable triggering. DFT calculation of the dissociation energy (Ediss) of the intramolecular O&#8208;O bridge and structural crystallographic data of synthesized and studied EPOs drove the design of an array of 9,10&#8208;disubstituted anthracenes among which three candidates were carefully selected. Once optimized the synthesis of the aromatic substrates, for the first time the corresponding EPOs have been produced under continuous flow irradiation in the presence of a sub&#8208;stoichiometric amount of a photosensitizer in organic solvents. The release of O2 could be obtained straightforwardly at 37.5 &#176;C by thermolysis. In accordance with the calculated Ediss = 3.2 kcal mol&#8208;1 and an experimental t1/2 = 40 minutes, 3,3'&#8208;(anthracene&#8208;9,10&#8208;diyl)bis(prop&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ol) resulted as the best candidate for the sustained release of O2 under physiologically relevant conditions. Its exploitation as ORA to relieve hypoxia will be evaluated and described in due course.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrocyanation of Non&#8208;Activated Alkenes Without Handling HCN</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review article, the works published in the last 20&#8197;years about the hydrocyanation of non&#8208;activated alkenes without using hydrogen cyanide gas have been compiled, paying special attention to all the different reaction mechanisms operating in each case.







Abstract
The hydrocyanation of alkenes can be considered a straightforward methodology that gives access to different functionalized organic chemistry entities. This is due to nitrile's high versatility, which can easily undergo further transformations. However, this process has traditionally employed hazardous hydrogen cyanide as the hydrocyanation agent. Therefore, in the last decades, different protocols have been developed to accomplish this key organic transformation without needing to handle HCN. In this review, we aim to gather the most recent works published in the last couple of decades regarding the hydrocyanation of non&#8208;activated olefins in the absence of gaseous hydrogen cyanide as nitrile source. In addition, special attention has been paid to the reaction mechanism working in each case.

         <title>Synthetic Strategies to Prepare Bioactive Lysine and Peptide Conjugates With Triazolium Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid phase synthesis of lysine and peptide conjugates of Safirinium derivatives allowed demonstration of the relevance of Safirinium&#8208;lysine conjugates and building blocks as inhibitors of porcine pancrease elastase.







Abstract
Peptides conjugated with organic molecules can be useful tools for the development of novel bioactive compounds. The lysine side&#8208;chain is an interesting functional group to act as a linker to connect small molecules in peptide conjugates. Herein we present the design and synthesis of four Safirinium derivatives, their facile conjugation to lysine in solid phase, and incorporation in peptides. The compounds differing in the functionalization of nitrogen N2 of the condensed triazolyl moiety are novel building blocks to design conjugates to perform structure&#8208;activity relationship studies of elastase inhibitors. Consequently, structural investigations of the lysine building blocks and of the corresponding peptide conjugates were performed. We present herein the potential of the Safirinium analogs to act as elastase inhibitors in assays performed on porcine pancreas elastase.

         <title>Organocatalysis for Enantioselective Decarboxylative Nucleophilic Addition Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organocatalytic decarboxylation is a straightforward and environmentally friendly strategy for synthesizing various new carbon scaffolds. This methodology, inspired by natural biosynthetic processes, has been established for the formal preparation of enols from carboxyl compounds under mild conditions. Remarkable advances in the field of organocatalysis have enabled the control of stereoselectivity in this strategy.







Abstract
The catalytic decarboxylation of malonic acid half oxy&#8208; and thioesters, &#946;&#8208;ketocarboxylic acids, and their related compounds is a straightforward, powerful, and atom&#8208;economical strategy for the in&#8208;situ formation of enolates, which are important and well&#8208;studied synthons for various functional materials and natural products. This strategy, inspired by the biosynthesis of polyketides and fatty acids, is an attractive method for synthesizing enols from carboxyl compounds with less reactive &#945;&#8208;hydrogen atoms under mild conditions. In addition, these reactions are environmentally friendly and are of great interest to chemists because the use of a stoichiometric amount of base can be avoided, and the only byproduct is CO2. Thus far, remarkable progress has been made, especially in the field of organocatalytic enantioselective decarboxylation reactions, allowing for the stereocontrolled formation of new C&#8722;H, C&#8722;C, C&#8722;heteroatom, and C&#8722;X bonds. This review provides a comprehensive overview of organocatalytic enantioselective decarboxylation reactions and highlights the significant progress made since 2020. In particular, it focuses on chiral catalyst systems and transition states as key parameters for decarboxylation reactions.

         <title>I Bind It That Way &#8211; Bioorthogonal Unmasking of Pro&#8208;Fluorescent Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioorthogonally driven fluorogenic tagging scheme based on a novel design strategy is presented herein. The concept involving a click&#8208;to&#8208;release tetrazine unit as the trigger chemically caging a pro&#8208;fluorescent quinone methide precursor may address the limitations of tetrazine&#8208;quenched red/NIR excitable fluorogenic probes.







Abstract
Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies for the bioorthogonally controlled generation of pro&#8208;fluorescent quinone&#8208;methides are presented here. The novel concept relies on a click&#8208;to&#8208;release tetrazine unit that chemically cages a pro&#8208;fluorescent quinone methide precursor. On a synthetically readily accessible model compound we demonstrate that IEDDA reaction of the tetrazine with a TCO leads to the liberation of a pro&#8208;fluorescent quinone methide, which is readily captured by nearby nucleophiles to form a fluorescent scaffold. Unlike in previous approaches to access bioorthogonally activatable fluorogenic probes, where the tetrazine unit acted as a quencher of fluorescence, the role of the tetrazine is redefined here. Such repurposed role of tetrazines is foreseen to address the limitations of tetrazine&#8208;quenched red/NIR excitable fluorogenic probes.

         <dc:description>The research of electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex&#160;has developed fast in the field of photochemistry. Herein, the green and efficient metal&#8208;free visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted synthesis of difluorochroman&#8208;4&#8208;ones has been achieved with 2&#8208;(allyloxy)arylaldehyde&#160;and bromodifluoroacetamide, which is driven by noncovalent interactions between 2&#8208;(allyloxy)arylaldehyde/N,N,N',N'&#8208;tetramethylethylene diamine &#160;(TMEDA) and&#160;bromodifluoroacetamide/TMEDA. By precisely optimizing the electron donor and reaction solvent, a wide range of&#160;structurally diverse difluorochroman&#8208;4&#8208;ones, including aryl amide, aliphatic amide and ester groups, were obtained in up to 76% yields. This strategy offers the benefits of simple operation, good yields, high atomic economy and broad applicability, providing an essential complement to traditional approaches for the preparation of chroman&#8208;4&#8208;one skeletons without any transition metals, photocatalysts or oxidants.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An effective method for the construction of a multi&#8208;functionalized pyridine motif of indolizine using the [4+2] annulation pathway involves tandem Knoevenagel&#8208;aldol cyclization as a critical step in the process. The production of an indolizine scaffold with a hydroxy at C6 position and an ethyl ester/aldehyde at the C7 position was successfully accomplished using this approach with an excellent yield, with the use of a reagent that contains active methylene and operates under mild conditions. This straightforward and simple protocol allows extensions of the core moiety in a quick and dependable manner.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>With an aim of obtaining a fundamental understanding of C&#8208;C bond conformation theory, the molecular structure of an ethane with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxybenzene&#8208;sulfonate)ethane, was elucidated.&#160; According to the general conformation rule for alkanes, which states that molecules adopt a stabilized structure to avoid steric repulsion, ethanes typically adopt anti&#8208;conformation.&#160; However, the title compound exhibited gauche&#8208;conformation, as revealed by a single crystal diffraction study.&#160; Theoretical studies also support this behavior.&#160; Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis suggests that the orbital interaction between the &#963;*CO orbital, attributable to the sulfonate groups, and the adjacent &#963;CH orbital stabilizes the gauche&#8208;conformation.&#160; The authors conclude that the sulfonate group acts as an anti&#8208;periplanar effect synthon, which is widely applicable in organic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot Synthesis of Thioamides via Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Thiocarbamoyl Fluorides and Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The methylthio group plays a significant role in antitumor bioactive molecules, candidate drugs and natural products. Deuteration modification of drugs, which could prolong the half&#8208;life, reduce toxicity, and enhance targeting, has become an important strategy in the development and discovery of innovative drugs. Combining the unique properties of the methylthio group with the deuteration effect, the rapid introduction of trideuteromethylthiol groups into small organic molecules is essential for advancing the research and development of deuterated drugs. With the rapid development of new trideuteromethylthiolation reagents, this review first outlines the indirect introduction of trideuteromethylthiol groups, and then discusses the direct nucleophilic, electrophilic and free radical trideuteromethylthiolation methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalisation of Chromane by Deprotonative Metallation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two sets of conditions have been rationally optimised for the deprotometallation of chromane at the 4&#8208; or 8&#8208;position. Subsequent electrophilic trapping gave access to variously functionalised derivatives.







Abstract
Despite the biological interest in chromane derivatives, few studies dedicated to the functionalisation of this heterocycle have been reported. Herein, our objective is to demonstrate the potential of alkali metal bases for the introduction of substituents at its positions 4 and 8, and to explain the observed reactivity based on quantum chemical calculations. Guided by these theoretical results, preliminary optimisation was carried out on 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran before applying the optimal conditions to chromane. Deprotolithiation at C8 was thus achieved using n&#8208;butyllithium in hexane at room temperature, while functionalisation at C4 was promoted by a 1:1 mixture of lithium 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide and potassium tert&#8208;butoxide in tetrahydrofuran at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C. Various electrophiles were used to intercept the lithiated intermediates, providing a convenient access to substituted chromane derivatives.

         <title>Synthesis of various dihydro&#8208;thiazole and selenazole heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We prepared numerous thiazole derivatives from push&#8208;pull alkenes such as nitroenamines, enaminoester, and enaminonitrils in a two&#8208;step reaction with thiocyanate ion. The first step was the formation of the thiocyanate&#8208;substituted push&#8208;pull alkene from an iodine&#8208;containing intermediary. We demonstrated this sequence through the preparation and identification of the iodine&#8208;substituted enamines. In the second step, thiazole ring closure took place in methanol, at room temperature. The imino group of the condensed thiazole ring systems was successfully acylated. The same reaction sequence with potassium selenocyanate resulted in two selenocyanate and a selenazole heterocyclic derivatives. The mechanism of the reaction with thiocyanate ion and the heterocycle formation was investigated by computational methods. We performed quantum chemical calculations, involving both the thermodynamic and the kinetic aspects of the ring closure reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyzing the Enantioselective Tail&#8208;to&#8208;Head Terpene Cyclization inside Optically Active Hexameric Resorcin[4]arene Capsules: A Surprising Odd&#8208;Even Effect of the Catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Terpenes, created in Nature via tail&#8208;to&#8208;head terpene (THT) cyclizations, have long fascinated chemists due to their complex structures and biological activities. Recreating such THT cyclizations in the laboratory using man&#8208;made catalysts has been challenging. Especially difficult is performing the reaction in an enantioselective fashion, as the substrate is flexible and does not contain much functionality to form strong interactions with the chiral catalyst. This study explores the enantioselective THT cyclization inside hexameric capsules self&#8208;assembled from optically active resorcin[4]arene derivatives. An unexpected odd&#8208;even effect, where the enantioselectivity of the reaction depended on the length of the alkyl chain attached to the resorcin[4]arene capsule was uncovered. To our knowledge, this is the first example of an odd&#8208;even effect in the catalyst itself, and also the first instance in which this effect is related to the enantioselectivity of the reaction.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this paper, we reported a facial approach for the preparation of benzo[c][1,2]oxazine scaffolds via visible light induced phenyl iodine bis(trifluoroacetate) (PIFA) oxidative [4+2] annulation of vinyl benzenes with N&#8208;aryl substituted hydroxamic acids. In the transformation, amidoxyl radicals are readily generated via covalent I&#8211;O bond formation and photo&#8208;induced I&#8211;O cleavage from N&#8208;aryl substituted hydroxamic acids, and their coupling with vinyl arenes in the form of [4+2] annulation delivers benzo[c]&#8208;[1,2]oxazines derivatives. This reaction proceeds in the absence of transition metals and catalysts, exhibits broad substrate scope of both alkenes and N&#8208;aryl substituted hydroxamic acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Tris(3&#8208;Pyrrolyl BODIPY) on 1, 3, 5&#8208;Triazine Scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY) on 1,3,5&#8208;triazine scaffold was synthesized over a sequence of steps starting from commercially available cyanuric chloride.&#160; The cyanuric chloride was reacted with p&#8208;hydroxy benzaldehyde to afford 1,3,5&#8208;triazine tris(p&#8208;oxybenzaldehyde) which was then reacted with excess pyrrole under acid catalyzed conditions to afford 1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;tris(meso&#8208;p&#8208;oxyphenyl dipyrromethane).&#160; Subsequent in situ oxidation of this compound with DDQ to obtain tris(meso&#8208;oxyphenyldipyrromethene) which was then treated with pyrrole followed by the addition of Et3N/BF3&#11825;OEt2 afforded fluorescent tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY). For comparison, tris(BODIPY) on the triazine scaffold was prepared by oxidizing tris(meso&#8208;oxyphenyldipyrromethane) with DDQ followed by complexation with BF3&#11825;OEt2. Both compounds were thoroughly characterized and studied by various experimental and theoretical methods.&#160; Absorption, steady state fluorescence, time&#8208;resolved fluorescence, and transient&#8208;absorption studies revealed that in tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY), excitonic interactions between two of the three 3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY units resulted in a hypsochromic shift in spectral bands, reducing the quantum yield and singlet state lifetime whereas tris(BODIPY) did not show such excitonic interactions. DFT studies helped in understanding the excitonic interactions in tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY). The tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY) was fluorescent both in solution and solid state. The viscosity studies indicated that the fluorescence of tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY) increases significantly with solvent viscosity, suggesting its potential for measuring cellular viscosity during physiological processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Ethynylene&#8208;Bridged Pentacene Trimer and Tetramer Prepared Through Unexpected Oligomerization and Their Subsequent Thermal Conversions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethynylene&#8208;bridged acenes, which are &#960;&#8208;conjugated triple bond&#8208;containing systems, have attracted increasing interest as promising organic semiconductor materials due to their delocalized&#160;&#960;&#8208;electrons. In this study, ethynylene&#8208;bridged pentacene precursor oligomers were not only synthesized through multiple&#8208;organic reactions but also were unexpectedly obtained in one&#8208;pot by using a conventional reaction with lithium silylacetylide and quinone. In the case of one&#8208;pot synthesis, the formation of oligomers, including pentamer, was evidently confirmed by matrix&#8208;assisted&#8208;laser&#8208;desorption/ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis visualized the ethynylene&#8208;bridged structure of the dimer which was one of the major products in the one&#8208;pot reaction. It was found that the reaction time for the lithiation was the key factor in controlling oligomer formation. Finally, the thermal conversion from pentacene precursors to the corresponding pentacene oligomers was achieved via retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. These results would open an access to synthesize a wide range of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Furano&#8208; and Thieno&#8208;fused Carbazole&#8208;Containing Azaborines and Their &#960;&#8208;Extension: Synthesis, Structures, and Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of carbazole&#8208;containing azaborines, furano&#8208;fused 1&#8208;2F and 1&#8208;3F and thieno&#8208;fused 1&#8208;2T and 1&#8208;3T, were efficiently synthesized from a common carbazole boronic acid ester in two steps. The structural effects of the fused ring moieties and the patterns of the ring fusion were clarified. According to X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis, the furano&#8208; and thieno&#8208;fused carbazole azaborines had planar structures and generally formed 1D columns. UV&#8211;vis analysis revealed that their absorption properties were significantly affected by the fused ring moieties. In contrast, the fluorescence properties were affected by the ring fusion patterns. &#960;&#8208;Extended derivatives of 1&#8208;2T and 1&#8208;3T, benzothiophene&#8208;fused 1&#8208;2BT and 1&#8208;3BT and phenyl&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;2T&#8208;Ph2 and 1&#8208;3T&#8208;Ph2 were synthesized, and the effects of &#960;&#8208;extension on physical properties were also investigated. All the &#960;&#8208;extended compounds showed red&#8208;shifts in absorption and fluorescence spectra compared with the pristine 1&#8208;2T and 1&#8208;3T. The color of solid&#8208;state emission of the synthesized azaborines was tuned from purple to green without electron&#8208;rich or &#8208;deficient substituents. The structural effects on the electronic structures were also discussed based on theoretical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Switching the Stereopreference of TeSADH: Enabling Anti&#8208;Prelog Asymmetric Reduction of Aryl&#8208;Ring&#8208;Containing Ketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The biocatalytic asymmetric reduction of prochiral ketones offers a promising approach for producing optically active secondary alcohols. Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) are enzymes that facilitate the reversible conversion of prochiral ketones into their corresponding optically active secondary alcohols, and thus are pivotal for this process. Most ADHs adhere to Prelog's rule in determining the stereopreference for the asymmetric reduction of prochiral ketones. This study focuses on the &#916;P84/A85G mutation of TeSADH, demonstrating its capability to reduce aryl&#8208;ring&#8208;containing ketones to their corresponding alcohols in anti&#8208;Prelog mode with high stereoselectivities. The study also highlights the crucial role of P84 in switching the stereopreference of TeSADH in the asymmetric reduction of aryl&#8208;ring&#8208;containing ketones. Furthermore, this mutant exhibits a broad substrate scope, including substrates accepted by the previously reported W110 mutants of TeSADH with opposite stereopreference. The ability to create mutants of the same enzyme with opposite stereopreferences presents intriguing opportunities for fascinating transformations, such as bienzymatic racemization, which can be utilized in dynamic kinetic resolution, and stereoinversion using two enantiocomplementary mutants of the same enzyme.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Boron&#8211;Imidazole Complexes and Studies on Their Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Fluorescence Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organoboron complexes represented by BODIPY are one of the candidates for fluorescent skeletons exhibiting good fluorescence properties in the solution. However, because most BODIPY have high planar skeletons and small Stokes shifts, their fluorescence is quenched in the solid state. Therefore, numerous approaches were challenged to prepare the solid state fluorescent BODIPYs. On the other hand, an alternative approach to developing solid state fluorophores involves imidazole&#8208;boron complexes. Herein, imidazole&#8208;based boron complexes featuring the imidazo[1,2&#8208;c][1,3,2]diazaborole skeleton were synthesized. This skeleton comprised two fused five&#8208;membered rings and could introduce substituent at the 2&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 5&#8208;, and 6&#8208;positions. The boron complexes with aryl groups at the 3,5,6&#8208;positions exhibited fluorescence in both the solution and solid states. These compounds exhibited Stokes shifts exceeding 120 nm, effectively suppressing self&#8208;absorption. DFT calculations suggested that the large Stokes shift could be attributed to the planarization of &#960;&#8208;conjugation upon excitation. In the solid state, the complexes displayed mechanofluorochromism, with the altered fluorescence color being recovered upon annealing at 150 &#176;C. Compounds with two or three methoxy groups underwent a phase transition to a glass state, resulting in long&#8208;wavelength fluorescence. Furthermore, they demonstrated mechanochromism, thermochromism, and thermofluorochromism in the solid state, indicating their potential as scaffolds for multifunctional fluorophores.</dc:description>

         <title>An Optically Active 4&#8208;Aryl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroisocoumarin&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A four step sequence for the preparation of optically active (R,R)&#8208;ethyl 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroisocoumarin&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylate is reported. In the first step the first stereocenter was installed by palladium catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition of PhB(OH)2 to indenone (88% ee). After deprotonation, the ester moiety was introduced with Mander's reagent. The &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of the resulting &#946;&#8208;oxoester was then achieved with cerium&#8208;catalysis under an air atmosphere. Key transformation was the cyanide&#8208;catalyzed ring transformation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoester furnishing the &#948;&#8208;lactone moiety of the target compound, which was formed as a mixture of separable cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;diastereoisomers, both with 88% ee. The cis&#8208;isomer could be epimerized to the trans&#8208;compound. The relative trans and the absolute (R,R)&#8208;configuration of the target compound was established by X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Experiment Meets Theory: Cope Rearrangements and Thermal E/Z Isomerisations of Terpenoid Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermal reactions including Cope rearrangements and E/Z isomerisations of three diterpenoids were investigated experimentally. In addition, DFT calculations were performed to explain the experimental findings of this study and of related systems from the literature. It is demonstrated that accurate computational data are only obtained, if ensembles of most stable conformers are considered.







Abstract
Several terpenes are known that can undergo a Cope rearrangement. Prominent examples include germacrene A and hedycaryol that show a Cope rearrangement already slightly above room temperature. In the present study the Cope rearrangements of several terpenes and eventually co&#8208;occurring thermal E/Z isomerisations were investigated experimentally for their minimum required temperatures and for their states of equilibrium. The experimental findings were supported by computational assessments of free activation energies (&#916;G&#8800;) as well as relative Gibbs free energies of the reactants (&#916;G).

         <title>Characterization and Optimization of the Photoluminescent Properties of Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In our previous work we could show, that Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines are compounds with interesting optical properties. In this work, we optimized the photoluminescent properties of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines by following outlined trends in our previous work. By introducing electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor residual groups on the imidazole ring, the quantum yield (QY) could be significantly increased. This indicated a clear advantageous substitution pattern for this system. In addition, cyclic voltammetric and UV/vis measurements in solid state lay the foundation for applications, such as organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).</dc:description>

         <title>Unleashing the Power of Domino Reactions on Carbohydrates: State of the Art</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intricate nature of carbohydrate structures has prompted the scientific community to seek efficient protocols for their manipulation. Lengthy synthetic pathways, often necessary to achieve complex sugar structures, pose challenges not only in terms of time and cost but also regarding environmental sustainability. Consequently, domino transformations serve as valuable tools in streamlining drug discovery processes. Sequential procedures involving fewer steps and minimal isolation/purification steps are particularly appealing to organic chemists in the field of carbohydrate chemistry. This review highlights several examples of domino transformations applied to carbohydrates, aiming to summarize their chemical potential in delivering sugar&#8208;based compounds with significant applications in the generation of new chemical scaffolds for drug discovery and chemical biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium Supported on Silk Fibroin as Efficient Catalyst for Sonogashira Coupling and Sonogashira&#8208;Cacchi Type Annulation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A palladium catalyst supported on silk fibroin (Pd/SF) has been tested in the Sonogashira coupling reactions of a wide range of aryl iodides and terminal alkynes. The best catalytic performance was obtained at 90 &#176;C using only 0.25 mol% metal loading under copper&#8208;free conditions, in the presence of a H2O/EtOH (3:2 v/v) solvent mixture and triethylamine as the base, affording the coupling products in good yields. The Pd/SF&#8208;based protocol was then successfully extended to the synthesis of benzofurans through Sonogashira&#8208;Cacchi type annulation of 2&#8208;iodophenol with terminal alkynes. Preliminary investigations on the recyclability and the heterogeneous behaviour of the catalyst were performed: hot filtration test and leaching test evidenced the presence of a small amount of soluble active palladium species into the reaction mixture. Nevertheless, Pd/SF could be reused in recharging test and it can be recycled in four consecutive runs with no significant deactivation.</dc:description>

         <title>Mild C&#8722;H Alkoxylation of Aromatic Amides Catalyzed by Salicylaldehyde&#8208;Co(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficiently C&#8722;H alkoxylation of aromatic amides with primary alchols promoted by salicylaldehyde&#8208;cobalt catalysis under mild condition is detaild in this study. This protocol tolerates broad substrate scope including natural products.







Abstract
A simple and efficient salicylaldehyde&#8208;promoted cobalt&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the C&#8722;H alkoxylation of aromatic amides by employing primary alcohols as the coupling partner has been developed. This method utilizes a 8&#8208;aminoquinoline moiety as the directing group and successfully achieves the ortho&#8722;C&#8722;H alkoxylation in moderate to good yields under mild conditions. This protocol features excellent functional tolerance and broad substrate scope including natural products. In addition, the directing group could be easily removed as well.

         <title>1,2&#8208;Diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes as a Multifaceted Synthon for the Synthesis of Heterocycles: A Fifteen&#8208;Years Update</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of structurally unique scaffolds entities with increased complexity and balanced physicochemical properties has the potential to allow synthetic chemists to exploit areas of chemical space that were previously inaccessible. Among the different strategies employed for generating N&#8208;heterocycles, cyclization and cycloaddition reactions represent a valuable synthetic tool. The purpose of this minireview is to summarize the recent advances (2009&#8208;present) from our laboratory on the generation of intriguing five&#8208;, six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered mono&#8208; or poly&#8208;heterocyclic architectures (linear, fused and spiro) employing 1,2&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes (DDs) as key synthons.</dc:description>

         <title>Trends in the Reactivity of Pentacyclic Ether Derivatives on Silicon and Germanium Surfaces Revealed by Energy Decomposition Analysis for Extended Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We analyze the adsorption and ring&#8208;opening reaction of pentacyclic chalcogen alkyls with chalcogen atoms ranging from oxygen to tellurium using computational analysis. Thus extends our previous investigation of THF on silicon towards germanium surface and towards the heavier chalcogen homologues. We found an increasing dative bond strength of the precursor state with the period of the chalcogen atom on both surfaces. Using energy decomposition analysis for extended systems (pEDA), differences in the trends between silicon and germanium were revealed. Following the dative bound state, subsequent ring&#8208;opening reactions were found to proceed via a nucleophilic back&#8208;side attack, similar to a molecular SN2 reaction. Reaction energies and barrier heights show a maximum for the sulfur derivative. This trend was found to correlate with the position of the transition state in the reaction and agrees with the molecular reactivity. The uniquely low barrier of THF can be attributed to its ring strain. Our findings shed light on the fundamental aspects of surface chemistry and the benefits of using quantitative bonding analysis in this field. It also paves the way for future explorations into the functionalization of semiconductor surfaces using higher&#8208;period ether derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Synthesis of Fluorescent 1,4&#8208;Benzothiazin&#8208;2&#8208;ones through Thiol&#8208;Free Iodine&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A convergent synthesis of 2H&#8208;benzo[b][1,4]thiazin&#8208;2&#8208;one was achieved via iodine&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction. This strategy involves the formation of two new C&#8211;S bonds and a C&#8211;N bond from the readily available precursors &#8208; aryl methyl ketones,&#160;p&#8208;anisidine, and elemental sulfur to generate the desired heterocycle in moderate to good yields. As the synthesized benzothiazine&#8208;2&#8208;ones are fluorescent under UV light, photophysical properties like solid&#8208;state emission, solvatochromism, Aggregation Induced Emission (AIE), and the relative quantum yields of the compounds were measured which proves them to be a potential candidate for the development of optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we have demonstrated a palladium&#8208;catalyzed &#947;&#8208;alkenylation of unactivated alkenes with vinylcyclopropanes. A bidentate 8&#8208;aminoquinoline directing group was utilized for the regioselective &#947;&#8722;C(alkenyl)&#8722;H functionalization of unactivated alkenes with vinylcyclopropanes. This protocol exhibits wide substrate scope and good selectivity. Additionally, substrate diversification was performed to demonstrate the synthetic utility of the protocol. Mechanistic investigations were carried out to provide an insight to the reaction mechanism. A plausible mechanism was also proposed for the present methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>SYNTHESIS AND REACTIVITY OF CARBOHYDRATES CONTAINING 3&#8208;MEMBERED HETEROCYCLES, KEY PRECURSORS OF MODIFIED SUGARS AND MIMETICS</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecules containing three&#8208;membered heterocycles, including oxiranes (epoxides), thiiranes (episulfides) and aziridines, are considered privileged structures as they serve as key precursors or intermediates for the synthesis of a varied range of organic compounds, such as natural products, mimetics and pharmaceuticals. The principal advantage of this type of heterocycles is their reactivity towards the nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening, which usually occurs in a regioselective manner, resulting in the formation of 1,2&#8208;disubstituted products. When attached to a chiral scaffold, such as a carbohydrate molecule, the ring&#8208;opening process is usually highly diastereoselective. Therefore, these compounds have been extensively employed in the field of carbohydrates for the synthesis of enantiomerically pure modified sugars that are useful as glycobiology tools. This review presents an overview of the recent methodologies developed for the construction of epoxide, thiirane, and aziridine rings from common or modified sugars. Due to their structural similarity to carbohydrates, three&#8208;membered heterocyclic derivatives of cyclitols and carbasugars have been included. All these compounds, and their ring&#8208;opening derivatives have shown to be crucial in the synthesis of glycomimetics, which display diverse biological activities. These include enzyme inhibition, binding to lectin receptors, and more recently, the use as probes for the diagnosis and monitoring of diseases.</dc:description>

The results obtained have been compared with those obtained for the non&#8208;coordinated corannulene counterpart. It has been observed that the presence of the ruthenium moiety favors, both kinetically and thermodynamically, the [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction with cyclopentadiene. The factors governing these differences depend on the nature of the [Ru] complex. Whereas the interaction energy is solely responsible for the lower activation energy for the monocationic system (CpRu+), not only the higher interaction but also the lower strain energy explain the much higher reactivity observed for the dicationic systems ((C6H6)Ru2+ and (CpRu)22+). In this latter case, the Pauli repulsion energy term is the factor controlling the differences in the interaction energies, following the so&#8208;called Pauli repulsion&#8208;lowering concept. Finally, when &#951;6&#8208;coordinating mono&#8208; or dicationic ruthenium complexes, although&#160;although the [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction in the external rim bonds remains thermodynamically and kinetically more favourable, the cycloaddition becomes also thermodynamically feasible in some internal bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Lactones via Electrochemical Sequential Oxidative Process</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical lactone synthesis methodology has been developed, providing a rapid access to various dibenzopyranones from 2&#8208;arylbenzaldehyde, besides, 2&#8208;arylbenzoic acid could also be transformed into corresponding dibenzopyranones in high efficiency. Various control experiments have been conducted to verify the mechanism of this electrochemical tandem oxidation.







Abstract
Herein, we unveil a novel electrochemical oxidative strategy that facilitates the synthesis of lactones from 2&#8208;arylbenzaldehydes and 2&#8208;arylbenzoic acids. Crucially, our method allows for the convergent synthesis of lactones from the combinations of the respective 2&#8208;arylbenzaldehyde and 2&#8208;arylbenzoic acid as starting material, owing to the oxidative process's compatibility within our electrochemical setup. This approach offers a robust and versatile pathway to construct various dibenzopyranones type lactone compounds through an environmentally considerate and economically advantageous process.

         <title>Iron(&#921;&#921;&#921;) Catalyzed Aerobic C&#945;&#8722;C&#946; Cleavage of Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct C&#945;&#8722;C&#946; cleavage of allylic alcohols under mild aerobic conditions is presented. The method constitutes a special case of the Mukaiyama hydration reaction, where the presence of a free hydroxyl group in the nearby carbon alters the fate of the reaction leading to the oxidative braking of C&#945;&#8722;C&#946; bond. A broad selection of allylic alcohols has been examined and found to deliver useful for further functionalization products in good to excellent yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies allowed us to propose a plausible pathway that may lead to the fragmentation products.







Abstract
The regiospecific C&#945;&#8722;C&#946; cleavage of allylic alcohols under modified aerobic Mukaiyama hydration conditions is presented. The new methodology can be regarded as an equivalent of a two&#8208;step process, a typical hydration of the parent allylic alcohol followed by a 1,2&#8208;diol cleavage. A broad scope of substrates, both cyclic and acyclic, are applicable, thus introducing substantial structural modification to the core, especially of the former type of substrates. Mechanistic investigation of the reaction reveals the importance of the nearby hydroxyl group for the deviation from the typical Mukaiyama hydration pathway.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research presents a novel method for synthesizing azepino[5,4,3&#8208;cd]indole structures through the reactions of N&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles with Michael acceptors compounds at the indole 4&#8208;site, followed by intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition.

Abstract
The present study provided an efficient synthesis pathway to the azepino[5,4,3&#8208;cd]indoles using N&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles and 4&#8208;vinylindoles through a cascade carbene insertion and intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition. This method is distinguished by mild reaction conditions, straightforward operational steps, accessible starting materials and broad substrate compatibility. Furthermore, the versatility of this reaction with various Michael acceptors significantly broadens the scope of potential substrates. The ability to further transform the resulting multifunctional products underscores the promising applications of this approach in indole nitrogen heterocyclic synthesis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the research collaboration between Indian and German scientists has flourished, underscored by a deep commitment to fostering collaboration in science across various domains between the two countries. Held since 2006, the Indo-German Chemistry Workshops have been a testament to this collaborative spirit. These workshops, organized by various hosts, have alternated between locations in India and Germany. The purpose of these workshops is to bring together scientists from different disciplines of chemical sciences and chemical engineering, and work on diverse emerging topics to form new alliances and joint publications, while preparing ground for new projects. They have been instrumental in breaking down disciplinary barriers and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations having the potential for groundbreaking innovations. This Guest Editorial introduces Indo-German Workshop series and their high-quality research output showcased as &#8220;Research consortia &amp;amp; Institute Features: Indo-German Workshops (2011&#8211;2022)&#8221; &#8211; a joint special collection from the European Journal of Organic Chemistry (EurJOC), Chemistry-A European Journal (CEJ) and Chemistry-An Asian Journal (CAJ). This collection highlights important contributions to various domains of chemistry through research articles and reviews authored by faculty members from different institutes in India and Germany, who were past participants of these Indo-German workshops.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Alkynylation of Carbazoles with Alkynyl Bromides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct alkynylation of carbazoles, without the need for oxidants or sensitive reagents, has been developed. The broad substrate compatibility, scalability, and mechanistic insights underscore the method's significance for pharmaceutical and materials science applications.







Abstract
Carbazole derivatives are vital in medicinal and materials chemistry, yet accessing diverse substitutions remains challenging. Here, we introduce a regioselective approach for C1 and C8 alkynylation of carbazoles via palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation. This method provides a direct route to mono&#8208; and di&#8208;alkynylated derivatives, addressing the scarcity of alkynylated carbazole&#8208;based materials. Our study broadens the synthetic toolbox for carbazole functionalization, offering potential applications in optoelectronics, bio&#8208;imaging, and beyond, while contributing to developing sustainable C&#8722;H activation methodologies.

         <dc:description>In this study, we use computations and experiments to explore mechanistic scenarios that govern the reaction between secondary amines and trifluoropropenyl iodonium triflate with the aim of rationalizing and predicting experimental outcomes. Based on the results from theory, we have compiled a list of guidelines relevant to synthetic strategies and provide examples for the interpretation of selectivities. To demonstrate the viability of these strategies, we have performed directed experiments applying different reaction conditions to obtain the products predicted by our model.

         <title>Organocatalytic Activation of Unsymmetrical 2,3&#8208;Diketones Towards Catalytic Asymmetric Domino Michael&#8211;Henry Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalyst with unique properties &#8211; 2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)pyrrolidine &#8211; activates unsymmetrical diketones by forming an enamine from only one side, while enolization does not constitute a significant competing mechanism.







Abstract
In this study, we explored a method to distinguish between both enolizable regions of unsymmetrical 2,3&#8208;diketones in organocatalytic domino reactions involving nitroalkenes. The selective formation of an enamine from only one side of the molecule was made possible by the use of optically pure 2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)pyrrolidine. This catalyst, remarkably enhancing the reaction, owes its efficacy to a unique interplay between basicity and nucleophilicity. These features caused the enolization of the substrate at the second possible site to be omitted. The approach resulted in excellent regio&#8208; diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity (91&#8211;99&#8201;% ee) across various nitroalkenes, leading to the synthesis of novel cyclopentanone derivatives with three contiguous stereogenic center.

         <title>Unraveling the Potential of Cyclic N&#8208;Sulfonyl Ketimines in the MCR Universe</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We utilized cyclic N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines, a privileged class of heterocycles with extensive applications in organic and medicinal chemistry, in four distinct IMCRs, aiming to generate compound libraries compatible for structural elaboration. Four scaffolds, 15 novel compounds with high diversity and complexity, along with single crystal structures for each scaffold have been obtained, revealing their potential relevance in drug discovery.







Abstract
Cyclic N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines constitute an accessible class of lead&#8208;like heterocycles with a vast application in both synthetic organic and medicinal chemistry. In this context, we harness the capabilities of these heterocycles in four different isocyanide&#8208;based multicomponent reactions. Our goal was to create libraries of compounds with functional groups and vectors that are compatible for structural elaboration and optimization of their physical properties. We synthesized 15 unprecedented compounds with high diversity and complexity, whereas we have obtained four single crystal structures of each scaffold, unraveling their geometrical features and potential employment in drug discovery.

         <title>HFIP&#8208;Promoted Short Total Synthesis of Gochnatiolide D and Ainsliadimer A from Dehydrozaluzanin C</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It's just a matter of solvent! The special properties of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) can induce a one&#8208;pot dimerization&#8208;hydrolysis&#8208;aldol sequence in dehydrozaluzanin C for the total synthesis of ainsliadimer A and gochnatiolide D.







Abstract
The total syntheses of gochnatiolide D and ainsliadimer A were achieved through a streamlined one&#8208;pot sequence starting from their biogenetic precursor dehydrozaluzanin C. These biomimetic, protecting group&#8208;free syntheses involve the elegant orchestration of the highly diastereoselective hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of dehydrozaluzanin C, its subsequent hydrolysis to gochnatiolide D and finally an aldol reaction to ainsliadimer A, all harnessed by the hydrogen bond propensity and acidity of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), which was utilized as the reaction solvent.

         <title>Synthesis of Deoxy Pyranosides Via Fe(III) Catalyzed Regioselective Thiocarbonylation of Partially Protected Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step procedure for the synthesis of deoxysugars via site&#8208;selective thiocarbonylation followed by tin&#8208;free Barton&#8211;McCombie deoxygenation was disclosed. The selective thiocarbonylation could be smoothly achieved through FeCl3 assisted by benzoyltrifluoroacetonate (Hbtfa) in the presence of K2CO3. Further reduction can be carried out using greener silicon reagent, avoiding highly toxic organotin reagents.







Abstract
Rapid and efficient synthesis of targeted deoxygenated glycosides is highly desired. Herein, we disclose a two&#8208;step procedure for the synthesis of deoxysugars from partially protected pyranosides via site&#8208;selective thiocarbonylation followed by tin&#8208;free Barton&#8211;McCombie deoxygenation. The selectivity can be smoothly achieved through anhydrous FeCl3 as the catalyst assisted by low&#8208;priced benzoyltrifluoroacetonate (Hbtfa) ligand in the presence of K2CO3 as base. Further deoxygenation can be carried out using greener silicon reagent, avoiding highly toxic organotin reagents in traditional procedures. Conspicuous features of this method include mild conditions, easy operation, high selectivity and non or low toxic reagents, making it a more attractive strategy.

The selective thiocarbonylation could be smoothly achieved through FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; assisted by benzoyltrifluoroacetonate (Hbtfa) in the presence of K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid and efficient synthesis of targeted deoxygenated glycosides is highly desired. Herein, we disclose a two-step procedure for the synthesis of deoxysugars from partially protected pyranosides via site-selective thiocarbonylation followed by tin-free Barton&#8211;McCombie deoxygenation. The selectivity can be smoothly achieved through anhydrous FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as the catalyst assisted by low-priced benzoyltrifluoroacetonate (Hbtfa) ligand in the presence of K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as base. Further deoxygenation can be carried out using greener silicon reagent, avoiding highly toxic organotin reagents in traditional procedures. Conspicuous features of this method include mild conditions, easy operation, high selectivity and non or low toxic reagents, making it a more attractive strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Trifluoromethylsulfinyl Compounds: Recent Synthetic Approaches and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of trifluoromethylsulfinyl group into the required target molecules has become an indispensable strategy for pharmaceutical chemists to improve the success of new drug discovery. The review systematically summarizes recent synthetic approaches and future perspectives of trifluoromethylsulfinyl compounds based on the indirect and direct methods.







Abstract
The introduction of trifluoromethylsulfinyl group into the required target molecules has become an indispensable strategy for pharmaceutical chemists to improve the success of new drug discovery. Compared with the indirect methods, direct trifluoromethylsulfinylation by employing available trifluoromethylsulfinylating reagents is an important and elegant strategy for the rapid assembly of valuable CF3S(O)&#8208;derived organic molecules. This review focuses on the recent synthetic approaches and future perspectives of trifluoromethylsulfinyl compounds based on the indirect and direct methods in this area. These transformations proceed effectively with high yields and good functional group compatibility under mild conditions.

Herein, we report a mild Lewis acid&#8208;promoted regiospecific and reaction course&#8208;dependent transformation of 4&#8208;azido&#8208;coumarins/4&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;quinolones/4&#8208;azido&#8208;thiocoumarin into structurally diversified C3&#8208;C4 fused imidazoles via single step and 5&#8208;substituted&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzodiazepines via two steps with 1,2&#8208;azide&#8208;nitrogen migration, through the transitory intermediacy of 2,3&#8208;bridged&#8208;2H&#8208;azirine and cyclic indium complex.







Abstract
Herein, we report an efficient route for coumarin C3&#8208;C4 fused imidazole scaffolds via indium chloride&#8208;mediated single&#8208;step transformation of 4&#8208;azido&#8208;coumarin with amines/aldehydes and coumarin C3&#8208;C4 fused 5&#8208;substituted&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzodiazepine scaffolds with 1,2&#8208;azide&#8208;nitrogen migration through two&#8208;step sequential synthesis via the transitory intermediacy of 2,3&#8208;bridged&#8208;2H&#8208;azirine. A plausible mechanistic pathway has been proposed from the control/entrapment experiments and 1H&#8208;NMR studies. This protocol provides the reaction condition&#8208;dependent product selectivity, structural diversification, and excellent yields.

         <title>Understanding the Role of Internal Lewis Acids in the Catalytic Activity of Urea&#8208;Based Hydrogen Donors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detailed quantum&#8208;chemical calculations were carried out to quantitatively rationalize the poorly understood factors leading to the enhanced catalytic activity of ureas having a Lewis acid in their structure in the nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening reaction of nitrocyclopropanes.







Abstract
Detailed quantum&#8208;chemical calculations have been carried out to understand both the origin of the catalysis in the urea&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening of nitrocyclopropanes and the acceleration induced by the presence of an internal Lewis acid in the catalyst. To this end, the mode of activation of these ureas is quantitatively analyzed in detail by means of the Activation Strain Model of reactivity in combination with the Energy Decomposition Analysis method. It is found that the presence of the Lewis acid in the urea further enhances the interaction between the reactants, by increasing both the electrostatic and orbital attractions, which translates into a reduced activation barrier. This insight is also used to assess the impact of the nature of the Lewis acid on the transformation, facilitating the rational design of more active catalysts.

         <title>Fabrication of a Highly Efficient and Reusable Pd/Al2O3/Al Monolithic Catalyst for the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and reusable Pd/Al2O3/Al monolithic catalyst is designed for the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction. The turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) of the Pd/Al2O3/Al monolithic catalyst reach 73,880 and 0.86&#8197;s&#8722;1, respectively. The catalyst can be easily separated from the reaction mixture using tweezers without any loss of catalytic activity over 14 cycles.







Abstract
Anodization was employed to treat the aluminum foil surface, leading to in&#8197;situ the generation of Al2O3, consequently amplifying the specific surface area to aid in the dispersal of palladium nanoparticles. Through the anodic oxidation of aluminum followed by a precipitation&#8208;deposition and calcination process, a highly efficient and reusable Pd/Al2O3/Al monolithic catalyst was synthesized. The effectiveness and reusability of the Pd/Al2O3/Al monolithic catalyst were evaluated in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction. The turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) of the Pd/Al2O3/Al monolithic catalyst reached 73,880 and 0.86&#8197;s&#8722;1, respectively. Furthermore, the catalyst could be recovered and reused in reactions regardless of the used substrates.

         <dc:description>
A highly effective method utilizing KOtBu is reported for the regioselective production of pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]quinolin&#8208;1&#8208;one and naphthyridin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;one derivatives from o&#8208;alkynylquinolinecarbonitriles.







Abstract
A KOtBu&#8208;promoted robust strategy has been described for the regioselective synthesis of pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]quinolin&#8208;1&#8208;one and naphthyridin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;one derivatives from o&#8208;alkynylquinolinecarbonitriles in good to excellent yields. The reaction proceeds through in&#8197;situ transformation of the nitrile moiety into an amide group followed by the selective C&#8722;N bond formation through a 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig or 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig annulation reaction. Among the synthesized derivatives, 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig naphthyridin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones displayed good photophysical properties. The present approach is superior to other established methodologies as it avoids use of transition metals and column chromatographic purification and affords the products in high yields. Additionally, the current methodology provides several additional advantages, such as one&#8208;pot operation, high atom economy, broad substrate scope and a step&#8208;economical process.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Heterobiaryl N&#8208;Cbz&#8208;Protected Diamines via Organocatalytic Arylation of 5&#8208;Aminoisoxazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axially chiral arylisoxazoles with high yields (up to 96&#8201;%) and excellent enantiomeric purities (up to 97&#8201;% ee) were synthesized through organocatalytic arylation of isoxazoles with N&#8208;Cbz&#8208;protected azonaphthalenes. Cbz protecting group can be readily removed, resulting in axially chiral heterobiaryl amines bearing free amine maintaining enantiomeric purity.







Abstract
An enantioselective arylation of isoxazoles with N&#8208;Cbz&#8208;protected azonaphthalenes is disclosed, affording a range of axially chiral arylisoxazoles in good yields and excellent enantiocontrol by utilizing chiral phosphoric acid. Cbz protecting group can be readily removed, resulting in five&#8208;six membered axially chiral heterobiaryl amines bearing free amine maintaining enantiomeric purity.

         <title>Fluorinated Chiral Pyrans Obtained via Mechanochemical Organocatalytic Michael/oxa&#8208;Michael Cascade</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical organocatalytic Michael/oxa&#8208;Michael cascade with fluorine containing unsaturated oxoesters and enones afford chiral fluorinated pyranes. Liquid&#8208;assisted grinding provide products in high yields and short reactions times. Diastereodivergency can be achieved by using either bifunctional thiourea or quinine organocatalyst.







Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;containing compounds are important in medicine or crop&#8208;protection. Herein, we show asymmetric organocatalytic Michael/oxa&#8208;Michael cascade leading to chiral fluorinated pyrans under mechanochemical conditions. Formal oxa&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between fluorine containing unsaturated keto esters and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones afforded a range of drug&#8208;like pyran derivatives in short times and good to high yields. Ball&#8208;milling conveys the reaction in short times and high product yields, while keeping high enantiomeric purities of products. The reaction is diastereodivergent depending on the use of either monofunctional amine catalysts or bifunctional thiourea or squaramide.

         <title>Linear &#960;&#8208;Extension of Acridone by the Fusion of Cyclobutadienoid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct functionalization of acridone via catalyzed arene&#8208;(oxa)norbornene annulation and subsequent aromatization leads to the formation of its linear conjugation&#8208;extended derivatives containing cyclobutadienoid. The presence of four&#8208;membered ring has no influences on the electronic structure of pyridone unit and molecular stability in comparison to those of acridone.







Abstract
The functionalization of small aromatic heterocycles is a straight and efficient method to access large polycyclic conjugated molecules. However, due to its unique reactivity, the derivatization of acridone usually gives the product in the angular shape and is difficult to obtain the linear ones. Here we report the direct functionalization of acridone to generate its linearly fused derivatives containing cyclobutadienoid via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed arene&#8208;(oxa)norbornene annulation followed by the dehydrated aromatization. The experimental characterizations demonstrate that the antiaromatic cyclobutadienoid ring can extend the molecular conjugation. Theoretical calculations reveal the weakened aromaticity of neighboring benzenoid rings of cyclobutadienoid with no influence on the electronic structure of central pyridone. The molecular stability is enhanced in comparison to that of linear acridone derivatives containing only six&#8208;membered rings.

         <title>Directed Arylation of 7&#8208;Oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane to Prepare 3D Fragments</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes Pd&#8208;catalysed &#946;&#8208;(hetero)arylation of the 7&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane framework via use of the 8&#8208;aminoquinoline directing group. Arylated products were formed in up to 99&#8201;% yield, and heteroarylated products in up to 88&#8201;% yield with complete diastereoselectivity. Cleavage of the directing group provided the corresponding primary amides, which may be of value in drug discovery as &#8216;3D&#8217; fragments.







Abstract
Directed Pd&#8208;catalysed &#946;&#8208;(hetero)arylation of the 7&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane framework is described. Arylated products were formed in up to 99&#8201;% yield, and heteroarylated products in up to 88&#8201;% yield with complete diastereoselectivity. Different minor diarylated side products were formed, depending on whether electron deficient aryl or pyridyl iodides were used as the coupling partners. Cleavage of the 8&#8208;aminoquinoline directing group provided small bridged compounds that may be of value in fragment based drug discovery.

Thiochromen&#8208;4&#8208;ones were synthesized by the denitrative formal [5+1] cycloaddition of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ones with thioacetamide without the need for transition&#8208;metal catalysis or the exclusion of air or moisture. The reaction is thought to exploit the propensity of thioacetamide to undergo hydrolysis under basic conditions. A nucleophilic aromatic substitution and denitrative rearomatization cascade gave the S&#8208;heterocyclic products in yields of 41&#8211;99&#8201;%.







Abstract
A new strategy for thiochromen&#8208;4&#8208;one synthesis that relies on the denitrative formal [5+1] cycloaddition of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ones with thioacetamide is described. Achieved under reaction conditions that did not require transition metal catalysis, nor the exclusion of air or moisture, the reaction is suggested to involve exploiting the propensity of thioacetamide to undergo hydrolysis under basic conditions. This is follows by addition of the ensuing sulfide anion to the 1,3&#8208;alkynone and a nucleophilic aromatic substitution and denitrative rearomatization cascade to give the S&#8208;heterocyclic product in yields of 41&#8211;99&#8201;%.

6&#8208;Aroyl benzimidazo[1,2&#8208;c]quinazolines were obtained from N&#8208;cyanobenzimidazoles and &#945;&#8208;keto acids using persulfate salt as oxidant via visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced radical relay. Mechanism study suggests involvement of photoredox and energy transfer pathways.







Abstract
A diverse array of 6&#8208;aroyl benzimidazo[1,2&#8208;c]quinazolines was successfully synthesized using easily obtainable N&#8208;cyanobenzimidazoles and &#945;&#8208;keto acids, facilitated by photoredox catalysis. A mechanistic investigation revealed that this methodology might involve both photoredox and energy transfer catalytic cycles, generating acyl radicals that subsequently promote radical relay cyclization.

An array of 1&#8208;aryloxy&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;aminopropan&#8208;2&#8208;ols were synthesized using iodohydroxylation of gem&#8208;difluorinated allyl aryl ethers followed by epoxidation and ring&#8208;opening with an amine in a one&#8208;pot/two&#8208;step fashion. This approach allows the synthesis of a set of gem&#8208;difluorinated derivatives of commercialized beta&#8208;blockers.

         <title>Synthesis and Ring&#8208;Closing Reactions of Aminocyclohexane Derivatives Bearing Unsaturated Side Chains at C2: Stereocontrolled Approaches to cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;Fused Perhydro&#8208;indoles and &#8208;quinolines</title>

         <dc:description>
Two epimeric pairs of N&#8208;protected cyclohexamines bearing acrylate residues attached at C2 have been investigated for their capacities to undergo base&#8208;promoted intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition reactions. Three of these substrates do so both efficiently and completely diastereoselectively. Simple manipulation of the product perhydroindoles and decahydroquinolines afford ready access to novel analogues of the potent neurotoxin pumiliotoxin C.







Abstract
Two epimeric pairs of N&#8208;Ts&#8208;protected cyclohexylamines that incorporate an unsaturated side&#8208;chain at the C2 position have been prepared. Contrary to expectations, none of these underwent clean, photochemically&#8208;induced intramolecular hydroamination reactions to give the corresponding perhydro&#8208;indole or &#8208;quinoline. However, they did participate in efficient olefin cross metathesis (OCM) reactions with methyl crotonate. Three of the four acrylates so&#8208;formed engaged in base&#8208;promoted and completely diastereoselective, intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition (cyclization) reactions to give the isomeric and C2&#8208;substituted perhydro&#8208;indoles or &#8208;quinolines with the structures of these being confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analyses. DFT calculations generated results consistent with the observed diastereoselectivities and the proposed transition states. Manipulation of the ester groups associated with the cyclization products allowed for their conversion, inter alia, into the corresponding n&#8208;propyl residues and thus providing novel analogues of neurotoxic alkaloids such as pumiliotoxin C.

         <title>Halogenation of Alkenes Using Three&#8208;Component Reactions: A Decade of Development</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkenes are valuable feedstocks in organic synthesis. One effective method for synthesizing organic halides with functional groups in close proximity is the direct difunctionalization of alkenes via three&#8208;component reactions. In this review, we mainly discuss decade developments (2013&#8211;2023) in two categories: (1) halogenation via three&#8208;membered ring intermediates, involving haliranium, thiiranium,seleniranium, aziridinium and epoxide species; (2) halogenation via a radical pathway.







Abstract
Alkenes are valuable feedstocks in organic synthesis. One effective method for synthesizing organic halides with functional groups in close proximity involves the direct difunctionalization of alkenes via three&#8208;component reactions. This approach not only reduces the number of steps involved in the synthesis process, but also minimizes waste generation and enables the formation of complex molecules from simple starting materials. In this review, we mainly discuss decade developments (2013&#8208;2023) in two categories: (1) halogenation via three&#8208;membered ring intermediates, involving haliranium, thiiranium,seleniranium, aziridinium and epoxide species; (2) halogenation via a radical pathway. Reactions with I2, BiI3, NaI, Bu4N+[I(O2CAr)2]&#8722;, NIS, NBS, NCS, DBH, BsNMeBr, HBr, HCl, KI, NH4I, I2O5, Et3N&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3HF, Selectfluor, CuI, CuBr, CuCl, LiCl, KBr, NaCl, SOCl2, Py&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;9HF, NFSI, TBSCl et&#8197;al have been recorded and how the added reagents work will be discussed. We hope this review will do help for future research in this area.
