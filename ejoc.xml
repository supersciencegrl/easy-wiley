         <title>Functionalization of Sydnones with Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes, Cyclobutanes, and Michael Acceptors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an easy one&#8208;fits&#8208;all, transition metal&#8208;free protocol for a Friedel&#8208;Crafts type functionalization of sydnones with donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes, cyclobutanes, and Michael acceptors. Yields range from moderate to excellent and are indifferent to scale&#8208;up. The products can be of use to the emerging field of bio&#8208;orthogonal sydnone chemistry.







Abstract
We present a Lewis acid catalyzed nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes and &#8208;butanes by sydnones, utilizing their respective 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;reactivity. The same conditions can be applied for the addition of sydnones to Michael acceptors. We propose a Friedel&#8208;Crafts like mechanism. The reaction provides a rare, low&#8208;temperature, transition metal&#8208;free, and functional group tolerant protocol for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of these mesoionic compounds of emerging importance in catalysis and bio&#8208;orthogonal chemistry.

         <title>Biomimetic Syntheses of Amorfrutin C and C&#8208;5 Substituted Amorfrutin Analogues</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorfrutin C, a C&#8208;5 prenyl substituted amorfrutin, its allyl analog and an amorfrutin C&#8208;5 aldehyde derivate have been synthesized from a common amorfrutin intermediate, which was prepared via a biomimetic &#946;, &#948;&#8208;diketo&#8208;dioxinone aromatization reaction.







Abstract
Amorfrutin C, a C&#8208;5 prenyl amorfrutin, its allyl analog and an amorfrutin C&#8208;5 aldehyde have been synthesized using a biomimetic strategy from non&#8208;aromatic precursors. In this approach, a dioxinone derived &#946;,&#948;&#8208;diketo ester underwent a decarboxylative Pd(0) catalyzed prenyl migration to give a &#946;,&#948;&#8208;diketo dioxinone, which readily aromatized giving the amorfrutin core. The introduction of prenyl and allyl moieties at the C&#8208;5 position of the scaffold was accomplished using a Claisen rearrangement. Alternatively, iodination, lithium&#8208;iodine exchange and trapping with DMF gave the amorfrutin aldehyde and an amorfrutin alcohol when excess n&#8208;BuLi was used.

         <title>The role of chain length in cucurbit[8]uril complexation of methyl alkyl viologens</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Viologens are among the most studied guests for cucurbit[8]uril (  CB[8]  ) and their complexation is usually driven by bipyridyl core inclusion inside the cavity to maximize both hydrophobic and cation&#8208;dipole interactions. The presence of alkyl substituents on the guest alters this complexation mode, switching to aliphatic chain inclusion in U&#8208;folded conformation. Here we report a thorough study of the influence of the alkyl chain length on the binding mode of methyl alkyl viologens. The chain length of the studied guests was increased by two methylene groups starting from methyl dodecyl viologen (  MVC12  ) to the octadecyl analogue (  MVC18  ). Complexation in water, investigated by NMR spectroscopy and ITC, revealed a clear switch from 1:1 to 2:1 stoichiometry moving from 12 to 16 carbon atoms, as a consequence of the chain folding of the major portion of the longer alkyl chain in one  CB[8]  cavity and the inclusion of the full viologen unit by another host molecule. The  CB[8]  2  &#8226;MVC18  complex crystal structure evidences the unprecedented 2:1 stoichiometry and quantified in 12 the number of carbon atoms necessary to fill the CB[8] cavity in U&#8208;shaped conformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Organocatalytic Construction of Spiro Oxindole Pyrrolidines Using Unsaturated &#945;&#8208;Ketoesters and &#945;&#8208;Ketoamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have investigated the stereoselective formation of spiro oxindole pyrrolidines via formal [3+2] cycloaddition of oxindole imines with ketoesters and ketoamides. Bifunctional squaramide organocatalyst was able to induce enantioselectivity of up to 60% ee, increased to 72% ee after re&#8208;crystallization, in the formation of spiro pyrrolidines with ketoesters. Interestingly, in addition to the main product ketoamides also provided alternative spiro oxindole pyrrole products via a different reaction pathway. Structures of spiro oxindole pyrrolidine as well as pyrrole products were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Two new squaramide based catalysts were synthesized and tested. DFT calculation helped elucidate reaction course.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Synthesis of Dibenzazepines and Dibenzazocines by 7&#8208;Exo&#8208; and 8&#8208;Endo&#8208;Dig&#8208;Selective Cycloisomerization</title>

The reaction of terminal alkynes gave dibenzo[  b  ,  d  ]azepines by 7&#8208;  exo  &#8208;  dig  cycloisomerization. In contrast, when internal alkynes were subjected to the reaction, 8&#8208;  endo  &#8208;  dig  cycloisomerization proceeded to provide dibenzo[  b  ,  d  ]azocines. The nucleophilicity at the reaction site and the electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of a tosyl group were important for the present selective transformation. This protocol could be used for ynamide substrates and a silver&#8208;catalyzed reaction gave 7&#8208;  exo  &#8208;  dig  products selectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Metallo&#8208;ene Cyclization/Metallo&#8208;carbene Coupling of Allenamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade metallo&#8208;ene/metallo&#8208;carbene coupling reaction was developed to produce 2,3&#8208;dihydropyrrole derivatives in high yields. In this transformation, two new C  sp  3  &#8208;C  sp  2  and C  sp  2  &#8208;C  sp  2  bonds were constructed in one&#8208;pot. The alkene was one of the most easily functionalized groups, making it possible for these molecules to be transformed into more complex molecules. More importantly, the final product possesed an attractive 1,3,5&#8208;trienes scaffold, which was difficult to be synthesized.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidative transformation of substituted furans could be used to access structural analogues of antifungal alkaloids caulindoles A&#8722;D, carbazoles, as well as other indole&#8208;derived molecules.







Abstract
2&#8208;(2&#8208;Acylvinyl)indoles obtained by oxidative rearrangement of substituted 2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminobenzyl)furans could be used to construct structural analogues of antifungal alkaloids caulindoles A&#8722;D as well as other indole&#8208;derived molecules and substituted carbazoles by introducing new reaction centers into the structure of starting materials or by synthetic manipulation with functional groups of the obtained compounds.

         <title>Synthesis, Radiosynthesis and in vitro Studies on Novel Hypoxia PET Tracers Incorporating [18F]FDR</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of five radiotracers incorporating different oxyamine spacers between the hypoxia&#8208;reactive 2&#8208;nitroimidazole moiety and the 5&#8208;[  18  F]&#8208;fluorodeoxyribose ([  18  F]FDR,  12  ) prosthetic group: three linear alkyl chains with 3, 5, 7 carbon atoms (  15a&#8208;c  ), a cyclopropyl ring (  15d  ) and a 1,4&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole (  15e  ). Experiments in hypoxic cells showed that  15d  displays superior uptake kinetics &#8211; and similar selectivity for hypoxic cells &#8211; relative to the gold standard hypoxia tracers [  18  F]fluoroazomycin arabinoside ([  18  F]FAZA) and [  18  F]fluoromisonidazole ([  18  F]FMISO). Lipophilicity and structural rigidity have strong influence on the selectivity of tracers  15  towards hypoxic cells: the lead tracer  15d  displays a logP = 0.38 and the most rigid spacer. A sixth radiotracer (  15f  ), with a 2&#8208;  H  &#8208;imidazole replacing the 2&#8208;nitroimidazole moiety of  15d  , was used to demonstrate that the cyclopropyl group does not play a meaningful role in the sensitivity towards hypoxia.</dc:description>

         <title>C(sp2)&#8722;Si Bond Functionalization through Intramolecular Activation by Alkoxides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows the two possible tracks that trains can follow at a fork. This rail metaphor illustrates how an intermediate can evolve along two distinct pathways in C(sp2)&#8211;Si bond functionalizations via intramolecular activation by alkoxides. Such processes involve the formation of a common cyclic hypervalent silicon intermediate that allows the carbon&#8208;to&#8208;oxygen migration of the organosilyl group and thus the formation of a carbanionic species. The C(sp2)&#8211;Si bond cleavage can be either &#8220;endocyclic&#8221; (Brook rearrangement, right tracks) or &#8220;exocyclic&#8221;(left tracks). Cover design by Kajetan Bijouard. More information can be found in the Minireview by J. Oble, A. Perez&#8208;Luna et&#8197;al.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed [3+1+1] Annulation of Nitrones with Isocyanoacetates as an Approach to 1,4,5&#8208;Trisubstituted Imidazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 6, Page 964-968, February 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silver&#8208;catalyzed protocol for [3+1+1] annulation of nitrones and isocyanoacetates is reported. The reaction is proposed to proceed through sequential [3+2] cycloaddition, ring&#8208;opening, cyclization&#8208;oxidation, and dealkylation, allowing access to a broad scope of valuable polysubstituted imidazoles in high yields.

&lt;p&gt;A silver&#8208;catalyzed protocol for [3+1+1] annulation of nitrones and isocyanoacetates is reported. The reaction is proposed to proceed through sequential [3+2] cycloaddition, ring&#8208;opening, cyclization&#8208;oxidation, and dealkylation, allowing access to a broad scope of valuable polysubstituted imidazoles in high yields.

The Front Cover shows four diastereoisomeric molecular cages based on cyclotriveratrylene (CTV) and sucrose units connected via p&#8208;phenylene linkers. The few steps reaction between CTV and sucrose derivatives leads to, very uncommon, enantiopure C1 symmetrical hemicryptophanes. Combination of chiral, naturally occurring sucrose scaffold with CTV unit ensures a unique shape of the cages. These chiral cages were successfully separated using preparative HPLC, and their absolute configuration was determined by advanced NMR techniques and ECD spectroscopy supported by DFT calculations. More information can be found in the Full Paper by &#321;. Szyszka, S. Jarosz et&#8197;al.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Formation of &#948;&#8208;Lactones by Cerium&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Coupling of &#946;&#8208;Oxoesters with Enol Acetates</title>

The mechanism of the cerium&#8208;catalyzed radical coupling reaction of &#946;&#8208;oxoesters, enol acetates, and dioxygen was elucidated by the introduction of cyclopropyl substituents and stereocenters in the starting materials. The 1,2&#8208;alkyl shift within the endoperoxidic oxycarbenium intermediate proceeded with retention of configuration.







Abstract
&#948;&#8208;Valerolactone derivatives are formed by the cerium&#8208;catalyzed, aerobic coupling of &#946;&#8208;oxoesters with enol acetates and dioxygen. The products possess a 1,4&#8208;diketone moiety, thus, the conversion can be regarded as an Umpolung since the &#946;&#8208;oxoesters are oxidized to electrophilic &#945;&#8208;radicals. The transformation has similarities to the Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation (BVO) where the higher substituted residue migrates. An endoperoxidic oxycarbenium ion comparable to the Criegee intermediate in the BVO is proposed as a reaction intermediate in this case of the oxidative C&#8722;C coupling reaction, but in contrast to the BVO, the less substituted alkyl residue migrates. It was demonstrated by the conversion of &#946;&#8208;oxoesters with two stereocenters that this 1,2&#8208;alkyl shift proceeds with retention of configuration. A radical chain mechanism of the coupling reaction was furthermore evidenced by the conversion of enol acetates and &#946;&#8208;oxoesters with cyclopropyl substituents. Isolation and characterization of products with opened cyclopropane rings established the constitution of radical intermediates.

The potential of &#8220;customizable units&#8221; to create structural diversity for biological screenings is highlighted in this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept synthesis of new peptides related to the potent antitumoral Sansalvamide A. The selective modification of a parent peptide with a customizable Hyp unit rapidly afforded differently N1&#8208;substituted linear and cyclic peptides. Hits with promising activity against MCF7 breast cancer line were detected therefrom.







Abstract
The potential of &#8220;customizable units&#8221; to generate structural diversity for biological screenings is highlighted in this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept synthesis of new peptides related to the potent antitumoral Sansalvamide A. Using L&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyproline (Hyp) as a customizable unit in a linear parent peptide, an improved procedure for selective peptide modification was developed. A divergent Hyp scission&#8208;reductive amination process was carried out, affording five linear peptides with cationic residues, and notably, an N&#8208;alkyl moiety that affected the conformation of the peptide. After two steps (saponification and macrocyclization), sixteen differently N1&#8208;substituted linear and cyclic peptides were obtained. For the first time, the activity of the linear and cyclic compounds was compared. Not only some linear analogs but also cyclic compounds with scarcely studied cationic residues were active against MCF7 breast cancer line. Thus, the structural diversity generated from customizable units can be valuable in drug discovery.

         <title>Recent Advances in Tris&#8208;Primary Amine Based Organic Imine Cages and Related Amine Macrocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 6, Page 861-876, February 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular integration of Tris&#8208;primary amine moiety and multiple aldehyde centers often leads to organic imine cages (OICs) and related amine macrocycles which demand commendable position in the field of material science and supramolecular chemistry. In this review we highlighted recent studies regarding the synthesis and special features of such OICs and their saturated counterparts.






Molecules bearing three primary amine groups are ubiquitous substances in various fields of synthetic chemistry. Some of them are commercially available and the rests are emerged from the designed protocols of synthetic chemists. It has been observed that such aliphatic as well as aromatic triamines are excellent precursors for the design and synthesis of various cage molecules of which organic imine cages (OICs) and related amine macrocycles belong to the category of special interest. These compounds possess unique architectures and already made their marks in the field of supramolecular chemistry, synthetic methodology, and material science. In this review we aimed to consider recent reports that highlighted the syntheses, special features, and applications of primary triamine based OICs and related amine macrocycles.

The Cover Feature shows the excited cuckoo dashing out of his (radical) clock, because the mechanism of the cerium&#8208;catalyzed radical coupling reaction of &#946;&#8208;oxoesters, enol acetates, and dioxygen was finally elucidated by the introduction of cyclopropyl substituents as radical clocks. Furthermore, the introduction of stereocenters in the starting materials causes a stir, since the 1,2&#8208;alkyl shift within the endoperoxidic oxycarbenium intermediate was proved to proceed with retention of configuration. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J. Christoffers et&#8197;al.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Cover Feature&lt;/b&gt; shows the excited cuckoo dashing out of his (radical) clock, because the mechanism of the cerium&#8208;catalyzed radical coupling reaction of &#946;&#8208;oxoesters, enol acetates, and dioxygen was finally elucidated by the introduction of cyclopropyl substituents as radical clocks. Furthermore, the introduction of stereocenters in the starting materials causes a stir, since the 1,2&#8208;alkyl shift within the endoperoxidic oxycarbenium intermediate was proved to proceed with retention of configuration.

syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;Diols are valuable scaffolds for building a vast number of biologically active compounds and are also important synthetic intermediates in organic synthesis. This review focuses on a concise summary of the main metal&#8208;catalyzed methods of olefin syn&#8208;dihydroxylation developed over the past ten years to circumvent the use of osmium.






The syn&#8208;dihydroxylation of olefinic group is one of the most important synthetic transformations which leads to the controlled formation of syn&#8208;diol. Such 1,2&#8208;diol structure is integrated into more complex architectures and substantially participates in the development of biologically active molecules and other fine chemicals. This minireview describes recent evolution of this research field in the past decade, surveying osmium&#8208;free and more eco&#8208;compatible system and in particular the direct oxidation of olefins catalyzed by transition metal complexes.

A visible light&#8208;intduced/phosphate&#8208;mediated light&#8208;induced Minisci&#8208;type reaction under metal&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free condition was developed, which provided an efficient and environmentally friendly way to access functionalized N&#8208;heteroarenes. The transformation underwent a radical pathway, and the diphenyl phosphate played a key role in the catalytic cycle via hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
Herein, we report an environmentally&#8208;friendly light&#8208;induced Minisci alkylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes with a broad substrate scope using diphenyl phosphate as catalyst under metal&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions. The radical precursor redox&#8208;active esters (RAEs) were introduced as alkylating reagents for the functionalization of N&#8208;heteroarene derivatives including pyridine, quinoline, and isoquinoline. Mechanistic studies suggested that diphenyl phosphate played a key role via hydrogen bonding in the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Synthesis, Structural, and Conformational Analysis of 4&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;Ethyl&#8208;Uridine Modified Nucleosides</title>

Bi&#8208;functional modifications at 2&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8208;positions of sugar ring and their incorporation in oligonucleotides have shown a profound impact on the sugar conformation and biological properties of the therapeutic oligonucleotides. Moreover, sugar puckering and bond orientation play a major role in duplex stability. In this study, we focus on the synthesis, crystal structure, and detailed computational analysis of various 2&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8208;modified nucleosides, and their effect on duplex stability.







Abstract
Sugar modifications have attracted much attention due to their potential structural and functional influence on therapeutic nucleic acids. Herein, we report the synthesis of dual modified 4&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;azidomethyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;ethyl&#8208;uridine (4&#8242;&#8208;AzM&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;OEt&#8722;U) and 4&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;ethyl&#8208;uridine (4&#8242;&#8208;AM&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;OEt&#8722;U) nucleosides using linear multi&#8208;step synthesis (16 linear steps). Additionally, we report an alternative route for the synthesis of 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;ethyl&#8208;uridine nucleoside which has been achieved in three steps with an overall yield of 40&#8201;%. X&#8208;ray structure of 4&#8242;&#8208;AzM&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;OEt&#8722;U illustrates that the nucleoside adopts C2&#8242;&#8208;endo (South) conformation having a DNA&#8208;type glycosidic bond (&#967;) angle of &#8722;116.01&#176;. Computational studies revealed the C2&#8242;&#8208;endo and C4&#8242;&#8208;exo conformations for 4&#8242;&#8208;AzM&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;OEt&#8722;U and 4&#8242;&#8208;AM&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;OEt&#8722;U free nucleosides, respectively. The C4&#8242;&#8208;exo conformation in 4&#8242;&#8208;AM&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;OEt&#8722;U free nucleoside is collectively stabilized by various non&#8208;covalent interactions between positively charged aminomethyl and 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyl groups.

&lt;p&gt;Bi&#8208;functional modifications at 2&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8208;positions of sugar ring and their incorporation in oligonucleotides have shown a profound impact on the sugar conformation and biological properties of the therapeutic oligonucleotides. Moreover, sugar puckering and bond orientation play a major role in duplex stability. In this study, we focus on the synthesis, crystal structure, and detailed computational analysis of various 2&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8208;modified nucleosides, and their effect on duplex stability.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sugar modifications have attracted much attention due to their potential structural and functional influence on therapeutic nucleic acids. Herein, we report the synthesis of dual modified 4&#8242;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;azidomethyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;ethyl&#8208;uridine (4&#8242;&#8208;AzM&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;OEt&#8722;U) and 4&#8242;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;ethyl&#8208;uridine (4&#8242;&#8208;AM&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;OEt&#8722;U) nucleosides using linear multi&#8208;step synthesis (16 linear steps). Additionally, we report an alternative route for the synthesis of 2&#8242;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;ethyl&#8208;uridine nucleoside which has been achieved in three steps with an overall yield of 40&#8201;%. X&#8208;ray structure of 4&#8242;&#8208;AzM&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;OEt&#8722;U illustrates that the nucleoside adopts C2&#8242;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;South&lt;/i&gt;) conformation having a DNA&#8208;type glycosidic bond (&#967;) angle of &#8722;116.01&#176;. Computational studies revealed the C2&#8242;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt; and C4&#8242;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt; conformations for 4&#8242;&#8208;AzM&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;OEt&#8722;U and 4&#8242;&#8208;AM&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;OEt&#8722;U free nucleosides, respectively. The C4&#8242;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt; conformation in 4&#8242;&#8208;AM&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;OEt&#8722;U free nucleoside is collectively stabilized by various non&#8208;covalent interactions between positively charged aminomethyl and 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyl groups. Insights into the structural and conformational analysis of dual sugar modified nucleosides and oligonucleotides will be helpful in the rational design of modified nucleosides and therapeutic oligonucleotides.&lt;/p&gt;

The synthesis of four diastereoisomeric molecular cages based on CTV and sucrose moieties connected with p&#8208;phenylene linkers is reported. These compounds were structurally characterized by advanced NMR and ECD spectroscopies. In case of P&#8208;4&#8201;b cage, a crystal structure was obtained. The binding studies towards small ammonium salts were investigated.







Abstract
Four diastereomeric molecular cages based on cyclotriveratrylene (CTV) and sucrose scaffolds, connected via p&#8208;phenylene linkers, were synthesized in a few steps synthesis. The absolute configuration of these diastereoisomers was determined by advanced NMR and ECD spectroscopies supported by DFT calculations. The X&#8208;Ray crystal structure of P&#8208;4&#8201;b cage gave an insight into its unique structure. The binding properties of P&#8208;4&#8201;a and M&#8208;4&#8201;a cages towards small ammonium guests (1&#8208;methylpyridinium and 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolium salts) were investigated.

On&#8208;resin disulfide bond formation using methyl 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinesulfenate (Npys&#8208;OMe) has been developed, leading to fully&#8208;automated protocol for the synthesis of cyclic disulfide peptides. Using this strategy, the on&#8208;resin synthesis of monocyclic oxytocin, melanin&#8208;concentrating hormone and bicyclic &#945;&#8208;conotoxin ImI was successfully accomplished.







Abstract
New methodologies for the construction of full peptide structures with all disulfide bonds on the resin are attractive for the development of solid phase peptide synthesis. Detailed reaction conditions for the on&#8208;resin disulfide bond formation have been investigated using a mild and chemically stable oxidizing reagent, methyl 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinesulfenate (Npys&#8208;OMe). Monocyclic oxytocin, MCH and bicyclic &#945;&#8208;conotoxin ImI were synthesized in both semi&#8208;automated and full&#8208;automated protocols. It was found that on&#8208;resin intramolecular disulfide bond formation with Npys&#8208;OMe proceeds with the minimal formation of peptide oligomers by adopting a solvent system with 0.4&#8197;M LiCl/DMF. Crude peptides with complete disulfide bond patterns can be obtained in high purity using both protocols. This minimized the RP&#8208;HPLC purification step and the desired peptides were obtained with better yields. To our knowledge, this is the first fully automated construction of a bicyclic disulfide peptide on resin with more than 50&#8201;% purity in Fmoc&#8208;based SPPS. These results suggest that Npys&#8208;OMe is a useful reagent for the disulfide bond formation in automated protocols.

         <title>A One&#8208;Pot Two&#8208;Step Enzymatic Pathway for the Synthesis of Enantiomerically Enriched Vicinal Diols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 6, Page 973-978, February 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A variegated library of syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols has been successfully prepared by an unprecedent one&#8208;pot two step protocol. In this report a ThDP&#8208;dependent lyase (Ao&#8201;:&#8201;DCPIP OR) and a NADH&#8208;dependent reductase (AAR) have been consecutively employed in two steps without intermediate work&#8208;up and purification, affording enantiomerically enriched 1,2&#8208;diols in good yield (up to 78&#8201;%). The reductase cloning and overexpression is herein reported for the first time.







Abstract
Enantiomerically enriched 1,2&#8208;diols are prominent compounds that find numerous applications in organic chemistry. They are privileged building blocks for the synthesis of APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients), broadly used as chiral ligands in asymmetric catalysis, and efficient auxiliaries employed to control the stereochemical outcome of total synthesis. Among the number of strategies developed for the preparation of these molecules, enzyme mediated reactions have gained a crucial role in the toolbox of organic chemists for their high efficiency and sustainability. Herein we describe a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step protocol designed by combining a thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)&#8208;dependent lyase and a NADH&#8208;dependent reductase. The ThDP&#8208;dependent acetoin:dichlorophenolindophenol oxidoreductase (Ao&#8201;:&#8201;DCPIP OR) is exploited to produce enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;hydroxyketones through the benzoin&#8208;type condensation of methylacetoin with either aldehydes or activated ketones. The enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;hydroxyketones undergo the selective reduction into the corresponding 1,2&#8208;diols in the same reaction mixture due to the addition of NAD+ and of the NADH&#8208;dependent acetylacetoin reductase (AAR). Sodium formate was selected as the sacrificial reductive reactant to generate and recycle in&#8197;situ the precious NADH by formate&#8208;dehydrogenase.

     alt="A One&#8208;Pot Two&#8208;Step Enzymatic Pathway for the Synthesis of Enantiomerically Enriched Vicinal Diols"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variegated library of &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols has been successfully prepared by an unprecedent one&#8208;pot two step protocol. In this report a ThDP&#8208;dependent lyase (Ao&#8201;:&#8201;DCPIP OR) and a NADH&#8208;dependent reductase (AAR) have been consecutively employed in two steps without intermediate work&#8208;up and purification, affording enantiomerically enriched 1,2&#8208;diols in good yield (up to 78&#8201;%). The reductase cloning and overexpression is herein reported for the first time.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enantiomerically enriched 1,2&#8208;diols are prominent compounds that find numerous applications in organic chemistry. They are privileged building blocks for the synthesis of APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients), broadly used as chiral ligands in asymmetric catalysis, and efficient auxiliaries employed to control the stereochemical outcome of total synthesis. Among the number of strategies developed for the preparation of these molecules, enzyme mediated reactions have gained a crucial role in the toolbox of organic chemists for their high efficiency and sustainability. Herein we describe a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step protocol designed by combining a thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)&#8208;dependent lyase and a NADH&#8208;dependent reductase. The ThDP&#8208;dependent acetoin:dichlorophenolindophenol oxidoreductase (Ao&#8201;:&#8201;DCPIP OR) is exploited to produce enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;hydroxyketones through the benzoin&#8208;type condensation of methylacetoin with either aldehydes or activated ketones. The enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;hydroxyketones undergo the selective reduction into the corresponding 1,2&#8208;diols in the same reaction mixture due to the addition of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and of the NADH&#8208;dependent acetylacetoin reductase (AAR). Sodium formate was selected as the sacrificial reductive reactant to generate and recycle &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; the precious NADH by formate&#8208;dehydrogenase. Unprecedented reported details on the cloning and expression of the AAR are reported as well.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative Cyclization: Synthesis of Polysubstituted Pyrrole from Enamines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 6, Page 951-955, February 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diverse polysubstituted pyrroles were synthesized through electrochemical oxidative cyclization of enamines under mild conditions. By avoiding the use of metal catalysts and oxidants, this method is both more environmentally friendly and atomic economic than other synthetic protocols.







Abstract
A conceptually novel method for the preparation of pyrrole is described by electrochemical&#8208;oxidation&#8208;induced intermolecular annulation via enamines. In a simple undivided cell, based on a sodium acetate&#8208;facilitated, polysubstituted pyrrole derivations has been facilely synthesized under external oxidant&#8208;free condition. This electrosynthetic approach providing an environmentally benign protocol for C&#8722;C bond cross&#8208;coupling and oxidative annulation, which features unparalleled broad scope of substrates and practicality.

         <title>An Adaptive Resorcinarene Hemicarcerand</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 6, Page 1026-1034, February 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seven inclusion complexes of a newly developed resorcinarene&#8208;based hemicarcerand with up to two guests are studied via single&#8208;crystal XRD and NMR, exhibiting packing coefficients between 55&#8201;% and 91&#8201;%. The molecular capsule accommodates guests of different dimensions and electrostatic surface potentials by adapting its cavity volume and shape. A clear selectivity for p&#8208;xylene over m&#8208;xylene is observed.







Abstract
A new resorcinarene&#8208;based hemicarcerand was developed, exhibiting pronounced flexibility in size and shape to accommodate several guest molecules. With a series of seven hemicarceplexes, investigated via single&#8208;crystal XRD, the cage molecule showed to align its guests to complement their electrostatic potentials and to adjust its dimensions, according to the guest molecule&#8216;s demand. Though forming equimolar inclusion complexes with most guests, crystallization from chloroform, and benzonitrile produced hemicarceplexes with a guest/host ratio of 2&#8201;:&#8201;1, exhibiting packing coefficients as high as 91&#8201;%. In competition experiments, the hemicarcerand clearly favors p&#8208;xylene over m&#8208;xylene: The host shows to crystallize, solely incarcerating p&#8208;xylene from a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of the two xylenes, and also isolates p&#8208;xylene from the mixture via amorphous precipitation.

Substituted benzotriazoles are prepared from arynes and azides in a metal&#8208;free [3+2] cycloaddition within minutes. Using a flow reactor, thermal strain of hazardous azides is minimized for a readily scalable and safe process.







Abstract
A method for the metal&#8208;free synthesis of benzotriazoles in flow is reported. Using azides and in&#8197;situ generated arynes, benzotriazoles are formed in a [3+2] cycloaddition within minutes. Employing different substitution patterns of the azide and aryne coupling partners, a modular access to benzotriazoles is provided. Thermal strain of hazardous azides and accumulation of reactive intermediates is minimized by short reaction times in flow, improving the safety profile of the process. The scalability of the reaction is demonstrated.

         <title>Molecular Recognition by Chalcogen Bond: Selective Charge&#8208;Transfer Crystal Formation of Dimethylnaphthalene with Selenadiazolotetracyanonaphthoquinodimethane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 6, Page 990-997, February 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly selective cocrystallization with 2,6&#8208;dimethylnaphthalene (2,6&#8208;DMN) allows the title selenadiazole&#8208;based electron acceptor to separate 2,6&#8208;DMN from the isomer mixture by an effective Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N chalcogen bond whereas the sulfur congener shows only low selectivity due to the competing C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bond, which overwhelms the S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N bond.







Abstract
The title nonplanar electron acceptor (1) fused with a selenadiazole ring selectively forms a crystalline charge&#8208;transfer complex (CT crystal) with 2,6&#8208;dimethylnaphthalene (2,6&#8208;DMN). On the other hand, the sulfur analogue (2) has less recognition ability and forms CT crystals with both 2,6&#8208; and 2,7&#8208;DMN. X&#8208;ray analyses of 1, 2, and their CT crystals revealed that the Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N chalcogen bond (ChB) in 1 is strong enough to determine the crystal packing with the formation of a cavity suitable for 2,6&#8208;DMN. On the contrary, ChB through S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N contact in 2 competes with other weak interactions such as a C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bond.

     alt="Molecular Recognition by Chalcogen Bond: Selective Charge&#8208;Transfer Crystal Formation of Dimethylnaphthalene with Selenadiazolotetracyanonaphthoquinodimethane"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly selective cocrystallization with 2,6&#8208;dimethylnaphthalene (2,6&#8208;DMN) allows the title selenadiazole&#8208;based electron acceptor to separate 2,6&#8208;DMN from the isomer mixture by an effective Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N chalcogen bond whereas the sulfur congener shows only low selectivity due to the competing C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bond, which overwhelms the S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N bond.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title nonplanar electron acceptor (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) fused with a selenadiazole ring selectively forms a crystalline charge&#8208;transfer complex (CT crystal) with 2,6&#8208;dimethylnaphthalene (2,6&#8208;DMN). On the other hand, the sulfur analogue (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) has less recognition ability and forms CT crystals with both 2,6&#8208; and 2,7&#8208;DMN. X&#8208;ray analyses of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, and their CT crystals revealed that the Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N chalcogen bond (ChB) in &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is strong enough to determine the crystal packing with the formation of a cavity suitable for 2,6&#8208;DMN. On the contrary, ChB through S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N contact in &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; competes with other weak interactions such as a C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bond. The stronger ChB involving Se is the key for &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; to separate 2,6&#8208;DMN (&amp;gt;97&#8197;wt&#8201;%) from a complex isomer mixture containing ca. 10&#8197;wt&#8201;% each of 2,6&#8208; and 2,7&#8208;DMN by a simple, efficient and straightforward mixing&#8208;filtration&#8208;heating process.&lt;/p&gt;

Reactions of a novel propyne iminium salt, N,N&#8208;dimethyl 3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;propyne iminium triflate, with electron&#8208;rich heteroaromatic ring systems (furans, thiophenes, pyrroles) are reported.

Abstract
Reactions of a novel propyne iminium salt, N,N&#8208;dimethyl 3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;propyne iminium triflate, with electron&#8208;rich heteroaromatic ring systems (furans, thiophenes, pyrroles) are reported. The 1&#8208;CF3&#8208;propyne iminium ion can act as a highly reactive ambident electrophile, giving rise to simple electrophilic heteroaromatic ring substitution products, and as a 1,3&#8208;biselectrophile leading to C2+C3&#8208;CF3 annulation products. Moreover, it is an electron&#8208;deficient alkyne which was found to afford double [2+2] cycloaddition products with 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran and 2,5&#8208;dimethylthiophene. The obtained molecular structures include CF3&#8208;containing compounds with cyclopenta[b]furan, cyclopenta[b]thiophene, cyclopenta[c]thiophene, cyclopenta[b]pyrrole, cyclopenta[c]pyrrole, 3H&#8208;pyrrolizine, and 1,4&#8208;dihydrocyclopenta[b]pyrrole ring systems. Analogous reactions of 1,3(or 1,4)&#8208;phenylenebis(1&#8208;CF3&#8208;propyne iminium) salts with furans, pyrroles or thiophenes in a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry lead to phenylene&#8208;tethered condensed heterocycles of the same type.

A Cu0&#8208;catalyzed protocol is proposed for the synthesis of 8&#8208;acylquinolines through a [3+2+1] annulation starting from anthranils and phenylacetaldehydes. This protocol is of particular interest in preparing 8&#8208;aldehyde quinolines, which have been hard to access so far. Both AgOTf and dioxygen played an important role in the reaction. C3&#8208;heterocycle or phenylethylene substituted anthranils could also be employed in the reaction. An interesting esterification of aldehyde was observed.

Trifluoromethylation of aldehydes with subsequent derivatization using pentafluoropyridine provides pyridinyl ethers which undergo light mediated substitution by dithiocarbamate anion, affording fluorinated dithiocarbamates.







Abstract
A method for the synthesis of trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted dithiocarbamates from aldehydes is described. The reaction involves nucleophilic trifluoromethylation, derivatization of the silyloxy&#8208;group with pentafluoropyridine, and substitution of the fluorinated pyridinyloxy group by dithiocarbamate anion. The substitution step is performed in the presence of 12&#8208;phenyl&#8208;12H&#8208;benzo[b]phenothiazine and copper cyanide under irradiation of 400&#8197;nm LED.

         <title>Last of the gem&#8208;Difluorocycloalkanes 2: Synthesis of Fluorinated Cycloheptane Building Blocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isomeric gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane derivatives were obtained in two to six synthetic steps from readily available starting materials. The developed synthetic approaches were shown to be efficient for a multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of target compounds and involved six&#8208;membered ring homologation and/or deoxofluorination reactions as the key steps.







Abstract
The gem&#8208;difluorocycloalkane family was extended to all possible regioisomers of the gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane, monofunctionalized by carboxilic&#8208;, amino&#8208; or keto&#8208; group, that were synthesized on a multigram scale. The preparation of the corresponding building blocks was achieved from readily accessible starting materials either via six&#8208;membered ring homologation or deoxofluorination of the appropriate seven&#8208;membered cyclic ketones.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of (2S,6R)&#8208;Diamino&#8208;(5R,7)&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;heptanoic Acid (DADH): An Unusual Amino Acid from Streptomyces sp. SANK 60404</title>

         <dc:description>
Stereoselective synthesis of (2S,6R)&#8208;diamino&#8208;(5R,7)&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;heptanoic acid (DADH) was achieved for the first time. The three stereogenic centers of DADH were constructed by chemical manipulation of Garner's aldehyde as a chiral source and chiral DuPHOS&#8208;Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of a dehydroamino acid ester. This method also enabled the flexible synthesis of the DADH stereoisomer from Garner's aldehyde.







Abstract
Stereoselective synthesis of (2S,6R)&#8208;diamino&#8208;(5R,7)&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;heptanoic acid (DADH), a biosynthetic precursor of vazabitide A, isolated from Streptomyces sp. SANK 60404 was achieved for the first time. Three stereogenic centers of DADH were constructed by the chemical manipulation on Garner's aldehyde as a chiral source and DuPHOS&#8208;Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of a dehydroamino acid ester. The synthetic advantage of the present method was demonstrated by the flexible synthesis of the DADH stereoisomers from Garner's aldehyde.

         <title>Iridium Complexes as Efficient Catalysts for Construction of &#945;&#8208;Substituted Ketones via Hydrogen Borrowing of Alcohols in Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ketones are of great importance in synthesis, biology and pharmaceuticals. This paper reports an iridium complexes&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of alcohols via hydrogen borrowing, affording a series of  &#945;  &#8208;alkylated ketones in high yield (86%~95%) and chemoselectivities (&gt;99:1). This methodology has the advantages of low catalyst loading (0.1 mol%) and environmentally benign water as the solvent. Studies have shown the amount of base has great impact on chemoselectivities. Meanwhile, deuteration experiments show water plays an important role in accelerating the reduction of the unsaturated ketones intermediates. Remarkably, gram&#8208;scale experiment demonstrates this methodology of iridium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of alcohols has potential application in practical synthesis of  &#945;  &#8208;alkylated ketones.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Arylboration of Conjugated Dienes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nickel&#8208;catalyzed arylboration of conjugated dienes is reported. Good 1,4&#8208;regioselectivity and (  E  )&#8208;stereoselectivity were obtained using isoprene, together with very good 1,2&#8208;regioselectivity and (  E  )&#8208;stereoselectivity using 1&#8208;arylbutadienes. The high reactivity and selectivity of this process were dependent on the use of the appropriate nitrogen&#8208;based ligand. Moreover, wide functional group tolerance was observed under mild reaction conditions. This protocol provides a path to allyl or homoallyl boronic ester derivatives starting from 1,3&#8208;dienes, aryl bromides and B  2  pin  2  . The downstream transformation of allyl boronic esters was also achieved, suggesting a strategy for the diastereoselective 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of isoprene and demonstrating the potential for the synthesis of complex molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective sp3 C&#8722;H Arylation of Primary Aliphatic Amines: Mechanistic Studies and Synthetic Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3&#8208;Bromo&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde has been used as an efficient transient directing group (TDG) in the Pd&#8208;catalyzed sp3&#8722;C&#8722;H arylation of primary amines in &#947;&#8208;position. These experimental findings have been corroborated by computational studies. Further functionalization (tandem oxidation) and synthetic application were also achieved with the presented Pd/TDG catalytic approach.







Abstract
The Pd&#8208;catalyzed &#947;&#8208;position sp3&#8722;C&#8722;H arylation of primary amines bearing an aliphatic chain or cycloalkyl substituent and related mechanistic studies are disclosed. 3&#8208;Bromo&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde plays a key role in &#947;&#8208;position sp3&#8722;C&#8722;H arylation as a transient directing group (TDG) to assist the regio&#8208; and stereoselective C&#8722;H activation of a Pd catalyst, and the development of a tandem reaction to transform 1&#176;&#8208;amines into &#947;&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted ketones demonstrates synthetic utility. Density functional theory (DFT)&#8208;based calculations revealed the detailed reaction mechanism and the origins of the high selectivity (&#947;&#8208;position and cis&#8208;only). The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the isolated endo&#8208;palladacycle intermediate supported the DFT results, and a kinetic isotope experiment confirmed the results of DFT calculations indicating that the C&#8722;H activation step via simultaneous palladation and deprotonation is rate&#8208;determining.

         <title>Synthesis, Self&#8208;Assembly, and Nucleic Acid Recognition of an Acylhydrazone&#8208;Conjugated Cationic Tetraphenylethene Ligand</title>

TPE&#8208;Gir self&#8208;assembles into fluorescent nanoparticles and interact with nucleic acids (single&#8208; and double&#8208;stranded DNA), with selective binding to G&#8208;quadruplexes.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers are of interest in the pursuit of multivalent nucleic acids recognition. However, their formation often relies on non&#8208;covalent forces that are also at play in the interaction with nucleic acids. In this work, we designed a novel compound (TPE&#8208;Gir) combining a tetraphenylethene aromatic core tethered to four quaternary ammoniums through acylhydrazone spacers, and we investigated in detail its self&#8208;assembly and interaction with different types of nucleic acids. The spectroscopic analyses indicate the self&#8208;assembly of regular fluorescent nanoparticles (observed by DLS and TEM) in the absence of nucleic acids, the strong propensity to intercalate into single&#8208;stranded DNA, the ability to bind into the minor groove of double&#8208;stranded DNA, and the selective binding to G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures by fitting within a wide G4&#8208;groove. Those recognition events are quantified by isothermal titration calorimetry and the proposed binding models are supported by docking simulations.

         <title>Methylthiolation for Electron&#8208;rich Heteroarenes with DMSO&#8208;TsCl</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DMSO&#8208;TsCl has been developed for direct methylthiolation of various electron&#8208;rich heteroarenes (more than 40 examples) with high regioselectivity in moderate to excellent yields (up to 96%). Especially, pyrroles, furans and thiophenes can be efficiently mono&#8208;methylthiolated. This practical method features scalable, metal&#8208;free, mild conditions which are compatible with air and moisture. Several applications of methylthiolated product were demonstrated for the first time. Based on controlled experimental results, a plausible mechanism was proposed with two key intermediates involved in mechanism being detected by HRMS.</dc:description>

         <title>Diaryliodonium salts in Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Chelation&#8208;Induced C(sp2/sp3)&#8208;H Arylations</title>

         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed Cross&#8208;coupling via directing group assisted C&#8208;H bond activation has become an expedient tool in current synthesis to achieve diverse molecular complexity. In this context, chelation&#8208;assisted arylations of C(sp2/sp3)&#8211;H bonds have been extensively investigated as aryl/biaryl derivatives are an important contributor in the area of the industry, farming, medicinal and material science. The diaryliodonium salt has been broadly utilized in C(sp2/sp3)&#8211;H bond arylation where the reaction proceeds via oxidative addition of aryliodonium salt to chelation induced metallacycle. The proximal/remote C(sp2/sp3)&#8211;H bonds in coordination with transition metals are arylated by a range of directing groups in good to excellent yields. In this mini&#8208;review, we have outlined the up to date developments on transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed chelation assisted C(sp2/sp3)&#8211;H bond arylation utilizing diaryliodonium salts as the coupling partner.</dc:description>

         <title>Monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted (aza)spiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted spiro[2.3]hexane and 5&#8208;azaspiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. In both cases, the method relied on the cyclopropa&#173;nation of the corresponding cyclobutane or azetidine derivatives. In the case of monoprotected 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexanes, the title products were obtained as single diastereomers. X&#8208;Ray diffraction studies supported by exit vector plot (EVP) analysis showed that the obtained building blocks are promising piperidine/cycloalkane isosteres with potential utility to drug discovery. Also, conformations observed in the crystalline state for the two different diastereomers of 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexane derivatives prompt their application in design of &#946;&#8208;turn and sheet&#8208;like peptidomimetics, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>State of the Art of Bodipy&#8208;Based Photocatalysts in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bodipy (Boron&#8208;dipyrromethene) derivatives are important dyes with a variety of applications including functionalized materials, biology, medicine, and organic chemistry. This review covers important developments in the use of Bodipy dyes in synthetic photochemistry.







Abstract
Photochemistry is a tremendous research field offering many synthetic possibilities to chemists. Breakthroughs in this area have been notably driven by the implementation of new classes of photocatalysts. Within this context, Bodipy (Boron&#8208;dipyrromethene) dyes possess attractive chemical and physical features such as their modularity, strong absorption under visible light irradiation, good thermal and photochemical stabilities, and high fluorescence quantum yields. As such, this class of compounds has found widespread applications in functionalized materials, biology, medicine, or organic chemistry. From an organic&#8208;synthetic point of view, excited states of Bodipy dyes have been harnessed in electron and energy transfer reactions. This minireview collates the relevant literature on the applications of these catalysts in synthetic photochemistry and provides some perspectives of this research area.

         <title>Gallium(III) corrole complexes as near&#8208;infrared emitter &#8211; synthesis, computational and photophysical study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the chemical synthesis and characterization of free&#8208;base A 2 B&#8208; and A 3 &#8208; meso &#8208;TIPS ethynyl corroles, which serve as a precursor for metalation with gallium(III)chloride and subsequent in&#8208;situ sila Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction. Under ambient conditions and with a common catalyst system the reaction with different aryliodides proved to be successful. Compared to the well&#8208;known Ga(III)&#8208;pyr&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;trispentafluorophenylcorrole complex, the emission wavelengths of such gallium(III) corroles complexes could be shifted bathochromically by up to ~3100 cm &#8208;1 to the near&#8208;infrared region (NIR). The described synthetic procedure establishes a facile way to obtain organic near&#8208;infrared&#8208;emitters based on gallium(III) meso &#8208;aryl&#8208;ethynyl corrole complexes.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two synthetic strategies towards bulky boranes, boronates and boron ate&#8208;complexes derived from triptycenes have been developed. These approaches started from borylated or brominated anthracenes and involved a Br/Li exchange and [4+2] cycloaddition reaction with  in&#8208;situ  generated benzyne to produce a series of triptycene boronates and borates substituted in positions 1 or 9 with various boron substituents such as BPin, Bneo, BF  3  K and B(Mes)  2  . X&#8208;ray diffraction crystallographic analysis and UV&#8208;Vis/fluorimetric measurements provided quantitative information on the effect of the triptycene scaffold on their structure and their photophysical and electronic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrostatics Favor PNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA Stability over Stereochemistry in Pyrrolidine&#8208;Based Cationic Dual&#8208;Backbone PNA Analogues</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual diaminopyrrolidine based peptide nucleic acid (dapPNA) monomer that give rise to two different PNA backbones (shown in blue &amp; red) was synthesized using orthogonal solid phase chemistry. Presence of free amino group makes PNA cationic and thus not only show high thermal stability in complexation with DNA but also overcomes the unfavorable stereochemical effects.







Abstract
Modifications to the peptide nucleic acid (PNA) backbone has been well known to alter the thermodynamical parameters of PNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA complexes to broaden their utility for different applications. Electrostatic interactions between a modified PNA having a positively charged backbone and the negatively charged DNA has been shown to enhance thermal stabilities of PNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA complexes at various instances. On the other hand, chiral introduction in PNA backbone leads to stereochemical preference that affects binding properties. However, the interplay between electrostatics and stereochemistry has not been systematically studied so far. Herein, we report the synthesis and biophysical characterization of cationic PNA named dapPNA, first of its kind, having a dual PNA backbone constituting of a pyrrolidine ring having a &#946;&#8208;substitution. One of the aims of this study was to investigate the role of electrostatics over stereochemical preferences. The results show that electrostatic attraction between cationic dapPNA and negatively charged DNA overcomes the unfavorable stereochemical effects and enhances stability of PNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA complexes. Moreover, two different PNA backbones derived from a single PNA monomer expands the repertoire of pyrrolidine based PNA analogues.

Abstract
Introduction of a perfluorophenyloxy group at the 5&#8208;position of 3,3&#8208;dibutyl&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3H&#8208;indole efficiently promotes aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement in both the crystalline solid&#8208;state and in highly concentrated ethanolic solutions of the resultant analog. The phenomenon is attributed to aggregate formation, arising from perfluorophenyl&#8208;perfluorophenyl stacking between the 3H&#8208;indole units, the occurrence of which was deduced from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of 3,3&#8208;dibutyl&#8208;5&#8208;perfluorophenyloxy&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3H&#8208;indole.

         <title>The Chemistry of High&#8208;Oxidation State Securinega Alkaloids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;oxidation state securinega alkaloids were categorized into five groups based on their structural phenotype. All known syntheses of high&#8208;oxidation state securinega were summarized with an emphasis on key transformations. Notable interplays between chemical synthesis and biosynthesis within this family of natural products are delineated.







Abstract
Securinega alkaloids have fascinated the chemical community for over six decades. Among these intriguing secondary metabolites, there are members that are biosynthesized via oxidation(s) of the basic tetracyclic core of securinega natural products. These oxidation processes result in a sub&#8208;family of natural products with intriguing structural variations. We have grouped them as &#8220;high&#8208;oxidation state&#8221; securinega alkaloids. In this minireview, we, for the first time, categorize high&#8208;oxidation state securinega alkaloids into five groups based on their structural phenotype. We then describe all known syntheses of high&#8208;oxidation state securinega alkaloids based on our classification. Plausible biosynthetic origins of securinega alkaloids in each group are described. Notable interplays between chemical synthesis and biosynthesis within this family of natural products are depicted. The updated comprehensive investigation of the chemistry of high&#8208;oxidation state securinega alkaloids provides us with an outlook on remaining key challenges related to these fascinating natural products.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;catalyzed electrophilic amination of sodium sulfinates with anthranils to generate N&#8208;(2&#8208;carbonylaryl) benzenesulfonamides with high atom efficiency under redox&#8208;neutral conditions has been developed.







Abstract
A practical method for the synthesis of N&#8208;(2&#8208;carbonylaryl) benzenesulfonamides via an iron&#8208;catalyzed electrophilic amination of sodium sulfinates with anthranils is described. This redox&#8208;neutral transformation has high atom efficiency and is achieved under simple and mild reaction conditions. A wide range of anthranils and sodium sulfinates were compatible in this transformation. Moreover, the synthetic potential of this methodology was further demonstrated by the synthesis of various useful N&#8208;heterocycles and derivatives.

         <title>A Substituent&#8208;Directed Strategy for the Selective Synthesis of L&#8208;Hexoses: An Expeditious Route to L&#8208;Idose</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>L&#8208;Hexoses are rare but biologically significant components of various important biomolecules, however, most are prohibitively expensive if commercially available, limiting their study and biotechnological exploitation. New, efficient methods to access L&#8208;hexoses and their derivatives are thus of great interest. In a previous study, we showcased a stereoselective Bu  3  SnH&#8208;mediated transformation of a 5&#8208;  C  &#8208;bromo&#8208;D&#8208;glucuronide to an L&#8208;iduronide. We have now drawn inspiration from this result to derive a new methodology which can be harnessed to access other L&#8208;hexoses. DFT calculations demonstrate that a combination of a &#946;&#8208;F at the anomeric position and a methoxycarbonyl substituent at C&#8208;5 is key to optimising the selectivity for the L&#8208;hexose product. Our investigations have also culminated in the development of the shortest known synthetic route to a derivative of L&#8208;idose from commercially available starting material (45% yield over 3 steps).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;L&#8208;Hexoses are rare but biologically significant components of various important biomolecules, however, most are prohibitively expensive if commercially available, limiting their study and biotechnological exploitation. New, efficient methods to access L&#8208;hexoses and their derivatives are thus of great interest. In a previous study, we showcased a stereoselective Bu  3  SnH&#8208;mediated transformation of a 5&#8208;  C  &#8208;bromo&#8208;D&#8208;glucuronide to an L&#8208;iduronide.

         <title>A Novel and Practical Continuous Flow Chemical Synthesis of Cannabidiol (CBD) and its CBDV and CBDB Analogues</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flow chemical synthesis has been fruitfully used for synthesizing cannabidiol (CBD) and its analogues cannabidivarin (CBDV) and cannabidibutol (CBDB) in 55&#8201;%, 56&#8201;%, and 59&#8201;% yields respectively. This approach permitted both to synthesize products in very short reaction time (residence time 7&#8197;minutes) and minimized the formation of psychoactive and illegal cannabinoids such a tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).







Abstract
Cannabidiol is one of the main non&#8208;psychoactive cannabinoids present in Cannabis sativa and, in the last decade, it is gaining great interest among the scientific community for its pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and cosmetic applications. Herein, we report the first continuous flow chemical synthesis of cannabidiol (CBD) and its analogues cannabidivarin (CBDV) and cannabidibutol (CBDB). This approach permits to synthesize products in very good yields (55&#8211;59&#8201;%), limiting the formation of psychoactive and illegal cannabinoids such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).

         <title>Photoredox Allylation Reactions Mediated by Bismuth in Aqueous Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green Photoredox! Negligibly toxic bismuth salts can be employed in a photoredox allylation of aldehydes mediated by an organic dye. To further add interest to this new methodology, the photoredox Barbier allylation is carried out in EtOH/water and shows low sensitivity to oxygen and radical scavengers.







Abstract
Organometallic allylic reagents are widely used in the construction of C&#8722;C bonds by Barbier&#8208;type reactions. In this communication, we have described a photoredox Barbier allylation of aldehydes mediated by bismuth, in absence of other metals as co&#8208;reductants. Mild reaction conditions, tolerance of oxygen, and use of aqueous solvent make this photoredox methodology attractive for green and sustainable synthesis of homoallylic alcohols.

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Ring&#8208;Opening of meso&#8208;Epoxides with O&#8208; and N&#8208;Nucleophiles Catalyzed by a Chiral Sc(III)/bipyridine Complex</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A newly designed ligand with the bipyridine scaffold (an analog of Bolm's ligand), in combination with Sc(OTf)3, exhibits high stereocontrol in the ring opening of meso&#8208;epoxides with various alcohols providing 1,2&#8208;alkoxyalcohols.







Abstract
The ring&#8208;opening of epoxides is a synthetically significant process widely applied in all kinds of chemistry. Herein, we report the catalytic and highly enantioselective variant of this reaction exploiting our recent endeavors to design and synthesize chiral bipyridine type ligands. A Sc&#8208;complex with a newly developed bipyridine ligand exhibited high reactivity and stereocontrol in the desymmetrization of meso&#8208;epoxides with various alcohols. The respective enantiomerically enriched 1,2&#8208;alkoxyalcohols were obtained with e.r. values of up to 99.5:0.5 for various alcohols regardless of their nature (benzyl, alkyl, cycloalkyl, allyl, propargyl, etc.). We attempted ring&#8208;opening of meso&#8208;epoxides with anilines as well; however, it proceeded with lower enantioselectivity and was strongly depended on the electronic effect of substituents attached to the aromatic ring.

         <title>Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Annulation of Amidines with Alkynes via Sequential C&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first rhodium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative double C&#8722;H activation/annulation reaction of amidines and alkynes to construct benzimidazoisoquinolines was developed. The operationally simple transformation showed high functional group compatibility and featured the cleavage of the C&#8722;H bonds located on a different moiety of the N&#8208;phenylbenzimidamide substrates.







Abstract
In this paper, a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed sequential two&#8208;fold ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of N&#8208;phenylbenzimidamide with internal alkyne is reported. The double C&#8722;H activations proved viable in a one&#8208;pot fashion with the assistance of C=N and C&#8722;N bonds, providing a series of benzimidazoisoquinolines with high levels of positional selectivity control. The operationally simple transformation showed high functional group compatibility and featured the cleavage of C&#8722;H bonds located on different a moiety of the N&#8208;phenylbenzimidamide substrates. Detailed mechanistic studies provided strong support for C&#8722;H bond cleavage on the N&#8208;phenyl ring to be preferential compared with C&#8722;H bond cleavage on C&#8208;phenyl ring. As a multifunctional catalytic platform, the rhodium catalyst conducted two independent and compatible catalytic cycles in one pot.

         <dc:description>
A Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction of 2&#8208;iodo&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluoroacetophenones, alkynes, and TMSCN for the synthesis of useful difluoroacyl&#8208;substituted nitriles is described. This method has broad substrate scope and excellent stereoselectivity. Preliminary mechanistic investigation indicated that a radical&#8208;mediated process was involved in this cyanodifluoroalkylation reaction.

A Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction of 2&#8208;iodo&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluoroacetophenones, alkynes, and TMSCN is described. The reaction provided a facile method for the synthesis of difluoroacyl&#8208;substituted nitriles, which might be served as potentially useful fluoroorganic intermediates for further transformation in drug discovery. This method has broad substrate scope, good efficiency, and excellent stereoselectivity. Preliminary mechanistic investigation indicated that a radical&#8208;mediated process was involved in this cyanodifluoroalkylation reaction.

         <title>Glycosamine Derivatives Through Metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N Bond Formation on Protected and Unprotected 2&#8208;Iodoglycals</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual nickel/copper&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N bond formation on perbenzylated and protecting group&#8208;free 2&#8208;iodoglycals was developed as straightforward access to glycosamine analogs. Diverse cyclic&#8208; and benzyl amides were successfully introduced in position&#8197;2 of glycal scaffolds. Post&#8208;functionalization by hydrogenolysis of these compounds let to reach mannosamine&#8208; and talosamine&#8208;type derivatives.







Abstract
Glycosamines are important building blocks of natural biopolymers. The development of synthetic routes to such glycoside family is of big interest in terms of biological application. Herein, access to glycosamine derivatives through dual nickel/copper&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N bond formation via a cross&#8208;coupling reaction is presented. Diverse benzyl&#8208; and cyclic amide&#8208;containing glycals were successfully synthesized in moderate to excellent yields starting from perbenzylated and protecting group&#8208;free 2&#8208;iodoglycals. 16 examples presenting d&#8208;glucal or d&#8208;galactal configuration and an electron&#8208;rich or electron&#8208;poor amide moiety in position 2 of the carbohydrate are obtained by this methodology. Post&#8208;functionalization by hydrogenolysis conditions of three synthesized compounds allows access to d&#8208;mannosamine and d&#8208;talosamine mimics.

         <title>Synthesis and Molecular Properties of Partially Fluorinated DNTTs**
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Partially fluorinated dinaphthothienothiophenes (DNTTs) were synthesized via bisthiomethyl alkene intermediates which were accessible by McMurry coupling or Wittig olefination of partially fluorinated naphthalene precursors. The electronic structure of the DNTTs is compared with thiophene and fluorinated naphthalene units.







Abstract
1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrafluoro&#8208;dinaphthothienothiophene (F4DNTT) and 1,2,3,4,8,9,10,11&#8208;octafluoro&#8208;dinaphthothienothiophene (F8DNTT) were synthesized via bisthiomethyl alkene intermediates which were accessible by McMurry coupling or Wittig olefination of partially fluorinated naphthalene precursors. DFT&#8208;based electronic structure calculations, near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy, and UV/Vis measurements were used for HOMO/LUMO gap determination and to analyze the electronic structures of the partially fluorinated DNTTs. Reduced exciton binding was observed in thin films.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Isoriccardin C through a C&#8722;H Activated Heck Type Macrocyclization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral sulfinyl auxiliary group in ortho&#8208;position of a biaryl axis is directing in the adjacent aryl moiety an atropo&#8208;diastereoselective ortho&#8217;&#8208;Fujiwara&#8208;Moritani Heck coupling with dynamic kinetic resolution and can finally be transformed into a hydroxyl function of a natural occurring cyclophane type bisbibenzyl.







Abstract
Macrocyclization is typically the key step in syntheses of cyclophane&#8208;type natural products. Considering compounds with axially chiral biaryl moieties, the control of atroposelectivity is essential for biological activity and is synthetically challenging. Herein we report on atroposelective macrocyclization involving an oxidative Heck type process and enabling the first atropo&#8208;enantiopure synthesis of isoriccardin C. A chiral sulfinyl auxiliary in the ortho&#8208;position of a biaryl axis (still flexible) was used to induce a C&#8722;H activated atropodiastereoselective oxidative Heck coupling (&gt;98&#8201;% de). The traceless character of the sulfinyl auxiliary enables the introduction of a hydroxy group to give the target molecule with &gt;98&#8201;% ee as well.

         <title>The Asymmetric Difluoro&#8208;Reformatsky Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structural motif of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;substituted carboxyl and carbonyl groups with hydroxy&#8208; or amino&#8208;substituents at the stereogenic carbon in &#946;&#8208;position is found frequently in drugs and biologically active compounds. A straightforward method for obtaining those targets in high enantiomeric purity is given by asymmetric difluoro&#8208;Reformatsky and imino&#8208;difluoro&#8208;Reformatsky reactions that lead to &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;amino&#8208;carboxylates or &#946;&#8208;lactams. Three concepts that open a route to this type of compounds are discussed here. Firstly, chiral substrates are able to induce stereoselectivity in the formation of the newly created stereogenic center. Secondly, covalently bound and removable chiral auxiliaries are used in asymmetric syntheses and, thirdly, chiral additives and ligands at the metal direct the addition of the zinc enolate, the Reformatsky reagent, to aldehydes or imines in an enantioselective manner. The review closes with a short discussion of more recently developed difluoro&#8208;aldol reactions that may be considered as alternatives to the Reformatsky procedure.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Liquid Crystalline Self&#8208;Assembly of Concave Diindoles with a Hydropentalene Core</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fischer indole reaction of Weiss diketone with 4&#8208;bromophenylhydrazine provided the 2,8&#8208;dibromo&#8208;hexahydropentaleno[2,1&#8208;  b  :5,4&#8208;  b&#8217;  ]diindole key intermediate, which was converted to the target compounds by  N  &#8208;protection/Suzuki cross coupling. Variation of protecting groups, mesogenic units, and their alkyloxy substitution gave calamitic diindole mesogens. Both  N  &#8208;protection and alkyloxy chain influenced the mesomorphic properties of phenyl diindoles. Among the differently  N  &#8208;protected derivatives only ethylcarbamate&#8208;protected ones formed enantiotropic mesophases. Mesophase range and type were controlled by the chain lengths: chains &#8804; C12 gave nematic (N) phases, diindoles with side chains &#8805; C14 formed additional lower temperature smectic (SmA) phases. Irrespective of the chain lengths 4'&#8208;alkyloxybiphenyl diindoles formed N and SmA phases upon first heating, but tended to decomposition below their clearing points. X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis of bis(4'&#8208;decyloxy)biphenyl diindole reveals that in the solid state the folding angle of the hydropentalene core caused an almost perpendicular orientation of the two indole/biphenyl parts with respect to each other.</dc:description>

         <title>Use of Perylene Diimides in Synthetic Photochemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perylene diimides are a relevant class of organic dyes with excellent optoelectronic features. Therefore, they found application as photocatalysts for important organic transformations. This Minireview highlights the recent advances within this field, with a specific focus on the mechanism of these photochemical reactions. Finally, still unsolved challenges and forward&#8208;looking opportunities are mentioned here.







Abstract
Perylene diimides (PDIs) are valuable organic chromophores that stand out for their outstanding optical and redox properties. Owing to these features, PDIs have emerged as prominent dyes capable of acting as photocatalysts for numerous relevant organic transformations. This Minireview highlights the recent advances in the application of PDIs in organic photocatalysis. The various mechanistic pathways of the photo&#8208;reduction reaction of aryl halides, recently proposed in independent studies, are discussed with an eye to unsolved challenges and forward&#8208;looking opportunities regarding the use of PDIs within this field.

         <title>Two&#8208;Step Protocol for Iodotrimethylsilane&#8208;Mediated Deoxy&#8208;Functionalization of Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step protocol for iodotrimethylsilane&#8208;mediated deoxy&#8208;functionalization of primary and secondary alcohols was described. This protocol involves iodination of alcohol and then replaced by a N, S, or O nucleophile. Compared with traditional Mitsunobu reaction, non&#8208;acidic pre&#8208;nucleophiles can be used in this protocol and configuration of alcohols can be retained.







Abstract
We have developed a two&#8208;step protocol for iodotrimethylsilane&#8208;mediated deoxy&#8208;functionalization of primary and secondary alcohols to afford products containing a C&#8722;N, C&#8722;S, or C&#8722;O bond. In the first step the alcohol undergoes iodination with iodotrimethylsilane, and in the second, the iodine atom is replaced by a N, S, or O nucleophile. Compared with traditional Mitsunobu reaction, non&#8208;acidic pre&#8208;nucleophiles can be used, and the reaction proceeds with retention of configuration. This operationally simple, highly efficient protocol can be used for some natural products and small&#8208;molecule drugs containing hydroxy&#8208;group.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arsenic&#8208;bridged silafluorene and germafluorene were synthesized as a novel class of mixed&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;bridged heterofluorenes. Their structures, photophysical properties, and electronic natures were studied by experimental and computational means. The doubly&#8208;bridged biphenyl moieties were distorted from the reported singly&#8208;bridged ones. The intersystem crossing from the singlet excitation states to the triplet ones was enhanced by the arsenic&#8208;bridging structures, implying that bridging through an arsenic atom is favorable for phosphorescence.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The equilibrium acidity scale (pKa  scale) in acetonitrile has been supplemented by numerous new compounds and new &#916;pKa  measurements. It now contains altogether 231 acids &#8211; over twice more than published previously &#8211; linked by 566 &#916;pKa  measurements and spans between the pKa  values of hydrogen iodide (2.8) and indole (32.57), covering close to 30 orders of magnitude. Measurement results acquired over the last 15 years were added to the scale and new least squares treatment was carried out. The treatment yielded revised pKa  values for the compounds published previously, with the root mean square difference between revised and previous values 0.04, demonstrating very good stability of the scale.
Correlation equations were developed for estimating pKa  values for the studied types of compounds in water, DMSO, DMF and 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane on the basis of pKa  values in acetonitrile. These equations enable predicting pKa  values with an average error around or less than 1 pKa  unit, which is a sufficient accuracy for many applications.
The scale is expected to be a useful tool for the widest possible research areas in organic chemistry, electrochemical power sources, catalysis, etc.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Reaction of N,N&#8208;Dimethylanilines with N&#8208;Substituted Maleimides Utilizing Benzaldehyde as the Photoinitiator</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzaldehyde can be employed as the photoinitiator for the introduction of a low&#8208;cost, simple, photochemical protocol for the reaction between N&#8208;substituted maleimides with N,N&#8208;dialkylanilines.







Abstract
Photoorganocatalysis constitutes a powerful domain of photochemistry and organic synthesis. The scaffold of pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]quinolinoles exhibits interesting and potent inhibition against various enzymes, making them really promising pharmaceutical targets. Herein, we describe a photochemical methodology for the reaction of N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines with N&#8208;substituted maleimides, utilizing benzaldehyde as the photoinitiator. A variety of substituted N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines and N&#8208;substituted maleimides were converted into the corresponding adducts in moderate to high yields.

         <title>Synthesis of Natural Compounds Based on the [3,7]&#8208;Diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (Bispidine) Core</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [3,7]&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (bispidine) structure is found in several interesting naturally occurring alkaloids as the tetracyclic alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;sparteine and the tricyclic (&#8722;)&#8208;cytisine alkaloids. In this review, we describe the most relevant strategies for the synthesis of molecules.







Abstract
The [3,7]&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (bispidine) structure is found in several interesting naturally occurring alkaloids. The most representative components are the tetracyclic alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;sparteine and the tricyclic (&#8722;)&#8208;cytisine alkaloids. Their biological activities have been known for a long time. In the literature, different syntheses of both tetracyclic and tricyclic structures have been reported, especially in the last few years, when a number of new reports renewed the interest in these fascinating molecules. Bicyclic bispidine derivatives have been thoroughly investigated in recent times also for their applications as catalysts, metal chelating agents, and lately in coordination polymers chemistry. In this review, we describe the most relevant strategies for the synthesis of molecules based on the [3,7]&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core, related to (&#8722;)&#8208;sparteine and (&#8722;)&#8208;cytisine alkaloids.

         <title>Controlling &#947;&#8208;Peptide Helicity with Stereoselective Fluorination</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Do the twist: C&#8722;F bonds have been incorporated, with stereocontrol, onto the backbone of a &#947;&#8208;hexapeptide. The presence of fluorine either stabilizes or disrupts the helical conformation, depending on the stereochemical configuration. Fluorine also sets the &#8220;handedness&#8221; of the helix.







Abstract
Peptides that are composed of backbone&#8208;extended amino acids can adopt conformations resembling natural &#945;&#8208;peptidic motifs, making them promising scaffolds for biological and medicinal chemistry. In order to unlock the full potential of this class of molecules, the ability to control their secondary structures is essential. Here we show that stereoselective fluorination can be harnessed as a tool for influencing the helical character of a &#947;&#8208;hexapeptide. Fluorination is shown to either stabilize or disrupt the 9&#8208;helical conformation depending on the C&#8722;F stereochemistry, and fluorination also sets the handedness of the helix. These results provide fundamental knowledge that could expedite the future development of backbone&#8208;extended peptides for medicinal applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Alkyl Bridged&#8208;Tris&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Amino Acids as C3&#8208;Symmetric and Linear Linkers</title>

         <dc:description>Although bis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids have been used to synthesize dimer models of aggregative peptides involved in neurodegenerative diseases, tris&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids are employed to a lesser extent for trimer models. The reported tris&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids substituted on the 1,3,5&#8208;positions of an aromatic ring are not suitable for mimicking trimers due to their low flexibility and high planarity. Here, we design and synthesize two new alkyl bridged&#8208;tris&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids with Fmoc protecting groups as new flexible linkers for trimer models.</dc:description>

         <title>Formal semisynthesis of demethylgorgosterol utilizing a stereoselective intermolecular cyclopropanation reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study we report a convenient and high yielding formal semisynthesis of demethylgorgosterol, a marine steroid with an intriguing sidechain containing a cyclopropane unit. This was achieved through the synthesis of an advanced ketone intermediate. The synthetic route features a total of ten steps, starting from commercially available stigmasterol, with an overall yield of 27%. The key step was a stereoselective intermolecular cyclopropanation. This reaction proceeded in 82% yield, the resulting cyclopropane carboxylic ester shows a trans/cis ratio of 89:11, with a diastereomeric ratio for the trans&#8208;diastereomers of &gt;99:1. A reduction/oxidation sequence afforded the corresponding aldehyde, which was used in a Grignard reaction. A final oxidation step then yielded the desired ketone. This novel route presents a platform to further investigate the medicinal applications of gorgosterol&#8208;type steroids and to fully understand their role in coral symbiosis.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Matsuda&#8208;Heck reaction, usually performed with palladium catalysts, can be carried out under transition metal free conditions in the presence of a KOtBu / DMF couple. This system allows, under mild conditions (20 &#176;C), the selective and direct synthesis of stilbenes from aryldiazonium salts. Mechanistic studies suggest a radical pathway in which the DMF acts as the initiator of the overall process.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Cis  &#8208;  N  &#8208;phenyl&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;2  H  &#8208;benzo[  d  ][1,3]oxazin&#8208;2&#8208;imines and cis&#8208;  N  &#8208;phenyl&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;2  H  &#8208;benzo[  d  ][1,3]thiazin&#8208;2&#8208;imines were prepared and subjected to Flash Vacuum Pyrolysis (FVP). NH&#8208; and NCH  3  &#8208; oxazines reacted at lower temperatures than the thio&#8208; analogs, showing lower thermal stability, while NCH  2  Ph&#8208; compounds presented the opposite behavior. Oxazines and thiazines yielded different products through homolytic fragmentations of the heterocycle moiety, the stability of which increased with the N&#8208;substitution. Based on the analysis of the reaction temperatures and the unraveling of the obtained products, it is proposed that any heterocyclic ring&#8208;opening reactions (initiated by X3&#8208;C4, C8a&#8208;N1, or C2&#8208;X3 bond rupture) require less energy than the retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder process (RDA) that yields butadiene. This concerted reaction path is only achieved at temperatures higher than 470&#186;C. Kinetic measurements reveal negative entropies of activation, which suggest a partially concerted way of reaction or slightly asynchronous fragmentation processes, with higher energy of activation (Ea) values for the N&#8208;substituted derivatives compared to the unsubstituted ones. Experimental results agree with calculations at the DFT level (B3LYP/6&#8208;311+G(d,p)) and M06&#8208;2X (6&#8208;311+G(d,p))&#160; from Gaussian09 software.</dc:description>

         <title>Updating the CSIC Reaction (2003&#8211;2020)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mini review describes the progress and developments of the CSIC [Carbanion&#8208;mediated Sulfonate (Sulfonamide) Intermolecular Coupling (or Intramolecular Cyclization)] reaction over the past 17&#8197;years, since 2003, when the first thematic review on the CSIC reaction was published.







Abstract
Herein, we have updated the progress and developments of the Carbanion&#8208;mediated Sulfonate (or Sulfonamide) Intermolecular Coupling, and Intramolecular Cyclization, abbreviated as CSIC reaction (CSICr), in the last seventeen years from the seminal review published in 2003 in this same Journal. CSICr has proven to be a useful and versatile synthetic tool, efficiently providing a number of open&#8208;chain [alkane(sulfonamide)sulfonates] or cylic (sultams and sultones) synthetic intermediates or final products of high value in organic and medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Non&#8208;Canonical Reactivity of Gold Carbene with Alkyne: An Overview of the Mechanistic Premise</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of gold carbene with alkyne have been discussed with the emphasis on the possible mechanisms, while also focusing on the energetics of the key intermediates as studied in some of the crucial reports covered herein.







Abstract
The unique nature of gold carbene and its synchronous counterpart gold&#8208;stabilized carbocation, is mainly responsible for the non&#8208;canonical reactivity profile that it demonstrates in comparison to any other transition metal carbene. Being an important subset to this class, reactions of gold carbene with alkyne sponsor products far more diverse than cyclopropenation as canonically expected in case of other transition metal carbenes. These gold&#8208;catalyzed reactions have largely been proposed to follow either a [1,n]&#8208;carbene transfer process or an alternate pathway involving a direct interception of the &#946;&#8208;gold vinyl cation with a nucleophile at the cationic carbon. Despite of a clear distinction in structure, bonding and energy of a vinyl gold carbene and &#946;&#8208;gold vinyl cation; they have been found to exhibit identical reactivities like cyclopropenation, C(sp2)&#8211;H insertion, etc. making it extremely difficult to &#8220;experimentally&#8221; investigate and validate a mechanistic pathway. It is because of lack of conclusive experimental evidence, in addition to the limited number of detailed computational studies, that multiple pathways have been proposed simultaneously to rationalize the product formation. As an effort to shed light on the mechanisms of these reactions, herein, documentation of these reactions with a focus on their mechanistic premise has been presented.

         <title>Oxidative Transformation of Biomass into Formic Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formic acid is receiving attention as a promising hydrogen source as well as a valuable chemical for the industries of textiles, pharmaceuticals etc. This minireview is focused on the recent advancement in its formation from biomass, using oxidative pathways and different catalysts such as polyoxometalate, vanadium oxide, hydrothermal, and photocatalysis, developed over the past ten years.







Abstract
Formic acid (FA) is well&#8208;known as a promising hydrogen source as well as a valuable chemical for the industries of textiles, pharmaceuticals etc. In fact, 1.137&#8197;million&#8197;metric&#8197;tons of FA is required worldwide per year to meet the current demand. Therefore, there is a strong interest for the generation of FA in a sustainable way to meet the future demand. Inspired by this information, several strategies have been considered for the sustainable synthesis of FA. Herein, we summarise the recent articles for the oxidative transformation of biomass into FA.

         <title>Synthesis and Determination of Absolute Configuration of Zealexin A1, a Sesquiterpenoid Phytoalexin from Zea mays</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective synthesis of zealexin A1, a macrocarpane&#8208;type sesquiterpene phytoalexin is described. Our methodology for the total synthesis involved the stereoselective construction of the stereogenic center via enzymatic resolution followed by Johnson&#8211;Claisen rearrangement. The absolute configuration of the natural product was determined by GC analyses of the synthetic and natural zealexin A1 methyl esters.

         <title>The Riveting Chemistry of Poly&#8208;aza&#8208;heterocycles Employing Microwave Technique: A Decade Review</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present review discloses microwave&#8208;assisted chemistry of five/six&#8208;member poly&#8208;aza&#8208;heterocycles namely, triazole, tetrazole, triazine, and tetrazine. The emphasis has been made towards the advantages of microwave conditions over conventional process. The review unveils the latest synthetic approaches and potential applications originated from these heterocycles.







Abstract
The application of microwave technique in chemical laboratory rooted back in 1986 and found advantageous over conventional approaches. On the other side, poly&#8208;aza&#8208;heterocycles are influencing organic frameworks with a fascinating chemistry and well explored by employing microwave&#8208;assisted organic reactions. In the present review, we have thoroughly updated rousing literatures of microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis and reactions of various poly&#8208;aza&#8208;heterocycles viz., triazole, tetrazole, triazine, and tetrazine from the past decade (2010&#8211;2020). The expedient chemistry and enabling role of microwave heating for adequate chemical transformations of such heterocycles, which were more challenging using classical approaches, are appropriately elucidated. This review also highlights the potential applications of these heterocyclic scaffolds and their derivatives in different scientific domains. Remarkably, such chemical architects possess wide applications as crucial building blocks in synthesis of biologically relevant compounds, agrochemicals, and compounds of interest in material science.

         <title>Klyflaccilins B&#8208;T, Polyoxgenated Eunicellins from the Soft Coral Klyxum flaccidum</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nineteen new eunicellin diterpenoids named klyflaccilins B&#8208;T were isolated from the gorgonian Klyxum flaccidum. The structures were elucidated by NMR, showing that they represent different eunicellin subclasses. For five compounds X&#8208;ray crystal structures were obtained that allowed to determine their absolute configurations.

         <title>Chemistry for the Identification of Therapeutic Targets: Recent Advances and Future Directions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The earliest preclinical stages of drug discovery must generate information about the identity, the in&#8197;vivo engagement, and the endogenous levels of the targeted protein(s). In this review, we outline the main strategies by which chemical probes, compounds that rely on chemical reactions to give an answer to specific biological questions, are contributing to currently challenging biomedical applications.







Abstract
The increasing availability of chemical probes for specific applications in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry is extensively facilitating our knowledge of biological systems. This understanding has fundamental implications in the development of new efficacious therapeutic strategies. Nowadays, successful drug discovery programs consider identification, engagement, and endogenous levels of the intended therapeutic target from the earliest preclinical stages. All these aspects are addressed with the use of chemical probes, compounds that rely on the use of a particular chemical reaction to give an answer to a specific biological question. In this review we will describe the underlying chemistry and the most recent advances experienced in the field together with their most important biomedical applications.

         <dc:description>The synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;  epi  &#8208;jungianol was successfully carried out by the gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed propargyl Claisen rearrangement/hydroarylation cascade reaction of suitably substituted propargyl vinyl ethers as the key step to form the indane skeleton. Two routes were compared, which involved substrates with a different degree of substitution on the vinyl moiety. The one based on a propargyl vinyl ether bearing an unsubstituted vinyl moiety, despite entailing two additional steps, provided the final compound in a higher overall yield. A method for the preparation of acid sensitive propargyl vinyl ethers with an &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;substituted vinyl moiety and their reactivity under gold catalysis is also reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of&#160;&#947;&#8208;Spirolactams by Birch Reduction of Arenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A convenient method for the synthesis&#160;of&#160;&#947;&#8208;spirolactams in only three steps is described. Birch reduction of inexpensive and commercially available aromatic carboxylic acids in the presence of chloroacetonitrile affords nitriles in moderate to good yields. Suitable precursors are methyl&#8208;substituted benzoic acids, naphthoic, and anthroic acid. Subsequent catalytic hydrogenation proceeds smoothly with PtO2&#160;or Raney Ni as catalysts and lactams are isolated in excellent yields and stereoselectivities. Thus, up to 3 new stereogenic centers can be constructed as sole diastereomers from achiral benzoic acids. Furthermore, it is possible to control the degree of saturation at different pressures, affording products with 0, 1, or 2 double bonds. Overall, more&#160;than 15 new&#160;&#947;&#8208;spirolactams&#160;have been synthesized in analytically pure form.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Developments in Deaminative Functionalization of Alkyl Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkyl amines could serve as alkyl radical precursors to construct C&#8722;C bonds and C&#8722;X bonds via C(sp3)&#8722;N cleavage. This review covered recent developments in the deaminative functionalization of alkyl amines.







Abstract
The amino group is one of the most prevalent functional groups present in a wide range of organic molecules, which has been widely applied in various organic synthesis and pharmaceuticals. Alkyl amines could be converted in a single step into Katritzky salts which could serve as alkyl radical precursors to construct C&#8722;C bonds and C&#8722;X bonds via C(sp3)&#8722;N cleavage. This deaminative functionalization could be carried out under transition&#8208;metal catalysis, photocatalysis, carbene catalysis or promoted by base. In this paper, recent developments in the deaminative functionalization of alkyl amines were covered. This review was categorized into four parts according to the nature of the bond formation. Some representative examples and corresponding reaction mechanisms were also summarized.

         <title>Synthesis of Enantiopure 6,11&#8208;Methylene Lipoxin B4 Methyl Ester</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible convergent enantioselective total synthesis of a rigid lipoxin B4 analog incorporating a 6, 11&#8208;methylene bridge has been developed. C1&#8211;C12 aldehyde and C13&#8211;C20 ketophosphonate underwent highly efficient key Horner olefination. A final six&#8208;step sequence delivered the target compound displaying all stereogenic centers with standard lipoxin B4 configurations.







Abstract
The synthesis of Lipoxin B4 analogs (LXB4) to gain access to stabilized inflammation resolving compounds is an actual field of research. Focusing on variation and stabilization of the conjugated E,Z,E,E C6&#8211;C13 tetraene moiety of natural LXB4, a methylene bridge introduced between C6 and C11 suppresses any Z/E isomerization of the C8&#8211;C9 olefin. Intending to enable prospective structure variations in connection with the C1&#8211;C5 and C14&#8211;C20 fragments, a convergent total synthesis has been developed. Optically active C1&#8211;C12 building blocks were build&#8208;up from cycloheptatriene 1&#8208;carbonester (C6&#8211;C11, C21) and glutaryl chloride (C1&#8211;C5) using Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type acylation and chiral HPLC. The C13&#8211;C20 segment had been generated via a five&#8208;step sequence starting from heptanoyl chloride. Horner key olefination enabled the assembly of the carbon backbone. A final five&#8208;step sequence including a chelate Cram reduction of the unsaturated ketone moiety afforded the target 6,11&#8208;methylene LXB4 methyl ester.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Sulfonylureas</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfonylureas are extensively used as hypoglycemic drugs, plant growth regulators or herbicides, and as promising drugs to treat inflammatory diseases. The different protocols for the synthesis of sulfonylurea derivatives have been grouped into two main classes according to the N&#8722;C or N&#8242;&#8722;C carbonyl chemical bonds of the urea moiety selected to be formed in the salient synthesis step.







Abstract
Sulfonylureas are employed in a variety of applications including use as drugs to treat type II diabetes and as plant growth regulators or herbicides. Traditionally, the synthesis of sulfonylureas has been accomplished either by the treatment of sulfamides with isocyanates in the presence of a base or through sulfonamides conversion into N&#8208;sulfonyl isocyanates or N&#8208;sulfonyl carbamate derivatives which provide the corresponding sulfonylureas upon treatment with amines. Both approaches are severely limited by the weak nucleophilicity of sulfamides and by the difficulty in synthesizing and handling isocyanate species. Such a drawback could be mitigated by the emergence of protocols establishing the labile electrophilic functional groups in&#8197;situ so that their coupling with nucleophilic partners takes place in one&#8208;pot. Recently, the development of environmentally friendly methods to prepare sulfonylurea containing compounds without using harmful reagents has attracted considerable attention. The aim of the minireview is to explore the different protocols emerged in the literature to generate sulfonylureas giving importance to the reaction mechanisms of crucial synthetic steps.

The different protocols for the synthesis of sulfonylurea derivatives have been grouped into two main classes according to the N&#8722;C or N&#8242;&#8722;C carbonyl chemical bonds of the urea moiety selected to be formed in the salient synthesis step.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfonylureas are employed in a variety of applications including use as drugs to treat type II diabetes and as plant growth regulators or herbicides. Traditionally, the synthesis of sulfonylureas has been accomplished either by the treatment of sulfamides with isocyanates in the presence of a base or through sulfonamides conversion into &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;sulfonyl isocyanates or &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;sulfonyl carbamate derivatives which provide the corresponding sulfonylureas upon treatment with amines. Both approaches are severely limited by the weak nucleophilicity of sulfamides and by the difficulty in synthesizing and handling isocyanate species. Such a drawback could be mitigated by the emergence of protocols establishing the labile electrophilic functional groups &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; so that their coupling with nucleophilic partners takes place in one&#8208;pot. Recently, the development of environmentally friendly methods to prepare sulfonylurea containing compounds without using harmful reagents has attracted considerable attention. The aim of the minireview is to explore the different protocols emerged in the literature to generate sulfonylureas giving importance to the reaction mechanisms of crucial synthetic steps.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Evaluation of &#945;&#8208;(Hydroxymethyl)cycloalkanols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;(Hydroxymethyl)cycloalkanol derivatives are raising increasing interest due to their robustness and their biological and chemical applications. This review takes an overview of the literature for the occurrence and synthesis of such derivatives, concentrating on advances in the last two decades.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;(Hydroxymethyl)cycloalkanols are pervasive structural scaffolds found in natural products and synthetic intermediates with varied biochemical and physicochemical properties. These profiles have driven numerous research groups to the synthesis of such motifs using innovative methodologies. The presence of vicinal diols attached to a cycloalkane makes from these motifs excellent synthetic intermediates for the synthesis of diverse ring systems.

         <title>C(sp2)&#8722;Si Bond Functionalization through Intramolecular Activation by Alkoxides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview covers recent progress in the functionalization of C(sp2)&#8722;Si bonds by intramolecular activation by alkoxides. Such processes involve the formation of a cyclic hypervalent silicon intermediate that allows carbon&#8208;to&#8208;oxygen migration of the organosilyl group and thus the formation of a carbanionic species poised to undergo electrophilic substitution. The C(sp2)&#8722;Si bond cleavage can be &#8220;endocyclic&#8221; (Brook rearrangement) or &#8220;exocyclic&#8221;.







Abstract
Organosilicon reagents are invaluable tools in the hands of the modern chemist that allow accomplishing a number of synthetically useful transformations. While some are standard reactions, others are more complex transformations, such as the Brook rearrangement and its variants. This carbon&#8208;to&#8208;oxygen silyl migration represents a privileged method to generate transient carbanionic species well suited to undergo functionalization upon electrophilic substitution in the presence of an electrophile. This minireview focuses on recent advances in C(sp2)&#8722;Si bond functionalization through intramolecular activation by alkoxides. The key elements of reactivity will be highlighted in the introduction to allow the proper understanding of the migration process. Then, an overview of the reactivity of substrates incorporating the C(sp2)&#8722;Si motif and their synthetic applications will be provided.

         <title>Trimodular solution phase protocol for rapid large&#8208;scale synthesis of hydrogen bond surrogate&#8208;constrained &#945;&#8208;helicomimics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Scalability, optimal reagent usage, high yields, easy isolation and cost&#8208;effectiveness, are key for the applicability of synthetic methodologies in production of potential therapeutics. Hydrogen bond surrogate (HBS) constrained &#945;&#8208;helical peptides (&#945;&#8208;helicomimics) have shown promise as therapeutics based on their efficiency to interfere with protein&#8208;biomolecular interactions. The propyl HBS&#8208;constrained &#945;&#8208;helicomimics have shown highest helicities in both single turn and extended, &#945;&#8208;helices (ST&#945;H, E&#945;H). Here we present a solution phase synthetic (SPS) method, for the rapid, large scale, low cost synthesis of libraries of ST&#945;H and E&#945;H in high yields. The key to the efficiency is our trimodular (M  1  , M  2  , M  3  ) synthetic protocol where M  1  is a library of HBS&#8208;linked peptidomimetic synthons of both ST&#945;H and E&#945;H; M  2  and M  3  are desired oligopeptide libraries. Advantages of the trimodular method over conventional unimodular methods are demonstrated through synthesis of large&#8208;scale libraries of M  1  , ST&#945;H and E&#945;H.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Vistas of Trivalent Nitrogen Compound Reduction by Samarium Diiodide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The affinity of Samarium(II) to coordinate with trivalent nitrogen leads to a pre&#8208;association complex prior to the electron transfer. This pre&#8208;association turns out to be extremely effective in terms of enhancing the rate of reduction of substrates with trivalent nitrogen in rather unprecedented mechanistic pathway. This minireview describes these intriguing findings.







Abstract
In trivalent nitrogen compounds, the nitrogen lone pair is highly amenable to bind to samarium iodide prior to electron transfer. As SmI2 is more azaphilic than oxophilic, its affinity to the nitrogen lone pair is more pronounced in aza substrates than in the analogous carbonyl compounds. The impact of this binding is very large in terms of reaction rate and at the same time gives rise to unique mechanistic phenomena, which include unusual kinetic rate orders, catalysis by quantum dots, and remote functionalization. Even reduction of nitriles was found to be affected by this coordination to SmI2. This review focuses on the reduction mechanisms of three groups of compounds: imines, azobenzene, and nitriles.

         <title>Recent Developments in C&#8722;H functionalisation of Benzofurans and Benzothiophenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we summarise progress in benzofuran and benzothiophene C&#8722;H functionalisations over the past five years, including 1) alkylations, 2) arylations and heteroarylations, 3) carboxylations, carbamoylations and C&#8208;heteroatom bond formations and 4) cyclisations.







Abstract
Benzofurans and benzothiophenes are important pharmaceutical motifs, appearing in a broad range of small molecule therapeutic classes. Often overlooked by synthetic methodologists in favour reactions of the analogous indole bicyclic system, there is nevertheless a plurality of approaches to effecting benzofuran and benzothiophene C&#8722;H functionalisations. In this review, we summarise progress in this area over the past five years, including 1) alkylations, 2) arylations and heteroarylations, 3) carboxylations, carbamoylations, and C&#8208;heteroatom bond formations and 4) cyclisations.

         <title>An Insight into Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions on the Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane Scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of bridgehead substitutions on non&#8208;covalent interactions was investigated for seven BCP derivatives. The X&#8208;ray analyses show 3D&#8208;structures and a combination of non&#8208;covalent interactions including HB, XB, and CH&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;HC contacts. QTAIM analysis and MEP graphs show the presence of bond critical points and &#963;&#8208;holes.







Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) is studied extensively as a bioisosteric component of drugs. Not found in nature, this molecular unit approximates the distance of a para&#8208;disubstituted benzene which is replaced in medicines as a method of improving treatments. Predicting interactions of these drugs with specific active sites requires knowledge of the non&#8208;covalent interactions engaged by this subunit.

The presence of 3D BCP units prevented the &#960;&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;&#960; stacking between phenyl rings in 3, 4, and 7. The BCP skeleton was often rotationally averaged, indicating fewer interactions compared to bridgehead functional groups. Using DFT analysis, geometries were optimized and molecular electrostatic potentials were calculated on the BCP surfaces. These interaction profiles may be useful for designing BCP analogs of drugs.

     alt="An Insight into Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions on the Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane Scaffold"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of bridgehead substitutions on non&#8208;covalent interactions was investigated for seven BCP derivatives. The X&#8208;ray analyses show 3D&#8208;structures and a combination of non&#8208;covalent interactions including HB, XB, and CH&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;HC contacts. QTAIM analysis and MEP graphs show the presence of bond critical points and &#963;&#8208;holes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) is studied extensively as a bioisosteric component of drugs. Not found in nature, this molecular unit approximates the distance of a &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;disubstituted benzene which is replaced in medicines as a method of improving treatments. Predicting interactions of these drugs with specific active sites requires knowledge of the non&#8208;covalent interactions engaged by this subunit. Structure determinations and computational analysis (Hirshfeld analysis, 2D fingerprint plots, DFT) of seven BCP derivatives chosen to probe specific and directional interactions. X&#8208;ray analysis revealed the presence of various non&#8208;covalent interactions including I&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;I, I&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;N, N&#8722;H&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;O, C&#8722;H&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;O, and H&#8722;C&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;H&#8722;C contacts. The preference of halogen bonding (I&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;I or I&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;N) in BCP &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; strictly depends upon the electronic nature and angle between bridgehead substituents.

         <title>Reaction of N,N&#8208;Disubstituted Polyfluoroalkanethioamides with Diazomethane: Entry to New Thiirane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4&#8208;dioxane derivatives are discussed.






New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between N,N&#8208;disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

  Multigram synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates relying on efficient 4&#8211;5&#8208;step reaction sequences is described. The title compounds was obtained in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield).
  
  
  
  
 
 
  An approach to the synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates on a multigram scale was developed. Two synthetic strategies were evaluated: the first based on the lithiation&#8211;borylation of the corresponding 2&#8208;bromoallyl derivatives, and the other relying on regioselective hydroboration of the appropriate hetera&#8208;substituted enynes. The second method appeared to be more efficient in terms of scalability and substrate scope. Further steps included ring closing&#8208;metathesis, mild palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation with diazomethane, and reaction with KHF2 and furnished the title compounds in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield, 4&#8211;5 steps).

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;Sultams by One&#8208;Pot Reductive Cyclization of Cyanoalkylsulfonyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
  A multigram synthesis of spirocyclic &#947;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;sultams is reported, which are advanced building blocks for organic synthesis and drug discovery. The synthesis proceeds through a one&#8208;pot reductive cyclization of cyclic cyano sulfonyl fluorides.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  One&#8208;pot intramolecular cyclization of novel sp3&#8208;enriched cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluorides into spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;sultams is disclosed. The method relies on nitrile group reduction followed by sulfonylation of amino group thus formed upon mild conditions (NaBH4, NiCl2&#183;6H2O in MeOH). Cyclization proceeds smoothly with considerable efficiency (48&#8211;84&#8201;%, 10 examples) on up to 30 g scale. The cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluoride intermediates can be obtained via S&#8208;nucleophilic substitution in &#946;&#8208;functionalized alkanenitriles or double alkylation of &#945;&#8208;alkylthioacetonitrile, followed by oxidative chlorination with Cl2 and further reaction with KHF2. The title mono&#8208; and bifunctional sultams are advanced sp3&#8208;enriched building blocks for drug discovery and organic synthesis providing novel substitution patterns and frameworks mimicking saturated nitrogen heterocycles such as pyrrolidine/pyrrolidone.

The cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluoride intermediates can be obtained via S&#8208;nucleophilic substitution in &#946;&#8208;functionalized alkanenitriles or double alkylation of &#945;&#8208;alkylthioacetonitrile, followed by oxidative chlorination with Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and further reaction with KHF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The title mono&#8208; and bifunctional sultams are advanced sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;enriched building blocks for drug discovery and organic synthesis providing novel substitution patterns and frameworks mimicking saturated nitrogen heterocycles such as pyrrolidine/pyrrolidone.&lt;/p&gt;
