         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Vicinal Chiral Carbonyl Bioisosteres</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic asymmetric strategies for constructing vicinal &#945;&#8208;chiral carbonyl bioisosteres are summarized, covering difluoromethylene, gem&#8208;difluoroalkene, and oxetane motifs. The review highlights recent advances in transition&#8208;metal and organocatalysis, mechanistic insights into stereocontrol, and prospects for bioisostere&#8208;driven drug discovery.

The strategic incorporation of &#945;&#8208;chiral centers into carbonyl bioisosteres is a powerful approach for improving the physicochemical and pharmacological profiles of drug candidates. This review summarizes recent advances in the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of vicinal chiral carbonyl bioisosteres, focusing on difluoromethylene, gem&#8208;difluoroalkene, and oxetane motifs. We highlight transition&#8208;metal and organocatalyzed methodologies that achieve high stereocontrol and broad functional group tolerance. Representative examples are analyzed to illustrate key mechanistic pathways, stereochemical models, and applications in late&#8208;stage functionalization. While significant progress has been made, we also discuss persistent challenges regarding generality, efficiency, and mechanistic understanding. Finally, we outline future research directions to guide the rational design of catalytic systems and novel molecular scaffolds, thereby accelerating the discovery of high&#8208;performance pharmaceuticals based on chiral bioisosteres.

We report a Rh(II)&#8208;catalyzed double [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] benzannulation of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyrromethanes using a versatile rhodium&#8208;enalcarbenoid that functions as a 4[C] synthon. This strategy provides direct access to biologically important 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(indolyl)methanes in excellent yields. The scalability and applicability of the method are demonstrated through a Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and the construction of core structures relevant to therapeutic agents.

Herein, we report a Rh(II)&#8208;catalyzed double [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] benzannulation of diazoenals with 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyrromethanes, providing direct access to biologically relevant 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(indolyl)methanes. The transformation proceeds through an in&#8201;situ generated Rh&#8208;enalcarbenoid intermediate that serves as a 4[C] synthon, enabling regioselective C2&#8208;functionalization of the pyrrole ring followed by intramolecular cyclization. This strategy represents the first example of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(indolyl)methanes synthesis that does not rely on indole precursors. By exploiting the unique reactivity of Rh&#8208;enalcarbenoids, this methodology expands the synthetic toolbox for constructing indole&#8208;based heterocyclic frameworks with potential applications in medicinal chemistry. The synthetic importance of double [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] benzannulation has been demonstrated by the one&#8208;step synthesis of the biologically relevant 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(indolyl)methane scaffold.

         <title>A2A Adenosine Receptor Agonists With Last&#8208;Step Enzymatic 18F&#8208;Labelling Potential (Fluorinase) for Positron Emission Tomography (PET)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study exploits the comparable binding tolerances between the fluorinase enzyme and the A2A adenosine receptor towards the development of novel C&#8208;2 functionalised 5&#8242;&#8208;fluorodeoxy&#8208;adenosine (FDA)&#8208;based agonists with enzymatic 18F&#8208;labelling capability for positron emission tomography (PET).

New agonists of the A2A receptor are reported with 18F&#8208;labelling potential for positron emission tomography (PET). These were designed by exploiting common binding interactions of substrates for the fluorinase and agonists of the human A2A adenosine receptor. Target compounds were structurally inspired by the selective A2A receptor agonist CGS21680. The new agonists were synthesised and their affinities for the human A2A receptor evaluated through radioligand displacement assays. 18F&#8208;Labelled analogues of the new agonists for potential PET radiotracer applications are now accessible through last&#8208;step radiosynthesis using the fluorinase enzyme and [18F]fluoride.

         <title>The Activation of the Precatalyst Au&#8211;Cl Bond in the Cycloisomerization of Propargylamides: The Role of Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>


Herein we describe our findings dealing with the activation of the Au&#8211;Cl bond in [Au(L)Cl] complexes with several additives. We have probed several additives for their ability to promote the activation of the Au&#8211;Cl bond, in a prototypical cationic Au(I)&#8208;mediated reaction, namely the cyclization/cycloisomerization of propargylamides. Phenol was found to be an efficient additive, successfully promoting the activation of the gold precatalysts, and the progression of the reaction, under mild conditions. Further studies on the reactivity of several substrates and the kinetic profile of the reaction provide valuable insight to the phenol&#8208;mediated activation of Au&#8211;Cl bond and its catalytic competence. Density functional theory calculations provided additional details regarding the effect of the studied additives.

         <title>Ring Formation in Sesquiterpene Synthesis: Biomimetic vs. Non&#8208;Biomimetic Strategies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A short review of cyclase enzyme&#8208;mediated ring formation in sesquiterpene biosynthesis is presented as a prelude to six case studies examining the merits and demerits of biomimetic vs. non&#8208;biomimetic strategies for carbocyclisation in the total synthesis of this iconic natural product class.

Biomimetic synthesis refers to organic synthesis using strategies that mimic biosynthetic pathways to prepare natural products. It draws inspiration from nature's efficiency in constructing organic compounds, often enabling mild conditions and efficient routes. Natural products constitute an enduring source of leads for drug discovery, and this approach has been used to successfully synthesise many medicinally important compounds. The prevalence of topologically complex carbocyclic ring systems in many secondary metabolites and particularly terpenes makes their preparation challenging and highlights the need for increased synthetic efficiency in carbocyclisation reactions. Here, we briefly review recent advances in our understanding of sesquiterpene cyclases and then present six case studies comparing biomimetic vs. non&#8208;biomimetic approaches to the key ring&#8208;forming reactions in this context. Examples have been selected to exemplify some of the classic ring systems that characterise this iconic natural product family.

         <title>Photocatalysis 1,6&#8208;Addition for Site&#8208;Selective Alkylation of para&#8208;Quinone Methides (p&#8208;QMs) via Amidyl Radical 1,2&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>

         <dc:description>
A mild photocatalytic protocol synthesizes diverse diarylmethane derivatives (39 examples, good yields) via 1,2&#8208;HAT of N&#8208;benzoyloxyamides generating carbon radicals, followed by selective coupling with para&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs).

Under light irradiation, a novel photocatalytic reaction between para&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) and N&#8208;benzoyloxyamides has been developed to synthesize substituted diarylmethane derivatives, which exhibit potential biological activities. This reaction proceeds under mild conditions, affording 39 compounds with good yields and broad substrate applicability. Mechanistic studies reveal that N&#8208;benzoyloxyamides undergo 1,2&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (1,2&#8208;HAT) to generate carbon&#8208;centered radicals, which subsequently undergo selective radical&#8211;radical coupling with p&#8208;QMs to form the diarylmethane framework.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Dihydropyranones through Cyclization and Organometallic Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 48, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable method for synthesizing 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydropyran&#8208;2&#8208;ones (MeO&#8208;DHP&#8208;2&#8208;ones) via base&#8208;promoted cyclization of hydroxy alkynes is presented. Mechanistic and computational studies guided the transformation into 4,5&#8208;dihydropyran&#8208;4&#8208;ones (DHP&#8208;4&#8208;ones), enabling access to spiroacetal precursors relevant to natural product synthesis.

Dihydropyranones are key structural motifs in biologically active polyketides. We report a reproducible and scalable method for synthesizing 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydropyran&#8208;2&#8208;ones (MeO&#8208;DHP&#8208;2&#8208;ones) via base&#8208;promoted cyclization of hydroxy alkynes. Mechanistic and computational studies revealed that water content and reaction time critically influence lactonization efficiency. Two optimized protocols &#8211; using potassium carbonate (K2CO3) or in situ generated sodium methoxide (MeONa) &#8211; enabled consistent yields across multiple substrates. Cyclization in deuterated methanol provided deuterium&#8208;enriched DHP&#8208;2&#8208;one scaffolds with high isotopic incorporation, valuable for mechanistic and medicinal applications. The transformation of DHP&#8208;2&#8208;ones into 4,5&#8208;dihydropyran&#8208;4&#8208;ones (DHP&#8208;4&#8208;ones) was achieved via organometallic addition followed by a tailored workup involving aqueous hydrochloric acid and boron trifluoride diethyl etherate (BF3&#183;OEt2). This protocol proved robust and scalable, compatible with both organolithium and organomagnesium reagents, although the latter afforded lower yields. Mechanistic analysis highlighted key steps including hemiacetal formation, oxonium activation, and controlled hydrolysis. The methodology enables multigram&#8208;scale preparation of both DHP&#8208;2&#8208;one and DHP&#8208;4&#8208;one scaffolds and provides a streamlined route toward spiroacetal precursors.

         <dc:description>
A new and effective method for synthesizing C3&#8208;arylated imidazopyridines from 2&#8208;amino pyridines via a two&#8208;step reaction involving nucleophilic substitution, internal imine formation, and aromatization has been developed. This catalyst and solvent&#8208;free method provides a practical advantage of broad substrate scope and good to excellent yields.

A convenient new synthetic strategy was discovered for the synthesis of C3&#8208;arylated imidazopyridines through alkylation of benzyl bromides with 2&#8208;aminopyridines and base&#8208;mediated condensation with diethyl oxalate. A series of C3&#8208;arylated imidazopyridines was obtained in moderate to good yield. This protocol has the advantages of a mild reaction condition, broad substrate scope, and the absence of catalyst or additives.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Polysubstituted Tetrahydrofurans/Tetrahydropyrans via Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Desulfurative Tandem Cyclization Between Thiols and 1,6&#8208;Enynes</title>

A metal&#8208;free, visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoredox&#8208;catalyzed tandem cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes 1 with thiols 2 has been developed. This process efficiently produces polysubstituted tetrahydrofurans 3 and tetrahydropyrans 5 in good yields with excellent regioselectivity via a desulfurative/cyclization/hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) cascade.

We have developed a metal&#8208;free, visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoredox&#8208;catalyzed tandem cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes 1 with thiols 2, enabling the efficient synthesis of polysubstituted tetrahydrofurans 3 in good to excellent yields with high regioselectivity. This transformation proceeds via a desulfurative/cyclization/hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) cascade. Notably, when 1,6&#8208;enynes 4 featuring a phenyl group at the terminal alkene position are employed as substrates, the reaction shifts to afford six&#8208;membered tetrahydropyran derivatives 5, demonstrating excellent substrate&#8208;controlled regioselectivity. This metal&#8208;free protocol exhibits broad functional group tolerance, a wide substrate scope, and high bond&#8208;forming efficiency, while remaining amenable to gram&#8208;scale synthesis.

This metal-free protocol exhibits broad functional group tolerance, a wide substrate scope, and high bond-forming efficiency, while remaining amenable to gram-scale synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modular Assembly of Cyclic Sulfones via Radical Annulation with Unactivated Olefins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 48, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modular assembly of cyclic sulfones was achieved with structurally diverse sulfonylmethyl bromides and unactivated olefins under photoredox conditions. A radical relay mechanism was proposed according to detailed mechanistic studies, with function of additives, including diisopropylethylamine and sodium iodide, fully addressed. The products could be transformed into various bioactive compounds, including three representative drug&#8208;like molecules.

Cyclic sulfones have been recognized as valuable motifs in drug discovery, serving as conformational constraints, hydrogen&#8208;bonding acceptors and electron&#8208;withdrawing functionalities. Synthetic routes such as sulfide oxidation and intramolecular cyclization involving SO2 typically require preconstructed starting materials, limiting structural diversity. Moreover, intermolecular cyclizations toward cyclic sulfones using readily available reagents such as olefins remain scarce, and divergent and modular approaches have yet to be established. Here we report direct and tunable synthesis of cyclic sulfones from radical annulation with a broad range of unactivated olefins and sulfonylmethyl bromides via photoredox catalysis. Mechanistic studies indicate that the transformation proceeds through a radical relay cyclization process initiated by addition of highly electrophilic sulfonylmethyl radical to olefins. The utility of this method is further demonstrated through concise synthesis of three bioactive molecules bearing essential cyclic sulfone architectures.

An efficient base&#8208;mediated intramolecular cyclization of (3&#8208;(acetylphenoxy)prop&#8208;1&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzaldehydes affords fused benzo[b]naphthooxepine derivatives is developed. Further, this protocol provides a great opportunity for the preparation of various benzo[b]naphthooxepine in good yields.

An efficient base&#8208;promoted synthetic approach has been developed for the synthesis of benzo[b]naphthooxepinones from (3&#8208;(acetylphenoxy)prop&#8208;1&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzaldehydes. The transformation proceeds via a base&#8208;mediated 7&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization, followed by intramolecular aldol condensation and subsequent dehydration, resulting in the formation of a fused tricyclic ring system. This one&#8208;pot protocol affords a series of benzo[b]naphthooxepinone derivatives in moderate to good yields, offering a concise and environmentally benign route to these polycyclic scaffolds.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature C(sp2)&#63743;N Bond Formation Using Pd, Cu, and Ni Catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 48, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article presents the conceptual and perspective summaries on Pd, Cu, and Ni metal&#8208;mediated C&#8211;N bond formation, which will be beneficial for future organic chemists to emphasize room temperature C(sp2)&#8211;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions to improve process economy, safety, and environmental friendliness. It also elaborates on the development of transition metal catalysis for these cross couplings, from its early reports in 1983 to the most recent advancements up to 2025. Furthermore, it highlights the synthetic and biological applications of this field.

Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8211;N cross&#8208;coupling is a vital strategy in organic synthesis, enabling the efficient formation of N&#8208;aryl amines as key intermediates in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and biologically active molecules. Precise control of reaction temperature is critical, as it significantly influences both product yield and the formation of byproducts. Conducting C(sp2)&#8211;N cross&#8208;coupling at room temperature offers notable advantages, including cost&#8208;effectiveness, enhanced safety, and reduced environmental impact. This review summarizes literature from 1983 to 2025, highlighting transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8211;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions and primarily involving palladium, copper, and nickel catalysts performed under mild, room&#8208;temperature conditions. The review underscores the broad utility of these reactions across medicinal, agricultural, and industrial domains.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis and Applications of Thiocarbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 48, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines synthetic strategies for preparation of thiocarbonyl derivatives, including thioketones, thioamides, thioesters, dithiocarbamates, and isothiocyanates, through both catalytic and noncatalytic methods. It emphasizes their importance in the synthesis of biologically active drug compounds and natural products.

In recent years, thiocarbonyl compounds containing carbon&#8211;sulfur double&#8208;bond organic compounds (C&#63742;S) possess unique structural and electronic properties that differentiate them from the well&#8208;studied carbonyl compounds (C&#63742;O). Their polarized C&#63742;S bond enhances their reactivity toward electrophiles and nucleophiles, making them valuable synthetic intermediates in organic transformations. These thiocarbonyl compounds readily participate in cycloaddition chemistry, radical, substitution, elimination, and addition reactions and serve as versatile building blocks in preparing various sulfur&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds. The thiocarbonyl functional group is formed from carbonyl compounds through the use of phosphorus pentasulfide (P2S5 and dimer P4S10), H2S, and the most common reagent, i.e, Lawesson's reagent. They find medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry applications where thiocarbonyl compounds exhibit various biological activities. Over the years, they have been explored as antiviral, anticancer, antibacterial, and antituberculosis agents and as treatments for hyperthyroidism. This article discusses recent developments in modern synthesis (2019&#8211;2025), reactivity, stability, and bio and material science applications of thiocarbonyl compounds, highlighting their increasing significance in sustainable chemistry and the development of novel therapeutics and novel optical materials.

         <title>Study of Uncatalyzed and Micellar&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Degradation of Amoxicillin by Colloidal MnO2: Experimental Optimization and Mechanistic Aspects</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The absorption spectra of amoxicillin degradation by colloidal MnO2 in the presence and absence of surfactants.

Herein, the oxidative degradation of amoxicillin (AMX) by water&#8208;soluble colloidal MnO2 is investigated spectrophotometrically at 298&#8201;K in both uncatalyzed and nonionic micellar&#8208;catalyzed media (Triton X&#8208;100 and Brij&#8208;35). A 1:1 stoichiometric ratio between AMX and MnO2 in acidic medium is observed, and two primary oxidation products are identified and characterized by gas chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry analysis. The reaction exhibits first&#8208;order kinetics with respect to the concentration of AMX in aqueous media, and a fractional&#8208;order dependence in micellar media. Similarly, first&#8208;order and fractional&#8208;order dependences are observed with respect to the concentrations of MnO2 and H2SO4, respectively, in both phases. The effects of experimental parameters, including ionic strength, dielectric constant, and the concentrations of Mn(II), KBr, KCl, and Na2SO4, are thoroughly investigated. Significant catalytic effects are observed for the nonionic surfactants Triton X&#8208;100 and Brij&#8208;35, which are explained using an appropriate mathematical model. A reaction mechanism and corresponding rate law consistent with the experimental data are proposed for both uncatalyzed and micellar&#8208;catalyzed systems, and the thermodynamic activation parameters are evaluated using the Arrhenius equation.

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of Indole&#8208;Based C&#8211;N Axially Chiral Triarylmethanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein report the synthesis of C&#8211;N axially chiral and N, N&#8208;disubstituted 2&#8208;aminoindole&#8208;based triarylmethanes via a 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition of tosyliminoindoles to p&#8208;quinone methides (PQMs), followed by in situ N&#8208;protection. These triarylmethanes display remarkable C&#8211;N configurational stability, with rotational barriers ranging from 27.5 to 40.9&#8201;kcal/mol, as calculated using density functional theory (DFT) and corroborated by experimental data. The 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition proceeds efficiently in DMF at room temperature in the absence of any base or catalyst. The resulting adducts undergo smooth N&#8208;protection via alkylation, acylation, or sulfonylation under mild basic conditions. This strategy offers convenient access to a structurally diverse library of aminoindole and di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenol&#8208;derived triarylmethanes, exhibiting C&#8211;N atropisomerism, in good to excellent yields.

The exceptional C&#8211;N configurational stability, with rotational barriers in the range 27.5&#8211;40.9&#8201;kcal/mol, exhibited by these triarylmethanes, is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and corroborated by experimental evidence.

         <title>Electrochemical C(sp2)&#8208;H Diphosphorylation With a Redox Mediator: Access to Gem&#8208;Bisphosphonates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot electrosynthesis of geminal bisphosphonates from acridine or xanthene is described.

A one&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot method for the preparation of dihydroacridine bisphosphonates at room temperature by Fc/Fc+&#8208;mediated electrochemical synthesis using (RO)3P (R=alkyl) and acridines in good yields at room temperature is proposed. This is the first example of twofold C&#8211;P formation via synchronous aromatic C&#8211;H phosphorylation. 9,10&#8208;Dihydroacridine derivatives are commonly found as privileged structural motifs in OLEDs, bioactive substances, photocatalysts, and various materials for useful applications. However, synthesis of these compounds from starting materials usually involves multiple stages. To date, no examples have been reported of the formation of geminal bisphosphonates on a single carbon atom through the phosphorylation of a C(sp2)&#8211;H aromatic fragment. The proposed method is also applicable for xanthene and acridine orange derivatives, but the yields of the bisphosphonates are lower. The products were characterized using X&#8208;ray crystallography. Their redox properties were determined through cyclic voltammetry. Paramagnetic compounds formed under oxidation conditions were analyzed using the electron paramagnetic resonance method.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis, Optical, and Photoluminescent Properties of Pyrrolonaphthalimides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;catalyzed transformations of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;iodonaphthalimide with terminal alkynes were investigated as a facile one&#8208;pot approach to the synthesis of pyrrolonaphthalimides. In this protocol, the cross&#8208;coupling reaction and cyclization were used as a single process. Substituents in the pyrrole ring influence the optical and photoluminescent properties of pyrrolonaphthalimides.

The concise one&#8208;pot synthesis of pyrrolonaphthalimides from 3&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;iodonaphthalimide and terminal alkynes has been developed. Copper&#8208;catalyzed transformation of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;iodonaphthalimide with alkynes proceeds via the formation of an alkyne substrate, which then undergoes 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization to pyrrolonaphthalimides. The approach demonstrates good tolerance for functional groups. The bathochromic shift of the absorption maximum of the UV&#8211;vis spectrum of the solution of pyrrolo&#8208;NIs in toluene achieved 76&#8201;nm for the pyrrolo&#8208;NI containing 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)phenyl moieties. The highest photoluminescence quantum yield (78%) in toluene is observed for the phenyl&#8208;substituted pyrrolo&#8208;NI.

         <title>Synthesis and Application of [18F]Togni Reagent I: An Electrophilic 18F&#8208;Labeled Trifluoromethylating Reagent for Positron Emission Tomography Tracer Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Togni reagent I, one of the most used electrophilic trifluoromethylating reagents, has been radiolabeled with fluorine&#8208;18 starting from the widely available fluoro&#8208;benziodoxole and the [18F]Ruppert&#8211;Prakash reagent. To demonstrate the broad potential for late&#8208;stage functionalization, aliphatic carboxylic acids were successfully converted into their 18F&#8208;trifluoromethylated analogs via metallaphotoredox catalysis.

The trifluoromethyl (CF3) group is a ubiquitous motif in drug discovery campaigns due to its ability to markedly improve the ADME properties of small molecules while maintaining potency. The isotopologue labeling of CF3&#8208;bearing drugs with fluorine&#8208;18 has gained attention for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. However, their radiolabeling via conventional 18F&#8208;trifluoromethylation methods relies almost completely on nucleophilic and radical [18F]CF3&#8208;reagents, whereas there remains no general means to incorporate a formal [18F]CF3+ into PET tracer candidates. Herein, we disclose the realization of a novel electrophilic 18F&#8208;labeled trifluoromethylating reagent based on the family of 10&#8208;&#955;&#8208;3 hypervalent iodines: [18F]Togni reagent I. The method uses nucleophilic ligand substitution at iodine by the [18F]Ruppert&#8211;Prakash reagent, providing [18F]Togni reagent I in a radiochemical yield of 4.3&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.8% and a molar activity of 15&#8201;&#177;&#8201;9.6&#8201;GBq/&#956;mol. Initial studies on the utility of this reagent demonstrate the direct, late&#8208;stage formation of C(sp3)&#8722;[18F]CF3 bonds via metallaphotoredox&#8208;mediated conversion of naturally abundant carboxylic acids. Hence, this work illustrates the potential of the novel electrophilic [18F]CF3&#8208;reagent as a complementary approach leading to valuable 18F&#8208;trifluoromethylated architectures in PET tracer development.

     alt="Synthesis and Application of [18F]Togni Reagent I: An Electrophilic 18F-Labeled Trifluoromethylating Reagent for Positron Emission Tomography Tracer Synthesis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Togni reagent I, one of the most used electrophilic trifluoromethylating reagents, has been radiolabeled with fluorine-18 starting from the widely available fluoro-benziodoxole and the [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]Ruppert&#8211;Prakash reagent. To demonstrate the broad potential for late-stage functionalization, aliphatic carboxylic acids were successfully converted into their &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-trifluoromethylated analogs via metallaphotoredox catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trifluoromethyl (CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) group is a ubiquitous motif in drug discovery campaigns due to its ability to markedly improve the ADME properties of small molecules while maintaining potency. The isotopologue labeling of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-bearing drugs with fluorine-18 has gained attention for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. However, their radiolabeling via conventional &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-trifluoromethylation methods relies almost completely on nucleophilic and radical [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-reagents, whereas there remains no general means to incorporate a formal [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

         <dc:description>
We have developed a photoinduced synthesis of difluoromethyl compounds using a combined method of fluoride&#8208;coupled electron transfer and hydrogen atom transfer. Utilizing benzimidazoline derivatives as photoreductant and hydrogen atom donor, difluoromethylarenes were synthesized through the C&#8211;F bond reduction of trifluoromethylarenes.

The difluoromethyl group is a bioisostere of hydroxy and sulfanyl groups. The photocatalytic reduction of trifluoromethyl groups is one of the most important methods for the synthesis of difluoromethyl compounds. We have developed a photoinduced synthesis of difluoromethyl compounds using a combined method of fluoride&#8208;coupled electron transfer and hydrogen atom transfer. Utilizing benzimidazoline derivatives as photoreductant and hydrogen atom donor, difluoromethylarenes were synthesized through the C&#8211;F bond reduction of trifluoromethylarenes. Mechanistic studies indicated that the photoreduction proceeded via an electron&#8208;donor&#8211;acceptor complex between trifluoromethylarenes and benzimidazoline derivatives.

Rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation/annulation of glycal derivatives with alkynes enables the efficient synthesis of pyridone&#8208; and pyranone&#8208;fused sugar frameworks. The reactions proceed smoothly under mild conditions and tolerate a variety of amide and carboxylic acid substrates, providing a versatile platform for the construction of complex carbohydrate&#8208;based heterocycles.

Rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation/annulation reactions of glycal derivatives with alkynes have been developed, providing an efficient approach to structurally diverse pyridone&#8208; and pyranone&#8208;fused sugar frameworks. The catalytic system of [Cp*RhCl2]2/Ag2CO3 in 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane effectively promoted the annulation to give the pyridone&#8208;fused product. The methodology was applicable to a wide range of glycal&#8208;derived primary and secondary amides as well as carboxylic acids, affording the corresponding annulated sugars in moderate to excellent yields. Remarkably, the carboxylic acid&#8208;based annulation proceeded under mild conditions (40&#176;C&#8211;80&#176;C) to give pyranone&#8208;fused derivatives in high yields. The annulated products underwent smooth acidic deprotection to furnish the corresponding triols without decomposition, demonstrating the robustness of the fused heterocyclic frameworks.

A TFA&#8208;catalyzed reaction of 9&#8208;fluorene propargylic alcohol with 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls as nucleophiles resulted in functionalized conjugated diene&#8208;dione&#8208;appended and propargyl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl derivatives of fluorenone. In contrast, the reaction under Lewis acid conditions afforded an unusual spirocyclic product, and a plausible mechanism is provided. The scope and synthetic utility of the products have also been investigated.

The scope and synthetic utility of the synthesized products by reduction and base&#8208;promoted cyclization have also been investigated. Spectroscopic data and single&#8208;crystal XRD of the compounds have been utilized to determine the structure of the products.

&#960;&#8208;Expanded Nitrogen&#8208;Cation (N+)&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons: A Review of Intramolecular Cyclization Routes to Benzo[c]Quinolizinium, Triazinium, Pyridoquinazolinium, and Pyridoquinoxalinium Frameworks</title>

         <dc:description>
This review surveys recent progress in the synthesis of extended aromatic quinolizinium derivatives via intramolecular SNAr and oxidative 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization. Conventional thermal approaches are discussed alongside emerging, sustainable activation methods such as electrosynthesis and photochemical processes. Particular attention is given to the mechanistic influence of leaving groups and substituents, as well as current limitations and opportunities to broaden the synthetic scope.

In this review, we explore recent advancements in synthesizingextended aromatic quinoliziniumderivatives via intramolecular aromatic nucleophilic substitution (SNAr) or oxidative 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization mechanisms. We first explore their historical synthesis through standard thermal activation and then focus on their synthesis using more efficient and greener activation methods, such as electrosynthesis or photochemical processes. We compare the efficiency of these methods and rationalize through a mechanistic point of view how the choice of leaving groups and substituents on the aromatic backbone affects synthesis outcomes and reaction scope. Finally, we give an overview of the readily accessible quinolizinium skeletons prepared through this intramolecular reaction and explore the current challenges that remain to be addressed to expand their synthetic toolbox.

         <title>Copper(II)&#8208;Catalyzed One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Thiazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;imines and Formamides Using Vilsmeier Reagent</title>

         <dc:description>
Cross&#8208;linked chitosan&#8208;supported copper(II) biocomposite (CS&#8208;PDB@Cu(NO3)2) catalyzed one&#8208;pot&#8208;two&#8208;step synthesis of thiazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;imines via N&#8208;aryl propargylamine intermediates and conversion of N&#8208;aryl propargylamines to formamides using Vilsmeier reagent.

Facile synthetic routes for the conversion of a series of N&#8208;aryl propargylamines to thiazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;imines and formamides are described. A cross&#8208;linked chitosan&#8208;supported copper(II) biocomposite (CS&#8208;PDB@Cu(NO3)2) was employed as a heterogeneous catalyst in a one&#8208;pot multicomponent reaction involving primary amines, formaldehyde, terminal alkynes, and isothiocyanates in toluene, yielding thiazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;imines in moderate to good yields (25%&#8211;70%) via N&#8208;aryl propargylamine intermediates. Additionally, N&#8208;formylation of N&#8208;aryl propargylamines using the Vilsmeier reagent afforded formamides in high yields (70%&#8211;88%). A total of 20 thiazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;imine derivatives and 22 formamide derivatives were successfully isolated. All isolated products were characterized by 1H and 13C {1H} NMR and HRMS spectroscopy. The CS&#8208;PDB@Cu(NO3)2 biocomposite catalyst was recyclable for up to three catalytic cycles through simple filtration. Reaction intermediates for both transformations were identified by LC&#8208;MS analysis. Furthermore, the structures of two thiazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;imine compounds, 4h and 4t, were unambiguously confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography.

         <dc:description>
Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation of indoles directed by (benzo)imidazole enables an efficient [4+2] cyclization with maleimides, allows rapid access to C6&#8208;fused indole polyheterocyclic compounds. This oxidant free protocol offers wide substrate scope with good functinal group tolerance.

We report the first rhodium (III)&#8208;catalyzed, (benz)imidazole&#8208;directed site&#8208; selective [4+2] cyclization of indoles with maleimides, enabling the efficient synthesis of C6&#8208;fused polyheterocyclic indoles. This strategy features with wide substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. Mechanistic insights were gained through control experiments, deuterium&#8208;labeling, and competitive studies. Application of this methodology produced novel heterocycles via simple postsynthetic chemical transformations, showcasing the synthetic utility of this approach.

         <title>Intra&#8208; and Intermolecular Glycosylation of d&#8208;Idopyranosyl and 6&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosyl Donors: Toward the Repeating Unit of Campylobacter jejuni HS:4c Capsular Polysaccharide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive glycosylation study of diversely protected and activated d&#8208;idopyranosyl and 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosyl donors using intra&#8208; and intermolecular coupling strategies is reported. Intramolecular aglycon delivery afforded 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#946;&#8208;idopyranosides, while intermolecular glycosylation yielded chromatographically separable &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;linked disaccharides, the latter corresponding to the repeating unit of Campylobacter jejuni HS:4c capsular polysaccharide.

The synthesis of disaccharide mimics of Campylobacter jejuni HS:4c capsular polysaccharide, a major pathogen associated with campylobacteriosis, is challenged by the presence of a 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#946;&#8208;linked 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranoside. Herein, the development of a synthetic route to orthogonally protected d&#8208;ido&#8208;hexo&#8208; and 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosyl donors is reported bearing diverse anomeric leaving groups, which represents, to the best of knowledge, the second direct access to 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosides from ido&#8208;configured precursors. These donors were evaluated in intramolecular aglycon delivery (IAD) and intermolecular glycosylation protocols. While IAD enabled complete &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity with hexosyl donors, it failed with the heptosyl analog. Intermolecular glycosylation provided mixtures of anomers, but the use of a 7&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;protected heptosyl donor allowed access to the disaccharide in good yield, with chromatographic separation of the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;anomers. Structural analysis revealed unexpected conformational behavior, with the &#945;&#8208;disaccharide adopting the 1C4 chair conformation. This work establishes a foundation for the synthesis of C. jejuni HS:4c disaccharides and represents a step toward well&#8208;defined sugar&#8208;based vaccines candidates against campylobacteriosis.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Redox Cycloisomerization/[3+2] Dipolar Cycloaddition Domino Reactions: Construction of Isoxazolidine&#8208;Containing Polycyclic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alkyne oxidation/[3+2] cycloaddition domino reaction containing nitro groups and alkyne&#8208;tethered cyclohexadienones, employing gold catalyst, furnishes a diverse array of complex isoxazolidine&#8208;containing polycyclic scaffolds in moderate to good yields, with up to excellent diastereoselectivities. The domino process features simple operation, step economy, and atom economy.

Herein, we described an efficient gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed redox cycloisomerization/[3+2] dipolar cycloaddition domino reaction of o&#8208;(alkynyl)nitrobenzenes. The domino process involves the in situ generation of &#945;&#8208;oxo gold carbenes via intramolecular redox reactions of alkynes and nitro functional groups, followed by the formation of nitrones and subsequent intramolecular [3+2] dipolar cycloaddition reaction to furnish a diverse array of complex isoxazolidine&#8208;containing polycyclic scaffolds in moderate to good yields, with up to excellent diastereoselectivities.

         <title>Synthesis of Naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]oxepines Through an HFIP&#8208;Promoted Peri&#8208;Selective Arene&#8211;Epoxide Cyclization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient two&#8208;step strategy for the synthesis of naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]oxepines was developed via peri&#8208;selective intramolecular epoxide&#8208;opening of C1&#8208;tethered naphthalene epoxides. Regioselectivity was achieved through steric blocking at C2, and the method was demonstrated to be mild, scalable, and extendable to the diastereoselective synthesis of tetrahydrooxepino[4,3,2&#8208;cd]indoles.

&lt;p&gt;An efficient two-step strategy for the synthesis of naphtho[1,8-&lt;i&gt;bc&lt;/i&gt;]oxepines was developed via &lt;i&gt;peri&lt;/i&gt;-selective intramolecular epoxide-opening of C1-tethered naphthalene epoxides. Regioselectivity was achieved through steric blocking at C2, and the method was demonstrated to be mild, scalable, and extendable to the diastereoselective synthesis of tetrahydrooxepino[4,3,2-&lt;i&gt;cd&lt;/i&gt;]indoles.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Practical Synthesis of Elacestrant, an FDA&#8208;Approved Selective Estrogen Receptor Degrader</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core skeleton of elacestrant was synthesized by one&#8208;pot conversion of 6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;tetralone into a cyclic olefin, followed by copper&#8208;catalyzed cyclic olefin arylation. Two different strategies were established for the transformation of this intermediate into the target compound: reductive amination of an aldehyde and nucleophilic substitution of a bromo compound with the core skeleton.

Herein, we report an efficient and scalable synthesis of the core skeleton of elacestrant, a selective estrogen receptor degrader used in breast cancer treatment. The present synthesis features simple synthetic transformations, involving one&#8208;pot conversion of 6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;tetralone into a cyclic olefin followed by copper&#8208;catalyzed arylation of the cyclic olefin (iodometathesis) with a diaryliodonium salt as a key strategy to achieve the core skeleton on a gram scale. This procedure was extended to the total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;elacestrant by employing two different coupling strategies: reductive amination of an aldehyde and nucleophilic substitution of a bromo compound with the core skeleton.

         <title>Symmetrical Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine Dimers as Novel Organic Light Emitters: Bidirectional Synthesis and Photoluminescence Characterization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine dimers are synthesized via a bidirectional strategy and characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The key substitution position for tuning optical properties is identified. Photophysical studies, supported by density functional theory calculations, show fluorescence in the 490&#8211;580&#8201;nm range, with the most planar system exhibiting the highest quantum yield (&#8804;47%) in solution, indicating optoelectronic potential.

A series of novel substituted biimidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives are synthesized via a robust three&#8208;step, bidirectional approach. The strategy involves an initial Negishi homocoupling of bromopicolinonitrile, followed by the formation of diketones with aryl Grignard reagents, and concludes with a double cyclization using substituted arylamines to afford a library of biimidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines. Selected dimers are structurally characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. In addition, the impact of substitution patterns and connectivity within the biimidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine framework on their photoluminescent properties is systematically investigated. The key substitution position on imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine core for tuning optical properties is identified. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are conducted to complement the experimental findings, offering a deeper understanding of the electronic structure, planarity, highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital properties that influence their performance as organic light&#8208;emitting materials for optoelectronic applications.

Synthesis of 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinoline&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylates&#8212;promising chemotypes for drug discovery&#8212;by one&#8208;pot condensation of 2&#8208;(3&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;3&#8208;oxoprop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzoic acids and various primary amines is described. The reaction mechanism likely involves intra&#8208; or intermolecular Michael addition, followed by recyclization or lactamization, respectively.

As a part of the ongoing COVID Moonshot project, an expedient approach to 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinoline&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylates is described. The method is based on a one&#8208;pot tandem Michael amination&#8211;lactamization sequence starting from 2&#8208;(3&#8208;alkoxymethoxy&#8208;3&#8208;oxoprop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzoic acids and primary amines. The scope of the N&#8208;nucleophiles included various aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroaromatic primary amines. The reaction tolerated and was compatible with ether, ester, amide, alcohol, carbamate, free alcohol, azole, or azine moieties. The developed protocol allowed for the preparation of target tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives in 40%&#8211;75% yield on up to 109&#8201;g scale (later extended up to 0.86&#8201;kg). A mechanistic scheme involving a ring&#8208;chain tautomerism for the electrophilic component of the reaction is proposed. The method was used in the synthesis of DNDI&#8208;6510, a SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease inhibitor that showed promising results obtained in preclinical studies.

&lt;p&gt;Synthesis of 1-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-4-carboxylates&#8212;promising chemotypes for drug discovery&#8212;by one-pot condensation of 2-(3-alkoxy-3-oxoprop-1-en-2-yl)benzoic acids and various primary amines is described. The reaction mechanism likely involves intra- or intermolecular Michael addition, followed by recyclization or lactamization, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a part of the ongoing COVID Moonshot project, an expedient approach to 1-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-4-carboxylates is described. The method is based on a one-pot tandem Michael amination&#8211;lactamization sequence starting from 2-(3-alkoxymethoxy-3-oxoprop-1-en-2-yl)benzoic acids and primary amines. The scope of the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-nucleophiles included various aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroaromatic primary amines. The reaction tolerated and was compatible with ether, ester, amide, alcohol, carbamate, free alcohol, azole, or azine moieties. The developed protocol allowed for the preparation of target tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives in 40%&#8211;75% yield on up to 109&#8201;g scale (later extended up to 0.86&#8201;kg). A mechanistic scheme involving a ring-chain tautomerism for the electrophilic component of the reaction is proposed. The method was used in the synthesis of DNDI-6510, a SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor that showed promising results obtained in preclinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Synthesis of Aryl Difluoroalkyl Ethers by Deprotonative Functionalization of the Difluoromethoxy (&#63743;OCHF2) Moiety</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Difluoromethoxyarenes were functionalized by deprotonation/electrophilic trapping of the OCF2H group. The inherent instability of the intermediate fluorinated carbanion was tamed by masking with a silyl group under in&#8201;situ trapping conditions. The sensitive silyl derivative could be transformed without isolation by a 2nd in&#8201;situ trapping under the action of fluoride, yielding valuable aryl difluoroalkyl ethers.

An unprecedented deprotonative functionalization of difluoromethoxylated compounds is described herein using a lithiated base under in&#8201;situ trapping conditions. Aryl &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroalkyl ethers could be obtained in a two&#8208;step process via difluoro(trimethylsilyl)methylated compounds without any intermediate purification. These new silylated scaffolds act as intermediates to mask the highly unstable difluorinated carbanion and to limit the formation of fluorocarbenes. Desilylative trapping with various electrophiles using a fluoride source gave rise to a library of new &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated ethers, which could be of particular interest in various fields such as life sciences or materials chemistry.

         <dc:description>
A sustainable, metal&#8208;free [3&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition of N&#8208;phenacylbenzothiazolium salts with alkylidene acenaphthylenones and barbiturate&#8208;derived alkenes provides efficient access to N,S&#8208;polyheterocycles. This atom&#8208;economical strategy constructs spirocyclic cycloadducts bearing multiple stereocenters in a single step, achieving high yields and diastereoselectivity, avoiding tedious purification steps, and offering potential in medicinal and materials applications.

A highly efficient, metal&#8208;free, atom&#8208;economical green protocol for the synthesis of N,S&#8208;polyheterocycles via dearomative [3&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition of N&#8208;phenacylbenzothiazolium salts with alkylidene acenaphthylenones and barbiturate&#8208;derived alkenes. This reaction tolerates diverse substituents on the acenaphthylenone and barbiturate partners, underscoring its broad scope and providing an efficient method to construct desired cycloadducts in good to excellent yields with high diastereoselectivity. This strategy provides the formation of two C&#63743;C bonds with multiple contiguous stereocenters, including one spiro&#8208;center, in a one&#8208;pot reaction. Significantly, no hydro&#8208;quenching, solvent separations, or chromatographic/recrystallization purifications are required. Overall, this efficient, selective, and eco&#8208;friendly strategy offers rapid access to N,S&#8208;frameworks relevant to medicinal chemistry and materials science.

Asymmetric Catalytic Hydrogenation toward a Value&#8208;Added Chiral Building Block: Optically Active &#947;&#8208;Butyrolactone Scaffold from Renewable and Synthetic Derived Feedstocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This brief compendium summarizes the most successful asymmetric hydrogenation strategies for the preparation of chiral monocyclic &#947;&#8208;lactone derivatives from keto acids and keto esters, with emphasis on their relevance for large&#8208;scale production and high enatioselectivities.

This article provides a brief compendium on the production of chiral monocyclic &#947;&#8208;lactone derivatives through asymmetric hydrogenation of keto acids and keto esters using different type of catalytic approaches: homogeneous, heterogeneous as well as chemoenzymatic. Homogeneous catalysis has always been ahead with this issue, addressing the problem from different perspectives, ranging from the use of transition metal complexes (i.e., Ru, Ir, Pd, and Ni) to ligand design (mainly phosphanes) to seeking a change in the nature of the process: a) direct hydrogenation using H2 gas or b) transfer hydrogenation. This contrasts greatly with the scarce number of references found with heterogeneous catalysts, a fact that should be taken as an incentive for researchers, leaving a large field open to future research toward increasing both catalytic performance and recyclability. The integration of biocatalysis with synthetic chemistry is also an upward trend and opens up opportunities for the development of greener and more sustainable processes, due to the biogenicity/biodegradability of enzymes and to the mild reaction conditions. It is expected that continued advancements in genetic engineering and bioprocess optimization will drive further innovation and developments at a large scale, especially for stereoselective processes.

Cyclodextrin&#8208;Encapsulated N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8211;Copper(I) Complexes for Homogeneous Catalysis in Pure Water: Anaerobic Oxidation of Arylboronic Acids with Water as the Formal Oxidant</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclodextrin(CD)&#8208;encapsulated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;copper(I) complexes based on modified permethylated &#945; or &#946; CDs catalyze the ipso&#8208;hydroxylation&#8208;deborylation reaction of arylboronic acids in pure water at low copper loading. The reaction is favored by triethylamine and is compatible with various functionalized substrates. It can operate without dioxygen, with water acting as the formal oxidant.

Homogeneous copper&#8208;based systems for air&#8208;mediated oxidation of arylboronic acids in water remain scarce. Herein, it is shown that water&#8208;soluble cyclodextrin(CD)&#8208;encapsulated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8211;copper(I) complexes based on modified permethylated &#945; or &#946; CDs, catalyze the ipso&#8208;hydroxylation&#8208;deborylation reaction of arylboronic acids in pure water at low copper loading. Optimum conditions for the formation of phenols included the presence of stoichiometric triethylamine, which renders the catalytic system totally homogeneous. Although the reaction is relatively slow, it is compatible with a wide range of substrates, including substrates which are usually inert to oxidation by H2O2. The efficiency of the &#945; and &#946;&#8208;CD&#8208;based catalysts is compared, revealing a significant cavity effect on the reaction rate. The effect of the nature and position of the arylboronic acid substituents on the conversion is studied, showing a significant &#8220;ortho&#8221; effect in many cases. An experimental study of the mechanism shows that water acts as a formal oxidant and that the reaction does not requires dioxygen. These results, combined with previous knowledge of the constraints imposed by the CD cavity on metal coordination, led us to propose a copper(I)&#8208;based mechanism involving CuOH&#8208;type active species.

An innovative modular trisubstituted 1,3,5&#8208;triazine scaffold was obtained via sequential nucleophilic aromatic substitutions with amino&#8208;functionalized spacers. This robust platform is capable of accommodating distinct moieties, like a cyanine as fluorescent dye, a macrocycle as metal&#8208;chelator, and a biological vector for targeting. These results highlight the potential of this platform for developing dual&#8208;modality imaging probes.

Multifunctional platforms are essential tools in biomedical research, particularly to develop dual imaging probes that combine, for example, fluorescence imaging (FLI) and positron emission tomography (PET). We report the design of a modular trisubstituted 1,3,5&#8208;triazine scaffold synthesized from 2,4,6&#8208;trichloro&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine via sequential nucleophilic aromatic substitutions with amino&#8208;functionalized spacers. Orthogonal protecting groups enabled selective conjugation with a cyanine dye (Cy) and a DOTA chelator for FLI and PET, respectively. The third arm was functionalized with DUPA, a prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen (PSMA)&#8208;targeting pseudopeptide, via CuAAC chemistry. Despite unsuccessful attempts with Cy7 derivative (IR780), dual labeling with Cy5 and DOTA was achieved efficiently. Compound 19 exhibited optical properties comparable to commercial Cy5. These results highlight the versatility of this synthetic strategy and the potential of 19 as a dual&#8208;modality imaging agent.

Iodine(III)&#8208;Induced Cascade Annulation of &#946;&#8208;Cyanoporphyrins for the Efficient Synthesis of N&#8208;Aryliminonaphtho&#8208;Fused and N&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Carboxamide Porphyrins</title>

         <dc:description>
The cu(II)&#8208;catalyzed reaction of readily available &#946;&#8208;cyanoporphyrins and diaryliodonium salts selectively afforded N&#8208;aryliminonaphtho&#8208;fused porphyrins and N&#8208;arylcarboxamide porphyrins in good yields. The N&#8208;aryliminonaphtho&#8208;fused &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrins with bathochromic shifts displayed narrowed highest molecular orbital&#8208;lowest unoccupied molecular orbital gaps (up to 1.54&#8201;eV) and anodically shifted reduction potentials.

Meso&#8208;&#946; fused porphyrins with tunable optoelectronic properties are attractive candidates for applications in light&#8208;harvesting, sensing, and catalysis, yet their synthesis often requires harsh conditions or tedious synthetic routes. Herein, a mild, operationally simple, and Cu(OTf)2&#8208;catalyzed protocol is reported to access meso&#8208;N&#8208;aryliminonaphtho&#8208;fused and N&#8208;arylcarboxamide porphyrins from readily available &#946;&#8208;cyanoporphyrins and diaryliodonium salts. Reaction selectivity is controlled by the water content present in the reaction mixture, affording either fused imines or carboxamides in high yields. The protocol tolerates different symmetrical diaryliodonium salts and enables the preparation of free&#8208;base, Zn (II), and Cu (II) porphyrin derivatives, all fully characterized by NMR, UV&#8211;visible spectroscopy, high resolution mass spectrometry, electrochemistry, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The &#960;&#8208;extended systems exhibit distinct bathochromic shifts (&#8776;42&#8201;nm in Soret and &#8776;80&#8211;90&#8201;nm in Q&#8208;bands) and narrowed highest molecular orbital&#8208;lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO&#8208;LUMO) gaps up to 1.54&#8201;eV. Electrochemical studies reveal that fused porphyrins exhibited anodically shifted reduction potentials, while Density functional theory calculations attribute the gap reduction to LUMO stabilization and HOMO destabilization induced by fusion. Overall, this strategy provides rapid access to structurally diverse &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrins with tailored photophysical and redox properties.

         <title>Synthesis and Physicochemical Characterization of 5&#8208;Trifluoromethyl&#8208;Substituted Tetrahydrofurans and Tetrahydrothiophenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Practical multigram synthesis of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylated tetrahydrofuran and tetrahydrothiophene building blocks is reported. The corresponding alcohols, amines, and amino acid derivatives were prepared on up to decagram scale as pure diastereomers. Physicochemical profiling of the synthesized derivatives demonstrated the practical utility of the proposed chemotypes.

Fluorinated saturated heterocycles are valuable yet underexplored motifs in drug design. Here, we present a scalable strategy for the synthesis of fluorinated tetrahydrofuran (THF) and tetrahydrothiophene (THT) building blocks from simple and readily available starting materials. The optimized conditions enabled access to CF3&#8208;substituted ketones and the corresponding stereodefined alcohol, amine, and amino acid derivatives on a decagram scale. Physicochemical profiling established clear structure&#8211;property relationships. pKa and isoelectric point (pI) values were affected by strong inductive effects of heteroatoms and SO2 groups, with CF3 substitution consistently enhancing the compound's acidity and lowering isoelectric points. Lipophilicity (LogP) measurements highlighted scaffold&#8208; and substituent&#8208;dependent lipophilicity, with sulfur&#8208;containing motifs being most lipophilic and sulfone derivatives beingleast lipophilic. Overall, this work delivers a robust platform for accessing versatile fluorinated building blocks (including noncanonical amino acids) for drug discovery.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Boron&#8208;Containing Noncanonical Amino Acids With Enhanced Stability and Solubility</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new class of boron&#8208;containing noncanonical amino acids with improved aqueous solubility and stability. Structural tuning around the boron center enhances biological compatibility, and unique fluorescence properties suggest applications in protein engineering and biosensing, advancing boron&#8208;based tools for chemical biology and drug discovery.

The development of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) provides a powerful strategy to expand the chemical space of proteins beyond the natural repertoire, thereby overcoming intrinsic pharmacodynamic limitations of peptides and proteins. Among these, boron&#8208;containing ncAAs are of particular interest due to the versatile reactivity of boron and its proven therapeutic relevance in clinically approved drugs. However, poor aqueous solubility, instability under physiological conditions, and oxidative degradation have hindered their broader biological application. Here, we report the design and synthesis of a new class of boron&#8208;containing ncAAs with enhanced solubility and stability. Structural modifications around the boron center and optimized substituents were employed to improve compatibility with biological systems while retaining functional reactivity. Moreover, fluorescence analysis revealed distinct photophysical properties, indicating potential applications in protein engineering and biosensing. These results highlight the utility of cyclic boron architectures as a versatile platform for the development of boron&#8208;based amino acid analogs with broad implications in chemical biology, drug discovery, and biomolecular design.

         <title>Hoveyda&#8211;Grubbs 1st and 2nd Generation Precatalysts Modified in the Alkoxybenzylidene Part With Long (Fluorous) Chains: Catalytic Activity and Stability</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a series of light to heavy fluorous Hoveyda&#8211;Grubbs precatalyst analogs modified in the alkoxybenzylidene part in positions 2 and 5 by long (fluorinated) ponytails and tested their activity in ring&#8208;closing metathesis. The substitution mostly resulted in accelerated reaction but the precatalyst stability often decreased. Medium fluorous recycle of precatalysts and release&#8208;return mechanism were confirmed.

With the aim to understand the role of the 2&#8208;isopropoxybenzylidene ligand, we synthesized Hoveyda&#8208;Grubbs 1st and 2nd generation precatalysts (HG&#8208;I and HG&#8208;II) analogs modified in the phenyl ring with 5&#8208;octyloxy, 5&#8208;(3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,8&#8208;tridecafluorooctyloxy), 5&#8208;(2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,7&#8208;tridecafluoroheptyloxy) or 5&#8208;(2,2,4,4,5,5,7,7,7&#8208;nonafluoro&#8208;3,6&#8208;dioxaheptyloxy) ponytails and/or instead of isopropoxy group with longer decan&#8208;2&#8208;yloxy or 5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9,10,10,10&#8208;tridecafluorodecan&#8208;2&#8208;yloxy groups. To improve the fluorophilicity of the precatalysts, we further modified selected precatalysts by two or four 3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,8&#8208;tridecafluorooctyl ponytails in the NHC ligand. All modified HG&#8208;I analogs were more active than precatalyst HG&#8208;I in the ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) of diethyl allyl(methallyl)malonate (DEAMM, RCM3). On the other hand, only HG&#8208;II complexes modified with fluorinated chain in the isopropoxy group surpassed commercial HG&#8208;II precatalyst in the RCM3. In the most demanding RCM reaction of diethyl dimethallylmalonate (DEDMM, RCM4), both precatalysts modified with sec&#8208;decyloxy group initiated more quickly than HG&#8208;II, but seem to be less stable over long reaction times. Medium fluorous HG&#8208;II analogs bearing two or three polyfluorinated chains in the alkoxybenzylidene ligand were successfully tested in repeated RCM3 using medium fluorous recycle. Release&#8208;return mechanism, essential for medium fluorous recycle, was confirmed by partial exchange of the alkoxybenzylidene moieties in the recycled precatalysts using combinations of precatalysts and styrenes bearing different alkoxy groups.

&lt;p&gt;With the aim to understand the role of the 2-isopropoxybenzylidene ligand, we synthesized Hoveyda-Grubbs 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; and 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; generation precatalysts (&lt;b&gt;HG-I&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;HG-II&lt;/b&gt;) analogs modified in the phenyl ring with 5-octyloxy, 5-(3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,8-tridecafluorooctyloxy), 5-(2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,7-tridecafluoroheptyloxy) or 5-(2,2,4,4,5,5,7,7,7-nonafluoro-3,6-dioxaheptyloxy) ponytails and/or instead of isopropoxy group with longer decan-2-yloxy or 5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9,10,10,10-tridecafluorodecan-2-yloxy groups. To improve the fluorophilicity of the precatalysts, we further modified selected precatalysts by two or four 3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,8-tridecafluorooctyl ponytails in the NHC ligand. All modified &lt;b&gt;HG-I&lt;/b&gt; analogs were more active than precatalyst &lt;b&gt;HG-I&lt;/b&gt; in the ring-closing metathesis (RCM) of diethyl allyl(methallyl)malonate (&lt;b&gt;DEAMM&lt;/b&gt;, RCM3). On the other hand, only &lt;b&gt;HG-II&lt;/b&gt; complexes modified with fluorinated chain in the isopropoxy group surpassed commercial &lt;b&gt;HG-II&lt;/b&gt; precatalyst in the RCM3. In the most demanding RCM reaction of diethyl dimethallylmalonate (&lt;b&gt;DEDMM&lt;/b&gt;, RCM4), both precatalysts modified with &lt;i&gt;sec&lt;/i&gt;-decyloxy group initiated more quickly than &lt;b&gt;HG-II&lt;/b&gt;, but seem to be less stable over long reaction times. Medium fluorous &lt;b&gt;HG-II&lt;/b&gt; analogs bearing two or three polyfluorinated chains in the alkoxybenzylidene ligand were successfully tested in repeated RCM3 using medium fluorous recycle. Release-return mechanism, essential for medium fluorous recycle, was confirmed by partial exchange of the alkoxybenzylidene moieties in the recycled precatalysts using combinations of precatalysts and styrenes bearing different alkoxy groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile electrochemical method for the intramolecular aminobromination of alkenes has been developed. The method provides access to five&#8208;, six&#8208;, and seven&#8208;membered heterocycles by exploiting tetrabutylammonium bromide as an electrolyte and bromine source. The mild electrochemical generation of Br2 plausibly allows the formation of a cyclic bromonium intermediate, as supported by density functional theory calculations.

Total Synthesis of the Cyanobacterial Alkaloid Nostodione A</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of the alkaloid nostodione A is successfully achieved utilizing 3,4&#8208;dihydrocyclopenta[b]indole&#8208;1,2&#8208;dione as a key intermediate. The sensitive benzylidene moiety is introduced via a Knoevenagel condensation with p&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde. Analogs and derivatives of nostodione A are subsequently synthesized, and their antiproliferative activity is assessed.

An efficient total synthesis of the indole alkaloid nostodione A is achieved in seven steps with an overall yield of 38.6%, starting from 1,3&#8208;cyclopentanedione and 1&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzene. Construction of the novel 3,4&#8208;dihydrocyclopenta[b]indole&#8208;1,2&#8208;dione tricyclic intermediate is critical to the proposed synthesis and facilitates rapid access to the natural product. The active methylene group of the tricyclic indole intermediate is harnessed to incorporate the benzylidene moiety through a Knoevenagel condensation. The robustness and scalability of the synthesis enable the preparation of a library of nostodione analogs by merely altering the aldehyde partner. Finally, although nostodione A is classified as an inactive antiproliferative molecule according to the sulforhodamine B assay, unique novel cytotoxic molecules can be easily prepared using the nostodione A framework as an innovative template.

Cross&#8208;coupling of heteroaryl&#8208;2&#8208;boronic acids enabled by using nitro&#8208;substituted aryl halides as the coupling partner is reported. The nitro group not only boosts the reactivity of the reaction but also serves as a versatile handle for further functionalization.

Heteroaryl&#8208;2&#8208;boronic acids are challenging substrates in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction. Here, we report the efficient cross&#8208;coupling of heteroaryl&#8208;2&#8208;boronic acids enabled by using nitro&#8208;substituted aryl halides as the coupling partner under palladium catalysis. The nitro group not only boosts the reactivity of the reaction but also serves as a versatile handle for further functionalization. This method features a broad scope, excellent functional group tolerance, as well as high yields with a low catalyst loading under mild reaction conditions. The utility of the methods is demonstrated by the derivatization of the product and the efficient synthesis of pharmaceutical drug dantrolene.

         <title>BF2 Complexes of N&#8208;arylated 1&#8208;amino&#8208;anthraquinone, &#8208;xanthone, &#8208;thioxanthone, and Related Compounds: Synthesis and Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Syntheses of BF2 complexes of 1&#8208;(arylamino)anthraquinones and related compounds are developed and their properties studied.

The physical properties of anthraquinones can be modulated by the introduction of arylamino groups next to the carbonyl function. Indeed, formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond can enhance atom polarization and thus reduce their highest occupied molecular orbital&#8208;lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy gap, resulting in light absorption at longer wavelength. In this study, it successfully prepares different arylamino derivatives of anthraquinone, xanthone, and thioxanthone, compounds that are readily converted to their respective boracycles by reaction with BF3&#183;Et2O. The effect of the BF2 moiety on the electronic properties is evaluated by electrochemical and photophysical studies. These studies respectively reveal for the complexes easier reduction and red&#8208;shifted absorption wavelengths. In addition, promising 8% fluorescence quantum yield and 52% singlet oxygen quantum yield are recorded for one of the diboron&#8208;anthraquinone complexes. Representative compounds are finally tested on a panel of disease&#8208;related protein kinases.

         <title>Repurposing Aryl Boronic Acids as Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer Agents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we use aryl boronic acids as halogen&#8208;atom transfer (XAT) agents for the activation of alkyl iodides. We apply this concept as part of a Giese alkylation, producing sp3&#8208;rich scaffolds under simple photoredox conditions. We also showcase the applicability of this XAT approach as part of a dual catalysis process for desaturation.

Halogen&#8208;atom transfer (XAT) is an important method for the generation of carbon radicals. Hence, the development of new XAT agents has emerged as an important research avenue in organic synthesis. Aryl radicals are particularly promising XAT agents but have witnessed limited application. Herein, we introduce a protocol that repurposes widely available aryl boronic acids as XAT agents for alkyl iodide activation. We exemplify this concept on a Giese reaction, constructing valuable, sp3&#8208;rich scaffolds. The reaction is highly efficient and tolerant of a variety of sensitive functional groups. Furthermore, we showcase the compatibility of our boronic acid XAT agents in processes based on the use of transition metals, like cobalt for desaturative purposes.

         <title>Photoinduced Free&#8208;Radical Preparation of Bis&#8208;Phosphonates and Bis&#8208;Phosphinates from Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple procedure for the double hydrophospho(i)nylation of terminal alkynes, using photoinduced organic radical chemistry, is reported in order to access bisphosphonates and bisphosphinates. The reaction is carried out in air without any metal catalyst or ligand.

A one&#8208;pot access to alkyl&#8208;bisphosphonates and alkyl&#8208;bisphosphinates was developed using affordable starting materials (terminal alkynes and low&#8208;cost photoinitiator), no metal catalyst, neither ligand, and no or little amounts of solvents. The radical reaction proceeded smoothly under UV exposure, the reaction conditions were optimized and the scope of the reaction was explored.

         <title>Photoinduced Deprotection of Tetrahydropyranyl Ethers with High Selectivity and Ultrahigh Efficiency</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, environmentally friendly, and selective photoinduced reaction for the deprotection of various tetrahydropyranyl ethers has been established that occurs in the presence of ultralow quantities of catalytic bromotrichloromethane through irradiation with UV light.

A photoinduced deprotection of tetrahydropyranyl (THP) ethers under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions is reported. The transformation proceeded well in good to excellent yields (up to 98%) in the presence of 0.1&#8201;mol% of BrCCl3. THP ethers of both aliphatic alcohols and phenols were deprotected efficiently with high selectivity. Other acid&#8208;sensitive protecting groups (AcO, NHBoc, and ketal) were well tolerated. This convenient methodology has also been successfully extended to typical natural product scaffolds, including amino acid derivative, sugar, and cholesterol derivatives.

         <title>Density Functional Theory Study on Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Carboxylation of Alkenes with CO2</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate the mechanism of visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven carboxylation of alkenes with CO2 mediated by a photoredox catalyst. Spin polarization selectively weakens the C&#946;&#63743;C&#947; bond, resulting in a significantly lower cleavage barrier compared to the C&#945;&#63743;C&#946; bond, thereby dictating the reaction regioselectivity.

Since cleaving C&#8211;C bonds for carboxylation with CO2 is far more challenging because of their inherent and less favorable orbital directionality for interacting with transition metals, a photocatalytic approach for the deconstructive carboxylation of alkenes with CO2, is a remarkable methodology for producing carboxylic acids. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been carried out to study visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic deconstructive carboxylation of alkenes with CO2, which is reported by the Meng's group. The calculation results also confirm the experimental observation that under photoredox catalysis, &#945;&#8208;amino radicals can be captured by C=C bonds to form hydroaminoalkylation products.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of Highly Fluorinated Biphenyls by Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution (SNAr) between Potassium Perfluorobenzoates and Polyfluoroarenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free strategy has been developed for the construction of highly fluorinated biphenyls through SNAr of potassium perfluorobenzoates with polyfluoroarenes. This operationally simple protocol proceeds through an operationally simple protocol and offers broad substrate scope, providing a practical alternative to traditional cross&#8208;coupling approaches.

Highly fluorinated biphenyls are valuable motifs in various applications. Traditional methods for their synthesis often require expensive catalysts, harsh conditions, and sensitive reagents. Herein, a practical, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free strategy for the synthesis of highly fluorinated biphenyls is reported via nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) between potassium perfluorobenzoates and polyfluoroarenes. This method through an operationally simple protocol, using bench&#8208;stable nucleophiles, enabling efficient access to structurally diverse biphenyls. It offers broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and operational simplicity, providing an alternative to existing methods.

         <title>Electrochemical Annulation/Thiolation of o&#8208;Vinylphenyl Isocyanides with Diorgano Disulfides to Access 2&#8208;Sulfenylquinolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An eco&#8208;friendly procedure for the synthesis of a series of 2&#8208;organosulfenylquinolines was developed by the electrochemical annulation/sulfenylation of o&#8208;vinylphenyl isocyanides with diorgano disulfides. The transformation occurred in good to excellent yields under mild conditions, avoiding the use of a noble metal catalyst and a large amount of oxidants.
Owing to the excellent biological activities of quinolines and organic chalcogenides, organosulfenylquinolines, which contain both sulfur and quinolinones, may have potential biological activity. To solve the existing problems for their generation, an electrochemical annulation/thiolation of o&#8208;vinylphenyl isocyanides with diorgano disulfides to give 2&#8208;sulfenylquinolines is reported. As compared to previous methods, this procedure has the advantages of mild reaction conditions, good substrate applicability, and environmental friendliness.

         <title>Acylsilanes for Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Reversed&#8208;Polarity Synthesis of Diaryl Ketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diaryl ketones are important structural motifs in various fields. Although synthetic methods for preparing diaryl ketones have been developed, we present a reversed&#8208;polarity palladium&#8208;catalyzed reaction between acylsilanes and diaryliodonium salts as a versatile alternative synthetic approach. This strategy enables the efficient synthesis of functionalized diaryl ketones, exhibiting broad synthetic utility and good functional group compatibility.

Diaryl ketones are versatile building blocks widely utilized in pharmaceuticals, materials science, and synthetic chemistry. Due to their structural importance and utility, many synthetic studies have been reported. Traditionally, diaryl ketones have been prepared via Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation, even though this method suffers from limited functional group tolerance under acidic conditions. More recently, transition&#8208;metal catalyzed strategies have emerged, typically involving the coupling between carbonyl electrophiles and organometallics. As an alternative, we report the reversed&#8208;polarity synthesis of diaryl ketones using acylsilanes as carbonyl nucleophilic coupling partners in the presence of palladium catalyst. Inspired by our previous work on the synthesis of imines using imidoylsilanes, diaryliodonium salts were chosen as electrophilic partners. During optimization, the use of CsF was found to be essential, likely due to fluoride&#8208;mediated activation of acylsilanes and facilitation of the transmetalation. Various functionalized diaryl ketones, including more complex derivatives bearing tetrahydrotetramethylnaphthalene (TMN) moieties, were successfully synthesized using this method, demonstrating the synthetic utility.

The cascade Sonogashira coupling/annulation of ethyl 4&#8208;(benzoyloxy)&#8208;5&#8208;bromo&#8208;6&#8208;methylquinoline&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylate with terminal alkynes under copper(I) catalysis is described.

Pyrano[2,3,4&#8208;de]quinoline&#8208;encompassing scaffolds are high&#8208;value, intricate synthetic targets that are of interest in medicinal chemistry. Herein, we illustrate the first example of a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed cascade Sonogashira coupling/annulation reaction of ethyl 4&#8208;(benzoyloxy)&#8208;5&#8208;bromo&#8208;6&#8208;methylquinoline&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylate with internal alkynes.

We have developed Ru(II)&#8208; or Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H allylation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;indole with vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs), 2&#8208;vinyl&#8208;ethylene oxide, and 2&#8208;vinylaziridine, synthesizing a series of indole scaffolds. This is the first report of allylation of 3H&#8208;indole with VCPs.

The Ru(II)&#8208; and Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H/C&#63743;C bond activation and subsequent allylation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;indoles with vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs), 2&#8208;vinyl&#8208;ethylene oxide, and 2&#8208;vinylaziridine are reported, enabling the expedient preparation of a wide spectrum for indole derivatives. This transformation proceeds using a cascade sequence involving C&#63743;H bond activation, C&#63743;C bond cleavage of VCPs, and 1,2&#8208;migratory alkene insertion.

         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced regioselective C8 arylation of quinolinones has been achieved through a dual transition metal and photoredox catalytic strategy, affording the desired products in yields up to 85%.

A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated regioselective C8 arylation of quinolinones has been developed by merging transition&#8208;metal catalysis with photoredox catalysis. This approach offers broad substrate scope and mild reaction conditions, affording the desired products in up to 85% yield. Furthermore, to investigate the reaction mechanism, several control experiments were performed, including fluorescence quenching studies, quantum yield measurements, light&#8208;on/off experiments, kinetic isotope effect (KIE) analysis, and H/D labeling experiments. This strategy exhibits excellent scalability and also enables subsequent C2 alkenylation.

         <title>Chemoselective Divergence via Substrate Control: Decarboxylative and Decarbonylative Coupling of 2&#8208;Oxoacids with Allylic Difluorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic method for the decarboxylative C&#63743;C coupling of 2&#8208;oxoacids and allylic difluorides has been developed, yielding monofluoroalkenes in excellent yields. The reaction tolerates both aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;oxoacids and displays high functional group tolerance. With primary alkyl and aryl 2&#8208;oxoacids, acyl radicals are formed and perform addition on the allylic difluoride. Alternatively, when secondary and tertiary alkyl substituents are used, the acyl radical intermediate may undergo further decarbonylation, generating alkyl radicals that form alkylated monofluoroalkenes upon addition. A mechanistic rationale for the competitive decarboxylation/decarbonylation cascade is provided through both experimental and computational data.

Herein, we report the photocatalytic decarboxylative coupling of allylic difluorides and carbon&#8208;centered radicals, which are formed from 2&#8208;oxoacids. This mild and operationally simple protocol enables selective synthesis of monofluoroalkenes via defluorinative C&#63743;C bond formation. Primary and aryl 2&#8208;oxoacids undergo direct acyl radical addition to allylic difluorides, yielding acylated products exclusively. In contrast, secondary 2&#8208;oxoacids afford mixtures of acylated and alkylated products, while tertiary 2&#8208;oxoacids selectively deliver alkylated products via a decarboxylative/decarbonylation cascade. Thus, the product distribution can be tuned by the substitution pattern of the 2&#8208;oxoacids. The rate of decarbonylation versus radical addition is based on the stability and reactivity of the radical intermediates formed. Computational studies confirm a substrate&#8208;dependent divergence in reaction pathways, with primary 2&#8208;oxoacids undergoing direct acyl radical addition, while secondary and tertiary substrates exhibit competing decarbonylation leading to alkylated products. This study therefore establishes a mechanistic rationale for competitive acylation/alkylation processes starting from 2&#8208;oxoacids.

         <title>Preparation of Se(IV) Aryltrifluoromethylselenide Dichlorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient synthesis of dichloro(aryl)(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;&#955;4&#8208;selanes via chlorination of aryl trifluoromethylselenides with SO2Cl2 is reported. The compounds were fully characterized and their stability studied. Density functional theory studies reveal an asynchronous concerted, exergonic pathway, while formation of the Se(VI) derivative is both kinetically and thermodynamically unfeasible.

Trifluoromethylselenide dichlorides are rare selenium(IV) derivatives that have received limited attention despite their potential in organoselenium chemistry. We report a straightforward and efficient synthesis of dichloro(aryl)(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;&#955;4&#8208;selanes (ArSeCl2CF3) via chlorination of aryl trifluoromethylselenides in acetonitrile as the solvent of choice. After evaluating various chlorinating agents, sulfuryl chloride (SO2Cl2) revealed to be very efficient in a broad scope of substrates. Complementary density functional theory calculations provided mechanistic insight, indicating that chlorination proceeds via an asynchronous concerted mechanism with an accessible activation barrier and is exergonic, readily leading to the formation of Se(IV) fluorinated compounds. In contrast, the formation of the Se(VI) tetra&#8208;chlorinated derivative via oxidative addition of Cl2 to the Se(IV) derivative was found to be both kinetically and thermodynamically infeasible.

Oxidation of hexahydro&#8208;5H&#8208;furo[2,3&#8208;b]pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;d][1,4]oxazin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one with mCPBA furnished stable chiral tertiary amine N&#8208;oxides. A Polonovski&#8208;type intramolecular acyl transfer of these N&#8208;oxides led unexpectedly to the formation of a novel hexahydrofuro[3,2&#8208;d]pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;b]oxazol&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;one framework. Subsequent treatment of the resulting carbinolamines with a Lewis acid generated highly congested 3,9a&#8208;methanopyrrolo[2,1&#8208;c][1,4]oxazepines.

         <title>Synthetic Studies Toward Rubioncolin B</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report synthetic studies toward rubioncolin B (1), a heptacyclic naphthohydroquinone dimer with antitumor activity. The intermolecular [4&#8201;+&#8201;2]&#8208;cycloaddition between an ortho&#8208;naphthoquinone methide and a naphthofuran derivative led to the construction of a hexacyclic skeleton. Subsequent Wittig reaction and cyclization furnished a cyclic acetal with the same ring structure as 1, providing a versatile platform for diverse analogs.

Herein, we report our synthetic studies toward rubioncolin B (1), a heptacyclic naphthohydroquinone dimer with antitumor activity. Our strategy is based on the intermolecular [4&#8201;+&#8201;2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction between an ortho&#8208;naphthoquinone methide (o&#8208;NQM), which is generated in situ from a 1&#8208;naphthol derivative under catalytic Lewis acid conditions, and a naphthofuran derivative, thereby enabling the construction of a hexacyclic compound. We then explored three synthetic approaches for appending the remaining ring structure to the hexacyclic compound. Among them, the sequence involving the introduction of a Wittig reagent and subsequent cyclization proved effective, furnishing a cyclic acetal with the same ring structure as 1. This strategy not only demonstrates that accessing the highly congested architecture of 1 is feasible but also provides a versatile platform for the synthesis of structurally diverse analogs, thereby facilitating subsequent biological investigations, including structure&#8211;activity relationship studies.

         <title>Synthesis of Antibacterial C16 Cis&#8208;Unsaturated Fatty Acids by Transfer Semihydrogenation of Long&#8208;Chain Alkynes Catalyzed by Palladium&#8211;Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine Carbene Complexes</title>

The transfer semihydrogenation of long&#8208;chain alkynyl alcohols catalyzed by Pd&#8211;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine carbene (IPC) PEPPSI&#8208;type complexes, along with the subsequent derivatization of the resulting alkenyl alcohols into the corresponding fatty acids, was investigated. The electronic properties of the carbene, modulated by IPC substituents, enhanced catalytic activity. Additionally, the antibacterial properties of the synthesized fatty acids against Staphylococcus aureus were evaluated.

The synthesis of C16 cis&#8208;unsaturated fatty acids was investigated using Pd&#8211;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine carbene (IPC) pyridine&#8208;enhanced precatalyst preparation stabilization and initiation (PEPPSI)&#8208;type complexes as catalysts. These complexes efficiently promote the transfer semihydrogenation of long&#8208;chain alkynyl alcohols. The electronic properties of the carbene, modulated by IPC substituents, influence the &#960;&#8208;accepting character of the metal center, enhancing catalytic activity. The resulting cis&#8208;alkenyl alcohols are readily converted into C16 cis&#8208;unsaturated fatty acids. Antibacterial evaluation against Staphylococcus aureus reveals that the position of the double bond is crucial for biological activity.

         <title>Crucial Role of Oxidation for the Prebiotic Peptide Elongation Promoted by Carbonyl Sulfide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prebiotic activation of amino acid (AA) into peptides via N&#8208;carboxyanhydride (NCA), promoted by carbonyl sulfide (COS), cannot proceed without an oxidizing step (enabling better leaving groups than sulfur dianion). While being efficient even at mild pH the prebiotic scope of COS promoted activation of AA, it is however limited because side reactions on amide species hinder peptide elongation.

Both the emergence and sustainability of dissipative chemical systems, such as protometabolisms, require a constant flow of free energy, which can, among other possibilities, be provided by chemical activating agents. Several prebiotically plausible candidates have been identified, but none are flawless or even sufficiently efficient to consider this question resolved. This study revisits and extends previous work on amino acid activation and peptide elongation promoted by carbonyl sulfide in aqueous medium which proceeds via the formation of N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (NCAs). Through an approach aimed at providing new mechanistic insights, it demonstrates that oxidation of the thiocarbamate adduct is mandatory for subsequent NCA and peptide bond formation and that ferricyanide, as an oxidizing agent example, efficiently promotes the reaction even at mild pH. However, side reactions, such as urea/hydantoin formation, were confirmed to strongly limit the prebiotic scope of this N&#8208;terminal peptide elongation route.

         <title>Cyclopropyl for Gem&#8208;Dimethyl: Synthesis and Olfactory Properties of Linear Musks with Cyclopropyl Spacers**</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fusing the gem&#8208;dimethyl groups into a cyclopropyl ring in the spacer of linear alicyclic musk odorants subtly changes the molecular geometry and polarity of the target structures while the musk odour is retained or even intensified. Aromatic analogues and methylcyclopropane derivatives in contrast were found completely odourless..

Linear musks with cyclopropylmethyl spacers in place of 2&#8208;methylpropyl spacers were designed, synthesised and evaluated olfactorily. Their synthesis commenced from commercially available 1&#8208;(3&#8242;, 3&#8242;&#8208;dimethylcyclohexyl)ethanone (Herbac) and 3&#8208;methyl benzaldehyde via the corresponding methyl carbinols, Cyclodumol and 1&#8208;(m&#8208;tolyl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;ol, which were esterified with a protected glycolic acid and then transformed into the corresponding cyclopropyl compound by Tebbe olefination in tandem with Simmons&#8211;Smith cyclopropanation. After deprotection and esterification with various short&#8208;chain carboxylic acids, their qualitative olfactory evaluation revealed that fusing the gem&#8208;dimethyl groups into a cyclopropyl ring retains and even intensifies the musk scent. Methylation of the cyclopropyl ring however completely erases not only the distinct musk character but virtually any odour.

         <title>Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Mucocin Using a Diastereoselective Oxypalladation and Cross&#8208;Metathesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;mucocin isolated from Rollinia mucosa (Annonaceae) was achieved. Stereoselective construction of the tetrahydropyran (THP) ring moiety was performed using diastereoselective oxypalladation. The tetrahydrofuran (THF) ring moiety was prepared from (S)&#8208;(&#8211;)&#8208;malic acid. The cross&#8208;metathesis reaction between the THP and THF moieties afforded the nonadjacent THP&#8211;THF core part. Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling of the &#947;&#8208;lactone portion with the THP&#8211;THF core part followed by reduction of the enyne and removal of the protecting groups afforded (&#8722;)&#8208;mucocin.

         <title>From Light&#8208;Driven to Dark Synthesis: Streamlining Perfluoroalkyl Selenide Ether Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two orthogonal and user&#8208;friendly protocols enable the efficient construction of (Se/S)&#63743;RF bonds from simple dichalcogenides and perfluoroalkyl iodides. Visible&#8208;light irradiation at 395&#8201;nm promotes seleno&#8208; and thioether formation, while a dark KOH/MeCN variant delivers selenoethers in minutes. Both approaches operate under mild, metal&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions, tolerate biologically relevant substrates, and scale smoothly to gram quantities.

Two complementary and operationally simple methods enable the efficient perfluoroalkylation of organodiselenides: (i) direct visible&#8208;light irradiation at 395&#8201;nm in aqueous MeCN with RF&#8211;I, requiring no photocatalyst, and (ii) a base&#8208;promoted protocol using KOH in MeCN under dark conditions. Both furnished perfluoroalkyl selenoethers in excellent yields, while only the photoinduced protocol delivered good to excellent yields of perfluoroalkyl thioethers from organodisulfides. The direct irradiation approach also enables the preparation of Se&#8208; and S&#8208;perfluoroalkylated derivatives of selenocysteine and cysteine, highlighting the applicability to biologically relevant substrates. Both protocols feature excellent chemical selectivity, good functional group tolerance, mild conditions, and simple operation. Compared with existing photocatalytic and thermal methods, these approaches provide greater versatility and operational simplicity, exemplified by the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of a perfluoroalkyl selenoether in excellent yield.

         <title>Toward Novel Trifluoromethylated Peptidomimetics: A Case Study of Cathepsin C Inhibitors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of CF3&#8208;containing amino acid analogues is prepared and studied by docking to Cathepsin C. The results highlight their potential as peptidomimetics and showcase the value of fluorination in drug design.

Herein, both synthetic and theoretical results related to the development of amino acid analogues containing a CF3&#8208;olefinic moiety and their evaluation as potential inhibitors of Cathepsin C are presented. The key synthetic steps include the trifluoromethylation using the Ruppert&#8211;Prakash reagent and a Horner&#8211;Wadsworth&#8211;Emmons olefination to obtain the desired CF3&#8208;alkenyl amino acid derivatives. In recent years, theoretical approaches based on molecular docking have gained significant attention for predicting the biological activity of synthetic compounds as enzyme inhibitors. The research specifically targets Cathepsin C, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase I, a protease that plays a crucial role in activating various degradative enzymes involved in tissue damage during inflammatory diseases.
