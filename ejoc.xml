         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature illustrates the screening of amino organocatalysts employed in the activation of carbonyl compounds by ESI&#8208;MS. The off&#8208;line reaction monitoring provided information on the active intermediates, the putative catalytic cycles, and the reaction speed. The ESI&#8208;MS investigations coupled with the enantioselective HPLC data allow selecting the more efficient organocatalyst. Cover design by Alessia Ciogli and Simone Manetto. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Ciogli et&#8197;al.

         <title>Synthesis of a Substituted [10]Cycloparaphenylene through [2+2+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient synthesis of a tetra&#8208;substituted [10]cycloparaphenylene (CPP) is reported. The introduction of a diethylphthalane gives valuable insight into the incorporation of highly substituted units into these nanohoops. Finally, a seven&#8208;step synthesis with an overall yield of 8&#8201;% provided the target compound while different expected and unexpected obstacles were overcome.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis and investigation of a substituted [10]cycloparaphenylene (CPP) incorporating a diethylphthalane unit. An efficient strategy relying on a symmetric built&#8208;up starting with propargyl ether as [2+2+2] cycloaddition precursor was developed. The straightforward synthesis required overcoming unexpected obstacles within the [2+2+2] cycloaddition, protection and aromatization. These results give valuable insights for accessing CPPs with highly substituted subunits. Finally, a seven&#8208;step synthesis with an overall yield of 8&#8201;% provided the target nanoring, including good to excellent yields for the critical macrocyclization and aromatization. The synthesized nanohoop exhibits a hypsochromic shift in fluorescence and absorption, compared to the unsubstituted [10]CPP. This observation is proposedly caused by an increased torsion angle between the bivalent substituted phenyl moieties and the adjacent units.

The Front Cover represents a metaphor for the enantioselectivity produced by the organocatalyst in the studied reaction. Just like a traveler would never choose the dark and unsafe pathway and would always go through the light and easy road, the catalyst leads the reactants through the lowest energy transition state, producing the R enantiomer of the product over the S.

         <title>Convergent and Practical Synthesis of Fluorescent Triphenylamine Derivatives and Their Localization in Living Cells</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 2, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convergent synthesis of various triphenylamine derivatives led to a small library of fluorophores showing different photophysical properties. The position of the pyridinium (ortho, meta, para) has an influence on the color of the fluorophore (from yellow to red) as well as on its cellular localization (mitochondria or nucleus).







Abstract
In the search for new fluorescent triphenylamine (TP) derivatives, we studied the influence of the position and substitution of diverse heterocyclic substituents. A library of 10 fluorescent triphenylamines bearing either oxazoles or thiazoles and pyridiniums, substituted at different positions has been developed. The approach is based on a convergent C&#8722;H activation reaction between pyridine&#8208;oxazoles or pyridine&#8208;thiazoles and di&#8208;iodo triphenylamine. We showed that the nature and substitution pattern of the 5&#8208;membered&#8208; (oxazole, thiazole) or 6&#8208;membered heterocycle (pyridine) has a strong influence on their fluorescence properties and on their localization in living cells as they stain either the nucleus or mitochondria.

         <title>Synthesis of Aryl Sulfides by Metal&#8208;Free Arylation of Thiols with Diaryliodonium Salts under Basic Conditions**
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 2, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl sulfides are synthesized by metal&#8208;free arylation of thiols with diaryliodonium salts under basic conditions. The protocol features easy performance, mild conditions, and short reaction time. It provides access to an array of products, including such that contain complex moieties of biological and therapeutic relevance (e.&#8201;g., heterocycles, a carbohydrate). DFT calculations demonstrate that the reaction proceeds via the formation of Ar2I(SR) intermediate, followed by the C&#8722;S forming reductive elimination.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free arylation of thiols with diaryliodonium salts has been developed. The application of a strong organic base enables the C&#8722;S bond formation under mild and experimentally simple conditions. The method allows for the synthesis of aryl sulfides containing a broad range of aryl groups from an array of thiols, including aryl, heteroaryl, and alkyl ones. The mechanism of the reaction was studied by DFT calculations, demonstrating that it proceeds via the inner sphere pathway involving formation of an Ar2I(SR) intermediate, followed by reductive elimination.

The mechanism of the reaction was studied by DFT calculations, demonstrating that it proceeds via the inner sphere pathway involving formation of an Ar&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I(SR) intermediate, followed by reductive elimination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Fluorinated Amides Starting from Carbohydrates Based on the Claisen Rearrangement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 2, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a small library of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated and &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds based on the Claisen rearrangement is reported. Fluorinated olefins were used as building blocks supplying fluorine atoms. As a result, fluorinated esters and alcohols were also obtained. They are a valuable material for subsequent transformations. The methodology presented in this work could be applied to a wide range of compounds as a valuable tool to construct unnatural amino acids or peptidomimetics.







Abstract
The search for new methods for installation of fluorine atoms into organic molecules is still a widely studied issue. In this work, an efficient synthetic protocol for the synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing amides derived from sugar has been presented. This approach involved the Claisen rearrangement of previously obtained fluorinated vinyl ethers. The three fluorinated olefins: 1,1,3,3,3&#8208;pentafluoroprop&#8208;1&#8208;ene (2H&#8208;PFP), 1,2,3,3,3&#8208;pentafluoroprop&#8208;1&#8208;ene (1H&#8208;PFP) and hexafluoroprop&#8208;1&#8208;ene (HFP) were used as a source of fluorine. New compounds were characterized by 1H, 19F and 13C NMR spectroscopy and high resolution mass spectrometry. The X&#8208;ray crystal structures of some fluorinated derivatives were obtained confirming structure, geometry and absolute configuration. The resulting molecules, due to possibility of further transformation of their functional groups, can be valuable fluorinated scaffolds for the synthesis of subsequent chemical compounds.

         <title>Carbonylation Chemistry Applied to the Synthesis of Benzimidazo[2,1&#8208;b]quinazolin&#8208;12&#8208;ones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 2, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthetic route towards benzimidazo[2,1&#8208;b]quinazolin&#8208;12&#8208;ones has been developed, which relies on the Pd&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular aminocarbonylation of N&#8208;(2&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;amines. Using near stoichiometric amounts of 13CO, isotopically labelled benzimidazo[2,1&#8208;b]quinazolin&#8208;12&#8208;ones were synthesized.







Abstract
A carbonylative route towards the synthesis of benzimidazo[2,1&#8208;b]quinazolin&#8208;12&#8208;ones was developed. The key step in this strategy consists of an intramolecular carbonylative lactam formation, starting from N&#8208;(2&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;amines. These precursor molecules were synthesized by two different methods to introduce a variety of substituents on the aromatic ring systems. Interestingly, only near&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of carbon monoxide were required in the ring&#8208;closing aminocarbonylation reaction, rendering the developed strategy also suitable for late&#8208;stage 13C&#8208;isotopic labelling.

         <title>Dyn[n]arenes: Versatile Platforms To Study the Interplay between Covalent and Noncovalent Bonds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 2, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite a growing number of reports involving dyn[n]arenes, there is still plenty of room for further exciting developments that could result from a better exposure of these cavitands, which is the ambition of this account.







Abstract
Dyn[n]arenes are the strict polydisulfide&#8208;based analogues of pillar[n]arenes. Although less famous than their static homologues, these dynamic cavitands possess unique (stereo)chemical features. The disulfide bridge between monomeric units not only provides these architectures with constitutional lability but is also an additional stereogenic element. As a result, the covalent assembling process can be guided by supramolecular interactions with or without a targeted partner, enabling to decipher supramolecular at work from the synthetic stage. Not only can the size and functions be chosen on demand, but the stereochemical features can be precisely controlled by careful choice on the assembling conditions. Eventually, deciphering the interactions at work during self&#8208;assembly opens the way toward innovative applications such as biomolecules sensing. This account describes the synergistic interplay between covalent and noncovalent bounds found in dyn[n]arenes.

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Acyl&#8208;Isoxazoles via Radical 5&#8208;endo trig Cyclization of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones with NaNO2</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 2, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to synthesize 3&#8208;acyl&#8208;isoxazoles from easily available &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones in a one&#8208;pot reaction was developed, and differently substituted 3&#8208;acyl&#8208;isoxazoles were obtained via radical 5&#8208;endo trig cyclization. The scope of substrates was rather broad.







Abstract
Here we report a facile cyclization reaction of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones with NaNO2 under mild conditions to construct 3&#8208;acyl&#8208;isoxazoles. This transformation is realized via nitrosation of the activated methylene, radical 5&#8208;endo trig cyclization, and then aromatization, according to some control experiments.

     alt="Synthesis of 3-Acyl-Isoxazoles via Radical 5-endo trig Cyclization of &#946;,&#947;-Unsaturated Ketones with NaNO2"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new strategy to synthesize 3-acyl-isoxazoles from easily available &#946;,&#947;-unsaturated ketones in a one-pot reaction was developed, and differently substituted 3-acyl-isoxazoles were obtained via radical 5-&lt;i&gt;endo trig&lt;/i&gt; cyclization. The scope of substrates was rather broad.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we report a facile cyclization reaction of &#946;,&#947;-unsaturated ketones with NaNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under mild conditions to construct 3-acyl-isoxazoles. This transformation is realized via nitrosation of the activated methylene, radical 5-&lt;i&gt;endo trig&lt;/i&gt; cyclization, and then aromatization, according to some control experiments. Further, this protocol provided an efficient access to a variety of isoxazoles from readily available allyl ketones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Electronic Properties of Conjugated syn,syn&#8208;Dithienothiazine Donor&#8208;Acceptor&#8208;Donor Dumbbells</title>

Conjugated syn,syn&#8208;dithienothiazine donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor dumbbells accessible by Suzuki coupling or a one&#8208;pot &#945;&#8208;lithiation&#8208;zincation&#8208;Negishi coupling sequence are redox active low band gap luminophores.







Abstract
A series of conjugated syn,syn&#8208;dithienothiazine donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor dumbbells is readily synthesized by Suzuki coupling or a one&#8208;pot &#945;&#8208;lithiation&#8208;zincation&#8208;Negishi coupling sequence in moderate to good yield. The title compounds are all electron&#8208;rich reversible oxidizable redox systems with a relatively narrow range of oxidation potentials according to cyclic voltammetry. UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy however show a significant effect of the electronic nature of the conjugated bridging system on absorption and emission characteristics. Furthermore, a highly polar excited state can be corroborated by Lippert&#8208;Mataga analysis of the emission solvatochromicity as well as by TD&#8208;DFT calculation of absorption and emission maxima, which classify these dumbbell systems as redox active, luminescent low band gap chromophores with experimentally determined optical band gaps between 2.20 and 2.50&#8197;eV.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Transformation of Lignin and Lignin Model Compounds into Benzimidazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 2, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free DDQ catalyzed depolymerization strategy was developed to transform lignin models or natural lignin into various benzimidazole containing compounds (up to 94&#8201;% yield). Both &#946;&#8208;C and &#947;&#8208;C atoms of lignin can be also utilized to produce desirable products. More importantly, this method can realize the oxidation, degradation and valorization of natural lignin in an one&#8208;pot manner.







Abstract
It is a challenging task to simultaneously achieve selective depolymerization and valorization of lignin due to their complex structure and relatively stable bonds. We herein report an efficient depolymerization strategy that employs 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) as oxidant/catalyst to selectively convert different oxidized lignin models to a wide variety of 2&#8208;phenylbenzimidazole&#8208;based compounds in up to 94&#8201;% yields, by reacting with o&#8208;phenylenediamines with varied substituents. This method could take full advantage of both C&#946; and/or C&#947; atom in lignin structure to furnish the desirable products instead of forming byproducts, thus exhibiting high atom economy. Furthermore, this strategy can effectively transform both the oxidized hardwood (birch) and softwood (pine) lignin into the corresponding degradation products in up to 45&#8197;wt% and 30&#8197;wt%, respectively. Through a &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; process, we have successfully realized the oxidation/depolymerization/valorization of natural birch lignin at the same time and produced the benzimidazole derivatives in up to 67&#8197;wt% total yields.

         <title>Tuning Material Properties of Porous Organic Cage CC3 with Postsynthetic Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 2, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diamine linkers in the porous organic cage CC3 are partially substituted post&#8208;synthetically with isostructural linkers with different functionalities. This method provides another approach to access potentially useful cage structures for a variety of applications.







Abstract
Porous organic cages (POCs) represent a new class of microporous materials with an impressive breadth of potential applications. One of their many advantages is the degree of tunability of cage properties, similar to that seen in more established microporous materials like metal&#8208;organic frameworks. In this work, a prototypical POC, CC3, is used to explore the potential to tune cage properties via post&#8208;synthetic dynamic covalent chemistry. Ethylenediamine, the linker used in another POC, CC1, was partially substituted into the CC3 cage structure to varying degrees based on the starting relative molar ratios. The resulting products were investigated for the relative distribution of the two linkers, crystallinity, and surface area. It was found that even when small amounts of other compatible diamine linkers are introduced, they substitute into the existing cages, although some structural products are apparently favored over others within the reactant ratios investigated.

Here reports a copper&#8208;catalyzed approach for the synthesis of 2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes. The reaction was proposed to proceed by a sequence of radical addition, ring&#8208;opening, and cyclization of methylenecyclopropanes with potassium benzyltrifluoroborate. Such a method features operational simplicity, mild reaction conditions and widely functional group tolerance and accords a diverse array of 3,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
A Copper&#8208;catalyzed benzylation of methylenecyclopropanes with potassium benzyltrifluoroborate salts has been developed to produce 2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes in moderate to good yields. This oxidative cyclization reaction proceeds well via a sequence of radical addition, ring&#8208;opening, and cyclization. This protocol represents a new example of methylenecyclopropane oxidative cyclization and tolerates a diverse range of substrate.

         <title>Enantioselective Povarov Reactions: An Update of a Powerful Catalytic Synthetic Methodology</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 2, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
One of the best&#8208;studied routes to prepare chiral tetrahydroquinolines is known as the enantioselective Povarov reaction. In this Minireview enantioselective Povarov reactions published since 2014 are presented, according to the chiral catalyst used, either an organocatalyst or a metal complex, and discussed. When possible, special attention has been given to the rationalization of the stereochemical outcome of the reaction, discussing transition states and catalytic cycles.







Abstract
The enantioselective Povarov reaction is one of the most powerful synthetic strategy to synthesize chiral, highly functionalized 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines. The present Minireview aims to collect the most significant successful examples of highly efficient enantioselective catalytic protocols for this reaction, since 2014. A comprehensive discussion of different catalytic strategies employed in recent years to realize the enantioselective Povarov reaction is provided; the use of chiral phosphoric acids, thio(urea) and proline derivatives, as well as transition metal complexes will be presented.

     alt="Enantioselective Povarov Reactions: An Update of a Powerful Catalytic Synthetic Methodology"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best-studied routes to prepare chiral tetrahydroquinolines is known as the enantioselective Povarov reaction. In this Minireview enantioselective Povarov reactions published since 2014 are presented, according to the chiral catalyst used, either an organocatalyst or a metal complex, and discussed. When possible, special attention has been given to the rationalization of the stereochemical outcome of the reaction, discussing transition states and catalytic cycles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enantioselective Povarov reaction is one of the most powerful synthetic strategy to synthesize chiral, highly functionalized 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines. The present Minireview aims to collect the most significant successful examples of highly efficient enantioselective catalytic protocols for this reaction, since 2014. A comprehensive discussion of different catalytic strategies employed in recent years to realize the enantioselective Povarov reaction is provided; the use of chiral phosphoric acids, thio(urea) and proline derivatives, as well as transition metal complexes will be presented. Additionally, this Minireview critically discusses the intriguing and yet obscure mechanistic pathways of this well-known reaction, the controversial dispute between a concerted or a polar two-step process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of Tetracyclic Core Skeleton of Cephalotaxus Diterpenoids through Diastereoselective Pauson&#8208;Khand Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 2, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy to the tetracyclic core skeleton of Cephalotaxus diterpenoids has been developed based on diastereoselective Pauson&#8208;Khand reactions. It builds up a good foundation for our further work on synthesis of these natural products.







Abstract
Cephalotaxus diterpenoids represent a class of attractive natural products with diverse chemical structures and valuable biological activities. The Construction of tetracyclic core skeleton plays an important role in synthesizing these compounds. We report here the development of diastereoselective Pauson&#8208;Khand reactions as an effective strategy to the core structure, which enabled the total synthesis of (+)&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyfortalpinoid F, (+)&#8208;fortalpinoid A, and (+)&#8208;cephinoid H.

         <dc:description>
An efficient iridium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H reaction of non&#8208;aromatic tertiary enamides was successfully developed under mild reaction conditions and with high regioselectivity, leading to original C&#8208;3 borylated enamides in good yields. These derivatives could then be exploited in Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reactions, or converted into valuable 3,3&#8208;dihalogenopiperidine derivatives through short reaction times with moderate to good yields.







Abstract
An efficient catalytic preparation of synthetically useful new &#946;&#8208;borylated enamides was achieved under relatively mild conditions via a regioselective iridium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H borylation. The method features broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance and efficient scale&#8208;up. These C&#8208;3 borylated enamides can be advantageously exploited in cross&#8208;coupling reactions and converted into valuable 3,3&#8208;dihalogeno&#8208;2&#8208;methoxypiperidines in very short reaction times.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Doped PAH Electrochromes: Difurano, Dipyrano, and Furano&#8208;Pyrano Containing Naphthalene&#8208;Cored Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 2, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of naphthalenyl&#8208;cored O&#8208;doped small molecule electrochromes was achieved. In a single intramolecular Pummerer oxidative cycloetherification reaction, dipyrano, difurano, and furano&#8208;pyrano products could be obtained. All molecules showed p&#8208;type semiconducting and electrochromic properties, with the colour of the transition being dependent on the O&#8208;ring.







Abstract
In this work, we report the synthesis of O&#8208;doped naphthalene&#8208;based electrochromes. Exploiting the CuO&#8208;mediated Pummerer oxidative cycloetherification reaction, a series of 1,4&#8208; and 1,5&#8208;disubstituted naphthalene&#8208;cored dipyrano, difurano, and furano&#8208;pyrano polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been prepared. Steady&#8208;state UV&#8208;Vis absorption and emission investigations showed that the spectroscopic profile strongly depends on the O&#8208;doping topology, with the dipyrano and the difurano derivatives demonstrating the most red&#8208;shifted and blue&#8208;shifted electronic transition, respectively. Computational investigations revealed that the cycloetherification reaction raises the HOMO energy level (while the LUMO remains largely unaffected), with the dipyrano derivatives displaying the highest values. Spectroelectrochemical measurements showed that, depending on the O&#8208;topology and the type of O&#8208;ring, different electrochromic responses could be obtained with colour transitions featuring high contrasts involving yellow, pink, orange or blue colours.

         <title>Triflic Imide&#8208;Catalyzed Glycosylation of Disarmed Glycosyl ortho&#8208;Isopropenylphenylacetates and ortho&#8208;Isopropenylbenzyl Thioglycosides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 2, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient protocol for Tf2NH&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation of disarmed glycosyl ortho&#8208;isopropenylphenylacetates and ortho&#8208;isopropenylbenzyl thioglycosides has been established. Mechanistically, the reaction involves the preferential protonation of the isopropenyl group, the generation of reactive glycosylating species by the cation&#8208;triggering intramolecular cyclization, and the ensuing glycosylation event.







Abstract
Glycosylation reaction involving the coupling of a glycosyl donor with a glycosyl acceptor is one of the cornerstones of chemical preparation of pure glycans and glycoconjugates of biological relevance. Catalytic glycosylation of glycosyl ester donors and thioglycosides is an attractive but underexplored topic in carbohydrate chemistry. Herein, triflic imide (Tf2NH)&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation of various O&#8208;, S&#8208;, and C&#8208;nucleophiles has been achieved using disarmed glycosyl ortho&#8208;isopropenylphenylacetates (GIPPAs) and ortho&#8208;isopropenylbenzyl thioglycosides as glycosylating agents. The reactions proceed under mild conditions to give the desired glycosides in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. Of particular note, the comparable reactivity for the &#945;&#8208;isomers and the &#946;&#8208;ones of GIPPAs is observed. The mechanistic investigation demonstrates that the isopropenyl group is essential for the reaction and its preferential protonation triggers the reaction. This work provides another member to the arsenals of glycosyl ester and thioglycoside donors suitable for acid&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation to create various glycosidic bonds.

Mechanistically, the reaction involves the preferential protonation of the isopropenyl group, the generation of reactive glycosylating species by the cation-triggering intramolecular cyclization, and the ensuing glycosylation event.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glycosylation reaction involving the coupling of a glycosyl donor with a glycosyl acceptor is one of the cornerstones of chemical preparation of pure glycans and glycoconjugates of biological relevance. Catalytic glycosylation of glycosyl ester donors and thioglycosides is an attractive but underexplored topic in carbohydrate chemistry. Herein, triflic imide (Tf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH)-catalyzed glycosylation of various &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-, and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-nucleophiles has been achieved using disarmed glycosyl &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-isopropenylphenylacetates (GIPPAs) and &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-isopropenylbenzyl thioglycosides as glycosylating agents. The reactions proceed under mild conditions to give the desired glycosides in good-to-excellent yields. Of particular note, the comparable reactivity for the &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-isomers and the &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-ones of GIPPAs is observed. The mechanistic investigation demonstrates that the isopropenyl group is essential for the reaction and its preferential protonation triggers the reaction. This work provides another member to the arsenals of glycosyl ester and thioglycoside donors suitable for acid-catalyzed glycosylation to create various glycosidic bonds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The Cover Feature shows the color changes achieved, upon oxidation, by newly synthesized electrochromic oxygen&#8208;doped small molecules. The crucial moieties are furano and pyrano. Incorporation of these groups into other organic molecules can be used to greatly expand the library of electrochromic small molecules, giving very good control over color transition observed. Such controlled color changes could take electrochromism from the niche applications it currently occupies, to the wider world. Cover design by Adriana Lopez&#8208;Biagi.

         <title>Mechanistically Guided One Pot Synthesis of Phosphine&#8208;Phosphite and Its Implication in Asymmetric Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 2, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of hybrid phosphorus ligands is a multistep, time&#8208;consuming exercise. This limitation has been addressed by meticulous understanding of the process of formation of hybrid ligands and a one pot synthesis of a phosphine&#8208;phosphite ligand (L1) is reported for the first time. L1 coordinates to Rh and catalyzes asymmetric hydrogenation of 15 substrates with a high TOF of 2289 and enantiomeric excess of 92&#8201;%.







Abstract
Although hybrid bidentate ligands are known to yield highly enantioselective products in asymmetric hydrogenation (AH), synthesis of these ligands is an arduous process. Herein, a one pot, atom&#8208;economic synthesis of a hybrid phosphine&#8208;phosphite (L1) is reported. After understanding the reactivity difference between an O&#8208;nucleophile versus C&#8208;nucleophile, one pot synthesis of Senphos (L1) was achieved (72&#8201;%). When L1 was treated with [Rh], 31P NMR revealed bidentate coordination to Rh. Senphos, in the presence of rhodium, catalyzes the AH of Methyl&#8208;2&#8208;acetamido&#8208;3&#8208;phenylacrylate and discloses an unprecedented turn over frequency of 2289, along with excellent enantio&#8208;selectivity (92&#8201;%). The generality is demonstrated by hydrogenating an array of alkenes. The AH operates under mild conditions of 1&#8211;2&#8197;bar H2 pressure, at room temperature. The practical relevance of L1 is demonstrated by scaling&#8208;up the reaction to 1&#8197;g and by synthesizing DOPA, a drug widely employed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Computational insights indicate that the R isomer is preferred by 3.8&#8197;kcal/mol over the S isomer.

         <title>From Simple Alkenes and CO2 to Fluorinated Carboxylic Acids: Computational Studies and Predictions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 2, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated carboxylic acids can be envisaged as future synthetic targets because of their potential applications in materials science and medicinal chemistry. Computational studies suggest that these interesting compounds may be easily accessed from simple alkenes containing &#8722;CF3 or &#8722;SCF3 groups and carbon dioxide by means of a hydroboration/copper&#8208;catalyzed carboxylation sequence.







Abstract
Fluorinated carboxylic acids may soon become a relevant class of compounds for new materials development and as synthons in medicinal chemistry. In this report, a potential method based on a hydroboration/copper&#8208;catalyzed carboxylation reaction sequence has been computationally explored to check whether these moieties could be synthetically accessible. DFT calculations fully support the possibility of obtaining fluorinated carboxylic acids from simple fluorinated alkenes and gaseous carbon dioxide, paving the way to future preparation of this class of chemicals.

Abstract
We herein report for the first time a multi&#8208;step synthesis of a library of disaccharides and trisaccharides of the linkage region of proteoglycans (PGs) having a d&#8208;galactose modified at position C&#8208;2, C&#8208;4 or C&#8208;6 by replacing the hydroxyl group by methoxy or deoxy moieties.

         <title>Intramolecular Anti&#8208;Carbolithiation of Alkynes: Stereo&#8208;Directing Effect of Lithium&#8208;Coordinating Substituents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 2, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereochemical course of intramolecular carbolithiation of alkynes was, experimentally and computationally, investigated for the stereocontrolled preparation of alkylidene indenols. Reversal of syn&#8208;carbolithiation to anti&#8208;carbolithiation is observed in the presence of a lithium&#8208;chelating propargylic substituent. Electrophile trapping and domino process give access to tetrasubstituted compounds. Initial results on unprecedented enantioselective desymmetrizing carbolithiation are discussed.







Abstract
This paper presents the results of our investigations on the stereochemical course of intramolecular carbolithiation of alkynes. It is shown that the presence of a lithium&#8208;chelating propargylic substituent completely reverses the otherwise favored syn&#8208;process towards an anti&#8208;addition. The reaction was studied by both experiment and computation. Electrophile trapping and domino process led to the stereocontrolled preparation of tetrasubstituted alkylidene indenol derivatives.

     alt="Intramolecular Anti-Carbolithiation of Alkynes: Stereo-Directing Effect of Lithium-Coordinating Substituents"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stereochemical course of intramolecular carbolithiation of alkynes was, experimentally and computationally, investigated for the stereocontrolled preparation of alkylidene indenols. Reversal of &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-carbolithiation to &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-carbolithiation is observed in the presence of a lithium-chelating propargylic substituent. Electrophile trapping and domino process give access to tetrasubstituted compounds. Initial results on unprecedented enantioselective desymmetrizing carbolithiation are discussed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper presents the results of our investigations on the stereochemical course of intramolecular carbolithiation of alkynes. It is shown that the presence of a lithium-chelating propargylic substituent completely reverses the otherwise favored &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-process towards an &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-addition. The reaction was studied by both experiment and computation. Electrophile trapping and domino process led to the stereocontrolled preparation of tetrasubstituted alkylidene indenol derivatives. Additionally, preliminary results on challenging desymmetrizing carbolithiation mediated by an external chiral ligand of lithium are provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Theoretical Study on Si&#8210;Cl Bond Activation in Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Chlorosilanes with Organoaluminum</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic cross&#8208;coupling of chlorosilanes has recently emerged as an efficient method for the synthesis of organic silicon compounds. Direct Si&#8210;Cl bond activation by transition metals is a key elementary reaction in these methods. This theoretical study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of activation of the strong Si&#8210;Cl bond in Pd&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction to gain insights for rational catalyst design. Our results suggest two plausible pathways for the bond activation: (i)  trans  &#8208;oxidative addition and (ii) S  N  2&#8208;type oxidative addition assisted by a Lewis acid. With an increase in Cl substituents of chlorosilanes,  trans  &#8208;oxidative becomes highly feasible due to their higher Lewis acidities, in which the facile formation of the Pd&#8594;Si interaction enables the smooth activation of the Si&#8210;Cl bond. The general mechanism of direct Si&#8210;Cl bond activation presented here may prove useful for the rational design of catalysis in the future.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organoboronates are synthetically useful and highly valuable building blocks in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Two&#8208;electron reactions allow for the rapid construction of organoboronates via nucleophilic 1,2&#8208;boron shift of boron ate complexes or MIDA&#8208;mediated 1,2&#8208;boryl migration. Radical approaches through 1,2&#8208;boron shift of neutral boronic esters or boron ate complexes have been demonstrated to be feasible, providing complementary methods to access these privileged scaffolds. In this minireview, we highlight recent achievements and discuss future opportunities, with an emphasis on different operative modes of catalysis and reaction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Cascade Annulation Approach for Modular Assembly of Alkynyl/Benzoyl Functionalized Quinolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise and efficient method for the synthesis of alkynyl/benzoyl&#8208;functionalized quinolines through TfOH&#8208;promoted cascade 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition/intramolecular annulation/aromatization process is established.







Abstract
A concise and efficient synthetic method for alkynyl quinolines through TfOH&#8208;promoted cascade 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition/intramolecular annulation/aromatization process is established. By virtue of reactive aza&#8208;o&#8208;AQM (in&#8197;situ generated from modular propargylamine), this reaction proceeds smoothly to afford a variety of alkynyl quinolines in good to excellent yields. This transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free process features halogen groups tolerance, such as the &#8722;Cl, &#8722;Br, and &#8722;I groups; thus, this protocol circumvents the inherent shortcomings of the existing Sonogashira coupling of halogenated quinolines.

         <dc:description>An effective process for synthesizing 2&#8208;substituted indole in a one&#8208;pot tandem reaction of 1&#8208;halo&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzene and terminal alkynes through addition/reductive cyclization is presented. This protocol involves a Sonogashira type of coupling reaction followed by reductive cyclization employing dppf (1,1'&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene) ligated Pd dithiolate complex as a catalyst and Zn as an inexpensive reductant. This efficient and tandem process tolerates broad functional groups with moderate to good yields. The gram&#8208;scale synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted indole has also been demonstrated. This protocol provides an alternative route for the synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted indoles.</dc:description>

         <title>A Convenient Synthesis of Fluoroalkylated Benzimidazole&#8208; or Indole&#8208;fused Benzoxazines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluoroalkyl group is of particular interest in pharmaceutical chemistry. Since benzimidazole&#8208; or indole&#8208;fused benzoxazines are important motifs in numerous biologically active molecules, the incorporation of a fluoroalkyl group into these molecules may provide more opportunities for drug developments. Herein we describe the first synthesis of fluoroalkylated benzimidazole&#8208; or indole&#8208;fused benzoxazines by using fluoroalkylated propiolates as building blocks. The reactions proceeded smoothly under mild conditions to give the desired products in moderate to high yields. Notably, benzimidazole&#8208;fused products were obtained by a convenient one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step process.</dc:description>

         <title>A Mechanistic Study on the Non&#8208;enzymatic Hydrolysis of Kdn Glycosides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic reactivity of 4&#8208;nitrophenyl sialosides, which are substrates used to evaluate neuraminidase activity and selectivity, is shown to increase when the C5&#8208;substituent becomes sterically smaller (lower A&#8208;value), while electronic effects (Taft values) are less important for these hydrolysis reactions.







Abstract
Sialic acids are biologically important carbohydrates that are prevalent throughout nature. We are interested in their intrinsic reactivity in aqueous solution and how such reactivity affects the design of substrates for investigation of enzymes that process these sugars. To probe the reactivity differences between two sialic acid family members N&#8208;acetylneuraminic acid and Kdn we measured the rate constants for hydrolysis of 4&#8208;nitrophenyl 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;glycero&#8208;&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;galacto&#8208;non&#8208;2&#8208;ulosonide in aqueous solution. The kinetic data is consistent with glycosidic C&#8722;O bond cleavage occurring via four mechanistic pathways, and these are: (i) hydronium ion&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of the neutral sugar; (ii) hydronium ion&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of the glycosidic carboxylate; (iii) water&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of the anionic glycoside; and (iv) base&#8208;promoted reaction of the anionic glycoside. To study the effects of C&#8208;5 substitution on the Kdn glycoside we made 4&#8208;nitrophenyl 5&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Kdn glycoside and determined its rate constants for hydrolysis. All hydrolytic rate constants for both Kdn glycosides were larger than those reported for the parent N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;neuraminide. The water&#8208;catalyzed reaction (pathway iii) exhibited a &#946;lg value of &#8722;1.3&#177;0.1. We conclude that the larger rate constants associated with C5&#8208;oxygen containing sialosides results from less steric congestion at the hydrolytic transition states than for the parent C&#8208;5 acetamido glycoside.

&lt;p&gt;Sialic acids are biologically important carbohydrates that are prevalent throughout nature. We are interested in their intrinsic reactivity in aqueous solution and how such reactivity affects the design of substrates for investigation of enzymes that process these sugars. To probe the reactivity differences between two sialic acid family members &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylneuraminic acid and Kdn we measured the rate constants for hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl 3-deoxy-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;i&gt;glycero&lt;/i&gt;-&#945;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;i&gt;galacto&lt;/i&gt;-non-2-ulosonide in aqueous solution. The kinetic data is consistent with glycosidic C&#8722;O bond cleavage occurring via four mechanistic pathways, and these are: (i) hydronium ion-catalyzed hydrolysis of the neutral sugar; (ii) hydronium ion-catalyzed hydrolysis of the glycosidic carboxylate; (iii) water-catalyzed hydrolysis of the anionic glycoside; and (iv) base-promoted reaction of the anionic glycoside. To study the effects of C-5 substitution on the Kdn glycoside we made 4-nitrophenyl 5-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methyl-&#945;-Kdn glycoside and determined its rate constants for hydrolysis. All hydrolytic rate constants for both Kdn glycosides were larger than those reported for the parent &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-&#945;-neuraminide.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the pursuit of clean pharmaceutical production, chemists in the medicinal industry require access to new sustainable methodologies to reduce and even eliminate the pollution generation, which is mainly raised by the overuse of organic solvents, during the chemical synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). In this context, the solvent&#8208;free/less mechanochemical functionalization of small molecules has gradually emerged as a powerful strategy for the green synthesis and modification of APIs, bioactive compounds, and functional materials. In this minireview article, we present an overview of mechanochemical C&#8722;X/C&#8722;H functionalization applications to medicinal chemistry efforts, involving cross&#8208;coupling, cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling, oxidative coupling (via C&#8722;H activation pathway), and direct coupling (via radical pathway) as key steps for the preparation of APIs  and bioactive compounds  .</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A selective pinacol rearrangement of hydrobenzoin compounds was established via a heterogeneous catalysis strategy in the presence of cucurbit[7]uril. As an unexpected consequence, ketone was generated as the sole product with the cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;controlled hydride migration under optimized conditions. The five recycled runs suggested the catalytic activity of the cucurbit[7]uril remained. The experimental analysis and DFT calculation disclosed the important role of supramolecular encapsulation of substrates within the cavity of the macrocyclic host to fix the phenyl groups on hydrobenzoin compounds and trigger the hydride migration, therefore, ketone was the prior product.</dc:description>

         <title>Chasing polycyclic natural products: 5/6/5&#8208; or 5/6/6&#8208;carbotricyclic scaffold construction via stereodivergent Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of chiral hydrindanes and their boron complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral  trans&#8208;hydrindanes (bicyclo[4.3.0]nonanes) are important building blocks of polycyclic natural products. In order to access 5/6/5&#8208; and 5/6/6&#8208;carbotricyclic scaffolds scope and limitation of [4+2] cycloadditions of tetrahydroindanones with various dienes were studied. Cyclopentadiene gave a tetracylic  endo&#8208;(R,R)&#8208;diastereomer under acid&#8208;catalysis, whereas &#8232;thermal conditions provided the  endo&#8208;(S,S)&#8208;diastereomer with the opposite diastereofacial &#8232;selectivity. The stereodivergent outcome was rationalized by high&#8208;level quantum&#8208;chemical computations which revealed the acid&#8208;catalysis to be a kinetically controlled reaction and the thermal cycloaddition to be under thermodynamic control. Stereochemical assignment of the cycloadducts was facilitated by conversion of the 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls with BF3&#183;OEt2  into &#8232;BF2&#8208;chelate complexes. Subsequent thermal Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of BF2&#8208; or BBN&#8208;chelates (from 9&#8208;BBN&#8208;OTf) gave  endo  /  exo  &#8208;mixtures of the (R,R)&#8208; and (S,S)&#8208;diastereomers, while more elevated temperatures yielded primarily the  endo/exo&#8208;(S,S)&#8208;diastereomers. Thermal [4+2] cycloadditions with 2,3&#8208;dimethylbutadiene proceeded with lower diastereoselectivity as the &#8232;reaction was kinetically controlled according to calculations. Attempted Diels&#8208;Alder&#8208;reactions with furan gave furyl&#8208;substituted indanones rather than cycloadducts.</dc:description>

         <title>Combination of Asymmetric Organo&#8208; and Biocatalysis in Flow Processes and Comparison with their Analogous Batch Syntheses</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A sequential&#8208;type as well as a tandem&#8208;type chemoenzymatic flow cascade combining an organocatalytic aldol reaction and a biocatalytic reduction to form stereoselectively a 1,3&#8208;diol with two stereogenic centers were developed. Initially, a comprehensive screening of 24 alcohol dehydrogenases was carried out and the identified candidates were applied in different multi&#8208;step flow cascades. All four stereoisomers of the desired 1,3&#8208;diol product are accessible  via  a sequential flow approach with product formation&#8208;related conversions of up to 76% over two steps, isolated yields of up to 64% and enantiomeric excess of &gt;99% in all cases. In addition, a tandem&#8208;type flow process, performing both reaction steps simultaneously, was established leading to 51% conversion with &gt;99%  ee  and 8:1 d.r. and representing a combination of the fields of asymmetric chemocatalysis, biocatalysis and flow chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Substituted Malonic Acid Half Oxyesters (SMAHOs): Greener Nucleophiles for Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Substituted malonic acid half&#8208;oxyesters (SMAHOs) constitute an original family of malonic acid derivatives. They could be used as pro&#8208;nucleophiles through decarboxylative processes, making them enolate equivalents for the elaboration of greener methodologies. In addition to the native ester function, the presence of a substituent on the malonic position affords additional opportunities for structural diversification. These reagents are particularly well&#8208;suited for the development of organocatalyzed processes, which has recently led to olefination and addition reactions as relevant synthetic routes to elaborated structures under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article surveys the experimental and synthetic history of three classic antiaromatic cores: cyclobutadiene, borole, and pentalene. The coverage extends from the bare molecular cores to fused or substituted variants that impart thermodynamic or kinetic stability to the antiaromatic systems. Recent studies to utilize the unusual properties of these antiaromatic cores in the context of advanced electronic materials will be discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of pyranocyclopentaindolines representing the western sections of janthitrem B, JBIR&#8208;137, and shearinine G</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of the ABCD tetracyclic partial structures of the fungal indole diterpenes janthitrem B, JBIR&#8208;137, and shearinine G is reported. The route starts from 5&#8208;formylated indoline that is coupled to a dihydropyran moiety, followed by Prins cyclization. A diene was obtained that was oxygenated in a divergent manner. The hydroxylated tetracyclic western half of janthitrem B was obtained in eight steps and 10% overall yield. We also share our experience with alternative approaches passing via alkynylated precursors. This includes the gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of a 6&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;5&#8208;prenylindoline.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Dendrimer&#8208;Like Oligoguanidines and Their Use in a Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox&#8208;active organic dendrimers are of interest for a variety of applications, e.g. as components in optoelectronic devices and energy&#8208;storage (battery) materials, and were also used to model enzymatic reactivity. Here, we report the first synthesis of redox&#8208;active dendrimer&#8208;like oligoguanidines, assembling six or twelve guanidino groups attached to aromatic cores in one molecule. The novel oligoguanidines, being strong electron donors, are characterized in their stable (neutral and dicationic) redox states. Redox processes occur preferrentially at the core, while the periphery provides highly Br&#248;nsted basic sites. The combined electron and proton acceptor properties of the molecules in their stable oxidized dicationic redox state motivate applications in proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes. In this work, we test their application in a representative intramolecular oxidative aryl&#8208;aryl coupling reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Reactions Controlled by Ring&#8208;Chain Tautomerism of 2&#8208;Formylbenzoic Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) is an intensive area of research as it has found utility in the creation of molecular assemblies, complex systems, and ordered frameworks. Herein we demonstrate the development of dynamic covalent reactions (DCRs) of common N&#8208;, O&#8208;, and S&#8208;mononucleophiles by controlling ring&#8208;chain tautomerism of 2&#8208;formylbenzoic acid. The regulation of distinct dual reactivity of interconverting open aldehyde and cyclic hemiacetal forms, the thermodynamic stabilization through chelation and delocalization, as well as the kinetic effect resulting from neighboring group participation, enabled the realization of DCRs of a broad range of alcohols, thiols, primary amines, and secondary amines exhibiting high efficiency and fast equilibrium. The dynamic nature of the system was verified through component exchange, and the switch of DCRs was achieved through the manipulation of substrate selectivity. The investigation of mechanism shed insights on the dependence of reaction pathways on nucleophiles, laying the foundation for future design and application.</dc:description>

         <title>An Improved Protocol for the Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman Reaction Allows Unprecedented Broad Synthetic Scope</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) reaction has been stablished as an important C&#8211;C bond&#8208;forming transformation between carbonyl&#8208;containing compounds and activated olefins. However, the slow reaction rate usually observed with electron&#8208;rich electrophilic partners hinders a more widespread use of this reaction. In order to overcome this drawback, the effects of several Br&#248;nsted acids on the rate of DABCO&#8208;catalyzed MBH reactions were evaluated. The protocol is operationally simple, involving neat and open&#8208;flask conditions, and is compatible with a wide range of reagents. We suggest a general acid catalysis mechanism to be responsible for the rate increase. The synthetic versatility of the MBH adducts is exemplified with a two&#8208;steps diastereoselective synthesis of the natural product (&#177;)&#8208;sitophilure. We hope this acid&#8208;mediated protocol to have potential use as a general methodology for the MBH reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>A Molecular Electron Density Theory Study of the Lewis Acid Catalyzed [3+2] Cycloaddition Reactions of Nitrones with Nucleophilic Ethylenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The BF  3  Lewis acid (LA) catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition (32CA) reaction of 1&#8208;pyrroline&#8208;1oxide (PNO) with 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran (DHF) has been studied within the molecular electron density theory (MEDT) at the &#969;B97X&#8208;D/6&#8208;311G(d,p) computational level. Electron localization function (ELF) characterizes PNO and the corresponding PNO:BF  3  complex as zwitterionic species. Conceptual DFT indices allow classifying PNO and DHF as marginal electrophiles and strong nucleophiles, while the PNO:BF  3  complex is a strong electrophile. Consequently, while the non&#8208;catalyzed 32CA reaction is non&#8208;polar, the BF  3  catalyzed one has a high polar character, revealed by the analysis of the global electron density transfer (GEDT) at the transition state structures. The BF  3  catalyzed 32CA reaction, which is classified as of reverse electron density flux (REDF), presents high  exo  stereoselectivity, and total  ortho  regioselectivity. The presence of the BF  3  catalyst decreases the activation enthalpy of the 32CA reaction in dichloromethane by 7.5 kcal mol  &#8208;1  , as a consequence of the increase of the polar character of the reaction, in complete agreement with the experimentally observed acceleration.</dc:description>

         <title>Silk Fibroin&#8208;Supported Palladium Catalyst for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura and Ullmann Coupling Reactions of Aryl Chlorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently we reported the preparation of a silk fibroin&#8208;supported Palladium catalyst (Pd/SF) and its use in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of aryl iodides. Since its synthetic applicability and structural features are still far from being fully explored, a deeper investigation is reported here. Pd/SF is tested as a catalyst for the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura and Ullmann coupling reactions of aryl chlorides, in H2O/EtOH solvent mixture under atmospheric conditions. Starting from the analysis of the products of the Pd/SF promoted Ullmann reactions of poly&#8208;haloarenes, we can hypothesize the existence of catalytic pockets where monoatomic palladium species can form stable complexes with SF. To shed light on this hypothesis, Pd/SF is characterized by Wide&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering (WAXS) analysis, which supports the supposition of catalytic pockets. Finally, using a computational model developed by Molecular Mechanic Energy Minimization we have estimated the dimension of the catalytic pocket of Pd/SF (about 15 &#197;), in good agreement with the experimental results.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This paper describes the stepwise aza&#8208;Wittig reaction of 1,1&#162;&#8208;bis(triphenylphosphoranylidenamino)&#8208;ferrocene with a paramagnetic isocyanate, namely, 3&#8208;isocyanato&#8208;2,2,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl, and then with substituted arylisocyanates. The intermediate product (a paramagnetic betaine), which is the product of an intramolecular nucleophilic attack of the nitrogen atom of the iminophosphorane moiety on the carbon atom of the carbodiimide functional group, was isolated and structurally characterized. Subsequent interaction of the betaine with arylisocyanates under mild conditions gave spin&#8208;labeled ferrocenophanes with the 1,3&#8208;diazetidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diimine coupler. It was found that the mutual arrangement of the substituents in the latter depends on the nature of the substituents in the arylisocyanate. Iodophenyl derivatives of 1,3&#8208;diazetidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diimines were cross&#8208;coupled with the gold(I) nitronyl nitroxide&#8208;2&#8208;ide complex, thus yielding diradicals: metallocenophanes functionalized with various types of nitroxide substituents. Molecular and crystal structures of all mono&#8208; and diradicals were solved by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding and transport properties of a benzo[b]thiophene&#8208;based mono&#8208;(thio)urea library</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using the chemical versatility of the benzo[ b ]thiophene motif, an extensive library of 24 (thio)urea receptors, with different binding properties and lipophilicities was prepared and included &#945;,&#945;&#8208;, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;, &#946;,&#946;&#8208;, &#946;,&#947;&#8208;, &#945;,&#947;&#8208;, and &#947;,&#947;&#8208;benzo[ b ]thiophene positional isomers, as well as &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;benzo[ b ]thiophene&#8208;based molecules decorated with aliphatic chains or aryl moieties with different fluorination degrees. 1 H NMR titrations, X&#8208;ray crystallography studies, and DFT calculations showed that the receptors with higher chloride binding affinities were the &#946;,&#946;&#8208; and &#947;,&#947;&#8208;bis&#8208;benzo[ b ]thiophene and fluorinated aryl &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;benzo[ b ]thiophene derivatives that synergistically bind chloride with the urea and one or two C &#946;/&#947; &#8208;H ancillary binding groups. Experimental efflux studies showed that, among these small drug&#8208;like molecules, only the highly fluorinated analogues displayed anion transmembrane transport activity, suggesting that this property is dependent on the receptors' lipophilicity and hydrogen bonding ability. Moreover, LUV based assays, undertaken under electroneutral and electrogenic conditions, together with NMDG&#8208;Cl assays, indicated that anion efflux occurs mainly through an uniport mechanism. Further MD simulations showed that anion transport is highly dependent on the orientation and interactions of the receptors at the water/lipid interface.</dc:description>

Moreover, LUV based assays, undertaken under electroneutral and electrogenic conditions, together with NMDG-Cl assays, indicated that anion efflux occurs mainly through an uniport mechanism. Further MD simulations showed that anion transport is highly dependent on the orientation and interactions of the receptors at the water/lipid interface.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solid&#8208;phase synthesis of macrocyclic peptides via side&#8208;chain anchoring of the ornithine &#948;&#8208;amine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic peptides represent a popular class of macrocyclic drug candidates and therefore their solid phase synthesis has attracted much attention. In this contribution we present an efficient method of side&#8208;chain anchoring for ornithine and lysine residues to be used in the standard Fmoc&#8208;based synthesis of cyclic peptides via on&#8208;resin cyclization. We demonstrate that the side chain of ornithine and lysine protected with  N  &#8208;Boc&#8208;group can efficiently be converted to the isocyanate which is then immobilized on Wang&#8208;type resin in almost quantitative yield. We further show the synthesis of four biologically active cyclic peptides employing the side chain ornithine anchoring. Our method is at least on a par with the previously reported methodologies in terms of yield and the purity of the final products and is arguably operationally more straightforward.</dc:description>

         <title>SNAr Isocyanide Diversification</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast method for the easy access of 4&#8208;amino substituted 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;phenyl isocyanides was developed under room temperature with moderate to high yields. The products are very reactive in a number of tested typical multicomponent reactions.







Abstract
Isocyanides are important building blocks in organic synthesis; however, their synthesis is time and resource consuming and often unpleasant due to their smelly nature. Diversification of isocyanides can be accomplished by de novo synthesis or from already existing isocyanides. In this work, we report for the first&#8208;time isocyanide diversification based on nucleophilic aromatic substitution of suitable precursor isocyanides. The mild conditions allow for easy access to multiple novel isocyanides useful in organic synthesis. The resulting isocyanides are solid and non&#8208;noxious, yet react nicely in multicomponent reactions.

         <title>2&#8208; and 6&#8208;Purinylmagnesium Halides in Dichloromethane: Scope and New Insights into the Solvent Influence on the C&#8722;Mg Bond</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly functionalized purine systems were obtained using aldehydes and, for the first time, ketones through a recently developed iodo&#8208;Mg exchange methodology that works in DCM. DFT calculations suggested that the observed major stability of the C&#8722;Mg bond generated in DCM at higher temperature compared to the one in THF might be derived from a less polar character of the C&#8722;Mg bond in such non&#8208;coordinating solvent.







Abstract
The generation of positionally stable purin&#8208;2&#8208; and 6&#8208;yl magnesium halides is complicated by the often very rapid isomerization to give the 8&#8208;yl Grignards. By conducting the reaction in dichloromethane (DCM), we demonstrated that the anion isomerization can be stopped and these stable purin&#8208;2&#8208; and 6&#8208;yl Grignards react directly with a broad scope of aldehydes in good yields. Furthermore, purine functionalization with ketones has been achieved for the first time in the presence of LaCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2LiCl. Density functional theory calculations offer a possible explanation of the special role played by solvent in this chemistry and show that in DCM the C&#8722;Mg bond has a less polar character, whereas in THF it is predominantly ionic and much more basic in nature.

         <title>Organocatalytic asymmetric double addition of kojic acids to 2&#8208;nitroallylic carbonates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;Nitroallylic carbonates were first applied as promising bis&#8208;electrophilic C  3  synthons for bifunctional squaramide catalyzed asymmetric domino reaction with kojic acid derivatives to afford so far inaccessible nitro compounds bearing two hydroxypyranone units. The reaction products undergo non&#8208;catalytic epimerization at the carbon atom next to the nitro group. Plausible mechanism of the epimerization based on reversible formation of intermediate  aci  &#8208;nitro compound is proposed. The double addition products were transformed to configurationally stable acetates and to chiral nitro glutarates, promising precursors to chiral amino glutaric acid derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Entrectinib with Key Photo&#8208;Redox Mediated Cross&#8208;Coupling in Flow</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The newly marketed drug entrectinib was synthesized in 6 steps using photo&#8208;redox in flow as the key C&#8722;N bond forming step. Through investigating various substrates for the C&#8722;N coupling in flow it was discovered that more electron&#8208;poor aryl halides perform optimally in the coupling step. Through varying residence time, temperature, and catalyst loadings tools to reduce hydro&#8208;dehalogenation were discovered.







Abstract
By using photo&#8208;redox catalysis in flow the newly marketed drug entrectinib (referred to by the brand name Rozlytrek) was synthesized in 6 linear steps from readily available building blocks under mild conditions. Evaluation of multiple intermediates for their use in the critical C&#8722;N amination step in flow led to the finding that more electron deficient aryl&#8208;halides achieve higher conversion to the desired product. Data supports that more electron rich aryl&#8208;halides undergo a significant amount of hydro&#8208;dehalogenation compared to the productive C&#8722;N bond formation. Through evaluating various entry points into the synthesis of entrectinib, shorter routes were identified albeit in low yields. The modularity of this route will allow chemists to rapidly synthesize a diverse library of compounds through this route. Via different synthetic intermediates, a scale&#8208;up route was discovered for the synthesis of entrectinib using photo&#8208;redox in flow in less steps than previously reported, highlighting the utility of flow chemistry in the pharmaceutical industry.

         <title>Template Synthesis of Novel Norcorrole Complexes with a Phenyl&#8208;substituted Phosphorus Center</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel norcorrole complexes with a phenyl&#8208;substituted phosphorus center were synthesized as the new examples of norcorrole main&#8208;group element complexes. These phosphorus complexes were found to have aromaticity resulting from the peripheral 18&#8208;electron &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. Moreover, the phenyl&#8208;substituted phosphorus complex exhibited unique optical properties such as a stronger Q&#8208;band than Soret&#8208;band and a fluorescent emission with significantly small Stokes shift.







Abstract
Novel norcorroles complexes with a phenyl&#8208;substituted phosphorus center were synthesized by a template method and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction. It was proved that these new norcorrole phosphorus complexes have aromaticity similar to the very recently reported norcorrole complex with a methoxy&#8208;substituted phosphorus center. This aromaticity results from the peripheral 18&#960;&#8208;system consisting of two methine carbons and four amine&#8208;type pyrrole units with formally pentavalent phosphorus center. On the other hand, these phenyl&#8208;substituted phosphorus complexes showed quite characteristic and strong Q&#8208;band derived from less symmetricity of the molecules than other porphyrinoids.

Cascade reaction of MBH bromides with tosyliminoindolines occurs with regio&#8208; as well as diastereoselectivity in a formal [3+3] manner to form various tetrahydro&#8208;  &#945;  &#8208;carbolines with wide substrate scope under mild conditions. All the products were obtained in high yields within a short reaction time. Also, the synthetic efficiency of the methodology was demonstrated by a gram scale experiment and by further converting them into 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;  &#945;&#8208;  carbolines.</dc:description>

         <title>The First Total Synthesis of Racemic Chebulic Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first total synthesis of racemic chebulic acid is reported, which is the aglycon of several antioxidant ingredients of the fruit of the  Terminalia chebula  tree. The route started with the straightforward preparation of an indanone&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;oxoester from a benzaldehyde derivative (84% over the first five steps). The side chain of the target compound was then introduced by conjugated addition of a cuprate reagent derived from dimethyl succinate, which was followed by the first key step of the synthesis: a cerium&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of an &#946;&#8208;oxoester. The second key step was the cyanide&#8208;catalyzed ring transformation of the cyclic &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoester to a &#948;&#8208;lactone. This is a new reaction which has been recently developed in our laboratories. Finally, chebulic acid was obtained after six&#8208;fold demethylation of three methyl ester moieties and three phenolic ether functions. The overall synthetic route consists of nine consecutive steps and was accomplished in 15% overall yield. Both, the synthetic, racemic product as well the natural, optically active material consist of the same two diastereoisomers (2:1  dr  ).</dc:description>

         <title>PAHs Containing both Heptagon and Pentagon: Corannulene Extension by [5+2] Annulation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general synthetic method based on hydroboration, electrophilic borylation, dehydrogenation and [5+2] annulation affords molecules with both bowl&#8208; and saddle&#8208;shape and the inclusion of a formal azulene unit. Their optical and electronic properties were studied to elucidate the ramifications of different substituents. Furthermore, their aromaticity was assessed through theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Utilizing Pd&#8208;catalyzed [5+2] annulation a series of heptagon&#8208;extended corannulenes could be synthesized from a borinic acid precursor furnished by C&#8722;H borylation strategy. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed the presence of two conformational enantiomers crystallizing in a racemic mixture. Through their embedded five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered rings these polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) exhibit both negative and positive curvature and UV/Vis/NIR absorption spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry experiments provided insights into the influence of larger flanking aromatic systems and electron&#8208;donating substituents encompassing the heptagonal ring. Through [5+2] annulation of acenaphthylene an azulene&#8208;containing PAH with intriguing optoelectronical properties including a very small bandgap and absorption over the whole visible spectrum could be obtained. Theoretical calculations were employed to elucidate the long&#8208;wavelength absorption and aromaticity.

         <title>Synthesis and Studies of Potential Inhibitors of CD73 Based on a Triazole Scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several series of substituted 1,4,5&#8208;triazole derivatives bearing various aryls, alkyls and indoles groups were synthetized, as inhibitors of 5&#8242;&#8208;ectonucleotidase CD73, and evaluated for their potential inhibitory effect on purified recombinant hCD73 enzyme and in cell&#8208;based assays. Among them, some compounds were found to be potent enzymatic inhibitors at 10&#8197;&#956;M.







Abstract
The ecto&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;nucleotidase CD73 is involved in the production of immunosuppressive adenosine in the tumoral microenvironment and recently became a validated target in immuno&#8208;oncology. To avoid formation of CD73&#8208;produced adenosine, several series of potential inhibitors of the target enzyme based on a triazole scaffold were synthetized and evaluated on recombinant purified hCD73 and in cell&#8208;based assays.

         <title>Photochemistry at Scale: Wireless Light Emitters Drive Sustainability in Process Research &amp; Development</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our study demonstrates a seamless scale&#8208;up of photochemical C&#8722;C&#8208;cross&#8208;couplings of aryls and alkyls via dual Ir/Ni photoredox catalysis. The herein described novel type of internal illumination using wirelessly powered LEDs inside the reaction media allows for efficient scaling and intensification of those reactions, maintaining virtually identical reaction profiles over all scales. The system is readily applicable to other light&#8208;driven reactions as well.







Abstract
Carbon&#8722;carbon bond formation by dual Iridium&#8208;Nickel photoredox catalysis has gained a lot of attention for late&#8208;stage cross&#8208;couplings of alkyls with aryls. However, the scalability of such reactions is greatly impeded by the poor light penetration depth into the strongly absorbing reaction media. Wireless internal illumination is a novel technique which circumvents the light penetration issue efficiently and therefore allows to scale photon&#8208;driven reactions by conventional methods. Here we demonstrate that industrially relevant photoredox C&#8722;C couplings can be scaled seamlessly to different volumes, achieving qualitatively and quantitatively the same results at all scales. The use of conventional reactor types allows stirred, bubble column or fixed&#8208;bed operation mode and is fully compatible with heterogeneous reaction mixtures. By minimizing reflection losses, we could also show a significant advantage in the reaction rate over an externally illuminated setup at the same light intensity.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Dicarbofunctionalization of Unactivated Alkenes: Synthesis of Fluoroalkylated Heterocycles with All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Centers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The redox&#8208;neutral Pd&#8208;catalyzed dicarbofunctionalization of unactivated alkenes with a variety of functionalized perfluoroalkyl halide is presented. This transformation enables the assembly of diversified fluoroalkylated pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoles with one all&#8208;carbon quaternary center in high regioselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggest the generation of perfluoroalkyl radicals from the single electron reduction of palladium(0) to perfluoroalkyl halides.







Abstract
The redox&#8208;neutral palladium&#8208;catalyzed dicarbofunctionalization of unactivated alkenes with a variety of functionalized difluoromethyl and perfluoroalkyl halide is presented here. This transformation proceeds smoothly at low temperatures and enables the assembly of diversified fluoroalkylated pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indole derivatives with one all&#8208;carbon quaternary center in high regioselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggested an operative radical mechanism and the initiation of the inner&#8208;sphere single electron transfer between a dual phosphine ligand&#8208;coordinated palladium(0) species and perfluoroalkyl halides.

         <title>Trapping Experiments during Reductive Debrominations of Aminotribromosilanes with Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive debrominations of the tribromosilanes {N(SiMe3)2}SiBr3 (3) and {N(SiMe3)Dipp}SiBr3 (4) with Mg* in the presence of ethylene revealed the occurrence of transient amido&#8208;substituted disilynes (1) and (2) via the corresponding cycloaddition products. This was confirmed by using 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene in the reductive debromination of (4) that yields the disilabicyclo[2.2.0]hexane (7). Using 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene as trapping agent in the reaction of (4) with Mg* showed that a cyclotrisilene was generated during the reduction.







Abstract
In&#8208;situ generated amido&#8208;substituted disilynes (SiMe3)2N&#8722;Si&#8801;Si&#8722;N(SiMe3)2 1 and (SiMe3)DippN&#8722;Si&#8801;Si&#8722;N(SiMe3)Dipp 2 were observed examined upon the reductive dehalogenation of the tribromosilanes {N(SiMe3)2}SiBr3 3 and {N(SiMe3)Dipp}SiBr3 4 with Rieke magnesium (Mg*). Both disilynes were trapped with ethylene to yield the double [2+1] and [2+2] cycloaddition products 5 and 6, respectively. The transient disilynes 1 and 2 were investigated with DFT calculations that revealed 1 to feature more triple bond character than 2. The in&#8208;situ generated disilyne 2 was further quenched with 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene to yield the double [2+2] cycloaddition product 7. In the presence of cyclooctatetraene, the reductive debromination of 4 with Mg* generates the bromo&#8208;substituted silacyclopentene 8. This species was also isolated with 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene used as trapping reagent as the major product 9, besides the side product 10, that comprises two cyclotrisilene rings linked via a butene unit. The formation of 10 shows that a cyclotrisilene can occur as a side product during the reductive debromination of 4 in the presence of the alkene.

&lt;p&gt;Reductive debrominations of the tribromosilanes {N(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}SiBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (3) and {N(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)Dipp}SiBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (4) with Mg* in the presence of ethylene revealed the occurrence of transient amido-substituted disilynes (1) and (2) via the corresponding cycloaddition products. This was confirmed by using 1,5-cyclooctadiene in the reductive debromination of (4) that yields the disilabicyclo[2.2.0]hexane (7). Using 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene as trapping agent in the reaction of (4) with Mg* showed that a cyclotrisilene was generated during the reduction.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed N1 Coupling of 3&#8208;Aminoindazoles and Related Aminoazoles with Aryl Bromides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coupling between 3&#8208;aminoindazoles and aryl bromides, selectively occurring at the N1 position, was developed using copper catalysis. The transformation allows the use of a variety of heterocycles for both coupling partners and provides rapid access to arylated aminoazoles of high interest in drug discovery.







Abstract
The N1&#8208;selective arylation of 3&#8208;aminoindazoles using copper catalysis is herein reported. The reaction uses readily accessible aryl bromides as coupling partners, including those from heterocycles, and allows easy access to a broad variety of substituted 3&#8208;aminoindazoles. The methodology was also examined on other aminoazoles of interest for the pharmaceutical industry.

Abstract
A novel approach for the synthesis of 2&#8208;arylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones was developed. A series of title compounds were obtained with good functional group tolerance and good yields by I2/DMSO&#8208;mediated intramolecular oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;(benzylamino)benzamides to form C=N double bonds. This method was applicable for gram&#8208;scale synthesis. A proposed reaction pathway based on some control experiments was also provided.

         <title>Primary Amine Catalyzed Activation of Carbonyl Compounds: A Study on Reaction Pathways and Reactive Intermediates by Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Offline ESI&#8208;MS experiments can be easily pursuit to select optimal (catalyst, cocatalyst, reaction time, reagent amounts) working conditions for the primary amines catalyzed activation of carbonyl compounds. Combining MS and MSn experiments with enantioselective HPLC analysis, the catalytic cycle together with its active (typically enamine or iminium ions) intermediates and the stereochemical induction processes were elucidated.







Abstract
The field of organocatalysis is expanding at a fast pace. Its growth is sustained by major stimuli, such as the effort toward an understanding of the mechanisms of reaction and catalytic processes in general, the elucidation of basic properties leading to stereocontrol and the search for broad applicability and scalability of the synthetic methodology. This paper reports a thorough study based on ESI&#8208;MS spectrometry of amino&#8208;organocatalyzed model reactions under different experimental conditions. Off&#8208;line reaction monitoring of mixtures containing different catalytic systems, by ESI&#8208;MSn showed the presence of several putative intermediate species, either in their protonated or sodiated forms. In addition, enantioselective chromatography of crude reactions provides the stereochemical outcome of asymmetric reactions. The bulk of the data collected offers a clue of the intricate pathways occurring in solution for the studied reactions.

         <title>On the Shape and Synthesis of Extended Fluorenones: Recent Advances and Upcoming Challenges</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective synthesis of tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208; and octa&#8208;cyclic extended fluorenones and their topological diversity. This Review provides an overview of the literature up to March 2021.







Abstract
Extended fluorenones represent a particular class of polycyclic compounds. The extension of the aromatic system through the fusion of additional benzene rings onto the central tricyclic fluorenone gives rise to an impressive topological diversity and allows to modulate the properties of the original molecule. The multiple ways this aromatic extension can be joined onto the tricyclic core generates multiple spatial arrangements from linear, angular, mixed linear&#8208;angular, to helical. This extensive range of shapes and their subsequent applications has piqued the curiosity of the scientific community, who now creatively compete to develop selective and direct routes to these valuable molecular architectures. Potential applications of these diverse domains have also driven the development of strategies for the installation of various substituents at selected sites of the carbon backbone. This Review intends to provide the reader with an up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of the methods for constructing extended fluorenones and their properties.

A complete computational study has been performed in order to rationalise the results of a new organocatalytic approach to the kinetic resolution of 4&#8208;substituted oxazinones which results in highly enantioenriched and orthogonally&#8208;protected &#946;&#8208;amino acids. DFT&#8208;analysis elucidated the preferable binding orientation of the 4&#8208;oxazinone under study, predicted the formation of the observed major R product with a calculated ee in good agreement with the experimental data and allowed a complete mechanistic and stereochemical understanding of the catalysis. The alcoholytic kinetic resolution of a 7&#8208;memebered ring analogue to generate enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;amino acids was experimentally and computationally investigated for the first time.

&lt;p&gt;DFT study of a new effective approach to obtain orthogonally protected &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-amino acids via the kinetic resolution of oxazinones has been performed. From the computational study, the orientations of the reactants and the mechanism have been elucidated.

&lt;p&gt;A complete computational study has been performed in order to rationalise the results of a new organocatalytic approach to the kinetic resolution of 4-substituted oxazinones which results in highly enantioenriched and orthogonally-protected &#946;-amino acids. DFT-analysis elucidated the preferable binding orientation of the 4-oxazinone under study, predicted the formation of the observed major &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; product with a calculated &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt; in good agreement with the experimental data and allowed a complete mechanistic and stereochemical understanding of the catalysis. The alcoholytic kinetic resolution of a 7-memebered ring analogue to generate enantioenriched &lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-amino acids was experimentally and computationally investigated for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Hexagonal Shape&#8208;Persistent Nanobelt of Elongated Rhombic Symmetry with Orthogonal &#960;&#8208;Planes by a One&#8208;Pot Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triptycenes with their predefined D 3h &#8208;symmetry are excellent molecular building blocks to construct shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles having &#960;&#8208;orbitals orthogonal to the ring plane. However, up to now, there are only a very few examples of fused and rigid iptycene macrocycles synthesized in several consecutive steps in overall yields below 1%. Here we present the simple one&#8208;step one&#8208;pot approach to an iptycene nanobelt, which forms in &gt;2% and can readily isolated from the polymeric by&#8208;product by gel&#8208;permeation chromatography.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of azido&#8208;dienediols by enzymatic dioxygenation of benzylazides: an experimental and theoretical study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allylic azides are a versatile structural motif in organic synthesis because the proximal double bond enables a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement, named as the Winstein rearrangement. In this manuscript an experimental and theoretical study on the double Winstein rearrangement occurring in azidodienediols derived from the biocatalytic dihydroxylation of substituted benzylazides is presented. Substrates bearing a methyl group in  ortho  or  meta  position produced exclusively rearranged exo&#8208;diendiols with the azide group  anti  to the diol moiety as the major constituent. In the case of  para  methyl substrates, an equilibrium mixture of rearranged and non&#8208;rearranged products was observed, indicating that a full conversion to the exo&#8208;dienediols is not possible within this substitution pattern. On the other hand, the presence of a chloro substituent in the diene moiety completely precluded the Winstein rearrangement to take place, giving rise exclusively to the traditional  cis  &#8208;cyclohexadienediols. The observed results were analyzed to determine the mechanistic and kinetic aspects and scope limitations of the reaction as a synthetic tool.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The polyenoyltetramic acids pyranonigrin J (3) and py&#173;ranonigrin I (4) had been isolated from Aspergillus niger.

We corroborated this stereochemical assignment after ex&#173;ecuting the first total syntheses of both compounds because they had es&#173;sentially the same specific rotations as their natural coun&#173;ter&#173;parts. Our syntheses used the &#946;&#8208;ketothioester 18 as a con&#173;junctive re&#173;a&#173;gent.

         <title>Direct Access to Unique C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;Acyl Modified Nucleosides through Liebeskind&#8211;Srogl Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient palladium/CuTC cocatalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction procedure for the synthesis of C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;acyl nucleosides from the corresponding nucleoside 5&#8242;&#8208;carbothioates and boronic acids is described. The procedure is fast, efficient, and it tolerates a wide variety of functionalities, thus expanding the so far limited chemical methods for C&#8208;5&#8217; diversification of deoxy&#8208; and ribonucleosides.







Abstract
The chemical functionalization at C&#8208;5&#8217; position of nucleosides has been significantly less studied compared to the C&#8208;1&#8217;, C&#8208;2&#8217; and C&#8208;3&#8217; sugar positions in spite of its potential important role for biological activity. We describe here the synthesis of new carbothioate nucleosides which were then engaged in a Liebeskind&#8208;Srogl reaction with various boronic acids for the preparation of diversely modified C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;acyl nucleosides. Applied to pyrimidine nucleosides in the DNA and RNA series, the reaction showed a broad substrate scope and more than 25 examples were synthesized in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent isolated yields. This general and efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed and Cu(I)&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;coupling represents a convenient method to prepare a diverse set of 5&#8217;&#8208;modified nucleosides and paves the way for further transformation into a variety of potentially bioactive compounds via the possible conversion of the C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;ketone.

&lt;p&gt;An efficient palladium/CuTC cocatalyzed cross-coupling reaction procedure for the synthesis of C-5&#8217;-acyl nucleosides from the corresponding nucleoside 5&#8242;-carbothioates and boronic acids is described. The procedure is fast, efficient, and it tolerates a wide variety of functionalities, thus expanding the so far limited chemical methods for C-5&#8217; diversification of deoxy- and ribonucleosides.

         <dc:description>The first continuous flow syntheses of sulfur&#8208; and selenium&#8208;NHC (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) adducts in unprecedented short reaction times and high yields are reported.

Thiourea derivatives bearing both saturated and unsaturated NHCs were obtained using NEt  3  as a weak base (homogeneous setup) in conjunction with a bed of elemental sulfur (S  8  ). The synthetic route proving optimum for selenoureas involves the use of a simple Se/K  2  CO  3  heterogeneous microreactor design.</dc:description>

         <title>Discrepancy Regarding the Dethreading of a Dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 Macrocycle through a Perfluorobutyl End in [2]Pseudorotaxanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and dethreading study of DB24C8&#8208;based pseudorotaxanes are reported. The pseudorotaxane axles contain ammonium and carbamate stations as well as a repulsive nonafluorobutyl group as one of the two extremities. This extremity prevents any threading of the DB24C8. However, dethreading of pseudorotaxanes is possible and the kinetic rate depends on the presence and localization in the encircled axle of secondary sites of interactions (carbamates).







Abstract
Here are reported the synthesis and characterization of four new dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8)&#8208;based ammonium&#8208;containing pseudorotaxanes, for which one of the two encircled axle's extremities consists of a perfluorobutyl moiety. The subsequent dethreading of the DB24C8 over the perfluorobutyl extremity was studied. Although the perfluorobutyl extremity of an ammonium&#8208;containing axle did not allow threading of DB24C8, dethreading of a perfluorobutyl extremity&#8208;containing pseudorotaxane was possible and its rate depended on both the strength of the template&#8208;to&#8208;DB24C8 complex and the nature of the axle. In particular, dethreading process may be assisted by the presence, in the threaded axle, of a poor secondary site of interaction for the DB24C8 and this assistance proved to be higher when this site is close to the DB24C8.

         <title>Construction of benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles by epoxide &#8211; heteronucleophile cyclization: applications in the synthesis of natural products and designed molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Construction of benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles, specifically which have one or more sp  3  stereogenic carbon atoms on the heterocyclic ring, by intramolecular ring&#8208;opening cyclization of epoxides with  O  &#8208; and  N  &#8208;nucleophiles is a powerful synthetic tool in organic synthesis. In this review, we analyze the efficiency of such a heterocyclization approach in natural product synthesis and synthetic methodologies published since the year 2000. In addition to briefly discussing the synthetic methods of accessing the requisite epoxide substrates, important aspects of the subsequent cyclization reaction, such as reaction conditions,  endo  &#8208; versus  exo  &#8208;regioselectivity, protecting or functional group compatibility, and enantio&#8208; and distereoselectivity are analysed. Noteworthy is that although the literature of organic chemistry in the last four decades has witnessed a large number of reviews/book chapters on epoxide ring&#8208;opening chemistry, this is the first time that the current topic is systematized as a dedicated review.</dc:description>

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Synthesis of a Hexapeptide by Fragment Coupling in a Ball Mill</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using solvent&#8208;less techniques such as ball milling, a hexapeptide was synthesized in gram scale without using any toxic solvents. To date, this hexapeptide is the largest precisely controlled amino acid sequence ever synthesized in a ball mill. This study paves the way to future developments for the synthesis of longer peptides (and proteins) by using ball milling.







Abstract
Synthesis of long peptides is generally considered as a challenge to peptide chemists, in addition to producing significant amounts of toxic waste, such as DMF. Here we show that using solvent&#8208;less methods, such as ball milling, enabled the production of the hexapeptide Boc&#8208;(Ala&#8208;Phe&#8208;Gly)2&#8208;OBn at the gram scale with high overall yield (77&#8201;%, 5 linear steps). This is the longest peptide chain synthesized in a ball mill to date, in which the amino acid sequence is precisely controlled. This study complements the current fundamental knowledge required to synthesize longer and more difficult peptide chains (or small proteins) by using peptide fragment couplings in a ball mill.

         <title>A 2000 to 2020 Practitioner&#8217;s Guide to Chiral Amine Based Enantioselective Aldol Reactions:Common Ketone Substrates,Best Methods,in Water Reaction Environments,and Defining Nuances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We begin with an extensive introduction for the non&#8208;expert regarding enantioselective, amine catalyzed, aldol reactions (Sections 1&#8208;3). There, a broad prospective is provided regarding: methodology limitations, mechanism, in water versus on water definitions and their theoretical basis, small&#8208; and large&#8208;scale physical&#8208;mechanical aspects, solid versus liquid starting material considerations, reproducibility, ball milling, diketone substrates, etc. The thematic emphasis then turns to practical outcomes for the reaction of nineteen aliphatic, cyclic, and aromatic ketones with 4&#8208;nitrobenzaldehyde and benzaldehyde prior to 2021. The ketone substrates are listed in Section 4 of the TOC and their structures are shown in Figure 1. Each ketone is linked to a summary defined by a: (i) schematic, (ii) text summary, (iii) catalyst Figures, and (iv) tabular reaction/product data. Individual ketone summaries, at times, represent the distillation of over six hundred research articles, and the data refinement and its tabular reconstitution is not reproducible using a chemical database search with filters. In the review&#8217;s broadest use, the Figure 1 ketone structures serve as templates to extrapolate to a hypothetical substrate holding more functionality, but of related steric and electronic similarity. This pseudo matching permits a rapid answer to, &#8220;Does this methodology suit the ketone substrate at hand or not?&#8221; In a positive outcome, the best reaction conditions (stoichiometry, catalyst structure and loading, solvent, time, etc.) to affect aldol product formation (yield, dr, and ee) are delineated. A second envisioned use allows the directed construction of diketone substrates (after viewing the tabularized data of Section 4), which then undergo regioselective mono&#8208;aldol product formation. This tactic, reacting one carbonyl moiety while the other remains unreacted, avoids ketone protection&#8208;deprotection, and is shown for the advantageous synthesis of an Alzheimer drug candidate.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein&#8208;Polymer Bioconjugates Prepared by Post&#8208;Polymerization Modification of Alternating Copolymers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward strategy is proposed for the synthesis of protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugates using one of the oldest polymers, the poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride). Different poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) copolymers were successfully prepared by RAFT polymerization in dioxane using the 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;propyl dodecyl trithiocarbonate as chain transfer agent (CTA) and AIBN as initiator. Original biomacromolecules were successfully prepared by post&#8208;polymerization modification.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugates have shown great promise in biomedical and life science applications including drug delivery and diagnosis. The current bioconjugation strategies suffer from lack of efficiency and versatility. In this article, poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) copolymers were first prepared by RAFT polymerization and characterized by different analytical techniques. Then, the poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) precursors were functionalized with primary amine such as azidopropylamine and amino poly(ethylene glycol). The reaction of amino compounds with maleic anhydride was found to be a highly efficient, a versatile, and a facile chemical ligation reaction for the synthesis of macromolecules with quantitative yield under mild conditions. The main benefit is the incorporation of a wide range of functionality by easily changing the primary amine compound. For the amphiphilic graft copolymers based on poly(ethylene glycol), aggregation behavior in water was investigated. In a second part, azido&#8208;functionalized polystyrene copolymers were used to prepare a new protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugate by copper&#8208;free click chemistry reaction.

         <title>Supported Synthesis of Adenosine Nucleotides and Derivatives on a Benzene&#8208;Centered Tripodal Soluble Support</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy based on anchoring C(6) azidopurine nucleoside derivative to a tripodal soluble support allows to access the corresponding adenosine nucleotides. We extended the scope of the method to methylene bisphosphonate analogues and N6&#8208;benzylamine derivative.







Abstract
The first soluble&#8208;phase synthesis of adenosine nucleotides including &#945;,&#946; and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;methylene bisphosphonate analogues on a multi&#8208;pod support is reported. Anchoring of a 2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;protected purine nucleoside to the tripodal support via the nucleobase was successfully achieved using a microwave assisted Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition. Then, phosphorylation was performed, followed by cleavage with aqueous ammonia to provide adenine derivatives, and finally deprotection. When using benzylamine instead of ammonia, a derivative with N6&#8208;benzylamine adenine as nucleobase was obtained. This methodology allows to access adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;mono, di and triphosphates, as well as various analogues of pharmacological interest in modest to good yields.
