         <title>Construction of Difluoroalkylated Cyclopentenones through Photocatalytic Difluoroalkylative 5&#8208;endo Cyclization Cascades of Ynones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic difluoroalkylative 5&#8208;endo cyclization cascades of ynones is developed, providing facile access to synthetically important difluoroalkylated cyclopentenones in promising yields. It represents the first example of alkyldifluoroalkylation of alkynes.







Abstract
Difluoroalkyl groups and cyclopentenones are both important units in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. The difuoroalkylation coupled with a cyclopentenone formation still remains a challenge. Herein, we report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced cascade difluoroalkylative 5&#8208;endo cyclization of ynones with difluoroalkyl bromides to access difluoroalkylated cyclopentenones, which may find wide applications for the concise synthesis of fluorinated cyclic molecules.

         <title>Synthesis of Thiophene&#8208;fused Helicenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of three penta&#8208; and three hexahelicenes containing two terminal thiophene units is described. The syntheses of pentahelicenes consist of 1,4&#8208;bisalkynylation of a benzene precursor and double Suzuki coupling in 2,3&#8208;position to introduce thiophene units. The ortho,ortho&#8217; fusion yielding the final products was achieved with F&#252;rstner&#8217;s protocol using platinum(II) chloride or JohnPhos&#8208;complexed gold(I) as catalysts. A similar approach to hexahelicenes started with a naphthalene derivative, where 2,7&#8208;bisalkynylation and subsequent double Suzuki coupling with thiophene&#8208;2&#8208;boronic acid at 1,8&#8208;position furnished precursors, in which ortho,ortho&#8217; fusion to the respective hexahelicenes was achieved with platinum(II) chloride or, favourably, with indium(III) chloride. UV/Vis spectra and cyclic voltammograms were recorded for all helicenes and HOMO/LUMO gaps were calculated with DFT methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Reductive Amination in Organocatalysis and Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this review, the recent progress in the area of organocatalytic and biocatalytic asymmetric reductive amination (ARA) has been summarized, a challenging but important topic for drug discovery and the pharmaceutical industry. At present, ARA can be divided into three categories: metal catalysis, organic catalysis and biocatalysis. In the past decade, transition metal&#8208;catalysed ARA has been well established. Organocatalytic ARA has emerged as a powerful alternative to metal&#8208;catalysed ARA, the hydrogen sources used in organocatalytic ARA are usually hantzsch esters, benzothiazolines, boranes, and hydrosilanes, which require Lewis base or phosphoric acid catalysts to activate them to give secondary chiral amines. It is worth mentioning that biocatalytic ARA has made remarkable progress in the last decade, amino transferases, amino acid dehydrogenases, amine dehydrogenases, opine dehydrogenases and imine reductases have been successfully used in ARA.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Organocatalysts in Enantioselective CO2&#160;Utilization Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient CO2&#160;utilization reactions has gained a significant amount of attention in recent years. Although transformations of CO2&#160;to produce basic chemicals have been extensively investigated,&#160;the development of catalytic enantioselective CO2&#160;utilization reactions for the preparation of fine chemicals remains limited at this stage. Several excellent methods for catalytic enantioselective CO2&#160;utilization using chiral metal complex catalysts have been reported. Many researchers have also focused on developing organocatalyzed approaches to enantioselective CO2utilization, and several excellent examples have appeared in recent years. Herein, recent advances in catalytic enantioselective CO2&#160;utilization reactions using chiral organocatalysts are summarized to provide a forecast for organocatalyzed enantioselective CO2&#160;utilization research.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8208;H Functionalization of Aldehydes and Ketones with Transient Directing Groups: Recent Developments</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In order to directly functionalize C&#8722;H bonds of complex molecules and, in particular, to control the regioselectivity of the reaction, a wide range of directing groups has been used. However, these directing groups need to be installed and removed for further applications, which may limit the use of C&#8722;H activation in synthesis. Concerning aldehydes and ketones, a transient directing group strategy has recently emerged to overcome this drawback. The addition of an additive, in general an amine, allowed the in situ formation of the real directing group to achieve C&#8722;H activation. This review presents the latest developments in the field over the period 2020&#8208;2023.</dc:description>

         <title>Economical and Environmentally Friendly Organic Hydrazone Derivatives Characterized by a Heteroaromatic Core as Potential Hole Transporting Materials in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover represents the need for a sustainable and cheap material to provide energy in future cities. Perovskite solar cells are an innovative way to do so for both outdoor and indoor applications, but the organic materials used are usually sensitive and expensive. This work aims to find alternative organic hole transporting materials (HTMs) with reduced environmental impact to allow the diffusion of perovskite solar cells. More information can be found in the Research Article by N. Manfredi et&#8197;al.

         <title>Highly Chemoselective Reduction of Phosphine Oxides through Electrophilic Activation of the P=O Bond with Anhydride</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoselective reduction of phosphine oxides under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and alkaline conditions with the use of TFAA/NaH was developed. This reaction provides an efficient method for converting phosphine oxides into phosphines. It is deduced that P=O bond was firstly electrophilically activated by TFAA forming a phosphonium salt R3P(OOCCF3)2, and subsequently reduced by NaH, which was strengthened by 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5.







Abstract
A highly chemoselective reduction of phosphine oxides was demonstrated under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and alkaline reaction conditions. During the reaction, P=O bond was firstly electrophilically activated by an anhydride and subsequently reduced by the versatile and cheap NaH, which was strengthened by 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5. By this strategy, a variety of phosphine oxides including those bearing functional groups such as methyl, methoxyl, phenyl, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, trifluoromethyl, nitrile, ester, alkenyl, alkynyl and heterocycles were transformed readily into the corresponding phosphines in good to high yields. This work represents an efficient method for reducing phosphine oxides forming phosphines.

     alt="Highly Chemoselective Reduction of Phosphine Oxides through Electrophilic Activation of the P=O Bond with Anhydride"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chemoselective reduction of phosphine oxides under transition-metal-free and alkaline conditions with the use of TFAA/NaH was developed. This reaction provides an efficient method for converting phosphine oxides into phosphines. It is deduced that P=O bond was firstly electrophilically activated by TFAA forming a phosphonium salt R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P(OOCCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and subsequently reduced by NaH, which was strengthened by 15-crown-5.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

         <title>Asymmetric S&#8208;Michael Reaction: Synthesis of CF2H&#8722;Containing S&#8208;Ether Compounds through Isosteric Replacement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 25, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient synthesis of chiral CF2H&#8208; containing quaternary carbon compound was achieved in a mild condition.







Abstract
Optical pharmaceutical important compounds which bring CF2H to mimic the role of &#8211;SH were synthesized through the asymmetric S&#8208;Michael addition reaction in the presence of quinine&#8211;a derived squaramide catalyst. Various sulfhydryl compounds including Benzyl mercaptan, phenthiol, alkyl thiophenol, mercaptoacetate, methyl 3&#8208;mercaptoacrylate, and 1,4&#8208;dithiane&#8208;2,5&#8208;diol were tested. The broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and easy derivatization make this synthesis method very attractive.

         <title>Employing Click Chemistry to Expand the Scope of the Metal&#8208;Free Donor&#8208;Acceptor&#8208;Type Photocatalyst 4CzIPN</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 25, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy is reported to overcome the limited applicability of metal&#8208;free photocatalysts by implementing four exposed alkyne groups on the well&#8208;known structure motif of 4CzIPN. It is demonstrated that the modification enables the synthesis of new organic photocatalysts with unique redox features and paves the way for further targeted functionalisation.







Abstract
The design of a versatile alkyne&#8208;bearing derivative of the donor&#8208;acceptor fluorophore 2,4,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) isophthalonitrile (4CzIPN) suitable for further targeted modifications by copper&#8208;catalysed Azide Alkyne Cycloaddition (CuAAC) is reported. The newly synthesised photoredox catalyst notably exhibits analogously unique photoelectronic and steric features as the well&#8208;established carbazolyl dicyanobenzene motif and performs equally in a C&#8722;C&#8208;Coupling model reaction. Furthermore, the variability of this donor&#8208;acceptor system was demonstrated by the generation of a library of fourteen photoredox catalysts with electron&#8208;withdrawing and &#8208;donating groups as well as residues with high steric demands in one simple and selective CuAAC reaction. The modified catalysts feature a broad scope of reducing and oxidising powers in their excited states (span of reducing powers over more than 1&#8197;V) and were also successfully applied in the photoredox and nickel&#8208;catalysed decarboxylative cross coupling model reaction. This work represents a method to overcome the limitations in the flexibility of metal&#8208;free donor&#8208;acceptor fluorophores required for the targeted application in organic synthesis and paves the way for the design of customised catalysts with multiple functionalities.

The first synthesis of 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;sulfenyl&#8208;carbazoles and 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;selenyl&#8208;carbazoles was successfully achieved in a simple and efficient one&#8208;step reaction.







Abstract
The first direct and selective 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;thiolation and 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;selenylation of carbazoles using diaryl disulfides/diselenide as the sulfur/selenium source were demonstrated. This simple, general, and efficient method could deliver a wide range of 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;sulfenyl&#8208;carbazoles and 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;selenyl&#8208;carbazoles from readily available starting materials with high regioselectivity in an easily&#8208;operated one&#8208;step reaction via a Ag/K2S2O8&#8208;mediated protocol.

Using aryl bromides as aryl source in the presence of carbonate bases in 1,4&#8208;dioxane, the mono&#8208;C2&#8208;arylated benzo[1,2&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene&#8208;4,8&#8208;diones were regioselectively obtained. This procedure allowed to introduce both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor aryl substituents on the benzo[1,2&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene&#8208;4,8&#8208;dione unit. These conditions were also effective for the coupling with 1&#8208;bromonaphthalene, 9&#8208;bromophenanthrene as well as aryl bromides bearing synthetically useful nitrile, chloro and methoxy substituents. The photophysical properties of representative arylated compounds have been performed by joint experimental and theoretical studies.

         <title>Autocatalytic Green Synthesis of Imines in Traceless Medium</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 25, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green and convenient method of aldimines and ketoimines synthesis has been developed. The possibility of further one&#8208;pot modification of imines is shown. The reactions are catalyst free, and no additional purification is needed for the most products.







Abstract
For the first time, condensations of amines with carbonyl compounds have been performed in supercritical carbon dioxide (sc&#8208;CO2). The reactions with aldehydes or active ketones proceed at moderate temperatures (35&#8211;55&#8201;&#176;C) without use of external catalysts. The process is autocatalytic: it is accelerated by the carbonic acid generated in&#8197;situ by interaction between the released water and the CO2 medium. The imine products were obtained in high yields in a crystalline form and did not require further purification. The one&#8208;pot transfer hydrogenation and [4+2] cycloaddition reactions performed in the CO2 medium have uncovered attractive prospects for facile green synthesis of more complex and valuable compounds from the generated in&#8197;situ imine products.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 25, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light promoted radical reaction between &#945;&#8208;bromoacetophenone and thiosulfate has been reported. Two C&#8722;S bonds or one C&#8722;S and one C&#8722;Se bond can be stably constructed and the thiosulfonate is fully utilised with good atomic economy. The reaction uses ethanol as a green solvent, with mild reaction conditions and good substrate universality.

         <dc:description>
A straightforward access to novel families of enantioenriched cis&#8208;monofluorinated carbocyclic alcohols has been developed through ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation/dynamic kinetic resolution that proceeded in high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. Valuable enantioenriched vicinal difluorinated heterocycles and carbocycles, such as trans&#8208;difluorinated indans, tetrahydronaphthalenes, tetrahydroquinolines and chromans have been synthesized as well by deoxofluorination of the corresponding cis&#8208;fluoro alcohols.







Abstract
A straightforward method to access novel families of enantioenriched cis&#8208;monofluorinated carbocyclic alcohols has been developed through ATH/DKR in up to 97&#8201;% yield, up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and enantioinductions up to 97&#8201;% ee. Trans&#8208;difluorinated indans, tetrahydronaphthalenes, tetrahydroquinolines and chromans have been synthesized as well by deoxofluorination of the corresponding cis&#8208;fluoro alcohols. The reaction was performed on a series of variously substituted 3&#8208;fluorochromanols, 3&#8208;fluorotetrahydroquinolinols, 2&#8208;fluoro inden&#8208;1&#8208;ols and 2&#8208;fluoro 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydronaphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;ols in up to 86&#8201;% yields, with diastereoselectivities up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3 and enantioselectivities up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee.

Abstract
The novel synthetic approach was employed to synthesize a series of 1,8&#8208;dihydropyrazolo[3,4&#8208;b]azepine derivatives from 5&#8208;aminopyrazoles in three&#8208;step synthesis. The structures of the individual derivatives were unambiguously confirmed by spectral methods, including heteronuclear 1H&#8722;13C HMBC spectra and other necessary 2D NMR experiments. The obtained pyrazoloazepines and starting aminopyrazoles were subsequently investigated for their potential cytotoxic effect using mouse and human leukemia cell models. The original L1210 (mouse lymphoblastic), MOLM&#8208;13, and SKM&#8208;1 (both human myeloblastic) cell lines and their P&#8208;glycoprotein (P&#8208;gp) expressing cell variants were used. Aminopyrazole 8 was the most effective on murine leukemic lymphoblasts (L1210), while it had a greater effect on P&#8208;gp expressing cells. In contrast, on human leukemic myeloblasts (MOLM&#8208;13, SKM&#8208;1), Aminopyrazoles 10 showed the most pronounced effect, but this was independent of the presence of P&#8208;gp in the cells.

A methodology for the formal addition of &#946;&#8208;acylalkenyl anions was developed under Br&#248;nsted base catalysis. The two&#8208;step reaction, which involves the catalytic addition of &#945;&#8208;oxygenated propargyl anions generated via [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement to electron&#8208;deficient ketones and subsequent alcoholysis, afforded tertiary alcohols having an enone moiety.







Abstract
A methodology for the formal addition of &#946;&#8208;acylalkenyl anions was developed by utilizing the [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement under Br&#248;nsted base catalysis. The two&#8208;step reaction involves the catalytic addition of &#945;&#8208;oxygenated propargyl anions generated via [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement to electron&#8208;deficient ketones and subsequent alcoholysis to afford tertiary alcohols having an enone moiety. This is a rare example of a catalytic carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming reaction of &#946;&#8208;acylalkenyl anion equivalents, providing synthetic building blocks that are otherwise difficult to access.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 25, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover illustrates the simplicity and selectivity of the modification of organic donor&#8211;acceptor photocatalysts by click chemistry. The connection of an alkyne bearing 4CzIPN derivative with an azide forming a triazole&#8208;linker to tune the catalyst's photoelectronic properties is just as simple as putting together puzzle pieces. In the background a luminescent yellow solution of a new photoredox catalyst is irradiated with blue light enabling the decarboxylative cross coupling of amino acids with aryl halides.

         <dc:description>
Electrophilic sources of nitrogen&#8208;based groups have been known for many decades and are of great synthetic importance. Hypervalent iodine reagents bearing N&#8208;containing groups have emerged as an alternative to classical electrophilic amination reactions, and are capable of transferring a wide diversity of nitrogen&#8208;containing functional groups to organic molecules. The reactivity of these reagents as well as the mechanism and scope of the reactions are reviewed.







Abstract
Hypervalent iodine reagents have the ability of inverting the polarity of functional groups bound to iodine, a reactivity known as umpolung. This reactivity makes hypervalent iodine compounds highly attractive for the creation of electrophilic synthons of known nucleophiles, resulting in novel synthetic disconnections and the formation of new Nu(nucleophile)&#8722;N bond.
Electrophilic sources of nitrogen&#8208;based groups have been known for many decades and are of great synthetic importance. Traditionally, these reagents are limited to few examples. With the use of hypervalent iodine, the transfer of a wide diversity of nitrogen sources became a possibility. This review compiles the latest reported examples of hypervalent iodine reagents capable of electrophilic transfer of nitrogen&#8208;based groups. It showcases the preparation of such reagents, their synthetic utility, and reaction mechanisms involving these group transfer reagents.

         <title>Multicomponent Reactions Based on SO2 Surrogates: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 25, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicomponent reactions (MCRs) have become popular tools for the efficient generation of sulfonyl&#8208;containing molecules. Compared with gaseous SO2, the solid and stable sulfur dioxide surrogates are more convenient to handle. This significantly promotes the development of multi&#8208;component sulfonylation reactions, and some advances have been achieved in the asymmetric MCRs for the construction of high value&#8208;added chiral sulfones.







Abstract
Compounds containing sulfonyl&#8208;derived functional groups have received intensive attention owing to their widespread applications in life science, pharmaceuticals and materials science. To access this type of compounds, the multi&#8208;component sulfonylation reactions relying on sulfur dioxide (SO2) insertion strategy have emerged as novel and attractive approaches in the past decade. The utilization of SO2 surrogates for SO2 insertion in the multicomponent reactions (MCRs) have improved reaction flexibility and step economy. Moreover, some advances have been achieved in the challenging but practical asymmetric MCRs for the construction of high value&#8208;added chiral sulfones. This review aims to summarize the progress made in the MCRs involving SO2 surrogates from 2019 to 2022, and point out the potentials and challenges in this field.

         <title>Electrochemical Asymmetric Diacetoxylation of Styrenes Mediated by Chiral Iodoarene Catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organocatalysis with chiral iodoarenes has emerged as a powerful approach for performing enantioselective transformations, however, it suffers from the need to utilize stoichiometric amounts of peroxy acids or similar high energy oxidants. Electrosynthesis enables eliminating stoichiometric redox reagents by replacing them with electric stimuli. In this context, an electrochemically&#8208;promoted variant of the chiral iodoarene&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric diacetoxylation of styrenes was evaluated. The screening of reaction parameters established a set of conditions under which, for the first time, an enantioselective electrochemical oxidation mediated by a chiral iodoarene achieving a catalytic turnover has been accomplished. The reaction was applied for the synthesis of an array of products in 15&#8208;60% yields and 0&#8208;84% ee. The modest efficiency of the electrocatalysis was traced to a partial direct oxidation of styrene substrates leading to racemic products and undesired dimeric side&#8208;products. Cyclic voltammetry measurements demonstrated that such outcome originates from a somewhat difficult electrochemical oxidation of the applied iodoarene catalyst. Present work provides important insights and implications for the design of more efficient electrocatalytic systems employing chiral iodoarenes as mediators.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Bromination of 2,5&#8208;Dimethylbenzoic Acid as Key Step of an Improved Alkyne&#8208;Functionalized Blue Box Synthesis
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the synthesis of an alkyne&#8208;functionalized blue box has been revised. Overcoming the limits of the existing synthesis for every single step, the overall yield was increased five times. Importantly, photochemical bromination was adopted to obtain a key intermediate. The target compound was functionalized by using click&#8208;chemistry, and it was confirmed by electrochemical techniques that it retains the ability to engage in radical&#8208;radical interactions.







Abstract
Cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene), also known as &#8220;blue box&#8221;, is a highly electron&#8208;deficient macrocycle, widely used as a molecular receptor for small electron&#8208;rich molecules. Inserting a reactive functional group onto the molecular structure of this cyclophane is paramount for its inclusion into complex architectures. To this aim, including an alkyne moiety would be ideal, because it can participate in click reactions. However, the synthesis of such alkyne&#8208;functionalized cyclophane suffers from several drawbacks: the use of toxic and expensive CCl4, the need for high&#8208;pressure reactors, and overall low yield. We have revised the existing synthesis of this cyclophane derivative bearing an alkyne moiety, to overcome all these limitations. In particular, photochemical radical bromination is adopted to obtain a sensitive intermediate. We demonstrated that the synthesized host molecule can be functionalized via click reactions and take part in radical&#8208;radical interactions. Our work makes a key functionalized paraquat macrocycle more accessible, facilitating the development of novel redox&#8208;responsive systems.

         <title>Porous Organic Salts Composed of Terphenyl Sulfonic Acid and Their Bottleneck Designability</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organic salts (POSs) are constructed through a strong charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bond, and the molecular design of the sulfonic acid used enables access to various porous structures. The current work establishes a precise design methodology for POSs with high crystallinity and a one&#8208;dimensional pore in metal&#8208;free porous organic materials, which allows further functionalization of POSs.







Abstract
Porous organic salts (POSs) are constructed through a strong charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bond between sulfonic and amino groups. The molecular design of sulfonic acid, the linker part, enables various porous structures. In the current work, we synthesized p&#8208;terphenyl&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;disulfonic acid (TPDS), whose molecular structure can be easily modified by organic synthesis. Combining of TPDS and bulky tri&#8208;p&#8208;tolylmethanamine (TPMA&#8208;Me), which has three methyl groups at each para&#8208;position of the phenyl groups of triphenylmethylamine (TPMA), gave POS with one&#8208;dimensional pore channels having two different types of bottlenecks. The central benzene ring of TPDS is exposed on the surface of the pore. Therefore, we combined 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole&#8208;4,7&#8208;diyl)dibenzenesulfonic acid (BTDBS) containing 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (BT) with TPMA&#8208;Me, and successfully constructed a one&#8208;dimensional pore channel with a bottleneck of 3.5&#8197;&#197;, by exposing BT to the surface of the pore. BTDBS/TPMA&#8208;Me exhibited a large adsorption/desorption hysteresis of nitrogen because of the bottleneck, electronic state of BT, and larger oxygen adsorption than the isostructural TPDS/TPMA&#8208;Me. Systematic and intended modulation of the pore structure of POS based on the modification of sulfonic acid was demonstrated, and for the first time, we established a precise design methodology for a one&#8208;dimensional pore channel with a bottleneck and high crystallinity in metal&#8208;free porous organic materials.

A mechanochemical desymmetrization of symmetrical bis&#8208; and tris&#8208;alkynes via a controlled 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction with nitrile oxide dipoles has been developed. This convenient, efficient, and simple protocol allows access to a wide range of 3,5&#8208;isoxazole&#8208;alkyne adducts and unsymmetrical bis&#8208;3,5&#8208;isoxazoles from easily prepared or commercially available symmetrical bis&#8208; and tris&#8208;alkynes in moderate to excellent yield.







Abstract
A mechanochemical desymmetrization of symmetrical bis&#8208; and tris&#8208;alkynes by a controlled 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction using nitrile oxide dipoles (NOs). This operationally simple protocol allows access to 3,5&#8208;isoxazole&#8208;alkyne adducts from easily prepared or commercially available symmetrical bis&#8208; and tris&#8208;alkynes in moderate to excellent yields. In addition, we have highlighted the synthetic utility of 3,5&#8208;isoxazole&#8208;alkyne by developing a route to access, for the first time, &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;alkyne derivatives, and unsymmetrical bis&#8208;3,5&#8208;isoxazoles.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>De novo catalytic syntheses of diarylamines from a palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination of nitroarenes with aryl (pseudo)halides is described. The exquisite use of upstream nitroarenes as arylamine surrogates, the judicious selection of bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2) as a stoichiometric reducing agent, and wide substrate scope including (hetero)aryl halides (Cl, Br and I) and aryl triflates, constitute the striking features of the current protocol. Moreover, application of this technique to the syntheses of advanced intermediates and active pharmaceutical ingredients also proved successful, thus providing an alternative step&#8208;economical approach to the syntheses of diarylamine&#8208;incorporated molecules. Preliminary mechanistic investigation demonstrates that an amine and a nitrosoarene intermediates might be involved in this reductive event.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Aldol Reaction with Difluoroenoxysilanes Catalyzed by Cationic Palladium Aqua Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enantioselective addition of difluoroenoxysilanes to aromatic aldehydes, catalyzed by cationic palladium aqua complexes, has been described. The reaction is operationally simple, does not require anhydrous conditions and performs at room temperature. The palladium catalysts, previously discovered and reported by Sodeoka, are easily prepared in two steps from PdCl2(MeCN)2. The aldol compounds were obtained in good yields and with enantiomeric ratios up to 93:7, the reaction being more efficient using electron&#8208;rich aldehydes.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Al(III) Compounds as Catalysts for the Synthesis of Biodegradable Polyesters and Polycarbonates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proligands on reaction with trimethylaluminum (AlMe3) resulted in the formation of dinuclear aluminum compounds, where the ligand moieties resemble N&#8208;alkylated salan. The aluminum compounds were active towards the ROP of rac&#8208;LA and ROCOP of CHO and CO2 and ROCOP of epoxides (CHO, PO, tBuGE) with phthalic anhydride.







Abstract
Ethylenediamine bridged benzoxazine proligands were synthesized by a modified Mannich condensation reaction. The reaction of the proligands with two equivalents of AlMe3 resulted in the formation of dinuclear Al(III) compounds in high yield and purity. When the ligand binds to the Al(III) center, it forms two separate six&#8208;membered N,O&#8208;chelates with the two Al atoms that resembles the N&#8208;alkylated salan moiety. Each aluminum atom adopts a distorted tetrahedral geometry as revealed from the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of 1. The catalytic activity of these aluminum compounds was investigated towards the ROP of rac&#8208;LA and ROCOP of epoxides (PO, CHO, tBuGE) and phthalic anhydride and ROCOP of CHO with CO2. These aluminum compounds showed notable catalytic activity towards the ROP and ROCOP reactions in the absence of cocatalyst.

&lt;p&gt;The proligands on reaction with trimethylaluminum (AlMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) resulted in the formation of dinuclear aluminum compounds, where the ligand moieties resemble &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkylated salan. The aluminum compounds were active towards the ROP of &lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt;-LA and ROCOP of CHO and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ROCOP of epoxides (CHO, PO, &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuGE) with phthalic anhydride.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethylenediamine bridged benzoxazine proligands were synthesized by a modified Mannich condensation reaction. The reaction of the proligands with two equivalents of AlMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; resulted in the formation of dinuclear Al(III) compounds in high yield and purity. When the ligand binds to the Al(III) center, it forms two separate six-membered &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-chelates with the two Al atoms that resembles the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkylated salan moiety. Each aluminum atom adopts a distorted tetrahedral geometry as revealed from the single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. The catalytic activity of these aluminum compounds was investigated towards the ROP of &lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt;-LA and ROCOP of epoxides (PO, CHO, &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuGE) and phthalic anhydride and ROCOP of CHO with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

         <dc:description>
A diastereoselective and enantioselective formal [4+1] ylide annulation of chiral sulfonium salts with various substituted Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman adducts leading to optically active isoxazoline N&#8208;oxides. The enantioselective [4+1] annulations give a variety of multifunctional isoxazoline N&#8208;oxides with three chiral carbon centers under mild conditions.







Abstract
A diastereoselective and enantioselective formal [4+1] ylide annulation of chiral sulfonium salts with various substituted Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) adducts leading to optically active isoxazoline N&#8208;oxides with three chiral carbon centers has been explored. The salient features of this methodology include a high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective transformation, easily accessible starting materials, and mild reaction conditions. In addition, the isoxazoline N&#8208;oxides products can be conveniently transformed into functionalized compounds.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mannich&#8208;type reactions involving alkylzinc reagents have been developed using different strategies. We show that the addition of these organometallic species to sulfonyl imines occurs upon simple heating and affords Mannich products in moderate to excellent yields (14 examples, 30&#8208;99%). Interestingly, N&#8208;alkyl imines were also found to be suitable partners after activation as an acyliminium by acetyl chloride (12 examples, 49&#8208;86%) or, more originally, by TMSCl (14 examples, 26&#8208;87%). These methods proved complementary, leading to the preparation of both N&#8208;protected secondary or tertiary amines and N&#8208;unprotected secondary amines in good yields, with an increased eco&#8208;compatibility, and under simple conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Forging C&#8722;S Bonds on the Azetidine Ring by Continuous Flow Photochemical Addition of Thiols and Disulfides to Azetines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward method to forge C&#8722;S bonds on the azetidine ring under continuous flow conditions has been disclosed accessing unexplored chemical space. The strategy relies on the light&#8208;promoted radical addition of thiyl radicals to 2&#8208;azetines. Green metrics were calculated to demonstrate the greenness of the flow process compared to batch.







Abstract
A strategy for anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroalkyl/aryl thiolation and disulfidation of 2&#8208;azetines under continuous flow conditions has been developed. Thiyl radicals are generated from thiols or disulfides and subsequently propagate into the azetine unsaturation to forge the C&#8722;S bond and shape a secondary radical intermediate. This carbon&#8208;centered radical chain transfers to another thiol via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) or another disulfide to regenerate the key thiyl radical intermediates. The use of flow technology ensures efficient irradiation of the reaction mixture leading to extremely fast, robust, and scalable protocols. Furthermore, ethyl acetate was adopted as an environmentally responsible solvent.

Abstract
The Cu(OTf)2&#8208;catalyzed alkyl&#8211;alkyl coupling reaction of a secondary substrate MeCH(OSO2Py)CH2CH2C6H4(4&#8208;OMe) with a nBuLi&#8208;based reagent prepared by transmetalation with MgBr2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF3 in THF produced a coupling product in 74&#8201;% yield. The use of soluble MgBr2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF3 in THF was required for this reaction. This method was applied to sBuLi and Ph(CH2)4Li. In contrast, transmetalation of MeLi with soluble MgCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF2 in THF produced the Me reagent, which was reactive for the coupling reaction. The reaction proceeded with inversion of the stereogenic carbon. Furthermore, (S)&#8208;14&#8208;methyloctadecan&#8208;2&#8208;one, a sex pheromone produced by lichen moths, was synthesized.

         <title>Synthesis of [1,2,3]Triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]quinoline&#8208;3&#8208;carboxamides Promoted by Organocatalyst and Base</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We described here a simple and metal&#8208;free protocol to synthesize [1,2,3]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]quinoline 3&#8208;carboxamides through a two&#8208;step synthetic strategy, in which the first step uses organocatalysis (10 mol% of diethylamine or 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene, while the second step involves the use of inorganic base (1.2 or 0.1 equiv of potassium hydroxide). These reactions were performed between &#946;&#8208;keto amides and o&#8208;carbonyl phenylazides in dimethylsulfoxide as solvent at 70 &#176;C for 2 h. The synthetic protocol is ample, which thirteen examples of secondary [1,2,3]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]quinoline 3&#8208;carboxamides were synthesized ranging from good to excellent yields (63&#8208;96%), and six different tertiary [1,2,3]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines 3&#8208;carboxamides were obtained ranging from moderate to good yields (48&#8208;76%).</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Soluble Quinacridone Photocatalysts for the Homogeneous Oxidation of Thioethers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Evaluation of quinacridone (QA) derivatives as homogeneous metal&#8208;free photocatalysts is here presented. QA derivatives were synthetized and systematically characterized, measuring their ground state and excited state redox potentials in dichloromethane (DCM) and 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP), in order to understand how structural modifications influenced their photocatalytic properties. In particular, the effect of dicyanomethylene and nitro EWG groups was investigated, in order to develop a photocatalyst capable of promoting oxidative processes in the presence of molecular oxygen. Among the analyzed derivatives, 2,9&#8208;dinitro&#8208;N,N'&#8208;dibutylquinacridone (DNDBQA) was the one with the highest excited state reduction potential (Ered*= 1.60 V in HFIP vs SCE), while N,N&#8217;&#8208;dibutylquinacridone (DBQA) showed valuable excited state redox potentials (Ered*= 1.29 V; Eox*= &#8208;1.28 V in HFIP vs SCE), making it suitable for bimodal applications in oxidative and reductive photocatalytic processes. Afterwards, the synthetized QA derivatives were examined as photocatalysts to promote the selective aerobic oxidation of thioether to sulfoxide. Promising results in thioanisole oxidation were achieved with all the QA derivatives tested as photocatalysts, in terms of yield and selectivity. Remarkably, DBQA showed the best performances, catalyzing the reaction in only 20 minutes, using 0.5% of the photocatalyst, and showing excellent performances in the oxidation of several thioether derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>An Improved Procedure for Aryne Generation from o&#8208;Triazenylarylboronic Acids through One&#8208;Pot Boronate Formation/Silica Gel Treatment</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed an improved method for generating aryne from o&#8208;triazenylarylboronic acids. Unlike the previous method that required excess o&#8208;triazenylarylboronic acids as aryne precursors, we used corresponding boronates as limiting reagents, which resulted in high yields. By combining the formation of boronates and aryne generation through silica gel treatment in one&#8208;pot, we were able to effectively use a wide range of o&#8208;triazenylarylboronic acids in reactions with various arynophiles. This one&#8208;pot method was particularly suitable for transforming complex aryne precursors with different functional groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrazine Derivative as Supramolecular Host for Immobilization of Palladium&#160;Nanoparticles for Efficient Suzuki Coupling</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium nanoparticles (NPs) have been extensively explored as unique catalyst for carbon&#8208;carbon coupling reactions. Nonetheless, because of extreme tendency of nanoparticles to undergo agglomeration, the immobilization of these metal NPs on organic frameworks is an important area of research. The present investigation demonstrates the synthesis of pyrazine derivative PYZ&#8208;TA as a supramolecular host for holding co&#8208;released Pd NPs derived from the original catalyst (Pd(II)) under standard Suzuki coupling. Unprecedent, physical bars are not required to capture Pd NPs within the pores of supramolecular host. The as obtained catalyst PYZ&#8208;TA@Pd exhibits high potential to undergo self&#8208;assembly in solid as well as in liquid state. ThePYZ&#8208;TA@Pd ensemble shows high catalytic activity and recyclability (up to seven cycles) in Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reactions using low palladium loading and provides the corresponding products in excellent yields (up to 98%). Therefore, this study provides an efficient strategy to develop an easy to synthesize palladium centered solid catalyst through coordination between organic host and Pd NPs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Pd&#8208;catalyzed Domino C&#8208;C bond forming reaction was developed for the synthesis of polyheterocyclic benzimidazo&#8208;indolo&#8208;isoquinolines. Regioselectively cyclised products were obtained in good yields, and these hybrid molecules exhibited strong solid/solution state fluorescence.







Abstract
Regioselective synthesis of N&#8208;fused benzimidazo&#8208;indolo&#8208;isoquinoline heterocycles via Pd&#8208;catalyzed domino coupling reaction of 1&#8208;(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;indol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazoles and aryl halides was developed. This one pot methodology proceeded via a five&#8208;member carbopalladacycle intermediate and provided direct and facile route to access structurally complex polyheterocycles in moderate to good yields. These unique hybrid molecules resembled structural similarity with naturally isolated alkaloids. Notably, the present domino process occurred through activation of three C&#8208;H bonds and the simultaneous formation of two new C&#8208;C bonds in one&#8208;shot. These molecules exhibited strong solid and solution phase fluorescence and their emission spectra in both the medium are reported here.

         <title>Preparation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethyl&#8208;pyrimidine Based Nucleosides: A Reinvestigation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different approaches currently used to introduce the 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl moiety onto pyrimidine&#8208;based deoxynucleosides were reinvestigated. The oxidation of the methyl of thymidine followed by the reduction of the resulting formyl group allowed access to protected 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridine in a simple way and in good yields. Examples of application to the synthesis of relevant building blocks are presented.







Abstract
5&#8208;Hydroxymethyl&#8208;pyrimidine&#8208;based nucleobases have attracted attention in the last years due to their important role in gene regulation. It prompted the development of efficient routes to the corresponding nucleoside building blocks for further incorporation into oligonucleotides. Several pathways have been employed in recent years to access properly protected 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;pyrimidine based nucleosides, including hydroxymethylation of 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridine, radical bromination of thymidine followed by bromine substitution, or carbonylative coupling through Stille conditions starting from 5&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridine. In this study, we review the different approaches currently used to introduce the 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl moiety, we reinvestigate some of them, and finally, we propose an alternative route based on the oxidation of the methyl of thymidine followed by its reduction that allows access to protected 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridine in a simple way with good yields. Finally, we present some examples of application including the synthesis of base J and 5&#8208;azidomethyl&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridine.

Finally, we present some examples of application including the synthesis of base J and 5-azidomethyl-2&#8217;-deoxyuridine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of an Octacyclic C60 Fragment</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of an unexplored C60&#8208;fragmentary octacycle (C28H16; 4,11&#8208;dihydrodiindeno[7,1,2&#8208;ghi:7&#8242;,1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;pqr]chrysene), which we named Metelykene (derived from &#8220;metelyk&#8221; that means butterfly in Ukrainian) is described. The key precursor is a solution&#8208;processable hexacycle having fourfold tert&#8208;butyls and twofold bromines. The bromines were substituted with carbonyls, and the following cyclization yielded the C60&#8208;fragment core, unattainable so far.







Abstract
Fragments of buckminsterfullerene (C60) include the monumental three compounds corannulene, sumanene, and truxene. These three have served as leading molecules in ongoing research for curved, fused, and &#960;&#8208;extended polyaromatic materials. Achieving more structural variations that join the ranks of these three archetypes remains challenging. Herein we report synthesis of an octacyclic hydrocarbon that is an unexplored C60&#8208;fragment, namely, a 4,11&#8208;dihydrodiindeno[7,1,2&#8208;ghi:7&#8242;,1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;pqr]chrysene (C28H16, which we named Metelykene). The key to success was solution&#8208;compatible synthesis in which double pentagonal rings flank hexagonal ones. This solution&#8208;phase approach, coupled with the resulting non&#8208;planar &#960;&#8208;conjugation, is so straightforward that it offers an entry to a derivative such as a cardo aromatic monomer.

         <title>Influence of Substitution on the Supramolecular Chemistry of Cycloparaphenylene&#8208;Fullerene Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a comprehensive host&#8208;guest study of four substituted and unsubstituted [10]cycloparaphenylenes with the fullerenes C60 and C70. Within this study, the influence on the complexation behavior was investigated experimentally and computationally. Due to the increased steric demand the substitution on the nanohoop results in an energetic penalty, which could be partially compensated by additional substituent&#8208;fullerene interactions. These attractive interactions are intensified in the C70 complexes and with an increased degree of substitution. For the computational investigation conformer ensembles were taken into account, providing reliable structures with Boltzmann weighted energies. An analysis of the noncovalent interactions elucidates the origin of the enhanced substituent&#8208;C70 interaction. The ellipsoid fullerene C70 can be considered as a &#960;&#8208;extended version of C60, which is able to increase the attractive van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals interactions within these supramolecular complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic and Product Study of the S&#8208;oxidation vs HAT Chemoselectivity in Reactions Promoted by Nonheme Iron(IV)&#8208;oxo Complex/NHPI Mediator System</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemoselectivity between S&#8208;oxidation and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from C&#8208;H bonds has been investigated in the oxidations of a series of aryl sulfides, alkylaromatic compounds and benzylic alcohols promoted by the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex [(N4Py)FeIV(O)]2+ (N4Py: N,N&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)&#8208;N&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;methylamine) either alone or in the presence of the N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) mediator via kinetic and product studies. Kinetic analyses indicate a generally higher reactivity of [(N4Py)FeIV(O)]2+ for S&#8208;oxidation process while HAT is favored in the reactions promoted by phthalimide&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl radical (PINO) deriving from NHPI oxidation. Product analysis in intermolecular competitive oxidations confirms the kinetic results with sulfoxides obtained as major products in the oxidation promoted by [(N4Py)FeIV(O)]2+. Conversely, when NHPI is employed as a mediator, significant differences in terms of chemoselectivity are observed, and HAT&#8208;derived products are obtained in higher yields which translate into an inversion of selectivity in the case of the substrates containing activated C&#8208;H bonds like diphenylmethane, triphenylmethane and benzylic alcohols. A similar change of chemoselectivity is also observed in the oxidation of aromatic substrates containing both a sulfur atom and a to OH benzylic C&#8208;H bonds, with the sulfoxide product more abundant in the absence of NHPI and carbonyl products prevailing with the [(N4Py)FeIV(O)]/NHPI system.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Arylation and Benzylation of Tyrosine at the &#948;&#8208;C(sp2)&#8208;H and C(2) Positions: Expanding the Library of Unnatural Tyrosines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper describes Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed picolinamide&#8208;directed intermolecular arylation and benzylation of remote &#948;&#8208;C(sp2)&#8208;H bond (C(2) position) of the aryl ring in tyrosine derivatives and expansion of the library of unnatural tyrosine. Various racemic and enantiopure bis C(2) (ortho C&#8208;H) arylated and benzylated tyrosine derivatives were assembled in good yields. Removal of the picolinoyl moiety after the C(2)&#8208;H arylation and assembling of tyrosine&#8208;based peptides using C(2)&#8208;H arylated tyrosines were shown. Tyrosine derivatives and biaryl amino acids are vital scaffolds in medicinal chemistry. Correspondingly, this work is a contribution towards the expansion of the unnatural tyrosine library with biaryl&#8208; or terphenyl and diarylmethane&#8208;based tyrosine scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Heterocycles from 2&#8208;Acylbenzoic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here summarized the recent progress in the application of 2&#8208;acylbenzoic acids for the synthesis of heterocycles including phthalides, isochromanones, isoindolines, phthalazinones, quinolones and their derivatives.







Abstract
Heterocyclics are the crucial scaffolds present in pharmaceuticals, natural products, biologically active compounds and agrochemicals. Consequently, the development of simple and practical methods for constructing heterocyclics has always been a fascinating field in organic synthesis. Recently, 2&#8208;acylbenzoic acids, highly reactive and versatile synthons, have been broadly applied in the construction of heterocycles due to their multiple reaction sites. In this review, we summarized recent progress in the application of 2&#8208;acylbenzoic acids for the synthesis of heterocycles including phthalides, isochromanones, isoindolines, phthalazinones, and quinolones. The substrate scopes, proposed mechanisms, and product application of different types of reactions are discussed.

         <title>CO2 Hydroboration: Impact of the Boryl Moieties on the Reactivity of Four Bis(boryl)acetal Compounds toward 2,6&#8208;Diisopropylaniline</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydroboration of CO2 into bis(boryl)acetal (BBA) compounds is an important transformation, since it enabled to selectively reduce CO2 by 4e&#8208; and to subsequently use the BBA compounds as C1 and Cn sources. However, the influence of the nature of the boryl moieties on the reactivity of BBA compounds has not been evaluated so far. In the present study, four BBA compounds &#8211; including two new ones &#8211; were reacted with 2,6&#8208;diisopropylaniline to afford the expected imine. Significant differences in the rate of the reaction from minutes to weeks have been observed depending on the BBA used, showing the importance of the nature of the boryl moieties. Theoretical investigations enabled to propose a mechanism involving the addition of the aniline to the BBA as the rate&#8208;determining step and to determine that the steric hindrance of the BBA compounds is the main factor driving the rate of this condensation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Tris(benzophenoneimino)phosphane and Related Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different hats of an old phosphane: P(bpi)3, a bulky phosphane, has been prepared using a Grignard reagent in diglyme. The phosphane has been further used to prepare phosphazenes and phosphonium cations. Protonation of P(bpi)3 and deprotonation of some phosphonium cations led to P&#8722;N heterocycles via an H&#8208;atom transfer. pKaH values in MeCN and THF were measured or predicted.







Abstract
A new group of bases with benzophenoneiminyl (bpi) moiety has been synthesized and characterized in this work. The title compound tris(benzophenoneimino)phosphane (P(bpi)3) 1 was prepared with a convenient one&#8208;pot approach: benzophenone imine was deprotonated using MeMgCl and reacted with PBr3 in diglyme. The method could be considered as a method of choice for preparing other (amino)phosphanes in case lithio&#8208;intermediates and/or protonated phosphane is out of consideration. Phosphane 1 is further used to prepare a range of related phosphonium cations and phosphazenes. Phosphonium cations were deprotonated to assess the stability of the resulting phosphonium ylides. In some cases, the bulky substances were capable of forming P&#8722;N heterocycles. Experimental (MeCN) and computational (MeCN, THF, gas&#8208;phase) basicities of benzophenone imine, phosphane 1, phosphonium ylides, and phosphazenes, as well as some representative XRD structures, are presented and discussed.

         <dc:description>N&#8211;O &#963; bonds containing compounds are versatile substrates for organic synthesis under transition metal catalysis. Their ability to react through both polar (oxidative addition, formation of metallanitrene, nucleophilic substitution) and radical pathways (single electron transfer, homolytic bond scission) have triggered the development of various synthetic methodologies, particularly toward synthesizing nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds. In this review, we discuss the different modes of activation of N&#8211;O bonds in the presence of transition metal catalysts, emphasizing the experimental and computational mechanistic proofs in the literature to help to design new synthetic pathways toward the synthesis of C&#8211;N bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Phosphite and Phosphoramidite Ligands for Rh&#8208;catalyzed Hydroformylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation of olefins is an important method for synthesizing aldehydes, and it is worth noting that regioselectivity and enantioselectivity of the product controlled by ligand are the most commonly used strategies. The modular synthesis of phosphite and phosphoramidite ligands have the significant advantages of simple synthesis and high catalytic activity, which was why these ligands have been widely used in hydroformylation reactions. Herein, we focus on the synthesis methods and design ideas of such ligands, as well as their application effects in hydroformylation reactions. This review aims to provide a reference for the design and synthesis of ligands in hydroformylation subsequently.</dc:description>

The modular synthesis of phosphite and phosphoramidite ligands have the significant advantages of simple synthesis and high catalytic activity, which was why these ligands have been widely used in hydroformylation reactions. Herein, we focus on the synthesis methods and design ideas of such ligands, as well as their application effects in hydroformylation reactions. This review aims to provide a reference for the design and synthesis of ligands in hydroformylation subsequently.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we reported an efficient photoredox&#8208;catalyzed reaction for site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization of carboxamides with silyl enol ethers as radical acceptors. The reaction proceeded through amidyl radical&#8208;directed 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (1,5&#8208;HAT) and C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) bond formation via radical addition of silyl enol ethers. The process features mild conditions and high functional&#8208;group tolerance, allowing the preparation of a series of carboxamides with pendant carbonyl moieties.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Arylquinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones under Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation with Oxygen&#8208;Doped Carbon Nitride as Heterogenous Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nitride material was reported as an efficient solid photocatalyst for the synthesis of 3&#8208;arylquinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones via the reaction of quinoxaline&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones &amp; aryl diazonium tetrafluoroborates under blue light irradiation in the absence of any metal, oxidant, or additives. This protocol features a wide substrate scope, good yields, and moderate reaction conditions.







Abstract
A novel oxygen&#8208;doped graphitic carbon nitride (OCN) material was designed and synthesized via the hydrothermal&#8208;calcination method with melamine and hydroperoxide as starting materials. The OCN material was utilized as a highly efficient solid metal&#8208;free photocatalyst for the synthesis of 3&#8208;arylquinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones via the catalytic decomposition of aryl diazonium salts under blue light irradiation. Following this approach, various 3&#8208;arylquinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives could be obtained in moderate to excellent yields with broad substrate scope under mild conditions. Also, the OCN solid photocatalyst shows good recyclability in the reaction, there was no appreciable loss in yields observed even after 5 cycles. This methodology offers a practical, mild, and metal&#8208;free alternative to the preparation of 3&#8208;arylquinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Photocatalytic Fluoroalkylation of Aromatic Crown Ethers in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A late stage photocatalytic highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective fluoroalkylation protocol for aromatic crown ethers is reported. High yields, mild conditions, aqueous solvent, easy scalability, as well as inexpensive reagents and catalyst make this one of the few practical direct functionalization methods for this important family of macrocycles. Its wide scope is further highlighted by the post synthetic modification of mechanically interlocked molecules.







Abstract
Modified crown ethers are fundamental building blocks in supramolecular chemistry, with applications in phase transfer catalysis, metal extraction, smart materials, and molecular machines. Here we report on a one&#8208;pot highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective photocatalytic fluoroalkylation protocol for the mono&#8208;functionalization of benzo substituted crown ethers. For this important class of macrocycles, the method described here represents one of the few late&#8208;stage functionalization procedures that is both high yielding and scalable. Because of its breadth of scope and substrate tolerance, the devised approach can be applied to a wide range of aromatic crown ethers (18&#8197;examples, up to 99&#8201;% yield), including those engaged in mechanically interlocked molecules.

         <title>Stereocomplementary Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Aryl Propanamines by Enzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution&#8208;Reductive Amination</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imine reductase (IRED)&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution&#8208;reductive amination of 2&#8208;phenylpropanal derivatives was developed to access a range of (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aryl propanamines with excellent conversion and enantioselectivity (90&#8201;% to 99&#8201;% ee). Two 3&#8208;methylindolines were obtained through a Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination and deallylation, providing an effective method to construct this class of pharmaceutically important compounds.







Abstract
Chiral &#946;&#8208;aryl propanamine is an important structure unit of bioactive molecules or drugs. But its efficient synthesis remains a challenging task. In this study, several enantiocomplementary imine reductases capable of dynamic kinetic resolution&#8208;reductive amination of sixteen 2&#8208;phenylpropanal derivatives of diverse structural characteristics with four different amines were identified through screening 196 imine reductases. Furthermore, (S)&#8208;IR60, (R)&#8208;IR74 and (R)&#8208;IR207 were applied to access a series of different &#946;&#8208;aryl propanamines with excellent ee values (90 to 99&#8201;%) and high isolated yields (36 to 79&#8201;%), and two of them were further transformed into 3&#8208;methylindolines through intramolecular Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig cross&#8208;coupling and deallylation, providing an effective method to construct this class of pharmaceutically important compounds.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Mediated One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of 1,4,5&#8208;Substituted Pyrazoles from MBH Acetates via Allyl Hydrazone Intermediate</title>

         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot regioselective synthesis of 1,4,5&#8208;pyrazoles through a iodine&#8208;mediated reaction between Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman acetates and hydrazines via intermediacy of allyl hydrazone is described.







Abstract
Herein, we report the regioselective one&#8208;pot synthesis of 1,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted pyrazoles by reacting Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) acetates derived from aryl aldehydes with alkyl or aryl hydrazines in the presence of iodine under aerobic conditions. The reaction proceeds through sequential SN2&#8242; nucleophilic substitution of substituted hydrazine onto the MBH acetate, I2&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of the allylic hydrazine to allylic hydrazone, heating&#8208;induced intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael reaction and cyclization, and oxidative aromatization. The key intermediate, the s&#8208;trans allyl hydrazones were isolated in good yields by performing the reactions at room temperature. However, the allyl hydrazones prepared from the MBH acetates of aliphatic aldehydes did not furnish the pyrazole owing to the absence of an activated methylene group in the substrate. The synthetic applications of the pyrazoles in Ugi reactions, decarboxylative halogenation, Pd&#8208;catalyzed benzoylation of the N&#8208;aryl ring, and metal&#8208;free tetrazole synthesis has been demonstrated.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalysed Hydroaminocarbonylation of Olefins with Aliphatic Amines without Additives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalysed hydroaminocarbonylation reactions of olefins using aliphatic amines were performed under carbon monoxide atmosphere. Despite the strong basicity of the applied nucleophiles, the targeted amides were successfully synthesised in the absence of acidic additives. Styrene, oct&#8208;1&#8208;ene and isoprene were transformed to the corresponding amide isomers in moderate to good isolated yields under optimized reaction conditions. Various aliphatic amines were used as N&#8208;nucleophiles. The effect of chiral diphosphines on product distribution, that is, on chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities was also studied. Plausible explanation was given for the additive&#8208;free hydroaminocarbonylation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Collective Total Synthesis of 4&#8208;Azafluorenone Alkaloids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Previous approaches to 4&#8208;azafluorenone alkaloid syntheses featuring 2&#8208;arylnicotinates are supplemented with tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide&#8208;mediated radical cyclization and/or bromine substituents as latent hydroxy groups which allows for flexible synthesis of highly oxygenated 4&#8208;azafluorenone alkaloids, including 5&#8208;oxygenated derivatives inaccessible via conventional Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization of 2&#8208;arylnicotinates. Eleven examples are presented including 5 first total synthesis.







Abstract
4&#8208;Azafluorenones are typically obtained by acid&#8208;mediated cyclization of 2&#8208;arylnicotinates. However, this approach fails to give 5&#8208;oxygenated 4&#8208;azafluorenones due to lactonization of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;alkoxy)phenylnicotinate intermediates. Herein, we report two modifications of established approaches to 4&#8208;azafluorenone synthesis that, either in combination or by themselves, enable the flexible preparation of 4&#8208;azafluorenones with diverse oxygenation patterns in the benzenoid ring. Undesired lactonization was circumvented via tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP)&#8208;mediated radical cyclization of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)pyridines. In the absence of suitable protecting groups for phenolic intermediates, bromide substituents were regioselectively introduced as latent hydroxy groups and later converted under palladium catalysis. We present the first total syntheses of five 4&#8208;azafluorenone alkaloids muniranine, darienine, 5,8&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;7&#8208;hydroxyonychine, 5,6,7,8&#8208;tetramethoxyonychine, and 6,8&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;7&#8208;methoxyonychine in addition to new total syntheses of six 4&#8208;azafluorenone alkaloids and one related pyridocoumarin alkaloid.

         <title>The meta and para OH Substitution Effect on C&#8208;Phenyl&#8208;Nitrilimine Bond&#8208;Shift Isomers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The meta and para OH substituted C&#8208;phenyl&#8208;nitrilimines were generated in argon matrices and characterized by IR spectroscopy and quantum mechanical calculations. Whereas the first exists as two bond&#8208;shift isomers of allenic and propargylic type, the second exists as single structure of significant allenic type. Results provided fundamental knowledge to understand the substitution effects on the structural nature of this important class of reactive compounds.







Abstract
The geometric and electronic structure of 1,3&#8208;dipolar species, in particular of nitrile imines, can be surprisingly intricate. A particular example is the C&#8208;phenyl&#8208;nitrilimine, which exists as two energy minima that constitute bond&#8208;shift isomers. To examine the effect of substituents in the phenyl ring, here we investigate the meta and para OH substituted derivatives. These two nitrile imines were generated in an argon matrix by UV&#8208;irradiation of 2H&#8208;tetrazole precursors and found to photoisomerize to carbodiimides via 1H&#8208;diazirines. The different effects of the OH substitution in meta and para positions on the bond&#8208;shift isomerism are rationalized with the support of Natural Resonance Theory and Hirshfeld atomic charges. The understanding of how substitution affects the structural characteristics of C&#8208;phenyl&#8208;nitrilimines, opens a door to modulate the chemistry of those compounds (e.&#8201;g. in cycloaddition reactions) by appropriate tuning of their substitution (substituent type and position).

         <title>Aryl Crown Ethers Based on d&#8208;Glucose Scaffold &#8211; Highly Selective Receptors of Amino Acid Ester Hydrochlorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two aryl crown ethers based on a glucose scaffold were developed for the purpose of selective binding of amino acid ester hydrochlorides in water. Whereas the receptor containing a phenyl ring binds guests with aromatic and hydrophobic sidechains with high enantioselectivity, the receptor with a naphthyl functionality allows for chemoselective binding of aromatic amino acid esters.







Abstract
Amino acids are important biomolecules with a broad scope of applications in chemical and biological sciences. Their functions and properties depend on their absolute configuration. Therefore, methods for chiral recognition and separation of amino acids are highly sought after. For the purposes of diagnostic and medicinal applications chiral recognition of amino acids in water is particularly relevant. However synthetic receptors for enantioselective binding of amino acids in aqueous media are rare. Recently we reported a d&#8208;glucose&#8208;based crown ether for chiral recognition of amino acid esters in water. We achieved enantioselectivities towards amino acids with hydrophobic sidechains which were among the highest ever reported for a small molecule receptor. The binding affinities were however moderate. Herein we disclose analogs of that receptor, containing aryl functionalities in the crown ether fragment. The new receptors show considerably improved binding affinities for amino acid ester hydrochlorides in water, while retaining high enantio&#8208; or chemoselectivities.

         <dc:description>A systematic study on the SNAr reaction of halogenated fluoropyridines and (hetero)aliphatic nitrile anions as an approach to the synthesis of functionalized pyridines bearing a (cyclo)alkyl or saturated heterocyclic substituent by is described. The scope of the method was demonstrated on a wide range of (hetero)aliphatic nitriles (including three&#8208; to six&#8208;membered cycloalkane derivatives and N&#8208;, O&#8208;, S&#8208;containing saturated heterocycles) and all isomeric halogenated 2&#8208;and 4&#8208;fluoropyridines. High chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity (i.e., exclu&#173;sive substitution of the fluorine atom), as well as excellent scalability of the proposed reaction sequence were demonstrated (up to 450 g for the arylation step or up to 77 g of cycloalkylpyridine over two steps in a single run).

         <title>Selenium Analogue of LSZ102 as a Highly Potent ER&#8208;&#945; Binder</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 10&#8208;step synthetic procedure has been developed for the preparation of selenium analogue of SERD agent LSZ102. The obtained selenium analogue is a highly potent ER&#8208;&#945; binder, and the exhibited biologic activity pattern is closely related to LSZ102 itself.







Abstract
Nowadays, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and downregulators (SERDs) are used as the first&#8208;line medical treatment for estrogen receptor positive (ER+) tumors. Herein we report synthesis, ER&#8208;&#945; binding activity, and cytotoxicity of LSZ102 selenium analogues 11 and 28. TR&#8208;FRET competitive ER&#8208;&#945; binding experiments and cytotoxicity assays have shown that the selenium analogues exhibit closely related activity to LSZ102. Furthermore, the prepared selenium analogues are not toxic in rat cardiomyoblasts (H9C2), indicating that substituted benzo[b]selenophene is a prospective scaffold for the development of ER&#8208;&#945; modulators and downregulators for the treatment of ER+ cancers.

A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed dearomative 1,4&#8208;acyl migratory rearrangement reaction of 2&#8208;oxypyridines has been developed for the direct synthesis of N&#8208;alkylated 2&#8208;pyridones under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed dearomative 1,4&#8208;acyl migratory rearrangement reaction of 2&#8208;oxypyridines has been developed for the direct synthesis of 2&#8208;alkylated pyridones under mild reaction conditions. Different with the former reports, in this protocol, readily accessible and bench stable vinyl N&#8208;nosylhydrazones instead of diazoacetates have been used as carbene precursors. As a result, a range of N&#8208;alkylated pyridones have been prepared in acceptable yields with good functional group tolerance.

         <title>Aza&#8208;Michael Reaction: A Decade Later &#8211; Is the Research Over?</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Since its discovery, the aza&#8208;Michael reaction has been the subject of intense research. This Review summarizes the strategies for conjugate nucleophilic addition of aliphatic and aromatic amines to electron&#8208;deficient alkenes that have been developed in the last decade.







Abstract
The 1,4&#8208;conjugated addition of nitrogen centered nucleophiles to electron&#8208;deficient alkenes, historically called the aza&#8208;Michael addition, is one of the most significant and widely used reactions in modern synthetic organic chemistry. In the last decade, great progress has been made in this field namely in the development of various catalytic systems. Fundamental advances involve the use of transition metal catalysts, organocatalysts, enzymes, ionic liquids, Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acids and bases. This Review aims to critically analyze the results of research into the reactions of aliphatic and aromatic amines with Michael acceptors.

         <dc:description>The direct use of alcohols as the much greener and more sustainable alkylated reagents in substitution reactions is one of the emerging areas in green chemisty. However, owing to the poor leaving character of OH group, the direct substitution of alcohols is not an easy thing. Transition metal (TM) catalysis such as Pd&#8208;catalyzed allylic/benzyl substitution and Ir&#8208;catalyzed borrowing hydrogen provides efficient protocols for the direct substitution of alcohols, however, an organic solvent and servely anhydrous conditions are generally required. In recent decade, TM&#8208;catalyzed direct substitution of alcohols in aqueous media was developed as a much greener alternative. In this review, the recent develpoments of this area are summarized. The activation mechanism of alcohols in aqueous reactions are emphatically discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of &#946;&#8208;Phenylalanine Derivatives via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed, C(sp2)&#8208;H (ortho) Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper describes the Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed, picolinamide directing group&#8208;aided C(sp2)&#8208;H (ortho) functionalization of racemic and enantiopure &#946;&#8208;phenylalanines and 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;phenylpropanols (1,3&#8208;amino alcohols). The C(sp2)&#8208;H (ortho) functionalization including arylation, bromination, iodination and alkoxylation was attempted. The C(sp2)&#8208;H (ortho) arylation reactions gave biaryl or terphenyl type &#946;&#8208;phenylalanine scaffolds, halogenation and methoxylation reactions gave ortho C&#8208;H halogenated or methoxylated &#946;&#8208;phenylalanines. Additionally, the C&#8208;H arylation of an ortho&#8208;methyl substituted &#946;&#8208;phenylalanine containing both C(sp2)&#8208;H and remote C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds was investigated. &#946;&#8208;Phenylalanine is an arylated &#946;&#8208;amino acid motif, it is present in various natural products, bioactive molecules, and &#946;&#8208;peptides and it is a precursor to medicinally active compounds. Accordingly, this work contributes to the expansion of the library of unnatural &#946;&#8208;phenylalanine (&#946;&#8208;amino acid) derivatives through site&#8208;selective C&#8208;H functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Synthesis of N&#8208;N Bond Bearing Organic Frameworks by Advanced Heterogeneous Metal Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The most significant task in synthetic organic chemistry is developing organic reactions from a green and sustainable perspective.

         <title>Functional Dithienopyrazines: Structure&#8208;Property Relationships
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient preparation and investigation of syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;dithienopyrazines, which were func&#8208;tionalized with triaraylamine units to provide four different series of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;type materials, is reported. The characterization of the optoelectronic properties gave insights into structure&#8208;property relationships. An application of a dithienopyrazine derivative as model for hole&#8208;transport materials tailored for organic electronic devices has been realized.







Abstract
Dithienopyrazines are only scarcely used as building blocks in organic electronic materials. Here, we report efficient preparation and investigation of syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;dithienopyrazines, which were functionalized with triaraylamine units to provide different series of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;type materials. The characterization of the optoelectronic properties resulted in valuable structure&#8208;property relationships and allowed for the elucidation of the influence of structural effects such as core structure (syn vs anti), type of substituents (directly arylated vs ethynylated aryl), and substitution pattern (&#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208; vs &#946;,&#946;&#8217;&#8208; vs fourfold substitution). Finally, first application of a dithienopyrazine derivative as model for hole&#8208;transport materials tailored for organic electronic devices has been realized.

A practical and efficient transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free selective protocol has been developed for the direct synthesis of chiral directly linked benzothiazole&#8208;dihydroimidazoles with two adjacent tertiary&#8208;quaternary stereocenters through asymmetric Mannich&#8208;type reaction of &#945;&#8208;isocyanoacetates with N&#8208;(2&#8208;benzothiazolyl)imines catalyzed by dihydroquinine&#8208;derived squaramide under the mild conditions for the first time.







Abstract
An organocatalytic asymmetric synthesis of directly linked benzothiazole&#8208;dihydroimidazoles with two adjacent tertiary&#8208;quaternary stereocenters through a Mannich&#8208;type reaction of isocyanoacetates with N&#8208;(2&#8208;benzothiazolyl)imines is disclosed. When employing bifunctional dihydroquinine&#8208;derived squaramide as catalyst, moderate to excellent yields (up to 97&#8201;% yield), moderate diastereoselectivities and excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee) were obtained for a variety of substrates. In addition, the transformation of the resulted directly linked benzothiazole&#8208;dihydroimidazole into highly functionalized &#945;,&#946;&#8208;diamino esters was also demonstrated.

         <title>Fluorinated Analogues to the Pentuloses of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deoxyfluorinated analogues of rare sugars are valuable tools in mechanistic studies on the enzymes involved in their metabolism. Here we describe the first chemical synthesis of 1&#8208;deoxy&#8208;1&#8208;fluoro&#8208;d&#8208;ribulose, 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;d&#8208;ribulose and 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;d&#8208;xylulose as tools to study the non&#8208;oxidative phase of the pentose&#8208;phosphate&#8208;pathway. Additionally, three potential radiolabeling precursors for future fluorine&#8208;18 radio&#8208;fluorinations were synthesized.







Abstract
Fluorinated carbohydrates are valuable tools for enzymological studies due to their increased metabolic stability compared to their non&#8208;fluorinated analogues. Replacing different hydroxyl groups within the same monosaccharide by fluorine allows to influence a wide range of sugar&#8211;receptor interactions and enzymatic transformations. In the past, this principle was frequently used to study the metabolism of highly abundant carbohydrates, while the metabolic fate of rare sugars is still poorly studied. Rare sugars, however, are key intermediates of many metabolic routes, such as the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Here we present the design and purely chemical synthesis of a set of three deoxyfluorinated analogues of the rare sugars d&#8208;xylulose and d&#8208;ribulose: 1&#8208;deoxy&#8208;1&#8208;fluoro&#8208;d&#8208;ribulose (1DFRu), 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;d&#8208;ribulose (3DFRu) and 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;d&#8208;xylulose (3DFXu). Together with a designed set of potential late&#8208;stage radio&#8208;fluorination precursors, they have the potential to become useful tools for studies on the complex equilibria of the non&#8208;oxidative PPP.

         <title>Functionalization of Pyridine and Quinoline Scaffolds Using an Organometallic Li&#8208;, Mg&#8208; and Zn&#8208; Reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review discusses the various methods for functionalizing pyridine and quinoline scaffolds, including direct selective metalation (DoM), halogen/metal exchange reactions, Li, Mg, and Zn insertion, and trans&#8208;metalation approaches, which are then followed by cross&#8208;coupling reactions of the Kumada or Negishi types. Selective deprotonation of aryl or pyridyl/quinolinyl derivatives can be performed using n&#8208;BuLi, LDA, and TMP&#8208;based different organolithium, &#8208;magnesium, and &#8208;zinc reagents. The functionalized pyridine and quinoline&#8208;based heterocyclic compounds were prepared by selectively deprotonating with presenting a directing functional group substituted pyridine/quinoline analogues in the presence of TMP&#8208;bases (TMP&#8208;Li, Mg, Zn reagents). Different aryl or alkyl Li, Mg, and Zn reagents with electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents undergo&#160;transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp2) and C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) types of cross&#8208;coupling reactions with pyridine/quinoline halides under mild conditions with the sustainable process producing complex N&#8208;heterocycles. Using moderate and sustainable reaction conditions, sensitive functional group tolerance, and inexpensive and low toxic chemicals, highly functionalization of pyridine and quinoline&#8208;based bioactive therapeutic scaffolds and natural products was accomplished. Therefore, in this article, we provide a succinct overview of the numerous synthetic strategies and practical methods used by various authors between 2010 and 2023 to functionalize pyridine and quinoline analogues using diverse Li, Mg, and Zn organometallic reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Oxidative [3+2] Cycloaddition for Pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline Synthesis Using a Porphyrin&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porphyrin&#8208;based COF promoted photocatalytic dipolar [3+2] cycloaddition reaction for pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline synthesis is reported. Various substituted pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines were obtained in moderate to good yields via the photocatalytic oxidative [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between tetrahydroisoquinolines and N&#8208;substituted maleimides under aerobic conditions at room temperature.







Abstract
By using a catalytic amount of a porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework (Por&#8208;Ad&#8208;COF) as the efficient recyclable photocatalyst, the photocatalytic oxidative [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between tetrahydroisoquinolines and N&#8208;substituted maleimides was developed under aerobic conditions at room temperature. Various substituted pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines were obtained in moderate to good yields via the dipolar [3+2] cycloaddition and oxidative aromatization cascade process under visible light irradiation. This was the first example to employ the covalent organic framework as the heterogeneous photocatalyst to perform the photocatalytic dipolar [3+2] cycloaddition reaction for the synthesis of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines.

Various substituted pyrrolo[2,1-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]isoquinolines were obtained in moderate to good yields via the photocatalytic oxidative [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between tetrahydroisoquinolines and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-substituted maleimides under aerobic conditions at room temperature.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using a catalytic amount of a porphyrin-based covalent organic framework (Por-Ad-COF) as the efficient recyclable photocatalyst, the photocatalytic oxidative [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between tetrahydroisoquinolines and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-substituted maleimides was developed under aerobic conditions at room temperature. Various substituted pyrrolo[2,1-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]isoquinolines were obtained in moderate to good yields via the dipolar [3+2] cycloaddition and oxidative aromatization cascade process under visible light irradiation. This was the first example to employ the covalent organic framework as the heterogeneous photocatalyst to perform the photocatalytic dipolar [3+2] cycloaddition reaction for the synthesis of pyrrolo[2,1-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]isoquinolines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Comprehensive Study on Redox Behavior and Halogen Exchange in Telluropyran Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Telluropyran derivative T1 can be reversibly oxidized into halogen adducts T1&#8226;X2 (X=Cl, Br, I) with the formation of two Te&#8722;X bonds. The halides in the adducts can be exchanged by lighter ones, but not vice versa. The stabilities of the oxidized products are in the order of T1&#8226;Cl2&gt;T1&#8226;Br2&gt;T1&#8226;I2, which are consistent with the calculated rate constants and energy barriers of the elimination reactions.







Abstract
Incorporation of tellurium into polycyclic compounds may endow them with unique chemical and optoelectronic properties which are not observed in their lighter chalcogen analogues. Herein, a telluropyran&#8208;containing polycyclic compound (T1) synthesized through a ring&#8208;expansion reaction from the corresponding tellurophene analogue can be reversibly oxidized into halogen adducts T1&#8226;X2 (X=Cl, Br, I) with the formation of two Te&#8722;X bonds. Their chemical structures have been verified by two&#8208;dimensional 1H&#8208;1H correlation spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The halogen oxidations of T1 and the reverse thermal eliminations as well as the halogen exchange in halogen adducts T1&#8226;X2 have been systematically investigated and compared by UV&#8208;vis absorption titration, electrochemical measurements, thermogravimetric analysis, and density functional calculations (DFT). The oxidation of Te(II) in T1 to Te(IV) in T1&#8226;X2 results in the switch from aromaticity to nonaromaticity for the six&#8208;membered telluropyran ring, as revealed by nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift calculations. It is also found that the halides in the halogen adducts can be exchanged by lighter ones, but not vice versa. The stabilities of the oxidized products are in the order of T1&#8226;Cl2&gt;T1&#8226;Br2&gt;T1&#8226;I2, which are consistent with the calculated rate constants and energy barriers of the elimination reactions.

         <title>Triethylamine&#8208;Mediated Transformation of Phosphonates into Phosphonamidates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a flexible, straightforward methodology to synthesize phosphonamidates starting from commonly available phosphonates, and demonstrates the use of phosphonylaminium salts to mediate the harsh reactivity of phosphonochloridates. Our methodology is demonstrated on primary amines, secondary amines, ammonium acetate, aniline derivatives and different phosphonate diesters.







Abstract
Organophosphorus compounds such as phosphonamidates are gaining attention across different fields of chemistry, with interesting applications as pharmaceuticals, or pesticides. However, practical application of phosphonamidates is complicated by their difficult syntheses which often involve expensive or unstraightforward reagents and harsh conditions. To remedy these issues, we present a flexible, room temperature synthesis for novel P&#8208;alkylphosphonamidates without the need for intermediary purification. Commonly available phosphonates are first chlorinated by use of oxalyl chloride and phosphonylaminium salts are used to mediate the harsh reactivity of phosphonochloridates, giving rise to the desired products. We demonstrate the compatibility of our protocol with primary and secondary amines, as well as with different phosphonate esters. The proposed pathway also enables the synthesis of primary phosphonamidates using ammonium acetate as a cheap and safe alternative for ammonia. In future research, this protocol will also enable the synthesis of bioactive targets that are incompatible with current protocols.

         <title>N&#8208;Boc&#8208;Protected &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids by 1,3&#8208;Migratory Nitrene C(sp3)&#8722;H Insertion</title>

         <dc:description>
A straightforward two&#8208;step protocol was developed to convert linear or &#945;&#8208;branched carboxylic acids into non&#8208;racemic N&#8208;Boc&#8208;protected &#945;&#8208;monosubstituted (asymmetric catalysis) or &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted (enantioconvergent catalysis) &#945;&#8208;amino acids.







Abstract
N&#8208;Boc&#8208;protected &#945;&#8208;amino acids are synthesized in two steps from linear or branched carboxylic acid feedstocks. In the first step, the carboxylic acid is coupled with tert&#8208;butyl aminocarbonate (BocNHOH) to generate azanyl ester (acyloxycarbamate) RCO2NHBoc. In the second step, this azanyl ester undergoes a stereocontrolled iron&#8208;catalyzed 1,3&#8208;nitrogen migration to generate the N&#8208;Boc&#8208;protected non&#8208;racemic &#945;&#8208;amino acid. This straightforward protocol is applicable to the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;monosubstituted &#945;&#8208;amino acids with aryl, alkenyl, and alkyl side chains. Furthermore, &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted &#945;&#8208;amino acids are accessible in an enantioconvergent fashion from racemic carboxylic acids. The new method is also advantageous for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;deuterated &#945;&#8208;amino acids. N&#8208;Boc&#8208;protected &#945;&#8208;amino acids synthesized using this two&#8208;step protocol are ready&#8208;to&#8208;use building blocks.

         <title>CO2&#8208;Enhanced Production and Synthesis of 2,5&#8208; Furandicarboxylic Acid under CO2 Flow through Henkel Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pathways and rate&#8208;determining steps of the preparation of 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid are identified. The approach includes CO2 flow via the Henkel reaction. The improvements include the mild operating conditions such as atmospheric condition and highest yield among the literatures.







Abstract
The present study investigated the preparation of 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) via the Henkel reaction between furoic acid alkali metal salts and zinc chloride under a continuous CO2 flow at atmospheric pressure. The results obtained were compared with those of previous studies that used high&#8208;pressure conditions or toxic cadmium catalysts. The pathways and rate&#8208;determining steps of the reaction are revealed for the first time. Furthermore, the enhanced formation of FDCA through the promotion of carboxyl exchange and rearrangement during the reaction under a CO2 flow was examined. The CO2&#8208;rich environment afforded a high FDCA yield of 86.30&#8201;%, which is the highest yield obtained to date using the Henkel reaction. The findings of this study offer economically improved conditions for large&#8208;scale FDCA production.

         <title>2&#8208;Nitroimidazole Based PET Tracers: Development of a General Synthetic Approach and Fluorination Methodology</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a general approach for the synthesis of fluorinated nitroimidazoles is described.







Abstract
2&#8208;Nitroimidazole based PET tracers are widely used for non&#8208;invasive hypoxic tumor diagnosis. In this context, we report here a general method based on a central Mitsunobu reaction to easily access 2&#8208;nitroimidazole precursors. Optimization of fluorination conditions is described and successfully applied to the radiofluorination of the 2&#8208;nitroimidazole precursors. Moreover, the radiosynthesis of a new potential hypoxia PET tracer is also described. Finally, this article presents a SFC analytical method allowing both an easy monitoring of the fluorination reactions and the measurement of partition coefficients (logP).

         <dc:description>
Cu(OAc)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O catalyzed ligand free approach for the synthesis of quinazoline via acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of 2&#8208;aminoaryl methanols and nitriles. The same catalytic approach is also highly effective for the construction of quinolines.







Abstract
A copper acetate monohydrate catalyzed simple, effective and economic protocol has been developed for the construction of quinazoline derivatives via acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of easily available 2&#8208;aminoaryl methanols and nitriles. The methodology was also highly effective for the synthesis of medicinally important quinolines analogues. The reactions proceeded in presence of KOtBu in toluene at 110&#8201;&#176;C for 5&#8197;h without the requirement of inert condition, external additives and ligands.

         <title>Synthesis of Substituted Indazole Acetic Acids by N&#8722;N Bond Forming Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the discovery of a novel solvent directed cascade synthesis of biologically relevant indazole acetic acid derivatives is described. Notably, the method is simple, transition&#8208;metal free and provides access to new heterocyclic building&#8208; blocks in moderate to excellent yields.







Abstract
Herein, we report on the discovery and development of novel cascade N&#8722;N bond forming reactions for the synthesis of rare indazole acetic acid scaffolds. This approach allows for convenient synthesis of three distinct indazole acetic acid derivatives (unsubstituted, hydroxy, and alkoxy) by heating 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;nitroaryl)propanoic acids with an appropriate nucleophile/solvent under basic conditions. The reaction tolerates a range of functional groups and electronic effects and, in total, 23&#8197;novel indazole acetic acids were synthesized and characterized. This work offers a valuable strategy for the synthesis of useful scaffolds for drug discovery programs.

         <title>Facile Multicomponent Synthesis of Oxazolidinones from Primary Amines and Cesium (Hydrogen)Carbonate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile multicomponent, catalyst&#8208;free oxazolidinone synthesis from primary aliphatic or aromatic amines and dibromoethane is described. It relies on the usage of cesium carbonate or cesium hydrogencarbonate as the simultaneous base and C1 source, furnishing a broad scope with high yields, including the synthesis of an oxazolidinone&#8208;modified dipeptidyl peptidase 8 inhibitor.







Abstract
A facile multicomponent, catalyst&#8208;free oxazolidinone synthesis from primary aliphatic or aromatic amines, dibromoethane (DBE), and the usage of either cesium carbonate or cesium hydrogencarbonate as the simultaneous base and C1 source is reported. The applicability of this technically simple reaction was demonstrated by a broad scope with generally high yields, enabling concise late&#8208;stage functionalization of amino groups into N&#8208;substituted oxazolidinones. The proposed operating reaction mechanism consists of a first&#8208;step nucleophilic substitution reaction between DBE and the primary amine, followed by the formation of a carbamate or carbonate intermediate and subsequent cyclization. Additional versatility of the herein&#8208;developed protocol has been showcased in a medicinal chemistry approach by the generation of an oxazolidinone&#8208;modified dipeptidyl peptidase 8 (DPP8) inhibitor.

         <title>Carbofluorination of &#960;&#8208;Bonds and Related Reactions Involving Tandem C&#8722;C/C&#8722;F Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review on the carbofluorination of &#960;&#8208;bonds and related transformations involving tandem C&#8722;C/C&#8722;F bond forming reactions is presented. The application of electrophilic fluorine and nucleophilic fluoride reagents in this chemistry is described, as well as recently developed protocols involving the use of fluorinated organic molecules in atom&#8208;economic carbofluorination reactions.







Abstract
Due to the unique properties of C&#8722;F bonds, organofluorine compounds occupy a privileged space in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and polymer industries. Carbofluorination reactions involve the formation of a C&#8722;C and a C&#8722;F bond, typically across a &#960;&#8208;bond or another unsaturated functionality that is revealed upon in situ activation. The design of tailored substrates and new catalyst systems has enabled carbofluorination chemistry to emerge as a promising manifold for the synthesis of unique fluorinated scaffolds. This review covers the application of nucleophilic and electrophilic fluorinating reagents in this chemistry, in addition to recently developed atom&#8208;economical carbofluorination reactions using organofluorine compounds as dual reagents.

         <title>Economical and Environmentally Friendly Organic hydrazone Derivatives Characterized by a Heteroaromatic Core as Potential Hole Transporting Materials in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;rich hydrazone&#8208;based molecules centred on thiophene or pyrrole &#960;&#8208;bridges have been investigated in their optical and electrochemical properties as potential hole transport material for use in perovskite solar cells. A brief cost analysis has also been carried out to evaluate the sustainability of their synthetic process.







Abstract
A series of organic electron&#8208;rich &#960;&#8208;bridged symmetric hydrazones, composed of two donor moieties connected through a thiophene&#8208; or a pyrrole&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;spacer, has been synthesized as a suitable alternative to 2,2&#8217;,7,7&#8217;&#8208;tetrakis[N,N&#8208;di(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino]&#8208;9,9&#8217;&#8208;spirobifluorene (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD), considered the benchmark hole transporting material (HTM) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The cheap synthetic protocol is suitable for potential large&#8208;scale production. All the compounds were characterized, showing good energy levels alignments with the perovskite and very close energy levels to the Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. Furthermore, computational analysis confirmed the electrochemical trend observed. The costs of synthesis were estimated, as well as the produced waste to synthesise the final HTMs, underlining the low impact of these compounds on the environment with the respect to Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. Overall, the relevant electrochemical properties and the low cost of the synthetic approaches allow these compounds to be a greener and easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize alternative to the Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD for industrial development of PSCs.

         <dc:description>The catalyst&#8208;free electrochemical halogenation and trifluoromethylation of 4H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones was realized under external oxidant&#8208;free conditions. This strategy provides an easy and green access to functionalized new 4H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives with broad scope, good functional group tolerance and high regioselectivity.</dc:description>
