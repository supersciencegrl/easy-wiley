         <title>The Last Fortress of Tin&#8217;s Tyranny &#8211; Protodenitration of Nitroalkanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protodenitration, a direct reduction of nitroalkanes to corresponding alkanes, already spans two centuries and is enabled by various reagents. This mini&#8208;review provides a historical development of the fundamental transformation and highlights the governing position of the Ono&#8208;Tanner reaction employing tributyltin hydride. Due to the unchallenged dominance of the toxic tributyltin hydride and environmentally unpopular solvents sharply contrasting with modern ecological trends, the current situation was dubbed &#8220;the last fortress of tin&#8217;s tyranny.&#8221;</dc:description>

         <title>Carpet beater molecules: synthesis and characterization of functional of hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;benzocoronene&#8208;alkyne coupling products</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Within the scope of this paper nine p&#8208;expanded mono&#8208;substituted 5,8,11,14,17&#8208;pentakis&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzo&#8208;coronenes (HBC) are introduced. 2&#8208;Iodo&#8208;5,8,11,14,17&#8208;pentakis&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene served as precursor and was reacted with ethynyltrimethylsilane in a Sonogashira coupling reaction. The acetylene unit is used as a linker and can undergo another Sonogashira coupling reaction combining different phenyl coupling partners with the HBC core. The electron&#8208;withdrawing groups such as nitrile, pyridine and carbonyl species (aldehyde, methylester, carbonic acid) as well as the three quinoxaline based species (diphenylquinoxaline, dibenzop[a,c]phenazine, phenanthrol[4&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;a,b,c]phenazine) serve as substitution moieties. Their influence on the optoelectronic properties were investigated via UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy demonstrating a maximum redshift of 7 nm compared to starting compound HBC&#8208;I. As for the phenanthrol[4&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;a,b,c]phenazine substituted HBC a dramatic decrease in the intensity of the absorption of the UV/Vis spectrum was observed. The fluorescence spectroscopy pointed out that the dibenzo[a,c]phenazine and phenanthrol[4&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;a,b,c]phenazine substitution changed the spectra to one broad peak departing from the characteristic HBC&#8208;like emission pattern.</dc:description>

         <title>tBu4NCl/K2S2O8 System Induced C&#8208;2 Functionalization of 8&#8208;Aminoquinoline Amides with Primary Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metal and light&#8208;free Minisci&#8208;type acylation approach of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline amides with general primary alcohols was demonstrated under tBu4NCl/K2S2O8 system. Simultaneously, the C2&#8208;H alkylation can be realized by accident for special benzyl alcohols bearing strong electron&#8208;donating groups. Most N&#8208;heterocycles were also compatible to afford corresponding acylated products. Furthermore, The mechanism investigation reveals that chlorine radical induced the original ketyl radical generation through abstracting the &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H from the alcohols, then underwent nucleophilic carbon&#8208;centered radicals addition, deprotonation and oxidation to provide the target acylation products.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyzed Synthesis of 3&#8208;Substituted Phthalides: A Key Access to (&#177;)&#8208;Herbaric Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we investigated a new organophotocatalyzed protocol enabling the preparation of 3&#8208;substituted phthalides. From this work, the 1,2,3,5&#8208;Tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN) turned out to be a particularly efficient organophotocatalyst to promote lactone formation under visible&#8208;light irradiation within 6&#8197;h. Ultimately, it was found that this protocol could enable the formation of racemic herbaric acid.







Abstract
An efficient organophotocatalyzed protocol was developed for the preparation of 3&#8208;substituted phthalides. The presented transformation was performed under particularly mild conditions within 6&#8197;h and was ultimately applied to a precursor of the herbaric acid.

         <title>Combining Matteson Homologations and Claisen Rearrangements &#8211; An Efficient Protocol for Amino Acid Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Matteson homologation with vinyl nucleophiles can be combined with the zinc&#8208;chelated ester enolate Claisen rearrangement to obtain highly functionalized unusual amino acids. The substitution pattern of the side chain can be determined by variation of the nucleophiles used in the homologation steps.







Abstract
The Matteson homologation with vinyl nucleophiles was found to be an efficient and versatile protocol for the synthesis of substituted chiral allyl alcohols in a highly stereoselective fashion. These alcohols can be coupled with N&#8208;protected glycine and subsequently subjected to zinc&#8208;chelated ester&#8208;enolate Claisen rearrangements to yield highly substituted unsaturated amino acids. By varying the nucleophiles used in the Matteson homologations, the method allows control over not only the stereogenic centers but also the side&#8208;chain substitution pattern in the newly formed &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated amino acids.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed and PTSA&#8208;Promoted Cycloisomerization of Ynamides to Access Pyrrole Substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a new ynamide scaffold has been designed, synthesized and later applied in a gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization reaction to access pyrrole containing &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones in low&#8208;to&#8208;moderate yields. Interestingly, the trans product has been obtained as a major isomer.







Abstract
Substituted pyrroles are prevalent aromatic ring systems encountered in numerous natural products and bioactive molecules. Herein, a novel ynamide scaffold has been designed, synthesized and subsequently applied to an unprecedented gold&#8208;catalyzed and para&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA)&#8208;assisted cascade cycloisomerization reaction for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;pyrrole substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. Notably, the reaction is stereoselective, offering E&#8208;isomer as major product with low to moderate yield.

         <title>Flexible Synthesis of Benzofuranones from o&#8208;Alkynyl Phenols or Benzofurans</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzofuranones are attractive synthetic targets in medicinal and natural products. The cycloisomerization of o&#8208;alkynyl phenol to benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one is reported here using gold(I) and Selectfluor. This benzofuranone can also be obtained from benzofuran without a gold catalyst. This study presents two appealing synthetic methods for benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones that use readily available starting materials, have high chemoselectivity and operate under very mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Transfer Hydro&#8208;debromination of Aryl Bromides with Ethanol</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A convenient PNP pincer manganese catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of bromides to corresponding debrominated aryl compounds using ethanol as hydrogen sources are demonstrated. Importantly, the application of biomass&#8208;derived ethanol highlights the sustainability of the methodology. Ideal results are achieved by applying the 6&#8208;phenyl substituted triazine&#8208;based P i prN5P i pr manganese pincer catalyst, which allows the debromination of various aryl bromides with good yields. Notably, the process also occurs with bromides derived from several classes of natural products and bioactive compounds, such as citronellol, diacetone fructose, cholesterol, and vitamin E.</dc:description>

Aromatic aldehyde&#8208;derived  N  &#8208;tosylhydrazones produced terminal and internal  N  &#8208;allylated products, in which the terminal products are the main. While ketone&#8208;derived tosylhydrazones produced only terminal addition products.

         <title>Self&#8208;Catalyzed&#160;Hydroxyl&#8208;Yne Click Reaction: A Powerful Tool toward Red&#8208;Emitting Nontraditional Small Organic Luminogens</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nontraditional small organic luminogens (NTSOLs) without classic conjugated chromophores have attracted significant attention. However, the design and synthesis of NTSOLs with fluorescence in the red region remain significantly challenging. In this study, we established a self&#8208;catalyzed hydroxyl&#8208;yne click reaction for preparing long&#8208;wavelength and red&#8208;emitting NTSOLs. Owing to their perfect reaction selectivity, high efficiency, and excellent universality, a series of compounds with well&#8208;defined structures were obtained in high yields. Moreover, the obtained compounds showed concentration&#8208;enhanced and excitation&#8208;dependent emission characteristics. The compounds also exhibited dramatical chemical structure&#8208;dependent and aggregation&#8208;induced red&#8208;shifted fluorescence properties, based on which we successfully obtained red&#8208;emitting NTSOLs by simply adjusting chemical structure and concentration. Most importantly, the compounds show good cell staining ability, which can be used in cell imaging. Thus, this study provides a facile strategy for the synthesis of red&#8208;emitting NTSOLs and expands the methodology library of both self&#8208;catalyzed click reactions and nontraditional luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Rearrangement of Indoles to Spirooxindoles in Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical method for the oxidative rearrangement of indoles to spirooxindoles in employing an undivided, single pass flow cell is reported. The electrochemical reactions require no chemical oxidants and can be scaled up easily without need for re&#8208;optimization of reaction conditions by continuous production with parallel reactors.







Abstract
The oxidative rearrangement of indoles induced by various chemical oxidants is a frequently employed method for the construction of spirooxindole structures. Herein, we report an electrochemical method for the oxidative rearrangement of indoles to spirooxindoles in continuous flow. The electrochemical reactions require no chemical oxidants and can be scaled up easily without need for re&#8208;optimization of reaction conditions by passing more starting material through parallel reactors.

A series of dihydroazulene/vinylheptafulvene (DHA/VHF) photoswitches was prepared and studied in various media regarding their photophysical, photochemical, and thermal properties. To pave the way towards the use of DHAs as building blocks in bio(macro)molecules, we synthesized peptide conjugates including the 17&#8208;amino acid ALFA peptide and found excellent switching properties of the biohybrid constructs in aqueous media.&#8201;







Abstract
Light&#8208;responsive molecules have seen a major advance in modulating biological functions in recent years. Especially photoswitches are highly attractive building blocks due to the reversible nature of their light&#8208;mediated reactivity. They are frequently used to affect both the properties of small bioactive compounds and biomacromolecules if incorporated suitably. Despite their success in a plethora of applications, only a limited set of photochromic core structures is routinely employed and a large number of photochromic couples are under&#8208;investigated in biological context. Broadening the toolbox of photoswitches available to modulate biological activity would open new avenues and unlock the full potential of photoswitchable molecules for biological studies. In this work, we explore the photochemical and thermal properties of the dihydroazulene/vinylheptafulvene photochromic couple as peptide conjugates in aqueous environment.

         <title>Tuning the Electro&#8208;Optical Properties of Mixed&#8208;Halide Trityl Radicals Bearing para&#8208;Brominated Positions through Halogen Substitution</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new mixed&#8208;halide trityl radicals bearing p&#8208;brominated positions were synthesized in good yield from halogenated triphenylmethanes obtained by multistep Friedel&#8208;Crafts reactions. Their electrochemical and spectroscopic properties were reported as well as quantum&#8208;chemical calculations carried out to supplement the experimental investigation. The most blue&#8208;shifted emission among trityl radicals was achieved for the highly fluorinated trityl radical.







Abstract
In this work, the synthesis and characterization of two new trityl radicals bearing two p&#8208;brominated positions, i.&#8201;e. the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;((perchlorophenyl)methylene)bis(1,3,5&#8208;tribromobenzene) radical and the 6,6&#8242;&#8208;((perchlorophenyl)methylene)bis(3&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene) radical, are presented. Slightly modifying the strategy typically used for the synthesis of non&#8208;symmetric mixed&#8208;halide trityl radicals, we were able to considerably increase the reaction yield for the radical precursors. In addition, for the first time the electro&#8208;optical properties of a highly fluorinated trityl radical were studied, achieving the most blue&#8208;shifted emission for a trityl radical reported up to now. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations carried out to supplement the experimental investigation support the electrochemical and spectroscopic data as well as rationalize the observed blue shift of the highly fluorinated species.

A Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed annulation reaction of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazoles with glyoxals via C&#8722;H bond activation followed by intramolecular cyclization affording structurally diverse 5&#8208;hydroxyimidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolin&#8208;6(5H)&#8208;ones has been developed.

Abstract
Synthesis of novel 5&#8208;hydroxyimidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolin&#8208;6(5H)&#8208;ones have been achieved by Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed reaction of 2&#8208;arylimidazoles with arylglyoxals. The method provided moderate to good yields of 5&#8208;hydroxyimidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolin&#8208;6(5H)&#8208;ones and is amenable to gram&#8208;scale synthesis. The reaction involves imidazole&#8208;directed Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;dicarbonylation followed by nucleophilic cyclization of the NH&#8208;group with the carbonyl group. Photophysical properties of the newly synthesized 5&#8208;hydroxyimidazo&#8208;[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolin&#8208;6(5H)&#8208;ones were investigated.

         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;fast continuous&#8208;flow photo&#8208;thiol&#8208;ene reactions on cinchona alkaloids are possible through a fine control of the reactive conformation in solution. Switching the hydroxyl group at C9 by a phenyl carbamate allows thiol&#8208;ene functionalization of cinchona alkaloids in less than 2.5&#8197;minutes with organic thiols at 32&#8201;&#176;C ant under light irradiation at 365&#8197;nm.







Abstract
In this work, we describe ultra&#8208;fast continuous flow photo&#8208;thiol&#8208;ene reactions on cinchona alkaloids derivatives through a control of the reactive conformation in solution. Flow thiol&#8208;ene reactions proceed at 32&#8201;&#176;C under light irradiation at 365&#8197;nm and require only 2.5&#8197;minutes of residence time to reach completion. The short path length of the tubular flow photochemical reactor, which maximizes and homogenizes the photon flux, associated to the fine tuning of the reactive conformation of cinchona alkaloids in solution are the main reasons for the high rates observed. The predominant conformation in solution of cinchona alkaloids was adjusted through the substitution of the hydroxyl group at C9 by a phenyl carbamate function.

Completely stereoselective synthesis of C&#8208;azanucleosides was achieved. Assistance of the sterically hindered pentylidene acetal worked well under electrochemical conditions, and redox&#8208;induced N&#8208;&#945; hydroxylation and continuous C&#8208;glycosidation gave desired C&#8208;azanucleosides with high &#946;&#8208;selectivity (&gt;98&#8201;%).







Abstract
Herein, we report a practical method for de novo preparation of imino&#8208;d&#8208;ribitol and C&#8208;azanucleosides. The diastereopure Imino&#8208;d&#8208;ribitol was synthesized on a multigram scale by simple manipulation, and late&#8208;stage anomeric derivatization by regio&#8208; and diastereoselective electrochemical C(sp3)&#8722;H activation enabled the efficient synthesis of the corresponding C&#8208;azanucleosides with high &#946;&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Arylnaphthalene Lignans through a Photochemical Key Step</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total syntheses of arylnaphthalene lignans (ANL) Vitrofolal E (1), Noralashinol C (2), and Ternifoliuslignan E (3) are described. These natural products have in common a missing substituent in 2&#8208;position of the naphthalene skeleton (2H&#8208;ANL). The key step of the syntheses is the Photo&#8208;Dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (PDDA) reaction between arylalkyne moieties, which are connected by a suberate linker unit. The reasons for the regioselectivity of the photochemical ring closure were investigated by means of DFT methods.







Abstract
The total syntheses of three arylnaphthalene lignans (ANLs) were developed: Vitrofolal E (1), Noralashinol C (2), and Ternifoliuslignan E (3). These natural products have in common a missing substituent in 2&#8208;position of the naphthalene moiety (2H&#8208;ANLs). The key step of these syntheses is a regioselective intramolecular Photo&#8208;Dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (PDDA) reaction with (1,7)naphthalenophanes as primary products. A further improvement of the photochemical step was achieved by triplet sensitization with xanthone, allowing the use of more efficient UVA lamps. It should be noted that this work is a continuation of a previous publication about the total synthesis of lignans using the PDDA reaction.[1]

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox/copper catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction of 1,3&#8208;enynes, trifluoromethylaminating reagent, and TMSCN has been established. A variety of trifluoromethylaminated allenes were obtained in good yields and excellent regioselectivity.







Abstract
A photoredox/copper&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;enynes with readily available trifluoromethylaminating reagent and TMSCN was developed. This reaction proceeded at mild conditions, affording the corresponding trifluoromethylaminated allenes in good yields and excellent regioselectivity. The synthetic application of the resulting products has also been demonstrated by the transformation to N&#8722;CF3 oxazolidinones.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Oxetanes Based on the Combination of Azides and Tetrazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several new energetic oxetane derivatives with higher nitrogen contents than previously reported in the literature were synthesized and characterized. An azide group and a tetrazole moiety were introduced into the starting material oxetan&#8208;3&#8208;one to obtain a 3&#8208;disubstituted oxetane. The tetrazole ring of this energetic oxetane was further methylated, aminated and hydroxylated.







Abstract
Literature known energetic oxetane derivatives have a nitrogen content of up to 49.98&#8201;%. Through the introduction of azide and tetrazole functionalities attached to an oxetane ring, energetic oxetanes with higher nitrogen contents than previously reported in the literature were obtained. The newly synthesized oxetane derivatives were extensively characterized via 1H NMR, 13C{1H} NMR, 14N NMR, 15N NMR, 1H&#8208;15N HMBC, FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy and/or DTA. Their crystal structures were elucidated using X&#8208;ray diffraction, their sensitivities towards impact, friction and electrostatic discharge were determined and their energetic properties were calculated using the EXPLO5 code.

         <title>Correlation between Absorption and Substitution of Photochromic 1,2&#8208;Bis(thienyl)ethenes (BTEs) Using Modified Spectroscopic Hammett Equations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Hammett&#8208;Brown substituent constants of &#945;'&#8208;substituted BTEs (open and closed) correlate linearly with the excitation energies of the absorption maxima applying the spectroscopic Hammett equation.







Abstract
Series of photochromic 1,2&#8208;bis(thienyl)ethenes possessing perfluorocyclopentene backbones, either hydrogen or methyl groups at the &#946;&#8208;positions of the thiophenes, and a variety of substituents in their &#945;'&#8208;positions were prepared, which cover the range from electron&#8208;donating to electron&#8208;withdrawing (Me, &#8722;CH2OH, &#8722;OTBS, &#8722;TMS, &#8722;Br, 1,3&#8208;dioxan&#8208;2&#8208;yl, pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl, &#8722;CH2OH, &#8722;COOH). As a linear free energy relationship the spectroscopic Hammett equation gives fair to excellent fits to the excitation energy of the absorption maxima of the ring&#8208;opened as well as the ring&#8208;closed forms of the BTEs, when Hammett substituent constants &#963;p were replaced by Brown's modified substituent constants &#963;p+ and &#963;p&#8722;. Vice versa, hitherto unknown Hammett&#8208;Brown substituent constants can be estimated from the UV spectra. Furthermore, we compared the experimentally measured absorption maxima with values which we calculated by three different methods (DFT STEOM&#8208;DLPNO&#8208;CCSD/def2&#8208;TZVPP, TD&#8208;DFT &#969;B97X&#8208;D3/6&#8208;31G*, TD&#8208;DFT &#969;B97X&#8208;D3/6&#8208;311++G**).

         <title>Synthesis of Naphthyridine and Azepine Backbones through Formal [4+3] and [4+2] Annulation via Cascade Ring&#8208;Opening/Cyclization Reaction of 2H&#8208;Azirines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the cascade ring&#8208;opening cyclization of 2H&#8208;azirines and enolized&#8208;o&#8208;alkynylquinoline carbaldehydes as a bifunctional precursor for the synthesis of naphthyridine and azepine skeletons in the presence of zinc catalyst is reported. This method offers a practical and straightforward approach for the construction of novel fused heterocyclic rings through formal [4+3], and [4+2] annulation by forming two new bonds (C=N, and C=C bond), and cleavage of 2H&#8208;azirine C&#8722;C bond in a single step.







Abstract
A zinc&#8208;mediated cascade ring&#8208;opening cyclization of 2H&#8208;azirines and enolized&#8208;o&#8208;alkenylquinoline carbaldehydes for the synthesis of naphthyridine and azepine skeletons has been disclosed. The regioselectivity of the reaction can be switched from a seven&#8208; to a six&#8208;membered ring by shifting from two&#8208; to monosubstituted 2H&#8208;azirine. This transformation involves the construction of two C=C and C=N double bonds. This report describes 2H&#8208;azirine&#8208;dependent cascade annulation in formal [4+3], and [4+2] cyclization reactions.

&lt;p&gt;In this work, the cascade ring-opening cyclization of 2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-azirines and enolized-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-alkynylquinoline carbaldehydes as a bifunctional precursor for the synthesis of naphthyridine and azepine skeletons in the presence of zinc catalyst is reported. This method offers a practical and straightforward approach for the construction of novel fused heterocyclic rings through formal [4+3], and [4+2] annulation by forming two new bonds (C=N, and C=C bond), and cleavage of 2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-azirine C&#8722;C bond in a single step.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A zinc-mediated cascade ring-opening cyclization of 2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-azirines and enolized-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-alkenylquinoline carbaldehydes for the synthesis of naphthyridine and azepine skeletons has been disclosed. The regioselectivity of the reaction can be switched from a seven- to a six-membered ring by shifting from two- to monosubstituted 2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-azirine. This transformation involves the construction of two C=C and C=N double bonds. This report describes 2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-azirine-dependent cascade annulation in formal [4+3], and [4+2] cyclization reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Azidoesterification of Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient electrochemical metal&#8208;catalyzed protocol has been developed for the azidoesterification of alkenes, providing a practical method for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acid derivatives.







Abstract
We report an efficient and sustainable electrocatalytic approach for azidoesterification of alkenes. The reaction proceeds by electrochemical iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of commercially available carbazates to produce alkoxycarbonyl radicals. Upon addition across alkenes, the generated transient carbon&#8208;centered radicals get trapped by azido metal complexes to furnish the alkene difunctionalization products. This mild, operationally simple protocol transforms a wide variety of alkenes into the corresponding &#946;&#8208;azido esters in good to excellent yields, thereby providing a practical access to &#946;&#8208;amino acid derivatives from simple and readily available starting materials.

         <title>Highly Selective Catalyst&#8208;Free Oxidative Synthesis of N&#8208;Formamides from C2&#8208; and C3&#8208;Feedstocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different C2&#8208; and C3&#8208;feedstocks are explored, out of these, 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone (DHA) and glyoxal (GLYOX) as carbon sources provide quantitative yields of N&#8208;formamides at optimal conditions using TBHP as oxidant with minimal carbon loss by applying a carbon source:amine ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;2. This methodology also works well on 5 gram substrate scale producing yields of N&#8208;formanilide product up to 87&#8201;%.







Abstract
The application of bio&#8208;derived feedstocks as building blocks in organic syntheses holds great value with goals of high product yield and minimizing carbon loss. As contribution to this effort, present work explores 5 different C2&#8208; and C3&#8208;feedstocks (derived from biomass and conventional sources) such as glycerol (GLY), 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone (DHA), ethylene glycol (EG), glycolic acid (GLYAC) and glyoxal (GLYOX) as carbon sources for highly selective, catalyst&#8208;free oxidative synthesis of N&#8208;formamides from primary and secondary amines. Both DHA and GLYOX showed the best carbon efficiency through carbon source: amine ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;2, resulting in 100&#8201;% selectivity of N&#8208;formanilide with tert&#8208;butyl hydrogen peroxide (TBHP) as the oxidant. GLYOX was applied further for synthesizing a N&#8208;formamide library of 21 substrates exemplifying substantial yields ranging from 68&#8211;98&#8201;%. Moreover, pilot scalability of this methodology achieved a yield of 87&#8201;% and 72&#8201;% for aniline substrate at 5&#8208;gram scale using GLYOX and DHA respectively in 24&#8197;hours.

Dual catalysis is one of the most powerful strategies for the development of chemical reactions in organic synthesis. This Perspective aims to introduce the different categories of dual catalytic systems and demonstrate their benefits in constructing new chemical bonds and enhanced stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Dual catalysis is one of the most powerful strategies for the development of chemical reactions in organic synthesis. This strategy can be divided into cooperative catalysis, relay catalysis, and sequential catalysis according to the actual mode of operation and the communication between the catalysts. In recent years, such strategy has been applied in a large number of studies since it has the advantages of: 1)&#8197;increasing reactivity and enabling challenging transformations; 2)&#8197;offering a powerful way of controlling the stereoselectivity of asymmetric reactions, which is challenging for traditional catalytic systems; 3)&#8197;catalyze the stereodivergent synthesis of molecules bearing one or more stereocenters from the same starting materials. This Perspective, which intends to introduce the reader to EurJOC special collection on Dual Catalysis , aims to summarize and introduce the different categories of dual catalysis and demonstrate their benefits in constructing new chemical bonds in a selective manner. Finally, current challenges and new trends in dual catalysis will be also presented.

         <title>Novel Approaches To Design Glycan&#8208;Based Antibacterial Inhibitors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sweet and sticky: This review describes recent advances in the synthesis and application of homo&#8208;and heterovalent glycan&#8208;scaffolds as potential candidates for efficient bacteria lectin inhibition. To study and address the many complex molecular mechanisms involved in multivalent lectin binding events, novel glycoconjugate designs and fine&#8208;tunable glycomaterials have been developed.







Abstract
The interactions between bacterial lectins and carbohydrates on the host cell surface can mediate bacterial adhesion, invasion, and immune evasion. Multivalency plays a key role in these binding events. However, additional molecular mechanisms greatly impact multivalent binding recognition. To develop specific and effective bacterial inhibitors, a deeper understanding of the complex underlying mechanisms of bacterial adhesion processes is necessary. By interfering with bacterial adhesion, synthetic multivalent glycoconjugates do not only have the potential to improve or replace antibiotic treatments, but also represent useful tools to study carbohydrate&#8208;pathogen interactions. In this review, we highlight a few recent advances in the synthesis and application of synthetic glycan&#8208;based scaffolds to uncover the nature of glycan&#8208;bacteria interactions and to design efficient bacterial inhibitors.

         <title>Recent Developments and Trends in Asymmetric Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric organocatalysis has developed spectacularly over the last decades, and its general importance was recently highlighted by the 2021 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. This Perspective aims at providing a brief historical introduction to this field, as well as discussing selected advanced recent examples underscoring the diversity and potential of this still growing and vibrant field.







Abstract
Asymmetric organocatalysis has experienced a long and spectacular way since the early reports over a century ago by von Liebig, Knoevenagel and Bredig, showing that small (chiral) organic molecules can catalyze (asymmetric) reactions. This was followed by impressive first highly enantioselective reports in the second half of the last century, until the hype initiated in 2000 by the milestone publications of MacMillan and List, which finally culminated in the 2021 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. This short Perspective aims at providing a brief introduction to the field by first looking on the historical development and the more classical methods and concepts, followed by discussing selected advanced recent examples that opened new directions and diversity within this still growing field.

         <title>Boron Catalysis in the Transformation of Carboxylic Acids and Carboxylic Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in boron catalysis with non&#8208;activated carboxylic acids, amides, and esters are summarized. Dehydrative amidation, reduction by silane reagents, C&#8722;C bond formation at &#945;&#8208;position, heteroatom&#8208;functionalization at &#945;&#8208;position, 1,4&#8208;addition, and other types of reactions are discussed with overview of mechanistic insights obtained during the past decade.







Abstract
Carboxylic acids, amides, and esters are ubiquitous motifs in functional organic molecules. However, the reactivities of these high oxidation state carbonyl compounds are far lower than ketones and aldehydes, and catalysts applicable to transform this class of carbonyl compounds are limited. On the other hand, boron catalysts have found various applications in the transformation of carbonyl compounds by taking advantage of the unique properties derived from their vacant p&#8208;orbitals. The continuous advancement of boron catalysis has realized several unprecedented direct transformations of carboxylic acids, amides, and esters in the past decade. In this review, representative achievements of boron catalysis are summarized according to reaction types by focusing on their applications to non&#8208;activated carboxylic acids, amides, and esters.

         <title>Designs, synthesis, and biomedical applications of glycotripods for targeting trimeric lectins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the last decades, various efforts have been made to synthesize optimal glycotripods for targeting trimeric glycoproteins like asialoglycoprotein receptor, hemagglutinin, and langerin. All these trimeric glycoproteins have sugar binding pockets which are highly selective for a particular carbohydrate ligand. Optimized glycotripods are high affinity binders and have been used for delivering drugs or even applied as drug candidates. The selection of the tripodal base scaffold together with the length and flexibility of the linker between the scaffold and sugar residue, as important design parameters are discussed in this review.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized Proline&#8208;Derived Azabicycloalkane Amino Acids and Their Applications in Drug Discovery: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>After the first synthesis reported in 1994, azabicycloalkane&#160;amino acids have raised increasing interest, becoming one of the most important classes of constrained dipeptide mimics. Their incorporation into peptidomimetic structures allowed the obtainment of a wide range of biologically active compounds. Over the years, different research groups have worked at the development of synthetic strategies to gain these rigid dipeptide surrogates, nevertheless, methods affording functionalized and &#8220;easy&#8208;to&#8208;functionalize&#8221; derivatives are quite less described. The presence of a derivatizable azabicycloalkanone core could allow the introduction of chemical modifications aimed to improve the pharmaceutical properties of a biologically active compound without the need for redesigning its chemical synthesis. This account has collected and critically surveyed relevant approaches to the synthesis of functionalized azabicycloalkane&#160;amino acids, focusing the attention on the period of 2010 to the present. Moreover, recent applications of these compounds in drug discovery will be discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Domino Heck&#8208;Suzuki Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exocyclic tetra&#8208;substituted carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds in uniform configuration and creation of tertiary or quaternary stereogenic centers in a diastereoselective or enantioselective manner &#8211; these are structural motives that are accessible by a cascade consisting of a Heck reaction and subsequent Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling with suitable palladium catalysts that guarantee a high degree of stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Palladium catalysis enables efficient and versatile domino reactions that are initiated by an intramolecular Mizoroki&#8208;Heck reaction and then terminated by a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling. The stereochemistry of this cascade is concerned under three aspects: Firstly, as stereoselective formation of carbon&#8208;carbon&#8208;double bonds, when the initial carbometalation occurs at an alkyne moiety. Secondly as diastereoselective and thirdly enantioselective formation of stereogenic carbon centers when the intramolecular Heck step is directed to an alkene moiety. Valuable protocols lead to &#8211; otherwise not easily accomplished &#8211; stereo control in the formation of tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted double bonds according to the first conception. The diastereoselective versions permit the formation of multiple stereocenters in mono&#8208; and polycycles. Enantioselective protocols were developed only recently. The fact that the newly created stereocenters are highly&#8208;substituted, tertiary or quaternary ones, makes the methods that are presented in this review useful and versatile tools in synthesis.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Bis(naphthofuran)&#8208;Fused [7]Helicene Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Late&#8208;stage cyclization of the McMurry dimerized product furnished oxa[7]helicene with functional group tunability.







Abstract
Novel benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,3&#8208;b&#8242;]dinaphthofuran (oxa[7]helicene) with various substituents in the central ring were designed and successfully synthesized based on the late stage central ring formation strategy from naphthofuranoneby using an efficient McMurry coupling or Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation. The photochemical properties of helicenes were evaluated by UV&#8208;Visible absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy, while electrochemical behaviour including their energy profile were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and DFT calculations. According to the computational study, substituents on the central ring could influence both electron delocalization and MO distribution of oxa[7]helicenes resulting in the change in charge transporting ability. In comparison to the parent carbo[7]helicene, the furan unit in conjunction with substituents on helical system caused the bathochromic shift with different absorption pattern and exhibited higher fluorescence quantum yield (&#981;f up to 0.63). These new materials showed promising characteristics in optoelectronic application.

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid Promoted Sulfonylation of Propargylic Alcohols: Synthesis of Triaryl Allenyl Sulfones under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;promoted sulfonylation of propargylic alcohols with sodium sulfinates as a sulfonyl source was developed for the synthesis of triaryl allenyl sulfones. This transformation proceeds well to give various triaryl&#8208;substituted allenyl sulfones in moderate to excellent yields under mild conditions.







Abstract
An efficient and practical approach for the synthesis of triaryl allenyl sulfones from easily accessible propargylic alcohols was developed, by using sodium sulfinates as a sulfonyl source in the presence of Br&#248;nsted acid. The reaction proceeded via allenyl carbocation as the key intermediate and was followed by a nucleophilic attack of sodium sulfinates to produce allenyl sulfones in moderate to excellent yields.

Abstract
The efficient three&#8208;component cascade coupling reaction of 3&#8208;haloisoquinolines, haloalkanes, and sp3&#8208;carbon nucleophiles (acetophenone or nitromethane) led to a series of structurally novel 1,2&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;3&#8208;isoquinolinones through the formation of C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2), C&#8722;N, and C=O bonds.

This work reports the visible light mediated oxidative coupling of aryl methyl amines with o&#8208;phenylenediamine, 2&#8208;aminobenzenethiol and 2&#8208;aminobenzamide to benzimidazoles, benzothiazoles, and quinazolinones in one pot using scalable and reusable heterogeneous Ba&#8208;doped CoMoO4 nanoparticles under air atmosphere.







Abstract
Herein we report a simple and efficient oxidative coupling of various aryl methyl amines with diverse coupling partners, such as o&#8208;phenylenediamine (benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine), 2&#8208;aminobenzenethiol and 2&#8208;aminobenzamide, to synthesize the corresponding heterocycles using scalable and reusable heterogeneous catalysts under visible light irradiation. A systematic investigation led to the synthesis of benzimidazoles, benzothiazoles and quinazolinones under air atmosphere in very good to excellent yields. The strategy is atom economical and found to be tolerance towards different functional groups, and wide range of substrate scope. Furthermore, the methodology was demonstrated for its suitability on scale up and reusability. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the analysis of band structures of pristine and Ba doped CoMoO4 systems showed that the doping of Ba in place of Co improved the catalytic performance of the system.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein we report a simple and efficient oxidative coupling of various aryl methyl amines with diverse coupling partners, such as &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-phenylenediamine (benzene-1,2-diamine), 2-aminobenzenethiol and 2-aminobenzamide, to synthesize the corresponding heterocycles using scalable and reusable heterogeneous catalysts under visible light irradiation. A systematic investigation led to the synthesis of benzimidazoles, benzothiazoles and quinazolinones under air atmosphere in very good to excellent yields. The strategy is atom economical and found to be tolerance towards different functional groups, and wide range of substrate scope. Furthermore, the methodology was demonstrated for its suitability on scale up and reusability. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the analysis of band structures of pristine and Ba doped CoMoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; systems showed that the doping of Ba in place of Co improved the catalytic performance of the system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
An efficient approach to (2R,3S)&#8208;3&#8208;siloxy&#8208;2&#8208;phenylethynyl substituted pyrrolidines was developed through Y(OTf)3&#8208;CuI catalyzed N&#8208;&#945; alkynylation of cyclic imines (1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;e) with alkynes 2&#8201;a&#8211;s.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Electrochemical Synthesis of (Hetero)Aryl Trifluoromethyl Selenides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes an electrochemical nickel&#8208;catalyzed reaction of trifluoromethylselenolation of various aryl iodides, catalytic in electron, and using [Me4N]+[SeCF3]&#8722; as reagent. A Ni(0)&#8208;based catalytic cycle was proposed on the basis on electrochemical investigations.







Abstract
A convenient and efficient approach for the construction of aryl trifluoromethyl selenoethers from aryl iodides under mild conditions is reported. Electrochemical activation of stable and inexpensive NiBr2bipy (bipy &#8211; bipyridine) complex instead of labile Ni(COD)2 (COD &#8211; cyclooctadiene) catalyst. [NMe4][SeCF3] is employed as shelf&#8208;stable source of SeCF3 fragment. The reaction tolerates a wide range of substrates, including modification of drug&#8208;like molecules. Cyclic voltammetry studies allow insight into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Highly Conjugated Bis(benzo[b]phosphole)&#8208;P&#8208;oxides: Synthesis and Electrochemical, Optical, and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of the two diastereoisomers cis&#8208;(E)&#8208;1 and trans&#8208;(E)&#8208;1 (the chiral and meso one respectively) containing two stereogenic P atoms has been accomplished in three different ways. This highly conjugated bis&#8208;(benzo[b]phosphole) P&#8208;oxide has been characterized by means of electrochemical and photophysical studies and the relative configuration of the two diastereoisomers assigned through CV and NMR studies.







Abstract
The first examples of a &#960;&#8208;conjugated benzo[b]phosphole P&#8208;oxide in which two phosphole P&#8208;oxide units are connected by a carbon&#8208;carbon double bond are described. The molecules are synthesized as E isomers with respect to the carbon&#8208;carbon double bond and exist as stable cis and trans isomers (chiral and meso one respectively) relatively to the two stereogenic P atoms. The optical and electrochemical properties of both isomers have been investigated by experiment and computations.

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;Arylpyrimido[4,5&#8208;b]porphyrins via Cyclization Reaction with Ammonia</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, a new series of &#946;,&#946;&#8217;&#8208;fused 2&#8208;arylpyrimido[4,5&#8208;b]porphyrins were synthesized through an ammonia assimilated condensation cyclization of 2&#8208;aroylamino&#8208;3&#8208;formylporphyrins in DMSO at 50&#8201;&#176;C. The preliminary photophysical studies revealed a significant bathochromic shift in electronic absorption and emission spectra of these porphyrinoids as compared to meso&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)porphyrins due to the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation.







Abstract
A facile synthetic strategy for the synthesis of a new series of &#946;,&#946;&#8217;&#8208;fused 2&#8208;arylpyrimido[4,5&#8208;b]porphyrins has been developed by using condensation cyclization reaction with ammonia. 2&#8208;Aroylamino&#8208;3&#8208;formylporphyrins were synthesized from 2&#8208;aroylaminoporphyrins under Vilsmeier&#8211;Haack reaction conditions, which were then efficiently converted to the corresponding 2&#8208;arylpyrimido[4,5&#8208;b]&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)&#8208;porphyrins via a condensation cyclization reaction. The nickel(II), copper(II), free&#8208;base and zinc(II) analogues of 2&#8208;arylpyrimido[4,5&#8208;b]porphyrins were successfully synthesized in 65&#8211;72&#8201;% yields and structurally characterized on the basis of spectral data analysis. On photophysical evaluation, 2&#8208;arylpyrimido[4,5&#8208;b]porphyrins demonstrated a 12&#8211;19&#8197;nm bathochromic shift in their electronic absorption spectra and up to 10&#8197;nm red shift in their emission spectra as compared to the simple meso&#8208;(tetrakis(4&#8208;chlorophenyl))porphyrins due to the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation.

         <title>A Fujiwara&#8211;Moritani&#8208;Type Alkenylation Using a Traceless Directing Group Strategy: A Rare Example of C&#8208;C Bond Formation towards the C2&#8208;Carbon of Terminal Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report, a rhodium catalyzed Fujiwara&#8208;Moritani&#8208;type reaction of unactivated terminal alkenes and benzoic acid derivatives bearing electron donating residues under mild conditions. The acid functionality acts as a traceless directing group delivering products alkenylated in meta&#8208;position to the electron donating substituent in contrast to the usually obtained ortho and para substitution in Friedel&#8208;Crafts type reactions. Remarkably, the new C&#8208;C bond is formed to the C2 of the terminal olefin, in contrast to similar reported transformations. Initially formed mixtures of exo&#8208; and endo&#8208;double bond isomers can be efficiently isomerized to the more stable endo&#8208;products.</dc:description>

         <title>Comparison of [18F]F&#8208;CNBI and [18F]F&#8208;CNPIFE as Positron Emission Tomography Probes for Noninvasive Imaging of Glycogen Synthase Kinase&#8208;3 in Normal Mice</title>

         <dc:description>
This study presents comparative uptake of two positron emission tomography (PET) probes [18F]F&#8208;CNBI and [18F]F&#8208;CNPIFE for imaging of the Glycogen Synthase Kinase&#8208;3&#945;/&#946; in normal FVB/NJ mouse brain. Developed PET probes showed nanomolar affinity towards GSK&#8208;3&#945;/&#946;. The PET probe [18F]F&#8208;CNPIFE showed order of magnitude higher brain uptake than [18F]F&#8208;CNBI in FVB/NJ mouse.







Abstract
Glycogen synthase kinase&#8208;3 &#945;/&#946; is involved in dysregulation of neuronal tau protein in Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is an unmet clinical need for a blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) permeable positron emission tomography (PET) probe for imaging of GSK&#8208;3&#945;/&#946; in the brain to understand the pathogenesis of AD. Herein, we synthesized two PET probes, [18F]F&#8208;CNBI and [18F]F&#8208;CNPIFE, and evaluated their BBB permeability and affinity towards GSK&#8208;3&#945;/&#946;. [19F]F&#8208;CNPIFE showed higher in&#8208;vitro binding towards GSK&#8208;3&#945;/&#946; (IC50=19.4&#177;2.5&#8197;nM; n=3, for GSK&#8208;3&#945;, IC50=19.4&#177;3.8&#8197;nM; n=3, for GSK&#8208;3&#946;) compared to [19F]F&#8208;CNBI (IC50=107.6&#177;26.0&#8197;nM; n=4, for GSK&#8208;3&#945;, IC50=105.3&#177;18.2&#8197;nM; n=3, for GSK&#8208;3&#946;). [18F]F&#8208;CNPIFE showed 9.5&#8208;fold higher brain uptake than [18F]F&#8208;CNBI, in normal FVB/NJ mice, which was increased by additional 1.5&#8208;fold on co&#8208;administration of [19F]F&#8208;CNPIFE with respect to [18F]F&#8208;CNBI. Overall, [18F]F&#8208;CNPIFE is a promising PET probe for GSK&#8208;3&#945;/&#946; imaging and warrants further evaluation in an AD mouse model.

The total synthesis of the 14&#8208;membered resorcylic acid lactone (&#8722;)&#8208;neocosmosin A is described. The key step in the synthesis is the palladium&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;arylation of TES&#8208;enol ethers of enones. The employment of the &#945;&#8208;arylation approach to this class of resorcylic acid lactones is a new approach, which has the scope of being generalized into a unified approach for the synthesis of this class of natural products.

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of enantiomeric &#947;&#8208;(acyloxy)carboxylic acids and &#947;&#8208;lactones from racemic &#947;&#8208;lactones is reported, which involves lipase&#8208;catalyzed acylation of &#947;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acid sodium salts in organic solvent followed by relactonization of the unreacted enantiomer. The products were separated by extraction, no column chromatography is needed.







Abstract
Scalable protocols of straightforward synthesis of enantiomeric &#947;&#8208;(acyloxy)carboxylic acids and &#947;&#8208;lactones are presented. The key step is lipase&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective acylation of &#947;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acid sodium salt in organic solvent followed by acidification of the product, extraction and acidic relactonization of the unreacted enantiomer. The mixture of &#947;&#8208;(acyloxy)carboxylic acid and &#947;&#8208;lactone is separated either by extraction with solution of sodium bicarbonate or by distillation. A switch of enantioinduction of Candida antarctica lipase B along homologous nucleophiles from R configuration of &#947;&#8208;hydroxyhexanoic acid salt to S configuration of the C7 and longer&#8208;chain homologues has been disclosed. Both enantiomers of &#947;&#8208;(acyloxy)pentanoic acids; &#947;&#8208;(acetyloxy)octanoic and &#8208;nonanoic acids with S configuration; [(1S,5R)&#8208;5&#8208;(chloroacetyloxy)cyclopent&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl]acetic acid and enantiomeric &#947;&#8208;lactones derived from them were prepared with e.&#8201;r. &gt;98.5/1.5. The rates of acylation of C5 to C9 homologous salts differ by three orders of magnitude but remain applicable for preparative synthesis by variation of the enzyme loading and reaction time.

         <title>Azulene&#8208;Indole Fused Polycyclic Heteroaromatics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Linear polycyclic systems are promising candidates in the area of organic electronics. Herein, we present the syntheses of three azulene&#8208;indole (AzIn) fused polycyclic heteroaromatics (PHAs), AzIn&#8208;1, AzIn&#8208;2 and DGAzIn, which have nitrogens and nonhexagonal rings simultaneously. The chemical structures, optical and electrochemical properties of three AzIn&#8208;based PHAs have been investigated, as well as their protonation behaviors with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). All three AzIn&#8208;based PHAs exhibit narrow optical band gaps with moderate to good air stability, anti&#8208;Kasha emission and reversible stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. Furthermore, these straightforward and simple synthetic routes would provide a new entry for constructing novel azulene&#8208;embedded &#960;&#8208;conjugates, especially for the seven&#8208;membered ring of azulene unit, wherein the regioselective transformation is not well developed.</dc:description>

         <title>Katritzky Salts for the Synthesis of Unnatural Amino Acids and Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of Peptides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous approved peptide drugs include unnatural amino acids (UAAs) in their sequences. Indeed, peptide drug discovery often benefits from the large structural diversity permitted by UAAs. Therefore, innovative chemical approaches either to synthesize UAAs or to allow late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides are emerging themes in peptide drug discovery. Thanks to the recent advances in deaminative strategies using alkylpyridiniums salts, often referred to as Katritzky salts, a variety of radical alkylation methods have been developed. In recent years the use of Katritzky salts have become popular in peptide chemistry due to their ease of preparation from a primary amine, which is a predominant functional group in amino acids. This review highlights the progress that has been made by using Katritzky salts in the synthesis of UAAs, late&#8208;stage peptide functionalization, and peptide macrocyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Natural Eutectic Solvent Mixture of L&#8208;Menthol/Malonic acid (4:1) and its Ibuprofen Solution: Thermal and Physical Characterizations and NMR Studies of Molecular Interaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A eutectic mixture of L&#8208;menthol and malonic acid, Me/MA (4:1), was characterized by calorimetry and other physical measurements. The new deep eutectic solvent (m.p. 6 &#176;C) solvates 338 mg of ibuprofen per mL, and the solution is stable in a wide temperature range. Strategies of NMR titration used in supramolecular chemistry were employed to explore binding forces between the eutectic constituents as well as solute&#8210;solvent interaction in ibuprofen solution. Even in acetonitrile, Me4MA is formed through a hydrogen&#8208;bonding network, where the constituents act as hydrogen donors and acceptors at the same time. The estimated association constant is around 30 M&#8722;1; the binding forces are enough to build the eutectic mixture at high concentrations. The aggregate Me4MA forms a molecular complex with ibuprofen in acetonitrile as a result of the cooperative effect of the constituents. In addition, van der Waals interactions are operative between ibuprofen and menthol in the saturated IB&#8210;Me/MA (4:1) solution.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A series of enantiomerically enriched 2&#8208;spirocyclopentyl&#8208;indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones were obtained through a phosphine&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition between aza&#8208;aurones and allenoates.







Abstract
An enantioselective phosphine&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition between aza&#8208;aurones and allenoates is here described. The reaction proceeded under mild reaction conditions to afford 2&#8208;spirocyclopentyl indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one derivatives as single &#947;&#8208;isomer and with high levels of stereocontrol.

         <title>Vanadium Catalyst for C&#8208; and S&#8208;Alkylation of Benzhydrols in Water: An Experimental Study and Green Metrics Evaluation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use strategy is reported that forms C&#8722;C and C&#8722;S bonds with a divanadium oxoperoxo catalyst. The reaction works well with various substrates in water under aerobic conditions.







Abstract
A strategy for the vanadium&#8208;catalyzed dehydrative C&#8208; and S&#8208;alkylation by nucleophilic substitution of benzhydrols with arenes and thiols is reported. The alkylation was achieved with the divanadium oxoperoxo complex [K3(V+5)2(O22&#8722;)4(O2&#8722;)2(&#956;&#8208;OH)] in water under air. The newly developed transformation could accommodate a broad substrate scope, including (hetero)arenes and thiols (34 examples). Both the symmetrical and unsymmetrical benzhydrols furnished excellent yields of the alkylated product under mild reaction conditions. The scope of this strategy was further extended to synthesize bis&#8208;benzylated arenes (poly&#8208;arylated products) in high yields and regioselectivities. The green metrics determination of all the alkylated products suggests the technical and environmental benefits of the present protocol. The longevity experiment reveals the catalytic activity was maintained over seven cycles. To understand the mechanism of the present reaction, spectroscopic and kinetic studies were undertaken. This simple protocol, which affords the desired products with water as the by&#8208;product, can be achieved under mild conditions without needing a base or other additives.

An efficient method was developed to construct 2&#8208;pyridinones by the cycloaddition of nitro ketene aminal with 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;aryl&#8208;acrylate. The method uses readily&#8208;available starting materials and provided diverse bicyclic 2&#8208;pyridinones and multi&#8208;substituted 6&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinones in good to excellent yields.







Abstract
An efficient and simple procedure for the preparation of 2&#8208;pyridinone is reported. The obtained products contained various bicyclic 2&#8208;pyridinones and multi&#8208;substituted 6&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinones. This approach employed 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;aryl acrylate and nitro ketene aminal as substrates, and the corresponding 2&#8208;pyridinones were obtained in good to excellent yields. This method may be used for the synthesis of bicyclic 2&#8208;pyridinones, as well as multi&#8208;substituted complex 2&#8208;pyridinones.

         <title>Mechanistic Studies on the Bidentate Lewis Acid Catalyzed Domino Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8208;Alder/Thiol Transfer Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective multicomponent reaction (MCR) of phthalazines, aldehydes and thiophenols provides access to thioether&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes. To illuminate its mechanism, control experiments, NMR studies and DFT computations were conducted. In particular the arrangement of the diene and dienophile in the IEDDA step was investigated, as it determines the enantioselectivity of this method.







Abstract
Recently, we presented a novel enantioselective multicomponent reaction of phthalazines, aldehydes and thiols accessing thioether&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes. Herein, a comprehensive investigation on the mechanism of this domino inverse electron&#8208;demand (IEDDA)/thiol transfer reaction is disclosed. In particular, the origin of the stereochemical outcome has been rationalized, as well as structural requirement of the thiol component for an efficient transfer step. Detailed NMR spectroscopy studies uncover a competing reaction pathway resulting in N,S&#8208;acetals. In addition, DFT computations illuminate the mechanism of the group transfer process and enable an explanation for the formation of the most dominant by&#8208;product. The insights allow a direct prediction of suitable substrates for the reaction and provide the basis for further developments of novel stereoselective domino reactions.

         <dc:description>The ring&#8208;opening reaction of nitro&#8208;substituted donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes with pyrazoles in DMSO was investigated. Unexpectedly, the cyclopropanes underwent Kornblum&#8208;type ring&#8208;opening oxidation with DMSO to form aroylmethylidene malonates as intermediates in the reactions. The intermediates further underwent aza&#8208;Michael addition with pyrazoles in tandem manner to give the corresponding aza&#8208;Michael adducts. The highlights of the methodology include the occurrence of ring&#8208;opening/oxidation under neutral conditions with DMSO and formation of aza&#8208;Michael adducts with pyrazoles under catalyst&#8208;free conditions.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the search for improved photochromic systems that may be used for the efficient reversible conversion of light into chemical energy, eight mono&#173;aryl&#8208;sub&#173;stituted norbornadienes are presented, which carry naphthyl, an&#173;thra&#173;cenyl, or donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;phenyl substituents to establish an extended &#960; system. The substrates were synthesized by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reactions, and their absorption properties, the key para&#173;meters of the photochromic equilibrium, and the energy storage density of the quadricyclane products were examined. It was observed that these compounds have favorable properties for chemical energy storage. Specifically, 1&#8208;(2&#8208;naphthyl)&#173;nor&#173;bor&#173;nadiene showed a pronounced red shift of the absorption, a long half&#8208;life (35 d) and a relatively high energy storage density (361&#160;KJ/Kg) of the respective quadricyclane. Therefore, the so far neglected mono&#173;aryl&#8208;&#173;nor&#173;bor&#173;na&#173;dienes represent a useful and complementary class of compounds that should be considered in the development of efficient molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST) compounds, which can reversibly convert sunlight into chemical energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of [60]Fullerene Hybrids Endowed with Steroids and Monosaccharides: Theoretical Underpinning as Promising anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Agents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopropanation reactions between C60 and different malonates decorated with monosaccharides and steroids using the Bingel&#8208;Hirsch methodology have allowed the obtention of a new family of hybrid compounds in good yields. A complete set of instrumental techniques has let to fully characterize the hybrid derivatives and to determine the chemical structure of monocycloadducts. Besides, the proposed structures were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, which evidenced the exclusive reductive pattern of fullerene Bingel&#8208;type monoadducts. Theoretical calculations at the DFT&#8208;D3(BJ)/PBE 6311G(d,p) level of the synthesized conjugates predict the most stable conformation and determine the factors that control the hybrid molecules' geometry. Some parameters such as polarity, lipophilicity, polar surface area, hydrophilicity index, and solvent&#8208;accessible surface area were also estimated, predicting its potential permeability and capability as cell membrane penetrators. Additionally, a molecular docking simulation has been carried out using the main protease of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (Mpro) as the receptor, thus paving the way to study the potential application of these hybrids in biomedicine.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A photochemical method based on visible&#8208;light (white LEDs/sunlight) irradiation has been developed for the regioselective and oxidative C(sp2)&#8722;H selenylation and sulfenylation of substituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,4&#8208;naphthoquinones.







Abstract
A photochemical method based on visible&#8208;light (white LEDs/sunlight) irradiation has been developed for the regioselective and oxidative C(sp2)&#8722;H selenylation and sulfenylation of substituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,4&#8208;naphthoquinones under oxygen atmosphere. The photochemical process does not require any external photoredox catalysts. The other notable advantages of this protocol are metal&#8208;free synthesis, visible light/sunlight as energy sources, good substrate scope, and moderate to good yields (41&#8211;91&#8201;%) with high regioselectivity.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Photocatalysis for the Direct C&#8208;H Trifluoromethylation of Heterocycles with an Organic Photoredox Catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous&#8208;flow photocatalytic direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of heterocycles has been successfully developed, enabling the construction of diverse trifluoromethylated heterocycles efficiently and rapidly.







Abstract
Photocatalysis for direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation represents an ideal way to synthesize trifluoromethyl&#8208;containing chemical compounds, but the conventional batch processes are inefficient with limited light penetration and indispensably irradiated for a long while. Herein, we report a continuous&#8208;flow protocol for photocatalytic direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of heterocycles in the presence of an organic photoredox catalyst: 2,4,6&#8208;tris(diphenylamino)&#8208;3,5&#8208;difluorobenzonitrile (3DPA2FBN). In this approach, benefiting from the merger of organic photoredox catalysis and continuous&#8208;flow techniques, a variety of trifluoromethylated heterocycles were rapidly synthesized up to 85&#8201;% yield with 80&#8197;min residence time under metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free reaction conditions.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;induced three&#8208;component coupling reaction of quinoxalinones with unactivated alkenes and ABX was developed, providing access to a variety of bioactive organoazides with quinoxalinone scaffold in good yields and excellent regioselectivities.







Abstract
A photo&#8208;induced three&#8208;component coupling reaction of quinoxalinones with unactivated alkenes and azidobenziodoxolone (ABX, Zhdankin reagent) was developed. The protocol provides an efficient approach for the synthesis of various bioactive organoazides with quinoxalinone scaffold in moderate to good yields under mild conditions. This reaction is environmentally friendly avoiding the use of expensive transition&#8208;metal photocatalysts and stoichiometric oxidants.

         <dc:description>
A novel total synthesis of licochalcone C on an up to 30&#8197;g scale was disclosed that relied on the directed ortho&#8208;metalation of bis&#8208;O&#8208;MOM&#8208;protected resorcinol for the regioselective C&#8208;prenylation, followed by metalation&#8208;formylation, selective O&#8208;deprotection &#8211; methylation, and aldol reaction with p&#8208;hydroxyacetophenone. The synthesis of related licoagrochalcones B, C, and D was also performed.







Abstract
A novel efficient method for the synthesis of licochalcone C in good yield on up to 30&#8197;g scale was developed. The reaction sequence included relied on the directed ortho&#8208;metalation (DOM) of bis&#8208;O&#8208;MOM&#8208;protected resorcinol for the regioselective C&#8208;prenylation, followed by metalation&#8208;formylation, selective O&#8208;deprotection of a hydroxyl group located between the formyl and prenyl groups, its methylation, and aldol reaction with p&#8208;hydroxyacetophenone.

     alt="Regioselective and Scalable Total Synthesis of Licochalcone C and Related Licoagrochalcones"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel total synthesis of licochalcone C on an up to 30&#8197;g scale was disclosed that relied on the directed &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-metalation of bis-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-MOM-protected resorcinol for the regioselective &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-prenylation, followed by metalation-formylation, selective &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-deprotection &#8211; methylation, and aldol reaction with &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxyacetophenone. The synthesis of related licoagrochalcones B, C, and D was also performed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel efficient method for the synthesis of licochalcone C in good yield on up to 30&#8197;g scale was developed. The reaction sequence included relied on the directed &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-metalation (DOM) of bis-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-MOM-protected resorcinol for the regioselective &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-prenylation, followed by metalation-formylation, selective &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-deprotection of a hydroxyl group located between the formyl and prenyl groups, its methylation, and aldol reaction with &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxyacetophenone. Synthesis of structurally related retrochalcones, i.e., licoagrochalcones B, C, and D, was also proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Origins of the Reactivity in 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions of Acyl Isocyanide Ylides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A toolbox of quantum chemical&#8208;based methods is used to elucidate the reactivity of acyl&#8208;isocyanide ylides in 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions. The theoretical analysis reveals two general modes of action depending on the electronic properties of the dipolarophile.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Dipolar cycloadditions are the preferred method to generate five&#8208;membered heterocyclic rings. Surprisingly, cycloadditions based on acyl&#8208;isocyanide ylides have remained underexplored by the chemical community. Acyl&#8208;isocyanide ylides readily react with dipolarophiles, such as substituted alkenes, to yield &#916;1&#8208;pyrroline derivatives. As an explanation for the observed reactivity of this reaction is lacking, extensive density functional theory calculations were performed to scrutinize the mechanistic features of the transformation. Herein we explain the experimental outcome of the reaction using a variety of reactivity theories and predict opposed regioselectivity for electron&#8208;poor and electron&#8208;rich dipolarophiles. With the insights obtained, we hope to incentivize the design of new cycloaddition reactions based on the acyl&#8208;isocyanide ylides motif.

         <title>Oxidative Coupling of 4&#8208;Hydroxycoumarins with Quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones Induced by Visible Light under Aerobic Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct and selective C(sp2)&#8208;H/C(sp2)&#8208;H cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling has become a promising strategy to increase molecular complexity with a high atom economy. This study describes an efficient and straightforward protocol for the regioselective C3&#8208;H/C3&#8208;H cross&#8208;coupling of 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarin derivatives with quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones, including late&#8208;stage modification of natural drugs, promoted by visible light under aerobic conditions at room temperature. With this approach, a wide range of hybrid drug&#8208;like molecules were prepared, using air as the terminal oxidant. Remarkably, the C4 OH group at the coumarin ring is essential for the reaction and has been used as a handle for diverse functionalizations of the final products. Moreover, sunlight can promote the reaction under very mild and sustainable conditions, even on a gram scale. Qualitative and semi&#8208;quantitative tools were used to demonstrate the greenness advance of this methodology over previously reported ones. Several experiments were conducted to propose a plausible mechanism for this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Aculenes B and D</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first total synthesis of aculene D, a structurally rare nordaucane&#8208;type natural product exhibiting quorum sensing inhibitory activity, has been accomplished from a known five&#8208;membered hydroxy carboxylic acid. Nucleophilic addition of methallylzinc bromide to a &#946;&#8208;keto aldehyde intermediate under Barbier conditions to install the secondary hydroxy group on the seven&#8208;membered ring of aculene D gave the corresponding alcohol with an undesired configuration predominantly. On the other hand, the protection of its keto group as the ethylene acetal induced a reversal of diastereoselectivity, affording a desired diastereomer in a selective manner. The construction of the seven&#8208;membered ring was realized by ring&#8208;closing metathesis using a triethylsilyl&#8208;protected monocyclic diene ester precursor. An additional five&#8208;step manipulation on the cyclization product including the installation of an ethyl group on the five&#8208;membered ring completed the synthesis of aculene D, whose esterification with an N&#8208;protected L&#8208;proline followed by deprotection also achieved the first total synthesis of aculene B.</dc:description>

The heterogenized copper(I) complex can be facilely prepared from inexpensive reagents via a simple procedure and exhibits a remarkably higher catalytic activity than CuI, and can be recycled more than ten times without a significant drop in its catalytic efficiency.

         <dc:description>
A useful protocol to synthesize 1,3&#8208;dioxan&#8208;2&#8208;ones from homoallylic carbonates by photo&#8208;aerobic selenium&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acid multicatalysis is reported. Previous methods predominantly relied on stoichiometric additions of electrophiles onto alkenes or the presence of nucleofuges in allylic position of the olefin. In contrast, the C&#8722;C double bond can also be directly activated by the catalytic interplay of a pyrylium dye and a diselane.







Abstract
An expedient method for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from homoallylic carbonic acid esters by means of photo&#8208;aerobic selenium&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acid multicatalysis is reported. Until now, conceptually related methods commonly relied either on the stoichiometric addition of electrophiles onto the substrate's alkene moiety or the presence of pre&#8208;installed leaving groups in allylic position of said alkene to &#8211; in part, catalytically &#8211; initiate an intramolecular attack by an adjacent carbonic acid ester group. In sharp contrast, the current study shows that the C&#8722;C double bond of homoallylic carbonic acid esters can be directly activated by the catalytic interplay of a pyrylium dye and a diselane using ambient air as the sole oxidant and visible light as an energy source.

In sharp contrast, the current study shows that the C&#8722;C double bond of homoallylic carbonic acid esters can be directly activated by the catalytic interplay of a pyrylium dye and a diselane using ambient air as the sole oxidant and visible light as an energy source.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multicomponent Synthesis of Purines and Pyrimidines: From the Origin of Life to New Sustainable Approaches for Drug&#8208;Discovery Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Purines and pyrimidines are two of the most important heterocycles in nature and this Reviews summarizes the milestone multicomponent reaction based approaches that have been developed over the years for their sustainable production.







Abstract
It is widely accepted that purines and pyrimidines, the building blocks that gave origin to life on our planet, were created through multicomponent reactions (MCRs) on early abiotic Earth. These heterocyclic scaffolds gradually evolved into a wide range of biologically relevant molecules regulating many different physiological processes and thus becoming widely exploited as templates for the development of new drugs. Accordingly, over the years, the synthetic community has dedicated many efforts in the attempt to hypothesize and replicate the original abiotic synthesis of purines and pyrimidines, thus developing a number of multicomponent synthesis to access these scaffolds. The following evolution of synthetic chemistry towards green approaches for the production of new molecules and the recent interest in pharmaceutical sustainability underlines the importance of multicomponent synthesis of new heterocycles. This review article provides an overview of the most important multicomponent approaches for the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine derivatives for potential pharmacological applications.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Enamides through Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Amidation of Conjugated Olefins with 2&#8208;Pyridones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative amidation of conjugated olefin with 2&#8208;pyridone is developed. A series of E&#8208;Enamides were synthesized with high stereoselectivities. Other cyclic and acyclic amides are also tolerated in this catalytic system.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative amidation of conjugated olefin with 2&#8208;pyridone is described. A series of E&#8208;Enamides were synthesized in a highly stereocontrolled manner. The reaction also accommodates other cyclic and acyclic amides. Z&#8208;Enamides were predominantly prepared for primary amides probably due to the presence of an intramolecular hydrogen bond. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis of enamide and the following oxidative annulation with diphenylacetylene demonstrates the synthetic utility of this reaction.

         <dc:description>
Herein, an electrochemical oxidative multicomponent thiocyanation by using ammonium thiocyanate as thiocyano source was described in an undivided cell under mild conditions. A broad spectrum of 4&#8208;thiocyanato&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazoles were synthesized through the functionalization of the pyrazole intermediates.







Abstract
An electrochemical oxidative three&#8208;component tandem reaction of arylhydrazines, 1,3&#8208;diketones and ammonium thiocyanate has been established to construct 4&#8208;thiocyanato&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazoles under metal&#8208;, oxidant&#8208;free and mild conditions in an undivided cell. Various 4&#8208;thiocyanato&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazole derivatives could be obtained with broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance from available raw materials in moderate to excellent yields. This thiocyanation protocol with practicability and scalability features economical and eco&#8208;friendly.

         <title>Mechanochemical Radical Boronation of Aryl Diazonium Salts Promoted by Sodium Chloride</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arylboronates are helpful building blocks in organic synthesis. Here, we present an efficient mechanochemical synthesis of arylboronates from arene diazonium salts. Importantly, this transformation was significantly enhanced by sodium chloride, which probably promotes the decomposition of diazonium salts via anion exchange. Chloride anions also participate in the formation of strongly reducing Cl&#8208;B anion radical intermediate that promotes radical chain reaction. The reaction proceeds more efficiently with a small amount of polar solvent as a liquid&#8208;assisted grinding additive. Quantum chemical calculations support the mechanistic proposal.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Mediated Sulfur Extrusion of Disulfides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sulfur extrusion from organic disulfides is a highly useful reaction recognised for the first time over 40 years ago. Unfortunately, it is mainly performed by aminophosphines, such as hexamethylphosphorus triamide, which is known to be very carcinogenic. This is limiting the application of the extrusion reaction especially for the synthesis of pharmaceutical products. We have developed a new method, using N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), generated from the corresponding stable imidazolium salts in combination with a base to transform a broad scope of benzylic disulfides to thioethers. In addition disulfide containing esters as well as cystine undergo this reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Catellani Reaction with 1,1&#8208;Bis[(pinacolato)boryl]methane as the Nucleophilic Component</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first use of 1,1&#8208;bis[(pinacolato)boryl]methane as the terminating reagent in Catellani reaction is reported. The reaction provides an efficient method to access benzylboronates, which are useful organoboron compounds in organic synthesis.







Abstract
We report herein the application of 1,1&#8208;bis[(pinacolato)boryl]methane as a new type of terminating reagent to realize three&#8208;component coupling reaction with aryl iodide and different electrophiles. A series of ortho&#8208;disubstituted benzylboronates can be synthesized and the ortho&#8208;substituent can be varied by using bromoacetic esters or O&#8208;benzoyl hydroxylamine as electrophiles with slightly modified reaction conditions. The reaction shows good functional group tolerance and the obtained benzyl boronate products can be easily transformed to various synthetically useful compounds.

         <dc:description>We describe an efficient method for &#945;&#8208;functionalization of N&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinolines under visible&#8208;light&#8208;irradiation catalyzed by organic photocatalyst. This protocol provides a concise and environmental approach for the rapid allylation and benzylation of N&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinolines, and shows broad substrate scope. Stable organoboron reagents have shown their ability in the construction of challenging Csp3&#8211;Csp3 bond. The load of the photocatalyst is low and the oxidant is inexpensive and less toxic.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The cyanide&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;transformation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoesters to &#948;&#8208;lactones with exocyclic ester moiety is the key transformation for the preparation of racemic 5&#8208;hexadecanolide (15% over nine steps) and 6&#8208;acetoxy&#8208;5&#8208;hexadecanolide (22% over eight steps), two insect pheromones. The benzyloxycarbonyl moiety is transformed via the acid chloride to the undecanoyl side chain. After reduction of the ketone to the secondary alcohol, this functional group was either reduced via the chloro compound to furnish the 5&#8208;hexadecanolide. On the other hand, stereoselective reduction of the ketone gave secondary alcohol with the wrong relative configuration, which was established by X&#8208;ray single crystal structure. Inversion was achieved by reaction of the methansulfonate with cesium acetate yielding (R*,S*)&#8208;6&#8208;acetoxy&#8208;5&#8208;hexadecanolide with the relative configuration also present in the natural product.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Synthesis of Pulvinic Acids Including Xerocomic Acid and Fluorescence Properties of Bis&#8208;lactone Intermediates.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of representative pulvinic acids were synthesised using a bioinspired strategy. Terphenyl&#8208;quinones (polyporic acid scaffold) were prepared via sequential Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings allowing access to unsymmetrically substituted derivatives in a one&#8208;pot protocol. Subjected to the action of acetic anhydride and DMSO, quinones were converted into bis&#8208;lactone intermediates. Methanolysis and deprotection achieved the total syntheses of the corresponding pulvinic acids. Following this general strategy, symmetrical pulvinic, atromentic, variegatic acids and unsymmetrical congeners pinastric, iso&#8208;pinastric, xerocomic and iso&#8208;xerocomic acids were prepared in fair yields. Fluorescence properties were observed for the bis&#8208;lactone intermediates and, as a complement to this synthetic work, optical properties were measured, and fluorescence quantum yields were determined for the bis&#8208;lactone pigments.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantifying Vertical Resonance Energy in Aromatic Systems with Natural Bond Orbitals</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural bond orbitals (NBOs) provide the familiar Lewis type (2c&#8208;2e  &#8208;  ) localized description of a molecule. Interactions between nearly filled (2e  &#8208;  ) orbitals and empty (&#960;* or &#963;*) anti&#8208;bonding orbitals represent delocalization in the system and creates a framework to study stereoelectronic interactions. Here we show that  deleting  the interactions (NBODel) between &#960; and &#960;* orbitals in aromatic systems and acquiring the energy with the NBO program provides a highly intuitive and quantitative picture of &#960;&#8208;aromaticity that correlates with the well&#8208;established nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift (NICS) method. This natural bond orbital resonance energy (NBO&#8208;RE) measures the vertical resonance energy (VRE) of aromatic systems without the use of an external reference structure. The NBO&#8208;RE method is applicable to the study of local aromaticity in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other non&#8208;planar systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Cooperatively Catalyzed Heteroarylation of Aryl Fluorosulfonates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a bimetallic cooperatively catalyzed C&#8208;H activation strategy for the heteroarylation of easily accessed aryl fluorosulfonates which were introduced to sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) click chemistry by Sharpless. This novel catalytic system enables highly chemoselective synthesis of important heterobiaryl motifs through the coupling of aryl fluorosulfonates in the absence of prefunclization and directing groups. Moreover, this strategy has good functional group tolerance and a wide range of substrates and could be successfully used for the synthesis of bioactive molecules tafamidis.</dc:description>

         <title>Lithiation&#8208;Functionalisation of Triazoles Bearing Electron&#8208;Withdrawing N&#8208;Substituents: Challenges and Solutions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regioselective lithiation of 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles provides an opportunity to introduce additional functionality, however this simple functionalisation strategy using triazoles bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing N&#8208;substituents has not been investigated until now. Herein, we demonstrate that the lithiated triazole intermediates can readily decompose, even at &#8722;78 &#176;C. In addition, lithiation&#8208;deuteration studies reveal lithiation can take place competitively on both the triazole and the electron&#8208;withdrawn aryl ring. Careful control of reaction conditions is therefore required to i) minimise decomposition pathways; and ii) facilitate regioselective functionalisation of the triazole.</dc:description>

         <title>Organophosphites: An Addition to the Arsenal of Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organophosphites are nucleophilic in nature and can act as a good leaving group owing to the stability of the phosphite anion. This dual reactivity makes them good candidates for nucleophilic organocatalysis. However, phosphites were introduced only in 2004 as the umpolung catalyst for acylsilane substrates utilizing sequential Brook rearrangements. Very recently, phosphites have been reported to catalyze aza&#8208;rearrangements and radical reactions. Here, we discuss the reactivity parameters to understand its lack of use, as well as the potential for catalysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene palladium (NHC&#8208;palladium) catalyzed cascade annulation of alkynoic acids with unactivated alkenes under an oxygen atmosphere in ionic liquid is described. This protocol enables facile access for the preparation of diverse alkyl substituted &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactones in moderate to good yields with excellent Z/E selectivity. Moreover, ionic liquid not only acts as the green solvent, but also acts as the eco&#8208;friendly chlorine source, thus avoiding the use of excess metal halides such as cupric chloride. Some preliminary mechanistic studies were performed, further revealed this cascade annulation possible pathways.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Thiourea&#8208; and squaramide&#8208;based bifunctional base catalysts represent nowadays a powerful tool in the field of asymmetric catalysis and have demonstrated very efficient for promoting a wide variety of transformations enantioselectively. New versions that incorporate one or various additional H&#8208;bond donor site(s) in the catalyst structure have been developed recently which led to more active (reduced catalyst loadings) and selective catalysts. This review highlights the pioneering ideas and the most recent contributions to the area with the material organized according to the nature of the additional H&#8208;bond donor functionality. The advantages, current limitations and perspectives of these new multifunctional catalysts are discused.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Flavin&#8208;Indole&#8208;Conjugates with Rigid Diamino Linkers as Cryptochrome Model Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of flavin&#8208;indole conjugates with a trans&#8208;1,4&#8208;diaminocyclohexane and a 2,6&#8208;diaminodecahydronaphthalene linker is reported. Both compounds should serve as artificial model compounds for natural cryptochrome. It is assumed that cryptochrome photoreceptor proteins located in the retina show a light&#8208;dependent quantum effect which enables migratory birds to perceive the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field and is thus used for navigation. Both model compounds were prepared by stepwise reductive aminations of indole carbaldehyde and a flavin&#8208;substituted acetaldehyde with the appropriate diamine linkers. The hitherto unknown 2,6&#8208;diamino&#8208; decahydronaphthalene was prepared in four steps from 2,6&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene as the achiral (meso) ax,ax&#8208;trans&#8208;diastereoisomer. The configuration of this key intermediate as well as synthetic precursors has been established by a series of X&#8208;ray single crystal analyses.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;&#960; Interaction for Molecular Recognition of Anions: Focus on Cooperativity with Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen bonding and anion&#8208;&#960; interactions: two interactions of today's research in anion recognition supramolecular chemistry. The combination of these two interactions gives rise to interesting cooperativity effects that remain difficult to rationalize and quantify. In this Review, concepts of cooperativity are illustrated by reporting examples of combination of hydrogen bonding and anion&#8208;&#960; interaction.







Abstract
Anion recognition represents an active area of research in supramolecular chemistry. The last two decades have been marked by spectacular advances in the design of new anion receptors. Moreover, the development of approaches combining experimental and theoretical studies has proved to be particularly relevant, allowing for a better understanding and rationalization of the phenomena involved in anion complexation processes. In this context, the combination of weak interactions within the same receptor and their synergistic effects, called cooperativity, has attracted increasing interest within the scientific community. This Review focuses on the combination of anion&#8208;&#960; and hydrogen bonds and the emerging concept of cooperativity. The most relevant anion&#8208;&#960; donor families are presented. The concept of cooperativity is illustrated using the most recent examples present in current literature.

         <title>Three Complementary One&#8208;Pot Four&#8208;Component Reaction Sequences for Rapid, General and Direct Spiropyran Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three distinct one&#8208;pot three&#8208;step four&#8208;component processes for spiropyran synthesis were developed. These complementary reaction sequences enable efficient and straightforward synthesis of structurally diverse spiropyrans from simple and readily available precursors.







Abstract
Three one&#8208;pot three&#8208;step four&#8208;component reaction sequences for spiropyran synthesis have been developed, based around three different methods for in situ generation of 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted indoles (indole N&#8208;alkylation, Fischer indolisation and indole C&#8208;alkylation). The reaction sequences give access to a broad swathe of spiropyran structures. Each sequence is operationally straightforward, rapid and high yielding. We have synthesized 58 structurally diverse spiropyrans bearing a wide range of useful functional groups, and their utility were demonstrated in the targeted synthesis of potential ratiometric fluorescence probes for metal ions and spiropyran&#8208;cholesterol conjugates. Finally, we showed that our one&#8208;pot N&#8208;alkylation&#8208;C&#8208;alkylation&#8208;condensation sequence can underpin combinatorial spiropyran synthesis through generation of a 16&#8208;member spiropyran library.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Chemistry for Synthesis and Co&#8208;conformational Control of Mechanically Interlocked Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient synthesis of mechanical bonds is a huge challenge. Dynamic covalent chemistry is one of the most efficient methods for forming rotaxanes, catenanes and molecular knots in high yields. This Review reports recent uses of reversible covalent bonds to synthesize mechanically interlocked molecules, and discusses how dynamic bonds can be used to control motion in interlocked molecular machinery.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules have found extensive applications in areas all across the physical sciences, from materials to catalysis and sensing. However, introducing mechanical bonds and entanglements at the molecular level is still a significant challenge due to the inherent restriction in entropy needed to preorganize strands before interlocking. Over the last decade, dynamic covalent chemistry has emerged as one of the most efficient methods of forming rotaxanes, catenanes and molecular knots. By using reversible bonds such as imines, disulfides and boronate esters, one can use the inherent error&#8208;correction in these linkages to form interlocked architectures with high fidelity and often in excellent yields. This review reports on recent advances in the use of dynamic covalent chemistry to make mechanically interlocked molecules, systematically surveying clipping, capping and templating approaches with dynamic bonds. Furthermore, it is also discussed how dynamic bonds can be used to control motion, co&#8208;conformational expression and catalytic activity in mechanically interlocked molecular machinery.

         <title>Amphiphilic Iminosugar Pharmacological Chaperones towards &#946;&#8208;Glucocerebrosidase: Self&#8208;Assembly and Biological Activity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pharmacological chaperones (PCs) are new therapeutics for protein misfolding diseases, and amphiphilic PCs perform best in Gaucher Disease patients&#8217; cell lines. With the aim of investigating the biological activity vs aggregation behaviour of a new N&#8208;alkylated iminosugar&#8208;based PC, a complete physicochemical study in solution and in the solid state was performed, which ruled out a self&#8208;assembly based multivalent effect.







Abstract
Pharmacological chaperones (PCs) can restore correct enzymatic activity at sub&#8208;inhibitory concentrations and are considered an emerging therapy for Gaucher Disease (GD). Amphiphilic PCs show more favourable cross&#8208;membrane properties and have a higher activity on cells than hydrophilic PCs. To investigate whether the biological activity of amphiphilic iminosugars is related to their state as monomers or as micellar aggregates, we synthesized some novel N&#8208;alkylated iminosugars and performed physico&#8208;chemical characterizations in the solid state and in aqueous dispersion of the best compound in terms of biological activity. The results suggest that the C12 N&#8208;alkylated iminosugar 10 exerts its biological activity in the monomeric state, and that the low cell viability observed in the presence of a 50&#8197;&#956;M concentration of compound 10 is not related to the formation of micellar aggregates in solution.

         <title>Flexibility versus Rigidity: How Conformational Constraint, Steric Hinderance and Solvent Impact Binding Between &#960;&#8208;electron Poor Tweezer&#8208;Type Hosts and &#960;&#8208;Electron Rich Guests.</title>

         <dc:description>Tweezer&#8208;type receptors that form p&#8208;p stacked supramolecular complexes are important components in functional polymers and molecular machines. Herein, we study how varying specific structural components of tweezer&#8208;receptors impacts their binding. A library of tweezer receptors, each containing two p&#8208;electron poor receptor residues and differing by the nature of the linking unit which was either a flexible 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylamine) residue or a rigid&#160;3,3&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;diamino&#8208;m&#8208;terphenyl diamine structure, were synthesised. Each tweezer formed 1:1 supramolecular complexes with p&#8208;electron rich residues (1,5&#8208;dihydroxynapthalene and pyrene) as confirmed by UV/Vis and&#160;1H NMR spectroscopic studies. Binding constants were determined to be between 2.3x10&#8208;5&#160;and 71 M&#8208;1&#160;in organic solvents and were one magnitude greater in aqueous solvents for water soluble systems. The nature of the linker had variable effects on the binding constants, showing the design of tweezer type supramolecular receptors with targeted&#160;Ka&#160;values is non&#8208;trivial and requires structural optimisation supported by binding constant determination studies.</dc:description>

A library of tweezer receptors, each containing two p-electron poor receptor residues and differing by the nature of the linking unit which was either a flexible 2,2&#8242;-(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylamine) residue or a rigid&#160;3,3&#8217;&#8217;-diamino-m-terphenyl diamine structure, were synthesised. Each tweezer formed 1:1 supramolecular complexes with p-electron rich residues (1,5-dihydroxynapthalene and pyrene) as confirmed by UV/Vis and&#160;1H NMR spectroscopic studies. Binding constants were determined to be between 2.3x10-5&#160;and 71 M-1&#160;in organic solvents and were one magnitude greater in aqueous solvents for water soluble systems. The nature of the linker had variable effects on the binding constants, showing the design of tweezer type supramolecular receptors with targeted&#160;Ka&#160;values is non-trivial and requires structural optimisation supported by binding constant determination studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Homocoupling of 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;N&#8208;heterocycles and Application to the Synthesis of Phenylpyridine Borane Dimers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a regioselective cross&#8208;dehydrogenative homocoupling reaction using a heterogeneous Ru catalyst and iron trichloride as oxidant to gain access to various 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic dimers. Several homocoupling products obtained were then used to synthesize a series of pyridine&#8208;borane complexes and the impact of the dimerization on their photophysical properties was studied and rationalized by using theoretical calculations.







Abstract
A method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic dimers via a cross&#8208;dehydrogenative homocoupling (homo&#8208;CDC) has been developed using commercially available Ruthenium on charcoal as catalyst and iron trichloride as oxidant. A large variety of heterocyclic scaffolds and functional groups are tolerated and a complete regioselectivity resulting from the activation of the less sterically hindered C&#8722;H bonds was observed for meta&#8208;substituted substrates. Starting from several homocoupling products obtained, a series of pyridine&#8208;borane complexes was synthesized and the impact of the dimerization on their photophysical properties was studied and rationalized using theoretical calculations.

         <title>Deoxygenative Intramolecular Minisci&#8208;Type Reaction to Access Fused Heterocyclic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid build of molecular complexity is a key for the development of novel bioactive molecules. Herein we present a three&#8208;step synthetic sequence to access fused heterocyclic scaffolds from readily available starting materials, such as halogenated heteroarenes and 1,3&#8208;diols. The key step of the strategy is the development of a deoxygenative intramolecular Minisci&#8208;type reaction.







Abstract
Herein, we present a straightforward strategy for the synthesis of fused heterocycles through a deoxygenative, intramolecular Minisci&#8208;type reaction. This approach grants access to complex polycyclic scaffolds in three steps from readily available starting materials, such as chlorinated heteroarenes and 1,3&#8208;diols. The use of saccharide derivatives as the starting 1,3&#8208;diol motif allows for the synthesis of novel heterocyclic scaffolds with excellent diastereoselectivity and formal retention of configuration at the newly formed C&#8722;C bond.

         <title>In Situ Generated DBU&#8901;HF Acts as a Fluorinating Agent in a Hexafluoroisobutylation Tandem Reaction: An Effective Route to 5,5,5,5&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;Hexafluoroleucine</title>

A stereoselective synthesis of both (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;5,5,5,5&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;hexafluoroleucine mediated by DBU through a cascade reaction is reported. The pivotal role of the organic base to preserve the nucleophilicity of the fluoride released during the process is shown. The direct incorporation of the hexafluorinated side chain allows for the facile preparation of the free and suitably protected fluorinated amino acids on a multidecagram scale.







Abstract
We report the direct incorporation of the hexafluoroisobutyl group on a chiral glycine Schiff base complex mediated by 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene (DBU). The fluoroalkylation involves 2&#8208;(bromomethyl)&#8208;1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoropropane reagent, which generates in&#8197;situ hexafluoroisobutylene (HFIB), and reacts then with the enolate through a tandem allylic shift/hydrofluorination process. We showed that the use of neutral organic base DBU generates in&#8197;situ an original DBU&#8901;HF salt, which preserves the fluoride nucleophilicity and acts as a fluorinating agent. This fluoride salt promotes the hydrofluorination of the pentafluorinated alkene overcoming the usual fluoride &#946;&#8208;elimination observed with &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;vinyl reagents. With alkali metal bases, by contrast, the hydrofluorination is disfavored and the pentafluorinated alkene intermediate is obtained predominantly. This study highlights the critical role of the fluoride counter ion to preserve its nucleophilicity. The protocol is amenable to multidecagram scale synthesis of enantiopure (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;5,5,5,5&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;hexafluoroleucine and their N&#8208;Fmoc or N&#8208;Boc derivatives in good overall yield.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Catalyst&#8208;Free Access to Phthalazines: Entry to Antiviral Model Drugs by Merging Domino Reactions

Light as air: A straightforward metal&#8208;free four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy to access new high&#8208;value functionalized phthalazines was developed. Combining a facile light&#8208;mediated enolization of o&#8208;methyl benzophenones/Diels&#8208;Alder reaction domino process with a subsequent deprotection/aromatization domino reaction leads to waste&#8208;reducing and cost&#8208;effective synthesis of new antiviral model drugs.







Abstract
We report the development of a metal&#8208;free four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy to access high&#8208;value functionalized phthalazines using o&#8208;methyl benzophenones as starting compounds. Combining a light&#8208;mediated enolization of o&#8208;methyl benzophenones/Diels&#8208;Alder reaction domino process with a subsequent deprotection/aromatization domino reaction in one&#8208;pot leads to sustainable and efficient organic synthesis. The tangible advantages, i.&#8201;e., absence of catalysts or additives, utilization of commercially available and/or easily accessible substrates, mild reaction conditions, simplicity, and single work&#8208;up procedure, make this combined process highly appealing for the direct construction of various 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;phthalazines. Importantly, in&#8197;vitro bioactivity evaluation of these newly prepared heterocyclic compounds demonstrated a strong antiviral efficacy against major human pathogens like HCMV and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

The tangible advantages, i.&#8201;e., absence of catalysts or additives, utilization of commercially available and/or easily accessible substrates, mild reaction conditions, simplicity, and single work-up procedure, make this combined process highly appealing for the direct construction of various 1-aryl-phthalazines. Importantly, &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; bioactivity evaluation of these newly prepared heterocyclic compounds demonstrated a strong antiviral efficacy against major human pathogens like HCMV and SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C Bond Formation Using Alkenes as Substrates: Insight into Recent Enantioselective Developments</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective mono&#8208; and difunctionalization of alkenes, involving C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C bond formation, are discussed, highlighting the fundamental role of ligands and reaction conditions optimization. This review summarizes the significant advances made over the last years and provides tools for developing new enantioselective transformations.







Abstract
This Review summarizes the advances in the catalytic enantioselective mono&#8208; and difunctionalization of alkenes, highlighting the fundamental role of ligands. Several types of asymmetric reactions have been developed involving different bonds formation, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C, highlighting the urgency to go ahead in the search for new ligands and synthetic methodologies in order to improve the control over the reaction selectivity and activity and thus, to increase the applications in the synthesis of heterocyclic scaffolds and biologically active compounds. The Review is organized into paragraphs, which discuss the type of bond formed during the nucleopalladation, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C bonds, and the type of reaction involved.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Development and Synthesis of Carbohydrate&#8208;Based Molecules with Promising Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the potential of carbohydrates as starting materials for the synthesis of antimicrobial agents is explored. The most recent and successful reports of sugar&#8208;based bactericides, bacteriostatic agents, and adhesin binders are covered with focus on the methodologies employed in their synthesis, resulting in a useful compilation of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reactions used in carbohydrate modification.







Abstract
With the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), innovation in antibacterial drug research and development is urgently needed and strongly encouraged by the World Health Organization (WHO). Carbohydrates are valuable bioactive scaffolds to be explored in this context, and because of their unique multifunctionality, stereochemical diversity, and natural protein&#8208;binding profile, they come across as attractive starting materials for the synthesis of antimicrobial agents with innovative mechanisms of action (MoA). In this concise review, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methodologies for the synthesis of an array of promising and recently developed carbohydrate&#8208;based molecules with antibacterial activity are presented and discussed. By describing successful case studies as platforms for the scrutiny of carbohydrate modification and coupling approaches in organic chemistry, this work summarizes the latest research efforts in this area, ultimately encouraging the design and synthesis of new and much&#8208;needed glycoantibiotic leads for pharmaceutical development.

         <dc:description>An electrochemical bromination of thiophenes from ammonium bromide is developed both in batch and continuous&#8208;flow conditions. Substituted thiophenes possessing 2&#8208;hydrogens selectively afford a series of 2&#8208;bromothiophenes while 2&#8208;substituted benzothiophenes generate 3&#8208;bromobenzo[b]thiophenes. Based on the cyclic voltammetric studies and literature, a bromine cation involved mechanism was proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Free Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Mizoroki&#8208;Heck Reaction Strategy for the One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Functionalized Oxygen Heterocycles in Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligandless, telescoped, one&#8208;pot reductive Mizoroki&#8208;Heck reactions proceed smoothly and regioselectively in eco&#8208;friendly eutectic mixtures, and under aerobic conditions to yield 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl THF or THP derivatives in up to 95&#8201;% yield. Key intermediates have also been targeted in DES en route to pharmacologically relevant molecules.







Abstract
A Deep Eutectic Solvent, choline chloride/glycerol (1&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;mol&#8201;mol&#8722;1), proved to be an effective and sustainable reaction medium to promote telescoped, one&#8208;pot Mizoroki&#8208;Heck cross&#8208;coupling/reduction processes between 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran or 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran and several (hetero)aryl halides to easily access valuable 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl tetrahydrofuran (THF) or tetrahydropyran derivatives in up to 95&#8201;% yield. Notably, the whole transformation takes place under aerobic conditions, in the absence of additional ligands, and with a good substrate scope. The practicability of the method is also exemplified by the sustainable synthesis of two key THF derivatives, which are side chains of pharmacologically relevant inhibitors of Kv1.2 channel.
