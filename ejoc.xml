         <title>Effect of Solvate Ionic Liquids in the Enantioselective (S)&#8208;Proline&#8208;Catalyzed Mechanochemical Robinson Annulation.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report our observations from the study of the classical Robinson annulation reaction under solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical activation by means of high&#8208;speed ball milling. In particular, the enantioselective synthesis of the Wieland&#8208;Miescher ketone was used as model reaction. (S)&#8208;Proline was employed as chiral organocatalyst, either alone or in the presence of additives in order to determine their influence on the reaction&#8217;s speed and stereoselectivity. Most interesting, among the additives that were examined, four solvate ionic liquids (SIL) afforded the desired product with significantly improved enantioselectivity relative to the mechanochemically&#8208;activated reaction catalyzed by (S)&#8208;proline alone. Furthermore, the required reaction time was reduced from 3 days to 90 min. The potential of other proline&#8208;type organocatalysts was explored in this ball&#8208;milling process. &#160;Initial attempts to increase the scope of the reaction to afford related annulation products were unsuccessful. HPLC&#8208;MS experiments were carried out in order to detect some of the species that intervene in the mechanism of the (S)&#8208;proline&#8208;catalyzed Robinson cyclization reaction involving 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclohexanedione and methyl vinyl ketone.</dc:description>

         <title>Experiment Meets Theory: Cope Rearrangements and Thermal E/Z Isomerisations of Terpenoid Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several terpenes are known that can undergo a Cope rearrangement. Prominent examples include germacrene A and hedycaryol that show a Cope rearrangement already slightly above room temperature. In the present study the Cope rearrangements of several terpenes and eventually co&#8208;occurring thermal E/Z isomerisations were investigated experimentally for their minimum required temperatures and for their states of equilibrium. The experimental findings were supported by computational assessments of free activation energies (&#916;G&#8225;) as well as relative Gibbs free energies of the reactants (&#916;G).</dc:description>

         <title>Towards the Stable Binding of Mercury: Synthesis and Functionalization of Dibenzyldiazabicyclononane Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mercury was safely caged into a dibenzyldiazabicyclononane scaffold to ensure the stable preparation of organomercurials for later radiotracer applications in nuclear medicine. The chosen synthesis route opens the easy introduction of different leaving groups for the mercuration process. A further functionalization of the diazabicyclononane C&#8208;9 position allows the connection of biomolecules via click chemistry.







Abstract
A universally applicable synthesis route for the preparation of functionalized diazabicyclononane compounds was elaborated starting from a readily available 1,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;3,7&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1] nonan&#8208;9&#8208;ol by alkylation of both secondary amines with modified benzyl residues containing a bromo, trimethylstannyl, trimethylsilyl, and pinacolboranyl residue. High yields (65&#8211;88&#8201;%) were achieved, supporting the intended purpose of these compounds: efficient mercuration reactions to stably bind Hg2+. Finally, the C&#8208;9 position of two functionalized diazabicyclononanes was further modified by introducing an azide functionality. This enables the conjugation to biomolecules of interest via click chemistry combined with a tracking by the introduced mercury isotopes.

         <title>Electrochemically&#8208;Enabled Construction of N&#8208;Acyl Iminophosphoranes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical enabled construction of N&#8208;acyl iminophosphoranes via unprotected amide radical or radical anion. This simple electrochemical construction of N&#8208;acyl iminophosphoranes has good scalability, practicability and extensibility. Furthermore, synthetic transformations of the N&#8208;acyl iminophosphorane products have demonstrated the application potentials of the P=N bond.







Abstract
N&#8208;acyl iminophosphoranes have shown significant potentials in various areas. This paper presents two electrochemical strategies for the successful construction of a series of substituted N&#8208;acyl iminophosphoranes using electrochemical activation of hydroxylamines or dioxazolones to generate unprotected amide radicals and radical anions. The simple undivided cell with inexpensive electrode setups (graphite felts, carbon rods, and copper sheets) provides excellent substrates tolerance under mild conditions. This simple electrochemical construction of N&#8208;acyl iminophosphoranes also has good scalability, practicability and extensibility. Furthermore, synthetic transformations of the N&#8208;acyl iminophosphorane products have demonstrated the application potentials of the P=N bond.

         <title>Selective Oxidation of Sufur&#8208;Containing Flavones: Synthesis of Sulfoxide/Sulfone&#8208;Flavonoids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocol for the selective oxidation of flavones, providing various sulfoxide/sulfone&#8208;flavonoids in excellent yields. This strategy features excellent selectivities, high yields and broad substrate scope. It should be noteworthy that a class of novel sulfone&#8208;flavonols is also synthesized through triple oxidation. Moreover, the glycosylation of sulfone&#8208;flavonols has been realized.

The combination of oxone (2KHSO5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;KHSO&#8201;4&#8901;&#8201;K2SO4) as the sole oxidant and NaHCO3/Na2CO3 as the buffer play an important role in the process, in which the amounts of oxone and reaction temperatures are the key to the outstanding selectivities and high efficiency of the reaction.

         <title>Photoinduced Remote Selective C(sp3)&#8722;H Alkylation Mediated by Cesium Formate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoinduced cesium formate mediated remote selective C(sp3)&#8722;H alkylation of protected amines were developed under mild reaction conditions in absence of external photocatalyst. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the cesium formate act as a source of carbon dioxide radical anion and hydrogen atom donor.







Abstract
Herein, we developed a photoinduced remote selective C(sp3)&#8722;H alkylation of protected amines in the presence of cesium formate. The protected amines were synthesized from commercially available inexpensive 2&#8208;iodo benzoyl chloride. Under mild reaction conditions, the in&#8197;situ generated aryl radical is converted to &#945;&#8208;amidoalkyl radical via [1,5]&#8208;HAT process, which combines with different Michael acceptors and affords corresponding alkylation products in good yields.

&lt;p&gt;Photoinduced cesium formate mediated remote selective C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H alkylation of protected amines were developed under mild reaction conditions in absence of external photocatalyst. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the cesium formate act as a source of carbon dioxide radical anion and hydrogen atom donor.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we developed a photoinduced remote selective C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H alkylation of protected amines in the presence of cesium formate. The protected amines were synthesized from commercially available inexpensive 2-iodo benzoyl chloride. Under mild reaction conditions, the in&#8197;situ generated aryl radical is converted to &#945;-amidoalkyl radical via [1,5]-HAT process, which combines with different Michael acceptors and affords corresponding alkylation products in good yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that formate anion acts as a source of carbon dioxide radical anion (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;

         <title>Phthalimide and 3&#8208;Formylindole Derivatives for Oligonucleotide Conjugation by Amide or Oxime Ligation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phthalimide&#8208;hexyl or 3&#8208;formylindole&#8208;hexyl phosphoramidites and solid supports on a tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane scaffold were used to introduce an amine or aldehyde function into oligonucleotides for conjugation by amide bond or oxime ligation.







Abstract
A phthalimide or 3&#8208;formylindole functionality was incorporated into a tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane (THME) scaffold, and the resulting compounds were subsequently transformed into phosphoramidites and solid supports. These building blocks were then used to synthesise oligonucleotides containing amine or aldehyde groups at various positions within their sequences. The resulting modified oligonucleotides were further conjugated through either amide bond formation or oxime ligation. These novel building blocks expand the repertoire of phosphoramidites and solid supports available for modifying oligonucleotides.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Oxidation of Silanes with SF6 for Efficient Synthesis of Siloxanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthesis of siloxanes via visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced oxidation of silanes with SF6 has been established, exhibiting broad substrate scope and high efficiency.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced strategy utilizing sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) as distinctive oxidant and water as the oxygen source to transform silanes into siloxanes has been developed under mild conditions, realizing the efficient utilization and degradation of the strong greenhouse gas, sulfur hexafluoride, simultaneously. Mechanistic experiments demonstrate that the reaction proceeds through a radical pathway, and it has been confirmed that the oxygen atoms in the resulting siloxanes indeed originate from water by isotopic labeling experiments with 18O.

         <title>Controlled Reactivity of Viologens in Alkaline Solutions Via &#160;Cucurbit[7]uril Complexation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of N&#8208;alkyl&#8208; and N&#8208;aryl&#8208;viologens has been studied in alkaline solutions. In this work, we evaluated the deuteration rate of the viologens in D2O solutions of pH values ranging from 7.3 to 12.7. Kinetic experiments and computational calculations showed the high reactivity of H&#8208;C(2) bonds toward deprotonation of N&#8208;aryl&#8208;pyridinium moieties compared to N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;pyridinium moieties, even in hybrid N&#8208;aryl/N&#8208;alkyl dissymmetric viologens. However this high H&#8208;C(2) reactivity in liquid phase contrasted with the proton fragmentation mechanism observed in the gas phase by mass spectrometry. The H/D exchange rate of viologens in very strong alkaline conditions could be significantly reduced using cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) as supramolecular protecting group. Ultimately, CB[7] inclusion led to a selective protection of H&#8208;C(2) group of N&#8208;aryl&#8208;pyridinium of dissymmetric viologens, and induced a supramolecular regioselective deuteration.</dc:description>

However this high H-C(2) reactivity in liquid phase contrasted with the proton fragmentation mechanism observed in the gas phase by mass spectrometry. The H/D exchange rate of viologens in very strong alkaline conditions could be significantly reduced using cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) as supramolecular protecting group. Ultimately, CB[7] inclusion led to a selective protection of H-C(2) group of N-aryl-pyridinium of dissymmetric viologens, and induced a supramolecular regioselective deuteration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Lactones via Electrochemical Sequential Oxidative Process</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we unveil a novel electrochemical oxidative strategy that facilitates the synthesis of lactones from 2&#8208;arylbenzaldehydes and 2&#8208;arylbenzoic acids. Crucially, our method allows for the convergent synthesis of lactones from the combinations of the respective 2&#8208;arylbenzaldehyde and 2&#8208;arylbenzoic acid as starting material, owing to the oxidative process's compatibility within our electrochemical setup. This approach offers a robust and versatile pathway to construct various dibenzopyranones type lactone compounds through an environmentally considerate and economically advantageous process.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Decarboxylation/Mumm Rearrangement towards Imides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemically promoted decarboxylation of readily available carboxylic acid and subsequent Mumm rearrangement to synthesize imides was reported. The reaction features external oxidant&#8208;free, transition metal&#8208;free mild conditions, and good functional group tolerance, affording various imides in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
We report an electrochemically promoted decarboxylation of readily available carboxylic acid and subsequent Mumm rearrangement to synthesize the corresponding imides. The reaction features external oxidant&#8208;free, transition metal&#8208;free mild conditions, and good functional group tolerance, affording various imides in moderate to good yields. Mechanistic studies reveal that the selective oxidation of aliphatic carboxylic acids appears to be the key step in this transformation.

         <title>Benzocoumarin&#8208;Fused Triskelions Exhibit AIEE Due to Inhibited Molecular Inversion</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 23, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triskelion&#8208;shaped AIEgens consisting of benzo[f], [g], and [h]coumarin units (2F, 2G, and 2H) were successfully synthesized through the intramolecular Ullmann coupling. These compounds adopt unique &#960;&#8208;twisted helical geometries because of the fusion mode of the benzocoumarins, and the structural isomers have different molecular thicknesses and planarities. These compounds demonstrate remarkable AIEE behaviour in the aggregated states because molecular inversion is suppressed.







Abstract
Developing aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) is a unique strategy for alleviating concentration quenching of &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic compounds. This AIE behaviour can be induced not only in organic dyes with rotors but also in invertible &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. Herein, intramolecular Ullmann coupling was used to synthesize &#960;&#8208;twisted triskelion&#8208;shaped AIEgens (2F, 2G, and 2H), in which benzo[f], [g], and [h] coumarins were fused into the benzene core to form a helical propeller shape. These structural isomers had unique molecular thicknesses and planarities depending on the fusion mode of the benzocoumarin. The racemic crystals, PPP and MMM, had different overlapping molecular configurations because of their twisted molecular frameworks. Compounds&#8197;2F, 2G and 2H demonstrated weak fluorescence emission in diluted solutions resulting from molecular motions caused by the isomerization process during molecular inversion. By comparison, aggregates exhibited enhanced emission intensity. These &#960;&#8208;twisted triskelions exhibited the characteristics of AIEgens.

         <title>n&#8208;Bu4NI/K2S2O8&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;N Coupling Between Aldehydes and Amides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 23, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An n&#8208;Bu4NI/K2S2O8&#8208;mediated substrate&#8208;dependent C&#8722;N coupling between aldehydes and amides is reported. When an aromatic aldehyde bears electron&#8208;donating groups at either the ortho or para position of the formyl group, a transformylation takes place exclusively. Without these groups, a cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling dominates. Furthermore, when 2&#8208;aminobenzamide is employed, only quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones are obtained regardless of the aldehyde used.







Abstract
n&#8208;Bu4NI/K2S2O8 mediated C&#8722;N coupling between aldehydes and amides is reported. A strong electronic effect is observed on the aromatic aldehyde substrates. The transformylation from aldehyde to amide takes place exclusively when an aromatic aldehyde bears electron&#8208;donating groups at either the ortho or para position of the formyl group, while the cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling dominates in the absence of these groups. Both the density functional theory (DFT) thermochemistry calculations and experimental data support the proposed single electron transfer mechanism with the formation of an acyl radical intermediate in the cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling. The n&#8208;Bu4NI/K2S2O8 mediated oxidative cyclization between 2&#8208;aminobenzamide and aldehydes is also reported, with four quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones prepared in 65&#8211;99&#8201;% yields.

Abstract
We present a method for the synthesis of substituted indolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoline&#8208;5(6H)&#8208;ones starting from 1&#8208;(2&#8208;ethynylphenyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indoles. The transformation involves gold&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of the triple bond followed by acid&#8208;promoted intramolecular cyclization at the indole C2 position. Demonstrating noteworthy versatility, the reaction tolerates a wide array of substituents on the indole core and proceeds in good to excellent yields (up to 93&#8201;%).

         <title>Imidazolium Dicyanomethylides as N&#8208;Ylide Precursors of Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 23, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazolium&#8208;ylides are conjugated mesomeric betaines with an exocyclic anionic carbon substituent. These ylides were converted by deprotonation into anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, which can be formulated with two negative charges on the carbene carbon atom due to their origin. Subsequent reaction with selenium gave anionic selenourea compounds.







Abstract
In the past, the use of nitrogen ylides focused primarily on cycloadditions, where the 1,3&#8208;dipole was used as a building block for the formation of heterocycles such as pyrroles or pyrrolinones. In this work, we present a new perspective on imidazolium dicyanomethylides with their synthesis and utilization as anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). The values of relative carbene formation energies (CREF) for a wide range of substituted imidazolium ylides unknown in the literature showed promising properties. In situ trapping reactions of these anionic NHCs with selenium led to anionic, water&#8208;soluble compounds that exhibited remarkable coordination behavior according to X&#8208;ray structure analyses. In addition, the 77Se shifts of the investigated compounds were measured to draw conclusions about their &#960;&#8208;acceptance.

         <title>Synthesis of a Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane&#8208;Containing Aromatic Lipoxin B4 Analogue and Heteroaromatic Congeners</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 23, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the asymmetric synthesis of an aromatic analogue of lipoxin B4 containing a conformationally rigid and potentially more metabolically resistant bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) ring incorporated into the upper alkyl chain. This was achieved via the design of a key BCP&#8208;containing fragment that could be used as a common intermediate in the synthesis of the target analogue as well as other heteroaromatic congeners.







Abstract
Lipoxins are pro&#8208;resolving mediators that play an important role in the resolution phase of the innate inflammatory response. However, because of their chemical and metabolic instability, the design of more stable synthetic analogues of lipoxin A4 and lipoxin B4 is an ongoing area of study. Herein we report the asymmetric synthesis of an aromatic lipoxin B4 analogue containing a conformationally rigid and potentially more metabolically resistant bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) ring incorporated into the upper alkyl chain. This was achieved by the development of a 9&#8208;step chiral&#8208;pool synthesis of a novel BCP&#8208;containing boronic ester coupling partner which could serve as a common precursor to the target analogue as well as other analogues with further modifications to the aromatic core.

         <title>Commercial Transaminases for the Asymmetric Synthesis of Bulky Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 23, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Commercially available transaminases are valuable tools for the synthesis of chiral amine building blocks and are very accessible to the synthetic chemistry community. We demonstrate that selected commercially available enzymes from Codexis&#8217; transaminase collection can accept and aminate bulky&#8208;bulky ketones in up to 99&#8201;%&#8201;ee.







Abstract
Transaminase&#8208;catalysed asymmetric amination is a valuable transformation for the synthesis of chiral amines. However, its use in synthetic chemistry has been curtailed by a narrow substrate scope and limited information on commercially available catalysts. In this work we have explored the substrate scope of selected commercially available transaminases, focusing on prochiral ketones bearing two bulky substituents and their application in both enzyme&#8208;catalysed and enzyme&#8208;triggered reactions. (R)&#8208; and/or (S)&#8208;selective enzymes converted methyl&#8208;, isopropyl&#8208;, n&#8208;butyl&#8208;, and cyclohexyl&#8208;phenone substrates to the corresponding amines in the range of 6&#8211;&gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee. In some cases, a stereochemical switch was detected, in which (R)&#8208;enantioselectivity was observed with enzymes typically assigned as (S)&#8208;selective. Upscaling of selected biotransformations provided chiral amines, in &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee and up to 40&#8201;% isolated yield. Furthermore, transaminase&#8208;triggered reactions, which were previously limited to methyl&#8208; and ethyl&#8208;derivatives, were expanded to phenyl&#8208;derivatives for the formation of a cis&#8208;2,6&#8208;disubstituted piperidine and 2,4&#8208;diphenyl pyrroline, and isolated in up to 67&#8201;% yield.

         <title>Polymorphism and White Light Emission of 1&#8208;Bromo&#8208;3,5,7&#8208;triphenyladamantane Compared with 1,3,5,7&#8208;Tetraphenyladamantane</title>

         <dc:description>
Substituted diamondoid polymorphs were identified and show different white&#8208;light emission spectra upon continuous infrared laser irradiation. The polymorphicity arises from a competition of London dispersion interactions either as short CH&#8211;&#960; or Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br contacts.







Abstract
Here we report our investigation of 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,5,7&#8208;triphenyladamantane (1) and the elucidation of polymorphic crystals (1&#8201;A and 1&#8201;B) using single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. In the monoclinic crystal system of 1&#8201;A (P21/n), we observed CH&#8211;&#960; interactions, while Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br interactions are absent. Conversely, the Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br interactions are an apparent factor in the formation of the monoclinic crystal system of 1&#8201;B (R

). We compare our findings with 1,3,5,7&#8208;tetraphenyladamantane (2), characterized by numerous CH&#8211;&#960; interactions in the solid. Computational analyses were employed to investigate the interactions within the characteristic dimers present in the unit cells of 1&#8201;A and 1&#8201;B, including visualization of noncovalent interactions and the use of the atoms&#8208;in&#8208;molecules approach as well as MO analyses. These support the notion of London dispersion (LD) dimer&#8208;dimer interactions in 1&#8201;A between the phenyl moieties, whereas 1&#8201;B exhibits additional dimer&#8208;dimer Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br contacts. In contrast, the crystals of 2 are exclusively held together by CH&#8211;&#960; stacking LD interactions, a feature absent in the polymorphs of 1. Both polymorphic forms of 1 emit white light when subjected to 900&#8197;nm continuous wave laser irradiation, displaying a subtle blue shift compared to 2. The absence of CH&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions between the dimers of 1 causes a small red&#8208;shift in the emission spectrum.

         <title>Aerobic Photoredox Catalyzed Oxamate Ester Synthesis from Bromodifluoroacetate Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 23, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel synthetic method for oxamate esters using bromodifluoroacetate esters and amines under aerobic photoredox catalysis. In contrast to previous methods that require the use of moisture&#8208;sensitive precursors and/or harsh conditions, this method utilizes bench&#8208;stable bromodifluoroacetate esters as an oxamate ester precursor under mild conditions, providing a variety of oxamate esters.







Abstract
Here we report an aerobic photoredox catalysis approach to oxamate ester synthesis using bromodifluoroacetate esters and amines under open&#8208;air conditions. Oxamate ester is an important skeleton found in bioactive molecules and used as a synthetic building block. However, previous synthetic methods require the use of moisture&#8208; and air&#8208;sensitive precursors and/or harsh conditions, limiting accessible oxamate esters. The present method uses bench&#8208;stable bromodifluoroacetate esters and amines under mild photoredox catalytic conditions to furnish a wide variety of oxamate esters. Combining photoredox catalysis with aerobic oxygenation enables the use of bromodifluoroacetate ester as a precursor for the synthesis of oxamate esters via fluoroglyoxylate esters.

Described the construction of racemic and enantiopure (D&#8208; and L&#8208;) fluorene&#8208; or fluorenone&#8208;based novel unnatural amino acid scaffolds. A library of fluorene&#8208; or fluorenone motif installed amino acid motifs possessing anti stereochemistry including phenylalanine norvaline, leucine, norleucine, and 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid, alanine, and non&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives was accomplished. This work is a contribution towards enriching fluorene&#8208; or fluorenone&#8208;based (fluorenyl) unnatural amino acid scaffolds.







Abstract
This paper reports the construction of racemic and enantiopure (D&#8208; and L&#8208;) fluorene and fluorenone&#8208;based novel unnatural amino acid derivatives. The Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed bidentate directing group&#8208;aided arylation of prochiral &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds in racemic, enantiopure carboxamides of amino acids with iodofluorenes was reported. The construction of novel examples of fluorene and fluorenone motifs containing amino acids comprising of norvaline, leucine, phenylalanine, norleucine, 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid derivatives having the anti&#8208;stereochemistry (with good enantiopurity) was accomplished. The construction of bis fluorenyl alanine scaffolds and fluorenyl motif&#8208;containing non&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid (aminoalkanoic acid) derivatives was also reported. Examples of removal of the directing group (8&#8208;aminoquinoline) and phthalimide&#8208;protecting group present in the fluorenyl&#8208;based unnatural amino acid derivatives have been shown. Accordingly, fluorene motif&#8208;based amino acid esters and free amino group&#8208;containing unnatural amino acid derivatives were synthesized. The stereochemistry of the major (anti) diastereomers obtained via the prochiral &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H arylation of norvaline, leucine, phenylalanine, norleucine, 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid derivatives was ascertained from the X&#8208;ray structure of a representative compound. Fluorene&#8208; and fluorenone&#8208;based motifs are vital skeletons in materials and medicinal chemistry research. Accordingly, this work is a contribution towards enriching the library of fluorene and fluorenone unnatural amino acid scaffolds.

         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free carbonyl reduction and hydrodefluorination of &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethyl enones with hydrosilanes was developed for the synthesis of a variety of gem&#8208;difluorovinyl alcohols.

Synthetically useful organofluorides could be readily constructed by the further transformations of the obtained products.







Abstract
A tandem carbonyl reduction and hydrodefluorination of &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethyl enones with hydrosilanes under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions was developed for the synthesis of a variety of valuable gem&#8208;difluorovinyl alcohols. The hydrosilane could act as both a reductive agent and a C(sp3)&#8208;F bond&#8208;breaking promoter under mild reaction conditions. Synthetically useful organofluorides, such as gem&#8208;fluorophosphine alkene, gem&#8208;difluorovinyl ketone, and fluorinated dihydrofuran derivatives could be readily constructed by further transformations of the obtained gem&#8208;difluorovinyl alcohols. Moreover, the method features mild reaction conditions, operational simplicity, excellent functional group tolerance, and scalability.

The Pd&#8208;catalysed decarboxylative asymmetric allylic alkylation (DAAA) of sterically hindered &#945;&#8208;aryl,&#946;&#8208;amido allyl ester lactams has been developed. The key step in the synthesis of a range of &#945;&#8208;aryl lactam substrates for catalysis was a Pb&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;arylation. A substrate scope of 11 examples of DAAA showed that products containing the di&#8208;ortho&#8208;methoxy&#8208;substituted phenyls and naphthyl groups gave rise to the highest enantioselctivities of up to 82&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
The Pd&#8208;catalysed decarboxylative asymmetric allylic alkylation (DAAA) of sterically hindered &#945;&#8208;aryl,&#946;&#8208;amido allyl ester lactams has been developed. The key step in the synthesis of a range of &#945;&#8208;aryl lactam substrates for catalysis was a Pb&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;arylation of a &#946;&#8208;amido allyl ester affording 14 novel examples of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amido allyl ester lactams in good yields (up to 80&#8201;%). The Pd&#8208;catalysed DAAA was optimised with the 2,4,6&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl&#8208;containing substrate. Using (S,S)&#8208;DACH&#8208;phenyl Trost as the optimal chiral ligand, enantioselectivities of up to 82&#8201;% ee were obtained. A substrate scope of 11 examples of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amido allyl ester lactams showed that products containing the di&#8208;ortho&#8208;methoxy&#8208;substituted phenyls and naphthyl groups gave rise to the highest ees, whereas products not bearing this substitution pattern showed lower enantioselectivities (&lt;60&#8201;% ee). Transition states to rationalise the observed stereochemical outcome are proposed.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalysed syn&#8208;Selective Arylnickelation and Cyclisation of Ketone/Imine&#8208;Tethered Terminal Alkynes with Arylboronic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 23, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein the substrate scope of a nickel&#8208;catalysed syn&#8208;selective arylnickelation and cyclisation with arylboronic acids is expanded to include ketone and imine&#8208;tethered terminal alkynes. The reaction proceeds via a syn&#8208;aryl nickelation of a terminal alkyne followed by cyclisation of the resulting alkenylnickel species. Along with this the first enantioselective version of the reaction has been developed using PHIM type P,N ligands.







Abstract
Herein we report a syn&#8208;arylnickelative cyclisation with ketone&#8208; and imine&#8208;tethered terminal alkynes (16 examples) in yields of up to 89&#8201;%. The reaction proceeds via a syn&#8208;aryl nickelation of a terminal alkyne followed by cyclisation of the resulting alkenylnickel species onto the ketone or imine. The enantioselective version of this transformation has also been explored with enantioselectivities of up to 83&#8201;:&#8201;17&#8197;er observed.

         <title>Front Cover: Benzocoumarin&#8208;Fused Triskelions Exhibit AIEE Due to Inhibited Molecular Inversion (Eur. J. Org. Chem. 23/2024)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 23, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover illustrates three benzocoumarin (benzo[f], [g], and [h] coumarin)&#8208;fused triskelion&#8208;shaped dyes derived from a parent coumarin&#8208;fused triskelion and their crystal packing. The different positions of the benzo group on the [f], [g], and [h] sites of coumarin give the triskelion&#8208;shaped coumarin platform unique helices, twists, thicknesses, and planarities. This modification also affects the molecular assemblies, the molecular inversion processes, and the emission properties. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Ueda, Y. Mazaki, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/ejoc.202400015).

         <title>Selenosulfones, a Meetup of Chalcogens: A Journey Into Their Recent Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 23, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent chemistry involving selenosulfones is here presented. Their preparation as well as their reactivity in the context of addition reactions, C&#8722;H functionalization and nucleophilic substitution is detailed together with other chemistry involving this functional group. This is the first review article focused on this precise topic ever reported in the literature.







Abstract
A mini review focused on the chemistry of selenosulfones reported since 2019 is here presented. Initially, methods aimed to the preparation of such moiety are discussed. Successively 1,2&#8208;, 1,3&#8208;, 1,4&#8208; and 1,7&#8208;addition reactions to C&#8722;C single and multiple bonds are illustrated. The forth chapter focuses on electrophilic aromatic substitutions. The fifth chapter deals with C&#8722;H functionalizations while the sixth one shows the reactions with aryl diazonium salts or its precursors. The radical coupling with redox active reagents, is the subject of section seventh. Selenosulfones challenged in nucleophilic substitutions and in reactions with phosphorus&#8208;containing compounds are shown in chapter eight and nine followed by the conclusions and perspectives section.

Successively 1,2-, 1,3-, 1,4- and 1,7-addition reactions to C&#8722;C single and multiple bonds are illustrated. The forth chapter focuses on electrophilic aromatic substitutions. The fifth chapter deals with C&#8722;H functionalizations while the sixth one shows the reactions with aryl diazonium salts or its precursors. The radical coupling with redox active reagents, is the subject of section seventh. Selenosulfones challenged in nucleophilic substitutions and in reactions with phosphorus-containing compounds are shown in chapter eight and nine followed by the conclusions and perspectives section.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>4&#8208;Methyltetrahydropyran: A Versatile Alternative Solvent for the Preparation of Chiral BINOL Catalysts and the Asymmetric Alkylation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The beneficial effects of 4&#8208;methyltetrahydropyran (4&#8208;MeTHP) as reaction medium have been highlighted in two organometallic&#8208;mediated transformations performed under bench&#8208;type aerobic conditions. The use of 4&#8208;MeTHP induces a remarkable stability of the organolithium species involved in the anionic Fries rearrangement of binaphthol (BINOL)&#8208;carbamates, and superior performances of 4&#8208;MeTHP than other sustainable solvents have been disclosed in the asymmetric addition of organozinc reagents to aldehydes catalyzed by BINOL&#8208;(bis)carboxamide derivatives.







Abstract
We herein report that the highly hydrophobic ether 4&#8208;MeTHP constitutes a promising resource for the development of sustainable synthetic methodologies grounded on the use of organometallic reagents. The beneficial effects of 4&#8208;MeTHP as reaction medium are illustrated in the organolithium&#8208;promoted anionic ortho&#8208;Fries rearrangement of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL)&#8208;based carbamates under bench&#8208;type conditions. The use of 4&#8208;MeTHP induces a remarkable and unexpected stability of the organolithiums species, enabling the efficient preparation of chiral (bis)carboxamide catalysts. Furthermore, superior performances of 4&#8208;MeTHP than other environmentally responsible solvents are observed using the synthesized BINOL catalysts in the asymmetric addition of organozinc reagents to aldehydes. Spectroscopic studies in solution suggest that 4&#8208;MeTHP plays a key role in these reactions by inducing the preferential formation of a reactive monomeric dinuclear complex. This methodology allows for the asymmetric assembly of enantioenriched secondary alcohols in good yields and high stereoselectivity, working at 0&#8201;&#176;C and under air.

A Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed, concise and direct cyanation of benzylic alcohols using TMSCN as a cyanide source and HFIP as a solvent has been developed. Through this simple and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle method, we have achieved the preparation of intermediates for pharmaceuticals, late&#8208;stage material transformations, and a short&#8208;step enantioselective synthesis of (S)&#8208;verimol F.







Abstract
A concise and direct Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed cyanation of secondary and tertiary benzylic and allylic alcohols has been developed using trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) as a cyanide source and 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) as a solvent. The present transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalytic process is operationally simple to perform under &#8220;open&#8208;flask&#8221; conditions and is applicable to the preparation of a number of &#945;&#8208;arylacetonitriles as well as late&#8208;stage material transformations. The effectiveness of the present protocol was further demonstrated by the first enantioselective synthesis and determination of the absolute configuration of verimol F.

         <title>Synthesis and Optical and Theoretical Characterization of Imidazo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines and Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several new blue light&#8208;emitting imidazo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines were synthesized, and a hypsochromic effect compared to the homolog imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines was observed by UV&#8208;vis&#8208; and fluorescence spectroscopy. The frontier orbital energies were estimated based on cyclic voltammetry and calculated by density functional theory; they correlate with the optical transition energies. Calculated orbital geometries serve to discuss the observed differences in fluorescence spectra and quantum yields.







Abstract
Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines emit intense blue luminescence, suggesting their possible use as emitter molecules in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. We synthesized several new imidazo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines and found they possessed a characteristic hypsochromic effect and even increased quantum efficiency compared to the homolog imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines, as measured by UV&#8208;vis&#8208; and fluorescence spectroscopy in solution. The energies of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals were calculated using density functional theory and experimentally determined by cyclic voltammetry in solution. We obtained a maximum fluorescence quantum yield of 48&#8201;% at 446&#8197;nm for the newly synthesized 3&#8208;(4&#8208;cyanophenyl)&#8208;1&#8208;(pyridyl)imidazo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline with an optimized substitution pattern. For 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridinyl)imidazo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline, a quantum yield of 33&#8201;% was obtained at an even shorter emission wavelength of 431&#8197;nm.

The energies of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals were calculated using density functional theory and experimentally determined by cyclic voltammetry in solution. We obtained a maximum fluorescence quantum yield of 48&#8201;% at 446&#8197;nm for the newly synthesized 3-(4-cyanophenyl)-1-(pyridyl)imidazo[5,1-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]isoquinoline with an optimized substitution pattern. For 1-phenyl-3-(2-pyridinyl)imidazo[5,1-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]isoquinoline, a quantum yield of 33&#8201;% was obtained at an even shorter emission wavelength of 431&#8197;nm.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diaminomaleonitrile &#8211; Mono&#8208;, Di&#8208; &#8230;and Tetraprotonation?!</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DAMN &#8211; that's interesting. Mono&#8208; and diprotonation of diaminomaleonitrile are characterized and discussed. Protonation is possible at either the nitrile or amino moiety. Formed mono&#8208; and dications are characterized by vibrational spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction. Experimental observations are supported by quantum chemical calculations. The formation of an aromatic tetracation is discovered and explained.







Abstract
The successful mono&#8208; and diprotonation of DAMN showed the first site of protonation to be an amino group, while the second protonation occurs at a nitrile group. The prepared salts were characterized by vibrational spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. Under strong superacidic conditions and with sufficient time cyclization of two (di)protonated molecules of DAMN is observed, yielding a tetracationic pyrazine species. Quantum chemical calculations are employed to explain reactivity and properties of compounds shown in the manuscript.

         <title>Potassium tert&#8208;Butoxide&#8208;Promoted Aerobic Dehydrazination of Arylhydrazines: From Arylhydrazines to Substituent Aromatics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficiently aerobic dehydrazination of arylhydrazines promoted by potassium tert&#8208;butoxide (tBuOK) is detailed in this study. This method smoothly produces aromatics analogues from arylhydrazines in the catalytic amount of tBuOK, and can be used to prepare deuterated, iodinated and brominated aromatics as well as aryl chalcogenides.







Abstract
An efficiently aerobic dehydrazination of arylhydrazines promoted by potassium tert&#8208;butoxide (tBuOK) is detailed in this study. This method smoothly produces aromatics analogues from arylhydrazines using catalytic amount of tBuOK under practical conditions, exhibiting excellent functional group tolerance and a broad substrate scope. The application potential of this approach is further demonstrated through the preparation of deuterated, iodinated and brominated aromatics. Moreover, it shows that this aerobic base&#8208;mediated dehydrazination could be utilized to prepare unsymmetrical aryl sulfides, selenides and tellurides with high efficiency.

         <dc:description>Carbazole derivatives are vital in medicinal and materials chemistry, yet accessing diverse substitutions remains challenging. Here, we introduce a regioselective approach for C1 and C8 alkynylation of carbazoles via palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8210;H activation. This method provides a direct route to mono&#8208; and di&#8208;alkynylated derivatives, addressing the scarcity of alkynylated carbazole&#8208;based materials. Our study broadens the synthetic toolbox for carbazole functionalization, offering potential applications in optoelectronics, bio&#8208;imaging, and beyond, while contributing to developing sustainable C&#8210;H activation methodologies.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Azide Alkyne Cycloaddition (RuAAC) provides selective access to both 1,5&#8208;disubstituted and 1,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles in a single step from alkynes and organic azides. The reaction has quickly made its mark in a wide range of areas, spanning from peptidomimetics and antibacterials, to the preparation of functionalized materials and photoswitches. This review covers progress in RuAAC from 2016 and onwards.







Abstract
The ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (RuAAC) gives access to 1,5&#8208;disubstitued triazoles in a single atom&#8208;economical step and offers advantages compared to its copper&#8208;catalyzed counterpart in that both terminal and internal alkynes can be employed. This review summarizes recent findings in this field during the last eight years, covering mechanistic investigations, synthetic developments, as well as applications in medicinal chemistry, polymer synthesis and physical organic chemistry.

         <title>EDA Complex from BCP&#8208;Thianthrenium Salt: A Catalyst&#8208;Free Strategy To Access 1&#8208;Trifluoromethyl&#8208;3&#8208;quinoxaline Derivatives Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example used BCP thianthrenium salts to construct an EDA complex, providing a catalyst&#8208;free and mild protocol to obtain 1&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;3&#8208;quinoxaline derivatives bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes in high yields under photo&#8208;induced condition (36 examples), with structural modifications to the bioactive molecule derivatives also successfully implemented.







Abstract
The construction of bicyclo[1.1.1.]pentanes (BCPs) typically require the cumbersome use of labile [1.1.1.]propellane in solution and involve multicomponent radical reactions, which commonly produce undesired by&#8208;products that hinder the efficient construction of BCPs. In this paper, we present a catalyst&#8208;free strategy by constructing an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex utilizing the naturally electron&#8208;deficient nature of BCP thianthrenium salt, which were irradiated with visible light to obtain trifluoromethyl&#8208;BCP radicals through a SET process, subsequently reacted with various substituted quinoxalines. Moreover, the successful structural modification of drug molecule derivatives confirm the utility of this scheme in the field of drug discovery.

In this paper, we present a catalyst-free strategy by constructing an electron donor-acceptor (EDA) complex utilizing the naturally electron-deficient nature of BCP thianthrenium salt, which were irradiated with visible light to obtain trifluoromethyl-BCP radicals through a SET process, subsequently reacted with various substituted quinoxalines. Moreover, the successful structural modification of drug molecule derivatives confirm the utility of this scheme in the field of drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In DFT We Trust: Exhaustive Exploration of 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions Between Nitrones and Levoglucosenone Exposes a Curious Case of Conformational Dynamics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An experimental and computational study (including DFT calculations and distortion/interaction analysis) was conducted to assess the effect of the nitrone structure in the outcome of dipolar 1,3&#8208;cycloadditions with levoglucosenone, a biomass derived chiral enone. While B3LYP/6&#8208;31G* (the most popular method for modeling these reactions according to our literature search) provides qualitatively good results, large outliers were found for some systems. An exhaustive exploration of other levels allowed us to determine the most appropriate ones to predict simultaneously reactivity and selectivity. The systematically predicted high exo selectivity by the majority of the levels led us to reconsider our initial assignment for the reaction with the nitrone derived from piperidine, which resulted in the discovery of an interesting case of conformational dynamics.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnetically Reusable Fe3O4&#8208;CuO Nanoparticles as Catalysts for the&#160;Synthesis of Aryl&#8208;Substituted Fluorescent Pyrazines for Fe Sensing and Ink Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. Synthesis of substituted pyrazines from readily available methyl aryl/heteroaryl ketones and 1,2&#8208;diamines were achieved using highly stable and reusable ferrite stabilized copper nanoparticles (Fe3O4&#8208;CuO) as catalyst. The reaction proceeds via cascade imine formation&#8208;oxidative cyclization method under oxygen atmosphere. The nanocatalysts were easily recovered and reused upto three consecutive cycles without any significant decrease in particle size, catalytic activity and reaction yield as evidenced from analytical techniques such as Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Powder X&#8208;Ray Diffraction (PXRD). The synthesized pyrazines exhibited photophysical ,&#160;behaviour, displayed large stoke shift and explored as fluorescent probe for the sensitive as well as selective &#8220;turn&#8208;off&#8221; detection of iron with a limit of detection of 0.63 &#181;M. The sensing method has also useful for the quantification of iron in spiked water samples. Furthermore, the application of luminescent pyrazine as fluorescent ink was successfully demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The regiospecific C&#945;&#8211;C&#946; cleavage of allylic alcohols under modified aerobic Mukaiyama hydration conditions is presented. The new methodology can be regarded as an equivalent of a two&#8208;step process, a typical hydration of the parent allylic alcohol followed by a 1,2&#8208;diol cleavage. A broad scope of substrates, both cyclic and acyclic, are applicable, thus introducing substantial structural modification to the core, especially of the former type of substrates. Mechanistic investigation of the reaction reveals the importance of the nearby hydroxyl group for the deviation from the typical Mukaiyama hydration pathway.</dc:description>

In this context, we harness the capabilities of these heterocycles in four different isocyanide&#8208;based multicomponent reactions. Our goal was to create libraries of compounds with functional groups and vectors that are compatible for structural elaboration and optimization of their physical properties. We synthesized 15 unprecedented compounds with high diversity and complexity, whereas we have obtained four single crystal structures of each scaffold, unraveling their geometrical features and potential employment in drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
An organocatalytic direct aldol reaction of &#945;&#8208;azido ketones and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl pyruvate for the diastereoselective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;CF3 organoazides with contiguous tetrasubstituted carbons is described, providing access to valuable multifunctional trifluoromethyl organoazides in good to excellent yields, with moderate diastereoselectivities.







Abstract
A direct diastereoselective aldol reaction of cyclic or acyclic &#945;&#8208;azido ketones with &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl (CF3) pyruvate catalysed by DABCO is developed, which allowed the facile access of CF3&#8208;containing multifunctional organoazides with vicinal tetrasubstituted carbons in good to high yields and diastereoselectivities. Moreover, phenylethynyl trifluoro&#8208; and difluoromethyl ketones are also viable substrates. Up to 50&#8201;% enantioselectivity could be obtained in the initial exploration of the catalytic asymmetric variant.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Formyl Group Migration Triggered Remote Desaturation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light photocatalytic formyl group migration&#8208;triggered remote desaturation is realized, producing a library of functionalized trifluoromethylated &#948;,&#1013;&#8208; or &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes in moderate to excellent yields with good functional group tolerance. The controllable installation of three functional groups, such as CF3, CHO, and a C&#8722;C double bond, provides a very attractive protocol for rapid synthesis of complex molecules from simple starting materials.







Abstract
Dehydrogenation of unactivated alkanes to form versatile alkenes is an important but challenging task in synthetic chemistry. Enabled by a radical&#8208;mediated formyl group migration, a novel visible light&#8208;induced remote desaturation of aldehydes is developed, delivering a panel of trifluoromethylated &#948;,&#1013;&#8208; or &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes in moderate to excellent yields with good functional group tolerance at room temperature. Mechanistic studies indicate a reaction pathway comprising the cascade trifluoromethylation of C&#8722;C double bonds, intramolecular addition to aldehydes, &#946;&#8208;fragmentation of alkoxy radicals, single electron transfer oxidation, and deprotonation. It provides a good complementary approach to the existing desaturation protocols.

Abstract
We report the construction of C5&#8208;indole unnatural amino acid derivatives via the diastereoselective Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed prochiral &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H arylation of racemic (DL), and enantiopure L&#8208; and D&#8208;carboxamides of amino acids with 5&#8208;iodoindoles. Independently, indole&#8208;based compounds and amino acid motifs are important small molecules in organic synthesis and drug discovery research. This report aimed to contribute to enriching the library of indole&#8208;based unnatural amino acid derivatives. The synthesis of examples of C5&#8208;indole motif&#8208;installed amino acid derivatives comprising norvaline, phenylalanine, leucine, norleucine, 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid having anti&#8208;stereochemistry was accomplished. The synthesis of the C5&#8208;indole motif&#8208;containing non&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid (aminoalkanoic acid) derivatives was also reported. The C&#8722;H arylation reactions of racemic and enantiopure carboxamides with 5&#8208;iodoindoles afforded the corresponding indole unnatural amino acid derivatives with good diastereoselectivity (anti, dr&gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 and enantiopurity (er up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1). Removal of the directing group (8&#8208;aminoquinoline), phthalimide group and preparation of indole amino acid esters and free amino group&#8208;containing indole unnatural amino acid motifs were also shown. The utility of the methodology was shown by synthesizing indole motif&#8208;containing pyrrolidone and peptide molecules. The stereochemistry of the major (anti) diastereomers was ascertained from the X&#8208;ray structure of a representative compound.

         <title>Organocatalytic Activation of Unsymmetrical 2,3&#8208;Diketones towards Catalytic Asymmetric Domino Michael&#8211;Henry Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we explored a method to distinguish between both enolizable regions of unsymmetrical 2,3&#8208;diketones in organocatalytic domino reactions involving nitroalkenes. The selective formation of an enamine from only one side of the molecule was made possible by the use of optically pure 2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)pyrrolidine. This catalyst, remarkably enhancing the reaction, owes its efficacy to a unique interplay between basicity and nucleophilicity. These features caused the enolization of the substrate at the second possible site to be omitted. The approach resulted in excellent regio&#8208; diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity (91&#8208;99% ee) across various nitroalkenes, leading to the synthesis of novel cyclopentanone derivatives with three contiguous stereogenic center.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of (E)&#8208;Enaminoesters by a 1,6&#8208;Addition/Fragmentation Cascade Involving Coumalic Acid Esters and Secondary Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coumalic acid methyl ester (methyl coumalate), a biomass&#8208;derived building block, was converted into (E)&#8208;enaminoesters by an original uncatalyzed stereoselective 1,6&#8208;addition/fragmentation cascade involving secondary amines. The transformation occurred under useful experimental conditions as a simple heating of a stoichiometric mixture of the starting compounds led to the desired products. The reaction could be extended to a range of alkyl coumalates and a variety of secondary amines. Given the original character of the transformation, the reaction mechanism was discussed. Therefore, the cascade is supposed to involve a 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition followed by a fragmentation sequence leading ultimately to the decarboxylative elimination of (E)&#8208;enaminoesters. Using this procedure, renewable coumalic acid proved to be a valuable alternative to fossil fuel&#8208;based propiolates for the preparation of enaminoesters.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Deoxy Pyranosides via Fe(III) Catalyzed Regioselective Thiocarbonylation of Partially Protected Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rapid and efficient synthesis of targeted deoxygenated glycosides is highly desired. Herein, we disclose a two&#8208;step procedure for the synthesis of deoxysugars from partially protected pyranosides via site&#8208;selective thiocarbonylation followed by tin&#8208;free Barton&#8211;McCombie deoxygenation. The selectivity can be smoothly achieved through FeCl3 as the catalyst assisted by low&#8208;priced benzoyl trifluoroacetonate (Hbtfa) ligand in the presence of K2CO3 as base. Further deoxygenation can be carried out using greener silicon reagent, avoiding highly toxic organotin reagents in traditional procedures. Conspicuous features of this method include mild conditions, easy operation, high selectivity and non or low toxic reagents, making it a more attractive strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Optical Property Modulation of Substituted [2.2]Paracylophanes through Through&#8208;Space Conjugation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insights into noncovalent interactions by elucidating the profound impact of through&#8208;space conjugation on the optical properties of [2.2]paracyclophane based through&#8208;space conjugated dimers. Through a experimental investigations the research sheds light on the intricate interplay of extended and space conjugation. Moreover, it explores the application of Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reactions, in tailoring the optical behavior of functional materials.







Abstract
4,16&#8208;para&#8208;substituted [2.2]paracylophanes with naphthalene (PCP&#8208;NAP), anthracene (PCP&#8208;ANTH), and tetraphenylethylene (PCP&#8208;TPE), as new through&#8208;space conjugated dimers, were prepared by the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction of 4,16&#8208;diboryl[2.2]paracyclophane and the corresponding bromo derivative using Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst and KOH as a base. The synthesized compounds were fully characterized by NMR and HR&#8208;MS, and their photophysical and electrochemical properties were studied. The photoluminescence quantum yield of PCP&#8208;NAP, PCP&#8208;ANTH were determined to be 0.21, 0.50, and for PCP&#8208;TPE in aggregated state 0.31, respectively. PCP&#8208;TPE exhibited aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics when the water fraction was greater than 50&#8201;% in THF/water mixtures. PCP&#8208;ANTH and PCP&#8208;TPE were also characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, PCP&#8208;ANTH crystallizes in centrosymmetric monoclinic space group C2/c and PCP&#8208;TPE crystallizes in the centrosymmetric triclinic space group P&#8208;1 with one molecule residing at the inversion center. The observed properties of these &#960;&#8208;stacked dimers were compared with respect to through&#8208;space conjugation and conjugation length in the structure.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Antifungal Agent Voriconazole via Asymmetric Epoxidation of Tetrasubstituted (Z)&#8208;Alkene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of voriconazole, a synthetically challenging antifungal agent was achieved in nine steps with a 8&#8201;% overall yield. This novel strategy relied on the precise synthesis of tetrasubstituted (Z)&#8208;allylic alcohol and the subsequent highly efficient epoxidation to establish the critical contiguous carbon stereocenters in a single step.







Abstract
A concise asymmetric synthesis of triazole antifungal agent voriconazole is described. Salient features of this synthesis include a LiOH&#8208;controlled highly stereospecific formation of (Z)&#8208;enol triflate from 2&#8208;difluorobenzene acetoacetate to access the crucial tetrasubstituted (Z)&#8208;allylic alcohol, and a highly enantioselective VO(OiPr)3/BHA ligand&#8208;catalyzed epoxidation to construct the critical contiguous carbon stereocenters in a single step.

         <title>Organometallic&#8208;Free&#160;Approaches to the Direct Arylation of&#160;Benzoquinones and&#160;Naphthoquinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quinones represent a ubiquitous class of natural products, extensively distributed throughout nature. Within these organisms, they fulfil pivotal roles across a spectrum of metabolic processes essential to the organisms. Their privileged core structure is present in a variety of substances explored in medicinal chemistry. Modification of the central core of quinones could give rise to new substances with great potential as drug candidates. In this context, the introduction of an aryl or heteroaryl moiety on the quinone structure can be an important strategy for the development of new potentially bioactive compounds. In the present work, direct arylation methods of quinones reported in the literature are summarized, restricting the text to methods where organometallics are not used as catalysts, nor are organometallic species formed during the catalytic cycle. Radical arylation methods are presented where diazonium salts, hydrazines and arylboronic acids are used as aryl radicals&#8217; sources, thermally and photochemically generated. Polar reactions are also presented, that is, through nucleophiles and electrophiles. In most reports, rich aromatics acts as nucleophiles against naphthoquinones, whose electrophilicity is increased by an Br&#246;nsted or Lewis acid. Quinones can be the starting materials or generated in situ from phenolic precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>The Environmental Pollutant NO3&#8901; Rapidly Damages Alkene Moieties in Lipids Through Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkene moieties in fatty acids and cholesterol derivatives face high susceptibility to nitrate radical (NO3&#8901;) damage from inhaled air pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO2&#8901;) and ozone (O3). Calculations suggest oxidative electron transfer (ET) involving the C=C bond as initial reaction step. These findings underscore potential health risks associated with combined exposure to environmental NO2&#8901; and O3.







Abstract
The presence of alkene moieties in fatty acids of (phospho)lipids and cholesterol derivatives makes them highly susceptible to damage by nitrate radicals (NO3&#8901;), potentially formed through simultaneous exposure to the environmental air pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO2&#8901;) and ozone (O3). Absolute rate coefficients derived from reactions with simplified model systems range from 4 to 8&#215;109&#8197;M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in acetonitrile, ranking among the highest determined for NO3&#8901; reactions with biomolecules in solution to date. Alkenes featuring an electron&#8208;withdrawing carbonyl substituent also display notable reactivity with k values of (2.5&#177;1.0)&#215;108&#8197;M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Calculations suggest that these reactions are initiated by oxidative electron transfer (ET) involving the C=C bond, followed by recombination of the resulting alkene radical cation with nitrate anion (NO3&#8722;) to form the nitrate adduct radical as the kinetically controlled product. Conversely, saturated fatty acid derivatives and cholestanol react with NO3&#8901; through hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with rate coefficients of 106&#8211;107&#8197;M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, indicating that biomolecules with a considerable number of non&#8208; or moderately activated sp3 C&#8722;H bonds are also highly susceptible to NO3&#8901; attack. These findings underscore the potential health hazards associated with exposure to combined NO2&#8901; and O3 gases.

         <title>Understanding the Role of Internal Lewis Acids in the Catalytic Activity of Urea&#8208;Based Hydrogen Donors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detailed quantum&#8208;chemical calculations have been carried out to understand both the origin of the catalysis in the urea&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening of nitrocyclopropanes and the acceleration induced by the presence of an internal Lewis acid in the catalyst. To this end, the mode of activation of these ureas is quantitatively analyzed in detail by means of the Activation Strain Model of reactivity in combination with the Energy Decomposition Analysis method. It is found that the presence of the Lewis acid in the urea further enhances the interaction between the reactants, by increasing both the electrostatic and orbital attractions, which translates into a reduced activation barrier. This insight is also used to assess the impact of the nature of the Lewis acid on the transformation, facilitating the rational design of more active catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Adventures in the Chemistry of Multicomponent and Domino Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present article presents a personalized review of multicomponent and domino reactions directed towards the synthesis of complex heterocyclic products. Chemistry includes the combination of Knoevenagel with hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, [3+2] cycloadditions and enamine cyclizations. In addition, various formal [3+3] cyclizations of pyridinium salts and domino [4+2]/retro [4+2] reactions are reported.Web: https://langer.chemie.uni&#8208;rostock.de







Abstract
The present personalized account summarizes various cyclization reactions, including multicomponent and domino processes, which are directed towards the synthesis of complex heterocyclic products. Domino Knoevenagel/hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions provide a synthesis of annulated quinol&#8208;2&#8208;ones. The combination of Knoevenagel reactions with [3+2] cycloadditions of nitrogen ylides afford complex spiroheteriocyclic products. Domino Knoevenagel/enamine cyclization reactions result in the formation of condensed purine analogues. Formal [3+3] cyclizations of pyridinium salts allow for a rapid assembly of bridged heterocyclic systems and include the employment of thioxindoles and cyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones as dinucleophilic building blocks. The formal [3+3] cyclization of thioxindoles with fluoroaroyl chlorides, such as 2&#8208;fluorobenzoyl chlorides and 2&#8208;chloropyridine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic chloride, give rise to the synthesis of condensed benzothiophenes. The cyclization of heterocyclic enamines with diimines and triazines afford various purine analogues by domino [4+2]/retro [4+2] reactions. The formal [3+3] cyclization of 2,4,6&#8208;tris(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine with 1,3&#8208;bis(silyloxy)&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadienes afford, depending on the conditions, 2,6&#8208;bis(trifluoromethy)pyrid&#8208;4&#8208;ones or triazaadamantanone derivatives. Heating of 2&#8208;ethynylpyridines with electron&#8208;rich dienes afforded 2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyphenyl)pyridines by a domino [4+2]/retro [4+2] process. The reaction of 2&#8208;ethynylpyridines with enones afforded indolizines by a formal [3+3] cyclization. The reaction of trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;diketones with lithiated alkynes afforded 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;pent&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ones. Formal [5+1] cyclization of the latter with urea afforded trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted pyridines. The Pd catalyzed formal [3+2] cyclizations of 2,3&#8208;dihalopyridines with imines afforded a series of regioisomeric 4&#8208; and 7&#8208;azaindoles.

         <title>Bimetallic Ru(II) Complex Catalysed &#946;&#8208;Alkylation of Secondary Alcohols and &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Ketones: Selective Formation of Saturated Ketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudo&#8208;C2 symmetric Ru(II) catalysts (Cat2 and Cat3) offer an efficient and practical route to &#945;&#8208;alkylated saturated ketones through either &#946;&#8208;alkylation of secondary alcohols or &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones, with high selectivity and scalability for small catalyst loadings.







Abstract
Ru(II) bimetallic [(p&#8208;cymene)2(RuCl)2L1]2X (X=BF4 (Cat2); X=PF6 (Cat3)) and monometallic [(p&#8208;cymene)(RuCl)L2]BF4 (Cat4) (where L1=N,N&#8217;&#8208;(3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetraisopropyl&#8208;[1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8208;diyl)bis(1&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanimine); L2=N&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;phenyl)&#8208;1&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;methanimine) catalyse selective synthesis of saturated ketones using &#946;&#8208;alkylation of secondary alcohol or &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones with primary alcohol. Notably, a single catalyst facilitates the oxidation of both secondary and primary alcohols followed by condensation and hydrogenation yielding &#945;&#8208;alkylated saturated ketones. Remarkably, this system allows catalyst loading as low as 0.01&#8197;mol% for &#946;&#8208;alkylation of secondary alcohols and 0.005&#8197;mol% for the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketone, delivering access to a wide array of &#945;&#8208;alkylated ketones derivatives with yields of ~97&#8201;%. Complex Cat2, in particular, orchestrates one&#8208;pot alkylation reactions with a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 5.6

105&#8197;h&#8722;1 using as low as low catalyst loading of 0.0001&#8197;mol%. A comparative study between bimetallic and monometallic complexes reveals that complex Cat2 exhibits better selectivity for the formation of saturated ketones presumably owing to a cooperative effect between the metal centres. The scale&#8208;up synthesis highlights the practical applicability of the catalytic approach. To delve into the plausible mechanisms, we conducted initial investigations through meticulously controlled experiments and spectroscopic analysis.

         <dc:description>The formation of carbon&#8208;fluorine (C&#8208;F) bonds is an important research field in organic synthesis because the insertion of a fluorine atom into an organic compound can alter its physicochemical properties, such as metabolic stability and permeability. Due to this unique property, organic fluorinated compounds, especially aryl fluorides, have a wide range of applications in various fields, including agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and materials science. Therefore, numerous metal&#8208; or metal&#8208;free&#8208;mediated fluorination reactions have been developed to synthesize aryl fluorides. In this mini&#8208;review, we summarize recent ten years&#8217; advances in fluorination reactions for the synthesis of aryl fluorides.</dc:description>

         <title>Topological Structural Chemistry of Fused Bicycloalkanes Allowing Homeomorphic Conversions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fused bicycloalkanes have several structures with different orientations of the substituents, such as out,out&#8208;, in,in&#8208;, and in,out&#8208;structures. Some bicycloalkanes can undergo homeomorphic conversions between out,out&#8208; and in,in&#8208;structures, as well as between in,out&#8208; and out,in&#8208;structures. This homeomorphism can be achieved by one chain passing through the macro ring. In this report, the topological structural chemistry of these compounds was reviewed.







Abstract
Fused bicycloalkanes have several structures with different orientations of the substituents, such as out,out&#8208;, in,in, and in,out&#8208;structures. Some bicycloalkanes can undergo homeomorphic conversions between certain structures, for instance an out,out&#8208;structure can convert to an in,in&#8208;structure. This homeomorphism can be achieved by one chain passing through the macroring. In this report, topological structural chemistry of fused bicycloalkanes and their analogues allowing homeomorphic conversions were reviewed. Although the concept of homeomorphism in fused bicycloalkanes was proposed 50&#8197;years ago, comprehensive research on their structural chemistry is still ongoing. These understandings are highly relevant to the fundamentals of many fields of chemistry, including structural chemistry, theoretical chemistry, natural products chemistry, and materials science.

         <title>Streamlined Electrochemical Dihalogenation (F, Cl, and Br) of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes Using Hydrogen Halides as Reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We established a straightforward electrochemical dihalogenation (F, Cl, and Br) process for gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. This reaction exhibits a broad functional group tolerance and has been effectively utilized in the construction of complex molecules. The subsequent synthetic transformations of the products have highlighted the adaptable nature of the dihalogenated compounds, demonstrating their potential application in drug discovery and the investigation of innovative materials. The effective utilization of the dihalogenated product for 18F&#8208;labeling represents a novel approach in generating highly potent 18F&#8208;labeled tracers.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Hydroxyethylation of Phenols with Renewable Ethylene Glycol Diester as an Alternative to Ethylene Oxide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed, solvent&#8208;free hydroxyethylation strategy that converts phenols into phenoxyethanol esters is reported. Ethylene glycol diesters are used as renewable and safe alternatives to the harmful ethylene oxide. Oligomerization byproducts from ethylene oxide are also avoided. Applications are demonstrated in upcycling of polyester plastics and preparation of bioactive chemicals.







Abstract
Polyol esters are abundant bio&#8208;based resources. Integration of polyol esters into the production chain of fine chemicals would reduce carbon emissions and improve the sustainability of the chemical industry. An efficient synthetic route to phenoxyethanols was developed through catalytic hydroxyethylation of phenols with ethylene glycol diacetate as the reagent. This method showed the potential of ethylene glycol diester as a safe and sustainable substitute for ethylene oxide, a useful but toxic reagent. A variety of phenoxyethanol esters were produced in high yield under simple catalytic conditions. Mechanistic studies revealed that the reaction underwent a neighboring group participation process.

         <title>Effect of Tether Length on endo/exo Stereoselectivity in Alkene&#8211;Arene meta&#8208;Photocycloaddition Reactions towards the Aphidocolin/Stemodin Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular alkene&#8208;arene meta&#8208;photocycloaddition reactions are powerful &#8216;reagentless&#8217; transformations that form complex three&#8208;dimensional fused&#8208;ring systems from readily accessible starting materials. By judicious tether design in combination with continuous flow it is demonstrated that substrates with a four&#8208;membered tether can also undergo meta&#8208;photocycloaddition in good yield, enabling access to natural product skeletons.







Abstract
Intramolecular alkene&#8208;arene meta&#8208;photocycloadditions are powerful transformations that use the enhanced reactivity of photoexcited benzene rings to facilitate addition of an alkene 1,3 across donor groups and form complex three&#8208;dimensional fused&#8208;ring systems from readily accessible starting materials. Intramolecular examples have traditionally been restricted to three&#8208;membered tethers, with cycloaddition resulting from exo&#8208;conformation. However, by judicious tether design we have demonstrated that a four&#8208;membered tether can also proceed in good yield; interestingly, via an endo exciplex (1.2&#8201;:&#8201;1) enabling access to both natural product skeletons and interesting scaffolds for medicinal chemistry research.

         <title>Modular Access to Tetrasubstituted N&#8722;H Pyrroles by Catalytic 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of Azomethine Ylides and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Ynones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrasubstituted N&#8722;H pyrroles were accessed through the tandem copper(II)&#8208;catalyzed 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;ynones and glycine iminoesters, followed by a copper(II)&#8208;promoted oxidative dehydrogenative aromatization reaction in air. Fully substituted pyrroles could then be obtained by N&#8208;alkylation.







Abstract
The development of efficient synthetic strategies for the preparation of tetrasubstituted N&#8722;H pyrrole derivatives, especially in an environmentally benign fashion is important yet challenging. Herein, we report a copper(II)&#8208;catalyzed tandem reaction involving 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;ynones and glycine iminoesters, followed by copper(II)&#8208;promoted oxidative (air) dehydrogenative aromatization, allowing de novo access to tetrasubstituted N&#8722;H pyrroles in up to 81&#8201;% yield under green reaction conditions. A possible reaction pathway is tentatively proposed. Finally, fully substituted pyrroles are available by N&#8208;alkylation, and a preliminary phase&#8208;transfer catalytic asymmetric N&#8208;alkylation was also studied to give an axially chiral pyrrole.

         <title>Multicomponent Tandem Cyclization/Aromatization Reaction: Access to 2&#8208;Substituted Naphthothiazoles and Benzothiazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multicomponent tandem cyclization and aromatization approach is introduced for the synthesis of naphthothiazoles and benzothiazoles from &#945;&#8208;tetralones and cyclohexenones, respectively. Styrene derivatives were employed to generate one&#8208;carbon synthons through C=C bond cleavage, while an ammonium salt served as the nitrogen source and elemental sulfur served both as the sulfur source and oxidant.







Abstract
A straightforward, metal&#8208;free multicomponent tandem cyclization/aromatization approach for the synthesis of naphthothiazoles and benzothiazoles is described. This method employs &#945;&#8208;tetralones and cyclohexenones as the starting materials, styrene derivatives as a one&#8208;carbon synthon, an ammonium salt as the N source, elemental sulfur as the S source and an oxidant. This approach offers a broad substrate scope, including &#945;&#8208;tetralones and cyclohexenones adorned with different functional groups, resulting in moderate to high yields of the desired products.

         <title>Fusion of Cyclohepta[def]fluorene Units: Toward Synthesis of High&#8208;Spin Non&#8208;Benzenoid Nanographenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;benzenoid diradicaloid (1) with a triplet ground state was designed by fusing two cyclohepta[def]fluorene units onto one benzene ring. Our synthetic attempts towards 1 involve both oxidation and reduction pathways. In the oxidation path, partially dehydrogenated products 1+H and 1+2H containing an indeno[1,2&#8208;b]fluorene core were obtained. In the reduction path, a new tetraketone precursor (9) with two pairs of pentagons and heptagons was afforded.







Abstract
Non&#8208;benzenoid diradicaloids possessing high&#8208;spin ground states are attractive synthetic targets given their high potential for spintronics and quantum computing. Nevertheless, the synthesis of such compounds remains highly challenging due to their inherent instability. In this work, we present the synthetic attempt towards creating a non&#8208;benzenoid diradicaloid (1) with a triplet ground state by fusing two cyclohepta[def]fluorene units onto a benzene ring. Our synthetic approach involves both oxidation and reduction pathways. In the oxidation path, we obtained the partially dehydrogenated products 1+H and 1+2H containing an indeno[1,2&#8208;b]fluorene core from the tetrahydro precursor (2). However, further dehydrogenation to afford the target molecule (1) did not proceed. On the other hand, with the reduction pathway, a novel tetraketone precursor (9) with two pairs of pentagons and heptagons was successfully synthesized. The subsequent nucleophilic attack however was proved to be difficult probably due to the unselective nucleophilic addition on the zigzag nanographene ketones. Furthermore, UV&#8208;vis absorption, cyclic voltammetry, and theoretical calculations were conducted to explore the optical, electrochemical properties, and aromaticity of all the obtained molecules (1+H, 1+2H and 9). Although the desired target 1 is not achieved, our work provides insight into designing novel high&#8208;spin non&#8208;benzenoid NGs based on nonalternant cyclohepta[def]fluorene system.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct C(sp3)&#8722;H Arylation of 5H&#8208;Imidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoindole Scaffolds With Arylbromides</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient direct C(sp3)&#8722;H (hetero)arylation of of 5H&#8208;imidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoindole scaffolds with arylbromides is described under Pd catalysis affording a wide range of the corresponding arylated compounds on the benzylic position in good yields. This methodology was applied to prepare a neurotransmitter Neuropeptide S antagonist analog illustrating that this methodology can be used for the late stage functionalization to obtain molecules of interest.







Abstract
The study of Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond arylation of methyl 5H&#8208;imidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoindole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates with aryl bromides is reported. This methodology gives ready access to a wide range of methyl 5H&#8208;imidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoindole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates that are monoarylated at their benzylic sites. The C(sp3)&#8722;H bond arylation methodology is driven by regioselectivity under weakly basic conditions avoiding remarkably side C(sp2)&#8722;H poly&#8208;arylation of the (hetero)aromatic unit. The process was applied to the preparation of novel imidazo[2,1&#8208;a]isoindole&#8208;based neurotransmitter Neuropeptide S antagonist analog.

         <title>Mixed Liquid and Solid Phase Synthesis of Isopeptidic Desferrioxamine Analogues for Complexation of Zirconium</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>89Zr has a number of advantageous properties for PET&#8208;imaging, but optimal chelators for its widespread clinical application still need to be found. Tetrahydroxamates derived from the natural siderophore DFOB are promising candidates in this context. This study describes a solid&#8208;phase approach to isopeptide analogs of DFOB (termed ipDFO*) with four hydroxamate groups for stable Zr(IV)&#8208;chelation. The route uses either commercial or easily available Fmoc&#8208;protected precursors and allows the synthesis of ipDFO* and clickable AZA&#8208;ipDFO* derivatives in only a few hours. The solid&#8208;phase synthesis reduces the workload for the synthesis of ipDFO* and AZA&#8208;ipDFO* derivatives thus significantly compared to a previous multistep solution synthesis. The route is also modular and allows the synthesis of various ipDFO* derivatives with variation in the spacer length between the hydroxamate groups. This spacing is a critical parameter for finding the optimal chelator for hard metal cations like Zr(IV). It might thus help to speed up the search for an ideal Zr&#8208;chelator for PET&#8208;imaging and might also allow the extension to other metal cations of different size.</dc:description>

         <title>Factors Governing Chemoselectivity in Alkanolamines: A Panoramic Overview</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The most challenging aspect of chemical synthesis has always been attainment of high chemoselectivity levels. This review will provide a panoramic view on how the innate reactivity of two nearly reactive functional groups (&#8208;O/&#8208;N) can be controlled or reversed for the chemoselective functionalisation in alkanolamines. A comprehensive compilation of reports encasing various methodologies developed to accomplish selective O/N functionalisation in amino alcohols has been documented. In this review, we go over a number of findings that have been studied in recent decades using a variety of synthetic approaches. To help us organize and emphasize the important ideas that have been emerging as a result of these research, we have concentrated on the suggested mechanistic basis of the reactions that are being surveyed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
This article reports a mild protocol for visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated Minisci&#8208;type C&#8722;H alkylation reactions of N&#8208;heteroarenes with 2&#8208;mercaptothiazolinium salts without using extra acids, furnishing the corresponding functionalized N&#8208;heteroarenes in good to high yields.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated radical heteroarylation of 2&#8208;mercaptothiazolinium salts with N&#8208;heteroarenes is reported, furnishing the corresponding functionalized N&#8208;heteroarenes in good to high yields. Various alkyl bromides were converted conveniently into redox&#8208;active thiazolinium salts and subsequently into alkyl radicals by reaction with an excited&#8208;state photocatalyst. This mild protocol permits efficient functionalization of various N&#8208;heteroarenes with a wild range of cyclic and acyclic primary and secondary alkyl groups.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis and Functionalization of tert&#8208;Butylsulfinyl&#8208;2&#8208;(Chlorodiphenylmethyl)Pyrrolidine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
tert&#8208;Butylsulfinyl&#8208;2&#8208;(chlorodiphenylmethyl)pyrrolidine can be obtained in high isolated yield and as a single diastereoisomer by the addition of (chlorodiphenylmethyl)lithium to chiral sulfinyl imines deriving from 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;butyrate. SN1 solvolysis reactions with different alcohols, with or without silver salts, allow access to various chiral diphenylprolinol alkyl ethers, some of which are not easily obtained using the known methods.







Abstract
The addition of the carbenoid species (chlorodiphenylmethyl)lithium to chiral N&#8208;(4&#8208;bromobutylidene)&#8208;2&#8208;methylpropane&#8208;2&#8208;sulfinamide affords in high yield (up to 81&#8201;%) and excellent diastereoselectivity (&gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1) the yet undisclosed tert&#8208;butylsulfinyl&#8208;2&#8208;(chlorodiphenylmethyl)pyrrolidine. Preliminary investigations into SN1 solvolysis reactions of this chloride with different alcohols revealed its potential for further functionalizations leading to differently substituted chiral pyrrolidines, yet showing a relative lability of the tert&#8208;butylsulfinyl chiral auxiliary under the employed reaction conditions. Most notably, reactions with sterically hindered alcohols yielded unprecedented derivatives, not easily obtainable using the currently reported procedures for the stereoselective synthesis of diphenylprolinol derivatives.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Allylation of Isocyanoacetates with Vinyl&#8208;Aziridines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical and efficient protocol has been developed for the direct synthesis of &#945;&#8208;allylated isocyanoacetates through palladium&#8208;catalyzed highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective allylation of &#945;&#8208;isocyanoacetates with vinyl aziridines under mild conditions.







Abstract
The first palladium&#8208;catalyzed allylation of isocyanoacetates with vinyl aziridines has been developed. The reaction conditions were suitable for a variety of &#945;&#8208;aryl isocyanoacetates as well as N&#8208;substituted vinyl aziridines, affording the corresponding allylation products in moderate to high yields (up to 98&#8201;%) along with excellent stereoselectivity and regioselectivity. Transformations of the allylation products into trans&#8208;4,5&#8208;dehydrolysine analogues and a highly functionalized proline ester derivative were further demonstrated, and a preliminary asymmetric version of the reaction has also been evaluated.

         <title>Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Diarylindanones and 2&#8208;Arylindenes from Trisubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Esters Derived from Highly Strained 2,3&#8208;Diarylcyclopropenones by Ring Opening with Coumarin Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and efficient synthetic protocol to access two biologically important scaffolds, 2,3&#8208;diarylindanones and 2&#8208;arylindenes, is described. The modular approach involves ring&#8208;opening of highly strained 2,3&#8208;diarylcyclopropenones with coumarins to form &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters and enables the formation of two different series of indane scaffolds by merely changing the reaction conditions.







Abstract
A novel strategy has been developed for the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;diarylindanones and 2&#8208;arylindenes through the formation of trisubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters by the ring opening of 2,3&#8208;diarylcyclopropenones in the presence of a catalytic amount of TPP under mild reaction conditions. Initially, PPh3 activates the diarycyclopropenone to generate the phosphonium adduct, which simultaneously reacts with 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins to afford &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters instead of Wittig olefination. Subsequently, these &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters undergo a smooth Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization with arenes in the presence of AlCl3 to give a new series of 2,3&#8208;diarylindanones in good to excellent yields. Additionally, the reduction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters with NaBH4 followed by acid&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of the resulting allylic alcohols afforded 2&#8208;arylindenes in good yields. This is the first report on the use of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters as precursors for the synthesis of diarylindanones and arylindenes.

         <title>UNDERSTANDING GOLD&#8208;ALKYNE ACTIVATION FROM BOND DISSOCIATION ENERGIES OF GOLD&#8208;ALKYNE COMPLEXES</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A detailed approach into electronic effects of ligands on gold&#8208;alkyne interactions has been carried out in the gas phase using tandem mass spectrometry. A semi&#8208;empirical method coupled to DFT calculations was used to quantify ligands effects on Au&#8208;CC bond strength. To this end, the critical energies of 16 [L&#8208;Au&#8208;hex&#8208;3&#8208;yne]+ complexes with different L ligands were determined through collision induced dissociation. It was observed that electron&#8208;rich ligands destabilize the gold&#8208;alkyne bond, whereas phosphites and carbenes strengthened it. The influence of alkyne electronic effects on the gold&#8208;alkyne bond has also been studied by dissociation in tandem mass spectrometry on four different alkynes. In an original approach, two successive ion&#8208;molecule reactions within the mass spectrometer were used to measure the relative affinity of gold to an alkyne by exchange reactions. The result is that the more electron&#8208;rich the alkyne, the stronger the gold&#8208;alkyne bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Rh Diene Catalysis under Confinement: Isoxazole Ring&#8208;Contraction in Mesoporous Solids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent immobilization of chiral dienes in mesoporous solids for asymmetric heterogeneous catalysis is highly attractive. In order to study confinement effects in bimolecular vs monomolecular reactions, a series of pseudo&#8208;C2&#8208;symmetrical tetrahydropentalenes was synthesized and immobilized via click reaction on different mesoporous solids (silica, carbon, covalent organic frameworks) and compared with homogeneous conditions. Two types of Rh&#8208;catalyzed reactions were studied: (a) bimolecular nucleophilic 1,2&#8208;additions of phenylboroxine to N&#8208;tosylimine and (b) monomolecular isomerization of isoxazole to 2H&#8208;azirne. Polar support materials performed better than non&#8208;polar ones. Under confinement, bimolecular reactions showed decreased yields, whereas yields in monomolecular reactions were only little affected. Regarding enantioselectivity the opposite trend was observed, i.e. effective enantiocontrol for bimolecular reactions but only little control for monomolecular reactions was found.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalization of 1,3&#8208;Butadiene Derivatives under Photo/Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced or electrochemically catalytic functionalization of 1,3&#8208;butadiene to construct diverse allyl compounds with valuable groups was reviewed. Through direct 1,4&#8208;, 1,2&#8208;, or 2&#8208;functionalization, a lot of functional groups, such as alkyl groups, nucleophilic reagents, phosphoryl groups, aryl groups, or alkyl alcohol, were introduced in mild, green, and atom&#8208;economy conditions.







Abstract
In recent years, the functionalization of 1,3&#8208;butadiene has become an attractive strategy for constructing allyl compounds with molecular and structural complexity, and the current research focuses on synthetic chemistry and organic synthesis. Compared with the traditional synthesis method, the synthesis methods promoted by photochemistry or electrochemistry represent an environmentally friendly and mild strategy. In this review, the functionalization reactions of 1,3&#8208;butadiene under photochemical/electrochemical processes in recent years are reviewed according to the classification of functionalization systems, with particular emphasis on the corresponding reaction mechanism, which lays a foundation for further exploration of new catalytic methods.

         <dc:description>Anodization was employed to treat the aluminum foil surface, leading to in situ the generation of Al2O3, consequently amplifying the specific surface area to aid in the dispersal of palladium nanoparticles. Through the anodic oxidation of aluminum followed by a precipitation&#8208;deposition and calcination process, a highly efficient and reusable Pd/Al2O3/Al monolithic catalyst was synthesized. The effectiveness and reusability of the Pd/Al2O3/Al monolithic catalyst were evaluated in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction. The turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) of the Pd/Al2O3/Al monolithic catalyst reached 73,880 and 0.86 s&#8208;1, respectively. Furthermore, the catalyst could be recovered and reused in reactions regardless of the used substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Monofluoromethylthioesters from Acyl Chlorides with Elemental Sulfur and Fluoroiodomethane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical nickel&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of monofluoromethylthioesters from acyl chlorides has been developed. In this protocol, acyl chloride intermediates were initially formed and then subjected to the nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction with S8 and ICH2F, delivering the corresponding products in moderate to high yields.







Abstract
We report an unprecedented Ni&#8208;catalyzed direct monofluoromethylthiolation of acyl chlorides, in&#8197;situ generated from carboxylic acids, with elemental sulfur (S8) as the S source and fluoroiodomethane (ICH2F) as the CH2F radical source to produce a series of monofluoromethylthioesters in moderate to good yields. This approach features excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. Additionally, the late&#8208;stage monofluoromethylthiolation of complex bioactive molecules can also be accomplished using this method.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, efficient and environmentally friendly method is proposed for the synthesis of a series of structurally diverse phosphine&#8208;glycine derivatives by direct irradiation of glycine derivatives and diarylphosphine oxides with blue visible light at room temperature using only air (oxygen) as an oxidant. A possible mechanism was also proposed in conjunction with controlled experiments.

We herein report a visible light induced dehydrogenative phosphonylation reaction of glycine derivatives and di&#8208;aryl phosphine oxides. A diverse range of phosphine&#8208;glycine derivatives were constructed under ambient condition in the absence of catalyst and additives. A plausible mechanism was also proposed.

         <title>Leveraging Propargyl Sulfides as Radical Trappers for the Synthesis of Sulfonyl Allenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work showcases a novel visible&#8208;light mediated allenylation protocol employing propargyl sulfides as a radical trapping methodology. An array of substituted sulfonyl allenes were successfully synthesized under mild conditions. Mechanistically, this process entails the formation of sulfonyl radicals, their subsequent addition to alkynes, the elimination of S&#8208;centered radicals, and Cl&#8208;atom abstraction, thereby facilitating the propagation of this radical chain reaction.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Driven [3+2] Cycloaddition of Triazine 1&#8208;oxides with Arynes/Cyclooctyne: Access to Benzisoxazoles/Cyclooctyne Fused Isoxazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 4&#8208;carboxylates of 1,2,3&#8208;triazine 1&#8208;oxides undergo [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition with in situ generated benzynes and naphthyne and also with cyclooctyne that, following retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder extrusion of dinitrogen, form isoxazole&#8208;3&#8208;propenoate derivatives in high yields and diastereocontrol. This practical method occurs at room temperature and provides a wide range of isoxazole based heterocycles with diverse functionality. 1,2&#8208;naphthyne, an unsymmetrical alkyne, forms only one regioisomeric product, exemplifying inherent regioselectivity. Although high, stereoselectivity is not 100% in most cases, indicating that the loss of dinitrogen is stepwise. Derivative reactions of benzisoxazoles suggest their versatility.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A KOtBu&#8208;promoted robust strategy has been described for the regioselective synthesis of pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]quinolin&#8208;1&#8208;one and naphthyridin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;one derivatives from o&#8208;alkynylquinolinecarbonitriles in good to excellent yields. The reaction proceeds through in&#8208;situ transformation of nitrile moiety into amide group followed by the selective C&#8208;N bond formation via a 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig or 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig annulation reaction. Among the synthesized derivatives, 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig naphthyridin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones displayed good photophysical properties. The present approach is superior to other established methodologies owing to avoiding use of transition metals and column chromatographic purification and affording the products in high yields.

         <dc:description>Fluorine&#8208;containing compounds are important in medicine or crop&#8208;protection. Herein, we show asymmetric organocatalytic Michael/oxa&#8208;Michael cascade leading to chiral fluorinated pyrans under mechanochemical conditions. Formal oxa&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between fluorine containing unsaturated keto esters and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones afforded a range of drug&#8208;like pyran derivatives in short times and good to high yields. Ball&#8208;milling convey the reaction in short times and high product yields, while keeping high enantiomeric purities of products. The reaction is diastereodivergent depending on the use of either monofunctional amine catalysts or bifunctional thiourea or squaramide.</dc:description>

         <title>Theoretical Mechanism Study of BH3&#8208;Mediated Reduction of P&#8208;Stereogenic Hydroxyalkylphosphine Oxides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The BH3&#8208;mediated reduction of P&#8208;stereogenic hydroxyalkylphosphine oxides was investigated by Density Functional Theory calculations. By combining theoretical approaches with experimental observations, we explored two mechanisms that account for its stereospecificity, implying an inversion of the configuration at the phosphorus atom. One mechanism proceeds through a cyclic intermediate in which the coordination of borane to the oxygen atoms lowers the BH3.THF&#8208;attack barrier. However, the free energy barrier for this combined process is too high for a reaction feasible at room temperature. The calculations rather support a second mechanism that proceeds through from the same cyclic intermediate and the in&#8208;situ formation of BH4&#8208; as reducing agent.</dc:description>

A general method to prepare 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;pyrido[2,3&#8208;b]pyrazines from 3&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;fluoropyridine is described.

Abstract
The electrophilic activation of 2H&#8208;azirines with triflic anhydride (Tf2O) for an addition/cyclization reaction producing 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;pyrido[2,3&#8208;b]pyrazines regioselectively is described. This reaction proceeds via nucleophilic addition of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;fluoropyridines onto 1&#8208;trifloyl&#8208;aziridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl triflates and subsequent cyclization via SNAr. Desulfonylation and oxidation provides a single regioisomer of the aza&#8208;bicyclic heterocycle after treatment with Et3N. Optimization of the reaction conditions lead to a range of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;pyrido[2,3&#8208;b]pyrazines in isolated yields of 20&#8201;% to 60&#8201;%.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Based Deep Eutectic Solvents: Key Players for Amide and Sulfonamide Synthesis and Alcohol Oxidation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective and sustainable oxidation of secondary alcohols to their corresponding carbonyl compounds, alongside their applications as selective mono&#8208;alkylating reagents for both amide and arylsulfonamide derivatives, is achieved under aerobic and mild (40&#8201;&#176;C) conditions in reusable Fe&#8208;based Lewis acidic deep eutectic solvents.







Abstract
A sustainable protocol has been devised for the oxidation of activated secondary alcohols to their corresponding carbonyl compounds, as well as their utilization as selective mono&#8208;alkylating reagents for both amide and arylsulfonamide derivatives. These reactions proceed smoothly and in good yields (up to 98&#8201;%) when conducted in Fe&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents (DESs), which serve dual roles as solvents and catalysts. Operating under mild (40&#8201;&#176;C) and aerobic conditions, these transformations are completed within a 4&#8197;h time frame. A pharmacologically relevant amide derivative, specifically a PMRT1 inhibitor, has also been successfully synthesized on a 3&#8197;g&#8208;scale utilizing a reusable FeCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O/glycerol Lewis acidic DES.

         <title>Recent Progress in the Photocatalytic Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Primary Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Tertiary primary amines (&#945;&#8208;TPAs) bearing a fully substituted carbon center adjacent to the N&#8208;unsubstituted amino group (&#8208;NH2) exhibit unique biochemical and physicochemical activities. While due to the sterically congested structure and strong nucleophilic and alkaline natures of these N&#8208;unsubstituted primary amine compounds, their facile synthesis remains an inherent challenge. Traditional methods commonly rely on tedious N&#8208;protection/deprotection operations and highly reactive organometallic reagents, thus leading to poor atom and step&#8208;economy and limited functional group compatibility. Modern photoredox catalysis offers a robust tool to prepare such structurally unique and synthetically valuable amine architectures via a radical pathway under extremely mild conditions. In this review, the recent progress in photocatalytic synthesis of &#945;&#8208;TPAs is systematically reviewed, and the reaction scope, limitations, and mechanisms for the reactions are discussed.</dc:description>

Different minor diarylated side products were formed, depending on whether electron deficient aryl or pyridyl iodides were used as the coupling partners. Cleavage of the 8&#8208;aminoquinoline directing group provided small bridged compounds that may be of value in fragment based drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new strategy for thiochromen&#8208;4&#8208;one synthesis that relies on the denitrative formal [5 + 1] cycloaddition of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ones with thioacetamide is described. Achieved under reaction conditions that did not require transition metal catalysis, nor the exclusion of air or moisture, the reaction is suggested to involve exploiting the propensity of thioacetamide to undergo hydrolysis under basic conditions. This is follows by addition of the ensuing sulfide anion to the 1,3&#8208;alkynone and a nucleophilic aromatic substitution and denitrative rearomatization cascade to give the S&#8208;heterocyclic product in yields of 41&#8208;99%.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Pyridone ribo&#8208;C&#8208;Nucleosides via Heck Reaction and Oxidation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleosides find applications in medicinal chemistry, chemical biology and diagnostics. Among the nucleosides, C&#8209;nucleosides have attracted particular attention because their carbon&#8208;carbon bond between nucleobase and ribose provides stability against degradation. While several well&#8208;established methods exist for the synthesis of 2'&#8208;deoxy&#8208;C&#8208;nucleosides, the preparation of their ribofuranosyl counterparts is more challenging. Established methods for their synthesis give mixtures of anomers and require harsh reagents or conditions. Here we report a diastereoselective glycosylation method involving a Heck reaction between a glycal and an aryl iodide, followed by oxidation of the silyl enol ether with methyl(trifluoromethyl)dioxirane (TFDO). The resulting ketone is then diastereoselectively reduced to the ribonucleoside. The new route has been applied to pyridones and is expected to also yield other ribo&#8208;C&#8209;nucleosides in diastereoselective fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>Green Light&#8208;Responsive D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D Quinoxaline Emitters for Luminescent Solar Concentrators: Potential Integration in Agrivoltaic Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new family of quinoxaline&#8208;based dyes for the assembly of luminescent solar concentrators (LSC) with promising performances for applications in agrivoltaic technologies. These materials are transparent to the photosynthetically relevant green radiations, while strongly absorb other wavelengths with good emission in the red region of the visible spectrum.







Abstract
The integration of photovoltaic technologies within agricultural settings, also known as agrivoltaics, is attracting increasing attention as a sustainable approach to ensure both clean energy and food supply. The success of this strategy relies on the development of innovative materials that can selectively convert specific wavelengths into energy while being transparent to photosynthetically relevant light. To this aim, here we report our endeavors in the synthesis of a new class of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D quinoxaline fluorophores and their use in the preparation of wavelength&#8208;selective luminescent solar concentrators. The dyes were expeditiously prepared following a direct arylation protocol and extensively characterized by spectroscopic analyses and computational studies. They present high light harvesting ability in the green region of the visible spectrum and good emission properties, which were fully retained in the solid state when embedded into a poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) matrix. These materials were employed to construct LSC devices of promising efficiency, fostering further developments for the use of wavelength&#8208;selective LSC in agrivoltaic systems.

         <title>FeF3&#8208;Promoted Radical Fluoroalkylation of o&#8208;Alkenylaryl Isocyanides to Access 2&#8208;Fluoroalkylated Quinolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for preparing quinolines through iron(III)&#8208;promoted radical fluoroalkylation was developed. In the presence of FeF3 and Cs2CO3, a variety of o&#8208;alkenylaryl isocyanides smoothly underwent the radical fluoroalkylation with perfluoroalkyl iodides to afford biologically important 2&#8208;fluoroalkylated quinolines in 38&#8211;81&#8201;% yields. Moreover, the conditions are compatible with nonfluorinated alkyl iodides leading to 2&#8208;alkylated quinolines.







Abstract
An iron(III)&#8208;promoted radical fluoroalkylation of o&#8208;alkenylaryl isocyanides has been developed using readily available perfluoroalkyl iodides as fluoroalkyl source.

     alt="FeF3-Promoted Radical Fluoroalkylation of o-Alkenylaryl Isocyanides to Access 2-Fluoroalkylated Quinolines"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient method for preparing quinolines through iron(III)-promoted radical fluoroalkylation was developed. In the presence of FeF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, a variety of o-alkenylaryl isocyanides smoothly underwent the radical fluoroalkylation with perfluoroalkyl iodides to afford biologically important 2-fluoroalkylated quinolines in 38&#8211;81&#8201;% yields. Moreover, the conditions are compatible with nonfluorinated alkyl iodides leading to 2-alkylated quinolines.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Linear &#960;&#8208;Extension of Acridone by the Fusion of Cyclobutadienoid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalization of small aromatic heterocycles is a straight and efficient method to access large polycyclic conjugated molecules. However, due to its unique reactivity, the derivatization of acridone usually gives the product in the angular shape and is difficult to obtain the linear ones. Here we report the direct functionalization of acridone to generate its linearly fused derivatives containing cyclobutadienoid via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed arene&#8208;(oxa)norbornene annulation followed by the dehydrated aromatization. The experimental characterizations demonstrate that the antiaromatic cyclobutadienoid ring can extend the molecular conjugation. Theoretical calculations reveal the weakened aromaticity of neighboring benzenoid rings of cyclobutadienoid with no influence on the electronic structure of central pyridone. The molecular stability is enhanced in comparison to that of linear acridone derivatives containing only six&#8208;membered rings.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Trifluoromethylated Ketones by Photocatalyzed Deoxygenative Coupling of Aromatic Acids with &#945;&#8208;CF3 Substituted Styrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl alkenes are versatile CF3&#8208;containing feedstocks. They have been widely used to construct gem&#8208;difluoroalkene scaffolds via &#946;&#8208;F elimination. The application of &#945;&#8208;CF3 alkenes as trifluoromethylating reagents has been less explored. In this paper, we report an efficient route for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylated ketones from easily&#8208;accessed &#945;&#8208;CF3 styrenes and aromatic carboxylic acids under photoredox catalysis. The reactions proceed through phosphoranyl radical&#8208;promoted deoxygenation of aromatic acids, generating acyl radicals for subsequent hydroacylation of &#945;&#8208;CF3 styrenes. The valuable trifluoromethyl&#8208;containing compounds could be produced in good yields under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Indirect and Regioselective Phosphonation of Azobenzenes: Toward the Design of Water&#8208;Soluble Photoswitches</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H acyloxylation of azobenzenes enabling the regioselective introduction of the double&#8208;functionalized phophonoacetate motif was developed. The method proved tolerant for a wide range of substituents. Chemoselective hydrolysis of the diethylphosphonate function leads to a water&#8208;soluble azobenzene with interesting photophysical properties, holding great promise for the design of water&#8208;soluble photochemical tools for future biological applications.







Abstract
An efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed ortho C&#8722;H acyloxylation of azobenzenes, allowing the introduction of the difunctionalised substituent, diethylphosphonoacetate, is reported. Thanks to the mild reaction conditions implemented, this regioselective late&#8208;stage ortho&#8208;functionalization tolerates a wide range of functional groups and permits the access of diversely substituted azobenzenes in good to excellent yields. Selective hydrolysis of the diethyl phosphonate group leads to stable water&#8208;soluble azo&#8208;photoswitches with interesting photophysical properties such as an extended Z&#8208;isomer half&#8208;life, opening new opportunities in the design of optochemical tools for the exploration of living organisms.

         <title>New Strategies to Improve the Efficiency of Curcumin&#8208;Based Iridium Complexes for OLED Devices</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among the solid&#8208;state lighting technologies, OLEDs occupy a prominent position for the high efficiencies associated with the low CO2 emissions. In line with the recent studies aimed at designing sustainable and biodegradable devices, herein we report on the synthesis of a series of iridium(III) complexes featuring, as &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands, curcumin and 6&#8208;dehydrogingerdione, two natural compounds found in the rhizome of Curcuma longa and Zingiber officinale. To improve the solubility of both the ligands and prevent the aggregation of the complexes, oleoyl residues were inserted on the phenolic &#8208;OH groups. The resulting complexes exhibited a green emission with quantum yields as high as 2.8% (relative to fluorescein). OLED devices were fabricated by using, as emitting layer, a host&#8208;guest blend of the iridium complex in 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bis(N&#8208;carbazolyl)&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenyl (CBP). The morphological analysis revealed that thin films of the emitting layer were homogeneous. The devices fabricated with iridium complexes from 6&#8208;dehydrogingerdione exhibited higher luminance, efficiency and power efficiency with respect to the corresponding devices obtained from curcumin; also the functionalization of the &#946;&#8208;diketone unit with the oleoyl residue proved to increase significantly the performance of the device. Overall, these data suggest that aggregation is a key factor that compromise the performances of the corresponding OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Kanamycin&#8208;Cu(II) Complex Catalyzed Ullmann Amine Synthesis at Room Temperature: A Tool for Mechanistic Insights into Methylene Blue Degradation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study highlights the significance of Ullmann coupling reaction in modern organic synthesis and advances catalytic methodologies through the introduction of a kanamycin&#8208;copper complex as a highly efficient catalyst for the synthesis of diverse N&#8208;Aryl compounds. We demonstrate the catalyst's versatility through the synthesis of 20 Daryl&#8208;amine instances, 21 Ar(het)&#8208;N compounds, and 10 miscellaneous examples. NMR, IR, and UV spectroscopy offers insights into the catalyst's behaviour. Additionally, DFT studies support the catalyst's proficiency in generating SO4 radicals by stabilizing with aminosugars moieties. Ex&#8208;situ NMR experiments confirm a ternary complex&#8208;based mechanism at concentrations below 0.1&#956;M. Furthermore, we showcase the degradation of methylene blue to its precursor amine under optimized conditions. Overall, this research underscores the potential of Ullmann condensation reactions in contemporary organic synthesis and contributes significantly to the advancement of catalytic methodologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Bisspiro(oxindole)s by DMAP&#8208;Catalyzed [3 + 2] Annulation of Isatin&#8208;Derived Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman Carbonates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents a straightforward [3 + 2] annulation method for synthesizing bisspiro(oxindole) derivatives using isatin&#8208;derived Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates and p&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) with 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as the catalyst. The optimized protocol in dichloromethane (DCM) solvent achieves good yields (up to 87%) and diastereoselectivity (&gt;20:1). The method's versatility is shown through the synthesis of various derivatives, including chiral variants with up to 82% ee. The intermediates were captured by HRMS, and a plausible reaction pathway was proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Promoted Oxidative Amidation of Imines: A Facile Route to Amides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for preparing amides by imines oxidation is developed using aldehydes and amines as raw materials. Using copper oxide as catalyst and Oxone as oxidant without any coupling reagents, the reaction conditions are mild. A wide substrate range including pesticide and drug molecules has been demonstrated in 32&#8211;90&#8201;% yields.







Abstract
Herein, an environmentally friendly and efficient amidation method of imines by Oxone and CuO has been developed. This facile method shows excellent selectivity without affecting other functional groups such as phenyls, halogens, cyans, esters or heterocycles. This method features a broad substrate scope, mild conditions and high yields (&#8804;90&#8201;%), and the yield in the gram scale experiment also reaches up to 81&#8201;%. Flonicamid, moclobemide and bupivacaine are also successfully synthesized to demonstrate its potential utilities.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multicomponent Kr&#246;hnke reaction of chalcones with 1&#8208;(3,3,3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxopropyl)pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium bromide and ammonium acetate is described. This strategy allows efficiently construction of a series of 2&#8208;trifluoromethyl pyridines with broad functional groups.







Abstract
A multicomponent Kr&#246;hnke reaction route toward 2&#8208;trifluoromethyl pyridines from reaction of chalcones with easily available and stable 1&#8208;(3,3,3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxopropyl)pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium bromide and ammonium acetate is reported. The reaction is found to be general with a range of substituted chalcones, and the applicability of the methodology in gram scale is demonstrated. Preliminary results suggest that this transformation is initiated by 1,4&#8208;Michael addition, followed by inter&#8208; and intramolecular nucleophilic addition, and elimination.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Reactions of Alkenes with C&#8722;C Bond Formation: Recent Developments</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkenes are highly valuable materials in organic synthesis, and their three&#8208;component reactions offer a promising method for C&#8722;C bond formation and carbon chain elongation. This approach not only reduces the number of reaction steps but also minimizes waste generation, enabling the preparation of polysubstituted alkanes from simple starting materials. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advancements in this field from 2013 to 2023.

This approach not only reduces the number of reaction steps but also minimizes waste generation, enabling the preparation of polysubstituted alkanes from simple starting materials. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advancements in this field from 2013 to 2023. We have classified the developments into three main categories: (1) reactions triggered by C&#8208;radicals or heteroatom&#8208;radicals; (2) cascades involving three&#8208;membered ring intermediates; and (3) transformations catalyzed by metals. We will discuss a wide range of reactions that involve diazoium salts, arylhydrazines, acids, aldehydes, 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls, diazo compounds, amines, malononitriles, diacyl peroxides, ethers, 1,3&#8208;dithiane, arenes, CuSCF3, selectfluor, Et3N&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3HF, TBHP, CH2Cl2, CHCl3, CO2, CO, KCl, H2O, and other reagents. These reactions lead to alkylation, arylation, or carbonylation products. We believe that this review will be helpful for future research in this area.

         <title>Atropisomeric Properties of 5N&#8208;Benzoyl&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzodiazepin&#8208;2&#8208;ones: Substituent Effects on Rotation around the Ar&#8722;N(CO) Axis</title>

         <dc:description>
Atropisomeric properties of 5N&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzodiazepin&#8208;2&#8208;one with two Ar&#8722;N(CO) axes moving like gears were investigated. The rotational barrier (&#916;G&#8800;) of the axes was strongly influenced by the electronic effect of the p&#8208;substituent on benzoyl, and the electron&#8208;withdrawing group (EWG) increased the stability of the axes. The &#916;G&#8800; values were linearly correlated with the electronic effect (the Hammett &#963; constants) of functional groups.







Abstract
5N&#8208;Benzoyl&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzodiazepin&#8208;2&#8208;ones with various substituents were synthesized and their atropisomeric properties were analyzed. For the rotational isomers (E/Z) based on the amide bond [N&#8722;C(=O)], the E&#8208;isomers were preferentially formed regardless of the substituents. Atropisomers (aR/aS) due to the Ar&#8722;N(CO) (sp2&#8208;sp2) axis were isolated using chiral HPLC, and the rotational barrier (&#916;G&#8800;) in thermal isomerization was measured. The rotation barrier about the Ar&#8722;N(CO) axis was affected by both the substituents at the C6&#8208;position and the p&#8208;substituents on the benzoyl group. The substituents at C6 (R1) caused both steric and electronic effects. On the other hand, the p&#8208;substituents (R2) on the benzoyl group caused electronic effects: the electron&#8208;donating group (EDG) lowered the &#916;G&#8800; value, whereas the electron&#8208;withdrawing group (EWG) raised it. The &#916;G&#8800; values were linearly correlated with the magnitude of the electronic effect (Hammett &#963; constants) of functional groups (R2). The EDG causes an increase in the electron density on the carbonyl moiety in the amide, which may disturb the planarity of the amide bond, resulting in a decrease in the &#916;G&#8800; value.

         <title>Fluoroalkoxylating Reagents in Organic Synthesis: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advancement in the development of fluoroalkoxylating (ORf) reagents for the preparation of prestigious ORf&#8208;containing compounds is described in this review.







Abstract
The fluoroalkoxy groups (ORf) are widely used motifs in pharmaceutical and agrochemical fields due to their unique physicochemical properties including higher lipophilicity and increased metabolic stability. Thus, the high value of ORf&#8208;containing derivatives has stimulated the development of fluoroalkoxylation reactions. In this review, we highlight the recent progress of various trifluoroalkoxylating reagents and their applications in organic synthesis in the past five years.

         <title>Trifluoromethoxylation of Arynes using 2,4&#8208;Dinitro&#8208;1&#8208;(trifluoromethoxybenzene) as Trifluoromethoxide Anion Source</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The trifluoromethoxy moiety, an emerging fluorinated group, shows interesting properties for pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications. However, only few methods have been reported for the direct introduction of this group on molecules with high efficiency, safety and low cost. Indeed, most of direct trifluoromethoxylation reagents are either expensive, hazardous or require preliminary synthesis before their use. Here we describe the use of 2,4&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1&#8208;(trifluoromethoxy)benzene (DNTFB) as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, safe, commercially available and cheap source of trifluoromethoxide anion for the trifluoromethoxylation of arynes.</dc:description>

         <title>Selenoureido Calix[6]arenes: A Novel Platform for Pseudorotaxane Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroditopic calix[6]arenes are widely employed macrocycles for the synthesis of pseudo&#8208;oriented interlocked systems and stimuli&#8208;induced molecular machines, among others. Herein, we introduce a new calix[6]arene receptor functionalised with three phenylselenoureido groups. These hydrogen&#8208;bonding donor moieties are able to promote the threading of viologen&#8208;based organic axles inside the macrocyclic cavity to form a stable pseudorotaxane species. Preliminary investigations using 1H&#8208;NMR measurements and semi&#8208;empirical and DFT studies suggested its further use as a platform for the synthesis of rotaxanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Daphnicyclidin Alkaloids 2001&#8211;2023</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article provides a chronological overview of the 23 structurally diverse daphnicyclidin alkaloids isolated to date and highlights the various synthesis contributions that have been published to date on this unique group of alkaloids.







Abstract
The Daphniphyllum alkaloids represent a particularly diverse class of complex diterpene alkaloids, which are characterized by their enormous structural diversity. The daphnicyclidins, a subgroup of these alkaloids, stand out due to their unique pentafulvene structural motif. This review article gives an overview of the compounds that have been isolated so far and can be assigned to this subgroup. Furthermore, all synthesis approaches and total syntheses published to date are presented.

         <title>Synthesis and Application of Well&#8208;Defined Fluoroalkyl Zinc Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reviewed the preparation and application of these zinc fluoroalkyl complexes, with a focus on recently reported reactions with potential synthetic interest. From the perspective of reaction mechanism, the transfer of trifluoromethyl from zinc complexes to copper catalysts formed the highly active trifluoromethyl copper reagents, which can be directly used for the fluoroalkylation.







Abstract
Fluoroalkyl groups play an irreplaceable role in the field of pharmaceutical and agrochemical industry due to their unique properties. Based on this, it is crucial to effectively introduce fluoroalkyl groups into target molecules. In this review, we describe the synthesis of well&#8208;defined fluoroalkyl zinc complexes and their applications in the fluoroalkylation of compounds. Different from the reactivities of copper fluoroalkyl complexes, fluoroalkyl zinc complexes often needed to be combined with copper or nickel catalysts when participating in fluoroalkylation reactions. From the perspective of reaction mechanism, the transfer of trifluoromethyl from zinc complexes to copper catalysts formed the highly active trifluoromethyl copper reagents, which can be directly used for the fluoroalkylation. In most cases, the desired target products were provided with excellent yields.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Tabernanthine and Ibogaline: Rapid Access to Nosyl Tryptamines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total syntheses of tabernanthine and ibogaline were enabled by application of a thermal coupling of nosyl aziridine and indoles in eight steps each, 10 and 14&#8201;% yield respectively. A Friedel&#8208;Crafts type macrocyclization facilitated key C&#8722;C bond formation. Regio&#8208; and diastereoselective hydroboration&#8208;oxidation of the resultant macrocyclic alkene enabled C&#8722;N bond formation and furnished the completed isoquinuclidine ring system.







Abstract
We describe the first total syntheses of tabernanthine and ibogaline. Entry to these iboga alkaloid natural products is enabled by a thermal coupling of indoles and aziridines to furnish the requisite nosyl tryptamine starting materials. This route features a Friedel&#8208;Crafts type alkylation to form the key indole&#8208;isoquinuclidine C&#8722;C bond. Finally, a regio&#8208; and diastereoselective hydroboration&#8208;oxidation enables C&#8722;N bond formation to close the isoquinuclidine ring system and deliver tabernanthine and ibogaline in 10 and 14&#8201;% yield respectively. Both syntheses were completed in eight steps.

Finally, a regio- and diastereoselective hydroboration-oxidation enables C&#8722;N bond formation to close the isoquinuclidine ring system and deliver tabernanthine and ibogaline in 10 and 14&#8201;% yield respectively. Both syntheses were completed in eight steps.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Decatungstate Catalyzed Benzylic C&#8722;H Trifluoromethylthiolation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a decatungstate catalyzed trifluoromethylthiolation of the benzylic C&#8722;H bond. The reaction features mild conditions and good functional group tolerance, generating corresponding products in moderate to good yields with a slight excess of benzylic substrates or as limiting reagents.







Abstract
Here we report a mild protocol for benzylic C&#8722;H trifluoromethylthiolation using sodium decatungstate (NaDT) as the photocatalyst. Wherein, photoactivated DT abstracted the benzylic hydrogen atom via a radical process. This transformation works well with a slight excess of benzylic substrates or as limiting reagents for better purification. The reaction shows mild conditions and good functional group tolerance. Moreover, the protocol could be applied to gram&#8208;scale synthesis.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Formal [4+2] Cycloaddition of Ethynylethylene Carbonates for the Construction of 3,4&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[b][1,4]oxazines</title>

         <dc:description>
A formal [4+2] cycloaddition reaction of ethynylethylene carbonates and 2&#8208;aminophenols has been developed successfully for the synthesis of a series of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[b][1,4]oxazine derivatives.







Abstract
A formal [4+2] cycloaddition reaction of ethynylethylene carbonates and 2&#8208;aminophenols has been developed for the synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[b][1,4]oxazines bearing quaternary carbon atoms. The reaction features mild reaction conditions, good functional group compatibility and good yields. Furthermore, when using chiral PyBox ligand, this strategy could also achieve the asymmetric synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[b][1,4]oxazines. Application studies indicated that the hydroxymethyl group of final products was an excellent functional group that can be further modified easily.

         <title>Synthesis of Sulfo(xo)nium Diacylmethylides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfo(xo)nium diacylmethylides as stable and readily prepared sulfur ylides are versatile synthons. This concept article summarizes their synthetic methods, including the condensation of active methylene compounds with sulfides/sulfoxides, transylidations of diazo compounds and iodonium ylides with sulfides/sulfoxides, acylation of sulfo(xo)nium monoacylmethylides, and the reaction of electron&#8208;deficient alkynes and sulfoxides. Their substrate scopes, proposed mechanisms, selected product examples, limitations, and applications are discussed.







Abstract
Sulfo(xo)nium diacylmethylides (sulfur ylides) are simple, stable, readily prepared, and versatile synthons. Compared with the sulfo(xo)nium monoacylmethylides, they can be compatible with more rigorous reaction conditions and showcase unique characteristics due to their excellent stability. This concept article provides an account for the syntheses of sulfo(xo)nium diacylmethylides, including the utilization of active methylene compounds, carbene precursors, sulfo(xo)nium monoacylmethylides, and electron&#8208;deficient alkynes as substrates, with discussions on substrate scopes, proposed mechanisms, selected product examples, and applications. Challenges for further exploration and prospect on sulfo(xo)nium diacylmethylides in the future are also suggested.

         <title>Direct Introduction of an Acetyl Group at the &#945;&#8208;Carbon Atom of an Arene Ring through an Amide Photo&#8208;Fries Rearrangement upon Exposure to UV Light</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;Fries rearrangement using benzoheterocyclic compounds, which are widely used in pharmaceuticals, was studied. Under ultraviolet (UV) light, benzoheterocyclic compounds containing an N&#8208;acetyl group underwent rearrangement of the acyl group directly to the &#945;&#8208;position past the adjacent bridgehead carbon. This environmentally friendly method could be useful in organic synthesis, the pharmaceutical industry, and biochemistry.







Abstract
We employed an amide photo&#8208;Fries rearrangement for the synthesis benzoheterocyclic compounds and found that direct acylation of the &#945;&#8208;carbon atom in an arene ring can occur upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. In this reaction, the N&#8208;acetyl group of amides underwent rearrangement to the &#945;&#8208;position across the bridgehead carbon atom under UV&#8722;C light. The reaction conditions were gentle and safe. Moreover, this reaction proves to be more convenient for selectively manipulating benzoheterocyclic compounds in comparison to traditional approaches involving Lewis acid catalysts or anionic reagents.

         <title>Electrochemical Decarboxylative Addition of N&#8208;Aryl Glycines to Enaminones: Access to C3&#8208;Aminomethyl Chromones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical decarboxylative addition of N&#8208;substituted glycines to enaminones has been developed for the synthesis of C3&#8208;aminomethyl chromones. The products could be generated under oxidant&#8208;, catalyst&#8208;, and light&#8208;free conditions at room temperature, and could act as valuable building blocks to construct polysubstituted pyrimidines with potential bioactivities.







Abstract
An electrochemical decarboxylative addition of N&#8208;substituted glycines to enaminones has been developed and conducted under oxidant&#8208;, catalyst&#8208;, and light&#8208;free conditions in acetonitrile at room temperature by using electron as the traceless oxidant, which provided a green approach to C3&#8208;aminomethyl chromones. The resulting products were formed through radical addition/oxidation/cyclization or electrophilic addition/cyclization pathway and could act as valuable building blocks to construct polysubstituted pyrimidine derivatives.

&lt;p&gt;An electrochemical decarboxylative addition of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-substituted glycines to enaminones has been developed for the synthesis of C3-aminomethyl chromones. The products could be generated under oxidant-, catalyst-, and light-free conditions at room temperature, and could act as valuable building blocks to construct polysubstituted pyrimidines with potential bioactivities.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An electrochemical decarboxylative addition of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-substituted glycines to enaminones has been developed and conducted under oxidant-, catalyst-, and light-free conditions in acetonitrile at room temperature by using electron as the traceless oxidant, which provided a green approach to C3-aminomethyl chromones. The resulting products were formed through radical addition/oxidation/cyclization or electrophilic addition/cyclization pathway and could act as valuable building blocks to construct polysubstituted pyrimidine derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Electrooxidative Annulation of Naphthol with Acrylate via C&#8722;H Bond Activation for the Synthesis of Naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]furan</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have sythesized naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]furan derivatives using iridium catalyzed electrochemical coupling of naphthol and acrylates. Ir&#8208;catalyzed oxidant&#8208;free electrochemical C&#8722;H annulation is achieved by electrooxidative C&#8722;H acrylation via weak O&#8208;coordination. This method does not require additives and external chemical oxidants in the syntheses of naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]furans.







Abstract
Iridium catalyzed electrochemical coupling of naphthols with acrylates for the syntheses of naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]furan derivatives are herein reported. Ir&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical C&#8722;H annulation is accomplished within a supportive catalysis manifold, paving the way for electrooxidative C&#8722;H acrylation via weak O&#8208;coordination. The merge of iridium catalysts and electric current not only minimizes the need for a stoichiometric amount of chemical oxidants but also confirms broad reaction compatibility with a variety of electronically and sterically diverse substrates. This utility provides a valuable method for producing a wide range of naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]furan derivatives in good to moderate yields.

&lt;p&gt;We have sythesized naphtho[1,8-bc]furan derivatives using iridium catalyzed electrochemical coupling of naphthol and acrylates. Ir-catalyzed oxidant-free electrochemical C&#8722;H annulation is achieved by electrooxidative C&#8722;H acrylation via weak O-coordination. This method does not require additives and external chemical oxidants in the syntheses of naphtho[1,8-bc]furans.
