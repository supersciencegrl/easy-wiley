         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Steroidal Products: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 5, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article summarizes the recent breakthroughs in chemoenzymatic synthesis of steroidal products. Integrating steroid hydroxylase, reductase, or dehydrogenase to produce regio&#8208; and stereoselective catalysis, enabling the synthetic route more concise, effective and environment&#8208;friendly.







Abstract
The synthesis of steroidal products has garnered sustained interest due to their versatile bioactivities and physicochemical properties in pharmaceutics. However, the complicated structure of steroids, especially their highly oxygenated skeleton, has presented significant challenges. Benefitted from recent advancements in bioinformatics, genetics, and enzyme engineering, chemoenzymatic strategy combines the flexibility of chemical synthesis with the high regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity of biocatalysis, being an effective approach for the concise synthesis of natural products. In this concept, we review and discuss the recent advances in chemoenzymatic approaches for efficient synthesis of steroids and their analogs, as well as future research opportunities and challenges.

         <title>New Isoxazole&#8208;Substituted Aryl Iodides: Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis, Characterization and Catalytic Activity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 5, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
New Isoxazole bearing aryl iodides 1&#8201;a&#8211;1&#8201;d were synthesized via metal&#8208;free [3+2] cycloaddition and their catalytic activity was investigated towards oxidation of hydroquinone, sulfides and &#945;&#8208;oxytosylation of acetophenones.







Abstract
A series of new isoxazole&#8208;substituted aryl iodides 1&#8201;a&#8211;1&#8201;d have been synthesized by DIB&#8208;mediated [3+2] cycloaddition reaction of 2&#8208;iodo&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(prop&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;yloxy) benzene (4) with corresponding benzaldehyde oximes 5&#8201;a&#8211;5&#8201;d. Structure of the synthesized aryl iodides 1 were characterized by IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HRMS. The structure of 1&#8201;a was also confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. Further, catalytic activity of iodoarenes 1&#8201;a&#8211;1&#8201;d was screened for the oxidation of hydroquinones and sulfides. On oxidation using aryl iodides 1 with m&#8208;CPBA as terminal oxidant, hydroquinones afforded benzoquinones while sulfides gave corresponding sulfoxides in good to excellent yields. Iodoarene 1&#8201;b showed the best catalytic activity for the oxidation of sulfides and hydroquinones. Moreover, iodoarene 1&#8201;b, was also utilized for &#945;&#8208;oxytosylation of acetophenones.

         <title>Vinylene Carbonate as Latent Formylmethyl Surrogate: The Expediency of Ruthenium(II) Catalysis in Accessing Arylacetaldehydes, Arylacetates and Acetals</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 5, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed additive controlled direct formylmethylation and sequential dehydrogenative esterification of phthalazinones to access arylacetaldehydes, arylacetates, and acetals using vinylene carbonate as a C2 synthon. The reaction mechanism is elucidated using various control experiments and confirmation of possible intermediates by mass spectrometry.







Abstract
Arylacetaldehydes and its corresponding esters are fundamental structural motifs widespread in natural products and pharmaceuticals. Herein, we developed a ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed direct formylmethylation and sequential dehydrogenative esterification of phthalazinones by adopting vinylene carbonate as a C2 synthon (formylmethyl equivalent). The reaction is compatible with a repertoire of substrates bearing both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents. Strikingly, the products obtained are governed by the additive used. A number of control experiments are conducted to elucidate the reaction mechanism. Furthermore, an important highlight is confirmation of possible intermediates by mass spectrometry.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 5, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple protocol with thienannulation at the last step has been developed for the synthesis of aryl&#8208;bridged thienonaphthalimides. This unusual approach has significant advantages, namely, thiophene precursors and organolithium reagents are not used to assemble the &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. It was found that the aryl&#8208;bridged thienonaphthalimides are ambipolar organic semiconductors.







Abstract
Three small molecules consisting of thieno&#8208;fused naphthalimide units connected via aromatic linkers were synthesized to study the effect of fused thiophene rings on the properties of naphthalimide&#8208;based molecules. A protocol for the synthesis of thienonaphthalimide&#8208;based molecules without prior preparation and use of thienonaphthalimide precursors and organoelement compounds (organolithium, organotin, or organoboron compounds) was developed. The protocol is based on double thienannulation of bis&#8208;alkyne substrates with sodium sulfide. The thin&#8208;film morphology, photophysical and electrochemical properties of the obtained small molecules were studied. Single&#8208;layer non&#8208;doped organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on fluorene&#8208;bridged thienonaphthalimide dimer showed yellow emission with luminance of 2200&#8197;cd/m2, and current efficiency of 0.35&#8197;cd/A. Combination of transient electroluminescence and photo&#8208;CELIV methods allowed to estimate electron and hole mobility in the synthesized compounds; both are in order of 10&#8722;6&#8197;cm2V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.

         <title>Synthesis of 13&#8211;16&#8208;Membered Cyclotetrapeptide Mimics by Ugi Reactions with Diacids and Diisonitriles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 5, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical libraries of 13&#8211;16&#8208;membered cyclic tetraamides were conveniently and quickly synthesized by multi&#8208;component Ugi reactions. The conformations of some cyclic tetraamides were studied by X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR experiments.







Abstract
13&#8211;16&#8208;Membered cyclic tetraamides were synthesized by Ugi reactions using diisonitriles and dicarboxylic acids in 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol without (pseudo) high dilution conditions. Structures of these cyclic tetraamides were investigated by NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallography.

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis and Photophysical Properties of 2,7&#8208;Functionalized 1,3,6,8&#8208;Tetraethynylpyrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 5, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioselectively multi&#8208;functionalized pyrenes were synthesized through one&#8208;pot reactions, with Stille and Suzuki coupling reactions involved in the sequence. More importantly, the 1,2,3,6,7,8&#8208;hexaphenylethynylpyrene was first obtained through this strategy.







Abstract
We report a facile synthesis of regioselectively multi&#8208;functionalized pyrenes through one&#8208;pot reactions. These reactions involve Stille and Suzuki coupling reactions, which are proven effective in forming 1,2,3,6,7,8&#8208;hexaphenylethynylpyrene for the first time. The 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetraphenylethynyl pyrenediboronates are essential in synthesizing multi&#8208;functionalized pyrenes, and the results indicate that the Stille coupling reaction is more effective than the Sonogashira coupling reaction in forming these boronate compounds in good yields. Furthermore, the experimental and theoretical investigations into the photophysical and electrochemical properties of the obtained 1,2,3,6,7,8&#8208;multifunctionalized pyrenes show that the phenylethynyl groups at 2,7&#8208;positions further increase the system conjugation, which is significant in developing new materials with enhanced properties.

         <title>Indium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Three Component Reaction of N&#8208;Bromosuccinimide, Alkenes and N&#8208;Tosylhydrazones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 5, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;component reaction of alkenes, N&#8208;sulfonylhydrazones and N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS) for synthesis of bromoethyl sulfonyl hydrazones is disclosed, in which 28&#8197;products were synthesized in low to high yields. In addition, the reaction proceeded well at room temperature under air, because of using indium triflate as an environmentally friendly Lewis acid catalyst.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component reaction involving alkenes, N&#8208;sulfonylhydrazones, and N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS) is described that uses Indium(III) triflate for the synthesis of bromoethyl sulfonyl hydrazones. Using N&#8208;tosylhydrazones as a nitrogen source and NBS as a bromine source, this intermolecular aminobromination of alkenes is carried out under air in mild conditions. A mechanism of electrophilic addition is proposed based on the GC&#8208;MS analytical result.

Abstract
Three new sesquiterpene&#8208;hydroquinone hybrids, saromacrophorins A&#8211;C (1&#8211;3) were isolated from the deep&#8208;sea&#8208;derived fungus Sarocladium terricola 494a, along with nine known compounds. Their structures were elucidated by comprehensive analyses of 1D and 2D NMR, HRESIMS, and ECD calculations. Noteworthily, compound 1 is a rare 5&#8242;,6&#8242;&#8208;dihydroxymacrophorin and compound 3 is the first example of macrophorin possessing 4&#8242;S&#8208;configuration. Compound 4 showed potent anti&#8208;food allergic activity with an IC50 value of 18.9&#8197;&#956;M.

         <title>Facile (3+2) Cycloaddition between an N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefin and Nitrous Oxide at Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 5, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The N2O activation by a gem&#8208;dimethyl substituted N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin occurs under mild conditions and yields an imidazolone and a diazoalkane. The reaction proceeds via a sequence of rate&#8208;determining (3+2) cycloaddition followed by cycloreversion. This finding is substantiated by kinetic investigations and DFT computations of the potential energy surface together with frontier molecular orbital analysis.







Abstract
We report that a gem&#8208;dimethylated N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO) reacts with N2O at ambient pressure and room temperature to give an imidazolone and an azine formed from intermediately generated 2&#8208;diazopropane. The in&#8197;situ formation of transient diazopropane was indirectly proven by its engagement in a facile cycloaddition with norbornene. According to our studies, the reaction sequence consists of a rate&#8208;determining (3+2) cycloaddition between the NHO and N2O, followed by a cycloreversion that releases the diazoalkane. This mechanistic proposal is supported by DFT calculations. Eyring analysis using temperature&#8208;variable 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy allowed us to determine the activation parameters of the initial (3+2) cycloaddition (&#916;&#8800;H=11.2(4)&#8197;kcal/mol, &#916;&#8800;S=&#8722;39.8(13) e.u., 293&#8211;308&#8197;K). Frontier molecular orbital analysis shows that the polarization of the &#960;&#8208;bond of the NHO decisively facilitates the cycloaddition.

Abstract
An efficient method for the construction of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonylindoles and 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonylindoles using solid calcium carbide as an alkyne source and o&#8208;sulfonamidobenzaldehyde hydrazones or o&#8208;sulfonamidoacetophenone hydrazones as starting materials is described. This protocol has the salient feature of the use of an inexpensive, abundant and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle solid alkyne source, effectively avoiding the use of flammable and explosive gaseous acetylene as an original alkyne source. Noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, wide substrate scope, high yield, and simple workup procedures are advantages of this method. The transformation can also be carried out on a gram scale.

         <title>Synthesis of 2,5&#8208;Disubstituted Pyridines using the Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloisomerization of 1&#8208;Bromoalkynes as Key Step</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 5, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 4&#8208;step sequence for constructing pyridines from 1&#8208;bromoalkynes, readily available substrates from feedstock materials, has been developed. The versatility of this approach arises, on the one hand, from the variety of cyclopentenes affordable through the key gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization step and, on the other hand, from its modular nature that allows the introduction of an &#224; la carte substituent at position 2 employing a Suzuki coupling.







Abstract
Gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization reaction of 1&#8208;bromoalkynes allowed for the preparation of a variety of 1&#8208;bromocyclopentene derivatives. These have been used as substrates in a 3&#8208;step synthetic sequence comprising a cross&#8208;coupling reaction, followed by ozonolysis, and final condensation towards the corresponding 2,5&#8208;disubstituted pyridine. In addition, bicyclic fused pyridines are achieved, including the first total synthesis of the natural product Sinensine B.

The Front Cover illustrates the catalytic utilization of isoxazole&#8208;tethered aryl iodides. These aryl iodides have been synthesized through a [3+2] cycloaddition reaction under metal&#8208;free conditions. Oxidative transformations such as oxidation of hydroquinone, sulfides and, &#945;&#8208;oxytosylation were carried out using aryl iodides as catalyst and&#160;m&#8208;CPBA as terminal oxidant. The aryl iodides showed excellent catalytic activity towards these transformations. These isoxazole&#8208;tethered aryl iodides have been proved to be an efficient addition towards hypervalent iodine catalysis. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Kumar et&#8197;al.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Unnatural Tryptophans</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 5, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the extension of indolisation methods based on palladium calalyzed coupling reactions such as Heck reaction, Sonogashira coupling and Larock annulation towards the synthesis of unnatural tryptophan derivatives which are either used as IDO inhibitors or as probes for photophysical studies or important building blocks for preparation of indole based natural products.







Abstract
Unnatural tryptophans are introduced to explore and engineer the dynamics, function and properties of modified proteins because of intrinsic fluorescence decay, participation in various &#960;&#8208;system interactions, and high occurrences of tryptophan nucleolus in proteins. Due to its role in protein stability and utility as a fluorophore, it becomes a useful unit for protein studies. Several unnatural tryptophans including the oxygen and sulfur analogues have been constructed as endogenous tryptophan analogues to modify the fluorescent character with minimal perturbation to the native structure, while others have been synthesized to probe the cellular mechanisms of protein synthesis. A number of efficient methods for the construction of this important building block, including Larock indolisation, Heck coupling, Negishi coupling and Sonagashira coupling followed by cyclisation have been widely studied and patented as well, by different research groups. Surprisingly, there is a scarcity of any comprehensive reviews on palladium catalyzed synthesis of unnatural tryptophans. Therefore, we summarized the development of different palladium catalysts, ligands and synthetic approaches for the unnatural tryptophans from 2005 to the most recent results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review on the synthesis of unnatural tryptophans.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalysed Transfer Hydrogenation Reactions with Glycerol and Carbohydrates as Hydrogen Donors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysed transfer hydrogenation using non&#8208;toxic, low cost and renewable biomass as hydrogen donors represents a sustainable and promising approach for the reduction of organic compounds. In this context, glycerol and carbohydrates are attractive hydrogen donors. In this review, we explore various catalytic systems that have been reported for reducing various unsaturated compounds, as well as the advantages and challenges associated with biomass in transfer hydrogenation reactions.







Abstract
Catalytic transfer hydrogenation is a practical approach for reduction of various unsaturated compounds and an alternative to pressurised hydrogenation and traditional metal hydride reagents. Among the various hydrogen donors, biomass such as glycerol and carbohydrates received considerable attention for the reduction reactions due to their non&#8208;toxic, eco&#8208;friendly and renewable nature. The present review addresses the development of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts for the transfer hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds, alkenes, alkynes, nitro compounds, CO2 etc. using glycerol and carbohydrates as potential hydrogen donors.

         <title>A gem&#8208;Dibromocyclopropane Ring&#8208;Expansion/Mizoroki&#8208;Heck Cyclisation Route to Tetrahydrodibenzofurans</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Readily accessible and oxygenated 6,6&#8208;dibromobicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes undergo ring&#8208;opening/nucleophilic trapping reactions with isovanillin to afford adducts that can be engaged in intramolecular Mizoroki&#8208;Heck reactions to give tetrahydrodibenzofurans. Variations in the manner in which the first step of the reaction sequence is carried out can be used to alter the regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;chemical forms of both the intermediate and final products.







Abstract
Readily accessible, oxygenated 6,6&#8208;dibromobicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes react with isovanillin in the presence of silver salts and an inorganic base to afford ring&#8208;expanded/nucleophilic trapping products of various regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;chemical forms. Most such products undergo efficient, intramolecular Mizoroki&#8208;Heck reactions to give the corresponding tetrahydrodibenzofurans. In certain cases, simple variations in the first step of such reaction sequences enables the preparation distinct ring&#8208;expansion products that also cyclise to give tetrahydrodibenzofurans embodying alternative substitution patterns.

         <dc:description>The formation of C&#8722;N bonds is a vital technique in organic synthesis for creating nitrogen&#8208;containing motifs, which has extensive uses in agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and natural products. Significant progress has been made in constructing C&#8722;N bonds using transition metal catalysis. Nevertheless, utilizing alkyl substrates for the formation of Csp3&#8722;N bonds is a notable challenge. Synergistic photoredox and copper catalysis have proven to be a powerful tool to tackle this challenge. The development of this research domain is still in its early stages owing to the chemical and technical complexities of this catalytic process.

         <title>Asymmetric Organocatalyzed Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Aminophosphinates via Thiourea Anion&#8208;Binding Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P&#8208;Stereogenic &#945;&#8208;aminophosphinates were obtained in high enantioselectivity via anion&#8208;binding catalysis with thiourea catalysts, further expanding the range of nucleophiles that can be used in this type of catalysis.







Abstract
Thioureas catalyze the reaction of phosphonites with in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated isoquinolinium salts to give C and P&#8208;stereogenic &#945;&#8208;aminophosphinates in high enantioselectivity (up to 96&#8201;%) and yield (up to 95&#8201;%). Low diastereoselectivity was obtained and this is rationalized in the context of a mechanistic proposal involving anion&#8208;binding catalysis of the P&#8722;C bond formation step followed by uncatalyzed Arbuzov collapse. The scope of the reaction, including a g&#8208;scale example, was demonstrated.

         <title>Intramolecular Hydrogen Atom Transfer from Unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond to Alkyl Radical</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular HAT processes initiated by heteroatom&#8208;centered radicals, aryl radicals, and vinyl radicals, have already been well developed in the past century. In contrast, the development of alkyl radical&#8208;mediated HAT reactions lagged behind. This Concept highlights recent advance in regioselective functionalization of ubiquitous unactivated C&#8722;H bonds enabled by intramolecular H&#8208;atom transfer to alkyl radicals.







Abstract
Regioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization in atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic mode has long been recognized as a prominent and challenging task due to its application in late&#8208;stage modification of complex skeletons, natural products and drugs. As a complement to transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation and carbene/nitrene insertion reactions, hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) emerges as a versatile tool for C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization and showcases significant and distinctive superiority in terms of selectivity trend and substrate scope. Intramolecular HAT processes initiated by nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;centered radicals, aryl radicals, and vinyl radicals, have already been well developed in the past century. In contrast, the development of alkyl radical&#8208;mediated HAT reactions lagged behind, although generation methods of corresponding alkyl radicals under mild conditions have gained rapid growth. Especially, selective and efficient HAT from unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H to alkyl radical is highly challenging due to their comparable BDEs and radical polarity. This Concept highlights recent advance in regioselective functionalization of ubiquitous unactivated C&#8722;H bonds enabled by intramolecular H&#8208;atom transfer to alkyl radicals.

         <title>B(OH)3&#8208;Catalyzed Dual Friedel&#8208;Crafts Type Reaction of Anilines and Aldehydes to Access Di&#8208; or Triarylmethanes (TRAMs)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The B(OH)3&#8208;catalyzed dual Friedel&#8208;Crafts type reaction has been developed to install a tertiary Csp3&#8208;center. The efficacy of this process is explored towards the preparation of symmetric and unsymmetric tri&#8208;arylmethanes (TRAMs).







Abstract
The catalytic influences of boric acid have been introduced on dual Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction between arylamines and aldehydes to install the Csp3&#8208;center that leads to the formation of di&#8208; or tri&#8208;substituted methanes. The described reaction conditions have directed the transformation to favor the para&#8208;para substitution pattern to deliver the major products rather than the corresponding ortho&#8208;para functionalization process. The devised transformation was examined by DFT calculation, which shows the favorable activation energy of transition states (TS) for the generation of highly substituted molecular scaffolds. The method was applicable over diversely substituted aldehydes and arylamines to afford the final products in excellent yields (60&#8208;92&#8201;%) and selectivity. The proposed mechanism is supported by suitable control experiments, GC&#8208;MS studies, and DFT calculations.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of 3&#8208;Arylphthalides Promoted by Eaton's reagent</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convenient solvent and metal&#8208;free approach for the synthesis of a large variety of 3&#8208;arylphthalides from aromatic esters and aldehydes, combined with the antibacterial activity evaluation of selected analogues of natural phthalides against methicillin&#8208;resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).







Abstract
A rapid method has been developed for the synthesis of 3&#8208;arylphthalides from readily available starting materials. We describe herein a direct approach based on a simple Friedel&#8208;Crafts condensation between an aromatic ester and an aldehyde promoted by a mixture of phosphorus pentoxide and methanesulfonic acid (Eaton's reagent) under metal and solvent&#8208;free conditions. Due to their similarity to cytosporone E (a natural antibacterial phthalide), some of the synthesized compounds were tested as antibacterial agents against methicillin&#8208;resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus.

         <title>Successive &#946;&#8208;Glycosylations of Tiacumicinone: Formal Total Synthesis of Tiacumicin B and Access to a d&#8208;Mannoside Analog</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formal total synthesis of the antibiotic tiacumicin B is described as well as an analog with a d&#8208;mannose moiety in place of d&#8208;rhamnose. The challenging &#946;&#8208;selectivity of the key glycosylation steps has been achieved by using donors bearing a phenyl sulfoxide leaving group and a 3&#8208;O&#8208;picoloyl group that enables remote facial diastereocontrol via H&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated aglycone delivery.







Abstract
A formal total synthesis of the natural macrolide antibiotic tiacumicin B is described featuring successive and selective glycosylations of tiacumicinone. The challenging &#946;&#8208;facial selectivity of these key glycosylation steps was achieved by using noviosyl or rhamnosyl donors equipped with a phenyl sulfoxide leaving group and a 3&#8208;O&#8208;picoloyl group ensuring an efficient remote stereodirecting effect. Compared with our former total synthesis, this strategy enables us to save steps and gain access to new analogs. This was demonstrated by the replacement of the rhamnosidic moiety by a d&#8208;mannose derivative.

         <title>Synthesis and Photochemical Characterization of Indolizine Fluorophores Obtained by a Multicomponent Palladium Iodide&#8722;Catalyzed Oxidative Aminocarbonylation Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N,N&#8208;disubstituted 2&#8208;(indolizin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)acetamides with fluorescent properties are obtained in a multicomponent fashion starting from simple building blocks (2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pent&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;carbonyl compounds, CO, amines, and oxygen) through a sequential PdI2/KI&#8208;catalyzed oxidative aminocarbonylation &#8211; cyclization &#8211; aromatization process. Initially formed 2&#8208;ynamide intermediates, ensuing from Pd&#8208;catalyzed triple bond oxidative aminocarbonylation, are converted in&#8197;situ into the final products by amine&#8208;promoted intramolecular dearomative conjugate addition followed by rearomatization.







Abstract
A catalytic carbonylative method for the direct, multicomponent synthesis of indolizine fluorophores has been developed. The process is based on the PdI2/KI&#8208;catalyzed oxidative aminocarbonylation of 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pent&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;carbonyl compounds leading to the corresponding 2&#8208;ynamide intermediates, followed in&#8197;situ by 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization (by amine&#8208;promoted conjugate addition of the pyridine ring nitrogen) and aromatization, to give the finally isolated N,N&#8208;disubstituted 2&#8208;(indolizin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)acetamides. Reactions are carried out under relatively mild conditions (100&#8201;&#176;C under 20&#8197;atm of a 4&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture CO&#8722;air for 6&#8211;15&#8197;h) in MeCN as the solvent and with a low catalyst loading (0.33&#8197;mol% PdI2), in the presence of 0.5 equiv. of KI and 3 equiv. of a secondary amine. The optical properties of representative 2&#8208;(indolizin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)acetamide products have also been investigated.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-disubstituted 2-(indolizin-3-yl)acetamides with fluorescent properties are obtained in a multicomponent fashion starting from simple building blocks (2-(pyridin-2-yl)pent-4-yn-1-carbonyl compounds, CO, amines, and oxygen) through a sequential PdI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/KI-catalyzed oxidative aminocarbonylation &#8211; cyclization &#8211; aromatization process. Initially formed 2-ynamide intermediates, ensuing from Pd-catalyzed triple bond oxidative aminocarbonylation, are converted in&#8197;situ into the final products by amine-promoted intramolecular dearomative conjugate addition followed by rearomatization.

         <title>Chemical Strategies for the Cleavage of the C(sp3)&#8722;F Bonds in Perfluoroalkyl Groups</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent environmental pollutants. In this work, we summarized recent progress on the chemical defluorination of PFAS via cleavage of unactivated C&#8722;F bonds in longer perfluoroalkyl groups under mild conditions (~150&#8201;&#176;C). In addition to classic reductive defluorination, the strategies featuring Lewis acidic activation and transient generation of an unsaturated bond are described.







Abstract
Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been recognized as environmental pollutants. Hence, their efficient and mild destruction is a significant research interest. While many research articles and review papers have reported the cleavage of the C(sp2)&#8722;F bonds, single C(sp3)&#8722;F bond, and CF3 groups in PFAS, in this study, limited and emerging examples of a longer&#160;perfluoroalkyl group containing at least one repeating unit of 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethylene was focused. In this&#160;Concept, we summarized recent progress on the chemical defluorination of PFAS via the cleavage of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;F bonds in longer perfluoroalkyl groups under mild conditions (~150&#8201;&#176;C). In addition to classical reductive defluorination, strategies featuring Lewis acid activation and the transient generation of an unsaturated bond were described.

         <title>Investigation into a Tetrahydroquinazoline Scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quinazoline derivatives with four points of diversification were prepared from &#946;&#8208;oxoesters obtained from ethyl acrylate and a nitroalkane. It was condensed with amidinium chlorides and further elaborated with primary amines (X=NH) or aryl mercaptans (X=S) and carboxylic acids RD&#8722;CO2H.







Abstract
A new 5,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydroquinazoline (i.&#8201;e. 1,3&#8208;diazanaphthalene) scaffold with four points of diversification RA&#8722;RD was prepared. The sequence started from nitroalkanes RCCH2NO2 (with RC = Me, Bu), ethyl acrylate and amidines RAC(NH)NH2 (with RA = Ph, 4&#8208;pyridyl) which were converted in a conjugate addition, Dieckmann condensation and pyrimidine ring formation. After transformation of the OH group in 4&#8208;position to a chloro leaving group, residues RB were introduced by nucleophilic substitution with alkyl amines RBNH2 (10 examples) or aryl thiols RBSH (two examples). Finally, the nitro group in the 6&#8208;position was reduced and the primary amino function amidated with various carboxylic acids RDCO2H. Along this seven&#8208;step sequence, eight examples of the fully decorated scaffold were prepared.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical recycling polymer waste is a highly required technology to follow the current carbon&#8208;neutral trend. Here, we present practical recycling methods for poly (bisphenol A carbonate) (PC) and poly(&#1297;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL). PC can be converted to bisphenol A and urea with excellent product yield at 80 oC via ammonolysis using ammonium salt (ammonium&#8208;formate or &#8208;carbonate) instead of liquid ammonia that is usually used in previous PC recycling. PCL can be converted to methyl 6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;hexanoate monomer with excellent yield at 80 oC via methanolysis catalyzed by KOH.</dc:description>

         <title>Rose&#8208;Bengal&#8208;Photocatalyzed Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling Reactions under Visible Light</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The visible&#8208;light induced cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reactions have made tremendous developments in the last few years. This review focuses on the recent advances in rose bengal photocatalyzed CDC reactions to create carbon&#8208;carbon/carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond under visible light to synthesize various important organic molecules.







Abstract
Over the past few years, organic chemistry has used the organic dye rose bengal&#8216;s ability to absorb visible light. In present&#8208;day research, the innovation of environmentally friendly processes for carbon&#8208;carbon/carbon&#8208;heteroatoms (Nitrogen, Oxygen, Sulphur, and Phosphorus) bond formation has great importance. The photocatalyzed cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reactions using rose bengal (RB) is a promising technique for creating carbon&#8208;carbon/carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds directly from readily available compounds. Our review focuses on the current advancement in rose bengal that uses photocatalyzed carbon&#8208;carbon/carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;making reactions to synthesize various important organic molecules via CDC reactions.

         <title>An Organic Chemist's Guide to Fluorophores &#8211; Understanding Common and Newer Non&#8208;Planar Fluorescent Molecules for Biological Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores methods for optimizing emission wavelength, quantum yield and photostability of traditional and newer non&#8208;planar fluorophores (squaraine&#8208;rotaxanes and cycloparaphenylenes). We focus on the fundamental physical organic chemistry concepts leading to the fluorescent properties. We provide a detailed tutorial to understand fluorescence and enable the design of superior fluorophores for chemical biology.Social media promotion:







Abstract
Labeling and detection of biomolecules in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo is essential to many areas of biomedical science. Fluorophores stand as indispensable tools within chemical biology, underscoring the importance of fine&#8208;tuning their optical properties. This review focuses on methods for optimizing emission wavelength, quantum yield and photostability. We focus not just on the trends, but the fundamental physical organic chemistry concepts that inform the connection between molecular structure and fluorescent properties. This approach offers an essential understanding of fluorescence, enabling readers to develop a systematic analytical framework for thinking about fluorescence. Furthermore, an evaluation of newer non&#8208;planar fluorophores shines light on the bright future of fluorescent molecules.

         <title>Yttrium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydroamination of Norbornene with Simple Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intermolecular hydroamination of norbornene with simple amines was achieved using silyl&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;terphenoxide yttrium complexes. Excellent conversion was obtained for both benzylic and aliphatic amines. For benzyl and linear aliphatic amines, the highest activity was observed for the sterically more encumbered methyldiphenylsilyl&#8208;substituted complex, whereas the trimethylsilyl&#8208;substituted complex was more active for sterically encumbered primary amines.</dc:description>

         <title>Substituent Effects on the Electronic Ground State (Singlet versus Triplet) of Indenyl Cations: DFT and CASPT2 Studies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic ground states of cations (singlet versus triplet) attract significant attention in the discovery of novel carbocation chemistry. In this study, a strategy that controls the ground state of indenyl cations is established using density functional theory and complete active space multiconfiguration second order perturbation theory; electron&#8208;donating groups at C2 position stabilize the triplet state in energy.







Abstract
The electronic ground states of cations (singlet versus triplet) attract significant attention in the discovery of novel carbocation chemistry. Although the cyclopentadienyl cation exhibits a triplet ground state because of the antiaromaticity of the closed&#8208;shell singlet state, the ground state of the indenyl cation, which is a benzene&#8208;fused derivative of the cyclopentadienyl cation, is reportedly a closed&#8208;shell singlet state rather than a triplet state. In this study, in order to establish a strategy for controlling the ground state of indenyl cations, the substituent effects at the C2 and C5 positions of their structures were computed using density functional theory and complete active space multiconfiguration second order perturbation levels of theory.

         <dc:description>
The factors affecting the palladium&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;chloromethylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone were investigated. The combined effect of ligand, additive and N&#8208;Chlorophthalimide (NCP) is an important factor for the yield and ee value of this reaction. The method has good generalizability.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone is an important skeleton in many natural products and pharmaceuticals. The factors influencing the palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;chloromethylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones were investigated, including ligands, additives, the chlorine source, temperature, and solvents. We found that the reaction had broad substrate scope for the synthesis of the corresponding chiral products when the ligand, chlorine source and additives were optimized. The results will improve the catalytic synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;chloromethylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones.

         <title>Ring&#8208;expansion Reactions of the Biomass Derivative Cyrene via Enamine Dihalocyclopropanation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A ring&#8208;expansion process for the biomass derivative Cyrene obtained from levoglucosenone has been developed using gem&#8208;dihalocyclopropanes as intermediates. The process involves conversion of Cyrene to an enamine, reaction with an in situ generated dihalocarbene, and then ring&#8208;opening. Competition between endocyclic and exocyclic olefinic products was switchable using solvent and temperature, and ring&#8208;expanded vinyl halides were obtained in 50&#8208;64% yield from Cyrene. Under extended heating, dehalogenation occurred giving homologated levoglucosenone in 25% overall yield from Cyrene in 3 steps.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Minisci&#8208;Type Alkylation with Organoboron Derivatives Assisted by Catechol</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This manuscript describes a general strategy for the easily scale&#8208;up alkylation of heterocycles with a wide variety of boronic acids, boronates, and trifluoroborate salts under low&#8208;cost and simple conditions without using any transition&#8208;metal or organo&#8208;photocatalysts. The key additive of catechol plays an important role in this method which in&#8208;situ activated a variety of boron&#8208;base species to alkylboronic esters (R&#8211;BCat) with a low oxidation potential. The transformation is distinguished by a broad scope, such as drug molecules and natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>A Green Approach to Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitutions of Nicotinic Esters in Cyrene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The green solvent CyreneTM has emerged as a valuable substitute for conventional polar aprotic organic solvents such as DMF, DMSO and NMP (renowned for their toxicity and environmental concerns). However, in the presence of bases, Cyrene is prone to polymerization, thus potentially incompatible with reactions where a base is needed to generate reactive nucleophiles. In this study, we developed an efficient synthetic strategy for nucleophilic aromatic substitutions of nicotinic esters in Cyrene. The success of this protocol relies on a very short reaction time (only 15 minutes) which prevents polymerization from occurring. Indeed, Cyrene not only outperformed typical solvents such as DMF and DMSO, but also, being highly soluble in water, allowed an easy purification of the desired products by simple precipitation upon the addition of ice&#8208;water.</dc:description>

         <title>A novel synthesis of soluble, stable derivatives of the perchlorinated trityl radical</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new approach to the synthesis of derivatives of the perchlorinated tritryl radical is described. It relies on the fact that, under the conditions required to fully chlorinate the ortho positions of a triarylmethane, there is only minimal substitution of aryl fluorine by chlorine and then on the fact that, in the mixed Cl/F substituted triarylmethanes obtained, it is possible to selectively substitute the fluorine&#8208;bearing positions using the sodium salt of n&#8208;hexanol in n&#8208;hexanol/dimethylsulfoxide. The meta&#8208;hexyloxy derivatives obtained are much more soluble and photostable than the parent perchlorotrityl radical. For example, the introduction of four meta&#8208;hexyloxy substituents gives a radical where, under white light illumination, the lifetime is improved by a factor of almost 104. The photostability of the radical, the lifetime of the excited state and the fluorescence all decrease as the number of meta&#8208;hexyloxy substituents is increased. The improvements in solubility and in photostability observed should help in creating a more diverse range of perchlorotrityl radical derivatives and in the development of new applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Formylation of Propargylic Alcohols with Difluorocarbene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method for the synthesis of propargylic formates from propargylic alcohols and sodium chlorodifluoroacetate is reported. In the reaction, sodium chlorodifluoroacetate is used as a difluorocarbene precursor and a formylating reagent to provide a carbonyl source, while the triple bond of propargylic alcohols is not involved. The method shows convenient operation, good functional group tolerance and high site&#8208;selectivity under mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Imino Amidines and 2,3&#8208;Diamino Indolenines Using a One&#8208;Pot Graphene Oxide&#8208;Catalyzed Process</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The acid&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component (3C) UGI reaction of isocyanides, amines, and aldehydes generally gives &#945;&#8208;amino amidines. Herein, we report the graphene oxide (GO)&#8208;promoted 3C Ugi reaction followed by a C&#8208;N bond oxidation to provide rapid access to&#160;&#945;&#8208;imino amidines. GO plays a crucial role both in the multicomponent reaction and in the subsequent oxidation. Interestingly, &#945;&#8208;imino amidines bearing electron&#8208;donating groups undergo spontaneous cyclization leading substituted 2,3&#8208;diamino indolenines. The scope of the process has been investigated with respect to all three components, and a comparison between the one&#8208;pot and sequential approaches is given. The major advantages of the developed methodology include one&#8208;pot synthesis, operational simplicity, high atom economy, broad substrate scope, multicomponent character, and applicability towards gram scale synthesis. Recovery and regeneration of GO and investigation of its real active sites has been performed by control experiments and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Supported Heterogeneous Dirhodium(II) Catalyst for Nitrene and Carbene Transfer Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new self&#8208;supported Rh2A4 species has been prepared by reductive ligation of RhCl3 with adamantane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarboxylic acid. The catalyst has been demonstrated to be suitable for a range of nitrene transfer reactions, while also being suitable for carbene transfer. Importantly, the catalyst can be made in a one&#8208;pot two step procedure and used directly, as well as being reusable.







Abstract
The bimetallic rhodium(II) paddlewheel (Rh2A4) complex is one of the most reactive classes of rhodium catalysts, well&#8208;renowned for the most demanding carbene&#8208; and nitrene&#8208;transfer reactions. In view of its importance in modern synthetic chemistry, we herein report a facile approach for preparing a self&#8208;supported and reusable dirhodium(II) polymer&#8208;based heterogeneous catalyst through a reductive ligation protocol. The catalyst displays good reactivity for inter&#8208; and intramolecular nitrene&#8208; and carbene&#8208;insertions of various olefins, and can also engage in C&#8722;H insertion of hydrocarbon derivatives, all under ambient conditions. The catalyst reusability is expected to empower the use of these precious metal catalysts at industrial scales.

         <title>Total Synthesis of a Pancratistatin/Shikimic Acid Hybrid Analogue</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise synthesis of the pancratistatin framework, via a Heck reaction and subsequent cyclisation, is reported. The unfunctionalised model core of pancratistatin was synthesised from 1&#8208;cyclohexene&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acid in two steps in 50&#8201;% yield. A modified route was then successfully applied to (&#8722;)&#8208;shikimic acid to afford a novel pancratistatin/shikimic acid hybrid analogue that possesses three stereo&#8208;defined hydroxyl groups in the C&#8208;ring.

         <title>2H&#8208;Azirines: Recent Progress in Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2H&#8208;arizines are important three&#8208;membered heterocycles in organic chemistry. Recently, many advances in the synthesis and functionalization of 2H&#8208;arizines have been reported. Neber rearrangement, isomerization of isoxazole, oxidation of enamine, C&#8211;H bond activation, decomposition of vinyl azide, functionalization of alkyne, and multi&#8208;step synthesis have been developed for the efficient assembly of 2H&#8208;azirines. As versatile and highly strained three&#8208;membered unsaturated heterocycles, 2H&#8208;azirines can be used as distinctive building blocks towards significant functional groups, and have attracted extensive attention for the fabrication of numerous heterocycles. Recent studies have focused on [3+n] ring&#8208;expansion reactions, nucleophilic addition of C=N double bond or continuous nucleophilic addition followed by cyclization, ring&#8208;opening of 2H&#8208;azirines to acyclic compounds, and substitution of sp3&#8208;C&#8208;H of 2H&#8208;azirines. One of the most critical challenges is seeking for a selective opening of the specific three bonds of the strained azirine circle, some of what can be achieved on the basis of metal catalyst, photocatalysis, or combination of metal catalyst and photocatalysis. In this review, recent advances involving the synthesis and reactivity of 2H&#8208;arizines accompanied with challenges and breakthroughs are summarized. The review mainly covers the period from 2019 to 2023.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Preparation of Air Stable Organozinc Pivalates and their Applications in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review discusses&#160; various methods for the preparation of air and water&#8208;stable organozinc pivalates containing &#160;aryl, heteroaryl, alkyl, alkenyl, benzyl &#160;and alkynyl scaffolds achieved via i) selective metalation (DoM) in the presence of a directing group (DG) in the aromatic core, ii) direct oxidative Zn metal insertion/or X/M exchange reaction followed by transmetalation with Zn(Opiv)2, which are then further functionalized by Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reactions, or trapping with different aryl, heteroaryl, alkenyl, alkynyl electrophiles used by transition metal catalysts (Pd, Co, Ni, Cu). Selective deprotonation of aryl or heteroaryl derivatives can be performed using LDA, TMP&#8208;Mg and TMP&#8208;Zn reagents in the presence of a directing group on the aromatic system. Different organozinc reagents based on aromatic and non&#8208;aromatic structures with electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient substituents undergo&#160;transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions with aryl and heteroaryl halides and diaryl disulfides under mild conditions with the sustainable catalytic process. In this context, this review article provides a detailed summary of the numerous synthetic strategies and practical methods for the preparation of aryl, alkenyl, benzyl and alkynyl organozinc reagents that can be isolated in the pure solid form. Additionally, some recently published examples demonstrating their catalytic application in organic synthesis are discussed.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation and deuteration reactions of bicyclic alkenes using H2O and D2O as the sole hydrogen and deuterium sources, respectively, employing Zn or Mn as a metal reductant. Lewis&#8208;acid co&#8208;catalysts were found to promote the reaction whilst simultaneously catalyzing transesterification processes. Use of 1 atm of H2 allows for catalytic loading of the metal reductant. In all cases, the reaction operated with high functional&#8208;group tolerance and produced the reduced products in high yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring an Optimised Approach for Converting 6&#8208;Thioguanosine Derivatives to Asymmetric Disulphides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we present a systematic analysis of the synthesis of unsymmetrical disulphides employing 6&#8208;thioguanosine and its mono&#8208; and dinucleotides by three of the most common strategies: a nucleophilic substitution of the thiol, a thiol exchange reaction with another disulphide and oxidative dehydrogenation coupling reactions of S&#8208;H bonds. The exchange reaction was found to be the most efficient approach and could be used not only for nucleosides but also for nucleotides.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Keto&#8208;Enol&#8208;Tautomerism of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;Hydroxyethylidene)malononitrile and Its Lewis Adduct Formation with B(C6F5)3</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using NMR techniques and SCXRD, it is proven that 2&#8208;(1&#8208;hydroxyethylidene)malononitrile exists exclusively as the enol isomer in solution as well as in the solid state. Additionally, the Lewis acid mono&#8208; and diadduct of the enol with B(C6F5)3 as Lewis acid are fully characterized. DFT as well as CC calculations underline the preference of the enol isomer in the tautomeric equilibrium.







Abstract
2&#8208;(1&#8208;Hydroxyethylidene)malononitrile (4) is commercially sold as the keto isomer and is described in the literature as either a keto (4&#8201;b) or enol (4&#8201;a) species. Using NMR techniques and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, we were able to show that 4 exists exclusively as the enol isomer (4&#8201;a) in solution as well as in the solid state, which agrees with quantum chemical calculations. By adding one or two equivalents of the Lewis acid B(C6F5)3, the mono&#8208; or diadducts are formed in exergonic reactions, in which the enol form is further thermodynamically stabilized. The structure and acidity of enol 4&#8201;a and its borane adducts are discussed based on experimental and theoretical results.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Mediated Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling Reaction of Pyrrole and Indole Derivatives with Thiols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed earth&#8208;abundant copper&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H thiolations of pyrrole and indole derivatives with simple thiol reagents by employing a removable pyridyl directing group.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;mediated C(sp2)&#8722;H thiolation of pyrrole and indole derivatives with commercially available thiols utilizing a removable monodentate directing group is described. This protocol tolerated a broad range of functional groups and provided the thiolated products in 40&#8201;%&#8211;97&#8201;% yields. Furthermore, the synthetic utility of this protocol was demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive tryptophan peptide. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that a Cu(II)/Cu(III) reaction model is most likely to be involved in this C&#8722;H thiolation.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox&#8208;neutral 1,2,5&#8208;trifunctionalization of &#945;&#8208;hydroxyhexenoates is disclosed. The reaction proceeds through a sequence of radical addition, intramolecular heteroaryl migration, and radical&#8208;polar crossover deuteration, leading to functionalized &#945;&#8208;deuterated lactic acid derivatives. The reaction features mild photochemical conditions and provides an efficient approach for the synthesis of valuable deuterated molecules.

         <title>Metallocarbenes as Substituents in 8&#8208;Electron Electrocyclizations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism and the pericyclicity of metal&#8208;promoted bicyclization reactions that purportedly involve 8&#8208;electron electrocyclization steps were examined computationally, with results showing that these reactions do indeed proceed via 8&#8208;electron electrocyclizations rather than alternative pathways involving 4&#8208;electron electrocyclizations followed by Cope rearrangements.







Abstract
Density functional theory was used to elucidate the mechanism and the pericyclicity of chromium&#8208;catalyzed bicyclization reactions that purportedly involve 8&#8208;electron electrocyclization steps. Our computational results indicate that these reactions do indeed proceed via 8&#8208;electron electrocyclization rather than an alternative pathway involving 4&#8208;electron electrocyclization followed by Cope rearrangement. The role of C=[M] groups on the electrocyclization, specifically its pericyclicity, was examined in detail using modern theoretical tools.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Density functional theory was used to elucidate the mechanism and the pericyclicity of chromium-catalyzed bicyclization reactions that purportedly involve 8-electron electrocyclization steps. Our computational results indicate that these reactions do indeed proceed via 8-electron electrocyclization rather than an alternative pathway involving 4-electron electrocyclization followed by Cope rearrangement. The role of C=[M] groups on the electrocyclization, specifically its pericyclicity, was examined in detail using modern theoretical tools.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Isoxazolopyridines are highly significant for the development of pharmaceutics and new materials. In continuation of our ongoing research on transformations of 5&#8208;aminoisoxazoles, herein we report a divergent synthesis of two kinds of novel isoxazolo[5,4&#8208;b]pyridines via condensation of 5&#8208;aminoisoxazoles with &#946;,&#947;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;imino esters. By using two different silver salts and a phosphoric acid as catalysts, isoxazolo[5,4&#8208;b]pyridine&#8208;&#945;&#8208;carboxylates and isoxazolo[5,4&#8208;b]pyridine&#8208;&#947;&#8208;carboxylates were constructed as major isomers in moderate to good yields respectively. The structures of the two kinds of the isoxazolo[5,4&#8208;b]pyridines were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystal structural analyses. Furhermore, control experiments were conducted to elucidate the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Fun With Unusual Functional Groups: Sulfamates, Phosphoramidates, and Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl Silanols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>

This is an account of our efforts to develop new reactions with &#8220;unusual&#8221; functional groups, namely sulfamates, phosphoramidates, and di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl silanols.







Abstract
Compared to ubiquitous functional groups such as alcohols, carboxylic acids, amines, and amides, which serve as central &#8220;actors&#8221; in most organic reactions, sulfamates, phosphoramidates, and di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl silanols have historically been viewed as &#8220;extras&#8221;. Largely considered functional group curiosities rather than launch&#8208;points of vital reactivity, the chemistry of these moieties is under&#8208;developed. Our research program has uncovered new facets of reactivity of each of these functional groups, and we are optimistic that the chemistry of these fascinating molecules can be developed into truly general transformations, useful for chemists across multiple disciplines. In the ensuing sections, I will describe our efforts to develop new reactions with these &#8220;unusual&#8221; functional groups, namely sulfamates, phosphoramidates, and di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl silanols.

         <title>Deacetylation of Mannosylerythritol Lipids in Hydrophobic Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic deacetylation of mannosylerythritol lipid (MEL) biosurfactant mixtures in naturally derived deep eutectic solvents has comparable yields and kinetics to conventional organic solvents. Here, the example of thymol&#8208;coumarin 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture is shown where the diacetylated (MEL&#8722;A) and monoacetylated (MEL&#8722;B and MEL&#8722;C) are converted to fully deacetylated compound (MEL&#8722;D) with 50&#8201;% yield after 140&#8197;hours.







Abstract
Mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs) are a promising group of biosurfactants due to their high fermentation yield, selfassembly and biological activity. During fermentation by Pseudozyma aphidis, a mixture of MELs with different levels of acylation is formed, of which the fully deacetylated form is the most valuable. In order to reduce the environmental impact of deacetylation, an enzymatic process using natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) has been developed. We tested the deacetylation of a purified MELs mixture with immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B enzyme and 2&#8208;ethylhexanol as co&#8208;substrate in 140&#8197;h reactions with different NADES. We identified hydrophobic NADES systems with similar yields and kinetics as in pure 2&#8208;ethylhexanol solvent. Our results indicate that deacetylation of MELs mixtures in NADES as a solvent is possible with yields comparable to pure co&#8208;substrate and that hydrophobic NADES without carboxylic acid compounds facilitate the reaction to the greatest extent.

         <title>In Situ Assembly of a Metal&#8208;Templated Catalyst for Asymmetric Aldol Reactions: From the Metal Complexes Equilibria to a Practical System</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ready to synthesize bis(prolinamide)terpyridine ligand self&#8208;assembles with zinc(II) and a a hydrogen bond donor ligand to furnish a highly active catalyst for the asymmetric aldol reaction.







Abstract
A zinc(II)&#8208;templated catalyst assembling terpyridine and bipyridine organocatalytic ligands has been developed for the asymmetric aldol reaction. The system has been optimized to maximize the formation of the heteromeric bifunctional species through the determination of the equilibrium constants leading to the formation of all the species present. A practical, easy to synthesize catalytic system providing high stereoselectivity has been achieved in this way.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indole tethered 1,6&#8208;enynes were designed and prepared for the first time and then used to achieve an electrochemical annulation&#8208;iodosulfonylation reaction. The reaction of indole&#8208;tethered 1,6&#8208;enynes with arylsulfonyl hydrazide and KI led to unprecedented iodosulfonated pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoles in moderate to high yields under sustainable electrochemical oxidative conditions, which may open new avenues for the formation of pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoles.







Abstract
We present the first example of electrocatalytic three&#8208;component annulation&#8211;iodosulfonylation of indole&#8208;tethered 1,6&#8208;enynes with arylsulfonyl hydrazides and KI for accessing various iodosulfonated pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoles in moderate to excellent yields with high stereospecificity. This electrosynthesis opens new avenues for the construction of pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoles skeleton with good functional group compatibility under environmentally benign condition. Based on the control experiments and cyclic voltammetry data, we suggested the plausible reaction mechanism which included anodic oxidation, homolysis of arylsulfonyl iodide, arylsulfonyl radical addition, 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization, radical coupling or nucleophilic attack of iodide ions cascade.

         <dc:description>We conducted an investigation into the palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbon&#8208;sulfur cross&#8208;coupling reaction involving a 2&#8208;bromothiophene derivative and potassium thioacetate as a substitute for hydrogen sulfide. This investigation utilized kinetic and computational methods. We synthesized two palladium complexes supported by the bisphosphane ligands bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (DPPF) and bis(diisopropylphosphino)ferrocene (DiPPF), as well as their tentative intermediates in the catalytic cycle. Reaction rates were measured and then compared to computational predictions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Applications of Benzothienobenzofurans: A Review</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroacenes are considered as an important class of compounds for material applications due to their stability, electron&#8208;richness and tunable properties. Mostly, four ring containing heteroacenes have found immense applications in organic electronic devices and some of them have been successfully commercialized. One such class of heteroacene are benzothienobenzofuran for which four different isomers are reported to date based on the position where the benzothiophene unit is fused to the benzofuran ring. The available literature claims different synthetic strategies towards the benzothienobenzofurans starting from multistep synthesis to tandem transformations, electrochemical synthesis and annulations. Different metal catalyzed transformations including Pd&#8208;catalyzed dual C&#8208;H activations, Ullmann coupling, dual metal&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot processes etc. are reported for the synthesis of different isomers of benzothienobenzofurans. The present review analyses all the synthetic methodologies reported for the preparation of the four isomers and examines the generality of each method by highlighting its advantages and disadvantages. We discuss all available mechanisms of the reactions for the benefit of the readers. Finally, the existing basic photophysical properties of benzothienobenzofurans and their limited applications in fabricating devices for organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED), organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET), and organic phototransistor (OPT) uses are deliberated</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8208;Centered radical intermediates for C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds functionalization: An emerging approach towards alkyl thiocyanates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review focuses on the recent strategies developed for the thiocyanation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds via the formation of a C&#8208;centered radical intermediate. These approaches have provided easy access to original thiocyanate products of high interest.







Abstract
Organic thiocyanates are an important class of compounds because they are present in several bioactive molecules and can be used as key synthetic intermediates to access biorelevant sulfur&#8208;containing scaffolds. Although the chemistry of organothiocyanates has been studied for decades, a recent resurgence of interest in the field has led to major advances in the synthesis of new molecules bearing a thiocyanate moiety. An emerging and powerful strategy consists in the selective functionalization of C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds through the formation of a key C&#8208;centered radical intermediate. This review highlights the recent work that has been reported to access novel alkylthiocyanate scaffolds through this promising approach.

         <title>Multivalent Aminoseptanose Mimetics by Copper&#8208;Catalyzed (3+2) Cycloadditions of Azidomethyl&#8208;Substituted Bicyclic 1,2&#8208;Oxazines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Starting from readily available enantiopure azidomethyl&#8208;substituted bicyclic 1,2&#8208;oxazine derivatives and mono&#8208;, di&#8208; or trialkynes, their copper&#8208;catalyzed (3+2) cycloadditions furnished a series of 1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;linked compounds in good yields. These click reactions proceeded smoothly at room temperature when copper iodide as catalyst was used in the presence of triethylamine and tris[(1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)methyl]amine as ligand. Generally, the unprotected bicyclic 1,2&#8208;oxazine derivatives seemed to show slightly higher reactivity and provided better yields compared with their silyl&#8208;protected counterparts. Exhaustive hydrogenolysis with cleavage of the 1,2&#8208;oxazine N&#8208;O bonds in the presence of palladium on charcoal as promotor is feasible but was found to be capricious. Reasonable results were obtained when acetic acid employed as cosolvent. By applying these conditions, several of the bicyclic 1,2&#8208;oxazine derivatives were successfully converted into the expected mono&#8208; or divalent aminooxepine derivatives which can be regarded as aminoseptanose mimetics.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Ring Opening Reactions of Vinylcyclopropanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vinylcyclopropanes can be generally classified as activated and unactivated VCPs. Activated VCPs have strong electron withdrawing groups present in the cyclopropane ring, while unactivated VCPs lack strong electron withdrawing groups in their structures. These VCPs can be activated using suitable asymmetric catalysts to afford various types of chiral ring&#8208;opened products that are synthetically valuable compounds.







Abstract
Vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs) are important building blocks with multifaceted reactivity. Catalytic asymmetric ring opening of vinylcyclopropanes is a highly efficient process to access valuable chiral molecules with diverse functionalities that can be further functionalized for a series of synthetic purposes. VCPs are very well&#8208;known substrates for cycloaddition reactions and this chemistry has been widely explored. On the contrary, despite of enormous synthetic potential, development of new innovative strategies for the catalytic, asymmetric ring opening of VCPs is somewhat underdeveloped. Recently, several significant examples have emerged in the literature for various asymmetric ring opening of both activated and unactivated vinylcyclopropanes that involve transition metal catalysis. These developments are relevant additions to the vinylcyclopropane chemistry. In this review, we aim to summarize all the catalytic asymmetric ring opening transformations reported till date and provide a comprehensive analysis of these research outcomes.

         <title>An In&#8208;Situ&#8208;Formed Copper&#8208;Based Perfluorinated Catalytic System for the Aerobic Oxidation of Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new, in&#8197;situ generated, fluorous biphasic catalytic protocol for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols was developed. The (pre)catalytic species utilized are stable, widely available and easily synthesized: Cu2O as the copper source, perfluorinated NHC salt precursors, TEMPO, and O2 as the oxidant. The perfluorinated catalytic system solution can be recovered and reused successfully, up to six times.







Abstract
Herein, we report a new catalytic protocol for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols. The catalytic system is formed in&#8197;situ, in a straightforward and user&#8208;friendly manner, combining a widely available copper source (Cu2O) with one imidazolium salt precursor bearing perfluorinated moieties. Our protocol uses TEMPO, as additive, and the reaction takes place at the interface of a biphasic solvent system, consisting of anisole and 1&#8208;bromoperfluorooctane. The as&#8208;prepared carbonyl compounds remain in the organic solvent, while the catalytic system remains in the fluorous phase. In this manner, the isolation and purification of the desired products are quite facile. Our protocol uses low catalytic loadings and is more efficient with primary alcohols, affording the desired products in good to excellent yields. The fluorous phase containing the catalytic system can be efficiently recovered and reused for at least six times, without a significant decrease in its catalytic efficiency.

Further transformation yields analogues of lamellarin alkaloids in which a dihydropyrrolizine unit replaces the pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline component of the natural products.







Abstract
Several N&#8208;ethoxycarbonylmethyl enaminones, prepared by Eschenmoser sulfide contraction between N&#8208;(ethoxycarbonylmethyl)pyrrolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thione and various ortho&#8208;oxygenated phenacyl halides, underwent cyclisation to give ethyl 6&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrolizine&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylates upon microwave heating with silica gel in xylene. With enaminones made from ortho&#8208;hydroxyphenacyl halides, not only did dihydropyrrolizine formation take place, but spontaneous lactonisation also occurred to give 9,10&#8208;dihydrochromeno[4,3&#8208;b]pyrrolizin&#8208;6(8H)&#8208;ones. Bromination and Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura arylation of these chromenopyrrolizines at the free C&#8722;H site on the pyrrole ring afforded four analogues of the lamellarin alkaloids in which a pyrrolidine ring replaces the isoquinoline system in the fused polycyclic core. The product 11&#8208;(3,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydrochromeno[4,3&#8208;b]pyrrolizin&#8208;6(8H)&#8208;one, in particular, is a congener of the well&#8208;known lamellarin G trimethyl ether. Preliminary results pertaining to an extension to chromenone&#8208;fused indolizines are also reported.

         <title>Synthesis of Cryptophanes: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review details current advancements in synthesizing cryptophane host molecules post the 2009 comprehensive review by Brotin and Dutasta. It categorizes literature based on methods for creating the cryptophane core and evolving late&#8208;stage functionalization techniques. Focus is placed on template synthesis, coupling, late&#8208;stage functionalization, small&#8208;molecule binding, and some applications.







Abstract
This review covers the latest developments in the synthesis of cryptophane host molecules since the publication of the last extensive review by Brotin and Dutasta in 2009. The literature has been categorized according to the synthetic method for generating the cryptophane core and we also emphasize emerging late&#8208;stage functionalization approaches. The synthetic strategies towards cryptophanes can be broadly categorized into the well&#8208;established direct&#8208; (two&#8208;step), template&#8208; and coupling (or capping) methods. The examples covered in this review mainly highlight template&#8208;based synthesis, coupling approaches and late&#8208;stage functionalization.

         <title>Difluoroethylation Reactions of Organic Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As an important class of fluorinated compounds, MeCF2&#8208;featured compounds have found growing benefits in agrochemical and pharmaceutical applications. The known synthesis strateges for difluoroethylation established in the past years are discussed in detail in this concept.







Abstract
Given the profound effect of fluorine&#8208;containing groups in improving the chemical, physical, and biological properties of the parent compound, the fluorine&#8208;containing groups were receiving increasing attention in the medicinal, pharmaceutical, agricultural, and material sciences. Unlike well&#8208;developed trifluoromethylation and difluoromethylation reactions, the efficient and mild methods for rapid introduction of CF2Me are still underdeveloped, despite their important applications in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. This concept describes recent progress in difluoroethylation functionalization.

         <title>Lewis Base&#8208;Boryl Radicals Promoted Selective Mono&#8208; and Di&#8208; Hydrodechlorination of Trichloroacetamides and Acetates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
4&#8208;Dimethylaminopyridine&#160;(DMAP)&#8208; and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;boryl radicals were found to promote selective mono&#8208; or dihydrodechlorination of trichloroacetamides and acetates upon treatment with dilauroyl peroxide (DLP) as radical initiator and thiophenol as polarity reversal catalyst. Substituting the hydrogen atom donor, i.&#8201;e. Lewis base&#8208;borane, to its deuterated counterparts promoted mono&#8208; or dideuterodechlorination instead.







Abstract
Mono and dichloro&#8208;substituted organic molecules are shown to possess significant roles in various fields, especially in medicinal chemistry. One approach to synthesizing these compounds involves the selective dechlorination of easily prepared trichloromethyl compounds. Nevertheless, developing a practical approach that allows selective mono&#8208; and dihydrodechlorination is a challenging task. Herein, we introduced a method for selective mono&#8208; and dihydrodechlorination of trichloroacetamides and acetates which was promoted by two different Lewis base&#8208;boryl radicals. Accordingly, 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)&#8208;borane enabled mono&#8208;substitution of chlorine atom by hydrogen while dihydro&#8208;substitution of chlorine atoms was promoted by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;boryl radical. Using deuterated Lewis base&#8208;borane as deuterium atom source, mono&#8208; and dideuterodechlorination were also successfully took place. This protocol features broad substrate scope and operates under mild reaction conditions.

Substituting the hydrogen atom donor, i.&#8201;e. Lewis base-borane, to its deuterated counterparts promoted mono- or dideuterodechlorination instead.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mono and dichloro-substituted organic molecules are shown to possess significant roles in various fields, especially in medicinal chemistry. One approach to synthesizing these compounds involves the selective dechlorination of easily prepared trichloromethyl compounds. Nevertheless, developing a practical approach that allows selective mono- and dihydrodechlorination is a challenging task. Herein, we introduced a method for selective mono- and dihydrodechlorination of trichloroacetamides and acetates which was promoted by two different Lewis base-boryl radicals. Accordingly, 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)-borane enabled mono-substitution of chlorine atom by hydrogen while dihydro-substitution of chlorine atoms was promoted by &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-boryl radical. Using deuterated Lewis base-borane as deuterium atom source, mono- and dideuterodechlorination were also successfully took place. This protocol features broad substrate scope and operates under mild reaction conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Sulfonimidamide&#8208;Based 1,2&#8208;Benzothiazines by [4+2] Oxidative Annulation of Sulfonimidamides and Alkynes in Water under Visible Light</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfonimidamide (SIA)&#8208;based 1,2&#8208;benzothiazines were prepared by a [4+2] annulation reaction. The products were further transformed into o&#8208;acyl&#8208;N&#8208;acyl SIAs and a SIA&#8208;based dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzothiazine through oxidative C=C cleavage and selective C=C reduction, respectively.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced rhodium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H bond activation of sulfonimidamides (SIAs) and subsequent [4+2] annulation with an alkyne in water to yield SIA&#8208;based 1,2&#8208;benzothiazines in good to high yields in short reaction times. Further, the C=C bond of the benzothiazine can be cleaved under environmentally friendly conditions (oxygen atmosphere and blue LEDs) to deliver o&#8208;acyl&#8208;N&#8208;acyl SIAs. Interestingly, o&#8208;acyl&#8208;N&#8208;acyl SIAs can also be synthesized directly from SIAs in very good yields without isolating the benzothiazine. The selective and efficient reduction of the benzothiazine C=C bond in the presence of InCl3/R3SiH led to the formation of a hitherto unknown SIA&#8208;based dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzothiazine in quantitative yield.

         <title>Nucleophilic Addition of Bulky Aryl Substituents to Pentacene&#8208;6,13&#8208;quinone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four novel pentacenes carrying bulky substituents at 5,7,12,14&#8208;, 6,13&#8208;, and 5,13&#8208;positions were synthesized and their properties investigated depending on substituent size and location. The 5,13&#8208;disubstituted derivative shows the highest photostability.







Abstract
We investigate the introduction of bulky aryl substituents of the biphenyl, terphenyl, and quaterphenyl type at the 6,13 and 5,7,12,14 positions of the pentacene scaffold by reaction of the corresponding quinones with lithium organic reagents. The 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;yl substituent could be installed at the 5,7,12,14&#8208;positions and regioselectively either at 6,13 or at the 5,13 positions. The unsymmetrical substitution motif results from concomitant 1,2 and 1,4&#8208;addition to 6,13&#8208;pentacenequinone. A one&#8208;pot protocol leads to isomeric symmetric 6,13&#8208;disubstituted pentacenes and allows installation of two 5&#8242;&#8208;phenyl&#8208;[1,1&#8242;:3&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terphenyl]&#8208;2&#8208;yl substituents. The four new pentacenes differ in crystal packing and photochemical stability.

         <title>N&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides (NCAs): Unorthodox and Useful Reagents for Amide Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides are species derived from the addition of a carboxylic acid to an isocyanate, and are well&#8208;known to form amides products with release of CO2. Although first reported over 120&#8197;years ago, their potential use as reagents for amide bond&#8208;forming reactions is currently underexplored. In this article, the properties, synthesis and current applications of NCAs are highlighted.







Abstract
N&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides (NCAs) are compounds derived from the addition of a carboxylic acid to an isocyanate, and are known to form amides readily with the release of CO2 as a by&#8208;product. NCAs have been known for over 120&#8197;years, but despite their lengthy history, have remained so far overshadowed by more traditional approaches to amide bond formation. In this review, the potential utility of NCAs in the context of amide bond formation is reviewed and their preparation, reactivity and practical application are also discussed.

         <title>Study of the Mechanism of 7&#8208;exo&#8208;trig Cyclizations of Aryl, Vinyl, and Alkyl Radicals on Oxime Ethers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our research combines experimental techniques and DFT calculations to investigate the mechanism of 7&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization of aryl, vinyl, and alkyl radicals on oxime ethers. These cyclization processes are exothermic and irreversible, showing a preference for nucleophilic alkyl radicals. The high cyclization rate constants (103&#8211;108&#8197;s&#8722;1) highlight the synthetic potential of these reactions for constructing seven&#8208;membered carbocyclic and heterocyclic systems.







Abstract
In this work, we conducted a study of 7&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclizations mechanism involving aryl, vinyl, and alkyl radicals on oxime ethers. Initially, the reaction of brominated oxime ether 9&#8201;a with (TMS)3SiH and AIBN gave rise to aryl radicals that underwent a 7&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization on the oxime ether, yielding dibenzoxepine 10&#8201;a, and the ipso reaction and reduction products were obtained as well. Approximate rate constants at 80&#8201;&#176;C for the 7&#8208;exo&#8208;trig (1.0&#215;108&#8197;s&#8722;1) and the ipso cyclization (4.3&#215;107&#8197;s&#8722;1) were determined by competition experiments. DFT calculations showed good agreement with the experimental results. The reduction rate constant of the N&#8208;alkoxyaminyl radical with (TMS)3SiH was calculated to be 4.1&#215;10&#8722;1&#8197;M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1; while the rate constants for the 7&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclizations of vinyl and alkyl radicals on the oxime ether were estimated in the ranges of 106&#8197;s&#8722;1&#8211;108&#8197;s&#8722;1 and 103&#8197;s&#8722;1&#8211;108&#8197;s&#8722;1, respectively. The 7&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization reactions involving aryl, vinyl, and alkyl radicals with oxime ethers were found to be an exothermic and irreversible process, with the oximic carbon showing a preference for nucleophilic alkyl radicals. This kinetic study contributes to the deeper understanding of radical&#8208;mediated cyclizations, enabling the efficient design of complex synthetic routes.

         <title>Evaluating Multienzyme Cascade Routes for Pharmaceutically Relevant Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme catalysis has emerged as a greener and more sustainable approach for obtaining a variety of chiral building blocks and APIs. In recent years, researchers have successfully demonstrated various multienzyme cascade syntheses to obtain APIs. Following these breakthroughs, the application of enzyme cascade reactions is driving the industry to manufacture APIs on a multikilogram scale. This also emphasizes the promising potential of Systems Biocatalysis, which is yet to be fully harnessed for a better tomorrow. This review highlights the importance of the recently developed multienzyme cascade synthesis of pharmaceutically important bioactive molecules.







Abstract
The constant demand for sustainable approaches to pharmaceutical synthesis has thrived the enzyme catalysis (biocatalysis) field. The most sought&#8208;after features like high specificity, environmentally benign, and biodegradable nature have rendered enzymatic processes predominantly eco&#8208;friendly. Owing to these merits, biocatalysis is now being developed extensively to exploit their applications in designing alternate and sustainable synthetic routes for manufacturing pharmaceuticals, in line with green chemistry principles. Further, combining multiple enzymes in one&#8208;pot is a highly efficient methodology as it eliminates intermediate isolation, shifts equilibrium in the forward direction, and proceeds in ambient aqueous conditions. This review highlights the importance of recently developed multienzyme cascade synthesis of pharmaceutically important bioactive molecules by relating them with their well&#8208;known chemical route.

         <title>How to Set the &#8220;Chirality&#8221; of Polyhedral Small Molecule Hydrocarbons: Decoration and Editing of Cubane Skeleton</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Concept, we introduce chirality via substituent introduction to cubane and discuss the synthesis associated with imparting chirality to polyhedral hydrocarbons like cuneane, semibullvalene, bishomocubane and homocuneane using &#8220;Scaffold&#8208;editing&#8221; method, thereby highlighting the future possibilities in this field of research.







Abstract
Small polyhedral hydrocarbons represented by cubane have attracted attention as potential molecular scaffolds for pharmaceuticals as benzene bioisoster. Cubane is also expected to be used as a chiral scaffold, but due to its high symmetry, it is necessary to introduce chirality by sequential site&#8208;selective introduction of substituents. Furthermore, polyhedral desymmetrized isomers of cubane, such as cuneane and semibullvalene, and extended cage compounds, such as bishomocubane and homocuneane, exhibit chirality and are also expected to be used as new optically active scaffolds. In this concept, we would like to explain the synthetic routes we have planned, specifically, the decoration and editing of the cubane skeleton.

A novel strategy of visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis ipso&#8208;annulation of activated alkynes with polychloroalkanes for the synthesis of 3&#8208;polychloroalkyl spiro[4,5]trienones, which used 4&#8208;methoxybenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate salt as a hydrogen atom transfer reagent.







Abstract
A novel strategy of visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis ipso&#8208;annulation of activated alkynes with polychloroalkanes for the synthesis of 3&#8208;polychloroalkyl spiro[4,5]trienones, which used 4&#8208;methoxybenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate salt as a hydrogen atom transfer reagent, is described. This polychloroalkylation/ spirocyclization of alkynes offers a widely range of 3&#8208;polychloroalkyl&#8208;spiro[4,5]trienone derivatives in high yields with a broad substrate scope via selective C(sp3)&#8208;H homolytic cleavage. The results of controlled experiments showed that this method involves a radical process. The polyhaloalkyl radical species generated from intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) between aryl radical and polychloroalkanes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel strategy of visible-light photoredox catalysis &lt;i&gt;ipso&lt;/i&gt;-annulation of activated alkynes with polychloroalkanes for the synthesis of 3-polychloroalkyl spiro[4,5]trienones, which used 4-methoxybenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate salt as a hydrogen atom transfer reagent, is described. This polychloroalkylation/ spirocyclization of alkynes offers a widely range of 3-polychloroalkyl-spiro[4,5]trienone derivatives in high yields with a broad substrate scope &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; selective C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)-H homolytic cleavage. The results of controlled experiments showed that this method involves a radical process.

         <title>Catalytic C(sp2)&#8722;H Trifluoroethylation of Indoles via Iron&#8208;Carbene Insertion</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A iron&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H bond trifluoroethylation of electron&#8208;rich aromatic system using N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones as carbene precursor is reported. This method allowed for the trifluoroethylation of indoles in high yield with excellent functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Pharmacological properties of a bioactive molecule can be improved significantly by placing a fluoroalkyl group on its scaffold. However, direct stitching of fluoroalkyl groups to aromatic compounds via C&#8722;H bond activation or insertion reaction is a difficult task, thus challenging and of high demand. Herein, an alternative to the Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation, we describe an uncharted strategy for selective and efficient trifluoroethylation of indole that relies on iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation of aromatic compounds and proceeds via Fe(III)&#8208;carbene insertion into C(sp2)&#8722;H bond of indole using trifluoroacetaldehyde N&#8208;triftosylhydrazone as a carbene precursor and FeTPPCl as catalyst.

         <title>Diastereoselective (8+3)&#8208;Cycloadditions of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes with Tropothione</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
D&#8208;A cyclopropanes are shown to undergo (8+3)&#8208;cycloadditions with tropothione under Lewis acid catalysis. Heptatriene&#8208;fused thiopyran scaffolds derived in this way are found to be formed without a 1,3&#8208;H shift, in contrast to previously reported similar reactions with the parent tropone. The reaction is diastereospecific and a plausible mechanism is proposed based on the experimental findings.







Abstract
Reactions of dimethyl 2&#8208;arylcyclopropane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates, used as representatives of D&#8208;A cyclopropanes, with tropothione were carried out in the presence of scandium triflate as a catalyst, under mild conditions (CH2Cl2 solution, rt). The anticipated (8+3)&#8208;cycloaddition products, cycloheptatriene fused thiopyrans, were obtained in good to excellent yields. Cycloadditions occurred with complete diastereoselectivity and in all cases single diastereomers were formed. Structures of isolated cycloadducts were established based on spectroscopic data and in two cases they were unambiguously confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. In contrast to an analogous (8+3)&#8208;cycloaddition reported for parent tropone, which was performed in the presence of Ni(ClO4)2, no 1,3&#8208;H shift leading to products possessing a CH2 moiety located within the seven&#8208;membered ring was observed.

         <title>Synthesis, Reactivity and Application of Vinyl Sulfoximines and Vinyl Aminosulfoxonium Salts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the multifaceted chemistry of vinyl sulfoximines and vinyl aminosulfoxonium salts is discussed. Emphasis is placed on the application in asymmetric synthesis. The discussion focuses on functionalized vinyl sulfoximines and vinyl aminosulfoxonium salts, as well as transformations that exploit the nucleofugacity of the sulfonimidoyl and aminosulfoxonium group.







Abstract
The combination of a sulfonimidoyl and aminosulfoxonium group with a double bond renders vinyl sulfoximines and vinyl aminosulfoxonium salts particularly versatile classes of compounds in organic synthesis. The discussion of vinyl sulfoximines includes in addition to the synthesis, the Michael reaction and its application in asymmetric synthesis, the synthesis, structure and application of &#945;&#8208;lithiovinyl sulfoximines, the nickel&#8208;catalyzed and copper&#8208;mediated anionic cross&#8208;coupling reaction of &#945;&#8208;metallovinyl sulfoximines, the synthesis of acyclic and cyclic dienyl vinyl sulfoximines and the ring&#8208;closing metathesis, the hydroalumination and reductive Pauson&#8208;Khand reaction, the nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction, the vinyl&#8208;allyl isomerization, the cycloaddition, and the cyclization. The discussion of vinyl aminosulfoxonium salts includes in addition to the synthesis, the Michael reaction, the ethylenation of protic nucleophiles, the synthesis of allyl aminosulfoxonium salts and the nucleophilic substitution, the synthesis of allyl aminosulfoxonium ylides and the imino ester aziridination, the synthesis of vinyl aminosulfoxonium ylides, the synthesis of alkynes and dihydrofurans, the nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction, and the intramolecular substitution of the amino group.

         <dc:description>
This study presents a method for synthesizing pyridine, quinoline, and isoquinoline ketones from 2&#8208;halogenated N&#8208;heterocycles under mild conditions. The use of H2O as both solvent and oxygen source makes the reaction environmentally friendly, with broad substrate applicability and high functional group tolerance.







Abstract
This study describes a method of synthesising pyridine, quinoline, and isoquinoline ketones using 2&#8208;halogenated N&#8208;heterocycles as the starting materials under mild reaction conditions. Considering the significance of pyridones in organic chemistry, developing novel, green synthetic strategies is highly desirable. The reaction employs H2O as the solvent and source of O, rendering it green, and it is simple to execute, with a broad substrate scope and an excellent functional group tolerance.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature N&#8208;Alkylation of Amines with Alcohols in Protic Solvents Catalyzed by Iridium Complexes Bearing N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalyzed N&#8208;alkylation of alcohols and amines in protic solvents under mild conditions was investigated using simple NHC complexes developed by our group. We achieved the synthesis of various alkylamines under mild conditions, such as 40&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C, using iridium complexes bearing NHC ligands with simple structures and protic solvents such as 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol and 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol.







Abstract
Amines are important compounds found in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and fine chemicals. Therefore, the development of elegant, environmentally friendly, and simple synthetic methods is desirable. Recently, the borrowing&#8208;hydrogen (BH) strategy has received considerable attention for C&#8722;N bond formations because of its high atomic efficiency and the absence of toxic waste generation. Researchers have recently reported that the use of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands with strong electron&#8208;donating properties and protic solvents can increase the catalytic activity in the BH strategy. Therefore, herein, we focused on the versatility of the synthetic methods, such as a synthetic system that allows simple synthesis, operates at low reaction temperatures, and involves the use of effective solvent simultaneously. The catalyzed N&#8208;alkylation of alcohols and amines in protic solvents under mild conditions was investigated using simple NHC complexes developed by our group. We achieved the synthesis of various alkylamines under mild conditions, such as 40&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C, using iridium complexes comprising NHC ligands with simple structures and protic solvents such as 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol and 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol.

Recently, the borrowing-hydrogen (BH) strategy has received considerable attention for C&#8722;N bond formations because of its high atomic efficiency and the absence of toxic waste generation. Researchers have recently reported that the use of N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands with strong electron-donating properties and protic solvents can increase the catalytic activity in the BH strategy. Therefore, herein, we focused on the versatility of the synthetic methods, such as a synthetic system that allows simple synthesis, operates at low reaction temperatures, and involves the use of effective solvent simultaneously. The catalyzed N-alkylation of alcohols and amines in protic solvents under mild conditions was investigated using simple NHC complexes developed by our group. We achieved the synthesis of various alkylamines under mild conditions, such as 40&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C, using iridium complexes comprising NHC ligands with simple structures and protic solvents such as 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Trifluoromethyl Ketone Galactose Catalyst for Asymmetric Epoxidation: Experimental and Theoretical Model</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel organocatalyst based on a d&#8208;galactose skeleton is obtained by inserting a trifluoromethyl ketone on C6. It forms in&#8197;situ, in the presence of Oxone, a dioxirane able to perform the asymmetric epoxidation of olefins. A theoretical study and a mnemonic model to predict the stereochemical results are elaborated.







Abstract
Since the introduction of the Shi catalyst, the organocatalytic epoxidation of olefins has become an area of continued research interest. To explore the possibility of enhancing the efficiency and stability of the catalyst, the synthesis of a galactose&#8208;derived trifluoromethyl ketone, and its use for stereoselective epoxidation reaction that exploits a transitory dioxirane as active species are herein reported. The trifluoromethyl ketone was built on the C6 of a protected d&#8208;galactopyranose. The organocatalyst was obtained smoothly in a few steps, and when utilized for stereoselective epoxidation exhibited excellent stability as no chemical alterations were observed during the reaction. The stereoselectivity, although sometimes moderate, appears surprisingly high considering the conformational freedom of the trifluoromethyl ketone moiety.
DFT calculations were performed to investigate the interactions involved in regulating the observed selectivities. Moreover, a new mnemonic model has been developed to serve as a fast&#8208;predicting tool for epoxidation of new substrates.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free C&#8722;H Alkylation of Cyclic Aldimines with Alkylboronic Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular oxygen&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H bond alkylation of cyclic aldimines with alkylboronic acids is described. This strategy allows efficiently construction of C&#8722;C bond through radical&#8208;mediated pathway, giving rise to a series of 4&#8208;alkylated cyclic aldimines with broad functional groups in the absence of transition metal catalyst and external oxidant.







Abstract
Molecular oxygen&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H bond alkylation of cyclic aldimines has been reported, which avoids the use of transition metals and additional oxidants. This method allows straightforward access to a series of cyclic aldimine derivatives through a free radical course. Furthermore, this transformation features mild conditions, excellent yields and good functional group tolerance.

         <title>A Practical, Scalable Synthesis of 1,18&#8208;Octadecanedioic acid&#8208;Paclitaxel (ODDA&#8208;PTX)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Paclitaxel is one of the most important chemotherapy agents and it has shown activity against a variety of human cancers. In the past years several derivatives and formulations have been developed to improve its activity and reduce its toxicity. Recently, 1,18&#8208;Octadecanedioic acid&#8208;Paclitaxel (ODDA&#8208;PTX), obtained by conjugation of Paclitaxel with a long&#8208;chain diacid, has emerged as a promising Paclitaxel prodrug, with high efficacy and low toxicity. A novel strategy for its synthesis has been developed and is herein described. The approach is based on the mono&#8208;allyl protection of octadecanedioic acid (ODDA) and on the Pd&#8208;catalyzed removal of the allyl ester after coupling with Paclitaxel. This strategy is superior to previously reported procedures in that it affords the ODDA&#8208;PTX product with much higher purity, avoids chromatographic purifications and can be practically scaled&#8208;up for the industrial production of ODDA&#8208;PTX.</dc:description>

In this review, the synthesis and properties of sulfur&#8208;containing 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles, including 4&#8208;sulfanyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles, 5&#8208;sulfanyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles, N&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles, 4&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles, 5&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles, sulfur&#8208; and heteroatom&#8208;containing 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles, were highlighted.







Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;containing 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles display bioactivities like antidepressant, antifungal activity, antitumor, etc. Numerous approaches have been established to form sulfur&#8208;containing 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. 4&#8208;Sulfanyl&#8208; and 5&#8208;sulfanyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles were produced by metal&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (AAC), etc. N&#8208;Sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles were generated via the reaction of acetylides with sulfonyl azides, CuAAC. 4&#8208;Sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles were produced through [3+2] cycloaddition and reaction of azide with bromovinylsulfonyl fluoride. Although 5&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles were formed successfully via RuAAC, their synthetic approaches were very limited. 1&#8208;Phosphinyl&#8208;2&#8208;sulfanylethynes were suitable substances to access sulfur&#8208; and phosphorus&#8208;containing triazoles. In this review, the synthesis and properties of sulfur&#8208;containing 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles were highlighted. Initially, the properties of organosulfurs, 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles and sulfur&#8208;containing 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles were briefly introduced. After stating the general procedures to construct 1,2,3&#8208;triazole skeleton, the synthetic approaches and properties of sulfur&#8208;involved 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles were sorted and described in details. According to different kinds of sulfur&#8208;containing 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles, synthetic methods and features of 4&#8208;sulfanyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles, 5&#8208;sulfanyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles, N&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles, 4&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles, 5&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles, sulfur&#8208; and heteroatom&#8208;containing 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles were summarized.

         <title>Oxidative Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Nitroketones from &#945;&#8208;Substituted Malononitrile and Nitromethane Using Molecular Oxygen without Condensation Reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new and feasible oxidative synthetic method for &#945;&#8208;nitroketones from &#945;&#8208;substituted malononitriles and nitromethane under molecular oxygen has been developed. This provides an environmentally friendly synthesis of &#945;&#8208;nitroketones using only base and molecular oxygen, without the need for any condensation reagents. The method avoids the use of dangerous and highly polluting chemicals enabling a safe and easy setup, which affords high yields even in the presence of sterically hindered substrates.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formamide (HCONH2), a well&#8208;known organic compound in chemistry and biology, can be employed for molecular construction. The focus of this review is to discuss the widespread use of formamide as a relevant C&#8208;1 building block in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Formamide (HCONH2), a well&#8208;known organic compound in chemistry and biology, can be employed for molecular construction. The chemistry of formamide, which involves condensation reactions, transamidation reactions, cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and radical reactions, can be explored to synthesize more complex organic compounds. The focus of this review is to discuss the widespread use of formamide as a relevant C&#8208;1 building block in organic synthesis.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Highly Fused Quinazolinone Derivatives via Multiple C&#8722;C Bond Formations and 1,4&#8208;Palladium Migration</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a mild and efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed annulation of 3&#8208;(2&#8208;halophenyl)quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones with alkyne was developed for the synthesis of fused quinazolinone derivatives in 43&#8211;80&#8201;% yields. Notably, we observed remarkable changes in the product yield by modulating bases/additives.







Abstract
An efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed annulation of 3&#8208;arylquinazolinones with mono and double alkyne insertion was developed for the synthesis of fused quinazolinone derivatives in 43&#8211;80&#8201;% yields. A notable effect was observed in product yield, when bases/additives were modulated. The reaction mechanism is believed to proceed through C&#8722;X cleavage/alkyne insertion/1,4&#8208;Pd migration and C&#8722;H annulation in a one&#8208;pot manner.

         <title>In Continuo Pd&#8208;Catalysed Cross Coupling Reactions of Organolithium Reagents with Aryl Bromides Under Aerobic Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct use of readily available and relatively inexpensive organolithium reagents in cross&#8208;coupling reactions is grown in recent years. However, the large&#8208;scale application of these commodity reagents remains a formidable challenge. Here we report fast, efficient, and in continuo Pd&#8208;catalysed cross couplings of organolithium reagents with aryl bromides that proceed in 40&#8197;s, allowing the synthesis of a variety of functionalised aryl compounds without pre&#8208;catalyst activation and inert atmosphere.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;C couplings are widely used to synthesize organic molecules. In this area, the direct use of readily available and relatively inexpensive organolithium reagents in Pd cross&#8208;coupling reactions represents an attractive option, but its large&#8208;scale application remains a formidable challenge. The high reactivity of organolithium reagents, along with the need (sometimes) of tailored, expensive catalysts and long reaction times, often prevent these procedures from being applied to industry. However, continuous flow technologies recently emerged as a powerful tool in discovery and process chemistry, and may offer a solution to overcome the above issues. Here, we wish to report fast, efficient, in continuo Pd&#8208;catalysed cross coupling reactions of organolithium reagents with aryl bromides, under aerobic conditions, that do not require an inert atmosphere, with a catalyst loading that has been lowered up to 0.5&#8201;% mol. The methodology has a wide scope and has been successfully applied to the synthesis in flow of a novel class of anti&#8208;cancer compounds.

         <title>Cooperativity in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Macrocycles Derived from Nucleobases</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical analyses reveal that introducing rigid linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated acetylene linkers into a supramolecular building block hampers the cooperative self&#8208;assembly of hydrogen&#8208;bonded macrocycles. This effect originates from the electron abstracting capability of the linker and becomes amplified when the size of the linker increases.







Abstract
Introducing a rigid linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated acetylene linker into a supramolecular building block consisting of a hydrogen&#8208;bond donor side and a hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor side yields a decrease in cooperativity in the resulting formed quartet. This follows from our Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital and Voronoi deformation density analyses of hydrogen&#8208;bonded macrocycles based on guanine and cytosine nucleobases. The acetylene linker abstracts electron density from the hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor and donor, making the hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor more negatively charged and the hydrogen&#8208;bond donor more positively charged and hence suppressing the donor&#8211;acceptor charge transfer interaction between the interacting fragments. This, ultimately, hampers the cooperativity in the hydrogen&#8208;bonded macrocycle. We envision that these findings could open the door to new design principles for the development of novel hydrogen&#8208;bond supramolecular macrocycles.

         <title>Organocatalytic Asymmetric Reduction of &#948;&#8208;Nitro Dienes: a Viable Entry to Functionalized Amines and Highly Substituted Enantioenriched Cyclopentanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new asymmetric organocatalytic reaction to afford enantioenriched &#948;&#8208;nitro alkene analogues and their synthetic manipulation are presented. The chiral nitro alkene was further used in a stereoselective cyclization reaction to afford an almost enantiomerically pure highly functionalised cyclopentane featuring five contiguous stereocenters.







Abstract
&#948;&#8208;nitro dienes were successfully synthesized and converted to &#948;&#8208;nitro alkenes with complete chemo and regioselectivity. The enantioselective organocatalytic reduction was also accomplished and afforded the product in up to 97&#8201;% e.e. The chiral nitro alkene was further elaborated and employed as starting material in a stereoselective cyclization reaction that led to an almost enantiomerically pure highly functionalised cyclopentane featuring 5 contiguous stereocenters.

         <title>Two Synthesis Approaches of the 2H&#8208;Tetrahydro&#8208;4,6&#8208;dioxo&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazine Ring System of Alchivemycins A and B</title>

         <dc:description>
The 2H&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;4,6&#8208;dioxo&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazine (TDO) ring model of alchivemycins, an unprecedented structural motif in natural products, was synthesized via two routes. Both routes involved the intramolecular trapping of an acylketene intermediate by an internal hydroxy group as a key step. A DMAP&#8722;CaCl2&#8208;mediated O&#8208; to C&#8208;acyl migration reaction enabled installation of an acyl group at the C5 position of an unstable TDO intermediate.







Abstract
The 2H&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;4,6&#8208;dioxo&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazine (TDO) ring, a rare structural motif embedded in the molecular architecture of alchivemycins, is synthesized from 2,2,6&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxin&#8208;4&#8208;one via two routes. Both routes involve the intramolecular trapping of an acylketene intermediate by an internal hydroxy group to form the TDO ring as a key step. The first synthesis was achieved in 29&#8201;% overall yield from the starting material by a four&#8208;step sequence featuring a DMAP&#8722;CaCl2&#8208;mediated O&#8208; to C&#8208;acyl migration reaction to install an acyl group at the C5 position of the TDO ring. The second synthesis was completed in 8&#8201;% overall yield from the same starting material as the first one through five steps by exploiting a photo&#8208;induced double bromination reaction.

     alt="Two Synthesis Approaches of the 2H-Tetrahydro-4,6-dioxo-1,2-oxazine Ring System of Alchivemycins A and B"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-tetrahydro-4,6-dioxo-1,2-oxazine (TDO) ring model of alchivemycins, an unprecedented structural motif in natural products, was synthesized via two routes. Both routes involved the intramolecular trapping of an acylketene intermediate by an internal hydroxy group as a key step. A DMAP&#8722;CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated O- to C-acyl migration reaction enabled installation of an acyl group at the C5 position of an unstable TDO intermediate.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-tetrahydro-4,6-dioxo-1,2-oxazine (TDO) ring, a rare structural motif embedded in the molecular architecture of alchivemycins, is synthesized from 2,2,6-trimethyl-4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-1,3-dioxin-4-one via two routes. Both routes involve the intramolecular trapping of an acylketene intermediate by an internal hydroxy group to form the TDO ring as a key step. The first synthesis was achieved in 29&#8201;% overall yield from the starting material by a four-step sequence featuring a DMAP&#8722;CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated O- to C-acyl migration reaction to install an acyl group at the C5 position of the TDO ring.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Tandem Oxidation&#8210;Organocatalyzed Aromatic C&#8210;S Bond Functionalization: Synthesis of 2&#8208;(Benzo[b]thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzenesulfonamide Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we demonstrated a visible light mediated tandem oxidation&#8210;organo catalyzed C&#8210;S bond functionalization protocol for the cleavage of aromatic C&#8210;S bond. The investigation encompassed the functionalization of C&#8210;S bonds within sulfones, sulfoxides, and aliphatic sulfide derivatives. However, the process of functionalizing the C&#8210;S bond in aromatic sulfides remains uncertain. The presented protocol demonstrates the C&#8210;S bond functionalization on benzo[b]benzo[4,5]thieno[2,3&#8208;d]thiophene derivative and amines including primary and secondary amines as well. A radical mediated mechanism was proposed for the tandem oxidation&#8210;organocatalyzed C&#8210;S bond functionalization protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to secondary amines via the hydrogen auto&#8208;transfer reaction mediated by KOtBu</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have unveiled here an N&#8208;alkylation reaction of amines by alcohols via hydrogen auto&#8208;transfer. Unlike other catalytic systems containing transition metals or additives, potassium tertiary butoxide was found to be a unique and effective catalyst for synthesizing secondary amines. The role of the K+ ion and the reaction intermediates were studied under control experiments and by theoretical calculations. The reaction was found to be general and tolerates a series of functional groups providing a convenient method to synthesize N&#8208;alkylated compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>The influence of acceptor acidity on hydrogen bond mediated aglycone delivery (HAD) through the picoloyl protecting group.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The outcome of glycosylation reactions heavily relies on the specific protecting group patterns employed on both the donor and acceptor molecules. The picoloyl (Pico) protecting group stands out as it can steer the stereoselectivity in a glycosylation reaction through hydrogen bond&#8208;mediated aglycone delivery (HAD). This provides syn&#8208;stereoselectivity, with respect to the stereochemistry of the Pico group, by forming a hydrogen bond between the incoming acceptor and the picoloyl ring nitrogen. We here probe how acceptor acidity influences the stereodirecting effect of the picoloyl protecting group. A set of 3&#8208;O&#8208;functionalized glucosyl and mannosyl donors, each bearing different protecting groups (picolinate, nicotinate, isonicotinate, and benzoate), were synthesized for systematic evaluation. For the 3&#8208;O&#8208;picoloyl&#8208;glucose series, the picoloyl group exhibited minimal influence on stereoselectivity, with only weak nucleophiles showing a modest shift in selectivity for the 3&#8208;O&#8208;Pico protected glucosyl donor in comparison to the other C&#8208;3&#8208;acyl glucosides. In contrast, in the 3&#8208;O&#8208;picoloyl&#8208;mannose series a much stronger &#946;&#8208;directing effect was observed, wherein more acidic acceptors led to increased &#946;&#8208;selectivity. The results provide insights into the complex interplay of acceptor acidity and glycosylation stereoselectivity mediated by the picoloyl protecting group.</dc:description>

We here probe how acceptor acidity influences the stereodirecting effect of the picoloyl protecting group. A set of 3-O-functionalized glucosyl and mannosyl donors, each bearing different protecting groups (picolinate, nicotinate, isonicotinate, and benzoate), were synthesized for systematic evaluation. For the 3-O-picoloyl-glucose series, the picoloyl group exhibited minimal influence on stereoselectivity, with only weak nucleophiles showing a modest shift in selectivity for the 3-O-Pico protected glucosyl donor in comparison to the other C-3-acyl glucosides. In contrast, in the 3-O-picoloyl-mannose series a much stronger &#946;-directing effect was observed, wherein more acidic acceptors led to increased &#946;-selectivity.

         <title>Bifunctional Iodoazolium Salts: Searching for Cooperation Between Halogen Bonding and Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;covalent interactions play an important role in all sub&#8208;fields of chemistry, including catalysis, where interactions of different natures can work together to improve reactivities and selectivities. Several families of molecules that incorporate both hydrogen bond (HB) and halogen bonding (XB) donors have already been studied. However, there is a lack of data on how grafting HB donors to iodoazolium salts could impact their association and reactivity properties. Herein, we disclose the synthesis of a library of iodoazolium salts bearing varied HB donors, along with a study of their physico&#8208;chemical properties using different techniques (X&#8208;ray diffraction, 31P NMR, ITC) and their behavior in catalysis. Even though no clear&#8208;cut evidence of cooperation between XB and HB could be obtained through physico&#8208;chemical evaluations, a iodoazolium salt bearing a urea function displayed better conversion and product selectivity in a Ritter reaction than all other activators lacking one or the other function.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Responsive Spiroborate&#8208;Based Assemblies of Podand&#8208;type Ligands Functionalized with Two Terminal/Peripheral Catecholate Moieties in the Presence of Alkali Cations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of two ligands bearing two terminal catecholate binding sites connected by an oligo(ethyleneglycol) bridge of two distinct lengths and their self&#8208;assembly upon boron coordination and alkali cation binding (M = Li, Na, K, Cs) are reported. Attempts to synthesize positional isomers of the ligands are also described. Binding of the four alkali cations M+ through M&#8208;O interactions was studied depending on the length of the oligo(ethyleneglycol) chain in solution by 1H and DOSY NMR, Mass spectrometry (MS) and in the solid&#8208;state by X&#8208;Ray diffraction (XRD) on single crystals. MS spectrometry as well as 1H NMR revealed the presence of monomeric and oligomeric spiroborate compounds. Two monomeric macrocycles could be characterized by XRD, entrapping either lithium or cesium cations within the spiroborate macrocycle.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A review on the carbofluorination of &#960;&#8208;bonds and related transformations involving tandem C&#8722;C/C&#8722;F bond forming reactions is presented. The application of electrophilic fluorine and nucleophilic fluoride reagents in this chemistry is described, as well as recently developed protocols involving the use of fluorinated organic molecules in atom&#8208;economic carbofluorination reactions.







Abstract
Due to the unique properties of C&#8722;F bonds, organofluorine compounds occupy a privileged space in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and polymer industries. Carbofluorination reactions involve the formation of a C&#8722;C and a C&#8722;F bond, typically across a &#960;&#8208;bond or another unsaturated functionality that is revealed upon in situ activation. The design of tailored substrates and new catalyst systems has enabled carbofluorination chemistry to emerge as a promising manifold for the synthesis of unique fluorinated scaffolds. This review covers the application of nucleophilic and electrophilic fluorinating reagents in this chemistry, in addition to recently developed atom&#8208;economical carbofluorination reactions using organofluorine compounds as dual reagents.
