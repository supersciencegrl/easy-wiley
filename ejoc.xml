         <title>Controllable Synthesis of Mono&#8208; and Bis&#8208;sulfenylindoles from Indoles and Various Sulfenylation Agents Using KI/SeO2 System</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 38, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for selective and controllable sulfenylation of indoles to synthesize mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;sulfenylindoles was reported by using a novel aerobic catalytic oxidation system KI/SeO2 for sulfenylation of indoles with disulfide/thiols. The method is scalable, not sensitive to moisture, and can proceed without metal catalyst.







Abstract
An efficient method for selective synthesis of mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;sulfenylindoles was developed using a novel aerobic catalytic oxidation system KI/SeO2 for sulfenylation of indoles with disulfide/thiols. The selectivity was controlled by varying the amount of the catalytic system and sulfenylation agents. The reaction features easy operation, mild reaction conditions, good atom economy, gram&#8208;scalability, and a metal&#8208;free approach furnishing desired products in up to excellent yields.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions and Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis: A Convenient Blend</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 38, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The most recent applications and possibilities of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions on solid phase are reviewed, which is a practical and fast strategy to cover current organic chemistry demands. Remarkably, solid&#8208;phase CuAAC and ring&#8208;closing metathesis have demonstrated an important role in synthetic biology, while more traditional Pd&#8208;catalyzed reactions, like Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura, Heck, and Sonogashira reactions, are valuable tools for accessing libraries of bioactive compounds.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed, C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming reactions have made an enormous impact in the way complex molecules are assembled. The benefits of solid&#8208;phase chemistry soon made this type of reaction applicable to solid&#8208;supported processes. In this review, we report the most recent applications and possibilities of this combination. Remarkably, the solid&#8208;phase CuAAC and ring&#8208;closing metathesis have demonstrated an important role in synthetic biology, alike more traditional Pd&#8208;catalyzed reactions, such as Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura, Heck, Sonogashira, which are valuable tools for accessing libraries of biologically relevant small molecules. Examples proved the validity of solid&#8208;phase transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions as a practical and fast strategy to cover the current organic chemistry demands.

         <title>Structure &#8211; Bioactivity Relationship in Cyclic Peptoids: An Overview</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 38, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic peptoids display remarkable biological activity thanks to their constitution and functionalization. This Review provides a systematic description of the bioactivities discovered so far, together with a complete structure&#8208;function relationship rationalization. Utilizing a strategic design for the synthesis of cyclic peptoids represents the starting point for further developments of these peptidomimetics as drug candidates.







Abstract
Cyclic N&#8208;substituted glycines oligomers, also known as cyclic peptoids, constitute a promising class of novel peptidomimetics, capable of simulating bioactive effectors with enhanced proteolytical stability and cell permeability as crucial bonuses. The macrocyclic constraint, essential for the induction of stable secondary structures, determines the biomimetic potential of such molecules, which act as antimicrobials, cytotoxic agents, siderophores, glycosidases inhibitors and so on. The bioactivity can be either attributed to the macrocyclic core (especially chelation) or to the side&#8208;chains (when endowed with specific groups or pharmacophores). The structure&#8208;bioactivity correlations emerging for this class of peptidomimetics, based on the study of conformational order and morphology of the backbone architecture, unravel interesting avenues for the rational design of more effective cyclooligomeric biomimics.

The Front Cover shows a panorama from the so&#8208;called Path of the Gods, a hiking trail in Southern Italy. At the end of the strenuous journey, the trekker is rewarded with a wonderful view of the Amalfi coast. The path to developing (cyclic) peptoids as therapeutic agents is still an uphill hike, but the tremendous advances made in the last few decades in terms of both varied biological activity and structural diversity make them a rather promising class of peptidomimetic drug candidates. More information can be found in the Review by Assunta D'Amato.

The Cover Feature represents the &#8220;factory of molecules&#8221; using transition&#8208;metal catalysis on solid&#8208;phase synthesis. The transition metals are responsible for the assembly of solid&#8208;supported substrate, in this case, to the corresponding &#8220;free&#8221; fragment. Finally, the cleavage process releases the pure compound at the end of the production line. Cover design by Patricia&#8197;G. Cornier. More information can be found in the Research Article by Ernesto&#8197;G. Mata et&#8197;al.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Indirect C&#8722;F Activation of 3&#8208;Perfluoroalkyl Indoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 38, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for activating the &#945;&#8208;CF2&#8208;group of 3&#8208;perfluorobutyl&#8208;1H&#8208;indoles without catalyst is presented, enabling the preparation of fluorine&#8208;containing 3&#8208;substituted&#8208;2&#8208;phenylindoles, which are preferred structures for medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
We present a catalyst&#8208;free method for indirect C&#8722;F activation of a perfluorinated side chain in C(3) position of 1H&#8208;indoles with moderate to good yields, which allows the introduction of a nucleophile at the &#945;&#8208;CF2&#8208;group of the perfluorinated chain. By adapting this approach, it is also possible to modify 3&#8208;perfluorobutyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;indole to generate privileged structures for medicinal chemistry.

         <title>We Need to Talk about Kekul&#233;: The 150th Anniversary of the Benzene Structure</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 38, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2022 is a more appropriate year than 2015 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Kekul&#233; benzene structure, for in 1865 Kekul&#233; did not propose the familiar hexagonal 1,3,5&#8208;cyclohexatriene formulation. Why did he not?







Abstract
Although the paper published by Kekul&#233; in 1865 is generally accepted as the seminal document regarding the elucidation of the structure of benzene, it was not for another seven years that Kekul&#233; introduced a &#8220;collision theory&#8221; which, in his view, made the 1,3,5&#8208;cyclohexatriene formulation at last acceptable. 2022 is therefore an appropriate year to celebrate the 150th anniversary of his proposal. The present Perspective focusses in particular on how Kekul&#233;&#8217;s mind has evolved during that short period of time. After a short introduction, followed by a historical note about the emergence of aromatic chemistry and the role of Kekul&#233; as founder of structural organic chemistry, this Perspective discloses in three chapters the step&#8208;by&#8208;step unveiling of the 1,3,5&#8208;cyclohexatriene structure and focusses on Kekul&#233;&#8217;s own dubiety about this formula. Eventually, in 1872 Kekul&#233;&#8217;s benzene saga is completed in the article in which he discloses his final theory on the structure of benzene. In the last section, a short review is presented on the later quest for a fully symmetric single&#8208;formula representation of benzene.

         <title>Zn&#8208;Mediated Reductive Addition of Isocyanides with Unactivated Tertiary Alkyl Oxalates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 38, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient radical cascade cyclization protocol for the reductive cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds followed by phenanthridine formation is reported. The method involves generating tertiary alkyl radical intermediates that are invoked by single&#8208;electron reduction by Zn, wherein MgCl2 serves as the indispensable additive and nickel as the promoter. The reaction displays excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope.







Abstract
A facile and efficient method is presented for the synthesis of 6&#8208;alkylated phenanthridine, possessing hindered quaternary carbon centers, by Zn&#8208;mediated reductive trapping of tertiary alkyl radicals with both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient aryl isocyanides using nickel as a promoter. Bench&#8208;stable and operation&#8208;friendly tertiary alkyl oxalates derived from abundant tertiary alkyl alcohols were first used as radical precursors for the alkylation of isocyanobiphenyl species. This reaction displays excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope, allowing access to desired products in good to excellent yields.

         <title>Synthesis of Non&#8208;anomeric Spiro&#8208;Fused Bicyclic Sugar Derivatives by Light&#8208;Mediated 1,5&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) Process</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and efficient synthesis for the construction of the complex non&#8208;anomeric spiro&#8208;fused bicyclic sugar derivatives from glycosyl 6&#8208;trichloroacetimidates under visible light conditions was developed. The overall reaction proceeds via in&#8197;situ generation of imidate nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals followed by 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer to form the intramolecular carbon&#8208;nitrogen (C&#8722;N) bond.







Abstract
We report a metal&#8208;free, diastereoselective approach for the syntheses of conformationally locked spiro bicyclic sugars bearing a quaternary center at C5 position. The oxazoline&#8208;containing spiro&#8208;bicyclic system has been built in one step from easily synthesizable C6&#8208;glycosylimidates under visible light conditions. The overall transformation proceeds with the formation of an intramolecular C&#8722;N bond through the activation of appropriately positioned C&#8722;H bond via in&#8197;situ generation of an imidate nitrogen radical followed by an intramolecular 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) in the presence of NaI/PIDA reagents. Mild reaction conditions, green source of energy, broad substrate scope, scale&#8208;up synthesis, and high reaction yields are some of the key features of the developed protocol.

The Cover Feature represents the Antioxidant &#8211; &#8220;Antiox&#8221; &#8211; like an eccentric figure, because of its quality of donating what is yours, and personifies the naphthoquinone polyphenols in the paper. The &#8220;Thief&#8221; is the free radical and the &#8220;Female figure&#8221; describes atoms with all the electrons and healthy cells. In the action, the antioxidant offers an electron to the frightened thief, preventing him from stealing the woman&#8242;s bag full of electrons, who holds it tightly. The crowd of passersby, all with electrons overhead, represents other atoms. In the background, fragments of the reaction developed are shown.

         <title>Aza&#8208;oxyallyl Cations and Their Applications in (3+m) Cycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aza&#8208;oxyallyl cations, as proposed by Sheehan in the 1960s have garnered significant attention among the synthetic organic community, owing to their diverse reactivity profile for constructing N&#8208;scaffolds of biological interest. During its initial growth, aza&#8208;oxyallyl cations were used effectively as a 3&#8208;unit synthon as 1,3 dipoles to create N&#8208;heterocycles via cycloaddition reactions, wherein aza&#8208;oxyallyl cation served as electrophilic counterpart. Recently, new variations of aza&#8208;oxyallyl cations reactivity have been reported, including its usage as a 1,4 dipole in cycloaddition reactions, domino reactions, and the unique alkylating ability of heteroatoms. This review article provides an update of the recent developments in this area and the prevailing mechanistic insight.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Resorcin[4]arenes are not as extensively studied as their sister compounds, calix[4]arenes, owing to challenges in synthetic methodologies for their derivatization from the perceptive of molecular economy. In this tutorial review, we briefly illustrate the summary of their access methodologies together with their limitations, focusing at the derivatization of the ortho&#8208;positions in the upper rim. We hope to spark a refreshed surge in the development of these derivatization strategies, allowing access to novel molecules and futuristic applications, putting resorcin[4]arenes at the center stage of research for which they were meant.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a direct, multicomponent approach to an important class of fused&#8208;ring heterocycles, namely, imidazo[2,1&#8208;  b  ]thiazole derivatives starting from simple and readily available building blocks (  N  &#8208;Boc&#8208;  N  &#8208;propargylthiazol&#8208;2&#8208;amines, carbon monoxide, a secondary amine, and oxygen). The process takes place under the catalysis of the simple PdI  2  /KI system under relatively mild conditions (100 &#176;C under 20 atm of a 4:1 mixture of CO&#8208;air), and leads to 2&#8208;(imidazo[2,1&#8208;  b  ]thiazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208;  N  ,  N  &#8208;dialkylacetamides in yields up to 87%. The mechanistic pathway leading to carbonylated imidazo[2,1&#8208;  b  ]thiazole occurs through an ordered sequence of steps, involving amine&#8208;induced  N  &#8208;deprotection, oxidative aminocarbonylation of the triple bond (with C  sp  &#8210;H activation and formation of a 2&#8208;ynamide intermediate), dearomative cyclization (by intramolecular conjugate addition of thioazolic nitrogen to the 2&#8208;ynamide moiety) and aromatization by proton&#8208;shift isomerization.

         <title>Unravelling the Mechanism of Nickel Mediated Cross&#8208;ElectrophileElectrophile Coupling Between Katritzky Salts and Acid Chlorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modern nickel&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;electrophile coupling reactions devoid of organometallic nucleophiles have garnered a great deal of interest due to their ability to enhance functional group compatibility. Despite the recent advances in the &#64257;eld, various mechanistic pathways, such as radical chain and sequential oxidative addition, in addition to finding the active nickel species and reductant, render the reaction complex. Although the reduction of Ni(II) complexes by heterogeneous Mn could produce either Ni(I) or Ni(0) species, the latter is more generally proposed as an active species. Likewise, Ni(I) mediated reduction of pyridinium salts is commonly invoked to generate the transient alkyl radicals. In stark contrast, we present a comprehensive mechanistic examination and experimental evidence for the intermediacy of Ni(I) species, a synergistic reduction of pyridinium salts by Ni(I) and Mn. Using a combination of kinetic analysis, control experiments, and spectroscopic methods, the rate&#8208;limiting reductive alkylation and resting state Ni(II) species have been identified.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Modern nickel-mediated cross-electrophile coupling reactions devoid of organometallic nucleophiles have garnered a great deal of interest due to their ability to enhance functional group compatibility. Despite the recent advances in the &#64257;eld, various mechanistic pathways, such as radical chain and sequential oxidative addition, in addition to finding the active nickel species and reductant, render the reaction complex. Although the reduction of Ni(II) complexes by heterogeneous Mn could produce either Ni(I) or Ni(0) species, the latter is more generally proposed as an active species. Likewise, Ni(I) mediated reduction of pyridinium salts is commonly invoked to generate the transient alkyl radicals. In stark contrast, we present a comprehensive mechanistic examination and experimental evidence for the intermediacy of Ni(I) species, a synergistic reduction of pyridinium salts by Ni(I) and Mn. Using a combination of kinetic analysis, control experiments, and spectroscopic methods, the rate-limiting reductive alkylation and resting state Ni(II) species have been identified.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Dealkylation of Benzamides in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable, light&#8208;induced N&#8208;dealkylation of tertiary and secondary benzamides bearing primary alkyl substituents at the N&#8208;atom is described. The developed reactions take place in an aqueous environment under mild conditions and do not require the presence of surfactants. They can be carried out not only under irradiation with blue LEDs but also under sunlight.







Abstract
The N&#8208;dealkylation reactions of benzamides occur naturally in living organisms but chemical methods remain poorly developed. So far, light&#8208;induced variants of these processes have been restricted to amides containing secondary N&#8208;alkyl groups or required pre&#8208;functionalization of the starting material. Here, we present a direct, controllable N&#8208;dealkylation of tertiary and secondary benzamides possessing primary alkyl substituents at N&#8208;atom. The developed strategy operates in aqueous environment under mild conditions involving either blue LEDs or sunlight irradiation. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate two&#8208;step oxidation and the intermediacy of radicals at &#945;&#8208;position to N&#8208;atom. Selectivity in N&#8208;dealkylation of homo&#8208; and heterosubstituted tertiary benzamides is also investigated.

         <title>Second Generation Self&#8208;Assembling Dendrimer Combining Supramolecular and Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A second&#8208;generation self&#8208;assembling dendrimer combining supramolecular chemistry and dynamic covalent chemistry has been prepared using orthogonal binding motifs. The first shell is attached by heteroleptic zinc complexes, where the core is carrying bulky substituents. The second sphere is attached by oxime formation.







Abstract
A monodisperse second generation self&#8208;assembled dendrimer has been obtained combining supramolecular chemistry and dynamic covalent chemistry as orthogonal binding moieties. A branching unit 18 and a core 5 were connected via a heteroleptic terpyridine zinc complex exploiting the sterical hindrance of mesitylene units in the 6,6&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;position of one of the terpyridines as the distinction between the ligands. Solubility problems could be solved by introduction of an ethylhexyl ether. The final sphere of the dendrimer was connected via imines, hydrazones and oximes, whereby the oxime made from O&#8208;methylhydroxylamine (22) led to a complete turnover of all aldehyde functions. Furthermore, no amine signal was left and also no signals for a diffusion constant of the hydroxylamine 22 were observed. The successful formation of the dendrimers was analyzed by 1H NMR and DOSY NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore both, the first and second generation dendrimers could be detected by ESI HRMS.

         <dc:description>Glycoamino acids and glycoproteins, especially C&#8208;glycoamino acids and C&#8208;glycoproteins, attract tremendous interests in the realm of biology and chemistry due to their wide occurrence in natural products, excellent pharmacodynamic properties and dynamic stability. Compared with the traditional construction of the amino acid or the glycosyl moiety de novo, post&#8208;modification of amino acids and peptides through direct glycosylation reactions constitute a powerful synthetic approach to attaining C&#8208;glycoamino acids and C&#8208;glycopeptides rapidly on account of the high step&#8208;economy, broad functional group tolerance, and conservation of the chirality of the amino acid and glycosyl moieties. In this review, the recent developments in the synthesis of C&#8208;glycoamino acids and C&#8208;glycopeptides via the post&#8208;modification of amino acids and peptides are summarized. Additionally, the important and representative examples, synthetic applications, and crucial mechanism investigations of these glycosylation reactions are also highlighted.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An environmentally friendly and efficient electrochemical fluoroselenation reaction of olefins has been developed. With the use of commercially available diaryl diselenides, triethylamine trihydrofluoride, and olefins, a diverse array of &#946;&#8208;fluoroselenides could be readily obtained. The reaction conditions are mild, tolerating a wide range of substrates in excellent yields and selectivity, and can be easily extended to gram&#8208;scale preparation of vicinal fluoroselenides, too.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C Bond Formations on Alkenes: Insight into the Recent Enantioselective Developments</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The review summarizes the advances in the catalytic enantioselective mono&#8208; and difunctionalization of alkenes, highlighting the fundamental role of the ligands. Several types of asymmetric reactions have been developed involving different bonds formation, C&#8208;O, C&#8208;N and C&#8208;C, highlighting the urgency to go ahead in the search for new ligands and synthetic methodologies in order to improve the control over the reaction selectivity and activity and thus, to increase the applications in the synthesis of heterocyclic scaffolds and biologically active compounds. The review is divided into paragraphs, which take in consideration the type of bond formed during the nucleopalladation, C&#8208;O, C&#8208;N, C&#8208;C bond formation, the type of reaction involved.</dc:description>

         <title>Reppe&#8208;carbonylation of alkenes with carboxylic acids: A Catalytic and Mechanistic study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, a green&#8208;catalytic procedure is used to demonstrate the synthesis of long&#8208;chain anhydrides. This is accomplished via the carbonylation of alkenes with carboxylic acids. Anhydrides are important intermediates, finding specific applications as acetylation agents. The process is catalyzed by a Pd phosphine catalyst system in the presence of an acid promotor. Via optimization experiments, the importance of the phosphine ligand and acid promotor is demonstrated, without which the catalyst shows no activity. Although the yield was limited as a result of catalyst deactivation (42 %), to the best of our knowledge, the synthesis of long&#8208;chain anhydrides via this route have not been reported previously. It therefore represents a significant result. Isolation of the anhydrides were also successfully demonstrated, however, as a result of the sensitivity of the anhydrides to water, the isolated yields were much lower than the HPLC yield. Furthermore, a mechanistic study by means of HP&#8208;NMR (High Pressure Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectroscopy provided significant insights into the mechanism of the reaction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The oxidative rearrangement of indoles induced by various chemical oxidants is a frequently employed method for the construction of spirooxindole structures. Herein, we report an electrochemical method for the oxidative rearrangement of indoles to spirooxindoles in continuous flow. The electrochemical reactions require no chemical oxidants and can be scaled up easily without need for re&#8208;optimization of reaction conditions by passing more starting material through parallel reactors.</dc:description>

         <title>Trichloroisocyanuric Acid (TCCA): A Suitable Reagent for the Synthesis of Selanyl&#8208;benzo[b]chalcogenophenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe herein a new approach for the synthesis of 3&#8208;organoselanyl&#8208;benzo[  b  ]chalcogenophenes promoted by trichloroisocyanuric acid. The reaction was carried out with electrophilic selenium species which were generated  in situ  by the reaction between trichloroisocyanuric acid and diorganyl diselenides using ethanol as solvent. The developed method uses mild reaction conditions and was efficient for the synthesis of different 3&#8208;organoselanyl&#8208;benzo[  b  ]chalcogenophenes in a good to excellent yields. Analysis of  77  Se NMR spectroscopy indicates that the electrophilic PhSeCl was formed  in situ  and a plausible reaction mechanism was proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Catalyzed Acyl&#8208;Group Exchange Reaction between Carboxylic Acids and an Aroyl Fluoride</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acyl fluorides show unique reactivity and stability, and the catalytic conversions using acyl fluorides as a divergent building block have recently attracted much attention and have been rapidly researched. Thus, a development of a new synthetic method of acyl fluorides is constantly demanded. Herein, we describe a phosphine&#8208;catalyzed acyl&#8208;group exchange reaction between carboxylic acids and an aroyl fluoride. A variety of acyl fluorides are directly obtained from carboxylic acids through a catalytic system composed of tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy  3  ) and 2,6&#8208;difluorobenzoyl fluoride. This report is the first example of utilizing an acyl fluoride as a deoxyfluorination reagent.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Understanding of Electrocatalytic Vinylcyclopropane Rearrangement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron&#8208;catalyzed reactions induced by electrochemical methods, i.e., electrocatalytic reactions, are a focus of interest in organic chemical synthesis. Since some electrolysis parameters (current, potential and coulomb amount) can be monitored and controlled and electrochemical measurement techniques are well established, we can obtain mechanistic insights into electron&#8208;catalyzed (electrocatalytic) reactions. Using these advantages, we have investigated radical cation vinylcyclopropane rearrangements. The desired rearrangement proceeded by a catalytic coulomb amount. The synthetic outcomes and electrochemical measurements suggested that the rearrangement proceeded at the anode region via a radical cation chain mechanism. The key to the electrocatalytic rearrangement was the structure of the substrate.</dc:description>

         <title>Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienaym&#233; Multicomponent Reaction Catalysed by Reusable Br&#981;nsted&#8208;Acidic Ionic Liquids</title>

         <dc:description>
Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienaym&#233; multicomponent reactions can be efficiently catalysed by Br&#981;nsted acidic ionic liquids for the synthesis of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines and imidazo[2,1&#8208;b]thiazoles in moderate to excellent yields (42&#8211;93&#8201;%), either under thermal or microwave heating. The homogeneous acidic catalyst can be recycled and reused in four consecutive reaction cycles.







Abstract
In the present work, the use of Br&#981;nsted acidic ionic liquids (BAIL) as catalysts for Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienaym&#233; (GBB) multicomponent reactions was systematically investigated. A series of four 1&#8208;(butyl&#8208;4&#8208;sulfonic)&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium salts bearing different anions was easily prepared and screened as acidic catalysts for this transformation. The best reaction conditions were stablished as 20&#8197;mol&#8201;% of catalyst [(SO3H)4C4C1Im][OTf] in refluxing EtOH or MeOH under conventional heating and in sealed tube at 150&#8201;&#176;C for 1&#8211;4&#8197;hours under microwave heating, affording a series of imidazo&#8208;fused heterocycles in moderate to excellent yields (42&#8211;93&#8201;%). The homogeneous BAIL catalyst could be recycled and reused in four consecutive reaction cycles, despite of a laborious recovery procedure employed. This approach represents the first example of a task&#8208;specific reusable homogeneous Br&#981;nsted acidic catalyst in GBB reactions and opens new opportunities for the exploration of acidic ionic liquid phases as catalysts for this fascinating multicomponent reaction.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Free Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Mizoroki&#8208;Heck Reaction Strategy for the One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Functionalized Oxygen Heterocycles in Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligandless, telescoped, one&#8208;pot reductive Mizoroki&#8208;Heck reactions proceed smoothly and regioselectively in eco&#8208;friendly eutectic mixtures, and under aerobic conditions to yield 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl THF or THP derivatives in up to 95&#8201;% yield. Key intermediates have also been targeted in DES en route to pharmacologically relevant molecules.







Abstract
A Deep Eutectic Solvent, choline chloride/glycerol (1&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;mol&#8201;mol&#8722;1), proved to be an effective and sustainable reaction medium to promote telescoped, one&#8208;pot Mizoroki&#8208;Heck cross&#8208;coupling/reduction processes between 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran or 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran and several (hetero)aryl halides to easily access valuable 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl tetrahydrofuran (THF) or tetrahydropyran derivatives in up to 95&#8201;% yield. Notably, the whole transformation takes place under aerobic conditions, in the absence of additional ligands, and with a good substrate scope. The practicability of the method is also exemplified by the sustainable synthesis of two key THF derivatives, which are side chains of pharmacologically relevant inhibitors of Kv1.2 channel.

         <title>Probing Electron Transfer Events in Radical Cation Cycloadditions: Intramolecular vs. Intermolecular</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although radical ion chain pathways have long been recognized in the field of synthetic organic chemistry and are expected to be operative in various reactions, it is somewhat complicated to verify their involvement, since counting the number of electrons is not straightforward. Herein, a series of bis&#8208;styrenes is designed and synthesized to investigate electron transfer events by using radical cation [4 + 2] cycloadditions as probes. It is demonstrated that the intramolecular single electron transfer seems to be ineffective, while the intermolecular variants are highly effective. Therefore, a truly catalytic amount of electricity is enough for full conversions, confirming that chain pathways were definitely involved.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;H Alkylation of Glycine Derivatives: A Straightforward Strategy for Diverse &#945;&#8208;Unnatural Amino Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modification of glycine is the one of the most straightforward strategy to access diverse unnatural amino acids. This review outlines an overview of recently developed transformations employing radical&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H alkylation of N&#8208;aryl glycine derivatives.







Abstract
Unnatural amino acids are important scaffolds for novel drug candidates, and especially &#945;&#8208;alkyl amino acids have emerged as a valuable variant. This is due to the ubiquity of alkyl groups, which are pervasive as key motifs in natural products, biological and pharmaceutical molecules. The development of radical&#8208;based approaches in organic synthesis has expanded dramatically in recent years. It has enabled site&#8208; and region&#8208;specific installation of a variety of functionalities in small molecules, which has been spontaneously applied in the preparation of versatile amino acid building blocks. The glycine motif in the backbone of amino acids has gained significant attention for allowing access to a variety of complex &#945;&#8208;unnatural amino acids via radical&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H alkylation. This review summarizes the last decade's development of radical&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H alkylation of glycine derivatives to provide unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acids. The advantages, current limitations, and perspectives of glycine&#8208;based unnatural amino acid synthesis are also discussed.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of a Pyrrolizidinone&#8208;Based hNK1 Antagonist through Reductive Ring Contraction of a Six&#8208;Membered Cyclic Nitronate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seven&#8208;step asymmetric synthesis of a potent hNK1 antagonist has been accomplished through a stereoselective reductive recyclization of a properly functionalized six&#8208;membered cyclic nitronate.







Abstract
A concise seven&#8208;step asymmetric synthesis of MSD's potent hNK1 antagonist containing a pyrrolizidinone core bearing two fluorine&#8208;substituted aryl groups was developed. The pyrrolizidinone unit was constructed by reductive recyclization of a properly functionalized cyclic nitronate, which was assembled by stereoselective [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of a nitroalkene with a vinyl ether bearing a Whitesell's chiral auxiliary group. The configuration of the hNK1 antagonist, which was previously suggested based on bioactivity data, was confirmed by X&#8208;ray analysis. The crystal structure features multiple weak interactions involving fluorine atoms that are also found in a complex with the hNK1 receptor simulated by molecular docking.

         <title>Protection and Transformation of Natural Products within Aqueous Metal&#8208;Organic Cages</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Encapsulation of natural products within Metal&#8208;Organic Cages can bring about new properties and reactivity. This review highlights recent examples of Metal&#8208;Organic Cages that protect or facilitate the transformation of natural products upon binding in aqueous media, and aims to provide an overview of the possibilities of these cages in this area.







Abstract
Natural products are central to the organic synthesis field and attract immense interest due to their biological activity and wide industrial use. However, many suffer from poor aqueous solubility, instability under certain conditions, or bear complex composition, limiting their investigation and derivatization. Metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs) are promising molecular receptors to solubilize in water, preserve, or transform natural products. This contribution features examples of MOCs that encapsulate naturally occurring compounds and synthetic congeners in aqueous media, protecting them from photodegradation or hydrolysis. We highlight cases of cages used as molecular vessels to promote chemical conversion and derivatization of natural substances. This review aims to provide an overview of the possibilities of using MOCs to bring about new properties and reactivity on natural products, offering methodological insights into cage operation for enhancing their activity and the engineering of further aqueous applications involving natural compounds, synthetic derivatives, and biomolecules.

         <title>Highly Selective Catalyst&#8208;Free Oxidative Synthesis of N&#8208;formamides From C2 &amp; C3 Feedstocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of bio&#8208;derived feedstocks as building blocks in organic syntheses holds great value with goals of high product yield and minimizing carbon loss. As contribution to this effort, present work explores 5 different C2 and C3 feedstocks (derived from biomass and conventional sources) such as glycerol (GLY), 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone (DHA), Ethylene glycol (EG), Glycolic acid (GLYAC) and Glyoxal (GLYOX) as carbon sources for highly selective, catalyst&#8208;free oxidative synthesis of N&#8208;formamides from primary and secondary amines. Both DHA and GLYOX showed the best carbon efficiency through carbon source: amine ratio of 1:2, resulting in 100% selectivity of N&#8208;formanilide with tert&#8208;butyl hydrogen peroxide (TBHP) as the oxidant. GLYOX was applied further for synthesizing a N&#8208;formamide library of 21 substrates exemplifying substantial yields ranging from 68&#8208;98%. Moreover, pilot scalability of this methodology achieved a yield of 87% and 72% for aniline substrate at 5&#8208;gram scale using GLYOX and DHA respectively in 24 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast Continuous Flow Photo&#8208;Thiol&#8208;Ene Functionalization of Conformation&#8208;Controlled Cinchona Alkaloids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe ultra&#8208;fast continuous flow photo&#8208;thiol&#8208;ene reactions on cinchona alkaloids derivatives through a control of the reactive conformation in solution. Flow thiol&#8208;ene reactions proceed at 32 &#176;C under light irradiation at 365 nm and require only 2.5 minutes of residence time to reach completion. The short path length of the tubular flow photochemical reactor, which maximizes and homogenizes the photon flux, associated to the fine tuning of the reactive conformation of cinchona alkaloids in solution are the main reasons for the high rates observed. The predominant conformation in solution of cinchona alkaloids was adjusted through the substitution of the hydroxyl group at C9 by a phenyl carbamate function.</dc:description>

         <title>Dibenziodolium Salts as Halogen Bond Donor Catalysts for Reduction of Quinolines, One&#8208;Pot Reductive Amination, and Addition Reaction with Indoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficiency of dibenziodolium salts as halogen bond donor catalysts was investigated by studying various organic transformations. Diverse reactions were carried out with low catalytic loading and under mild conditions. The catalyst was found to be efficient for carrying out the reduction of quinolines, one&#8208;pot reductive amination, Michael addition reaction of indoles with chalcones, and Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction of indoles with isatin with a low catalytic loading of 3 mol%. A wide substrate scope was attempted for all the transformations. Several control experiments were carried to rule out the possibility of hidden Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. NMR studies and preliminary DFT calculations suggest the presence of halogen bond between the catalyst and the substrate.</dc:description>

         <title>Domino Reactions through Recursive Anionic Cascades: The Advantageous Use of Nitronates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The evolving landscape of recursive nitronate cyclization, as a mechanistically distinct domino strategy employing nitroalkanes as dual&#8208;acting one&#8208;carbon lynchpins, is discussed in this review. Its advantageous use in rapid assembly of topologically diverse and functionally embellished carbo&#8208; and heterocycles is highlighted along with their applications in complex natural products synthesis.







Abstract
Recursive Anionic Cyclization (RAC) continues to proliferate as a mechanistically distinct domino strategy. Deployment of nitroalkanes as a source of recursive carbanions has created a niche operating space for generating molecular complexity and diversity. This new corollary i.&#8201;e. recursive nitronate cyclization is the basis of a domino [5&#8197;C+1&#8197;C] cyclization strategy wherein nitroalkanes act as one&#8208;carbon lynchpin, providing rapid access to topologically intriguing, densely functionalized carbo&#8208; and heterocycles embodying multiple chiral centers with regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Extension to aromatic domains, particularly via benzannulation reactions, has further consolidated the operating space. While leveraging the functional versatility of nitro group for post&#8208;domino modifications, such endeavors have culminated in total synthesis of diverse natural products. An incisive analysis of recursive nitronate cyclizations and their emergent potentials is delineated in this review. It is hoped that this focused narrative will enthuse and draw new practitioners to the arena to advance the field.

         <title>Pyrazine Alkylation with Aldehydes and Haloalkanes Using N,N&#8217;&#8208;Bis(trimethylsilyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyrazine Derivatives</title>

         <dc:description>
N,N&#8217;&#8208;Bis(trimethylsilyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyrazines serves as starting materials for introducing alkyl groups into the parent pyrazine skeletons upon combined with aldehydes and nBu4NF as well as electron&#8208;deficient alkyl halides. In this reaction, activation of the trimethylsilyl moiety by fluoride is the key step for generating electron&#8208;rich silicate intermediates, while reduction of electron&#8208;deficient alkyl halides by 1&#8201;a produces radical cation [1&#8201;a]&#8901;+ for further C&#8722;C bond formation.







Abstract
N,N&#8217;&#8208;Bis(trimethylsilyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyrazines are useful starting materials for synthesizing alkylpyrazines upon combination with aldehydes and tetra(n&#8208;butyl)ammonium fluoride. Various aryl, heteroaryl, and alkyl aldehydes are utilized as sources of the alkyl substituents; reactions with electron&#8208;rich aldehydes afford the corresponding alkylpyrazines in good yields. The overall reaction sequence was clarified by DFT calculations; in this reaction, activation of the N&#8208;trimethylsilyl moiety by fluoride, forming the electron&#8208;rich silicate intermediate Int&#8208;1, is the key step for the subsequent C&#8722;C bond formation with aldehydes, and the following 1,3&#8208;proton transfer from Int&#8208;3 to Int&#8208;4 is the rate&#8208;determining step. In addition, treatment of N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyrazines (1&#8201;a) with electron&#8208;deficient alkyl halides under fluoride&#8208;free conditions affords the corresponding alkylated pyrazines.

         <dc:description>Heterocycles fused to seven&#8208;membered rings are synthesized in a highly selective fashion from (2&#8208;alkynylphenyl) benzyl ethers by a consecutive potassium tert&#8208;butoxide&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot cyclization. Systematic study to determine the ideal conditions revealed that a catalytic amount of potassium tert&#8208;butoxide, dimethyl sulfoxide, and the tert&#8208;BuOK/tert&#8208;BuOH equilibrium can play a crucial role in the formation of products. The optimized reaction conditions were applied to 2&#8208;alkynylphenyl benzyl ethers containing substituted aromatic systems directly bonded to the triple bond; however, they were ineffective for alkynes having alkyl groups. The protocol afforded the heterocycles fused to seven&#8208;membered rings in good yields via an exclusive 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig/7&#8208;endo&#8208;dig one&#8208;pot sequence. The photophysical properties of compounds were investigated using absorption and emission fluorescence analyses. The emission analysis showed a blue to cyan emission. Large Stokes shift values were found for all compounds, which were attributed to the ICT state and the electronic properties of the substituents.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion Responsive Molecular Switch Based on a Doubly Strapped Calix[4]pyrrole</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chloride, acetate and benzoate anions binding with relatively low affinities are kinetically trapped between the straps within the cavity of a doubly strapped calix[4]pyrrole receptor. The complexation is accompanied by a conformational change of the host reminiscent of an insect being captured in a Venus flytrap.







Abstract
A calix[4]pyrrole receptor bearing two proximally meso&#8208;meso linking isophthaloyl straps displays open and closed states depending on the calix[4]pyrrole conformation. In the crystal structures and in non&#8208;polar solvent, the calix[4]pyrrole adopts open 1,3&#8208;alternate conformation with straps on the sides. Anion binding triggers a closed state of the receptor providing two types of interactions with an aromatic benzoate guest: hydrogen bonds from the pyrrolic NH groups and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions from the phenyl groups of the straps. Slow exchange dynamics was observed on the NMR timescale indicating that benzoate, acetate and chloride anions, which bind with relatively low affinity get kinetically trapped in the receptor as insects in a Venus flytrap.

         <title>Pt&#8208;WOx/C catalysts for &#945;, &#946;&#8208; unsaturated aldehydes hydrogenation: a NMR study of the effect of the reactant adsorption on activity and selectivity.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes is an ideal case for studying the structure&#8211;activity relationships in heterogeneous catalysis. In particular, cinnamaldehyde can be used as probe molecule for revealing the competition between hydrogenation of C=C and C=O bond. Here, we investigated the effect of the modification of some Pt supported on carbon catalysts by WO  x  species in cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation as WO  x  species are reported to increase the adsorption and activation of the C=O group of &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The selective hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated aldehydes is an ideal case for studying the structure&#8211;activity relationships in heterogeneous catalysis. In particular, cinnamaldehyde can be used as probe molecule for revealing the competition between hydrogenation of C=C and C=O bond. Here, we investigated the effect of the modification of some Pt supported on carbon catalysts by WO  x  species in cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation as WO  x  species are reported to increase the adsorption and activation of the C=O group of &#945;, &#946;-unsaturated aldehydes.

         <title>Double Prins Cyclisation Enabled Rapid Access to &#945;,&#969;&#8208;hydroxytetrahydropyrans</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The spiroketal moiety is an important substructure within many biological natural products. One method to access them is  via  the oxidative cyclisation of a pendant hydroxyl group on to a pre&#8208;formed pyran. However access to such precursors has hitherto been challenging and requires multistep syntheses frequently with considerable protecting group manipulation. Herein we report a novel and high yielding method for the preparation of hydroxydi&#8208; and hydroxytetra&#8208;hydropyrans, as spiroketal precursors, utilizing a novel double&#8208;Prins cyclisation approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoconvergent Synthesis of Cyclopentenyl Nucleosides by Palladium&#8208;Assisted Allylic Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stoichiometric Tsuji&#8208;Trost reaction of cyclopentenyl carbonates proceeds in stereoconvergent manner, selectively leading to cis configured nucleosides, regardless the relative configuration (cis or trans) of the starting substrates. As indicated by DFT calculations, the reaction outcome relies on the low activation energy related to the crucial, Pd&#8208;dependent &#960;&#8208;inversion step. This approach may represent a useful strategy for the synthesis of bioactive carbocyclic nucleosides.







Abstract
The Tsuji&#8208;Trost reaction of cyclopentenyl carbonates was explored by experimental studies and computational calculations, in search for the synthetic conditions enabling the stereoconvergent synthesis of cyclopentenyl nucleosides. Under common conditions, cyclopentenyl reagents provide Tsuji&#8208;Trost products only in a weakly stereoconvergent manner. However, changes in the amount of catalyst (up to 1 eq) affect either the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the reaction, selectively leading to cis configured cyclopentenyl N9&#8208;linked purine nucleosides, regardless the relative configuration (cis or trans) of the starting substrates. DFT studies clarified that this could be due to the low activation energy related to the crucial, Pd&#8208;dependent &#960;&#8208;inversion step.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydroaminoalkylation of Allenes and Methylenecyclopropanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,2,3&#8208;Trisubstituted cyclopropane products exhibiting a structurally interesting cis&#8208;orientation of all three cyclopropane hydrogen atoms and a 2&#8208;aminoethyl side chain are regio&#8208; and stereoselectively accessible by titanium&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminoalkylation reactions of bicyclic methylenecyclopropanes. In addition, synthetically promising allylamines can be obtained from 1,1&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allenes under comparable reaction conditions.







Abstract
Intermolecular hydroaminoalkylation reactions of 1,1&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allenes as well as methylenecyclopropanes with secondary amines can be achieved in the presence of a 2,6&#8208;bis(phenylamino)pyridinato titanium catalyst at 140&#8201;&#176;C within 2&#8211;8&#8197;h. Corresponding reactions of allenes with N&#8208;benzylanilines deliver branched allylamine products in very good yields (up to 83&#8201;%) and with branched&#8208;linear&#8208;ratios between 75&#8201;:&#8201;25 and 95&#8201;:&#8201;5. In contrast, bicyclic methylenecyclopropanes undergo hydroaminoalkylation with N&#8208;benzylanilines or N&#8208;alkylbenzylamines to give linear products in good to excellent yields (up to 98&#8201;%) with perfect regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The corresponding 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted (2&#8208;aminoethyl)cyclopropane products exhibit a structurally interesting cis&#8208;orientation of all three cyclopropane hydrogen atoms.

         <title>Ammonium Ferrate Catalyzed Cycloaddition of CO2 to Aziridines for the Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Oxazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simple ammonium ferrates are competent catalysts for the CO  2  coupling with aziridines to yield 5&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;oxazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones. Good yields, with remarkable selectivities are obtained under mild reaction conditions, room temperature and atmospheric CO  2  pressure, especially for non&#8208;hindered  N  &#8208;alkyl,  N  &#8208;benzyl and  N  &#8208;allyl aziridines, without the need of any co&#8208;catalyst. To shed light on the reaction mechanism, an extensive set of theoretical calculations has been carried out. A viable reaction mechanism involving just one ferrate molecule and where the rate determining step is the 1,3&#8208;oxazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one ring closure has been found, and the corresponding barrier is compatible with the experimental conditions tested in this study.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Catalyst&#8208;Free Access to Phthalazines: Entry to Antiviral Model Drugs via Merging Domino Reactions in One&#8208;Pot</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the development of a metal&#8208;free four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy to access high&#8208;value functionalized phthalazines using o&#8208;methyl benzophenones as starting compounds. Combining a light&#8208;mediated enolization of o&#8208;methyl benzophenones/Diels&#8208;Alder reaction domino process with a subsequent deprotection/aromatization domino reaction in one&#8208;pot leads to sustainable and efficient organic synthesis. The tangible advantages, i.e., absence of catalysts or additives, utilization of commercially available and/or easily accessible substrates, mild reaction conditions, simplicity, and single work&#8208;up procedure, make this combined process highly appealing for the direct construction of various 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;phthalazines. Importantly,  in vitro  bioactivity evaluation of these newly prepared heterocyclic compounds demonstrated a strong antiviral efficacy against major human pathogens like HCMV and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), innovation in antibacterial drug research and development is urgently needed and strongly encouraged by the World Health Organization (WHO). Carbohydrates are valuable bioactive scaffolds to be explored in this context, and because of their unique multifunctionality, stereochemical diversity, and natural protein&#8208;binding profile, they come across as attractive starting materials for the synthesis of antimicrobial agents with innovative mechanisms of action (MoA). In this concise review, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methodologies for the synthesis of an array of promising and recently developed carbohydrate&#8208;based molecules with antibacterial activity are presented and discussed. By describing successful case studies as platforms for the scrutiny of carbohydrate modification and coupling approaches in organic chemistry, this work summarizes the latest research efforts in this area, ultimately encouraging the design and synthesis of new and much&#8208;needed glycoantibiotic leads for pharmaceutical development.</dc:description>

By describing successful case studies as platforms for the scrutiny of carbohydrate modification and coupling approaches in organic chemistry, this work summarizes the latest research efforts in this area, ultimately encouraging the design and synthesis of new and much-needed glycoantibiotic leads for pharmaceutical development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Novel approaches to design glycan&#8208;based antibacterial inhibitors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interactions between bacterial lectins and carbohydrates on the host cell surface can mediate bacterial adhesion, invasion and immune evasion. Multivalency plays a key role in these binding events. However, additional molecular mechanisms greatly impact multivalent binding recognition. In order to develop specific and effective bacterial inhibitors, a deeper understanding of the complex underlying mechanisms of bacterial adhesion processes is necessary. By interfering with bacterial adhesion, synthetic multivalent glycoconjugates do not only have the potential to improve or replace antibiotic treatments, but also represent useful tools to study carbohydrate&#8208;pathogen interactions. In this review, we highlight a few recent advances in the synthesis and application of synthetic glycan&#8208;based scaffolds to uncover the nature of glycan&#8208;bacteria interactions and to design efficient bacterial inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Electrochemical Dibromination of Terpenes and Naturally Derived Olefins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective electrochemical dibromination method of terpenes and naturally derived olefins to functional intermediates has been established using bench&#8208;stable, inexpensive sodium bromide as bromine source at carbon&#8208;based electrodes.







Abstract
A simple electrochemical protocol is established for the selective alkene dibromination of naturally derived olefins, such as terpenes. The use of hazardous Br2 or its analogues have been elegantly avoided by employing readily available, inexpensive, and harmless sodium bromide with a dual role as reagent and supporting electrolyte in combination with sustainable carbon&#8208;based electrodes. This electrochemical protocol provides the desired products with good to excellent yields up to 82&#8201;% with 10 examples. Scalability has been proved by a 5&#8208;fold scale&#8208;up. Notably, higher yields and selectivity were achieved in comparison to conventional bromination by Br2 and DMSO/HBr system and the dibrominated compound was eligible for further functionalization, such as cyanation according to the Kolbe nitrile synthesis protocol.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydroarylation of Allenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroarylation of allenes leads to the selective formation of highly valuable allylic or vinylic structures through C&#8722;C bond formation. In this frame, transition metal&#8208;based catalysts have been broadly employed. This review highlights this topic, discussing advantages, limitations and mechanistic aspects of the related methods over the four last decades.







Abstract
The intermolecular transition&#8208;metal catalyzed hydroarylation of allenes has been widely explored since the early 1980s. This reaction allows the selective access to high&#8208;value allylic or vinylic motifs through the formation of C&#8722;C bonds. In this frame, arenes (ArH), which are employed without any pre&#8208;functionalisation, represent one of the most used families of aryl sources. Organoboronic derivatives (acids ArB(OH)2 and esters ArB(OR)2) constitute alternative, accessible and generally more reactive coupling partners, while aryl halides (ArX) are a third, less used type of aryl source. Whereas gold&#8208; and palladium&#8208;based catalysts are often used with arenes and aryl boronic derivatives, respectively, as aryl sources, a wide range of other transition metals have also been employed. Experimental and theoretical studies have often been reported, thus affording mechanistic insights and allowing to suggest catalytic cycles.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Rich Carbon Dots as Novel Nano&#8208;Aminocatalytic Platforms in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From N&#8208;containing molecular precursors to amine&#8208;rich CDs: a journey into sustainable and green opportunities for aminocatalytic methodologies. The analysis of the most explicative examples provides a panoramic view on the progress toward the preparation and application of amine&#8208;bearing CDs as catalysts for transformations of synthetical importance.







Abstract
The development of novel and effective metal&#8208;free catalytic systems, which can drive value&#8208;added organic transformations in environmentally benign solvents (for instance, water), is highly desirable. Moreover, these new catalysts need to be harmless, easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare, and potentially recyclable. In this context, amine&#8208;rich carbon dots (CDs) have recently emerged as promising nano&#8208;catalytic platforms. These nitrogen&#8208;doped nanoparticles, which show dimensions smaller than 10&#8197;nm, generally consist of carbon cores that are surrounded by shells containing numerous amino groups. In recent years, organic chemists have used these surface amines to guide the design of several synthetic methodologies under mild operative conditions. This Concept highlights the recent advances in the synthesis of amine&#8208;rich carbon dots and their applications in organic catalysis, including forward&#8208;looking opportunities within this research field.

Abstract
Functionalized 4,4&#8208;difluorospiro[2.2]pentan&#8208;1&#8208;yl derivatives are proposed as promising building blocks for synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Scalable, efficient, and diastereoselective approach to their preparation via the difluorocyclopropanation of (2&#8208;methylenecyclopropyl)methanol is developed. Stability of the title scaffolds towards common reaction conditions is confirmed by a series of typical functional group transformations. Physicochemical characteristics (pKa, logP, and aqueous solubility) and structural features of the key 4,4&#8208;difluorospiro[2.2]pentan&#8208;2&#8208;yl derivatives are established and compared with those of non&#8208;fluorinated analog, 2,2&#8208;difluorinated isomer, as well as monocyclic gem&#8208;difluorinated counterparts.

         <title>Aluminum&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Reduction of Heteroallenes Through Hydroboration: Amide/Thioamide/Selenoamide Bond Construction and C=X (X= O, S, Se) Bond Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented conjugated bis&#8208;guanidinate (CBG) stabilized aluminum dihydride, [LAlH 2 ; (L = {(ArNH)(ArN)&#8211; C=N&#8211;C=(NAr)(NHAr)}; Ar = 2,6&#8208; Et 2 &#8208;C 6 H 3 )] ( I ) catalyzed chemoselective hydroboration of heteroallenes such as carbodiimide (CDI)s, isocyanates, isothiocyanates, and isoselenocyanates is reported. A wide range of heteroallenes, including electron&#8208;donating and withdrawing groups, experience hydroboration to obtain selectively N&#8208;boryl amide, N&#8208;borylaminal, and N&#8208;boryl methyl amine products. More importantly, a single sustainable molecular aluminum&#8208;based catalyst effectively catalyzes CDIs, isocyanates, isothiocyanates, and isoselenocyanates into formamidines, formamides, thioformamides, and selenoformamides, respectively. Further, heteroallene substrates undergo hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), hydrodesulfurization (HDS), and hydrodeselenization (HDSe) reactions leading to N&#8208;boryl methyl amines. In addition, a series of control and kinetic experiments indicate that the aluminum hydride species are essential for all partial and complete reduction steps and breaking the C=X (X = O, S, and Se) bonds in heteroallenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical 1,3&#8208;Acyl Shifts in Natural Product Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical, sigmatropic 1,3&#8208;acyl shifts represent a powerful tool to construct quaternary carbon atoms and the backbones of complex natural products which cannot be constructed easily by conventional methods. The discussed applications of 1,3&#8208;acyl shifts in total syntheses highlight (i) the stereospecific reaction mechanism, (ii) the tolerance of versatile protecting groups, and (iii) their role in putative biosyntheses.







Abstract
Photochemical, sigmatropic 1,3&#8208;acyl shifts represent a powerful tool to construct quaternary carbon atoms and the backbones of complex natural products which cannot be constructed easily by conventional methods. This review highlights applications of 1,3&#8208;acyl shifts to elegant, partly biomimetic total syntheses of natural products by discussing the underlying photochemical equilibrium.

         <title>20&#960; Antiaromatic Isophlorins without Metallation or Core Modification
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, the synthesis of free&#8208;base (metal&#8208;free) isophlorins with 20&#960; antiaromatic character was achieved without core modification. The reduction of &#946;&#8208;tetracyanoporphyrins by hydrazine under aerobic conditions yielded isophlorins. These 18&#960; aromatic porphyrin/20&#960; antiaromatic isophlorin redox interconversions are reversible.







Abstract
Isophlorins (two&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced porphyrins) with 20&#960; antiaromaticity have been synthesized by metallation or core modification (replacing the inner NHs with less bulky atoms) thus far. The core&#8208;modification number (CMN) is an important factor for the stability of isophlorins against their oxidation to porphyrins. However, isophlorins with small CMN (&#8804;2), i.&#8201;e., without significant core modification, are difficult to synthesize and important for understanding their structure&#8211;antiaromaticity relationships. Herein, we report the synthesis of free&#8208;base (metal&#8208;free) antiaromatic isophlorins with no core modification (CMN=0) for the first time. &#946;&#8208;Tetracyanoporphyrins were successfully reduced by hydrazine to their corresponding isophlorins under aerobic conditions. These porphyrin/isophlorin transformations are reversible. Their structure and antiaromaticity were studied via 1H&#8197;NMR, UV&#8208;vis/near&#8208;infrared absorption spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction and theoretical calculations.

         <title>Multicomponent Functionalization of the Octreotide Peptide Macrocyclic Scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New octreotide analogs were prepared by replacing the disulfide bond with a functionalized tertiary lactam bridge. The on&#8208;resin approach includes an Ugi multicomponent macrocyclization that enables the simultaneous ring closure and incorporation of lipids, fluorophores and functional groups suitable for the subsequent conjugation to cytotoxic moieties.







Abstract
The replacement of the disulfide bridge by other types of side chain linkages has been a continuous endeavor in the development of cyclic peptide drugs with improved metabolic stability. Octreotide is a potent and selective somatostatin analog that has been used as an anticancer agent, in radiolabeled conjugates for the localization of tumors and as targeting moiety in peptide&#8208;drug conjugates. Here, we describe an on&#8208;resin methodology based on a multicomponent macrocyclization that enables the substitution of the disulfide bond by a tertiary lactam bridge functionalized with a variety of exocyclic moieties, including lipids, fluorophores, and charged groups. Conformational analysis in comparison with octreotide provides key information on the type of functionalization permitting the conformational mimicry of the bioactive peptide.

         <title>C&#8722;H Activation Based Functionalization of Furfural Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review summarizes the reported methods of direct C&#8722;H functionalization of furfurals without prior modification of the redox state of the aldehyde function. The aim is to illustrate the different approaches implemented for the functionalization of the C&#8722;H positions of the furan ring as well as of the aldehyde functional group.







Abstract
Furfural and related compounds are building blocks of industrial interest, obtained from raw biomass. Their use as precursors of basic and fine chemicals has gained increasing attention as a green alternative to petroleum&#8208;derived compounds. Several works have reported the functionalization of furfurals to obtain a wider range of chemicals, opening up new synthetic possibilities and applications, ranging from biofuels to pharmaceuticals. Among these works, processes based on C&#8722;H activation are the most attractive ones for their atom economy and the possibility to use non&#8208;activated substrates. This minireview summarizes the reported methods of direct C&#8722;H functionalization of furfurals without prior modification of the redox state of the aldehyde function. In particular, the transition metal catalyzed functionalization of each bond of the heteroaromatic nucleus of these molecules is systematically discussed, as well as examples of C&#8722;H transformations of the aldehyde function.

         <title>Calix[n]arenes in Action: Recent Applications in Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents an overview of the last ten years of advances in organic synthesis using calixarenes as organocatalysts. Calixarenes display a three&#8208;dimensional structure of a macrocycle that can be chemically modified to better act as a catalyst. They also are tolerant to aqueous or solvent&#8208;free systems, being recyclable and easy to separate from the reaction medium.







Abstract
The use of calix[n]arenes as organocatalysts has increasingly been considered a prime focus due to their adjustable three&#8208;dimensional molecular structure, easy synthesis, and versatile structural modification at the upper and lower edges. For instance, these macromolecules have been described as efficient catalysts for asymmetric aldol reactions, asymmetric Michael addition, esterification and transesterification, dehydration, nucleophilic aromatic substitution, and multicomponent reactions. Furthermore, calix[n]arenes also tolerate aqueous or solvent&#8208;free reaction systems and can be supported on solid and/or magnetic particles, showing cost, time and energy savings, easier experimental procedures, and chemical waste reduction.

         <title>Separation of the Thorpe&#8722;Ingold and Reactive Rotamer Effect by Using the Formation of Bicyclic Aziridinium Ions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A classic, angle dependent Thorpe&#8208;Ingold effect in the formation of bicyclic aziridinium ions is presented. Kinetic studies, backed up by SC&#8208;XRD and DFT calculations, reveal a linear correlation of the internal angle &#946; with the rate constant k1. Increased angles result in decreased rate constants and vice versa. The cyclic structure of the examined 3&#8208;chloropiperidines thereby excludes contribution of the reactive rotamer effect towards this cyclization.







Abstract
The geminal dialkyl effect is widely used in organic synthesis to promote cyclization reactions, although the exact origin of its rate enhancement remains unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate the applicability of this effect for the intramolecular formation of bicyclic aziridinium ions and assign it to angle contractions provided by introduction of sterically demanding substituents. Due to the cyclic structure of the examined 3&#8208;chloropiperidines the acceleration of this ring closure cannot be explained by an increased population of reactive gauche rotamers and therefore agrees with the original Thorpe&#8208;Ingold theory. Furthermore, introduction of strained aliphatic rings resulted in internal angle expansions and were accompanied by a preliminary decrease of rate constants for the investigated aziridinium ion formation. These results lead to a linear correlation between internal angle and relative reaction rate, supported by computational and X&#8208;ray crystallographic structural data.

         <title>Stereospecific Access to &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;Glycosylamine Derivatives by a Metal Free O&#8208;to&#8208;N [3,3]&#8208;Sigmatropic Rearrangement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycals substituted at C&#8208;3 with a carbamate group undergo, upon dehydration, a prompt allyl cyanate to isocyanate rearrangement to the isomeric N&#8208;glycosyl isocyanates, which give N&#8208;glycosyl carbamates and ureas by one&#8208;pot addition of alcohols or amines. The rearrangement occurs with complete stereoselectivity via a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic mechanism, affording &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;linked amines depending on the configuration at C&#8208;3 of the carbohydrate.







Abstract
Glycosylamine derivatives are biologically relevant compounds widespread in Nature, but the synthesis of this motif has been little addressed and its access with control of configuration at the anomeric carbon is challenging. Glycals substituted at C&#8208;3 with a carbamate group undergo, upon dehydration, a prompt allyl cyanate to isocyanate rearrangement to the isomeric N&#8208;glycosyl isocyanates, which can be conveniently trapped by one&#8208;pot nucleophilic addition with alcohols or amines to afford N&#8208;glycosyl carbamates and ureas, respectively. The rearrangement follows a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic pericyclic mechanism as illustrated by the stereospecificity of the reaction, with nitrogen being delivered at the anomeric position to the same face from which the oxygen at C&#8208;3 has departed. Thus, glucal and galactal give &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;glycosides exclusively while allal furnishes &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;glycosides. cis&#8208;Dihydroxylation of the synthesized unsaturated N&#8208;glycosides afford different 1&#8208;aminosugars with good selectivity.

         <title>Catechol&#8208;Functionalized Carbon Nanotubes as Support for Pd Nanoparticles: a Recyclable System for the Heck Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiwalled carbon nanotubes were highly functionalized with catechol moieties by means of a simple procedure involving the in&#8208;situ generation of the diazonium salt arising from the reaction between 4&#8208;aminocatechol and isoamyl nitrite. The resulting material was used to immobilize Pd nanoparticles obtaining an active and recyclable catalyst for the Heck reaction between methyl acrylate/styrene and aryl iodides.







Abstract
Carbon nanotubes have been covalently functionalized with catechol moieties through the formation of the corresponding aryl radicals obtained by reacting 4&#8208;aminocatechol with isoamyl nitrite. The functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes have been in turn used to immobilize Pd(II) ions on its surface forming catechol&#8208;Pd complexes, which were reduced to Pd nanoparticles (NPs). The so&#8208;obtained hybrid material has been characterized by means of thermogravimetric analysis coupled with differential scanning calorimetry (TGA&#8208;DSC), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This latter technique allowed to estimate the nanoparticle size (5.7&#177;2.8&#8197;nm) whereas a palladium loading of 20.3&#8197;wt&#8201;% has been found by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP&#8208;OES). The carbon nanotube&#8208;catechol&#8208;Pd hybrid was used as catalyst in two C&#8722;C coupling reactions, namely Suzuki and Heck reactions, resulting recyclable for at least 9 times in the latter process. During the reuse Pd nanoparticles increase their dimension to 19.3&#177;11.7&#8197;nm.

         <title>Polyazaacene and Cyclazaacene Precursors Synthesized by Dehydration Condensation from a Versatile Bis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diketone Unit Having an Anthracene Skeleton</title>

Herein, 8,11&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8201;:&#8201;8,11&#8208;diethanopentacene&#8208;2,3,9,10(1H,4H)&#8208;tetraone was used as a versatile compound for synthesizing polyazaacene and cyclazaacene precursors. This modular strategy provides a novel pathway for generating polyazaacene precursors of varying lengths and cyclazaacene precursors of various sizes for being assessed by the powerful on&#8208;surface chemistry.







Abstract
Azaacenes are acene analogs containing nitrogen atoms in their carbon&#8208;based molecular skeletons and are attracting significant attention because of their potential application in organic electronics. However, polyazaacenes have solubility and stability issues. In this study, we report a modular approach employing 8,11&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8201;:&#8201;8,11&#8208;diethanopentacene&#8208;2,3,9,10(1H,4H)&#8208;tetraone (1) as a key compound for &#960;&#8208;extension with commercially available materials to synthesize a series of polytetraazaacene thermal precursors. Exploiting this strategy, tetraazaheptacene, tetraazanonacene, and tetraazaundecacene precursors were successfully synthesized. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that the tetraazanonacene precursor can be converted to its corresponding tetraazanonacene in a nitrogen atmosphere. To extend the applicability of this method, compound 1 was also used to synthesize the cyclazaacene precursor at 0.8&#8201;% yield. This approach provides a new perspective for exploring the synthesis of polyazaacene and cyclazaacene precursors by using a crucial key compound via dehydration condensation reactions.

This approach provides a new perspective for exploring the synthesis of polyazaacene and cyclazaacene precursors by using a crucial key compound via dehydration condensation reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Oxazole&#8211;Tetrahydropyran Hybrids and Study on Their Antiproliferative Activity Against Human Tumour Cells</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a previously prepared lead compound, a new series of hybrid compounds was prepared and tested against six human tumour cell lines. These new triazole linked tetrahydropyran&#8211;oxazole hybrids were prepared evaluating the impact of the LogP for the proposed modifications. The compounds exhibited good antiproliferative results when compared with standards cisplatin and 5&#8208;fluorouracil.







Abstract
A series of triazole linked tetrahydropyran&#8211;oxazole hybrids was synthesized based on a previously reported lead compound with selective antiproliferative activity against human tumour cell lines. The series was prepared to evaluate the impact of LogP and different modifications in the activity, and the new compounds were assayed against A549, HBL&#8208;100, HeLa, SW1573, T&#8208;47D, and WiDr cell lines. Also, the potentiality to be P&#8208;gp substrate was tested. The compounds exhibited good antiproliferative results when compared with the standards cisplatin and 5&#8208;fluorouracil. In silico studies to evaluate pharmacokinetic properties using pkCSM software were also carried out.

         <title>Cyclobutane Formation by the Reaction of Ethenesulfonyl Fluoride with Dimethyl Diazomalonate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Attempts to synthesize fluorosulfonyl&#8208;substituted pyrazolines by Huisgen reactions (1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions) of dimethyl diazomalonate with ethenesulfonyl fluoride led to the formation of dimethyl (2R*,3S*,4R*)&#8208;2&#8208;(1,3&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxopropan&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;3&#8208;(fluorosulfonyl)&#8208;4&#8208;((fluorosulfonyl)methyl)cyclo&#173;butane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylate, a highly substituted cyclobutane derivative, which was characterized by NMR spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The mechanism of its formation was elucidated by carrying out the reaction at different temperatures and workup conditions. It is shown that an initial 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition yields a pyrazoline which extrudes nitrogen with formation of 1&#8208;fluorosulfonyl&#8208;2,2&#8208;bis(methoxycarbonyl)cyclopropane and dimethyl 2&#8208;(2&#8208;(fluorosulfonyl)ethylidene)malonate, the latter of which dimerized during chromatography on silica gel with formation of the isolated cyclobutane.</dc:description>

         <title>Expeditious Synthesis of a Glycopeptide Library</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new reactor design with optimized reaction conditions provides a route for glycopeptides synthesis within minutes by using equimolar quantities of glycosylated amino acids. This enabled the assembly of a proteoglycan&#8208;derived glycopeptide library in a matter of hours.







Abstract
Short proteoglycan fragments are of great importance for biochemical research. The solid&#8208;phase synthesis of such glycopeptides relies on excessive use of glycosylated amino acids, extended reaction times, and additional post&#8208;assembly deprotection protocols. We employed high&#8208;shear mixing for expedient and equimolar O&#8208;glycopeptide assembly. We further developed a stirring&#8208;based deprotection on the solid support, thus completing the synthesis of a glycopeptide library in a minimal amount of time and purification hurdles.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of a Bioactive Lignanamide Using a 5&#8208;endo&#8208;tet&#8208;Type Cyclization of Activated Cyclopropylcarbinols and Synthetic Support for the Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective total synthesis of a bioactive lignanamide with high enantiomeric excess was accomplished. The key synthetic steps include an organocatalytic enantioselective cyclopropanation and a Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated chirality&#8208;transferring 5&#8208;endo&#8208;tet&#8208;type cyclization of a D&#8722;A cyclopropylcabinol, which proceeds with a very high level of stereoinduction. Based on the obtained experimental evidence, a feasible mechanism for the crucial 5&#8208;endo&#8208;tet&#8208;type cyclization is proposed.

The proposed mechanism of the key reaction is supported by the experimental results. Based on these experimental results, the 5&#8208;endo&#8208;tet&#8208;type cyclization of a cyclopropylcarbinol proceeds predominantly via an SN1 mechanism with high trans&#8208;selectivity, which arises from the steric hindrance of the neighboring substituent. Minor pathways include the anchimeric participation of (i)&#8197;the oxygen atom of the benzoyl group in an SN2 mechanism and/or (ii)&#8197;a benzene&#8208;coordinated transition state in an SN1&#8208;like mechanism.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Aryl Lactams by Heck&#8208;Matsuda and Heck&#8208;Mizoroki Arylations of Enelactams</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effective enantioselective arylation of enelactams using chiral N,N&#8208;ligands was accomplished by using arenediazonium salts or aryl iodides. The use of these distinct electrophiles allowed for the synthesis of several enantioenriched &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aryl lactams in moderate to good yields in enantiomeric ratios of up to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5. A rationale for the enantioselective process was constructed by an extensive investigation using DFT calculations.







Abstract
The chiral aryl lactam nucleus is a common motif present in many bioactive natural products and the development of effective enantioselective methodologies for its preparation is of great interest. In this work, we report the synthesis of several enantioenriched aryl lactams in good yields and enantiomeric ratios using a combined strategy employing arenediazonium salts bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents, aryl iodides with electron&#8208;donating substituents, and chiral N,N&#8208;ligands. The chiral &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aryl lactams were obtained in yields of up to 78&#8201;% and enantiomeric ratios up to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the use of chiral N,N&#8208;ligands as a viable alternative to the phosphine&#8208;based ligands in the enantioselective Heck&#8208;Mizoroki reactions using aryl iodides. The origins of the enantioselectivity and the full catalytic cycle for the Heck&#8208;Matsuda arylation of the enelactams were investigated through DFT calculations.

         <title>New Insights into the Exploitation of BODIPY Derivatives as Organic Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed structure&#8208;activity relationship study onto six different BODIPY photocatalysts was performed towards a synthetically relevant atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reaction. The presence of heavy atoms in the chromophore's core was revealed to be essential for high reactivity levels. On the contrary, electron&#8208;withdrawing groups at the meso position deteriorated the catalytic performances, consistently with the proposed reaction mechanism.







Abstract
Boron&#8208;dipyrromethene complexes (BODIPYs) are attracting a growing interest for their notable photophysical properties. Specifically, their application in organic photocatalysis is receiving particular attention thanks to their ability to undergo both electron and energy transfer processes, thus acting as promising photoredox catalysts and photosensitizers. Although the number of examples employing these organic dyes is constantly increasing, there are not so many studies that correlate their chemical composition to their photocatalytic activity. In this work, a rationally designed structure&#8208;activity relationship study was performed by selecting a synthetically relevant atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reaction as a benchmark. We demonstrated how the presence of heavy atoms in the chromophore's core turned out to be essential for achieving high reactivity levels. On the contrary, electron&#8208;withdrawing groups in position 8 (meso) undermined the catalytic performances, in agreement with the proposed reaction mechanism.

         <title>Stereocontrolling Effect of a Single Triisopropylsilyl Group in 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;Glucosylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycosylation with thioglucosides with a single triisopropylsilyl (TIPS) group at O&#8208;2 is highly 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;stereoselective when weak nucleophiles (ROH) are used. Glycosylation proceeds along the SN1&#8208;like pathway via glycosyl cation, which is locked in 4H3 conformation with bulky TIPS group in the pseudo&#8208;equatorial position.







Abstract
Glycosylation with phenyl 3,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;O&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;2&#8208;O&#8208;triisopropylsilyl (TIPS)&#8208;1&#8208;thio&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucopyranoside is highly 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;stereoselective, while the use of 2,3&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;TIPS glucosyl donor with benzoyl groups at O&#8208;4 and O&#8208;6 results in the loss of &#945;&#8208;stereoselectivity (&#945;/&#946;=3&#8201;:&#8201;1). Complete &#945;&#8208;stereocontrol with 2&#8208;O&#8208;TIPS substituted glucosyl donors could only be achieved in glucosylation of weak nucleophiles. In this case, the glucosylation seems to proceed along the SN1&#8208;like pathway via the 4H3 conformer of glycosyl cation stabilized by the bulky TIPS group at O&#8208;2.

         <title>A Green Multicomponent Domino Mannich&#8208;Michael Reaction to Synthesize Novel Naphthoquinone&#8208;Polyphenols with Antiproliferative and Antioxidant Activities</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes a new methodology to synthesize novel naphthoquinone polyphenols. These compounds were submitted to CRAC assays, and, in general, showed antioxidant activities superior to Trolox. In addition, the antiproliferative activity of the most active compounds showed IC50 values for HCT116 and PC3 comparable to those of 5&#8208;fluorouracil and superior to doxorubicin in HL60 and SNB19 human cancer cells.







Abstract
This study reports on the one&#8208;step, green, catalyst&#8208;free synthesis of new naphthoquinone&#8208;polyphenols through an innovative method using the multicomponent domino Mannich&#8211;Michael reaction in the lawsone. After optimized condition reactions, twelve novel naphthoquinone polyphenols were synthesized with good yields. The polyphenols were tested on four cancer cell lines (HCT116, PC3, HL60, and SNB19), in which the best results showed antiproliferative activity with IC50 of 25.83&#8211;47.95&#8197;&#956;M. Additionally, we used the CRAC assay to quantify the antioxidant capacity of each compound and determined a hierarchy based on the Trolox equivalent values.

H&#8208;bonded counterion&#8208;directed catalysis has been applied to the enantioselective tandem cycloisomerization&#8208;addition to 2&#8208;alkynyl enones. The addition of C&#8208;, N&#8208; or O&#8208;centered nucleophiles catalyzed by a phosphinosquaramide Au(I) chloride/chiral Ag(I) phosphoramidate system afforded bicyclic furans in moderate to excellent yield and enantioselectivity (28 examples, 59&#8211;96&#8201;% yield, 62&#8201;:&#8201;38 to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 er).







Abstract
H&#8208;bonded counterion&#8208;directed catalysis (HCDC) is a strategy wherein a chiral anion that is hydrogen&#8208;bonded to the achiral ligand of a metal complex is responsible for enantioinduction. In this article we present the application of H&#8208;bonded counterion&#8208;directed catalysis to the Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective tandem cycloisomerization&#8208;addition reaction of 2&#8208;alkynyl enones. Following the addition of C&#8208;, N&#8208; or O&#8208;centered nucleophiles, bicyclic furans were obtained in moderate to excellent yield and enantioselectivity (28 examples, 59&#8211;96&#8201;% yield, 62&#8201;:&#8201;38 to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 er). The optimal catalytic system, comprising a phosphinosquaramide Au(I) chloride complex and a BINOL&#8208;derived phosphoramidate Ag(I) salt, was selected in a combinatorial fashion from a larger library with the help of high&#8208;throughput screening. An enantioselectivity switch of ca. 120 &#916;ee% was observed upon addition of the achiral Au(I) component to the Ag(I) salt.

The addition of C-, N- or O-centered nucleophiles catalyzed by a phosphinosquaramide Au(I) chloride/chiral Ag(I) phosphoramidate system afforded bicyclic furans in moderate to excellent yield and enantioselectivity (28 examples, 59&#8211;96&#8201;% yield, 62&#8201;:&#8201;38 to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 er).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H-bonded counterion-directed catalysis (HCDC) is a strategy wherein a chiral anion that is hydrogen-bonded to the achiral ligand of a metal complex is responsible for enantioinduction. In this article we present the application of H-bonded counterion-directed catalysis to the Au(I)-catalyzed enantioselective tandem cycloisomerization-addition reaction of 2-alkynyl enones. Following the addition of C-, N- or O-centered nucleophiles, bicyclic furans were obtained in moderate to excellent yield and enantioselectivity (28 examples, 59&#8211;96&#8201;% yield, 62&#8201;:&#8201;38 to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 er). The optimal catalytic system, comprising a phosphinosquaramide Au(I) chloride complex and a BINOL-derived phosphoramidate Ag(I) salt, was selected in a combinatorial fashion from a larger library with the help of high-throughput screening. An enantioselectivity switch of ca. 120 &#916;ee% was observed upon addition of the achiral Au(I) component to the Ag(I) salt.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organocatalytic One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Pseudo&#8208;Terpenoids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;pot synthesis of terpenoids: An organocatalytic coupling and annulation methodology was developed for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of structurally complex cedrane scaffolds in very good yields with high chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. It represents a highly economical, novel, and green method for the cedrane scaffolds synthesis.







Abstract
Structurally complex cedrane scaffolds were synthesized in very good yields with high chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivities in a sequential one&#8208;pot manner. A combination of intermolecular olefination, intramolecular Michael and Michael reactions or intermolecular olefination, intramolecular Michael and aldol reactions were used as the key steps from the readily available hydroxy&#8208;p&#8208;quinone butanals and phosphoranes with catalytic amounts of quinine at ambient temperatures for a few hours. This is a unique one&#8208;pot combination of coupling and annulation routes for the green synthesis of a library of tricyclic pseudo&#8208;terpenoids (cedrane scaffolds) with high selectivity and yields. Organocatalytic ring isomerization was highlighted through transforming one ring into another one by retro&#8208;cyclization. We have discussed thoroughly mechanistic aspects of these tandem coupling/annulation and ring isomerization reactions based on control experiments and X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis.

This review outlines a handful of transformations employing transition&#8208;metal and photoredox catalysis by auxiliary&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H activation strategy to assemble synthetic libraries of C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. The review also features the substrate scope and mechanistic insights of the key methodologies.







Abstract
Metallaphotoredox catalysis represents the combination of two activation modes: metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization and visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photocatalysis. This appealing dual catalysis technique has evolved as a versatile platform that has paved the way for diverse low&#8208;energy pathways for a plethora of synthetic transformations. The synergistic combination of two &#8220;green&#8221; approaches has garnered enormous interest owing to the development of sustainable strategies. In the recent past, significant advancements have been accomplished in constructing site&#8208;selective C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. This review outlines the use of photoredox catalysis in directing group&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H functionalization reactions. The mechanistic insights of the developments and synthetic applications are addressed.

         <title>A Steroidal Molecular Rotor with Fast Solid&#8208;State Dynamics Obtained by Crystal Engineering: Role of the Polarity of the Stator</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theoretical/experimental study is presented for a set of Steroidal Molecular Rotors (SMRs). Extensive DFT computations and SXRD experiments revealed a potential correlation between the polarity of the stator and the rotational activation energy. Following this crystal engineering criterium we report a rare example of a SMR with fast rotational dynamics in spite of featuring a crystallographically crowded rotator.







Abstract
A set of Steroidal Molecular Rotors (SMRs) were synthesized and characterized employing a Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction as the key synthetic step. The static dipole moment (&#956;0) of the stator was examined as a crystal engineering criterium that could determine the easiness with which the rotator participates in the high energy supramolecular interactions that frequently preclude rotation in this class of molecular machines. The strategy is critically evaluated through theoretical/experimental analyses, featuring SXRD experiments and QM/MM computations of the rotational activation energy (Ea), allowing us to propose, within the systems studied, a potential correlation between the use of stators with lower &#956;0 and a lowering of the Ea value. Results from solid&#8208;state NMR revealed that one of the most promising compounds indeed hosts fast rotational motion (above 25&#8211;30&#8197;kHz), standing as a rare example of a SMR with fast rotation within a crowded crystallographic environment.

         <dc:description>
Catalytic Csp2&#8722;H oxygenation is a challenging transformation in organic synthesis owing to its selectivity and efficiency. This Review highlights recent advances in the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;selective Csp2&#8722;H alkoxylation and acetoxylation of unactivated Csp2&#8211;H bonds using different types of directing groups.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed Csp2&#8722;H oxygenation is a synthetically invaluable transformation that enables the incorporation of synthetically useful functional groups, such as ethers and acetates, using a simple protocol. Compared to the well&#8208;developed palladium catalysis, the catalysis of cobalt, a 3d&#8208;transition metal, is recognized as a sustainable alternative for Csp2&#8722;H oxygenation because of the natural abundance of cobalt and cost&#8208;effectiveness of the catalyst. In this Review, recent advances in cobalt&#8208;catalyzed Csp2&#8722;H alkoxylation and acetoxylation are highlighted and several types of directing groups are discussed.

A biocatalytic and enantioselective methodology for the synthesis of dihydropyrimidinone/thiones was developed using lipase B from Candida antarctica. The results were promising even in cases in which the stereogenic centre was in remote positions from the reaction site (ee values up to 99&#8201;%). Molecular docking studies were performed to support the stereospecificity observed for the products formed.







Abstract
The Biginelli synthesis is a classic tricomponent reaction known to result in polyfunctionalized dihydropyrimidinone (DHPM) derivatives. Herein, we described a chemo&#8208;enzymatic strategy for obtaining enantiomerically enriched hydroxy&#8208;DHPMs. These compounds were previously esterified with butyric or acetic anhydride and were later submitted to hydrolysis reactions catalysed by lipase B from Candida antarctica. Although the stereogenic centre is far from the reaction site (4&#8211;5&#8197;bonds), moderate to excellent enantiomeric excess values were obtained (up to 99&#8201;%). Docking studies were performed in parallel to elucidate the binding modes of some molecules with the CALB active site, and were able to provide information on the enantiospecificity of these compounds in the hydrolysis reaction.

&lt;p&gt;The Biginelli synthesis is a classic tricomponent reaction known to result in polyfunctionalized dihydropyrimidinone (DHPM) derivatives. Herein, we described a chemo-enzymatic strategy for obtaining enantiomerically enriched hydroxy-DHPMs. These compounds were previously esterified with butyric or acetic anhydride and were later submitted to hydrolysis reactions catalysed by lipase B from &lt;i&gt;Candida antarctica&lt;/i&gt;. Although the stereogenic centre is far from the reaction site (4&#8211;5&#8197;bonds), moderate to excellent enantiomeric excess values were obtained (up to 99&#8201;%).
