      <title>Facile Construction of Benzofulvene Scaffold from Tetraaryl[3]cumulene via Electrophilic Iodocyclization</title>
      <dc:description>We found that the reaction of tetraaryl[3]cumulenes with N&#8208;iodosuccinimide afforded the corresponding iodinated triarylbenzofulvenes with high yields under mild reaction conditions. Unsymmetrical tetraaryl[3]cumulenes underwent regioselective reactions to give a single isomer of benzofulvenes depending on the aryl substituents. The obtained iodinated benzofulvene was successfully used as aryl iodide&#160;for common cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and the corresponding tetrasubstituted benzofulvenes was easily accessed via Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura and Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reactions, respectively.</dc:description>

      <title>Hydroarylation of Allenyl Derivatives Catalyzed by Copper</title>
      <dc:description>A additive&#8208;free copper catalytic system was used to perform the addition of (hetero)aryl nucleophiles to&#160;  N  &#8208;allenyl derivatives. This intermolecular C&#8208;C bond formation occurs with both complete regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity to afford the linear (  E  ) allylic product with moderate to excellent yields.

      <title>Stereo&#8208; and Regioselective Construction of Spirooxindoles having Continuous Spiral Rings via Asymmetric [3+2] Cyclization of 3&#8208;Isothiocyanato Oxindoles with Thioaurone Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>A highly efficient enantioselective [3+2] cyclization of 3&#8208;isothiocyanato oxindoles with thioaurone derivatives was explored for the synthesis of spirooxindoles containing continuous spiral ring structures. Three continuous spiral ring structures and three consecutive chiral centers (including two spiro quaternary stereocenters) were conveniently constructed at a time. In addition, an uncommon sulfur&#8208;containing spirocyclic ring was constructed at the same time. The reaction went smoothly whether the alkenyl moiety of thioaurone derivatives was at 2&#8208;position (up to 99% yield, up to 99% ee, up to &gt; 20:1 dr) or at 3&#8208;position (up to 96% yield, up to 95% ee, up to 12:1 dr).</dc:description>

      <title>Intermediate Products of C60 High&#8208;Temperature Chlorination, C60Cln (n = 8, 10, 14, 20, 24)</title>
      <dc:description>The products of high&#8208;temperature (440 &#176;C) chlorination of C60 with SbCl5 differ considerably from the products obtained at room temperature because high&#8208;temperature allows for chlorine migration over the fullerene cage. Thus, one can expect to obtain the most favorable chlorination patterns for any C60Cln stoichiometry. We report the isolation and structural characterization of several chlorofullerenes, C2v&#8208;C60Cl8, C1&#8208;C60Cl10, and C1&#8208;C60Cl14, that are intermediates to the more kinetically stable higher chlorides. Theoretical DFT calculations of formation energies verified high thermodynamic stability of the isolated chlorides. Further chlorination produces Th&#8208;C60Cl24 and, eventually, non&#8208;IPR chlorides, 1805C60Cl24 and 1794C60Cl20. as a result of cage rearrangements. Also isolated is a product of the cage shrinkage, C58Cl20.</dc:description>

      <title>Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution (SNAr) and Related Reactions of Porphyrinoids: Mechanistic and Regiochemical Aspects</title>
      <dc:description>The nucleophilic substitution of aromatic moieties (S  N  Ar) has been known for over 150 years and found wide use for the functionalization of (hetero)aromatic systems. At current, several &#8216;types&#8217; of S  N  Ar reactions have been established and notably the area of porphyrinoid macrocycles has seen many uses thereof. Herein we detail the reaction of seven types of porphyrinoids with differing number and type of pyrrole units: subporphyrins, norcorroles, corroles, porphyrins, azuliporphyrins, N&#8208;confused porphyrins, and phthalocyanines. For each we analyze the substitution dependent upon: a) the type of nucleophile and b) the site of substitution (&#945;, &#946;, or meso). Along with this we evaluate this route as a synthetic strategy for the generation of unsymmetrical porphyrinoids. Distinct trends can be identified for each type of porphyrinoid discussed, regardless of nucleophile. The use of nucleophilic substitution on porphyrinoids is found to often be a cost&#8208;effective procedure with the ability to yield complex substituent patterns, which can be conducted in non&#8208;anhydrous solvents with easily accessible simple porphyrinoids.</dc:description>

      <title>Molecular Switches and Motors Powered by Orthogonal Stimuli</title>
      <dc:description>Synthetic molecular machines are designed to undergo specific nanoscale movements in response to specific physical or chemical stimuli. The &#8220;engines&#8221; of molecular machines responsible for their motion are usually presented by molecular switches and motors that undergo predetermined shape transformations upon appropriate stimulation. Various types of molecular switches and motors activated by different stimuli, such as light irradiation or chemical input, have been devised and used as the core of mechanically active molecular systems. However, despite extensive research, the structural and functional complexity of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthetic molecular machines does not rival that of biological or human&#8208;scale counterparts. The most apparent difference is that current molecular machines show only limited modes of translational, rotational, and oscillatory motion that are typically triggered by a single stimulus. A promising strategy for achieving more elaborate movement is to integrate multiple active parts that can be manipulated by orthogonal stimuli. However, this approach is often complicated by mutual interference between the components or between stimuli. In this review, we survey recent notable progress in the development of molecular switches and motors that exhibit distinct modes of movement triggered by orthogonal stimuli. Though this approach is challenging, it may provide insights about the innovation needed to develop next&#8208;generation molecular machines with improved maneuverability and more sophisticated functions.</dc:description>

      <title>Evolution of Strategies in Protecting&#8208;Group&#8208;Free Synthesis of Natural Products: A Recent Update</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of complex natural products must be realized with high economy and efficiency contributing largely to sustainable development in synthetic organic chemistry. The strategies should adopt protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free approaches contributing toward step&#8208;economy thereby enhancing efficiency and economy. Various approaches based on chiral pool, auxiliary&#8208;based methods, cascade, biomimetic, enzymatic and photocatalytic used in total synthesis of natural products and following the PGF&#8208;criteria over the last two years (2018&#8208;2019) have been reviewed here.

      <title>Thiourea&#8208;tertiary amine Promoted Cascade Catalysis: A Tool for Complexity Generation</title>
      <dc:description>The bifunctional organocatalyst promoted, relay&#8208;cascade catalysis (use of a single catalyst capable of promoting each catalytic cycle in the designed cascade process) has been the hot area of research in recent times, as it enables the green synthesis of complex molecular architectures in an atom, cost and step&#8208;economic fashion. In this context we summarized the recent developments (for last fifteen years) in the area of the thiourea&#8211;  tert  &#8208;amine based cascade catalysis in the current review article. The discussion was divided into three subsections,  viz  . double&#8208;, triple&#8208; and quadruple cascades depending on the number of individual steps involved in the cascade process. In each type there are various combinations of reactions like Michael addition, aldol reaction, Henry reaction, Knoevenagel reaction, cyclization, trans&#8208;esterifications etc. Divergent polycyclic structural frameworks have been achieved employing this cascade catalytic strategy as evidenced in this review. We assume that the current review article would be a handle for the design and development as well as further growth of this potential greener approach.</dc:description>

      <title>Hypervalent Iodine&#8208;Mediated Styrene Hetero&#8208; and Homodimerization Initiation Proceeds with Two&#8208;Electron Reductive Cleavage</title>
      <dc:description>A mechanistic insight into the hetero&#8208; and homodimerizations (HETD and HOMD) of styrenes promoted by hypervalent iodine reagents (HVIRs;  DMP  and  PIDA  ) and facilitated by hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) to yield all  trans  cyclobutanes is reported using density functional theory (DFT) calculations.  The initialization involving direct bimolecular one&#8208;electron transfer is found to be highly unfavored, especially for the  PIDA  system. At this point, we suggest that the reaction is initiated with an overall two&#8208;electron reductive cleavage of two I&#9472;O bond cleavages, affording I(III) (iodinane) and I(I) (iodobenzene) product with DMP and PIDA as oxidant, respectively. The resulting acetate groups are stabilized by the solvent HFIP through strong hydrogen bonding interaction, which promotes the electron transfer process. The nature of the electron transfer is studied in detail and found that the overall two&#8208;electron transfer occurs within tri&#8208;molecular complex organized by &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions and as a stepwise and concerted mechanism for I(III) and I(V) oxidants, respectively. The reaction rate is determined by the initialization step: for I(III), the initiation is thermodynamically endergonic, whereas the endergonicity for I(V) is modest. Upon initialization, the reaction proceeds through a stepwise [2+2] pathway, involving a radical&#8208;cationic &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacked transition states, where the HOMD is dynamically competing pathway to HETD although the latter is relatively faster.</dc:description>

      <title>The Ugi three&#8208;component reaction; a valuable tool in modern organic synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>The Ugi three component reaction (U&#8208;3CR) is a variation of the famous Ugi reaction, discovered almost 60 years ago. Today it is somehow neglected, compared to the classical variation, although the derived from the reaction &#945;&#8208;aminoamides have been utilized as inhibitors for various targets and even commercial drugs, offering improved pharmacokinetic properties. In this review, we are describing the scope and limitations of the reaction with a special focus on the developed catalytic protocols, the bioactive compounds and drugs which are based on the reaction and finally the post modifications that have been reported in order to access drug&#8208;like and privileged scaffolds. A special focus is given to the 3D solid state conformations of the U&#8208;3CR derivatives.</dc:description>

The Cover Feature shows a continuous photochemical process converting amino&#8208;enone substrates into a series of quinoline and tetrahydroquinoline products. The amino&#8208;enone substrates are thereby irradiated with a new high&#8208;power LED lamp in the flow reactor to render the quinoline scaffold in higher efficiency than by using alternative light sources. In a telescoped manner, the quinoline products are then subjected to a Pd&#8208;catalysed hydrogenation process in a reactor that generates hydrogen gas in situ from water. This provides a powerful and green process that delivers various bioactive species including the antimalarial natural product galipinine. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M.

      <title>Diazanorbornene: A Valuable Synthon towards Carbocycles and Heterocycles</title>
      <dc:description>Desymmetrization of meso compounds is well recognized as a powerful method for delivering biologically relevant molecular skeletons in a few synthetic steps. Heterobicyclic olefins are a class of meso compounds which exhibit exceptional reactivity due to its high ring strain originating from the unfavorable bond angles and eclipsing interactions. Extensive research was carried out towards the synthetic transformations of oxa&#8208;, aza&#8208; and diaza&#8208;norbornenes/ norbornadienes for the synthesis of a wide variety of carbocycles and heterocycles in a single step, most importantly in a stereo&#8208; and chemo&#8208;selective manner. This review summarizes the relevant aspects of diazanorbornene reactivity which will inspire the synthetic community for exploiting these highly strained bicyclic systems for the creation of extensive libraries of novel structurally and biologically interesting molecules. The review is divided into several sections based on the type of reactions that diazanorbornenes are subjected to.</dc:description>

      <title>Catalytic selective oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols using nonheme [Iron(III)(Pyridine&#8208;Containing Ligand)] complexes</title>
      <dc:description>The selective oxidation of different primary and secondary alcohols to carbonyl compounds by hydrogen peroxide was found to be catalysed in conversion ranging from good to excellent by an iron(III) complex of a pyridine&#8208;containing macrocyclic ligand (Pc&#8208;L), without the need of any additive. The choice of the counteranion (Cl, Br, OTf) appeared to be of fundamental importance and the best results in terms of selectivity (up to 99%) and conversion (up to 98%) were obtained using the well characterised [Fe(III)(Br)2(Pc&#8208;L)]Br complex,  4c  . Magnetic moments in solid state, also confirmed in solution (d6  &#8208;DMSO) by Evans NMR method, were calculated and point out to an iron metal centre in the high spin state of 5/2. The crystal structure shows that the iron(III) centre is coordinated by the four nitrogen atoms of the macrocycle and two bromide anions to form a distorted octahedral coordination environment. The catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol in acetonitrile was found occurring with better conversions and selectivities than in other solvents. The reaction proved to be quite general, tolerating aromatic and aliphatic alcohols, although very low yields were obtained for terminal aliphatic alcohols. Preliminary mechanistic studies are in agreement with a catalytic cycle promoted by a high&#8208;spin iron complex.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The Diels Alder (DA) cycloaddition is one of the best methods for biomaterials conjugation to generate tools for biomedical applications.

      <title>The Cyclization of Allenyl&#8208;Substituted Hydroxylamines to&#160;1,2&#8208;Oxazines: An Experimental and Computational Study</title>
      <dc:description>To gain a deeper understanding of the formation of the synthetically important 3,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazines, the 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization of allenyl&#8208;substituted hydroxylamines was experimentally investigated in detail employing a model compound. The solvent effect was moderate with respect to the rate, but crucial to suppress side&#8208;product formation. Surprisingly, acids or bases had no big influence on the cyclization rate. With O&#8208;deuterated allenyl hydroxylamine a high primary isotope effect was found, indicating that the proton transfer is crucial in the rate determining step. DFT calculations evidence that the allenyl&#8208;substituted hydroxylamine is converted into an energetically similar zwitterionic intermediate with an allyl cation subunit. It cyclizes to the 1,2&#8208;oxazine as the most stable species. Alternative pathways starting from the zwitterion were computationally investigated. Interestingly, it can also undergo a fragmentation to give a pentadiene derivative and a nitroso compound. The hetero Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of these components may also deliver the 1,2&#8208;oxazine. To evaluate an alternative mechanistic scenario, calculations of the protonated allenyl&#8208;substituted hydroxylamine were also performed.</dc:description>

  Spongidepsin is a macrolide isolated from Spongia sp.

The major differences in the syntheses rely on the methods used to synthesize the C1&#8211;C5, the C6&#8211;C11, or C6&#8211;13 fragments as their connectivities to access spongidepsin are similar.

      <title>Investigation of Straightforward, Photoinduced Alkylations of Electron&#8208;Rich Heterocompounds with Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkyl Bromides in the Sole Presence of 2,6&#8208;Lutidine</title>
      <dc:description>
  No need for a complex photosensitizer: We introduce a method for selective photoinduced alkylations of electron&#8208;rich heterocompounds with electron&#8208;deficient allyl bromides in the presence of 2,6&#8208;lutidine at 365 or 405 nm. Mechanistic investigations reveal that a colored intermediate formed from 2,6&#8208;lutidine and alkyl bromide is involved in the photoactivation. Our approach uses commercially available reagents and a straightforward protocol.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Alkylations of simple electron&#8208;rich heterocompounds deliver valuable target structures in bioorganic and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we present a straightforward and photosensitizer free approach for the photoinduced C&#8211;C coupling of electron&#8208;rich unsaturated heterocompounds with alkyl bromides using 405 nm and 365 nm irradiation. Comprehensive mechanistic studies indicate the involvement of 2,6&#8208;lutidine in the formation of a non&#8208;covalently bound intermediate to which the function of a photosensitizer is attributed. UV/Vis spectra reveal the formation of a bathochromic shifted band when the electron&#8208;deficient alkyl bromide is mixed with the structural motif of 2,6&#8208;substituted pyridine. Upon photochemical excitation of this band, we find the initiation of the C&#8211;C bond&#8208;forming reaction. Using this approach highly versatile alkylation products, e.g. &#945;&#8208;substituted ketones and 2&#8208;substituted furan, thiophene, and pyrrole derivatives, are obtained in high selectivity. Furthermore, this synthetic methodology can be applied to access substituted indoles, which cannot be obtained by other transformations.

      <title>A Decade of Muricatacin Synthesis and Beyond</title>
      <dc:description>
  Various syntheses of both the muricatacin enantiomers and analogues adopting different strategies in the last decade are described in this review. Additionaly, the strategic use of muricatacin as starting point in synthesis of reticulatacin, cis&#8208;solamins and giganin is covered.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  In this review, we have abstracted the various syntheses of both enantiomers of muricatacin (a member of a bigger class of acetogenins, ACGs), over the last decade (2010&#8211;2020). Developments in the synthesis of various epimers, homologues, oxa&#8208;analogues, &#948;&#8208;lactones, and the furofuranone analogues are also enfolded in this review. Most of the synthesis involve chiral pool and catalytic enantioselective approaches, while a few are hinged on the use of chiral auxiliary and resolution methods. Muricatacin with orthogonally differentiated two oxy&#8208;functions also serve as a start point in the synthesis of higher molecules of the acetogenin family, for example, cis&#8208;solamins, and these have also been covered herein.

      <title>Synthetic Approaches to Fluoroalkyltelluryl&#8208;Substituted Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>
  CF3O, CF3S, and CF3Se chemistries have been widely described in the last years. Tellurium is the following chalcogen but the CF3Te chemistry remains poorly described. This review presents the different strategies and methods currently available.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Fluorinated substituents confer specific properties to molecules. In the last years, the merging of chalcogenes with trifluoromethyl or fluoroalkyl moieties has known a growing interest. However, the last non&#8208;radioactive family member, namely tellurium, did not receive much attention. This review will present and discuss the state of the art chemistry of RFTe, to describe the available methods and highlight the future developments to consider.
