         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative C&#8722;H Cyanation of Quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones with TMSCN</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 15, Page 2193-2197, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioselective electrochemical C&#8722;H cyanation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones with a nucleophilic cyano source TMSCN was achieved using an undivided electrolytic cell. Transition metal&#8208; and organic hydroperoxides&#8208;free conditions were the remarkable features of this protocol.







Abstract
Both quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and nitriles are valuable organic compounds, and it is an interesting task to introduce cyano into quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones. Herein a regioselective C&#8722;H cyanation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones was developed with a nucleophilic cyano source TMSCN under electrochemical oxidative conditions. This process allowed the synthesis of C3 cyanated quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones in moderate to excellent yields in the absence of transition&#8208;metal catalysts and organic hydroperoxides.

         <title>Cover Feature: Structural Studies of Norditerpenoid Alkaloids: Conformation Analysis in Crystal and in Solution States (Eur. J. Org. Chem. 15/2021)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 15, Page 2132-2132, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows the simplified X&#8208;ray structures of four biologically important norditerpenoid alkaloids. On the left are the well&#8208;known poison, aconitine and the clinically used lappaconitine. These two are natural products isolated from Aconite plants (in the background). The right&#8208;hand flowers are Delphiniums, from which methyllycaconitine and lycoctonine are obtained. Methyllycaconitine, one of the most potent and selective nAChR antagonists, does not show any of the biological activity of aconitine. Lycoctonine has lost the biological activity by losing the key aromatic side&#8208;chain. More information can be found in the Full Paper by I.&#8197;S. Blagbrough et&#8197;al.

An oxoammonium&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;C(sp3) allylation of allyl&#8208; and benzyl ethers using allylsilanes as nucleophilic partners is disclosed. This new C&#8722;C bond forming C&#8722;H activation process allows to obtain the corresponding coupled products in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
A new C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization reaction consisting of the oxidative &#945;&#8208;allylation of allyl&#8208; and benzyl&#8208; methyl ethers has been developed. The C&#8722;C coupling could be carried out under mild conditions thanks to the use of cheap and green oxoammonium salts. The scope of the reaction was studied over 27 examples, considering the nature of the substituents on the two coupling partners.

         <title>A Synthetic Route to Benzothiazocines with Two or Three Carbon Stereocenters via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular N&#8208;Arylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 15, Page 2203-2211, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A step economic route toward benzothiazocines bearing two or three carbon stereogenic centers on the 8&#8208;membered ring was established via intramolecular Cu&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;arylation. The method was successful on one example in the asymmetric version, demonstrating the accessibility of enantioenriched benzothiazocines.







Abstract
A new structural family of benzothiazocines bearing two or three carbon stereogenic centers on the 8&#8208;membered ring was synthesized by intramolecular Cu&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;arylation. The chiral racemic 1,3&#8208;aminothioethers precursors have been prepared from easily available starting materials. An ionic organic base was used for the first time in an intramolecular C&#8722;N coupling, in medium&#8208;ring series, leading to higher yields than those obtained with an inorganic base, and a partial epimerization in some cases. The synthetic sequence was successfully performed on one example in asymmetric version, demonstrating the accessibility of enantioenriched benzothiazocines.

         <title>Catalytic N&#8208;Acylation of Cyclic Amines by Arylglyoxylic Acids via Radical&#8208;Radical Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 15, Page 2198-2202, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique copper&#8208;based catalyst system allows for the N&#8208;acylation of cyclic amines by arylglyoxylic acids via radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling strategy. As evidenced by EPR, UV&#8208;Vis, and mass spectrometric analysis, the amide linkage formation proceeds through a Cu(I)/Cu(II) catalytic cycle involving a twofold SET process.







Abstract
A methodical mechanistic investigation allowed for the catalytic N&#8208;acylation of secondary cyclic amine counterparts by arylglyoxylic acids through radical&#8208;radical coupling. The reaction proceeds via a twofold SET&#8208;promoted Cu(I)/Cu(II) catalytic cycle under mild conditions. An analogous reaction variant allows for the N&#8208;acylation in a one&#8208;pot fashion directly starting from a secondary cyclic amine even in the presence of a second amine or hydroxy group.

         <title>2&#8217;&#8208;Derivatisation of 3&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;Methyl Pyrimidine Nucleosides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study of nucleoside and nucleotide analogs has been the subject of extensive development during these last decades. In this field, additions or substitutions on the sugar residue had led to potent drugs in antiviral and anticancer chemotherapies. Herein, we reported the stereoselective synthesis of a new series of pyrimidine nucleosides bearing a double modification in the 2&#8217; and 3&#8217; positions of the sugar scaffold.







Abstract
The stereoselective synthesis of some 3&#8217;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;3&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;methyl pyrimidine nucleosides is reported. The studied modifications concern the inversion of the configuration in 2&#8217;&#8208;position as well as the introduction of fluoro and azido substituents. The corresponding arabinonucleoside and 2&#8217;&#8208;substituted ribonucleoside analogs of uracil and cytosine have been obtained and fully characterized. Attempts to introduce fluoro and azido substituents with inversion at C&#8208;2&#8217; are also presented.

         <title>Diastereodivergent Synthesis of the Quinolizidine&#8208;Indolizidine Alkaloids of the Leontidine/Camoensine Family</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Leontidine and camoensine, the main representatives of the small quinolizidine&#8208;indolizidine alkaloid subgroup, are characterized by an inner bispidine system to which a 2&#8208;pyridone and a pyrrolidine are fused on opposite sides. We efficiently synthesized both natural products from the commercially available and abundant alkaloid cytisine, which was converted into the key intermediate,  N&#8208;  Boc&#8208;11&#8208;oxocytisine, by iodine oxidation and protection. Grignard addition, Paal&#8208;Knorr type cyclization, and hydrogenation delivered  endo&#8208;  pyrrol&#173;idine fused leontidine, while the reversed reaction order,  viz.  reduction, Sakurai allylation, and ring closure, afforded  exo&#8208;  pyrrolidine annulated camoensine. Hydrogenation and deoxygenation of the pyridone moieties provided four further alkaloids, tetrahydroleontidine, camoensidine, 11&#8208;epileonti&#173;dane and leontidane. In addition, the artificial alkaloid isoleontidine, carrying an  endo&#8208;  fused pyrrolidine on the same side as the pyridone, was prepared from C&#8208;13 oxidized cytisine.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimized synthesis of Fmoc/Boc&#8208;protected PNA monomers and their assembly into PNA oligomers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Continuous advancement of application of peptide nucleic acid (PNA) oligomers encouraged exploration of rapid and efficient synthesis of PNA monomers and oligomers. Among the PNA monomers developed, only a few are commonly used in automated PNA synthesis. Here, we report short and efficient protocols suitable for large&#8208;scale synthesis of Fmoc/Boc&#8208;protected PNA monomers with advantageous solubility properties; these also facilitate purification due to the traceless nature of the Boc protecting group. Initially, several coupling reagents were screened for assembly of a pentamer containing all four nucleobases, and then the most promising reagents were tested in the synthesis of a decamer. The Fmoc/Boc&#8208;protected monomers proved compatible with both manual synthesis and assembly on an automated peptide synthesizer at room temperature or at 40&#176;C. As compared to the commonly used coupling agent &#160;(1&#8208;[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazolo[4,5&#8208;b]pyridinium 3&#8208;oxide hexafluorophosphate (HATU) both 2&#8208;(1H&#8208;benzotriazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) and [ethyl cyano(hydroxyimino)acetato&#8208;O  2  ]tri&#8208;1&#8208;pyrrolidinylphosphonium hexa&#8208;fluorophosphate (PyOxim) proved more favorable, with the latter being superior. A previously reported side reaction of guanine bases in the presence of benzotriazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208;oxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP) was not observed with the phosphonium salts.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Organocatalytic Synthesis of aza&#8208;Spirocyclic Compounds from Isothiocyanates and Isocyanides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formal [3+2] cycloaddition reactions of compounds bearing exocyclic unsaturated functional groups and isothiocyanate or isocyanide derivatives as formal 1,3&#8208;dipoles provide spirooxindoles and other aza&#8208;spirocyclic compounds. This review surveys the latest developments of these reactions under asymmetric organocatalysis.







Abstract
The spirocyclic motif is present in natural products, chiral ligands, and compounds of pharmacological interest. Isothiocyanates as well as isocyanides bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups in the &#945;&#8208;position can be deprotonated and react as formal dipoles on account of the presence of a nucleophilic carbanion and an electrophilic atom in the isothiocyanate or isocyanide functional groups. In the last years a number of procedures involving the formal [3+2] cycloaddition reaction of isothiocyanates or isocyanides with cyclic compounds bearing electrophilic exocyclic double bonds have been developed for the enantioselective synthesis of aza&#8208;spirocyclic compounds. Among them, organocatalysis has played a predominant role in the development of asymmetric versions for these reactions. The synthesis of spirooxindoles by using this methodology has received especial attention, although other spirocyclic scaffolds are available depending on the structure of the dipolarophiles and the formal isothiocyanate and isocyanide dipoles.

         <title>An overview of 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;halo&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles from cycloaddition reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,2,3&#8208;triazoles are important scaffolds in several fields, and there is still a demand to construct these compounds, most notably the disubstituted 4, 5 compounds. The latter are obtained in different ways, but the 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;halo triazoles are generally the key intermediates in their synthesis. These halogenated compounds are an extraordinary platform to lead to a very great chemical diversity around the 4 and 5 positions. However, their own pathways are generally put aside at the expense of the substituted triazoles. This review is focused on the main synthesis of 5&#8208; and 4&#8208;halo 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles from cycloaddition followed or not of halogenation reaction. Unlike the halogens (iodine, bromine and chlorine), the 5&#8208; and 4&#8208;fluoro 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles will be presented separately due to their relatively more difficult and still recently challenging synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>RGD Peptide&#8208;Drug Conjugates as Effective Dual Targeting Platforms: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, targeted therapies have raised increasing interest as effective strategies to improve therapeutic efficiency, reduce the impact of adverse side effects, and overcome drug resistance, particularly in the field of cancer chemotherapeutics. Many examples of RGD (Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp) peptide&#8208;drug conjugates (PDCs) have been proposed as targeted drug delivery systems. These molecular hybrids embody high affinity ligands targeting disease signatures (overexpressed integrin receptors or specific integrin&#8208;related pathways within diseased cells/tissues) connected to recognized therapeutic units by means of carefully designed linker&#8208;spacer combinations, to ultimately control stability, physico&#8208;chemical properties, timing and localization of drug release. This account has collected and critically surveyed relevant contributions from the period of 2015 to the present day, wishing to provide a window open on new synthesis strategies facing the challenging issues of site&#8208;selective drug delivery and dual drug targeting.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of 5&#8208;(Alkynyl)dibenzothiophenium Salts: Synthesis of Diynes, Vinyl Sulfones and Phenanthrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of 5&#8208;(alkynyl)dibenzothiophenium salts  1  is explored in the presence of different nucleophiles, dienes, and under photochemical conditions. Reaction with lithium acetylides affords diynes in moderate yields; while depending on the substitution pattern, the reaction with sulfinates delivers either the alkyne transfer products, alkynyl sulfones, or &#946;&#8208;(sulfonium) vinyl sulfones via addition to the C&#8208;C triple bond. Similar behavior is observed when tosylamines are used as nucleophiles. Salts of general formula  1  also react with dienes to render the corresponding Diels Alder cycloadducts. The vinyl sulfonium salts obtained via these routes further react with nucleophiles via a Michael addition, dibenzothiophene elimination sequence. Alternatively, they also engage in photoinduced radical cyclizations to produce substituted phenanthrenes. Attempts to use this specific addition/radical cyclization sequence for the construction of the 6  a  ,7&#8208;dehydroaporphine skeleton present in several families of alkaloids are also described.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of azasugar&#8208;sulfonamide conjugates and their evaluation as inhibitors of Carbonic Anhydrases: the azasugar approach to selectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbonic Anhydrases (CAs; EC 4.2.1.1) are zinc metalloenzymes which play a pivotal role both in physiological and pathological processes in humans (h). Therefore, modulation of the activity of hCAs represents an appealing target for drug development, which results highly challenging due to the large number of isozymes expressed and requires the discovery of selective inhibitors. By following the &#8220;sugar approach&#8221; and in light of our recent disclosure of two selective hCAs inhibitors based on nitrogen containing glycomimetic&#8208;sulfonamide conjugates, twelve new azasugar&#8208;benzenesulfonamides have been synthesized. These compounds were prepared by connecting several benzenesulfonamides to a triazole armed azasugar, varying the length of chain and type of linking moiety (ureido, amido or thioureido) to probe their influence on the inhibition profile. The  in vitro  biological assays highlighted that such structural changes have remarkable effects on the hCAs inhibition profile. Several new compounds behave as selective inhibitors, and four of them are particularly effective on the therapeutically relevant hCAs II and VII isoforms.</dc:description>

         <title>Absence of Non&#8208;Linear Effects Despite Evidence for Catalyst Aggregation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One might think that the absence of a non&#8208;linear effect (NLE) might necessarily mean that only monomeric complexes catalyze a studied enantioselective reaction. Herein, a counter&#8208;example using an ephedrine&#8208;derived ligand in asymmetric alkylzinc additions is shown. The system is catalyzed by both monomers and dimers, although no NLE is apparent.







Abstract
An in&#8208;depth study of the catalytic system, consisting of the enantioselective addition of ZnEt2 to benzaldehyde with (1R,2S)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;N&#8208;Methylephedrine (NME) as chiral ligand, suggests the presence of dimeric and trimeric aggregates, as deduced from product ee vs. catalyst loading and NMR investigations (1H, DOSY). Formation of catalyst aggregation was excluded in earlier studies as this system displays a linear product ee vs. ligand ee&#8208;correlation, which is usually taken as an indication for the absence of catalyst aggregation. A subsequent theoretical study, using the monomer&#8208;dimer competition model, which we have recently developed, highlights the possible parameter configurations leading to linear product ee vs. ligand ee plots &#8211; despite the presence of catalyst dimers. It shows that, while the Kagan and Noyori models allow linearity in very specific cases only, a multitude of scenarios may lead to linearity here, especially if heterochiral dimers are catalytically active.

         <title>A Diversity&#8208;Oriented Approach to Large Libraries of Artificial Macrocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diversity&#8208;oriented approach to macrocycle libraries based on the &#8220;build/couple/pair&#8221; strategy was used to generate a virtual chemical space of 1.8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;105 compounds, with a possibility to further expansion via the &#8220;post&#8208;pairing&#8221; modifications. The method relied on a 4&#8211;5&#8208;step reaction sequence including ring&#8208;closing metathesis as the key step, with 61&#8201;% overall synthetic efficiency under parallel chemistry conditions.







Abstract
Diversity&#8208;oriented approach to large artificial macrocycle libraries with a ring size of 13&#8212;18&#8197;atoms relying on the &#8220;build&#8208;couple&#8208;pair&#8221; strategy is disclosed. The &#8220;couple&#8221; phase included three one&#8208;pot steps including consequent amide coupling of N&#8208;Boc&#8208;monoprotected vicinal diamines with two alkenyl carboxylic acids, followed by ring&#8208;closing metathesis as the key &#8220;pair&#8221; step. The scope and limitations of the method were established for all three reagents. In particular, various acyclic, mono&#8208; and bicyclic aliphatic diamine derivatives with the N&#8722;C&#8722;C&#8722;N dihedral angle less than ca. 130&#176; appeared to be suitable substrates. The proposed approach was used to construct a virtual library of 1.8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;105 macrocycles derived from 12,283 different scaffolds. More than 40&#8201;% of members of this library contained a protected amino function and hence can be suitable for the post&#8208;pairing modification, thus giving rise to at least a billion&#8208;size chemical space based on the REAL&#8208;type synthetic methodology. Validation of the approach under parallel synthesis conditions on a 383&#8208;member subset showed a 61&#8201;% success rate over the whole 4&#8211;5&#8208;step reaction sequence. Finally, the synthetic approach also worked on a gram scale (up to 8.0&#8197;g).

         <title>Nitroenynes as Electrophiles in Organocatalysis and their Application in the Synthesis of Chiral Heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitroenynes are an interesting electrophile in asymmetric organocatalysis, due to the versatility of the functional groups present in its structure. This review covers the organocatalytic examples using this electrophile and its application for the synthesis of chiral heterocycles.







Abstract
Nitroenynes are a particular class of nitroalkenes, that have been recently used in organocatalysis. This review covers the recent examples in asymmetric catalysis using nitroenynes as electrophiles. The majority of the examples are enantioselective Michael additions, that have been categorized depending on the nucleophile, with representative examples providing insightful mechanistic details. Moreover, their applications to the synthesis of chiral heterocylces has also been discussed.

         <title>The effect of TCNE and TCNQ Acceptor Units on Triphenylamine&#8208;Naphthalenediimide Push&#8208;Pull Chromophore Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetrical and symmetrical push&#8208;pull chromophore&#8208;based on triphenylamine (TPA) donors and naphthalenediimide (NDI) acceptors are designed and successfully synthesized via [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;retroelectrocyclization (CA&#8208;RE) reaction with well&#8208;known electron accepting tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) and 7,7,8,8,&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) groups. The novel series of compounds NDI&#8208;TPA&#8208;1 to NDI&#8208;TPA&#8208;6 were characterized to identify the influence of the TCNE and TCNQ &#960;&#8208;conjugated linkers on the optical, electrochemical and electronic properties of these molecules. We found that in dichloromethane the NDI&#8208;TPAs 1, 4, 5, and 6 display absorbance peaks at increasing wavelengths 605, 641, 646 and 645 nm, respectively. We demonstrated that through simple chemical modification we could drop the lowest occupied molecular orbital of NDI&#8208;TPA&#8208;1 to 6. Furthermore, NDI&#8208;TPA&#8208;1 to 6 were integrated into organic thin&#8208;film transistors (OTFTs) via spin&#8208;coating technique and charge transfer properties were investigated. We found that the choice of functional group led to either p&#8208;type, n&#8208;type or ambipolar characteristics.</dc:description>

         <title>Formal Aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions of Spiroindolenines with Electronrich Dienes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spiroindolenines were employed as cyclic imine substrates in formal aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions with Danishefsky&#8217;s diene or silyloxy&#8208;substituted electron&#8208;rich dienes for the synthesis of the corresponding tetrahydropyrido[1,2&#8208;  a  ]spiroindolinones. The reactions occur under mild conditions in the presence of ytterbium triflate as Lewis acidic catalyst delivering the desired compounds in good yield. The reaction results in the preparation of a small library of a new class of conformational constrained heterocyclic derivatives that easily undergo selective and efficient manipulations.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Preparation of Palladium Nanoparticles for C&#8208;2 Selective Arylation of Indoles in Agro&#8208;Waste Extract Based Mixed Solvents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and practical method for the  in situ  generation of palladium nanoparticles was successfully established in a water extract of pomelo peel ash. The produced palladium nanoparticles were characterized by energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy elemental mapping, field emission scanning electron microscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscope, X&#8208;ray power diffraction and showed high catalytic activity for selective C&#8208;2 arylation of indoles. A series of 2&#8208;arylindoles were smoothly installed in moderate to good yields through the direct palladium catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions of indoles and iodoarenes without external ligand, base, oxidant, and preinstallation directing group.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(I) Complexes of P&#8208;Stereogenic Josiphos and Related Ligands</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Starting from (  R  )&#8208;Ugi&#8217;s amine, diastereoselective lithiation followed by Ar&#8217;PCl  2  and then Ar&#8217;&#8217;MgBr led to the generation, as single diastereoisomers, of (  R  ,  S  p  ,  S  phos  ) [Ar&#8217; = Ph, Ar&#8217;&#8217; =  o  &#8208;Tol] and (  R  ,  S  p  ,  R  phos  ) [Ar&#8217; =  o  &#8208;Tol, Ar&#8217;&#8217; = Ph] PPFA ligand derivatives. Amine substitution of both with HPCy  2  gave  P  &#8208;stereogenic Josiphos ligands, and then addition of CuCl, the corresponding copper(I) complexes. The latter were also generated by use of borane P and N protecting groups and  in situ  Cu(I) complexation, avoiding the isolation of air&#8208;sensitive phosphine intermediates. This protection methodology was also applied to the synthesis of Josiphos/CuCl complexes derived from PCl  3  . In addition, related bulky cobalt&#8208;sandwich complex based derivatives were also obtained. Preliminary investigation revealed isolated CuCl complexes as competent catalyst precursors for enantioselective conjugate addition reactions.</dc:description>

The mechanism involving a carboxyl group&#8208;assisted the reactivity of alkynes, which makes the procedure of Michael addition proceeded smoothly, has been proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthetic strategies towards imidazopyridinones and 7&#8208;azaoxindoles and their evaluation as antibacterial agents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imidazopyridinones and 7&#8208;azaoxindoles are two classes of heterocyclic compounds with only limited previous use in organic and medicinal chemistry. Various synthetic methods and routes have been evaluated to identify safe and robust chemistry to advanced imidazopyridinone building blocks and inhibitor structures. Preparation of the 7&#8208;azaoxindoles was challenged by instability of the core scaffold. Key to the successful isolation of the target structure was development of a mild Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling in non&#8208;aqueous media. The imidazopyridinones were potent inhibitors of the  E. coli  thymidylate monophosphate kinase, while the&#160; 7&#8208;azaoxindole showed low activity. The compounds were inactive in cell&#8208;based studies, indicating poor cell wall penetration.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of the Core Structure of Palhinine A</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a strategy to the core structure of the alkaloid palhinine A passing through a 2,5&#8208;difunctionalized cyclohexenone. This enone was prepared by a domino Michael/aldol condensation sequence. An allylation reaction on the cyclohexenone followed by oxy&#8208;Cope rearrangement introduced an allyl group at C3. After generation of an aldehyde function on the terminus of the C5 substituent, an intramolecular aldol reaction led to a bicyclo[2.2.2]octanone. The five&#8208;membered ring of the core structure could be established by an intramolecular nitrile oxide&#8208;alkene [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition. Prior to this key transformation, the keto function was converted to an alkene and the allyl group to an oxime.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct asymmetric aldol reaction in continuous flow using gel&#8208;bound organocatalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Continuous flow catalysis using a microfluidic reactor with gel&#8208;bound proline organocatalysts is an attractive approach in organic synthesis due to interesting advantages such as the permanent production of catalyst&#8208;free product and the easy product isolation by evaporation. Further advantages are the online detection of reactions and an adjustment of reaction parameters while the reaction is already running. Herein the formation of differently substituted aldol products within minutes at mild conditions in good to almost quantitative yields is described. The effects of different solvent mixtures and temperatures on the conversion and selectivity are analyzed in detail by NMR as well as the relationship between the height of the polymer structures and the conversion behavior of the asymmetric aldol reaction of 4&#8208;nitrobenzaldehyde and cyclohexanone. The applicability of this system is demonstrated for a wide range of differently substituted nitrobenzaldehydes. It is shown that the described reactor setup delivers high conversion and good selectivity over up to 144 hours and that a highly reusable system was established.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide Head&#8208;to&#8208;Tail Cyclization: A &#8220;Molecular Claw&#8221; Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Both naturally occurring and artificial cyclic peptides are in high demand for a wide range of therapeutic applications due to the improvement of their enzymatic stability, cell permeability, and pharmacological activity compared to their linear counterparts. Among the simplest yet challenging cyclizations is the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail fashion, where linear peptides are cyclized via C&#8208; and N&#8208;termini, since most current peptide synthesis has been dominated by the use of C&#8208;terminal protecting supports. Herein, we demonstrate that a soluble&#8208;tag&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis in combination with a backbone amide linker strategy is applicable to the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclization. The use of an amide &#8220;N&#8208;tag&#8221; instead of the general terminal C&#8208;tag enables an effective head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclization on&#8208;support. The key for successful cyclization is a tagging position that enables the center of the peptide to be grabbed.</dc:description>

         <title>Lithium Hydroxide Assisted Endo&#8208;Selective [4+4]&#8208;Photocycloaddition of Pyran&#8208;2&#8208;ones</title>

         <dc:description>
Readily accessible 3&#8208;acyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxypyran&#8208;2&#8208;ones with pendent furans undergo [4+4]&#8208;photocycloaddition reactions in the presence of lithium ion to afford lactone&#8208;bridged cyclooctenones with complete selectivity for the endo cycloadducts.







Abstract
3&#8208;Acyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxypyan&#8208;2&#8208;ones with pendent furans, readily available from dehydroacetic acid, are substrates for intramolecular [4+4]&#8208;photocycloaddition. In the presence of stoichiometric lithium base, these substrates undergo conversion to lactone&#8208;bridged cyclooctenones in moderate to good yields upon irradiation in THF at 0&#8201;&#176;C. In contrast to other crossed [4+4]&#8208;photocycloadditions of pyran&#8208;2&#8208;ones, these examples proceed with complete diastereoselectivity for the endo cycloadducts.

         <title>A Kinetic Photometric Assay for the Quantification of the Open&#8208;Chain Content of Aldoses</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An operationally simple UV&#8208;based kinetic assay allows the accurate determination of the minute proportions (&lt;1&#8201;%) of the open&#8208;chain forms (OCC) of aldoses in equilibrium with the dominant ring forms. The OCC&#8208;data of all parent aldoses has been determined with this new ABAO&#8208;assay and is fully consistent with the literature gold standard, allowing extension into first practical synthetic challenges.







Abstract
Aldoses exist predominantly in the cyclic hemiacetal form, which is in equilibrium with the open&#8208;chain aldehyde form. The small aldehyde content hampers reactivity when chemistry addresses the carbonyl moiety. This low concentration of the available aldehyde is generally difficult to ascertain. Herein, we demonstrate a new kinetic determination of the (minute) open&#8208;chain content (OCC) of aldoses. This kinetic approach exploits the aldehyde&#8208;selectivity of 2&#8208;aminobenzamidoxime (ABAO), which furnishes a strongly UV&#8208;active adduct. Simple formation curves can be measured in a photometer or plate reader for high&#8208;throughput screening. Under pseudo&#8208;first order kinetics, these curves correlate with a prediction model yielding the relative OCC. The OCCs of all parent aldoses (pentoses and hexoses) were determined referencing against the two tetroses with exceptionally high OCCs and were in very good agreement with literature data. Additionally, the assay was extended towards higher&#8208;carbon sugars with unknown OCC and also applied to rationalise a lack of reactivity observed in a recent synthetic investigation.

         <title>Maleic Acid/Thiourea&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative ipso&#8208;Friedel&#8211;Crafts Reaction of Indoles to Produce Functionalized Spiroindolenines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergic effect of Br&#248;nsted acid and hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysis enabled a dearomative ipso&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts (DIFC) reaction of indoles with diazoamides. Pharmaceutically valuable spiroindolenines with various functionalities were chemoselectively synthesized under metal&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
A dearomative spirocyclization of diazo&#8208;functionalized indoles was developed under metal&#8208;free conditions. Although the spiroindolenine architecture with a tertiary alkyl substituent at the 2&#8208;position is a privileged scaffold of bioactive molecules, a general synthetic strategy has remained elusive. In this study, a dual catalyst system comprising maleic acid and Schreiner's thiourea was used to construct a spiroindolenine core that was inaccessible by rhodium or silver catalysis. Computational studies revealed a unique macrocyclic transition state consisting of the substrate, maleic acid, and thiourea cocatalyst, which lowered the activation energy of spirocyclization through multipoint mutual interactions.

         <title>Visualisation of chemical shielding tensors (VIST) to elucidate aromaticity and antiaromaticity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromaticity is a central concept in chemistry, pervading areas from biochemistry to materials science. Recently, chemists also started to exploit intricate phenomena such as the interplay of local and global (anti)aromaticity or aromaticity in non&#8208;planar systems and three dimensions. These phenomena pose new challenges in terms of our fundamental understanding and the practical visualisation of aromaticity. To overcome these challenges, a method for the visualisation of chemical shielding tensors (VIST) is developed here that allows for a 3D visualisation with quantitative information about the local variations and anisotropy of the chemical shielding. After exemplifying the method in different planar hydrocarbons, we study two non&#8208;planar macrocycles to show the unique benefits of the VIST method for molecules with competing pi&#8208;conjugated systems and conclude with a norcorrole dimer showing clear evidence of through&#8208;space aromaticity. We believe that the VIST method will be a highly valuable addition to the computational toolbox.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent advances in organic synthesis using light&#8208;mediated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of photocatalysis with other ground state catalytic systems have attracted much attention recently due to the enormous synthetic potential offered by a dual activation mode. Elseways, the use of  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) as organocatalyst emerged as an important synthetic tool. Its ability to harness umpolung reactivity via the formation of the Breslow intermediate has been employed in the synthesis of thousands of biologically important compounds. However, the available coupling partners are relatively restricted, and its combination with other catalytic systems might improve its synthetic versatility. Thus, merging photoredox and  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis has emerged recently as a powerful strategy to develop new transformations and give access to a whole new branch of synthetic possibilities. This review compiles the NHC catalyzed methods mediated by light, either in the presence or absence of an external photocatalyst, that have been described so far, and aims to give an accurate overview of the potential of this activation mode.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Approaches to the Enantiomers of Wieland&#8211;Miescher Ketone and its Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of different enzymatic activities and chemical protocols were exploited to access the two enantiomers of Wieland&#8208;Miescher ketone and three of its four alcohols derivatives as enantioenriched species. Specifically, the optimization of biotransformations of WM&#8208;ketone or of substrates (bio)chemically&#8208;prepared from it, mediated by hydroxysteroids dehydrogenases, short chain alcohol dehydrogenases and lipases, are described.







Abstract
Biocatalytic approaches have been investigated in order to isolate the enantiomers of Wieland&#8211;Miescher ketone (1) and of its alcoholic derivatives (cis&#8208;2 and trans&#8208;3). Specifically, two enzymes from our in&#8208;house metagenomic collection of oxidoreductases, IS2&#8208;SDR and Dm7&#945;&#8208;HSDH, catalyzed the kinetic resolution of the starting racemic ketone 1 or its complete conversion into two diastereomeric products, respectively. Moreover, the kinetic resolution of the racemic cis&#8208;alcohol (2) was very efficiently obtained (E&#8773;2.000) by lipase PS catalyzed acetylation in dry acetone. All the products were isolated with ee&#8805;95&#8201;%. Simple chemical elaborations of some of them allowed to isolate the missing enantiomers.

         <title>Selective Synthesis of 5&#8208;Alkylated and 5&#8208;Alkenylated Chromones via Catalytic C&#8208;H Coupling of Chromones with Allyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe two types of C5 functionalization reactions of chromones with allyl alcohols. Diverse 5&#8208;substituted chromones can be produced by modulating the catalysts in these reactions: Rh(III) results in the formation of 5&#8208;alkylated chromones, and Ru(II) furnishes 5&#8208;alkenylated products. We also achieve further functionalizations of these 5&#8208;substituted chromones, which demonstrates the superiority of this method. Notable features of these new methods include readily available precursors, tunable reactivity, exclusive C5&#8208;selectivity, and easy derivatization of products.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Studies of Norditerpenoid Alkaloids: Conformation Analysis in Crystal and in Solution States</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The A/E&#8208;[3.3.1]azabicyclic rings of norditerpenoid alkaloids adopt twisted&#8208;chair/twisted&#8208;chair conformations, causing the 1H NMR spectroscopic effect of steric compression of 2&#8208;Ha where the N&#8208;atom lone&#8208;pair electrons of these norditerpenoid alkaloids partly overlap with 2&#8208;Ha. This effect is shown to be more significant in synthetic [3.3.1]azabicycles where the analogues adopt true&#8208;chair/true&#8208;chair conformations.







Abstract
Conformational analyses are presented of several pharmacologically important norditerpenoid alkaloids (NDAs), in crystal and in solution states. Crystal data of 8 NDAs (4 free bases and 4 salts) were obtained, in which crassicauline A, aconitine HCl, and methyllycaconitine HClO4 are reported for the first time. 1D/2D NMR spectroscopies of 7 NDAs (5 free bases and 2&#8197;salts) were recorded comprehensively. Crystal conformations of NDAs are described with a revised cyclohexane ring nomenclature. The A/E&#8208;rings of NDA&#8208;free bases exist in twisted&#8208;chair/twisted&#8208;chair conformations, leading to examples of the 1H NMR effect of steric compression shown in the A&#8208;ring. The A/E&#8208;rings of NDA salts adopt boat/chair crystal conformations, as does the protonated synthetic [3.3.1]azabicycle in its crystal lattice. However, in aqueous solutions at physiological pH, this protonated analogue adopts a true chair/true chair conformation where the NDA salts retain their twisted boat/twisted chair conformations.

         <title>Fluorophore multimerization as an efficient approach towards bright protein labels</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell analysis techniques like flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy are widely used to explore cells in real&#8208;time and provide important insights into a variety of cellular processes. These techniques require bright and specific staining reagents to generate strong fluorescence signal and enable reliable read&#8208;out, making the choice of fluorescent labels a key aspect of experimental design. Much research has been done in the field of fluorophore development to generate bright small&#8208;molecule dyes, fluorescent proteins, and emitting nanoparticles. However, it remains challenging to modify biomolecules with multiple emitters and avoid self&#8208;quenching of such fluorophores at the same time. Herein, we present advances in multimerization&#8208;based methods for the generation of fluorescent labels with high brightness and discuss their advantages and limitations in the context of flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A series of axially linked pyrene&#8208;naphthalimide fluorophores (  N2Py  ,  N4Py  , and  BNPy  ) bearing a different number of 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide units substituted on pyrene and bis&#8208;pyrene cores were designed and synthesized using palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions in a stepwise synthetic manner. These molecules were chemically characterized, and their photoelectric properties were explored by spectroscopy, electrochemical and theoretical studies. They exhibited push&#8208;pull characteristics with intense fluorescence in solutions, strong solvatochromic behaviors, good thermal and electrochemical stabilities.  N2Py  ,  N4Py  , and  BNPy  were successfully applied as emitters in solution&#8208;processed OLED devices, which resulted in blue&#8208;green emissions with promising device performance. Particularly, the  BNPy  &#8208;based device achieved the best EL results with a maximum brightness of 3389 cd m  &#8208;2  , a maximum EQE of 3.98%, a maximum LE of 3.22 cd A  &#8208;1  , and a low turn&#8208;on voltage of 3.2 V.</dc:description>

         <title>PHANE&#8208;TetraPHOS, The first D2 Symmetric Chiral Tetraphosphane.&#160;Synthesis, Metal Complexation and Application in Homogeneous Stereoselective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PHANE&#8208;TetraPHOS, a new  D  2  symmetric tetraphosphane based on the [2.2]&#8208;paracyclophane scaffold, has been synthesized and characterized. The peculiarity of this system is the presence of four homotopic diphenylphosphane groups, exchangeable through  C  2  symmetry operations and consequently indistinguishable. Their spatial arrangement allows the simultaneous complexation of two metal atoms. Enantiomeric purity was attained at tetra&#8208;phosphane oxide level by fractional crystallization of the diastereomeric adducts obtained from the racemate with enantiopure dibenzoyltartaric acids. Alkaline treatment of diastereomerically pure adducts followed by exhaustive P&#8208;O groups reduction with HSiCl  3  gave both PHANE&#8208;TetraPHOS antipodes in an enantiopure state. They were tested as rhodium ligands in the homogeneous enantioselective hydrogenation of some benchmark unsaturated compounds. Catalytic activity and enantiodiscrimination ability were found comparable to those exhibited by the complexes of the parent bidentate ligand PHANEPHOS, but only half a mole of precious chiral ligand was employed.</dc:description>

         <title>The pseudotransannular ring opening of 1&#8208;aminocyclohept&#8208;4&#8208;ene&#8208;derived epoxides in the synthesis of tropane alkaloids. Total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Ferrugine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have optimized a synthetic approach to (&#177;)&#8208;Ferrugine in 8 steps starting from 5&#8208;aminocyclohept&#8208;1&#8208;ene and using the Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed pseudotransannular ring opening of the epoxide derived from this cycloheptene as the key step for the construction of the 8&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane central core. While attempting the enantioselective synthesis of this natural product from enantiopure 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;8&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane we have found that this compound shows a pronounced tendency to racemize  via  an achiral symmetric aziridinium intermediate. This racemization side process has been studied in detail using both experimental and computational methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and spectrophotometric studies of 9&#8208;substituted&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethoxyacridine multifunctionalizable fluorescent dyes and their macrocyclic derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acridine derivatives are widely used as antiseptics, disinfectants, antibiotics and fluorescent dyes as well as a subunit of optical sensor molecules of various analytical applications. We reported here the synthesis of several new 9&#8208;substituted&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethoxyacridine derivatives (9&#8208;bromo&#8208;, 9&#8208;(p&#8208;methylphenyl)&#8208;, 9&#8208;(p&#8208;benzyloxyphenyl)&#8208;, 9&#8208;azido&#8208;, 9&#8208;phenyltriazole&#8208;, 9&#8208;[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl]&#8208;, 9&#8208;nitrile&#8208;) as potential multifunctionalizable fluorescent precursors of sensor molecules, indicators or dyes including optimized procedures for preparation of 9&#8208;haloacridines and their cross&#8208;coupling reactions. An improved stability of several new compounds could be achieved by the synthetic modification at position  9  of the acridine unit compared to their unsubstituted acridine analogues. The basic spectroscopic characteristics of these useful intermediates were also determined. The new fluorescent compounds showed promising photochemical properties for optochemical&#8208;based applications in the future. The extremely large  Stokes&#8208;shifts (above 15500 cm  &#8208;1) should especially be emphasized. Moreover, the effects of the substituents at position  9  of the acridine unit on fluorescence signaling were studied by the examples of new precursors and their macrocyclic derivatives as known optical sensor molecules. Some interesting relationships between quantum yield and structural features were reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrosynthesis of stable betulin&#8208;derived nitrile oxides and their application in synthesis of cytostatic lupane&#8208;type triterpenoid&#8208;isoxazole conjugates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel lupane&#8208;type triterpenoid&#8208;isoxazole conjugates were designed by direct placing of isoxazole linker at C(17) of triterpenoid. The suggested synthetic sequence demonstrates successful combination of electro&#8208;organic synthesis and conventional approaches. TEMPO&#8208;mediated electrooxidation of betulin to betulinal was developed and optimized at boron&#8208;doped diamond anodes with potassium acetate as inexpensive supporting electrolyte. Betulinal&#8208;derived oxime was further selectively electro&#8208;oxidized at a graphite anode to nitrile oxide, which proved to be stable and isolable species. The same reaction sequence was performed with 3&#946;&#8208;lupane&#8208;3,28&#8208;diol. Nitrile oxides were characterized by 15 N NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The isolable nitrile oxides allowed creation of isoxazole library by 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions with various alkynes. Some of the title conjugates exhibit cytostatic properties against breast cancer cell line MCF7, glioblastoma multiform cell line U&#8208;87 MG and lung carcinoma cell line A549 with growth inhibition (GI 50 ) concentrations up to 11 &#956; m , while being harmless to immortalized human fibroblasts hTERT (GI 50 &gt; 100 &#181;m ).</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Free One&#8208;Pot Sonogashira&#8208;Type Coupling for the Efficient Preparation of Symmetric Diarylalkyne Ligands for Metal&#8208;Organic Cages**
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;free one&#8208;pot Sonogashira&#8208;type synthesis is reported that enables the synthesis of bipyridine&#8208; and benzimidazole&#8208;based ligands for metal&#8208;organic cages in high isolated yields and short reaction times.







Abstract
The often time&#8208;consuming and challenging multi&#8208;step synthesis of ligands for metal&#8208;organic cages is a limiting factor for the discovery and application of new cages. We report a highly efficient copper&#8208;free one&#8208;pot Sonogashira&#8208;type coupling for the preparation of symmetric diarylalkyne ligands on both a small and large scale; bipyridine&#8208; and benzimidazole&#8208;based ligands for the self&#8208;assembly of Co4L6 cages were synthesized in short reaction times and high isolated yields directly from aryl halide precursors. This one&#8208;pot method reduces the synthetic burden of ligand synthesis and will facilitate the preparation of ligands with additional functionality for applications of their corresponding cages.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extended &#960; systems based on 1,1&#8217;&#8208;aryl or (2&#8208;arylethynyl) disubstitution at ferrocene with thioate or dithioate end groups are reported. In the context of molecular electronics such end groups are possible alternative end groups for the attachment of molecular wires at gold surfaces. The respective thioates were successfully prepared in high yields via the respective carboxylic acid derivatives. Subsequent treatment with Lawesson&#8217;s reagent led to the respective dithioates. However, this did not work in the presence of triple bonds, in these cases product mixtures were formed. On the basis of literature evidence with Woollin&#8217;s reagent, the selenium analogue of Lawesson&#8217;s reagent, one product was tentatively characterized as a double cyclization product of two triple bonds and two molecules of Lawesson&#8217;s reagent. Preliminary experiments towards the formation of gold complexes by reaction with a Johnphos gold (I) salt are included.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploiting the Versatility of Palladium Catalysis: A Modern Toolbox for Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization received much attention in organic synthesis due to its efficiency and rapid transformation of simple starting materials into complex molecular skeletons. Celebrating the 10th year of the prestigious Nobel prize for palladium chemistry, we witness it still proceeds strong over other transition metals for its versatility. Cascade reactions in contemporary organic synthesis reduced cost and time through careful design. It has emerged as the first choice, a powerful tool for multiple bond formations in one step with a wide range of functional group tolerance due to the deep understanding of various pathways. A variety of compounds with biological relevance with complex molecular scaffolds have been achieved using these cascade coupling reactions. This review outlines Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions from the post&#8208;Nobel era. Nevertheless, more discoveries and endless possibilities for new transformations are underway.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Access to Pentacene&#8208;Silylene Adducts via Dehydrogenative Silylation of a 5,14&#8208;Dihydropentacene with a Stable Silylene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utility of a thermally stable divalent silicon species (silylene) toward the dehydroaromatization of a dihydropentacene is demonstrated. The reaction of a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)silylene with 6,13&#8208;dipropyl&#8208;5,14&#8208;dihydropentacene afforded the corresponding pentacene&#8208;silylene adducts. The reaction likely proceeds via a combination of 1,4&#8208;dehydrogenation and (1+4) cycloaddition of the silylene towards the dihydropentacene.</dc:description>

Aromatic compounds showed larger red shifts as compared to the aliphatic substituted analogs. The highest red shifts were observed with compounds featuring electron donating substituents.

         <title>Donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor thienopyrazine&#8208;based dyes as NIR emitting AIEgens</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic Near&#8208;Infrared luminophores have found broad application as functional materials, but the development of efficient NIR emitters is still a challenging goal. Here we report on a new class of thieno[3,4&#8208;  b  ]pyrazine&#8208;based NIR emitting materials with Aggregation Induced Emission (AIE) properties. The dyes feature a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) structure, with a thienopyrazine acceptor core connected to two triarylamine donor groups bearing a tetraphenylethylene (TPE) moiety. Fast and efficient synthesis allowed the modular preparation of three dyes of tunable absorption and emission profiles. These constructs were extensively characterized by spectroscopic studies in different solvents, which revealed intense light&#8208;harvesting ability and emissions in the deep&#8208;red and NIR region with large Stokes shift values. Remarkably, the dyes exhibited AIE properties, retaining emissive ability in the aggregate state, thus emerging as attractive materials for their potential application in the development of luminescent devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Para&#8208;functionalization of N&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;amino[2.2]paracyclophanes by regioselective formylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a simple and convenient procedure to prepare para&#8208;disubstituted [2.2]paracyclophanes in a straightforward manner. Our approach relies on a regioselective formylation of N&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;amino[2.2]paracyclophanes, which allows an easy access to a series of products incorporating a reactive aldehyde function para to the electron&#8208;donating group. These compounds can be engaged in a variety of orthogonal late&#8208;stage derivatization processes involving either the carbonyl group or the amine function, and can serve as precursors to rapidly access more complex paracyclophane derivatives. Control of planar chirality is also possible by performing a kinetic resolution of key racemic intermediates through asymmetric transfer hydrogenation. The formylation can be run on a synthetically useful scale, thus confirming the practical applicability of our method.</dc:description>

         <title>Noncovalent Interactions between Stacked Arenes in 1,8&#8208;Bis&#8208;(1&#8208;naphthyl)&#8208;naphthalenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A number of 1,8&#8208;bis(1&#8208;naphthyl)&#8208;naphthalenes have been prepared with a combination of electron&#8208;rich and electron poor in the two 1&#8208;naphthyl rings. The conformational analysis by NMR and ECD spectroscopy, aided by DFT calculations, showed that the atropisomers ratio and the conformational preferences within each atropisomer are mainly due to the Coulombic interactions between the two facing rings.







Abstract
A number of 1,8&#8208;bis(1&#8208;naphthyl)&#8208;naphthalenes, bearing different substituents in the 1&#8208;naphthyl moieties have been prepared to investigate the noncovalent interactions between the stacked arenes. The best geometries were determined by means of DFT calculations, and experimentally checked by NMR and electronic circular dichroism (ECD). High temperature NMR spectroscopy allowed for the determination of the balance between dispersive and electrostatic contributions (ratio between two diastereomeric syn/anti isomers of compounds 1&#8211;6), while ECD analysis of the syn isomers of compounds 3&#8211;5 allowed for a deeper insight on the electrostatic contributions that drive the geometry between the interacting rings. The two rings preferentially adopt a parallel displaced geometry, whose interaction energy is strongly influenced by the electrostatic features of the two naphthyl rings, and that dispersive forces play a very minor role.

         <title>Ditopic hexadentate ligands with a central dihydrobenzo&#8208;diimidazole unit forming a [2x2] Zn4 grid complex</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A family of ditopic hexadentate ligands based on the parent compound 2,6&#8208;bis(6&#8208;(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,5&#8208;dihydrobenzo[1,2&#8208;d:4,5&#8208;d']diimidazole (  L  ) was developed and synthesized by using a straightforward condensation reaction, which forms the interlinking central benzo[1,2&#8208;d:4,5&#8208;d']diimidazole bridge in the ligand backbone. The two secondary amine groups of the benzodiimidazole unit tautomerize and allow the formation of two tauto&#8208;conformers, which upon treatment with metal salts forms different isomeric coordination complexes. Here we report six new derivatives (  1  &#8208;  6  ) that can tautomerize (varying the pyrazolylpyridine part) and 14 derivatives (  7  &#8208;  13  ) with different alkyl and benzyl substitution on secondary amino groups (of  L  ) that prevent the tautomerization. In this way, it is possible to study the properties of isomeric coordination complexes and their intrinsic cooperativity by the example of [2x2] grid complexes in the future. A [2x2] Zn  4  complex of the ligand  L  was synthesized and structurally characterized.</dc:description>

         <title>Stopped&#8208;Flow 19F NMR Spectroscopic Analysis of a Protodeboronation Proceeding at the Sub&#8208;Second Time&#8208;Scale</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In&#8208;situ NMR spectroscopic analysis of homogeneous reactions is an essential tool for mechanistic analysis in organic and organometallic chemistry. However, rapid non&#8208;equilibrium reactions that are initiated by mixing require specialist approaches. We report on a study of the factors that ensure quantitative results in a recently&#8208;developed technique for stopped&#8208;flow NMR spectroscopy. The influence of some of the key parameters on quantitation is studied by 19F NMR spectroscopic analysis of the kinetics and activation parameters for the base&#8208;catalyzed protodeboronation of highly&#8208;reactive polyfluorinated arylboronic acids, with half&#8208;lives as low as 0.1 seconds. The effects of spin relaxation, pre&#8208;magnetization, heat&#8208;transfer versus reaction enthalpy, and mixing&#8208;efficiency are analyzed in detail. We also compare and contrast choice of pulse angle, interscan delay, and use of pseudo real&#8208;time via interleaving, as means to achieve an optimal balance between temporal resolution and sensitivity.</dc:description>

COF&#8208;JLU25, a COF&#8208;based photocatalyst comprised solely of electron&#8208;donating units, 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene (PyTA) and 4&#8208;[4&#8208;(4&#8208;formylmethyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl] benzaldehyde (TpDA), demonstrated excellent photocatalytic activity with high efficiency, robust reusability, and low catalyst loading when used in catalyzing the oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organic reactions are environmentally friendly green chemical transformations among which photosynthetic oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids to phenols has attracted increasing research interest during the very recent years. Given the efficiency and reusability of heterogeneous catalysts, COF&#8208;JLU25, an electron&#8208;rich COF&#8208;based photocatalyst constructed by integrating electron&#8208;donating blocks 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene (PyTA) and 4&#8208;[4&#8208;(4&#8208;formylmethyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl] benzaldehyde (TpDA), was selected as a photocatalyst for the oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids. In our studies, COF&#8208;JLU25 demonstrated excellent photocatalytic activity with high efficiency, robust reusability, and low catalyst loading, showcasing an application potential of previously underexplored COF&#8208;based photocatalyst composed solely of electron&#8208;rich units.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis, Structure and Properties of a Novel Class of Axially Chiral N&#8208;Aryl Quinolinium Salt</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterobiaryls containing a quaternized nitrogen within a chiral N&#8722;C axis occur in Nature and have been the target of several total syntheses. Here we reveal a general methodology towards enantio&#8208;enriched N&#8208;arylquinolinium salts, obtained via a four&#8208;step route from commercially available precursors and with axial stereochemistry controlled through an enantioselective ring&#8208;closing Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig coupling reaction.







Abstract
Inspired by naturally occurring molecules containing atropisomeric N+&#8208;C axes, we have developed a novel synthetic approach to generate a library of axially chiral N&#8208;aryl quinolinium salts. Enantiopurities up to 93&#8201;% ee were obtained via a four&#8208;step route from commercially available precursors. Axial stereochemistry was controlled through an enantioselective ring&#8208;closing Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig coupling reaction. The structure and properties of the salts were examined by X&#8208;ray crystallography, DFT, UV&#8208;Vis, and fluorescence spectroscopy, revealing high rotational barriers and solvatochromic behaviour.

         <title>2&#8208;(8&#8208;Iodonaphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;Substituted Nitronyl Nitroxide: Suppressed Reactivity of Iodine Atom and Unusual Temperature Dynamics of the EPR Spectrum</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cross&#8208;coupling of 1,8&#8208;diiodonaphthalene with an organogold nitronyl nitroxide stops at the monoradical with iodine atom at the peri&#8208;position toward the paramagnetic moiety. This arrangement causes a strong distortion of the nitroxide geometry and unprecedented temperature dynamics of the EPR spectrum. The latter can be explained by assuming different characteristic temperatures for averaging the anisotropy of the HFC tensors for N and I atoms.







Abstract
While developing methods for obtaining high&#8208;spin graphene nanostructures, we carried out a model cross&#8208;coupling reaction between 1,8&#8208;diiodonaphthalene and an organogold derivative of a nitronyl nitroxide. It was found that only one iodine atom reacted, leading to the corresponding 8&#8208;iodonaphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208;substituted nitronyl nitroxide. The latter was successfully isolated as two polymorphic modifications, whose X&#8208;ray structural analysis revealed a strong distortion of the paramagnet's geometry in comparison with a noniodinated analog. Moreover, the spatial proximity of the heavy iodine atom and the paramagnetic moiety resulted in unprecedented temperature dynamics of the EPR spectrum. To clarify these dynamics, quantum chemical calculations were performed using the exact two&#8208;component relativistic X2C method with the self&#8208;consistent account of spin&#8208;orbit coupling in conjunction with the B3LYP functional and relativistic STO&#8208;type basis set. These computations predicted a reasonable aiso(127I) value that can affect the EPR spectrum. Substitution of the second iodine atom would lead to the formation of a diradical with a 1,8&#8208;naphthalenediyl bridge, whose structure and magnetic properties were analyzed at the DFT level. Two stable conformations of the diradical with strongly distorted geometry were identified. In both conformations, calculations predict a ferromagnetic exchange between the paramagnetic centers with J=8 and 14&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (H=&#8722;2&#8197;J&#8901;S1S2).

         <title>Synthesis, cytotoxicity and leishmanicidal evaluation of ent&#8208;beyerene and ent&#8208;kaurene derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is an infectious disease endemic of tropical and subtropical countries. Current pharmacologic treatments have serious drawbacks. For these reasons, we need new and improved medical treatments. On the other side, natural products have been a valuable source of bioactive molecules, but unlike other products of natural origin, diterpenoids are molecules with only a few studies as antiparasitic drugs. Continuing our work on syntheses of beyerenes, and focusing on obtaining more compounds with antiparasitic activity, we describe in this work the syntheses and activity of several  ent  &#8208;beyerene and  ent  &#8208;kaurene type of compounds against CL, and also their toxicity. Utilizing classical reactions such as Grignard, Mitsunobu and Williamson, among others, it was possible to modify rings A and D of  ent  &#8208;beyerenes, specifically C&#8208;19 on ring A, and C&#8208;15 and C&#8208;16 on ring D. A total of 40 new compounds were obtained, 21 of them being active against  Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis  with median effective concentration (EC  50  ) values less than 25.0 mg/mL and of these with EC  50  values ranging from 1.8 to 7.1 mg/mL and Selectivity Index (SI) varying from 1.1 to 5.1. All compounds showed to be highly cytotoxic at concentrations less than 100 mg/mL, except compound  37  that was cytotoxic at 279.7 mg/mL and moderately active against  L. braziliensis  (EC  50  = 33.5 mg/mL and an SI of 8.4. All active compounds were  ent  &#8208;beyerene type.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective and additive&#8208;free hydrogenation of nitroarenes mediated by a DMSO&#8208;tagged molecular cobalt corrole catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the first cobalt corrole that effectively mediates the homogeneous hydrogenation of structurally diverse nitroarenes to afford the corresponding amines. The given catalyst is easily assembled prior to use from 4&#8208; tert &#8208;butylbenzaldehyde and pyrrole followed by metalation of the resulting corrole macrocycle with cobalt(II) acetate. The thus&#8208;prepared complex is self&#8208;contained in that the hydrogenation protocol is free from the requirement for adding any auxiliary reagent to elicit the catalytic activity of the applied metal complex. Moreover, a containment system is not required for the assembly of the hydrogenation reaction set&#8208;up as both the autoclave and the reaction vessels are readily charged under a regular laboratory atmosphere.</dc:description>

         <title>Planar and Rigid Pyrazine&#8208;Based TADF Emitter for Deep Blue Bright Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two blue donor&#8208;acceptor thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters containing pyrazine or dipyrazine as electron&#8208;acceptor are presented. The OLEDs based on these two emitters exhibited blue and sky&#8208;blue emission with CIE of (0.15,0.16) and (0.15, 0.30), respectively. The maximum external quantum efficiency for the blue device reached 11.6&#8201;% while for sky blue device it is 7.2&#8201;%.







Abstract
Two blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters bearing di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl carbazoles as the electron donor groups and pyrazine (DTCz&#8208;Pz) or dipyrazine (DTCz&#8208;Pz) as the electron acceptor are presented. The DFT calculations predict DTCz&#8208;Pz and DTCz&#8208;DPz to possess high S1 energies (3.19&#8197;eV and 3.08&#8197;eV, respectively), and relatively large &#916;EST values (0.52&#8197;eV and 0.56&#8197;eV, respectively). The closely layered intermediate triplet states between S1 and T1, predicted by DFT calculations, are expected to facilitate the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and improve spin&#8208;vibronic coupling efficiency between the excited states, even the relatively larger &#916;ESTs. The &#916;ESTs for DTCz&#8208;Pz and DTCz&#8208;DPz are 0.27&#8197;eV and 0.38&#8197;eV, and both molecules show high photoluminescence quantum yields (65&#8201;%, and 70&#8201;%, respectively). The decay lifetimes show temperature dependence in a PPT host, which is consistent with the fact that both molecules are TADF emitters in PPT. The OLEDs based on DTCz&#8208;Pz exhibit deep blue emission with &#955;EL of 460&#8197;nm and CIE of (0.15, 0.16). The maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) reaches 11.6&#8201;%, with a maximum luminance (Lmax) of up to 6892&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, while the device based on DTCz&#8208;DPz exhibits sky blue emission with &#955;EL of 484&#8197;nm and CIE of (0.15, 0.30), an EQEmax of 7.2&#8201;%, and Lmax of 8802&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Organocatalytic Amination of Pyrazolones with Azodicarboxylates: Scope and Limitations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric method for the amination of pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones using azo compounds is described. The developed process exhibits a wide substrate scope and high efficiency in terms of yield and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The organocatalytic amination of pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones with azodicarboxylates (catalyzed by quinine) is reported. This asymmetric process furnishes enantiomerically enriched hydrazine adducts containing quaternary stereocenters in high yields (74&#8211;96&#8201;%) and enantioselectivities (up to ee 97&#8201;%). Theoretical calculations allow us to propose the relations between quinine catalyst and reactants leading to observed stereochemical outcome and trends in the effectivity of the reaction.

         <dc:description>
2,3&#8208;Dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) is a classic oxidation reagent in organic synthesis. Upon visible light excitation its oxidation potential is boosted beyond+3&#8197;V vs SCE. This property has been used for oxidative organic transformations and catalyst regeneration is achieved by air oxygen or electrochemically.







Abstract
The one&#8208;electron oxidizing capacity of 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) improves significantly by visible&#8208;light excitation. The exited&#8208;state DDQ (DDQ*) even converts benzene, fluoroarenes, heteroarenes, benzyls, and olefins into their corresponding radical cations as well as chloride and other anions into their radicals. These reactive intermediates have been utilized for the generation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X (N, O, or Cl) bonds in the synthesis of valuable organic compounds and natural products. This mini review provides an overview of such DDQ*&#8208;initiated organic transformations with their scope and limitations and discusses the proposed reactions mechanisms.

&lt;p&gt;2,3&#8208;Dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) is a classic oxidation reagent in organic synthesis. Upon visible light excitation its oxidation potential is boosted beyond+3&#8197;V &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; SCE. This property has been used for oxidative organic transformations and catalyst regeneration is achieved by air oxygen or electrochemically.

         <title>Prevalent Bioimaging Scaffolds: Synthesis, Photophysical Properties and Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coumarin, xanthene, BODIPY, and cyanine are four of the most prevalent bioimaging scaffolds in chemical biology. In this review, we summarize the synthesis, structure&#8208;photophysical properties relationships, and imaging applications of fluorophores based on these units. We review the advantages and disadvantages of each scaffold in bioimaging as well as the practical issues to consider when using small organic compounds in biological systems.







Abstract
This minireview describes the syntheses, structure&#8208;photophysical properties relationship, and bioimaging applications of fluorescent coumarins, xanthenes, BODIPYs, and cyanines. Advantages and disadvantages of the emissive units are also discussed, as are general practical issues that need to be considered when using fluorophores in a biological setting.

         <title>Monoprotected Diamines Derived from 1,5&#8208;Disubstituted (Aza)spiro[2.3]hexane Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted (aza)spiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. Structural characterization of the obtained spirocyclic compounds provided a rationale for their applications in design of saturated ring isosteres and peptidomimetics.







Abstract
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted spiro[2.3]hexane and 5&#8208;azaspiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. In both cases, the method relied on the cyclopropanation of the corresponding cyclobutane or azetidine derivatives. In the case of monoprotected 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexanes, the title products were obtained as single diastereomers. X&#8208;Ray diffraction studies supported by exit vector plot (EVP) analysis showed that the obtained building blocks are promising piperidine/cycloalkane isosteres with potential utility to drug discovery. Also, conformations observed in the crystalline state for the two different diastereomers of 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexane derivatives prompt their application in design of &#946;&#8208;turn and sheet&#8208;like peptidomimetics, respectively.

         <title>Last of the gem&#8208;Difluorocycloalkanes 2: Synthesis of Fluorinated Cycloheptane Building Blocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isomeric gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane derivatives were obtained in two to six synthetic steps from readily available starting materials. The developed synthetic approaches were shown to be efficient for a multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of target compounds and involved six&#8208;membered ring homologation and/or deoxofluorination reactions as the key steps.







Abstract
The gem&#8208;difluorocycloalkane family was extended to all possible regioisomers of the gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane, monofunctionalized by carboxilic&#8208;, amino&#8208; or keto&#8208; group, that were synthesized on a multigram scale. The preparation of the corresponding building blocks was achieved from readily accessible starting materials either via six&#8208;membered ring homologation or deoxofluorination of the appropriate seven&#8208;membered cyclic ketones.

         <title>Reaction of N,N&#8208;Disubstituted Polyfluoroalkanethioamides with Diazomethane: Entry to New Thiirane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4&#8208;dioxane derivatives are discussed.






New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between N,N&#8208;disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

  Multigram synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates relying on efficient 4&#8211;5&#8208;step reaction sequences is described. The title compounds was obtained in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield).
  
  
  
  
 
 
  An approach to the synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates on a multigram scale was developed. Two synthetic strategies were evaluated: the first based on the lithiation&#8211;borylation of the corresponding 2&#8208;bromoallyl derivatives, and the other relying on regioselective hydroboration of the appropriate hetera&#8208;substituted enynes. The second method appeared to be more efficient in terms of scalability and substrate scope. Further steps included ring closing&#8208;metathesis, mild palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation with diazomethane, and reaction with KHF2 and furnished the title compounds in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield, 4&#8211;5 steps).

  An approach to 6,6&#8208;difluorospiro[3.3]heptane scaffold &#8211; a conformationally restricted isostere of gem&#8208;difluorocycloalkanes &#8211; is developed. A large array of novel 2&#8208;mono&#8208; and 2,2&#8208;difunctionalized 6,6&#8208;difluorospiro[3.3]heptane building blocks was obtained in multigram scale through the convergent synthesis strategy using a common synthetic intermediate &#8211; 1,1&#8208;bis(bromomethyl)&#8208;3,3&#8208;difluorocyclobutane.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  A convenient methodology for constructing 6,6&#8208;difluorospiro[3.3]heptane scaffold &#8211; a conformationally restricted isoster of gem&#8208;difluorocycloalkanes &#8211; is developed. A large array of novel 2&#8208;mono&#8208; and 2,2&#8208;bifunctionalized difluorospiro[3.3]heptane building blocks was obtained through the convergent synthesis strategy using a common synthetic precursor &#8211; 1,1&#8208;bis(bromomethyl)&#8208;3,3&#8208;difluorocyclobutane. The target compounds and intermediates were prepared by short reaction sequences (6&#8211;10 steps) on a multigram scale (up to 0.47 kg).

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;Sultams by One&#8208;Pot Reductive Cyclization of Cyanoalkylsulfonyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
  A multigram synthesis of spirocyclic &#947;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;sultams is reported, which are advanced building blocks for organic synthesis and drug discovery. The synthesis proceeds through a one&#8208;pot reductive cyclization of cyclic cyano sulfonyl fluorides.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  One&#8208;pot intramolecular cyclization of novel sp3&#8208;enriched cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluorides into spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;sultams is disclosed. The method relies on nitrile group reduction followed by sulfonylation of amino group thus formed upon mild conditions (NaBH4, NiCl2&#183;6H2O in MeOH). Cyclization proceeds smoothly with considerable efficiency (48&#8211;84&#8201;%, 10 examples) on up to 30 g scale. The cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluoride intermediates can be obtained via S&#8208;nucleophilic substitution in &#946;&#8208;functionalized alkanenitriles or double alkylation of &#945;&#8208;alkylthioacetonitrile, followed by oxidative chlorination with Cl2 and further reaction with KHF2. The title mono&#8208; and bifunctional sultams are advanced sp3&#8208;enriched building blocks for drug discovery and organic synthesis providing novel substitution patterns and frameworks mimicking saturated nitrogen heterocycles such as pyrrolidine/pyrrolidone.
