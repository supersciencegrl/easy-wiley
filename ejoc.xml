         <title>An Improved Synthesis of Ionizable Lipids D&#8208;Lin&#8208;KC2&#8208;DMA and D&#8208;Lin&#8208;MC3&#8208;DMA</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new route to ionizable lipid KC2 through the double alkylation of TosMIC with linoleyl tosylate avoids problematic reactions, is higher yielding, and requires three fewer steps. Lipid MC3 is also more efficiently prepared by the new method.

Considerable interest exists in ionizable lipids (ILs) for the delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics. While not a component of a yet&#8208;approved medication, lipid KC2 is especially competent for the delivery of plasmid DNA, consequently it is in high demand on the part of research laboratories worldwide. Lipid MC3, a component of Onpattro, is a benchmark against which the efficacy of new ILs is evaluated. A new route to KC2 and MC3 through the double alkylation of TosMIC with linoleyl tosylate is described. The new synthesis avoids problematic reactions, proceeds in higher overall yield relative to the literature one, and in the case of KC2, involves three fewer steps.

         <title>Photoinduced Reduction and Deuteration of Aryl Halides with NHC&#8208;Boranes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced radical reduction and deuteration of aryliodides and arylbromides is achieved using NHC&#8208;borane without external initiators or photoredox catalysts. The reaction proceeds via aryl radicals and tolerates a broad range of functional groups, offering a practical and versatile approach for dehalogenation and isotopic labeling.

Herein, an operationally simple photoinduced radical reduction of aryliodides and arylbromides using NHC&#8208;borane as a reductant, without external radical initiator or photoredox catalyst, is reported. Mechanistic investigations indicate the key formation of an aryl radical, which undergoes facile reduction by NHC&#8208;borane. The method demonstrates compatibility with a broad range of functional groups, providing a valuable tool for synthesis and isotopic labeling.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Directed Sulfinylation of Distal C(sp3)&#63743;H Bonds by Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox/copper&#8208;cocatalyzed remote C&#63743;H sulfoxidation reaction is described that proceeds through radical&#8208;mediated 1,5&#8722;hydrogen atom transfer. A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction between N&#8722;alkoxypyridinium salts and sodium arylsulfinates gave a series of hydroxy sulfoxide derivatives. This transformation features redox&#8208;neutral conditions, broad functional group compatibility, and excellent site selectivity.

An efficient photoredox&#8208;catalyzed reaction is reported for site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#63743;H sulfoxidation of N&#8208;alkoxypyridinium salts using sodium arylsulfinates as sulfinyl donors. This transformation involves alkoxy&#8208;radical&#8208;directed 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (1,5&#8722;HAT) followed by C(sp3)&#63743;S bond formation. A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven, copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling strategy enables the synthesis of a series of hydroxyl sulfoxide derivatives. This methodology establishes a novel synthetic platform for rapid construction of sulfoxide&#8208;containing molecular architectures, demonstrating remarkable functional group compatibility and predictable regioselectivity.

         <title>Rapid Mechanochemical Synthesis of Azosulfones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid synthesis of azosulfones can be accomplished in a vibrational mechanical mill, giving up to quantitative yields in as little as 30&#8201;min. The tolerance of the method is demonstrates on a broad substrate scope and is successfully used to produce 30 different products. Spectroscopic and computational studies provide insight into the process and its selectivity.

Azosulfones represent a potent and stable surrogate for diazonium salts. Their wide application in C&#8211;H functionalizations catalyzed by transition metals and visible light is well&#8208;known in organic chemistry. Here, a single&#8208;step mechanochemical synthesis of azosulfones is reported, starting from readily available precursors, which has high conversion efficacy &#8722;80%&#8211;99% isolated yields are obtained in most cases. A substrate scope of 30 different compounds is obtained. This method requires no solvent, it is quick and has potential in terms of scalability and tolerance toward a broad range of functional groups, which makes it attractive for synthesis. Spectroscopic and computational studies are performed to explain the observed reactivity patterns.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Induced the Radical Cascade Cyclization of 2&#8208;Isocyanobiaryls via 1,2&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenanthridines, as important structural moieties of many naturally occurring products, pharmaceuticals, and functionalized polycyclic heteroarenes, have attracted considerable attention among chemists due to their significant potentials in pharmaceutical and material chemistry. Herein, a visible light&#8208;induced radical cascade cyclization of 2&#8208;isocyanobiaryls via 1,2&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer is described to rapidly synthesize phenanthridines under mild conditions. 

Phenanthridines, as important structural moieties of many naturally occurring products, pharmaceuticals, and functionalized polycyclic heteroarenes, have attracted considerable attention among chemists due to their significant potential in pharmaceutical and material chemistry. The hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process provides an important strategy for selective C&#63743;H functionalization. However, net 1,2&#8208;HAT processes have been reported and applied infrequently compared to the popularity of 1,5&#8208;HAT processes. Herein, a visible light&#8208;induced radical cascade cyclization of 2&#8208;isocyanobiaryls via 1,2&#8208;HAT is described to rapidly synthesize phenanthridines under mild conditions. This approach represents an example of radical cascade cyclization of 2&#8208;isocyanobiaryls via infrequent 1,2&#8208;HAT to access the phenanthridine core. This protocol features a 1,2&#8208;HAT, a radical cascade process, broad substrate scope, and good functional group compatibility under mild and oxidant&#8208;free reaction conditions.

An efficient method for the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of 3&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;5R&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoles from acyl hydrazides and methyl phthalimidoacetimidate is proposed. The reaction conditions are optimized to control the cyclization pathway, minimizing the formation of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole by&#8208;products. The intramolecular cyclization mechanism of amidrazones is discussed on the basis of quantum chemical calculations.

A series of 3&#8208;(aminomethyl)&#8208;5R&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoles is synthesized in gram&#8208;scale quantities starting from N&#8208;(cyanomethyl)phthalimide and carboxylic acid hydrazides. The intramolecular cyclization of amidrazones to give 1,2,4&#8208;triazolines is the key step. The main side products are 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazoles formed by a concurrent intramolecular condensation. Their amount depends on the steric and electronic nature of the substituent in the initial carboxylic acid hydrazide. Additionally, aminomethyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole is modified by the introduction of different substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4 of the heterocyclic scaffold. Quantum chemical calculations demonstrate a fine balance of activation energy values for the key stages in the formation of the two isomeric products. In contrast to the previously derived mechanism, the participation of water, not ammonia, is required as a&#8201;factor reducing the activation barriers for both reaction pathways.

         <title>Synthesis of Bis&#8208;Arylated Squaryls via Addition of Organocopper Species onto Squaryl Dichlorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple protocol for the iterative and selective introduction of diverse substituents relayed through organocopper chemistry has been developed, providing access to sophisticated bis&#8208;functionalized squaryl scaffolds. This provides a unified approach to access four&#8208;membered rings possessing useful functional handles.

Squaric chlorides serve as convenient, readily available building blocks in the synthetic path toward unsymmetrically substituted squaryls. The use of in&#8201;situ generated arylcopper reagents enables precise, selective control over stoichiometry and facilitates the creation of a diverse library of sophisticated structures.

         <title>Escape from Flatland: Pericyclic Reactions and Rearrangements of Diazofluorene with Biarylcyclooctynes for the Generation of Helicene&#8208;Like Phenanthro&#8208;Pyrazoles</title>

         <dc:description>
Flat molecules will remain flat no longer! The journey of two planar molecules&#8212;armed with just a few pericyclic transition states&#8212;into the 3D world of spirocycles and heterohelicenes is reported. Only the thermodynamically stable will survive!

Herein, the voyage of two flat, highly unsaturated systems into the third dimension is reported. Specifically, the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of 9&#8208;diazofluorene with a rapidly growing class of strained dipolarophile&#8212;biarylcyclooctynes&#8212;are investigated. It is found that the initial spirocyclic 3H&#8208;pyrazole cycloadducts are isolable and can be subjected to controllable [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic shifts. These van Alphen&#8211;H&#252;ttel rearrangements generate either the metastable 4H&#8208;pyrazoles&#8212;another spirocyclic fused&#8208;ring system with a highly contorted structure&#8212;or the thermodynamically favored 1H&#8208;pyrazoles. The 1H&#8208;pyrazoles display extended conjugation and can be classified as [5]&#8208;helicenes containing a phenanthro&#8208;pyrazole fused to a dihydro&#8208;cyclooctatetraene. Overall, these studies provide a modular framework to control heteroatom placement, ring size, and ring fusion in the syntheses of carbon&#8208;rich materials.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Pyridones are pivotal building blocks for the synthesis of bioactive nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C6&#8208;selective C&#8211;H heteroarylation of 2&#8208;pyridones has been developed by employing cyclic iodonium ylides as carbene precursors. The versatility and broad applicability of this method are highlighted by the efficient synthesis of diverse compounds featuring both 2&#8208;pyridone&#8208;pyridine and cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl structural motifs.

2&#8208;Pyridone is a crucial building block in bioactive natural products and serves as a vital intermediate for the synthesis of bioactive nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. Recent advancements in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization have enabled the direct modification of 2&#8208;pyridones, circumventing the need for prefunctionalization. Herein, a Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed, C6&#8208;selective C&#8211;H heteroarylation of 2&#8208;pyridones using cyclic iodonium ylides as carbene precursors is reported.

Selective C&#63743;F Bond Activation in 1,1&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes: Synthesis of Functionalized Monofluoroalkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treatment of 2&#8208;aryloxy&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes with Me2AlCl promotes fluoride abstraction, followed by cyclopropane ring opening, to generate &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated oxocarbenium ions. These cations are trapped with nucleophiles such as arenes and silyl enol ethers to provide functionalized 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1&#8208;alkenes. The instability of vinyl cations prevents further fluoride abstraction, resulting in completely selective C&#63743;F bond activation.

Functionalized monofluoroalkenes (3&#8208;arylated and 5&#8208;oxygenated 1&#8208;aryloxy&#8208;2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1&#8208;alkenes) are synthesized via selective activation of the C&#63743;F bonds in 2&#8208;aryloxy&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes that are readily prepared from aryl vinyl ethers. Treatment of these difluorocyclopropanes with Me2AlCl promotes fluoride abstraction followed by cyclopropane ring opening to generate &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated oxocarbenium ions. These cations are subsequently trapped with nucleophiles, such as arenes and silyl enol ethers (Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208; and aldol&#8208;type reactions), to provide functionalized 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1&#8208;alkenes. Because of the instability of vinyl cations, further fluoride abstraction is suppressed, resulting in completely selective C&#63743;F bond activation.

A nickel&#8208;catalyzed carboalkoxylation and borylalkoxylation of the biphenylene C&#63743;C &#963;&#8208;bond has been developed to form the corresponding ring&#8208;opening oxygenative difunctionalization products. The key to success is the use of acetal&#8208;based, electron&#8208;deficient peroxides, which enable the otherwise challenging C&#63743;O cross coupling with nickel catalysts even under photo&#8208;free, thermal reaction conditions.

         <title>Exploration of Structure&#8211;Property Relationships by Altering Glycol Backbone Unsaturation (Double/Triple Bonds) in Furan&#8208;Based Polyesters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores how adding unsaturated groups to bio&#8208;based furanic polyesters can change their stiffness and heat resistance. While this offers new possibilities, it also needs careful control during production. It is shown that solution polycondensation works well for making these materials and offers a path toward more flexible, stable, and ecofriendly polymers.

This study highlights both the challenges and opportunities associated with developing bio&#8208;based furanic polyesters. Incorporating unsaturated moieties into glycol chains effectively modulates polymer rigidity and thermal properties, though it requires careful optimization of polymerization conditions. The findings demonstrate the viability of solution polycondensation for synthesizing high&#8208;quality FDCA&#8208;based polyesters with unsaturated glycols and pave the way for further investigations into polymer design strategies that balance flexibility, thermal stability, and environmental sustainability.

         <title>White Light&#8208;Induced Slow Kinetics Generation of Arynes</title>

2&#8208;(3&#8208;Acetyl&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;triazen&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzoic acids are synthesized from anthranilic acids, enabling the generation of arynes under white light irradiation. These aryne photoprecursors participate in [3&#8201;+&#8201;2] and [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloadditions, as well as in metal&#8208;free C&#63743;N couplings, with good functional group tolerance. Their utility is demonstrated in the synthesis of an advanced intermediate for aporphine alkaloids.

Herein, 2&#8208;(3&#8208;acetyl&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;triazen&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzoic acids are synthesized from anthranilic acids, including two new derivatives, without the use of strong bases. These compounds allow the slow and controlled generation of arynes via a white light&#8208;induced process, which participates in [3&#8201;+&#8201;2] and [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition reactions, as well as in a metal&#8208;free C&#63743;N bond formation reaction. This chemistry, which tolerates sulfur&#8208;, boron&#8208;, and silicon&#8208;containing compounds, is successfully performed on a scale of up to 1.5&#8201;mmol. A radical mechanism for the photogeneration of arynes is proposed based on a control reaction using TEMPO. In addition, the application of triazenylbenzoic acids is evaluated through the synthesis of a dehydroaporphine compound, which is an advanced synthetic intermediate for the synthesis of aporphine alkaloids.

         <title>Elucidating the Mechanism and Origin of Site Selectivity in the Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#63743;H Functionalization of a Thioamide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The detailed reaction mechanism of the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#63743;H activation/amidation of a thioamide has been extensively investigated using density functional theory methods. The origin of site selectivity in the C(sp3)&#63743;H activation step is elucidated through structural analysis.

In the present study, the mechanism of cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#63743;H activation/amidation reaction of thioamide has been investigated using density functional theory. The computational results indicate that the activation of the primary C(sp3)&#63743;H bond is more energetically favorable than the secondary C(sp3)&#63743;H bond. The formation of a five&#8208;membered cobaltacycle is the key intermediate for the amidation reaction with dioxazolone. Based on the calculations, the amidation reaction of cobaltacycle intermediate proceeds through the sequential stepwise decarboxylation, migratory insertion, and proto&#8208;demetalation processes.

     alt="Elucidating the Mechanism and Origin of Site Selectivity in the Cobalt-Catalyzed C(sp3)&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H Functionalization of a Thioamide"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The detailed reaction mechanism of the cobalt-catalyzed C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H activation/amidation of a thioamide has been extensively investigated using density functional theory methods. The origin of site selectivity in the C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H activation step is elucidated through structural analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the present study, the mechanism of cobalt-catalyzed C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H activation/amidation reaction of thioamide has been investigated using density functional theory. The computational results indicate that the activation of the primary C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H bond is more energetically favorable than the secondary C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H bond. The formation of a five-membered cobaltacycle is the key intermediate for the amidation reaction with dioxazolone. Based on the calculations, the amidation reaction of cobaltacycle intermediate proceeds through the sequential stepwise decarboxylation, migratory insertion, and proto-demetalation processes. The extended transition state-natural orbitals for chemical valence analysis verify that the primary C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H activation occurs predominantly due to the stronger interfragment interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A cationic complex, [(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)RuLCl]+[PF6]&#8722;(1) {L&#8201;=&#8201;di(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)amine}, has been synthesized from the reaction of [(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)RuCl2]2 with di(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)amine in acetonitrile. The complex has been characterized by 1H and13C nuclear magnetic resonance&#160;spectroscopy and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. Additionally, the complex has been structurally characterized. This complex has been used as a homogeneous catalyst for the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones with benzylic alcohols as an alkylating agent in toluene at 120&#8201;&#176;C in the presence of Cs2CO3. The scope of the reaction extends to the synthesis of a fluorescent &#945;&#8208;alkylated product. Mechanistic insights suggest that the water molecule generated in&#8201;situ during the aldol condensation facilitates the reactivation of the catalytic species, thereby sustaining the catalytic cycle.

Visible Light&#8208;Induced Singlet&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Substituted Benzo[c]chromeno[4,3,2&#8208;gh]phenanthridines&#8224;</title>

A visible light&#8208;induced singlet&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated Na2 eosin Y&#8208;catalyzed single&#8208;step synthesis of benzo[c]chromeno[4,3,2&#8208;gh]phenanthridine derivatives is reported that involves a metal&#8208;free oxidative hetero&#8208;crosscoupling reaction followed by an aromatization reaction.

Visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted environmentally benign synthesis of various 9&#8208;alkylbenzo[c]chromeno[4,3,2&#8208;gh]phenanthridine derivatives in the presence of 5&#8201;mol % disodium salt of eosin Y (EY) as photocatalyst is reported from 2&#8208;(7,8,9,10&#8208;tetrahydrobenzo[c]phe&#8208;nanthridin&#8208;6&#8208;yl) phenol derivatives, which were prepared through a three&#8208;component reaction. In the present protocol, EY&#8208;photosensitized singlet oxygen (1O2) promotes intramolecular cyclization through an oxidative hetero&#8208;crosscoupling reaction, followed by aromatization to provide the final product in a single step, which has not been reported earlier. The mechanism of the reaction was established through density functional theory calculation and by trapping of the oxygen radical intermediate A with Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT), which was confirmed through 1H, 13C NMR spectra, and HRMS. This process forms the highly fused hexacyclic heteroaromatics without requiring any metal catalyst or dehydrogenating agent. This intramolecular photocyclization, through the triplet energy transfer process, is a fascinating example of the oxidative coupling reaction via distal sp3&#8208;C&#63743;H.

         <title>Sustainable Electrochemical Access to &#945;&#8208;Thiocyanate Ketones: A Metal&#8208;Free Protocol Utilizing Ammonium Thiocyanate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utilization of ammonium thiocyanate has been developed for the electrosynthesis of &#945;&#8208;thiocyanate ketones under environmental&#8208;friendly conditions, addressing limitations of conventional oxidative methods.

A robust and environmentally benign electrochemical method for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;thiocyanate ketones from aromatic ketones is reported. The protocol utilizes ammonium thiocyanate as both the thiocyanate source and supporting electrolyte in an undivided cell with platinum electrodes and an acetonitrile/water/sulfuric acid solvent system. This metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free transformation proceeds under mild conditions, exhibiting broad substrate scope, excellent functional group compatibility, and amenability to gram&#8208;scale operations. The developed approach offers a sustainable and practical alternative for accessing these valuable thiocyanated carbonyl compounds, addressing limitations of conventional oxidative methods.

         <title>Boron Difluoride Complexes with N,S&#8208;Schiff&#8208;base Ligands: Synthesis, Structure, and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron difluoride complexes with N,S&#8208;Schiff&#8208;base ligands exhibit distorted six&#8208;membered chelate structures due to sulfur coordination, leading to redshifted absorption and emission compared to N,O&#8208;chelate analogs. These results highlight their potential as tunable optical materials.

Boron difluoride complexes incorporating N,S&#8208;Schiff&#8208;base ligands are synthesized, and their structural and photophysical properties are investigated.

         <title>Basicity and Lipophilicity of gem&#8208;Difluorinated Saturated Bicyclic Amines: Advanced Building Blocks for Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed study of the physicochemical properties of gem&#8208;difluorinated bicyclic amines is reported. pKa and LogP measurements reveal interesting trends affected by the fluorination pattern of the compound and the bicyclic system itself, which are partially rationalized through molecular electrostatic potential surface analysis.

The impact of gem&#8208;difluorination on the physicochemical properties of bicyclic saturated amines with 6&#8211;8 atoms in the largest ring is studied. The fluorination effect on the acidity of protonated species (pKa) aligns with predictions based on the inductive effect of the electron&#8208;deficient substituent. In contrast, lipophilicity (LogP) could either increase or decrease due to gem&#8208;difluorination. The observed effect depends on the number of vicinal C&#63743;H bonds relative to the fluorine atoms, but it is also influenced by their relative spatial orientation and the structure of the bicyclic core itself.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Arylacetyl Thioesters from Benzyl Chlorides and Thioformates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thioester transfer strategy employing thioformates as dual sulfur/carbonyl sources enables efficient thiocarbonylation of benzyl chlorides. This method bypasses toxic CO and malodorous thiols, offering broad substrate scope and mild conditions for diverse thioester synthesis. The protocol enhances practicality in organic and biomolecular applications.

Thioesters are vital synthons in organic synthesis and biological processes, yet their synthesis often&#8201;faces challenges such as the use of toxic CO, malodorous thiophenols, and restricted substrate scope. To address these challenges, this study develops a thioester transfer strategy using thioformates as both sulfur and carbonyl sources, which enables the thiocarbonylation of benzyl chlorides. This approach facilitates the successful coupling of thioformates with benzyl chloride, providing efficient access to diverse thioesters. This advancement broadens the substrate scope and enhances the practicality of thioester synthesis in organic chemistry.

         <title>Electrochemical Tandem Self&#8208;Coupling/Selenylation of Acetonitrile toward Highly Functionalized Tetrasubstituted Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical tandem self&#8208;coupling/selenylation of acetonitrile delivers (Z)&#8208;tetrasubstituted alkenes with amino, cyano, and seleno groups. This potassium iodide&#8208;mediated, metal/oxidant&#8208;free protocol features simple operation, high chemoselectivity, and excellent stereoselectivity.

Herein, an electrochemical tandem reaction that integrates acetonitrile self&#8208;coupling with selenylation to construct densely functionalized tetrasubstituted alkenes bearing amino, cyano, and seleno groups from readily available acetonitrile and diselenides is reported. Employing potassium iodide as a redox mediator under mild, metal&#8208;free, and oxidant&#8208;free conditions, this sustainable strategy leverages the synergistic effect of electrochemical oxidation and iodine catalysis to achieve inert C(sp3)&#63743;H bond activation of acetonitrile. The transformation exhibits good stereoselectivity along with substrate scope across diverse aryl and alkyl selenides.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Reduction of &#946;&#8208;Nitroacrylates via Hydrogen Atom Transfer Promoted by Tetrabutylammonium Decatungstate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrabutylammonium decatungstate is hereby applied as efficient photocatalyst for the hydrogenation or deuteration of &#946;&#8208;nitroacrylates via hydrogen atom transfer. The protocol affords the desired products in good yields, with short reaction time, and demonstates a good functional group compatibility.

A photocatalyzed reduction of the C&#63742;C double bond in &#946;&#8208;nitroacrylates under flow conditions is developed. The reaction takes place upon irradiation at 390&#8201;nm in the presence of tetrabutylammonium decatungstate and requires &#947;&#8208;terpinene as a hydrogen source. Products are obtained in good yields, and various functional groups are tolerated, such as unconjugated double bonds, benzyl groups and carbonyls, thus demonstrating a substantial chemoselectivity.

Sonochemical multicomponent synthesis of 2&#8208;(2&#180;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine&#160; analogs with an intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonded eight&#8208;membered ring exhibiting an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer fluorescent process.

Multicomponent reactions are excellent tools to generate complex structures with broad chemical diversity and fluorescent properties. The sonochemical multicomponent one&#8208;pot synthesis of novel organic luminescent heterocycles, such as 2&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine (2&#8208;HPIP) analogs, is described. The Groebke&#8211;Blackburn&#8211;Bienaym&#233; reaction (GBBR) affords good to excellent yields (75&#8211;95%). Notably, the compound 4b forms an intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonded eight&#8208;membered ring (8&#8208;MR) in the crystalline state and is luminescent in this phase; in solution, this compound exhibits dual band emission with a very large Stokes shift of 18&#8201;382&#8201;cm&#8722;1 attributed to an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process. Time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) and additional calculations are performed to evaluate the HOMO&#8211;LUMO distributions and theoretical absorption spectra, being in agreement with the experimental data. Additionally, the TD&#8208;DFT calculations in solution (chloroform) show the ESIPT process and 8&#8208;MR formation become thermodynamically favorable in 4b. This work represents the first synthesis of prompts feasibility ESIPT heterocyclic luminescent materials via an eight&#8208;membered ring (8&#8208;MR) with an N&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#63743;O connection.

         <title>Efficient Route for Construction of Fluorinated Isoxazolines through Base&#8208;Mediated Fluorinated Amino Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A base&#8208;mediated, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free reaction between ethyl 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;((diphenylmethylene)amino)&#8208;3,3&#8208;difluoropropanoate and nitrones facilitates a rapid, one&#8208;step synthesis of fluorinated isoxazolidines. This streamlined protocol proceeds under mild conditions to construct the valuable heterocyclic scaffold efficiently, with broad substrate scope and high practicality.

Isoxazolines have attracted widespread attention for the development of anticancer, antiviral, and anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs due to their unique electronic properties and conformational rigidity. However, the application of fluorinated isoxazolines in the development of innovative drugs has been constrained by the lack of appropriate synthetic methods for introducing fluorine atoms into the isoxazole ring skeleton. In this article, a rapid synthesis of fluoroisoxazolines is reported based on a pre&#8208;functionalization strategy: ethyl 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;((diphenylmethylene)amino)&#8208;3,3&#8208;difluoropropionate is reacted with imine oxides under alkaline conditions to efficiently construct the fluoroisoxazolidine skeleton in one step without the need for transition metal catalysts. This simple operation is performed under mild green reaction conditions, offering a concise and efficient pathway for the synthesis of fluoroisoxazololidine compounds.

The method features broad substrate scope, high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity, and functional group tolerance, offering a streamlined route to functionalized heterocycles under mild conditions.

This study presents a novel ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed method for the regioselective ortho&#8208;sulphonamidation of benzo[b][1,4]oxazin&#8208;2&#8208;ones. Utilizing sulfonyl azides, which release benign nitrogen gas as a byproduct, this approach achieves high yields and excellent ortho&#8208;selectivity in C&#63743;H functionalization. The protocol exhibits a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and operational simplicity. Optimization studies and control experiments support a plausible reaction mechanism involving a ruthenium&#8208;metallacycle intermediate. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis demonstrates the practicality and potential of the method to access biologically relevant molecules, significantly expanding C&#63743;H functionalization in heterocyclic chemistry.

         <title>Organocatalytic Halogenation of Aromatic and Heteroaromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to their importance in organic synthesis and the design of drugs and materials containing haloarenes or haloheteroarenes, this review highlights recent advances in their synthesis via organocatalysis. It covers not only classical challenges like deactivated systems, regioselectivity, and mild conditions but also advances in enantioselective halogenations, novel halogen sources, and sustainable methods.

The halogenation of aromatic and heteroaromatic systems has attracted considerable attention in recent decades owing to the importance of haloaromatics in biologically relevant compounds and their role as essential building blocks for more complex systems. In recent years, various research groups have explored the challenge of developing new synthetic methodologies for electrophilic halogenation. Nevertheless, these methods continue to encounter several challenges, such as waste products from halogenating agents, toxic or contaminating reagents, and problems with low regioselectivity, with polyhalogenation&#8212;often the predominant side reaction&#8212;occurring in some cases. In this context, organocatalysis has emerged as a promising approach to address these limitations. This review highlights key organocatalytic strategies reported in the last 14&#8201;years and discusses experimental aspects, mechanisms, and selectivity issues in chlorination, bromination, fluorination, and iodination of aromatic systems.

         <title>Intramolecular Azide&#8211;Alkene Cycloaddition&#8212;The Logothetis Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As originally reported by Logothetis, alkenyl azides cyclize smoothly on warming, leading, depending on substitution, to cyclic imines or bicyclic aziridines. These intermediates can then be carried on to other products. This review summarizes the many ways the Logothetis reaction has been employed in target&#8208;directed synthesis.

The assembly of cyclic amines is fundamental to medicinal chemistry. While intramolecular azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition is widely practiced, intramolecular azide&#8211;alkene cycloaddition is much less used, even though it has been known since 1965. This review is an overview of the applications of intramolecular azide&#8211;alkene cycloaddition in target&#8208;directed synthesis since that time.

         <title>Hydrogen Peroxide&#8208;Responsive Aminoferrocene Prodrugs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve sensitivity toward H2O2, the boronic acid pinacol ester in known aminoferrocene&#8208;based anticancer prodrug 13b is replaced with an &#945;&#8208;ketamide fragment to obtain prodrug 2a and some of its N&#8208;alkylated derivatives. 2a exhibits substantially improved cytotoxicity in&#8201;vitro toward ovarian cancer A2780 and Burkitt's lymphoma BL&#8208;2 cells. Its mode of action relies on intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species.

Aminoferrocene (AF)&#8208;based prodrugs are activated in cancer cells through reactions with H2O2 and other reactive oxygen species (ROS), generating electron&#8208;rich AF's. These, in turn, induce the production of highly toxic O2&#8722; and HO&#183;, leading to cancer cell death. Effective activation of these prodrugs depends on their ability to target intracellular organelles rich in ROS, as nontargeted prodrugs are practically inactive. In this study, the boronic acid pinacol ester&#8212;previously used as a ROS&#8208;trigger&#8212;is replaced with an &#945;&#8208;ketoamide fragment, which is more selective and sensitive to H2O2. This modification enhances the anticancer efficacy of untargeted AF prodrugs, reducing the IC50 from 23.9&#8211;35.5&#8201;&#956;M (previously reported prodrug 13b) to 5&#8211;6.4&#8201;&#956;M (new prodrug 2a) in human ovarian cancer A2780 and Burkitt's lymphoma BL&#8208;2 cells. Further analysis confirms that the anticancer effect of 2a is driven by its ability to markedly increase intracellular ROS levels in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria.

&lt;p&gt;To improve sensitivity toward H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the boronic acid pinacol ester in known aminoferrocene-based anticancer prodrug &lt;b&gt;13b&lt;/b&gt; is replaced with an &#945;-ketamide fragment to obtain prodrug &lt;b&gt;2a&lt;/b&gt; and some of its N-alkylated derivatives. &lt;b&gt;2a&lt;/b&gt; exhibits substantially improved cytotoxicity in&#8201;vitro toward ovarian cancer A2780 and Burkitt's lymphoma BL-2 cells. Its mode of action relies on intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aminoferrocene (AF)-based prodrugs are activated in cancer cells through reactions with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other reactive oxygen species (ROS), generating electron-rich AF's. These, in turn, induce the production of highly toxic O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and HO&#183;, leading to cancer cell death. Effective activation of these prodrugs depends on their ability to target intracellular organelles rich in ROS, as nontargeted prodrugs are practically inactive. In this study, the boronic acid pinacol ester&#8212;previously used as a ROS-trigger&#8212;is replaced with an &#945;-ketoamide fragment, which is more selective and sensitive to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This modification enhances the anticancer efficacy of untargeted AF prodrugs, reducing the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; from 23.9&#8211;35.5&#8201;&#956;M (previously reported prodrug &lt;b&gt;13b&lt;/b&gt;) to 5&#8211;6.4&#8201;&#956;M (new prodrug &lt;b&gt;2a&lt;/b&gt;) in human ovarian cancer A2780 and Burkitt's lymphoma BL-2 cells.

         <title>Introduction of Structural Diversity at the C2 Position of Unsaturated Iminosugars through Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 32, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To increase the structural diversity of iminosugars at the C2 position, protected 2&#8208;iodoiminoglycals, efficiently synthesized from sugar lactams, are subjected to mild palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Successful aminocarbonylation, arylation, and phosphonylation provide a range of C2&#8208;functionalized iminoglycals, which, once O&#8208;deprotected, are tested as glycosidase inhibitors.

To vary the functionality of iminosugars at the C2 position, protected 2&#8208;iodoiminoglycals in the D&#8208;gluco, D&#8208;galacto, and D&#8208;xylo series are efficiently synthesized from sugar lactams. Their mild palladium&#8208;catalyzed aminocarbonylation, arylation, and phosphonylation are successful and provide a range of C2&#8208;functionalized iminoglycals in good yields. Two of these compounds are O&#8208;deprotected to afford 1,2&#8208;unsaturated iminosugars that prove to be modest inhibitors of glycosidases.

         <dc:description>
An electrochemical organic method for the direct synthesis of bis(indolyl)methane (BIM) derivatives is presented, with the reaction of hydrazones and indoles. This electrochemical approach, characterized by simple and mild reaction conditions, provides an operationally straightforward and practically applicable route to valuable indole derivatives, utilizing readily available raw materials.

An electrochemical organic method for the direct synthesis of bis(indolyl)methane (BIM) derivatives is presented, with the reaction of hydrazones and indoles. This developed approach is effective for aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroaromatic aldehydes, which react with a range of electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor indoles to produce the desired BIMs in good to excellent yields. Additionally, a potential antiobesity drug is also successfully synthesized with various indole derivatives under the influence of an electric current, and the transformation of BIMs demonstrates the application potential of this protocol.

         <title>Nitrile N&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Based Fluorescent Probe to Impart Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission to Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 32, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent probes have been used extensively in chemical biology. However, there are a few fluorescence probes that covalently bind to less polar compounds without a catalyst. Herein, the design, synthesis, and click reaction of pyrene&#8208;based nitrile N&#8208;oxide (Pyrene&#8208;NO) are reported. The optical properties of the adducts of Pyrene&#8208;NO indicate that Pyrene&#8208;NO imparts the aggregation&#8208;induced emission behaviors to alkene&#8208;containing compounds.

Fluorescent probes have been used extensively in chemical biology, allowing the visual observation of bioactive compounds. While many variations of fluorescent probes that react to polar functional groups have been developed, there are few fluorescent probes that directly modify less polar compounds. In this article, pyrene&#8208;containing nitrile N&#8208;oxide (Pyrene&#8208;NO) has been designed and synthesized as a fluorescent dye clickable to alkenes without a catalyst. Pyrene&#8208;NO shows good reactivity to a terminal alkene, a polymer methacrylate, and a natural unsaturated lipid with internal alkenes to give the corresponding cycloadducts with pyrene as the fluorescent dye. The cycloadducts show aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behaviors in a poor solvent. While the adducts to 1&#8208;hexene or polymer methacrylate show AIE in water, the adduct to castor oil, as a natural glycerolipid, shows AIE in MeOH. The AIE behaviors are evidenced by the dependence of fluorescence intensity on the concentration and the enhanced fluorescence at 77&#8201;K compared with that at room temperature. It is suggested that the aggregation of the cycloadduct in the poor solvent would kinetically suppress the nonradiative deactivation of the excited state of pyrene based on interactions with oxygen, leading to an increase in fluorescence intensity.

A domino reaction of diynone and cyclic &#946;&#8208;keto ester has been disclosed. This reaction provides a new strategy for the synthesis of a series of furan&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one fused seven&#8208;, eight&#8208;, or nine&#8208;membered ring with good stereoselectivity and atom economy. Mechanistically, this reaction involves sequential Michael addition, intramolecular cyclization, ring opening, isomerization, anti&#8208;Michael addition and protonation.

         <title>An Efficient Asymmetric Synthesis of Finerenone via Evans&#8217; Chiral Auxiliary</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 32, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study demonstrates Evans&#8217; (R)&#8208;4&#8208;benzyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazolidinone auxiliary enables efficient asymmetric synthesis of finerenone, achieving stereoselective naphthyridine core construction with 86:14 dr and 80% yield. Subsequent ammonia&#8208;mediated transamidation of the ethyl ester completes finerenone formation.

This article reports a new application of Evans&#8217; chiral auxiliary for an efficient asymmetric synthesis of finerenone. This new application successfully achieves the key step of stereoselective construction of the naphthyridine core of finerenone, with a high diastereomeric ratio (dr 86:14) and an 80% yield of the desired product via Evans&#8217; chiral (R)&#8208;4&#8208;benzyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazolidinone. The downstream transamidation of ethyl ester, with ammonia, leads to the formation of finerenone.

         <title>Photoinduced Cascade Cyclization of Ortho&#8208;Alkynylanilines to Access Dithiocyanated or Selenocyanated Indoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 32, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diverse indole derivatives are obtained by a cascade process involving dithiocyanation or selenocyanation and cyclization of ortho&#8208;alkynylanilines under mild conditions with NH4SCN/KSeCN. Experiments are undertaken to shed light on the radical reaction mechanism and investigate the versatility of the transformation.

A photoinduced cyclization and dithiocyanation/selenocyanation of ortho&#8208;alkynylanilines with NH4SCN/KSeCN provide various dithiocyanated and selenocyanated indoles. The structure of the indole framework is confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. In addition, a series of experiments investigating scale&#8208;up, other starting materials, and radical inhibition/capture are carried out to study the application and reaction process of this cascade system.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free HFIP&#8208;Promoted Synthesis of Benzhydryl Derivatives from Stilbenes as Masked Electrophiles under Oxidative Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 32, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An umpolung strategy allowing the use of stilbenes as electrophiles in substitution reactions is developed that relies on a combination of m&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid and hexafluoroisopropanol. This new step&#8208;economic approach gives rise to benzhydryl derivatives by the use of different nitrogenated, oxygenated, and sulfur&#8208; and carbon&#8208;based nucleophiles.

Benzhydryl derivatives are synthesized by a new strategy involving the use of stilbenes as an electrophilic reaction partner through umpolung reactivity in a nucleophilic substitution reaction. The transformation, which requires oxidative treatment with meta&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid and the presence of 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) as an essential solvent and reaction promoter, occurs through multiple consecutive steps. Under these conditions, different benzhydryl derivatives are synthesized by coupling stilbenes with a variety of nitrogenated, oxygenated, and sulfur&#8208; and carbon&#8208;based nucleophiles.

         <title>The Dihydroindeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene Core: From Syntheses to Properties and Potential Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 32, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the latest research progress in synthesis and application of variously decorated aromatic compounds possessing the indeno[2.1&#8208;c]fluorene scaffold is summarized. In addition to covering synthetic endeavors, their transformation to other structurally related aromatic compounds and their physical properties and possible applications are also outlined.

In the last decade, substances possessing the dihydroindeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene scaffold show interesting photophysical properties and other potential applications in electronics. The aforementioned compounds belong to the family of five regioisomeric dihydroindenofluorenes, but unlike other ones, they possess angular or, in the case of higher congeners, helical shape. This review is mainly focused on various synthetic approaches to compounds possessing the dihydroindeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene scaffold and their conversions to other polyaromatic hydrocarbons. In addition, their physicochemical and photophysical properties, and current and/or potential applications are briefly described as well.

         <title>Organocatalytic Asymmetric Cyclization Reactions with &#947;&#8208;Hydroxyenones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 32, August 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of recent advancements in &#947;&#8208;hydroxyenone&#8208;based organocatalytic asymmetric cyclization techniques is given in this review paper. Because &#947;&#8208;hydroxyenones are bifunctional, they are an effective building block for creating oxa&#8208;heterocycles.

This review article provides an overview of the recent developments in organocatalytic asymmetric cyclization strategies utilizing &#947;&#8208;hydroxyenones.&#8201; Due to the bifunctional nature of &#947;&#8208;hydroxyenones, it is a powerful building block for synthesizing oxygen&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. The cyclization strategies are systematically categorized based on the nature of the organocatalysts employed: (i) chiral prolinol analogs, which obtain tetrahydrofuran&#8208;fused 3,4&#8208;dihydrocoumarins and 2,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted tetrahydrofurans; (ii) chiral bifunctional squaramides, affording diverse spirocyclic frameworks such as spiro&#8208;tetrahydrofuran&#8208;pyrazolones, morpholinones, and oxindole&#8208;derived systems; (iii) chiral bifunctional thioureas, which forms 1,3&#8208;dioxolanes, oxazolidines, and cyclic acetals; (iv) multifunctional modular organocatalysts, affording enantioenriched &#945;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones; and (v) other chiral organocatalysts which cannot be grouped in previous categories such as Song's chiral oligoethylene glycol as a cation&#8208;binding catalyst leads to the generation of chiral 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazinanes.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Ortho&#8208;Deuteration of Electron&#8208;Deficient N&#8208;Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herin, the metal&#8208;free, selective deuteration of electron&#8208;deficient N&#8208;heteroaromatics is reported using O&#8208;carbamate and carboxamide ortho&#8208;directing groups (DGs), lithium 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide as the base, and D2O as a green source of D+. The substrate scope includes 10 small molecule N&#8208;heteroaromatic compounds and two pharmaceutically relevant synthetic precursors for which the DGs can be manipulated to form chemical libraries of compounds.

Selectively deuterated electron&#8208;deficient N&#8208;containing heteroaromatic systems can enable modulation of metabolism with enhanced therapeutic efficacy in pharmaceuticals and improved properties and stability of functional materials, e.g., imaging dyes, light emitters, and catalysts. Current synthetic approaches to selectively deuterate N&#8208;heteroaromatic rings largely rely on transition metal (TM) catalysts, prone to inducing over&#8208;deuteration while posing several environmental and sustainability concerns and requiring onerous purification to remove metal traces. In this work, an alternative TM&#8208;free approach is reported based on directed ortho metalation, which employs lithium 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide (LiTMP) such as the base and D2O as a green and accessible electrophilic source of deuterium (D). Since the O&#8208;carbamate and carboxamide directing groups (DGs) can be transformed into other functional groups or cross&#8208;coupled with aromatic or aliphatic moieties, this enables a modular approach to synthesize a series of drug analogs, as exemplified by the synthesis of a precursor to momelotinib&#8208;d1&#160;and the key building block pyrimidine&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic&#8208;5&#8208;d1 acid.

         <title>Regiocontrolled Cleavage of Dialkyl Ethers Using Regenerative Borates as a Sustainable Alternative to Boron Trichloride</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of triaryl borates for highly selective ether cleavage is described. The borate is regenerable from the aqueous extract of a previous ether cleavage reaction without repurification, making use of low toxicity boron and phenolic waste. Such strategies for C&#63743;O cleavage are expected to be broadly applicable to synthetic manipulations where management of waste is critical.

Ethers are ubiquitous functional groups in natural products, surfactants, and materials, making them valuable targets for chemical diversification. This report advances a previously reported method utilizing a 1:1 mixture of BBr3 and BCl3 to cleave unsymmetric dialkyl ethers with high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity. In this new protocol, regenerable triaryl borates are used in place of BCl3, offering a more sustainable approach. Importantly, all boron&#8208;containing byproducts from the reaction can be converted back into the triaryl borate, enabling full reagent recovery. The speciation of borate/BBr3 mixtures is monitored by 11B&#8208;NMR and compared to the previously studied BCl3/BBr3 system. Additionally, Design of Experiments (DOE) statistical analysis reveals a correlation between borate Lewis acidity and cleavage selectivity. The triaryl borate regenerated in&#8201;situ from aqueous waste performs comparably to freshly prepared material in subsequent reactions. Overall, this system matches or exceeds the performance of the original BBr3/BCl3 method across a broad range of dialkyl ether substrates.

         <title>Fluorescence and Chiroptical Properties of Cyclic Aromatic Triamides with Isolated and Extended Conjugated Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiroptical properties of cyclic aromatic triamides with isolated and extended conjugated systems are studied to develop promising circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. Cyclic aromatic triamides containing 1,4&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)benzene units exhibited dual fluorescence emission, while single and bright fluorescences are observed for those substituted with naphthalene ring. CPL emissions are observed for the compounds bearing three conjugated systems.

This study synthesizes cyclic and acyclic aromatic triamides with conjugated systems to establish molecular design guidelines for obtaining reliable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active materials. For the compounds with the phenylacetylene unit, the acyclic derivative shows a single fluorescence at 381&#8201;nm, whereas the cyclic ones show dual fluorescence. The long&#8208;wavelength emission at 545&#8201;nm is significant for the compound with three &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems measured at 25&#8201;&#176;C. The fluorescence quantum yield and lifetime depend on the number of conjugated systems introduced into the cyclic structure. When the enantiomers of the cyclic compounds is isolated by chiral high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography, all of them shows circular dichroism (CD) activity, but only the compound with the three conjugated systems shows CPL with the anisotropy factor glum&#8201;=&#8201;4.0&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;3. On the other hand, this study also synthesizes two cyclic aromatic triamides with the naphthylacetylene unit and succeeded in optical resolutions. The fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;&#8201;=&#8201;0.80 and 0.34) are improved, and a single sky blue emission is observed. The CD and CPL anisotropy factors are larger than those of the phenyl counterpart, and the CPL shows a BCPL value of about 30&#8201;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1.

         <title>Organolanthanum&#8208;Mediated Coupling of 2&#8208;Bromobiaryls with Ester Electrophiles to Access Valuable Biaryl Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dibenzofulvenes (DBFs) and 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinones (PQs) are synthesized through a coupling reaction of 2&#8208;bromobiaryl compounds with different ester electrophiles by using the unique reactivity of organolanthanum heterocyclic intermediates. This method features a one&#8208;pot procedure, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, readily available substrates, and the ability to provide direct access to both DBFs and PQs.

Dibenzofulvenes (DBFs) and 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinones (PQs) are valuable biaryl derivatives with unique applications in many fields. The development of their synthetic methods is of great importance in organic synthesis. A one&#8208;pot coupling reaction of 2&#8208;bromobiaryls with ester electrophiles is reported, exploiting the exceptional reactivity of organolanthanum heterocyclic intermediates. The reaction enables precise installation of C&#63742;C and C&#63742;O moieties at the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;positions of biaryl scaffolds, providing convenient access to DBFs and PQs with high efficiency and good substrate availability.

         <title>Construction of Medium&#8208;Sized Rings Enabled by a Base&#8208;Mediated Ring Expansion Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Construction of 8&#8211;10 membered rings is achieved via a base&#8208;promoted two carbon ring expansion as a general strategy to formally insert a vinyl group to cyclic ketones.

Medium&#8208;sized ring architectures, widely present in natural products and small molecular drugs, are challenging synthetic targets. Herein, a base&#8208;promoted two&#8208;carbon ring expansion is described as a general strategy to formally insert a vinyl group to cyclic ketones. This method efficiently constructs a wide range of fused&#8208;medium&#8208;sized (8&#8211;10&#8208;membered) ring systems and successfully applies to the late&#8208;stage skeleton editing of complex natural products. Notable features of the procedure include readily available materials, wide substrate scope, and mild conditions.

         <title>Latent&#8208;Functionality&#8208;Based Synthesis of the Furanoside Motif of Hygromycin A</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A latent functionality strategy is employed to construct the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketone motif within the sugar fragment of hygromycin A through the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of furan. Facile epimerization at the C5 position enables access to both the natural congeners of hygromycin A and structurally modified derivatives for potential medicinal applications.

Hygromycin A, a once&#8208;forgotten antibiotic first isolated in 1953, is recently rediscovered as a novel inhibitor of Lyme disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi. Given the increasing resistance of gut microbes to antibiotic treatments, there is an urgent need for new therapies with novel mechanisms of action. The molecular architecture of hygromycin A, characterized by its fragmented structure, makes it an appealing platform for derivatization. In this study, it develops a latent functionality strategy to introduce the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketone motif into the sugar fragment via the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of furan. The facile epimerization at the C5 position enables a rapid access congeners of hygromycin A. Furthermore, glycosylation with phenol derivatives provides a versatile method for establishing the unique stereogenic center of the furanoside in this class of compounds.

     alt="Latent-Functionality-Based Synthesis of the Furanoside Motif of Hygromycin A"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A latent functionality strategy is employed to construct the &#946;-hydroxy ketone motif within the sugar fragment of hygromycin A through the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of furan. Facile epimerization at the C5 position enables access to both the natural congeners of hygromycin A and structurally modified derivatives for potential medicinal applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hygromycin A, a once-forgotten antibiotic first isolated in 1953, is recently rediscovered as a novel inhibitor of Lyme disease caused by &lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt;. Given the increasing resistance of gut microbes to antibiotic treatments, there is an urgent need for new therapies with novel mechanisms of action. The molecular architecture of hygromycin A, characterized by its fragmented structure, makes it an appealing platform for derivatization. In this study, it develops a latent functionality strategy to introduce the &#946;-hydroxy ketone motif into the sugar fragment via the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of furan. The facile epimerization at the C5 position enables a rapid access congeners of hygromycin A. Furthermore, glycosylation with phenol derivatives provides a versatile method for establishing the unique stereogenic center of the furanoside in this class of compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The one&#8208;pot direct N&#8208;acylation of N&#63743;H sulsoximines with carboxylic acids is described. The method can be performed under mild low&#8208;temperature reaction conditions and exhibits a wide substrate scope (&gt;&#8201;60 examples). The present method is operationally simple, scalable, and practical; thus, it can find wide applications in both academic and industrial laboratories.

This report describes a general and simple method for the one&#8208;pot direct N&#8208;acylation of sulfoximines with carboxylic acids using the previously developed 4&#8208;(N,N&#8208;dimethylamino)pyridine N&#8208;oxide (DMAPO)/di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl dicarbonate (Boc2O) system. The method can be performed under mild low&#8208;temperature reaction conditions and has a wide substrate scope. The present method is operationally simple, scalable, and practical; thus, it can find wide applications in both academic and industrial laboratories.

         <title>Synthesis and Physicochemical Characterization of 6&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Spiro[3.3]Heptane Building Blocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decagram&#8208;scale synthesis of functionalized CF3&#8208;containing spiro[3.3]heptane building blocks (including alcohols, amines, boronates, carboxylic acid, and amino acids) starting from the commercially available materials is developed. Using model derivatives, the effects of the CF3 group on physicochemical and conformational properties of the title scaffold are elucidated and compared to those of nonfluorinated, monofluorinated, and gem&#8208;difluorinated counterparts.

A practical synthesis of 6&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)spiro[3.3]heptane&#8208;derived building blocks is developed. Starting from a commercially available cyclobutanone derivative, a key building block&#8212;1,1&#8208;bis(bromomethyl)&#8208;3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)cyclobutane&#8212;is prepared on a 0.5&#8201;kg scale in a single run. Further construction of the spiro[3.3]heptane core is achieved via double alkylation of TosMIC or malonate diester on up to 120&#8201;g scale. Simple functional group transformation provides access to a wide range of mono&#8208; and bifunctional spiro[3.3]heptane&#8208;derived building blocks, including alcohols, amines, boronate esters, carboxylic acids, and amino acids on a gram to multigram scale. Physicochemical properties (i.e., acidity pKa and lipophilicity LogP) are experimentally determined and compared to those for non&#8208;, mono&#8208;, and gem&#8208;difluorinated counterparts, as well as cyclohexane and cycloheptane derivatives. The spatial structure of the obtained compounds is evaluated by X&#8208;ray diffraction studies and characterized by exit vector plot analysis.

         <title>Sustainable Synthesis of Biogenic CuO Nanoparticles from Agrowaste for One&#8208;Pot C&#63743;N Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CuONPs exhibiting excellent catalytic activity are developed following a green and sustainable approach, transforming agrowaste material into wealth. The reusable nanostructure effectively catalyzed the C&#63743;N bond&#8208;forming reactions, facilitating the aza&#8208;Michael addition and the synthesis of quinoxaline derivatives offering excellent yields, wide substrate scope, and hassle&#8208;free route.

A simple, green, and cost&#8208;effective method is reported for the synthesis of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuONPs) using waste cotton shell (WCS) ash extract, which serves as a natural base (pH 12), replacing conventional inorganic bases. The green&#8208;synthesized CuONPs exhibit excellent catalytic activity in heterogenous catalysis facilitating C&#63743;N bond formation, a key strategy for accessing various bioactive nitrogen heterocycles. TEM analysis reveals spherical morphology of the CuO nanostructure with an average particle size of 15.5&#8201;nm. The catalyst efficiently promotes the synthesis of quinoxaline derivatives via cyclization of terminal alkynes and o&#8208;phenylenediamine, offering broad substrate scope (17 quinoxaline derivatives), good yields, and recyclability. This methodology is also applicable to aliphatic terminal alkynes. Additionally, CuONPs also catalyzed the aza&#8208;Michael addition reactions of amines with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated compounds at room temperature, affording excellent yields. The protocol tolerates a wide range of amines, including acyclic, cyclic (up to seven&#8208;membered rings), primary, secondary, and heterocyclic amines. Synthesis of 14 aza&#8208;Michael addition products is reported. Furthermore, the CuO nanostructures exhibit high stability and reusability for up to five cycles with minimal loss of activity.

         <title>[3]Radialene Fluorophores with pH&#8208;Switchable Emission and Stable Absorption Maxima</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of the first push&#8211;pull quino [3]radialene fluorophore are reported, integrating a bis(dicyanomethylene)&#8208;[3]radialene acceptor with a benzimidazole donor. It exhibits minimal solvatochromism, and vibronic coupling of the [3]radialene motif dominates the emission properties. Upon protonation, the fluorescence quantum yield rises from 22% to 71%, with a significant redshift.

The first push&#8211;pull quino [3]radialene fluorescent dye is reported. Herein, the novel bis(dicyanomethylene)&#8208;[3]radialene electron acceptor is connected to a benzimidazole donor. With protonation, a substantial redshift of fluorescence wavelength is observed, while the absorption maximum remains stable. This process is accompanied with an increased fluorescence quantum yield to about 70%. Further, the findings are explained by a combined experimental and theoretical approach, and it is found that vibronic coupling plays a crucial role. This study highlights the yet unexplored potential of [3]radialene&#8208;based motifs for the design of environment&#8208;responsive fluorophores.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions in Aqueous Micellar Media</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous micellar media have emerged as sustainable alternatives to organic solvents for small&#8208;molecule synthesis. This Review discusses the evolution of surfactants for synthesis, their application to cross&#8208;coupling reactions, the benefits for reactivity and sustainability, and the remaining challenges in this rapidly growing field.

Thanks to their ability to efficiently and reliably construct carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds, cross&#8208;coupling reactions remain at the forefront of chemical research in both academic and industrial settings. However, the growing emphasis on sustainability has exposed the shortcomings of cross&#8208;coupling chemistry in several areas, including the preponderance toward toxic polar aprotic solvents, high loadings of precious metal catalysts, and production of large quantities of waste. In recent years, micellar reaction media, formed by dissolution of surfactant molecules in water, have emerged as a sustainable alternative to organic solvents, allowing for use of water as the bulk medium while circumventing the usual solubility issues associated with its use. This Review introduces the fundamentals of surfactants for synthesis and summarizes recent advances in cross&#8208;coupling chemistry in micellar media, with a focus on improving both sustainability and reaction performance using micellar technologies.

This Review introduces the fundamentals of surfactants for synthesis and summarizes recent advances in cross-coupling chemistry in micellar media, with a focus on improving both sustainability and reaction performance using micellar technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning Glycosyl Donor Reactivity via Nitroarene Protecting Groups: A Semiarmed Strategy for Selective Glycosylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular strategy reports to tune glycosyl donor reactivity using nitroarene protecting groups. These groups suppress donor reactivity and can be chemically converted into activating groups, enabling a switchable system. This approach broadens the armed&#8211;disarmed glycosylation strategy and allows for efficient, selective oligosaccharide synthesis using precisely controlled donor reactivity.

Herein, a modular strategy for tuning the reactivity of glycosyl donors using nitroarene (NA) protecting groups such as 4&#8208;nitrobenzyl, 4&#8208;nitrobenzoyl, and 4&#8208;nitrophenyl. The electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of the nitro group markedly reduces donor reactivity, enabling selective activation. Notably, these NA groups can be readily transform into electron&#8208;donating pivaloylaminoarene (PA) and methoxycarbonylaminoarene (MCA) groups via nitro reduction followed by acylation or carbamation. This chemical conversion significantly enhances donor reactivity, offering a switchable reactivity platform. Relative reactivity values (RRVs), determined through competitive glycosylation, establish the reactivity trend: NA &lt; arene &lt; PA &lt; MCA. Applying this strategy, an efficient synthesis of a series of disaccharides is achieved, demonstrating its utility in extending the conventional armed&#8211;disarmed approach in glycosylation chemistry.

         <title>Photocatalytic Cyclopropanation of Allenoates with 1,3,4&#8208;Oxadiazolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spirocyclic compounds are key scaffolds in many drugs and other bioactive molecules. While cyclopropanation of allenes is relatively straightforward, synthesis of spirocyclic compounds from these substrates is scarce. We report a photocatalytic, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free cyclopropanation of allenoates with oxadiazolines as carbene precursors . Thioxanthone, serving as an energy transfer catalyst, enables mild reaction conditions and short reaction times.

Spirocyclic compounds are valuable scaffolds in medicinal chemistry and are important components of numerous drugs and other bioactive molecules. Although the cyclopropanation of allenes using typical methods is relatively straightforward, only limited approaches for the synthesis of spirocyclic compounds from allenoates have been reported. Herein, a photocatalytic, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free cyclopropanation of these substrates using oxadiazolines as a source of nucleophilic carbenes is described. The application of thioxanthone as an energy transfer catalyst under violet light irradiation enables the formation of alkylidenecyclopropanes in synthetically useful yields.

         <title>Adding &#8220;Energy&#8221; to Chalcogenophene Chemistry: Electrosynthesis of 2,3,5&#8208;Trisubstituted Selenyl&#8208;Chalcogenophenes and Their Interaction with DNA</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrosynthetic method is developed for synthesizing selenyl&#8208;chalcogenophenes via intramolecular cyclization of (Z)&#8208;chalcogenenynes under mild conditions and without external oxidants. Density functional theory calculations and cyclic voltammetry support the experimental results and help propose plausible mechanistic pathways.

Herein, an efficient and more environmentally benign electrosynthetic approach is reported for the intramolecular chalcogeno cyclization of (Z)&#8208;chalcogenoenynes, resulting in seleno&#8208;chalcogenophene derivatives. The reaction proceeds in an undivided cell in constant current and equipped with platinum electrodes by using 5&#8201;mL of acetonitrile as a solvent, 0.2&#8201;mmol of the (Z)&#8208;chalcogenoenyne, 2 equiv. of diorganoyl diselenide and 0.2 equiv. of electrolyte, 18 overall compounds are synthesized with yields between 52% and 97%. Control experiments and density functional theory studies are also conducted to propose plausible mechanistic pathways. Furthermore, selected compounds are screened via spectrophotometric titration to assess their potential interactions with DNA, with results indicating that both groove and intercalation interactions occure depending on the structure and concentration of the seleno&#8208;chalcogenophene compound. This electrochemical procedure presents itself as a viable and cost&#8208;effective alternative for the synthesis of chalcogenophenes, as it doesn't require external oxidants, operates under mild reaction conditions, and affords its products in good to excellent yields.

         <title>Exhaustive Hydrodechlorination of Trichloroacetamides under Electrochemical Conditions at Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogenation of trichloroacetamides to afford structurally diverse acetamide derivatives is achieved under environmentally benign, mild electrochemical conditions through an iodide&#8208;mediated crucial halogen&#8208;bonding interaction. The reaction mechanism is fully established by control experiments and by in&#8201;situ cyclic voltammetry.

A simple yet efficient electrochemical method is developed for accessing acetamide derivatives from allylic trichloroacetamides derived from the Overman reaction, even though the transformation is synthetically challenging under reductive conditions. The proposed mechanistic pathway of the reaction is fully supported by control experiments and electrochemical studies. Other attractive features, such as inexpensive electrode material and electrolytes, minimal chemical waste, broad substrate scope, consistent yield, operational simplicity, and scalability, make this method appealing.

         <title>Photoinduced Copper Catalyzed C(sp2)&#63743;P Bond Formation by Coupling of Diphenylphosphine with Aryl Iodides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced Ullmann&#8208;type C&#63743;P bond&#8208;forming reaction is accomplished at room temperature with no additional ligand. This method features broad substrate scope, scalability, and product transformation.

A photoinduced copper&#8208;catalyzed coupling of diphenylphosphine with aryl halides is reported. This efficient C(sp2)&#63743;P bond formation is realized by blue LED irradiation of a copper(I) catalyst at room temperature with no additional ligand. A variety of sterically demanding and functionalized substrates are applied under mild reaction conditions to provide the corresponding triarylphosphines in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Two Metals, One Goal: Unlocking Reactivity with Heterobimetallic Systems for Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review involves heterobimetallic catalytic systems that provides access to various organic transformations which are obscure with conventional monometallic systems. It throws light on diverse organic reactions such as alkylation, alkenylation, arylation, annulation, cross&#8208;coupling, and oxidative and decarboxylative coupling presented in conherent with their mechanism and catalytic cycle.

The design of heterobimetallic catalysis is redefining the frontiers in organic synthesis by harnessing the combined power of two distinct metals. It maneuvers a powerful platform in advancing organic transformations through leveraging cooperative synergetic effect of bimetals. In this review, this study unveils heterobimetallic systems that unlock challenging bond activations and novel reaction pathways inaccessible to traditional monometallic systems. It highlights key examples across diverse reaction classes of organic transformation paving way for alkylation, alkenylation, arylation, annulation, cross&#8208;coupling, and oxidative and decarboxylative coupling reactions for the synthesis of pharmaceutically and industrially relevant molecules. The review consolidates on the current updates on the reactions, mechanism, catalytic cycle, and their synthetic transformations. Heterobimetallic catalysts deliver amplified reactivity, expanded substrate diversity, and sharpened selectivity profiles. The bimetallic catalytic system orchestrates multielectron redox&#8208;processes, dual&#8208;site activation, and high turnover numbers. The review concludes with a brief outlook on the future scope, offering a blueprint for next&#8208;generation catalytic platforms that push the boundaries of molecular construction.

         <title>Sustainable Synthesis of Isoxazoles and Isoxazolines Directly from Aldehydes via One&#8208;Pot Metal&#8208;Free Approach Using a Reusable Ionic Liquid [C8DABCO][OH] at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a one&#8208;pot and a multistep approach for the regioselective formation of 3,5&#8208;disubstituted isoxazoles, isoxazolines, and bis&#8208;isoxazoles at room temperature. The metal&#8208;free method enhances product yield, allowing lower catalyst loading, reduced reaction time, and broad substrate tolerance . Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and reusability of the ionic&#8208;liquid underscore its sustainable advantages, reinforcing the efficiency and eco&#8208;friendliness of the protocol.

Isoxazole and isoxazoline derivatives demonstrate versatile therapeutic properties, captivating widespread global attention. Despite the potential benefits of these scaffolds, hurdles such as reliance on cytotoxic and expensive metal catalysts, low productivity, and limited substrate scope impede their effective synthesis. In this work, a 1,4&#8208;Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, based ionic liquid has been developed for the sustainable and eco&#8208;friendly synthesis of isoxazole and isoxazoline derivatives under metal and solvent&#8208;free conditions from chloroaldoximes. The room temperature mediated protocol framed the desired 3,5&#8208;disubstituted and 3,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted compounds, tolerating an array of functionalized and substituted chloroaldoximes, alkynes, and olefins. Moreover, this basic catalytic system even formulates the generation of bis&#8208;isoxazole derivatives and fabricates a one&#8208;pot telescopic strategy for forming the 3,5&#8208;isomer directly from aldehydes. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction done on three of the synthesized compounds confirms the formation of the 3,5&#8208;disubstituted isoxazole and bis&#8208;isoxazole derivatives. In addition, formation of some interesting, unusual products other than the desired isoxazole derivatives provides a new insight into this cycloaddition reaction. The reusability of the catalytic system for up to four consecutive runs and the successful outcome of the gram&#8208;scale reactions illustrate the synthetic efficiency of the protocol.

         <title>Multicomponent Synthesis of Fluorine&#8208;Containing Bioactive Compounds and Drugs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicomponent reactions are robust synthetic tools to assamble complex polyheterocycles and other interesting molecular architectures with potential application in medicinal chemistry, including their fluorine&#8208;containing analogues. Fluorine atoms placed strategically into bioactive molecules often enhance essential pharmacokinetic parameters like bioavailability, lipophilicity and metabolic resistance. Indeed, various marketed drugs contain fluorine atoms in their structures.

It is well known that fluorine atoms placed strategically into bioactive molecules often enhance essential pharmacokinetic parameters like bioavailability, lipophilicity, and metabolic resistance. In the same way, a relatively broad spectrum of marketed drugs contains one or more fluorine atoms in their structures, usually in the form of fluorine&#8208;, difluoromethyl&#8208;, trifluoromethyl&#8208;, or perfluoroalkyl aromatic moieties, being essential parts of their corresponding pharmacophores. Besides, multicomponent reactions (MCR) are highly convergent one&#8208;pot processes in which three or more smartly substituted/functionalized reagents are combined simultaneously, sequentially or consecutively, in the same reactor to assemble complex products (including polyheterocycles) containing most or all atoms from the reagents. Thus, the scope of the present review is to discuss selected MCR&#8208;based works since 2009 for the synthesis of bioactive compounds and drugs that contain at least one fluorine atom in their structures, as well as relevant results from in silico, in&#8201;vitro, and/or in&#8201;vivo studies against a variety of important target biomolecules, highlighting the role of fluorine&#8208;containing moieties.

         <title>Synthesis of Diverse &#946;,&#946;&#8208;Diaryl &#946;&#8208;Siloxy Diamines and Application as Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#946;,&#946;&#8208;Diaryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;siloxy diamines are developed as diverse diamine organocatalysts. The synthetic methodology enables structural diversification through Grignard reactions, as well as subsequent silylation and amination. These diamines catalyzed enantioselective fluorination of &#946;&#8208;diketones in water with improved enantioselectivity (up to 53% ee) compared to conventional catalysts.

&#946;,&#946;&#8208;Diaryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;siloxy diamines are developed as a tunable scaffold for structurally diverse diamine&#8208;based organocatalysts. Synthesis is initiated with the reaction of an oxazolidine methyl ester from L&#8208;serine with various Grignard reagents, introducing a wide range of diaryl substituents at the &#946;&#8208;position. By adjusting the reaction sequence of the silylation and amination steps, the developed synthetic approach enables the incorporation of diverse aryl, silyl, and amine groups, including cyclic, acyclic tertiary, and secondary amines, into 1,2&#8208;diamines. The resulting diamines are evaluated as catalysts in the enantioselective fluorination of &#946;&#8208;diketones in water using N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide. Although the yield is similar to that of the conventional catalyst C1, the enantioselectivity is improved, reaching up to 53% ee.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of 10&#8208;Aryl&#8208;11H&#8208;indeno[2,1&#8208;a]azulenes and Azuleno[2,1&#8208;a]indenones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cycloaddition strategy for the synthesis of 10&#8208;aryl&#8208;11H&#8208;indeno[2,1&#8208;a]azulenes, as well as their derivatives, is presented. The work highlights improve reactivity using enamines from 1&#8208;indanone and pyrrolidine, followed by electrophilic chlorination and oxidation. Structural, optical, and electrochemical investigations elucidate unique properties, offering promising applications in organic electronic and photonic devices.

An efficient synthesis of 10&#8208;aryl&#8208;11H&#8208;indeno[2,1&#8208;a]azulenes has achieved via [8&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition between 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;cyclohepta[b]furan&#8208;2&#8208;ones with an enamine is generated from 1&#8208;indanone and pyrrolidine in good yields. Oxidation of 10&#8208;aryl&#8208;11H&#8208;indeno[2,1&#8208;a]azulenes with 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;p&#8208;benzoquinone in aqueous acetone shows complete decomposition, whereas chlorinated derivatives undergoes the oxidation to afford the corresponding azuleno[2,1&#8208;a]indenones in moderate to good yields. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals that the 11H&#8208;indeno[2,1&#8208;a]azulene and azuleno[2,1&#8208;a]indenone cores are remarkably planar, while the appended aryl groups adopt a nearly orthogonal orientation owing to steric hindrance, thereby limiting conjugative interactions. Ultraviolet&#8208;visible and fluorescence spectroscopic investigations, supported by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations, indicated that the optical transitions are predominantly localized on the azulene unit and are subtly modulated by the electronic nature of the aryl substituents. In addition, electrochemical studies also demonstrate systematic variations in redox potentials according to the electronic characteristics of the aryl groups.

Oxidation of 10-aryl-11&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-indeno[2,1-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]azulenes with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-benzoquinone in aqueous acetone shows complete decomposition, whereas chlorinated derivatives undergoes the oxidation to afford the corresponding azuleno[2,1-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]indenones in moderate to good yields. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that the 11&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-indeno[2,1-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]azulene and azuleno[2,1-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]indenone cores are remarkably planar, while the appended aryl groups adopt a nearly orthogonal orientation owing to steric hindrance, thereby limiting conjugative interactions. Ultraviolet-visible and fluorescence spectroscopic investigations, supported by time-dependent density functional theory calculations, indicated that the optical transitions are predominantly localized on the azulene unit and are subtly modulated by the electronic nature of the aryl substituents. In addition, electrochemical studies also demonstrate systematic variations in redox potentials according to the electronic characteristics of the aryl groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multigram Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation of Functionalized Terminal Alkynes with B2Pin2</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Application of cheap and accessible reactants for copper&#8208;mediated borylation of functionalized terminal alkynes is described. Based on the thorough assessment of different ligands/additives for various types of substrates, a simple decision tree for the optimal reaction condition choice is proposed. Using the developed methodology, a series of synthetically valuable alkenyl boronates is prepared on 10&#8211;300&#8201;g scale in single run.

A comprehensive study of the commercially available ligands/additives in the formal copper&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration reaction of functionalized terminal alkynes is described. Based on the common reaction system (CuCl&#8211;B2Pin2), a set of common and inexpensive ligands or additives&#8212;namely, rac&#8208;BINAP, PPh3, [(t&#8208;Bu)3PH]BF4, and LiCl&#8212;is tested for its effects on the borylation regioselectivity and overall reaction efficiency. The results observed demonstrate correlation between the substrate nature (propargylic, homopropargylic, or higher homolog) and the ligand, which can be used for the preferential preparation of linear or branched isomer of the target alkenyl boronic species. It is found that LiCl and (t&#8208;Bu)3P can be used for preparation of &#946;&#8208;substituted alkenyl boronates, whereas &#945;&#8208;substituted isomers are preferentially obtained in the presence of triarylphopsphine ligands. The scope of the transformations covers derivatives of protected (homo)propargylic alcohols and amines and tolerated free alcohol, ether, silyl ether, ketal, ester, and alkene moieties. The practical utility of the discussed methodologies is proven by the multigram preparation of target building blocks (10&#8230;100&#8201;g for over 20 boronates, up to 300&#8201;g&#8212;for a few selected representatives).

         <title>Copper Coils as Efficient and Inexpensive Reactors for the Synthesis of Tetrazoles in Flow Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;coil reactors are used for the synthesis of tetrazoles starting from benzonitriles in continuous flow. The reaction is carried out at high temperatures and residence times, in the presence of sodium azide, making the flow chemistry approach safer than the batch alternatives. Several tetrazoles have been prepared, including a key precursor of sartan drugs.

Sartans are an important family of drugs used to treat hypertension. A common characteristic of most of them is a biphenyl moiety with a tetrazole ring in the ortho position of the phenyl&#8211;phenyl bond. This tetrazole is typically synthesized from the respective nitriles through a [3&#8201;+&#8201;2] azide&#8208;nitrile cycloaddition. However, the use of large amounts of azides at high temperatures for extended periods of time is inherently concerning, as serious accidents can occur if safety protocols are not thoroughly developed and implemented. The implementation of these procedures in continuous flow would therefore be beneficial from the safety perspective. In this article, a method is presented for the preparation of tetrazoles from the respective nitriles employing a copper coil as reactor and catalyst. The reaction parameters have been studied and optimized to maximize conversion. A variety of benzonitriles with different ring substituents have been transformed in moderate to good yields and copper leaching has been analyzed, showing that the copper leached is enough to catalyze this reaction. More interestingly, the method has been applied to obtain the tetrazole ring present in a key intermediate used in sartan manufacturing, a highly sterically hindered compound.

         <title>Substrate Divergent 4&#960;/6&#960; Electrocyclization of CF3&#8208;Quinolone Heterodendralenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A substrate&#8208;dependent 4&#960;/6&#960; electrocyclization of in&#8201;situ generated CF3&#8208;heterodendralenes from 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;trifluoroacetyl quinolones is described. Phenyl substitution favors 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization to give CF3&#8208;substituted cyclobuta[c]quinolones bearing a CF3&#8208;containing quaternary center, while vinyl substitution promotes 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization to yield CF3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;phenanthridones.

Herein, a substrate&#8208;divergent 4&#960;/6&#960; electrocyclization of hitherto unknown CF3&#8208;heterodendralenes is disclosed, generated in&#8201;situ from the 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;trifluoroacetyl quinolones. The reaction favors 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization in the presence of a phenyl substituent, producing cyclobuta[c]quinolones featuring a challenging CF3&#8208;all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter. Conversely, vinyl substitution promotes 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization to provide CF3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;phenanthridones.

         <title>Cellulose&#8208;Based Nanosponges Loaded with Palladium as Efficient Heterogeneous Catalysts for the Synthesis of Challenging Derivatives with Pharmaceutical Relevance</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a cellulose&#8208;based heterogeneous palladium catalyst (CNS&#8208;Pd) for the efficient and selective Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant heterocyclic derivatives, including scaffolds derived from unstable boronic molecules. The study emphasizes the use of mild conditions, high yields, and reduced palladium leaching, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional homogeneous systems in complex molecule synthesis.

Developing efficient catalytic systems is crucial for synthesizing complex heterocyclic compounds used in pharmaceuticals. However, key motifs, like pyridine and furan derivatives, pose challenges due to regioselectivity and sensitivity to harsh conditions. Conventional homogeneous palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, while effective, suffer from catalyst recovery issues, palladium contamination, and environmental concerns. To overcome these limitations, this study explores cellulose&#8208;based nanosponges as sustainable palladium supports for heterogeneous catalysis, enhancing stability and green chemistry integration. These nanostructured materials, synthesized from cellulose, provide a high&#8208;surface&#8208;area scaffold that enhances uniform palladium dispersion, with a 22% w/w overall loading measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, and prevents metal leaching, integrating green chemistry principles and a safe&#8208;and&#8208;sustainable&#8208;by&#8208;design approach. In this work, the optimization of Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura couplings using CNS&#8208;Pd under mild conditions, showcasing the efficiency and selectivity of this heterogeneous catalyst in the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant heterocyclic derivatives, is presented. Notably, high reaction yields (65%&#8211;99%) even with unstable boronic derivatives are achieved, which are typically synthesized using homogeneous catalysts, often with poor yields, selectivity and purity of the final products. The obtained results underscore the potential of biopolymer&#8208;based catalysts to drive innovation in sustainable pharmaceutical synthesis, effectively bridging the gap between heterogeneous catalysis and pharmaceutical chemistry.

         <title>Efficient Hydrosilylation Reaction of Olefins Catalyzed by a Dinuclear Ruthenium Complex</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under mild reaction conditions, the dinuclear ruthenium catalyst is used to achieve an anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrosilylation reaction of olefins. Notably, the reaction is extremely selective and no alkenylsilanes, olefin reduction products, or isomerization products are detected in this reaction.

Dinuclear metal synergistic catalysis is presented as a strategy for the hydrosilylation of olefins. Both aliphatic and aromatic olefins smoothly undergo anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrosilylation under mild reaction conditions to produce the corresponding organosilicon products in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields (42&#8211;96%) with high selectivity. The formation of alkenylsilanes, olefin reduction products, and isomerization products is not observed. Synthetically valuable functional groups such as chloro atom, methoxycarbonyl, and ester are tolerated well under the current reaction conditions. Control experiments and mechanistic studies suggest a synergistic catalytic mechanism involving bimetallic cooperation.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Alkynylthiolation of Tertiary &#945;&#8208;Carbonyl Bromides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free alkynylthiolation of tertiary &#945;&#8208;carbonyl bromides with 1,2,3&#8208;thiadiazoles. Those reactions involve the in&#8208;situ generation of alkynylthiolate anions from 1,2,3&#8208;thiadiazoles in the presence of a base and then their halogenophilic nucleophilic substitution (SN2X) reactions. The exceptionally mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance highlight the utility of this method to prepare privileged motifs from readily available 1,2,3&#8208;thiadiazoles and tertiary &#945;&#8208;carbonyl bromides feedstocks. Gram&#8208;scale reaction and diverse synthetic transformations convincingly demonstrate the synthetic potential of this method.</dc:description>

         <title>New Approaches in Catalytic Reactions Using Triphos: A Classical Privileged Ligand |</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past decades multiple catalytic transformations have been feasible due to the application of triphos as ligand. Its particular fac coordination mode to a transition metal center provides a suitable flexibility enabling variation on the coordination mode resulting in metal stabilization. Most of the reported catalytic reactions have been dominated by the use of the ruthenium&#8208;triphos system, either by application of well&#8208;defined complexes or the in situ formed complex. However, in the last years the emergence of cobalt complexes with comparable or even superior catalytic performance than ruthenium have been reported. In this review we have focused on the use of triphos in selected reactions such as N&#8208;alkylation, formic acid dehydrogenation and bond cleavage.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Bioorthogonal Mycolic Acids: Chemoselective Reduction of &#946;&#8208;Ketoesters Containing an Alkyne Using the Noyori Catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric reduction of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters using the Noyori catalyst is a highly effective synthetic methodology, offering excellent stereocontrol for the preparation of enantiopure b&#8208;hydroxyesters from prochiral substrates in high yields. This reaction has been used in the total synthesis of mycolic acids, which are &#945;&#8208;alkyl, &#946;&#8208;hydroxy fatty acids forming the main part of the mycobacterial cell outer membrane. Recently, the metabolism of mycobacteria has been explored using the chemical reporter strategy with bioorthogonal analogues or precursors of mycolic acids. Introducing a bioorthogonal alkyne into these compounds is a challenging task and particularly valuable for subsequent probe attachment via click chemistry. This work presents approaches for the synthesis of several alkyne&#8208;containing mycolic acids featuring the native structure of natural mycolic acids. The chemoselectivity of the enantioselective reduction of several b&#8208;ketoesters using the Noyori catalyst in the presence of a protected terminal alkyne group was investigated. Conditions have been optimized to ensure that the alkyne remains intact during the reduction process. This study provides valuable tools for further mycomembrane studies using the CuAAC reaction and the optimized conditions extends the possibilities in the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters with an alkyne function.</dc:description>

         <title>Point&#8208;to&#8208;axis optical activity induction in extended, sterically congested chromophoric systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The readily available, modular and electronic circular dichroism (ECD)&#8208;silent derivatives of terephthalaldehyde (the probes) have exhibited an induced optical activity upon condensation with chiral primary amines. The central unit of the probe serves as an amine binder by forming imine bonds and is flanked by two extended chromophoric units (&#8220;the wings&#8221;). Modification of the wings by diphenylamine or carbazole units affects the sterical and spectroscopic properties of the probes. An increase in sterical congestion within the probe core resulted in a change in the mechanism of optical activity induction. In the more congested systems, the point&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transmission from the chiral amine (the inducer) to the chromophoric system led to the adaptation of helical conformation by &#8220;the wings&#8221; and the appearance of non&#8208;zero Cotton effects (CEs) in the low&#8208;energy part of the ECD spectrum. However, the sterically congested probes were sensitive to the chirality of the inducers but relatively indifferent to the differences in their structure. Thus, the chirality of the inducers triggers conformational change towards the thermodynamically preferred conformational diastereoisomer due to the probe's &#8212;1 &#8208; +1 operation scheme.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated Silyl Esters and Silyl Phosphonates Over Cyclopropanation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated silyl esters are an important class of compounds in organic, inorganic and pharmaceutical chemistry, known for their versatility and unique reactivity. The conjugated system in these compounds enables for Michael addition reactions, making them useful intermediates in the synthesis of complex organic/inorganic molecules, including pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and natural products. Having realized the importance of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated silyl esters, we have devised a strategy to synthesize various functionalized allyl and vinyl silanes using diazo compounds and respective silanes. Herein we have demonstrated that the allyl and vinyl silanes can react with diazo compounds in a chemoselective manner offering a versatile method for constructing C&#8208;C bond formation over the cyclopropanation reaction in the presence of 1 mol% of [Cp*RuCl2]n as a catalyst under mild conditions. Direct C&#8208;H bond functionalization of allyl and vinyl silanes with alpha diazo esters and phosphonate diazo showcasing the adaptability of silicon&#8208;based chemistry in modern organic synthesis. The plausible mechanism of the reaction has been realized with the help of DFT calculations. All the synthesized &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated siliyl esters were isolated and characterized by using sophisticated analytical and spectroscopic techniques.</dc:description>
