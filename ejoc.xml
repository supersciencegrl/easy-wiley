         <title>Environmental Control of Regio&#8208;/Stereoselectivity Across Mechanistically Similar Transformations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lewis Acid (LA) catalysis offers a unifying strategy to tune nucleophilic additions. By modulating electrophile activation, LAs shift regioselectivity in epoxide openings and diastereoselectivity in carbonyl additions by 43&#8211;76%. Strong LAs (e.g., AlCl3, SnCl4) amplify subtle bond or face differences, enabling predictable, high&#8208;impact control across mechanistically related transformations.

The control of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity in organic transformations remains a foundational challenge in synthetic chemistry. While chemoselectivity can often be influenced by careful selection of reagents or protective groups, controlling regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity is far more nuanced, often requiring highly specific reaction conditions. In this work, a unified approach for controlling both regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity across mechanistically related transformations is explored, specifically focusing on epoxide openings and carbonyl additions. It is demonstrated that the same environmental factors, here the nature of the Lewis acid (LA), can be leveraged to influence divergent outcomes in these two reaction types by amplifying inherent differences between reaction sites/faces, leading to highly selective transformations. The systematic evaluation of over 30 Lewis acids revealed a dichotomy between &#8220;labile&#8221; and &#8220;strong&#8221; activation modes, where strong LAs, such as AlCl3 and SnCl4, drive the highest levels of regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity for both transformations. Further, there exists nuanced differences between the degree of influence of some LA within these mechanistically related transformations. These findings suggest that environmental factors can be broadly applied across different mechanistic classes to achieve selectivity, offering a versatile strategy for reaction optimization.

         <title>Synthesis and Photophysical Analysis of Amphiphilic Azobenzene Surfactants for Photomechanical Actuation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Subtle electronic modifications of tailored amphiphilic azobenzene derivatives exhibit distinct cis&#8208;state half&#8208;lives despite similar activation barriers. The structural functionalization enables the molecules to be soluble in water and organic solvents, making them photomechanical surfactants with different behavior in oil&#8208;in&#8208;water versus water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions.

Photoswitchable amphiphiles are promising candidates for investigating light&#8208;responsive mechanical behavior in soft and biological systems, with potential applications in dynamic materials and adaptive interfaces. Azobenzene is the most studied photoactuator, but research typically focuses on its standard backbone, limiting control over its photophysical and kinetic properties. Modifying its conjugated core offers new opportunities for tuning its behavior. Here, the synthesis and characterization of water&#8208;soluble azobenzene derivatives featuring a hexaethylene glycol (OCH2CH2)6 unit terminated with a sodium sulfate (O&#63743;SO3Na) group, alongside subtle electronic modifications to the conjugated backbone, are reported. Their steady&#8208;state photophysical properties and reversible photoisomerization kinetics in aqueous environments under real&#8208;time observation are demonstrated. Despite similar activation parameters for the thermal cis&#8211;trans isomerization in some derivatives, their half&#8208;lives vary significantly, underscoring the overlooked role of the transmission coefficient in isomerization kinetics. Finally, these photo&#8208;responsive amphiphiles are showcased as dynamic surfactants in oil&#8208;in&#8208;water and water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions, visualizing their behavior through operando microscopy. These findings underscore their potential for tunable emulsions and adaptive soft matter applications.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross Coupling of N&#8208;Alkenyl Heterocycles and Aryl Sulfonium Salts: Expedient Access to N&#8208;Benzyl Heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of a site&#8208;selective C&#63743;H dibenzothiophenation with nickel&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) cross coupling reaction is developed, offering an orthogonal protocol to traditional SN2 and C&#63743;N coupling methods to bioactive N&#8208;benzylic heterocycles. The mild conditions and good functional&#8208;group compatibility permit the rapid construction of molecular complexity and late&#8208;stage functionalization of arenes.

A nickel&#8208;catalyzed system is developed that enables the coupling between aryldibenzothiophenium salts and N&#8208;alkenyl heterocycles. Traditionally, medicinally relevant N&#8208;benzylic heterocycles are constructed via harsh substitution conditions between the N&#8208;H heterocycle and a benzyl electrophile in the presence of strong bases. The C&#63743;C cross coupling strategy presents attractive potential for the synthesis of these important scaffolds, e.g., carboetomidate. Herein, it is documented that the combination of a site&#8208;selective C&#63743;H dibenzothiophenation with a nickel&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) cross coupling grants access to a diverse range of synthetically useful N&#8208;benzylic heterocycles, i.e., alkylated arenes. In particular, the mild conditions and good functional group compatibility permit the rapid assembly of molecular complexity and late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive compounds, such as clofibrate, fenofibrate, and fenbufen, thus providing an orthogonal protocol to existing SN2 and C&#63743;N coupling approaches.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Four&#8208;Component Radical Carbonylation Reaction for the Construction of Benzofuranamide Derivativesitle</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of fluoroalkylated and carbonylated benzofuran derivatives are efficiently prepared by a multicomponent free&#8208;radical strategy involving the migration of a double bond and the insertion of a carbonyl group. The domino process avoids the preparation of precursors in the multistep reaction by accurately controlling the addition order between components and uses cheap and readily available raw materials.

A novel palladium&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component radical tandem cyclization&#8208;carbonylation of 1,6&#8208;enynes with aniline, carbon monoxide, and ethyl difluoroiodoacetate is reported. This approach facilitates a multicomponent reaction involving tandem 1,2&#8208;double bond migration, thereby allowing the efficient synthesis of alkylamide&#8208;substituted benzofuranamide derivatives. The proposed strategy demonstrates a broad substrate scope, high efficiency in bond migratory&#8208;rearrangement, and controllable selectivity in the order of component addition.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Acyl Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling from Carboxylic Acids In&#8201;Situ Activated by HATU: An Efficient Way to Ketones Laid by Nitrogen Coordination</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed acyl Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reaction between carboxylic acids and organoboronic acids is developed by using HATU as the in&#8201;situ activator, which provided a mild and versatile method for ketones synthesis. Experimental and density functional theory&#8208;computation studies disclosed the detailed role of the nitrogen&#8208;atom and the likely pathways.

A palladium&#8208;catalyzed acyl Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling between carboxylic acids and organoboronic acids has been developed, employing hexafluorophosphate azabenzotriazole tetramethyl uronium as an in situ activator. Using Pd2(dba)3/PCy3 as the catalyst and K2CO3 as the base, the reaction accommodates a broad range of both aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids. Controlled experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the pyridine nitrogen plays a critical role in the catalytic cycle.

&lt;p&gt;A palladium-catalyzed acyl Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling between carboxylic acids and organoboronic acids has been developed, employing hexafluorophosphate azabenzotriazole tetramethyl uronium as an in situ activator. Using Pd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(dba)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/PCy&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as the catalyst and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as the base, the reaction accommodates a broad range of both aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids. Controlled experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the pyridine nitrogen plays a critical role in the catalytic cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Influence of Levulinoyl Protecting Groups on Glycosylation Stereoselectivity and Glycosyl Cation Structure</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of levulinoyl protecting groups on the glycosylation stereoselectivity and glycosyl cation structure is studied for galactose and mannose building blocks.

The stereoselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;cis glycosidic bonds is historically challenging, and a common synthetic approach is based on the participation of remote protecting ester groups. Common intermediates of glycosylation reactions are glycosyl cations, whose structures are difficult to characterize. Here, the glycosylation reactions and structure of the glycosyl cations of galactose and mannose are investigated when protected with levulinic acid (Lev) at C4 and/or C6, respectively. The glycosyl cations can be assigned to rearranged structures as a consequence of ring opening, as well as dioxolenium ions that suggest remote participation. Some evidence for the long&#8208;range interaction of the Lev keto group is found as previously proposed, which could explain unusual solution&#8208;phase stereoselectivities observed.

         <title>Fast Nucleophilic Approach to Exhaustively Substituted Porphyrin Derivatives at the &#8220;Eastern Half&#8221;</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;step procedure including the nitration of simple porphyrinates (Zn2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+ complexes) and very attractive vicarious nucleophilic substitution of hydrogen reaction gives porphyrin derivatives with unique structures, exhaustively &#946;&#8208;substituted in the so&#8208;called &#8220;Eastern half.&#8221; These types of hydrophilic or amphiphilic target products are sought in anticancer photodynamic therapy. It seems they are practically unavailable by any other alternative methods.

meso&#8208;Tetraarylporphyrin chelates (of Zn2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+) are easily available from parent porphyrins. Their reactions with nitric acid (yellow fuming HNO3, d&#8201;=&#8201;1.52, diluted to 25%&#8211;50%), under optimized conditions in CHCl3 at room temperature, can be carried out selectively, thus giving mainly &#946;,&#946;&#8208;dinitro&#8208;substituted moieties (usually two or three isomers of the above complexes). These intermediates (obtained in overall yields of up to 73%), upon the reaction with carbanions bearing a leaving group X at the reactive center, afford the target products, the ones of vicarious nucleophilic substitution (VNS) of hydrogen. This approach allows the synthesis of porphyrin derivatives exhaustively &#946;&#8208;substituted in the so&#8208;called &#8220;Eastern half&#8221;, starting from a simple meso&#8208;tetraarylporphyrins. These types of products are sought in anticancer photodynamic therapy (PDT). Thus, the above two&#8208;step procedure including very attractive VNS reaction gives hydrophilic or amphiphilic moieties that seem to be potential PDT agents with unique structures, being practically unavailable by any other alternative methods.

         <title>1,3&#8208;Diazetidin&#8208;2&#8208;Ones: Synthetic Approaches and Therapeutic Promise within the Aza&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Lactam Family</title>

         <dc:description>
This review explores the synthesis, reactivity, and therapeutic potential of 1,3&#8208;diazetidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones&#8212;an underexplored class of aza&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams. Emphasis is placed on synthetic challenges, emerging methodologies, and their promise as &#946;&#8208;lactamase&#8208;resistant scaffolds in medicinal chemistry.

1,3&#8208;diazetidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones, overlooked members of the aza&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactam family, are structurally distinct four&#8208;membered nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles with strong potential in medicinal chemistry, particularly as &#946;&#8208;lactamase inhibitors and antibiotic analogues. This review provides a comprehensive overview of their synthesis, structural diversity, and biological significance. The most established synthetic method is the [2&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition between C&#63742;N nucleophiles and isocyanates, though this approach is highly substrate dependent and frequently leads to side products or cycloreversion. Alternative strategies&#8212;including photochemical and organometallic methodologies&#8212;have been explored but remain limited in scope. As a result, access to 1,3&#8208;diazetidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones is significantly constrained, impeding wider investigation and application. In&#8201;silico studies suggest favorable stability and reactivity profiles and indicate these compounds could circumvent &#946;&#8208;lactam resistance through hydrolysis&#8208;resistant enzyme intermediates. Several derivatives have demonstrated promising antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, and anticancer activities. Nevertheless, further synthetic innovation is essential to fully realize the therapeutic potential of this underexplored class of heterocycles.

         <title>Nucleophilic Substitution of Alkyl Halides with Secondary Phosphine Oxides under Solvent&#8208;Free Conditions for the Synthesis of Tertiary Phosphine Oxides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 34, September 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the green and efficient synthesis of tertiary phosphine oxides, possible self&#8208;induced side reactions can be avoided by replacing trivalent phosphorus esters with secondary phosphine oxides. The resulting transformation has clear advantages over conventional Michaelis&#8211;Arbuzov reactions.

The development of a metal&#8208;free Michaelis&#8211;Arbuzov reaction for green and efficient construction of C&#63743;P(V) compounds represents a significant advancement in organophosphorus synthesis. Herein, a nucleophilic substitution strategy between alkyl halides and secondary phosphine oxides under solvent&#8208; and metal&#8208;free conditions is reported, using sodium iodide as the catalytic promoter. This method provides a facile operation for the synthesis of diverse tertiary phosphine oxides with significant advantages. Firstly, the reaction exhibits broad substrate compatibility, covering a range of aliphatic halides and phosphorus nucleophiles. Secondly, it can be scaled up to the gram level without sacrificing efficiency, and the reaction pathway clearly established through rational studies. Particularly noteworthy is the complete elimination of transition metal catalysts and organic solvents, which aligns with the principles of green chemistry.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Carboxylation of Aryl Boronates in Supercritical CO2</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 34, September 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal&#8208;free carboxylation of aryl boronates catalyzed by ZnO is achieved by using supercritical CO2. Cage&#8208;shaped cyclic trialkoxyboronates, which are both nucleophilic and soluble in supercritical CO2, undergo the carboxylation efficiently in supercritical CO2 at high pressure and temperature to give corresponding aromatic carboxylic acids with good functional group tolerance.

Carboxylation using stable and abundant CO2 as a carbon source is an attractive option in synthetic organic chemistry if the use of highly reactive organometals or toxic and expensive transition metals can be avoided. Herein a transition metal&#8208;free direct carboxylation of aryl trialkoxyboronates in supercritical CO2 (scCO2), promoted by a catalytic amount of ZnO, is reported. The use of cage&#8208;shaped trialkoxyboronates, which are both nucleophilic and soluble in scCO2, is the key to this reaction. density functional theory calculations indicate that the high pressure and high temperature of scCO2 with the ZnO catalyst compensate for the high activation energy of direct carboxylation of the boronates.

Site&#8208;Selective C&#63743;H Amination of Lupane&#8208;Type Triterpenoids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 34, September 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H amination of betulin 28&#8208;O&#8208;sulfamate ester enables access to oxathiazinane&#8208;fused triterpenoids with high C16&#8208;selectivity. Sequential transformations yield 16&#8208;amino&#8208; and 16&#8208;azido derivatives, offering versatile building blocks for medicinal chemistry. Introduction of a C16&#8208;substituent directs further C&#63743;H amination to C22.

A synthetic protocol for rhodium&#8208;catalyzed, site&#8208;selective C&#63743;H amination of the betulin scaffold has been developed. Under catalytic conditions, betulin&#8208;derived 28&#8208;O&#8208;sulfamate ester undergoes intramolecular C&#63743;H amination to afford 1,2,3&#8208;oxathiazinane&#8208;2,2&#8208;dione&#8208;fused lupane triterpenoids with a C16/C22 selectivity ratio 9:1. Introduction of a C16&#8208;substituent enables a second sequential C&#63743;H amination, which occurs with C22 selectivity. Betulin&#8208;derived oxathiazinanes can be cleaved and the ring&#8208;opened products provide straightforward access to 16&#8208;amino&#8208; and 16&#8208;azido&#8208;betulin, 16&#8208;amino&#8208;betulinic, and 16&#8208;amino&#8208;betulonic acids. Betulin analogs with selectively introduced amine and azide functionalities are versatile building blocks for further medicinal chemistry applications in semisynthetic triterpenoid series.

5&#8208;halo&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;fused tricyclic compounds, prepared from 1&#8208;(&#969;&#8208;azidoalkyl)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,2&#8208;dihalovinyl)arenes, undergo Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling with 2&#8208;nitrobenzeneboronic acids, followed by triphenylphosphine treatment, yielding diverse fluorescent pentacyclic compounds incorporating triazole rings.

By heating 1&#8208;(&#969;&#8208;azidoalkyl)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,2&#8208;dihalovinyl)arenes in DMF, intramolecular Huisgen cycloaddition between the azido group and the 1,1&#8208;dihalovinyl moiety proceeds smoothly to afford 5&#8208;halo&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;fused tricyclic benzocondensed compounds. Leveraging the remaining halogen groups, the carbon chain extension via the Mizoroki&#8211;Heck or Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reactions, followed by an intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction, furnish polycyclic systems that incorporate fused triazole rings. Furthermore, the transformation of the halogen groups into the 2&#8208;nitrobenzene derivatives via Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling, followed by a Cadogan reaction using triphenylphosphine, provides a series of fluorescent pentacyclic compounds.

         <title>Nucleophilic Trifluoromethoxylation of Benzyl Bromides via Carbonyl Diimidazole</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 34, September 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Previous reports on accessing trifluoromethoxylated compounds have been limited by utilizing toxic/volatile/expensive precursors that required multistep preparation of trifluoromethylating reagents. Herein, this study proposes an efficient nucleophilic trifluoromethoxylation protocol via commercially available, inexpensive, bench&#8208;stable and solid reagent, carbonyl diimidazole and AgF as the fluoride source through a novel mechanism not involving AgOCF3 as an intermediate.

An operationally simple nucleophilic trifluoromethoxylation protocol via an inexpensive, commercially available and bench stable reagent, carbonyl diimidazole and AgF is presented. Mechanistic studies are performed to reveal that this method does not proceed through the conventional trifluoromethoxide anion pathway that generates toxic difluorophosgene as an intermediate.

         <dc:description>
A novel concave mirror&#8208;based photoreactor boosts reaction rates across diverse visible&#8208;light transformations. This modular, cost&#8208;effective design enhances illumination of the reaction mixture, accelerates photocatalytic transformations and supports small&#8208;scale experiments, offering a practical solution for researchers in the field.

A novel photoreactor design for enhanced reaction efficiency and reproducibility is disclosed. The performance of the new setup with a spherical mirror&#8208;like architecture is evaluated through six versatile visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven transformations reported in the literature. Inexpensive, modular, and adaptable, photoreactor enables an increase in optical power and provides significant acceleration of photocatalytic reactions in all cases. Parallel experiments as well as small&#8208;scale chemistry are also examined.

Inexpensive, modular, and adaptable, photoreactor enables an increase in optical power and provides significant acceleration of photocatalytic reactions in all cases. Parallel experiments as well as small-scale chemistry are also examined.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>5&#8208;Bromo&#8208;8&#8208;Nitro&#8208;1&#8208;Naphthoic Acid as Protective Group for Alcohols Under Mitsunobu Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 34, September 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protection of alcohols is carried out using the readily available 5&#8208;bromo&#8208;8&#8208;nitro&#8208;1&#8208;naphthoic acid (NNapOH). Under Mitsunobu conditions, primary and secondary alcohols are converted into the corresponding esters, which are subsequently deprotected under mild reduction conditions.

The use of the readily available 5&#8208;bromo&#8208;8&#8208;nitro&#8208;1&#8208;naphthoic acid (NNapOH) as a protective group for primary and secondary alcohols is described. Protection is carried out under Mitsunobu conditions, and the protective group can be readily removed under mild reducing conditions, due to the significant steric strain between C&#8208;1 and C&#8208;8 naphthalene substituents. The reaction has been tested with different hydroxy substrates, including monoalcohols, 1,2&#8208;diols, and the anticancer ribonucleoside 5&#8208;fluorouridine. Interestingly, in the case of linear 1,2&#8208;diols, protection occurs preferentially at the secondary alcohol. In addition, orthogonal protection is obtained with N&#8208;Boc hydroxy amino acid derivatives.

         <title>Photocatalytic Decarboxylation of Carboxylic Acids by Iron Catalysis for the Construction of C(sp3)&#63743;O Bonds under Visible Light</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 34, September 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;catalyzed, visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven decarboxylative strategy has been developed for C(sp3)&#63743;O bond formation. This method features broad substrate scope, mild conditions amenable to gram&#8208;scale reactions, and potential for late&#8208;stage functionalization.

The facile construction of C(sp3)&#63743;O bonds holds significant importance in organic synthesis. Herein, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven iron&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylation of alkyl carboxylic acids is reported, enabling C(sp3)&#63743;O bond formation through the trapping of generated alkyl radicals with TEMPO. This method is characterized by its low cost, broad substrate compatibility, and operational simplicity. Not only does it provides an efficient approach to C(sp3)&#63743;O bond construction, but also it demonstrates potential applications in synthetic chemistry through subsequent modifications of TEMPO derivatives.

         <title>Mild Photocatalytic Hydrodecarboxylation of Fatty Acid Derivatives using Xanthene Dyes for Biomass Valorization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 34, September 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elegant xanthene&#8208;based method for metal&#8208; and hydrogen&#8208;free photocatalytic deoxygenation of lipidic biomass is reported, featuring DIPEA as a dual&#8208;function sacrificial reductant and hydrogen donor, enabling efficient one&#8208;pot Cn&#8211;1 hydrocarbon synthesis under mild, open&#8208;air conditions.

A complementary and practical method for the synthesis of renewable Cn&#8211;1 hydrocarbons with yields of up to 80%, via mild photocatalytic hydrodecarboxylation of fatty acids activated as N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters, is reported herein. Inexpensive, easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, and environmentally friendly xanthene dyes (Eosin Y or Fluorescein&#8208;Na2) act as photocatalysts, with DIPEA serving as both sacrificial reductant and hydrogen donor. The reactions proceed under visible light, at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, in open&#8208;air conditions. Additionally, a one&#8208;pot application is demonstrated, involving in&#8201;situ ester formation and scale&#8208;up using a real mixture of fatty acids derived from vegetable oil, for photocatalytic biomass valorization.

         <title>Fluorescent &#946;&#8208;Sheet&#8208;Based Peptide Hydrogels with Aggregation&#8208;Enhanced Emission Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 34, September 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent hydrogels from 1,8&#8208;naphtalimide&#8208;based peptides are designed and characterized; the materials are injectable and present enhanced emission upon &#946;&#8208;sheet formation.

Novel fluorescent peptide hydrogels are reported by combining 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide&#8208;derived amino acids with a previously developed peptide&#8208;based controlled drug release matrix. Aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission is achieved by inserting the fluorescent naphthalimide moieties in a peptide sequence with self&#8208;assembling properties. The formation of &#946;&#8208;sheets directs the orientation of the luminescent side chains, leading to the avoidance of aggregation&#8208;caused quenching. The relation between the &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;underpinned fiber formation and the emission characteristics is further elucidated by spectroscopic and microscopic techniques, including correlative fluorescence and atomic force microscopy imaging. Owing to the incorporation of the naphthalimide moiety, the gelation concentration is lowered and the gel strength improved. The resulting hydrogels does not contain any organic solvent (in contrast to ample literature examples), present thixotropic behavior, and the fluorescent properties are sensitive to environmental conditions such as temperature and medium. These features make the soft biomaterials interesting for applications such as biosensing, real&#8208;time bioimaging, and 3D printing. The high tunability of the peptide sequence composition and configuration, as well as the chemical structure of the 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide moiety, allows for modulating the material toward desired properties.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of Secondary Alcohols Using Connon Type Catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 34, September 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The kinetic resolution of alcohols mediated by Connon&#8208;type catalysts depends on electronic substituent effects rather than substrate or catalyst size.

Chiral pyridine derivatives following the general design principle proposed by Connon et al. are employed in the Lewis base mediated kinetic resolution of secondary alcohols. Variations in the size of substrates and catalyst substituents are found to impact reaction selectivity in a nonsystematic manner, while best selectivities are found for catalyst variants carrying electron&#8208;acceptor&#8208;substituted side chains. Solvent effects are found to be small for the most active and most selective catalysts studied, but more significant for less selective catalysts. The quantitative assessment of reaction kinetics points to a rather limited contribution of background acylation reactivity, but to a very significant temperature effect on reaction outcome.

This review divulged the palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile couplings of halo or pseudohalides to synthesize biaryls and substituted aryls, eliminating the need for preformed organometallic reagents.

Palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) has emerged as a powerful strategy for selectively forming carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds from two distinct electrophiles. This approach eliminates the need for preformed organometallic reagents by utilizing in&#8201;situ reduction to generate reactive intermediates under mild conditions while enhancing functional group tolerance. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in palladium&#8208;catalyzed XEC transformations, highlighting novel strategies, mechanistic insights, ligand and catalyst design, substrate scope, and synthetic applications. Additionally, current challenges and future directions in this fast&#8208;progressing field, aiming to inspire further innovation in sustainable catalysis are discussed.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 34, September 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article focuses on the advancements in utilizing boron&#8208;based organocatalysts, specifically organoboranes and boronic acids, in glycosylation reactions. It highlights how these organocatalysts are being used to enhance the efficiency as well as the scope of regio&#8208; and stereoselective glycosylation, a crucial process in the synthesis of complex carbohydrates and glycoconjugates.

The efficient and stereoselective formation of glycosidic bonds remains a long&#8208;standing challenge in carbohydrate chemistry, particularly in the synthesis of complex glycans, while conventional chemical methods often involve metal&#8208;based catalysts and require harsh reaction conditions, which result in reduced chemo&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and sometimes regiocontrol, particularly as chemical complexity in the substrates increases. In recent decades, organocatalysis has been a revolutionary approach, which offers sustainable and selective glycosylation strategies. Among the various organocatalysts explored, organoborons have demonstrated exceptional promise as mild and versatile activators of glycosylation reactions and for controlling the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity. This review highlights the recent advances in the use of boron&#8208;based organocatalysts, specifically organoboranes and boronic acids, in glycosylation reactions. Herein, the focus is placed on their mechanistic roles as Lewis acids, their interactions with hydroxyl&#8208;containing substrates, and their ability to modulate regioselectivity and stereoselectivity. Key contributions of boronic acids and organoboranes in promoting 1,2&#8208;cis and 1,2&#8208;trans glycosidic linkages, activating various classes of glycosyl donors, and enabling regio&#8208; and stereoselective transformations under mild conditions are critically examined. It is divided into two main sections: the first part focuses on the highly Lewis&#8208;acidic borane B(C6F5)3 catalyzed glycosylation, and the second part discusses RB(OH)2&#8208;based glycosylation and its potential for future research.

         <title>Exploring the Chemical Reactivity of Triisopropylsilyl Dialkynylmethanol for the Synthesis of Dialkynylcarbinol&#8208;Related Compounds</title>

The relevance of 1&#8208;(triisopropylsilyl)penta&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;ol as a versatile C5 organic framework is highlighted in both racemic and enantiopure form thanks to a finely optimized lipase&#8208;mediated enzymatic kinetic resolution procedure. This straightforward approach, exploiting the reactivity of the terminal alkyne group, opened the way for the most cytotoxic series to date of bioinspired lipidic alkynylcarbinols.

Prompted by the pharmacological relevance of lipidic alkynylcarbinols, 1&#8208;(triisopropylsilyl)penta&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;ol is exploited as a versatile C5 organic framework. Selective functionalization of this dissymmetrical dialkynylcarbinol precursor is achieved via the creation of either a Csp&#8211;Csp (alkyne), a Csp&#8211;Csp2 (alkene and aryl), or a Csp&#8211;Csp3 (RCHOH) bond. A novel series of racemic HSD17B11&#8208;bioactivated procytotoxic acetylenic lipids is accessed that revealed, amongst the most potent to date, with IC50 down to 27&#8201;nM on osteosarcoma U2OS cells. Click&#8208;type 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions, such as a copper&#8208;catalyzed reaction with a long&#8208;chain alkyl azide (CuAAC) and a base&#8208;promoted reaction with a lipidic nitrile oxide, are first described in a racemic version. Preparation of both enantiomers of 1&#8208;(triisopropylsilyl)penta&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;ol through kinetic enzymatic resolution with CAL&#8208;B immobilized on acrylic resin is carefully optimized. Finally, the use of resolved samples in 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions leads to the enantioenriched cycloadducts without significant epimerization of the carbinol center.

         <title>An Improved Synthesis of Ionizable Lipids D&#8208;Lin&#8208;KC2&#8208;DMA and D&#8208;Lin&#8208;MC3&#8208;DMA</title>

         <dc:description>
A new route to ionizable lipid KC2 through the double alkylation of TosMIC with linoleyl tosylate avoids problematic reactions, is higher yielding, and requires three fewer steps. Lipid MC3 is also more efficiently prepared by the new method.

Considerable interest exists in ionizable lipids (ILs) for the delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics. While not a component of a yet&#8208;approved medication, lipid KC2 is especially competent for the delivery of plasmid DNA, consequently it is in high demand on the part of research laboratories worldwide. Lipid MC3, a component of Onpattro, is a benchmark against which the efficacy of new ILs is evaluated. A new route to KC2 and MC3 through the double alkylation of TosMIC with linoleyl tosylate is described. The new synthesis avoids problematic reactions, proceeds in higher overall yield relative to the literature one, and in the case of KC2, involves three fewer steps.

         <title>Photoinduced Reduction and Deuteration of Aryl Halides with NHC&#8208;Boranes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced radical reduction and deuteration of aryliodides and arylbromides is achieved using NHC&#8208;borane without external initiators or photoredox catalysts. The reaction proceeds via aryl radicals and tolerates a broad range of functional groups, offering a practical and versatile approach for dehalogenation and isotopic labeling.

Herein, an operationally simple photoinduced radical reduction of aryliodides and arylbromides using NHC&#8208;borane as a reductant, without external radical initiator or photoredox catalyst, is reported. Mechanistic investigations indicate the key formation of an aryl radical, which undergoes facile reduction by NHC&#8208;borane. The method demonstrates compatibility with a broad range of functional groups, providing a valuable tool for synthesis and isotopic labeling.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Directed Sulfinylation of Distal C(sp3)&#63743;H Bonds by Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox/copper&#8208;cocatalyzed remote C&#63743;H sulfoxidation reaction is described that proceeds through radical&#8208;mediated 1,5&#8722;hydrogen atom transfer. A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction between N&#8722;alkoxypyridinium salts and sodium arylsulfinates gave a series of hydroxy sulfoxide derivatives. This transformation features redox&#8208;neutral conditions, broad functional group compatibility, and excellent site selectivity.

An efficient photoredox&#8208;catalyzed reaction is reported for site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#63743;H sulfoxidation of N&#8208;alkoxypyridinium salts using sodium arylsulfinates as sulfinyl donors. This transformation involves alkoxy&#8208;radical&#8208;directed 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (1,5&#8722;HAT) followed by C(sp3)&#63743;S bond formation. A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven, copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling strategy enables the synthesis of a series of hydroxyl sulfoxide derivatives. This methodology establishes a novel synthetic platform for rapid construction of sulfoxide&#8208;containing molecular architectures, demonstrating remarkable functional group compatibility and predictable regioselectivity.

A rapid synthesis of azosulfones can be accomplished in a vibrational mechanical mill, giving up to quantitative yields in as little as 30&#8201;min. The tolerance of the method is demonstrates on a broad substrate scope and is successfully used to produce 30 different products. Spectroscopic and computational studies provide insight into the process and its selectivity.

Azosulfones represent a potent and stable surrogate for diazonium salts. Their wide application in C&#8211;H functionalizations catalyzed by transition metals and visible light is well&#8208;known in organic chemistry. Here, a single&#8208;step mechanochemical synthesis of azosulfones is reported, starting from readily available precursors, which has high conversion efficacy &#8722;80%&#8211;99% isolated yields are obtained in most cases. A substrate scope of 30 different compounds is obtained. This method requires no solvent, it is quick and has potential in terms of scalability and tolerance toward a broad range of functional groups, which makes it attractive for synthesis. Spectroscopic and computational studies are performed to explain the observed reactivity patterns.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Induced the Radical Cascade Cyclization of 2&#8208;Isocyanobiaryls via 1,2&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>

Phenanthridines, as important structural moieties of many naturally occurring products, pharmaceuticals, and functionalized polycyclic heteroarenes, have attracted considerable attention among chemists due to their significant potentials in pharmaceutical and material chemistry. Herein, a visible light&#8208;induced radical cascade cyclization of 2&#8208;isocyanobiaryls via 1,2&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer is described to rapidly synthesize phenanthridines under mild conditions. 

Phenanthridines, as important structural moieties of many naturally occurring products, pharmaceuticals, and functionalized polycyclic heteroarenes, have attracted considerable attention among chemists due to their significant potential in pharmaceutical and material chemistry. The hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process provides an important strategy for selective C&#63743;H functionalization. However, net 1,2&#8208;HAT processes have been reported and applied infrequently compared to the popularity of 1,5&#8208;HAT processes. Herein, a visible light&#8208;induced radical cascade cyclization of 2&#8208;isocyanobiaryls via 1,2&#8208;HAT is described to rapidly synthesize phenanthridines under mild conditions. This approach represents an example of radical cascade cyclization of 2&#8208;isocyanobiaryls via infrequent 1,2&#8208;HAT to access the phenanthridine core. This protocol features a 1,2&#8208;HAT, a radical cascade process, broad substrate scope, and good functional group compatibility under mild and oxidant&#8208;free reaction conditions.

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Aminomethyl&#8208;5R&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;Triazoles by Cyclization of Amidrazones: Multigram Approach and Revised Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of 3&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;5R&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoles from acyl hydrazides and methyl phthalimidoacetimidate is proposed. The reaction conditions are optimized to control the cyclization pathway, minimizing the formation of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole by&#8208;products. The intramolecular cyclization mechanism of amidrazones is discussed on the basis of quantum chemical calculations.

A series of 3&#8208;(aminomethyl)&#8208;5R&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoles is synthesized in gram&#8208;scale quantities starting from N&#8208;(cyanomethyl)phthalimide and carboxylic acid hydrazides. The intramolecular cyclization of amidrazones to give 1,2,4&#8208;triazolines is the key step. The main side products are 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazoles formed by a concurrent intramolecular condensation. Their amount depends on the steric and electronic nature of the substituent in the initial carboxylic acid hydrazide. Additionally, aminomethyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole is modified by the introduction of different substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4 of the heterocyclic scaffold. Quantum chemical calculations demonstrate a fine balance of activation energy values for the key stages in the formation of the two isomeric products. In contrast to the previously derived mechanism, the participation of water, not ammonia, is required as a&#8201;factor reducing the activation barriers for both reaction pathways.

         <title>Synthesis of Bis&#8208;Arylated Squaryls via Addition of Organocopper Species onto Squaryl Dichlorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple protocol for the iterative and selective introduction of diverse substituents relayed through organocopper chemistry has been developed, providing access to sophisticated bis&#8208;functionalized squaryl scaffolds. This provides a unified approach to access four&#8208;membered rings possessing useful functional handles.

Squaric chlorides serve as convenient, readily available building blocks in the synthetic path toward unsymmetrically substituted squaryls. The use of in&#8201;situ generated arylcopper reagents enables precise, selective control over stoichiometry and facilitates the creation of a diverse library of sophisticated structures.

         <title>Escape from Flatland: Pericyclic Reactions and Rearrangements of Diazofluorene with Biarylcyclooctynes for the Generation of Helicene&#8208;Like Phenanthro&#8208;Pyrazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flat molecules will remain flat no longer! The journey of two planar molecules&#8212;armed with just a few pericyclic transition states&#8212;into the 3D world of spirocycles and heterohelicenes is reported. Only the thermodynamically stable will survive!

Herein, the voyage of two flat, highly unsaturated systems into the third dimension is reported. Specifically, the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of 9&#8208;diazofluorene with a rapidly growing class of strained dipolarophile&#8212;biarylcyclooctynes&#8212;are investigated. It is found that the initial spirocyclic 3H&#8208;pyrazole cycloadducts are isolable and can be subjected to controllable [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic shifts. These van Alphen&#8211;H&#252;ttel rearrangements generate either the metastable 4H&#8208;pyrazoles&#8212;another spirocyclic fused&#8208;ring system with a highly contorted structure&#8212;or the thermodynamically favored 1H&#8208;pyrazoles. The 1H&#8208;pyrazoles display extended conjugation and can be classified as [5]&#8208;helicenes containing a phenanthro&#8208;pyrazole fused to a dihydro&#8208;cyclooctatetraene. Overall, these studies provide a modular framework to control heteroatom placement, ring size, and ring fusion in the syntheses of carbon&#8208;rich materials.

Specifically, the 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions of 9-diazofluorene with a rapidly growing class of strained dipolarophile&#8212;biarylcyclooctynes&#8212;are investigated. It is found that the initial spirocyclic 3&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-pyrazole cycloadducts are isolable and can be subjected to controllable [1,5]-sigmatropic shifts. These van Alphen&#8211;H&#252;ttel rearrangements generate either the metastable 4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-pyrazoles&#8212;another spirocyclic fused-ring system with a highly contorted structure&#8212;or the thermodynamically favored 1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-pyrazoles. The 1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-pyrazoles display extended conjugation and can be classified as [5]-helicenes containing a phenanthro-pyrazole fused to a dihydro-cyclooctatetraene. Overall, these studies provide a modular framework to control heteroatom placement, ring size, and ring fusion in the syntheses of carbon-rich materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Directed C&#8211;H Heteroarylation of 2&#8208;Pyridones Using Cyclic Iodonium Ylides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Pyridones are pivotal building blocks for the synthesis of bioactive nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C6&#8208;selective C&#8211;H heteroarylation of 2&#8208;pyridones has been developed by employing cyclic iodonium ylides as carbene precursors. The versatility and broad applicability of this method are highlighted by the efficient synthesis of diverse compounds featuring both 2&#8208;pyridone&#8208;pyridine and cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl structural motifs.

2&#8208;Pyridone is a crucial building block in bioactive natural products and serves as a vital intermediate for the synthesis of bioactive nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. Recent advancements in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization have enabled the direct modification of 2&#8208;pyridones, circumventing the need for prefunctionalization. Herein, a Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed, C6&#8208;selective C&#8211;H heteroarylation of 2&#8208;pyridones using cyclic iodonium ylides as carbene precursors is reported. The versatility and broad applicability of this method are demonstrated through the efficient synthesis of diverse compounds featuring both 2&#8208;pyridone&#8208;pyridine and cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl derivatives.

Selective C&#63743;F Bond Activation in 1,1&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes: Synthesis of Functionalized Monofluoroalkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treatment of 2&#8208;aryloxy&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes with Me2AlCl promotes fluoride abstraction, followed by cyclopropane ring opening, to generate &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated oxocarbenium ions. These cations are trapped with nucleophiles such as arenes and silyl enol ethers to provide functionalized 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1&#8208;alkenes. The instability of vinyl cations prevents further fluoride abstraction, resulting in completely selective C&#63743;F bond activation.

Functionalized monofluoroalkenes (3&#8208;arylated and 5&#8208;oxygenated 1&#8208;aryloxy&#8208;2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1&#8208;alkenes) are synthesized via selective activation of the C&#63743;F bonds in 2&#8208;aryloxy&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes that are readily prepared from aryl vinyl ethers. Treatment of these difluorocyclopropanes with Me2AlCl promotes fluoride abstraction followed by cyclopropane ring opening to generate &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated oxocarbenium ions. These cations are subsequently trapped with nucleophiles, such as arenes and silyl enol ethers (Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208; and aldol&#8208;type reactions), to provide functionalized 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1&#8208;alkenes. Because of the instability of vinyl cations, further fluoride abstraction is suppressed, resulting in completely selective C&#63743;F bond activation.

A nickel&#8208;catalyzed carboalkoxylation and borylalkoxylation of the biphenylene C&#63743;C &#963;&#8208;bond has been developed to form the corresponding ring&#8208;opening oxygenative difunctionalization products. The key to success is the use of acetal&#8208;based, electron&#8208;deficient peroxides, which enable the otherwise challenging C&#63743;O cross coupling with nickel catalysts even under photo&#8208;free, thermal reaction conditions.

The key to success is the use of acetal&#8208;based, electron&#8208;deficient peroxides, which enable the otherwise challenging C&#63743;O cross coupling with nickel catalysts even under thermal conditions.

         <title>Exploration of Structure&#8211;Property Relationships by Altering Glycol Backbone Unsaturation (Double/Triple Bonds) in Furan&#8208;Based Polyesters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores how adding unsaturated groups to bio&#8208;based furanic polyesters can change their stiffness and heat resistance. While this offers new possibilities, it also needs careful control during production. It is shown that solution polycondensation works well for making these materials and offers a path toward more flexible, stable, and ecofriendly polymers.

This study highlights both the challenges and opportunities associated with developing bio&#8208;based furanic polyesters. Incorporating unsaturated moieties into glycol chains effectively modulates polymer rigidity and thermal properties, though it requires careful optimization of polymerization conditions. The findings demonstrate the viability of solution polycondensation for synthesizing high&#8208;quality FDCA&#8208;based polyesters with unsaturated glycols and pave the way for further investigations into polymer design strategies that balance flexibility, thermal stability, and environmental sustainability.

         <title>White Light&#8208;Induced Slow Kinetics Generation of Arynes</title>

These aryne photoprecursors participate in [3&#8201;+&#8201;2] and [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloadditions, as well as in metal&#8208;free C&#63743;N couplings, with good functional group tolerance. Their utility is demonstrated in the synthesis of an advanced intermediate for aporphine alkaloids.

Herein, 2&#8208;(3&#8208;acetyl&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;triazen&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzoic acids are synthesized from anthranilic acids, including two new derivatives, without the use of strong bases. These compounds allow the slow and controlled generation of arynes via a white light&#8208;induced process, which participates in [3&#8201;+&#8201;2] and [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition reactions, as well as in a metal&#8208;free C&#63743;N bond formation reaction. This chemistry, which tolerates sulfur&#8208;, boron&#8208;, and silicon&#8208;containing compounds, is successfully performed on a scale of up to 1.5&#8201;mmol. A radical mechanism for the photogeneration of arynes is proposed based on a control reaction using TEMPO. In addition, the application of triazenylbenzoic acids is evaluated through the synthesis of a dehydroaporphine compound, which is an advanced synthetic intermediate for the synthesis of aporphine alkaloids.

In addition, the application of triazenylbenzoic acids is evaluated through the synthesis of a dehydroaporphine compound, which is an advanced synthetic intermediate for the synthesis of aporphine alkaloids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Heterogeneous flow intramolecular dehydrative Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation has been successfully achieved. The reaction is completed by a single pass of a solution of 1&#8208;substituted &#969;&#8208;arylalkan&#8208;1&#8208;ols in HFIP through a cartridge packed with HO&#8208;SAS with a residence time of 40&#8211;80&#8201;s. The efficiency of the present process is demonstrated by the short&#8208;step synthesis of pachypostaudin A.

         <title>Elucidating the Mechanism and Origin of Site Selectivity in the Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#63743;H Functionalization of a Thioamide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The detailed reaction mechanism of the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#63743;H activation/amidation of a thioamide has been extensively investigated using density functional theory methods. The origin of site selectivity in the C(sp3)&#63743;H activation step is elucidated through structural analysis.

In the present study, the mechanism of cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#63743;H activation/amidation reaction of thioamide has been investigated using density functional theory. The computational results indicate that the activation of the primary C(sp3)&#63743;H bond is more energetically favorable than the secondary C(sp3)&#63743;H bond. The formation of a five&#8208;membered cobaltacycle is the key intermediate for the amidation reaction with dioxazolone. Based on the calculations, the amidation reaction of cobaltacycle intermediate proceeds through the sequential stepwise decarboxylation, migratory insertion, and proto&#8208;demetalation processes. The extended transition state&#8208;natural orbitals for chemical valence analysis verify that the primary C(sp3)&#63743;H activation occurs predominantly due to the stronger interfragment interaction.

The complex has been characterized by 1H and13C nuclear magnetic resonance&#160;spectroscopy and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. Additionally, the complex has been structurally characterized. This complex has been used as a homogeneous catalyst for the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones with benzylic alcohols as an alkylating agent in toluene at 120&#8201;&#176;C in the presence of Cs2CO3. The scope of the reaction extends to the synthesis of a fluorescent &#945;&#8208;alkylated product. Mechanistic insights suggest that the water molecule generated in&#8201;situ during the aldol condensation facilitates the reactivation of the catalytic species, thereby sustaining the catalytic cycle.

Visible Light&#8208;Induced Singlet&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Substituted Benzo[c]chromeno[4,3,2&#8208;gh]phenanthridines&#8224;</title>

A visible light&#8208;induced singlet&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated Na2 eosin Y&#8208;catalyzed single&#8208;step synthesis of benzo[c]chromeno[4,3,2&#8208;gh]phenanthridine derivatives is reported that involves a metal&#8208;free oxidative hetero&#8208;crosscoupling reaction followed by an aromatization reaction.

Visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted environmentally benign synthesis of various 9&#8208;alkylbenzo[c]chromeno[4,3,2&#8208;gh]phenanthridine derivatives in the presence of 5&#8201;mol % disodium salt of eosin Y (EY) as photocatalyst is reported from 2&#8208;(7,8,9,10&#8208;tetrahydrobenzo[c]phe&#8208;nanthridin&#8208;6&#8208;yl) phenol derivatives, which were prepared through a three&#8208;component reaction. In the present protocol, EY&#8208;photosensitized singlet oxygen (1O2) promotes intramolecular cyclization through an oxidative hetero&#8208;crosscoupling reaction, followed by aromatization to provide the final product in a single step, which has not been reported earlier. The mechanism of the reaction was established through density functional theory calculation and by trapping of the oxygen radical intermediate A with Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT), which was confirmed through 1H, 13C NMR spectra, and HRMS. This process forms the highly fused hexacyclic heteroaromatics without requiring any metal catalyst or dehydrogenating agent. This intramolecular photocyclization, through the triplet energy transfer process, is a fascinating example of the oxidative coupling reaction via distal sp3&#8208;C&#63743;H.

         <title>Sustainable Electrochemical Access to &#945;&#8208;Thiocyanate Ketones: A Metal&#8208;Free Protocol Utilizing Ammonium Thiocyanate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utilization of ammonium thiocyanate has been developed for the electrosynthesis of &#945;&#8208;thiocyanate ketones under environmental&#8208;friendly conditions, addressing limitations of conventional oxidative methods.

A robust and environmentally benign electrochemical method for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;thiocyanate ketones from aromatic ketones is reported. The protocol utilizes ammonium thiocyanate as both the thiocyanate source and supporting electrolyte in an undivided cell with platinum electrodes and an acetonitrile/water/sulfuric acid solvent system. This metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free transformation proceeds under mild conditions, exhibiting broad substrate scope, excellent functional group compatibility, and amenability to gram&#8208;scale operations. The developed approach offers a sustainable and practical alternative for accessing these valuable thiocyanated carbonyl compounds, addressing limitations of conventional oxidative methods.

         <title>Boron Difluoride Complexes with N,S&#8208;Schiff&#8208;base Ligands: Synthesis, Structure, and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron difluoride complexes with N,S&#8208;Schiff&#8208;base ligands exhibit distorted six&#8208;membered chelate structures due to sulfur coordination, leading to redshifted absorption and emission compared to N,O&#8208;chelate analogs. These results highlight their potential as tunable optical materials.

Boron difluoride complexes incorporating N,S&#8208;Schiff&#8208;base ligands are synthesized, and their structural and photophysical properties are investigated. The complexes are obtained via a one&#8208;pot synthetic route from 2&#8208;mercaptobenzaldehyde, yielding N,S&#8208;donor frameworks that coordinate with boron atoms to form six&#8208;membered chelate rings. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that these complexes adopt distorted coordination structures, attributed to the larger atomic radius of the sulfur atom. This geometric distortion results in redshifted absorption and emission spectra, in comparison to analogous N,O&#8208;Schiff&#8208;base boron difluoride complexes. These findings, supported by theoretical calculations, highlight the potential of N,S&#8208;Schiff&#8208;base boron difluoride complexes as tunable optical materials through both electronic and geometric modulation.

         <title>Basicity and Lipophilicity of gem&#8208;Difluorinated Saturated Bicyclic Amines: Advanced Building Blocks for Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed study of the physicochemical properties of gem&#8208;difluorinated bicyclic amines is reported. pKa and LogP measurements reveal interesting trends affected by the fluorination pattern of the compound and the bicyclic system itself, which are partially rationalized through molecular electrostatic potential surface analysis.

The impact of gem&#8208;difluorination on the physicochemical properties of bicyclic saturated amines with 6&#8211;8 atoms in the largest ring is studied. The fluorination effect on the acidity of protonated species (pKa) aligns with predictions based on the inductive effect of the electron&#8208;deficient substituent. In contrast, lipophilicity (LogP) could either increase or decrease due to gem&#8208;difluorination. The observed effect depends on the number of vicinal C&#63743;H bonds relative to the fluorine atoms, but it is also influenced by their relative spatial orientation and the structure of the bicyclic core itself.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Arylacetyl Thioesters from Benzyl Chlorides and Thioformates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thioester transfer strategy employing thioformates as dual sulfur/carbonyl sources enables efficient thiocarbonylation of benzyl chlorides. This method bypasses toxic CO and malodorous thiols, offering broad substrate scope and mild conditions for diverse thioester synthesis. The protocol enhances practicality in organic and biomolecular applications.

Thioesters are vital synthons in organic synthesis and biological processes, yet their synthesis often&#8201;faces challenges such as the use of toxic CO, malodorous thiophenols, and restricted substrate scope. To address these challenges, this study develops a thioester transfer strategy using thioformates as both sulfur and carbonyl sources, which enables the thiocarbonylation of benzyl chlorides. This approach facilitates the successful coupling of thioformates with benzyl chloride, providing efficient access to diverse thioesters. This advancement broadens the substrate scope and enhances the practicality of thioester synthesis in organic chemistry.

         <dc:description>
Electrochemical tandem self&#8208;coupling/selenylation of acetonitrile delivers (Z)&#8208;tetrasubstituted alkenes with amino, cyano, and seleno groups. This potassium iodide&#8208;mediated, metal/oxidant&#8208;free protocol features simple operation, high chemoselectivity, and excellent stereoselectivity.

Herein, an electrochemical tandem reaction that integrates acetonitrile self&#8208;coupling with selenylation to construct densely functionalized tetrasubstituted alkenes bearing amino, cyano, and seleno groups from readily available acetonitrile and diselenides is reported. Employing potassium iodide as a redox mediator under mild, metal&#8208;free, and oxidant&#8208;free conditions, this sustainable strategy leverages the synergistic effect of electrochemical oxidation and iodine catalysis to achieve inert C(sp3)&#63743;H bond activation of acetonitrile. The transformation exhibits good stereoselectivity along with substrate scope across diverse aryl and alkyl selenides.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Reduction of &#946;&#8208;Nitroacrylates via Hydrogen Atom Transfer Promoted by Tetrabutylammonium Decatungstate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrabutylammonium decatungstate is hereby applied as efficient photocatalyst for the hydrogenation or deuteration of &#946;&#8208;nitroacrylates via hydrogen atom transfer. The protocol affords the desired products in good yields, with short reaction time, and demonstates a good functional group compatibility.

A photocatalyzed reduction of the C&#63742;C double bond in &#946;&#8208;nitroacrylates under flow conditions is developed. The reaction takes place upon irradiation at 390&#8201;nm in the presence of tetrabutylammonium decatungstate and requires &#947;&#8208;terpinene as a hydrogen source. Products are obtained in good yields, and various functional groups are tolerated, such as unconjugated double bonds, benzyl groups and carbonyls, thus demonstrating a substantial chemoselectivity.

Sonochemical multicomponent synthesis of 2&#8208;(2&#180;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine&#160; analogs with an intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonded eight&#8208;membered ring exhibiting an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer fluorescent process.

Multicomponent reactions are excellent tools to generate complex structures with broad chemical diversity and fluorescent properties. The sonochemical multicomponent one&#8208;pot synthesis of novel organic luminescent heterocycles, such as 2&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine (2&#8208;HPIP) analogs, is described. The Groebke&#8211;Blackburn&#8211;Bienaym&#233; reaction (GBBR) affords good to excellent yields (75&#8211;95%). Notably, the compound 4b forms an intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonded eight&#8208;membered ring (8&#8208;MR) in the crystalline state and is luminescent in this phase; in solution, this compound exhibits dual band emission with a very large Stokes shift of 18&#8201;382&#8201;cm&#8722;1 attributed to an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process. Time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) and additional calculations are performed to evaluate the HOMO&#8211;LUMO distributions and theoretical absorption spectra, being in agreement with the experimental data. Additionally, the TD&#8208;DFT calculations in solution (chloroform) show the ESIPT process and 8&#8208;MR formation become thermodynamically favorable in 4b. This work represents the first synthesis of prompts feasibility ESIPT heterocyclic luminescent materials via an eight&#8208;membered ring (8&#8208;MR) with an N&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#63743;O connection.

         <title>Efficient Route for Construction of Fluorinated Isoxazolines through Base&#8208;Mediated Fluorinated Amino Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A base&#8208;mediated, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free reaction between ethyl 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;((diphenylmethylene)amino)&#8208;3,3&#8208;difluoropropanoate and nitrones facilitates a rapid, one&#8208;step synthesis of fluorinated isoxazolidines. This streamlined protocol proceeds under mild conditions to construct the valuable heterocyclic scaffold efficiently, with broad substrate scope and high practicality.

Isoxazolines have attracted widespread attention for the development of anticancer, antiviral, and anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs due to their unique electronic properties and conformational rigidity. However, the application of fluorinated isoxazolines in the development of innovative drugs has been constrained by the lack of appropriate synthetic methods for introducing fluorine atoms into the isoxazole ring skeleton. In this article, a rapid synthesis of fluoroisoxazolines is reported based on a pre&#8208;functionalization strategy: ethyl 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;((diphenylmethylene)amino)&#8208;3,3&#8208;difluoropropionate is reacted with imine oxides under alkaline conditions to efficiently construct the fluoroisoxazolidine skeleton in one step without the need for transition metal catalysts. This simple operation is performed under mild green reaction conditions, offering a concise and efficient pathway for the synthesis of fluoroisoxazololidine compounds.

A (Ru)&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;C&#63743;H sulphonamidation of benzo[b][1,4]oxazin&#8208;2&#8208;ones using sulfonyl azides enables access to diverse sulphonamides in excellent yields. The method features broad substrate scope, high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity, and functional group tolerance, offering a streamlined route to functionalized heterocycles under mild conditions.

This study presents a novel ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed method for the regioselective ortho&#8208;sulphonamidation of benzo[b][1,4]oxazin&#8208;2&#8208;ones. Utilizing sulfonyl azides, which release benign nitrogen gas as a byproduct, this approach achieves high yields and excellent ortho&#8208;selectivity in C&#63743;H functionalization. The protocol exhibits a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and operational simplicity. Optimization studies and control experiments support a plausible reaction mechanism involving a ruthenium&#8208;metallacycle intermediate. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis demonstrates the practicality and potential of the method to access biologically relevant molecules, significantly expanding C&#63743;H functionalization in heterocyclic chemistry.

         <title>Intramolecular Azide&#8211;Alkene Cycloaddition&#8212;The Logothetis Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As originally reported by Logothetis, alkenyl azides cyclize smoothly on warming, leading, depending on substitution, to cyclic imines or bicyclic aziridines. These intermediates can then be carried on to other products. This review summarizes the many ways the Logothetis reaction has been employed in target&#8208;directed synthesis.

The assembly of cyclic amines is fundamental to medicinal chemistry. While intramolecular azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition is widely practiced, intramolecular azide&#8211;alkene cycloaddition is much less used, even though it has been known since 1965.

     alt="Intramolecular Azide&#8211;Alkene Cycloaddition&#8212;The Logothetis Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As originally reported by Logothetis, alkenyl azides cyclize smoothly on warming, leading, depending on substitution, to cyclic imines or bicyclic aziridines. These intermediates can then be carried on to other products. This review summarizes the many ways the Logothetis reaction has been employed in target-directed synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assembly of cyclic amines is fundamental to medicinal chemistry. While intramolecular azide&lt;b&gt;&#8211;&lt;/b&gt;alkyne cycloaddition is widely practiced, intramolecular azide&lt;b&gt;&#8211;&lt;/b&gt;alkene cycloaddition is much less used, even though it has been known since 1965. This review is an overview of the applications of intramolecular azide&lt;b&gt;&#8211;&lt;/b&gt;alkene cycloaddition in target-directed synthesis since that time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Ortho&#8208;Deuteration of Electron&#8208;Deficient N&#8208;Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herin, the metal&#8208;free, selective deuteration of electron&#8208;deficient N&#8208;heteroaromatics is reported using O&#8208;carbamate and carboxamide ortho&#8208;directing groups (DGs), lithium 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide as the base, and D2O as a green source of D+. The substrate scope includes 10 small molecule N&#8208;heteroaromatic compounds and two pharmaceutically relevant synthetic precursors for which the DGs can be manipulated to form chemical libraries of compounds.

Selectively deuterated electron&#8208;deficient N&#8208;containing heteroaromatic systems can enable modulation of metabolism with enhanced therapeutic efficacy in pharmaceuticals and improved properties and stability of functional materials, e.g., imaging dyes, light emitters, and catalysts. Current synthetic approaches to selectively deuterate N&#8208;heteroaromatic rings largely rely on transition metal (TM) catalysts, prone to inducing over&#8208;deuteration while posing several environmental and sustainability concerns and requiring onerous purification to remove metal traces. In this work, an alternative TM&#8208;free approach is reported based on directed ortho metalation, which employs lithium 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide (LiTMP) such as the base and D2O as a green and accessible electrophilic source of deuterium (D). Since the O&#8208;carbamate and carboxamide directing groups (DGs) can be transformed into other functional groups or cross&#8208;coupled with aromatic or aliphatic moieties, this enables a modular approach to synthesize a series of drug analogs, as exemplified by the synthesis of a precursor to momelotinib&#8208;d1&#160;and the key building block pyrimidine&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic&#8208;5&#8208;d1 acid.

         <title>Regiocontrolled Cleavage of Dialkyl Ethers Using Regenerative Borates as a Sustainable Alternative to Boron Trichloride</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of triaryl borates for highly selective ether cleavage is described. The borate is regenerable from the aqueous extract of a previous ether cleavage reaction without repurification, making use of low toxicity boron and phenolic waste. Such strategies for C&#63743;O cleavage are expected to be broadly applicable to synthetic manipulations where management of waste is critical.

Ethers are ubiquitous functional groups in natural products, surfactants, and materials, making them valuable targets for chemical diversification. This report advances a previously reported method utilizing a 1:1 mixture of BBr3 and BCl3 to cleave unsymmetric dialkyl ethers with high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity. In this new protocol, regenerable triaryl borates are used in place of BCl3, offering a more sustainable approach. Importantly, all boron&#8208;containing byproducts from the reaction can be converted back into the triaryl borate, enabling full reagent recovery. The speciation of borate/BBr3 mixtures is monitored by 11B&#8208;NMR and compared to the previously studied BCl3/BBr3 system. Additionally, Design of Experiments (DOE) statistical analysis reveals a correlation between borate Lewis acidity and cleavage selectivity. The triaryl borate regenerated in&#8201;situ from aqueous waste performs comparably to freshly prepared material in subsequent reactions. Overall, this system matches or exceeds the performance of the original BBr3/BCl3 method across a broad range of dialkyl ether substrates.

         <title>Fluorescence and Chiroptical Properties of Cyclic Aromatic Triamides with Isolated and Extended Conjugated Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiroptical properties of cyclic aromatic triamides with isolated and extended conjugated systems are studied to develop promising circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. Cyclic aromatic triamides containing 1,4&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)benzene units exhibited dual fluorescence emission, while single and bright fluorescences are observed for those substituted with naphthalene ring. CPL emissions are observed for the compounds bearing three conjugated systems.

This study synthesizes cyclic and acyclic aromatic triamides with conjugated systems to establish molecular design guidelines for obtaining reliable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active materials. For the compounds with the phenylacetylene unit, the acyclic derivative shows a single fluorescence at 381&#8201;nm, whereas the cyclic ones show dual fluorescence. The long&#8208;wavelength emission at 545&#8201;nm is significant for the compound with three &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems measured at 25&#8201;&#176;C. The fluorescence quantum yield and lifetime depend on the number of conjugated systems introduced into the cyclic structure. When the enantiomers of the cyclic compounds is isolated by chiral high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography, all of them shows circular dichroism (CD) activity, but only the compound with the three conjugated systems shows CPL with the anisotropy factor glum&#8201;=&#8201;4.0&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;3. On the other hand, this study also synthesizes two cyclic aromatic triamides with the naphthylacetylene unit and succeeded in optical resolutions. The fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;&#8201;=&#8201;0.80 and 0.34) are improved, and a single sky blue emission is observed. The CD and CPL anisotropy factors are larger than those of the phenyl counterpart, and the CPL shows a BCPL value of about 30&#8201;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1.

         <title>Organolanthanum&#8208;Mediated Coupling of 2&#8208;Bromobiaryls with Ester Electrophiles to Access Valuable Biaryl Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dibenzofulvenes (DBFs) and 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinones (PQs) are synthesized through a coupling reaction of 2&#8208;bromobiaryl compounds with different ester electrophiles by using the unique reactivity of organolanthanum heterocyclic intermediates. This method features a one&#8208;pot procedure, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, readily available substrates, and the ability to provide direct access to both DBFs and PQs.

Dibenzofulvenes (DBFs) and 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinones (PQs) are valuable biaryl derivatives with unique applications in many fields. The development of their synthetic methods is of great importance in organic synthesis. A one&#8208;pot coupling reaction of 2&#8208;bromobiaryls with ester electrophiles is reported, exploiting the exceptional reactivity of organolanthanum heterocyclic intermediates. The reaction enables precise installation of C&#63742;C and C&#63742;O moieties at the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;positions of biaryl scaffolds, providing convenient access to DBFs and PQs with high efficiency and good substrate availability.

&lt;p&gt;Dibenzofulvenes (DBFs) and 9,10-phenanthrenequinones (PQs) are synthesized through a coupling reaction of 2-bromobiaryl compounds with different ester electrophiles by using the unique reactivity of organolanthanum heterocyclic intermediates. This method features a one-pot procedure, transition-metal-free conditions, readily available substrates, and the ability to provide direct access to both DBFs and PQs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dibenzofulvenes (DBFs) and 9,10-phenanthrenequinones (PQs) are valuable biaryl derivatives with unique applications in many fields. The development of their synthetic methods is of great importance in organic synthesis. A one-pot coupling reaction of 2-bromobiaryls with ester electrophiles is reported, exploiting the exceptional reactivity of organolanthanum heterocyclic intermediates. The reaction enables precise installation of C&#63742;C and C&#63742;O moieties at the 2,2&#8242;-positions of biaryl scaffolds, providing convenient access to DBFs and PQs with high efficiency and good substrate availability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of Medium&#8208;Sized Rings Enabled by a Base&#8208;Mediated Ring Expansion Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Construction of 8&#8211;10 membered rings is achieved via a base&#8208;promoted two carbon ring expansion as a general strategy to formally insert a vinyl group to cyclic ketones.

Medium&#8208;sized ring architectures, widely present in natural products and small molecular drugs, are challenging synthetic targets. Herein, a base&#8208;promoted two&#8208;carbon ring expansion is described as a general strategy to formally insert a vinyl group to cyclic ketones. This method efficiently constructs a wide range of fused&#8208;medium&#8208;sized (8&#8211;10&#8208;membered) ring systems and successfully applies to the late&#8208;stage skeleton editing of complex natural products. Notable features of the procedure include readily available materials, wide substrate scope, and mild conditions.

         <title>Latent&#8208;Functionality&#8208;Based Synthesis of the Furanoside Motif of Hygromycin A</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A latent functionality strategy is employed to construct the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketone motif within the sugar fragment of hygromycin A through the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of furan. Facile epimerization at the C5 position enables access to both the natural congeners of hygromycin A and structurally modified derivatives for potential medicinal applications.

Hygromycin A, a once&#8208;forgotten antibiotic first isolated in 1953, is recently rediscovered as a novel inhibitor of Lyme disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi. Given the increasing resistance of gut microbes to antibiotic treatments, there is an urgent need for new therapies with novel mechanisms of action. The molecular architecture of hygromycin A, characterized by its fragmented structure, makes it an appealing platform for derivatization. In this study, it develops a latent functionality strategy to introduce the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketone motif into the sugar fragment via the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of furan. The facile epimerization at the C5 position enables a rapid access congeners of hygromycin A. Furthermore, glycosylation with phenol derivatives provides a versatile method for establishing the unique stereogenic center of the furanoside in this class of compounds.

         <title>Synthesis and Physicochemical Characterization of 6&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Spiro[3.3]Heptane Building Blocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decagram&#8208;scale synthesis of functionalized CF3&#8208;containing spiro[3.3]heptane building blocks (including alcohols, amines, boronates, carboxylic acid, and amino acids) starting from the commercially available materials is developed. Using model derivatives, the effects of the CF3 group on physicochemical and conformational properties of the title scaffold are elucidated and compared to those of nonfluorinated, monofluorinated, and gem&#8208;difluorinated counterparts.

A practical synthesis of 6&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)spiro[3.3]heptane&#8208;derived building blocks is developed. Starting from a commercially available cyclobutanone derivative, a key building block&#8212;1,1&#8208;bis(bromomethyl)&#8208;3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)cyclobutane&#8212;is prepared on a 0.5&#8201;kg scale in a single run. Further construction of the spiro[3.3]heptane core is achieved via double alkylation of TosMIC or malonate diester on up to 120&#8201;g scale. Simple functional group transformation provides access to a wide range of mono&#8208; and bifunctional spiro[3.3]heptane&#8208;derived building blocks, including alcohols, amines, boronate esters, carboxylic acids, and amino acids on a gram to multigram scale. Physicochemical properties (i.e., acidity pKa and lipophilicity LogP) are experimentally determined and compared to those for non&#8208;, mono&#8208;, and gem&#8208;difluorinated counterparts, as well as cyclohexane and cycloheptane derivatives. The spatial structure of the obtained compounds is evaluated by X&#8208;ray diffraction studies and characterized by exit vector plot analysis.

         <title>Tuning Glycosyl Donor Reactivity via Nitroarene Protecting Groups: A Semiarmed Strategy for Selective Glycosylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular strategy reports to tune glycosyl donor reactivity using nitroarene protecting groups. These groups suppress donor reactivity and can be chemically converted into activating groups, enabling a switchable system. This approach broadens the armed&#8211;disarmed glycosylation strategy and allows for efficient, selective oligosaccharide synthesis using precisely controlled donor reactivity.

Herein, a modular strategy for tuning the reactivity of glycosyl donors using nitroarene (NA) protecting groups such as 4&#8208;nitrobenzyl, 4&#8208;nitrobenzoyl, and 4&#8208;nitrophenyl. The electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of the nitro group markedly reduces donor reactivity, enabling selective activation. Notably, these NA groups can be readily transform into electron&#8208;donating pivaloylaminoarene (PA) and methoxycarbonylaminoarene (MCA) groups via nitro reduction followed by acylation or carbamation. This chemical conversion significantly enhances donor reactivity, offering a switchable reactivity platform. Relative reactivity values (RRVs), determined through competitive glycosylation, establish the reactivity trend: NA &lt; arene &lt; PA &lt; MCA. Applying this strategy, an efficient synthesis of a series of disaccharides is achieved, demonstrating its utility in extending the conventional armed&#8211;disarmed approach in glycosylation chemistry.

         <title>Photocatalytic Cyclopropanation of Allenoates with 1,3,4&#8208;Oxadiazolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spirocyclic compounds are key scaffolds in many drugs and other bioactive molecules. While cyclopropanation of allenes is relatively straightforward, synthesis of spirocyclic compounds from these substrates is scarce. We report a photocatalytic, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free cyclopropanation of allenoates with oxadiazolines as carbene precursors . Thioxanthone, serving as an energy transfer catalyst, enables mild reaction conditions and short reaction times.

Spirocyclic compounds are valuable scaffolds in medicinal chemistry and are important components of numerous drugs and other bioactive molecules. Although the cyclopropanation of allenes using typical methods is relatively straightforward, only limited approaches for the synthesis of spirocyclic compounds from allenoates have been reported. Herein, a photocatalytic, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free cyclopropanation of these substrates using oxadiazolines as a source of nucleophilic carbenes is described. The application of thioxanthone as an energy transfer catalyst under violet light irradiation enables the formation of alkylidenecyclopropanes in synthetically useful yields.

         <title>Adding &#8220;Energy&#8221; to Chalcogenophene Chemistry: Electrosynthesis of 2,3,5&#8208;Trisubstituted Selenyl&#8208;Chalcogenophenes and Their Interaction with DNA</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrosynthetic method is developed for synthesizing selenyl&#8208;chalcogenophenes via intramolecular cyclization of (Z)&#8208;chalcogenenynes under mild conditions and without external oxidants. Density functional theory calculations and cyclic voltammetry support the experimental results and help propose plausible mechanistic pathways.

Herein, an efficient and more environmentally benign electrosynthetic approach is reported for the intramolecular chalcogeno cyclization of (Z)&#8208;chalcogenoenynes, resulting in seleno&#8208;chalcogenophene derivatives. The reaction proceeds in an undivided cell in constant current and equipped with platinum electrodes by using 5&#8201;mL of acetonitrile as a solvent, 0.2&#8201;mmol of the (Z)&#8208;chalcogenoenyne, 2 equiv. of diorganoyl diselenide and 0.2 equiv. of electrolyte, 18 overall compounds are synthesized with yields between 52% and 97%. Control experiments and density functional theory studies are also conducted to propose plausible mechanistic pathways. Furthermore, selected compounds are screened via spectrophotometric titration to assess their potential interactions with DNA, with results indicating that both groove and intercalation interactions occure depending on the structure and concentration of the seleno&#8208;chalcogenophene compound. This electrochemical procedure presents itself as a viable and cost&#8208;effective alternative for the synthesis of chalcogenophenes, as it doesn't require external oxidants, operates under mild reaction conditions, and affords its products in good to excellent yields.

         <title>Exhaustive Hydrodechlorination of Trichloroacetamides under Electrochemical Conditions at Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogenation of trichloroacetamides to afford structurally diverse acetamide derivatives is achieved under environmentally benign, mild electrochemical conditions through an iodide&#8208;mediated crucial halogen&#8208;bonding interaction. The reaction mechanism is fully established by control experiments and by in&#8201;situ cyclic voltammetry.

A simple yet efficient electrochemical method is developed for accessing acetamide derivatives from allylic trichloroacetamides derived from the Overman reaction, even though the transformation is synthetically challenging under reductive conditions. The proposed mechanistic pathway of the reaction is fully supported by control experiments and electrochemical studies. Other attractive features, such as inexpensive electrode material and electrolytes, minimal chemical waste, broad substrate scope, consistent yield, operational simplicity, and scalability, make this method appealing.

         <title>Photoinduced Copper Catalyzed C(sp2)&#63743;P Bond Formation by Coupling of Diphenylphosphine with Aryl Iodides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced Ullmann&#8208;type C&#63743;P bond&#8208;forming reaction is accomplished at room temperature with no additional ligand. This method features broad substrate scope, scalability, and product transformation.

A photoinduced copper&#8208;catalyzed coupling of diphenylphosphine with aryl halides is reported. This efficient C(sp2)&#63743;P bond formation is realized by blue LED irradiation of a copper(I) catalyst at room temperature with no additional ligand. A variety of sterically demanding and functionalized substrates are applied under mild reaction conditions to provide the corresponding triarylphosphines in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Two Metals, One Goal: Unlocking Reactivity with Heterobimetallic Systems for Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review involves heterobimetallic catalytic systems that provides access to various organic transformations which are obscure with conventional monometallic systems. It throws light on diverse organic reactions such as alkylation, alkenylation, arylation, annulation, cross&#8208;coupling, and oxidative and decarboxylative coupling presented in conherent with their mechanism and catalytic cycle.

The design of heterobimetallic catalysis is redefining the frontiers in organic synthesis by harnessing the combined power of two distinct metals. It maneuvers a powerful platform in advancing organic transformations through leveraging cooperative synergetic effect of bimetals. In this review, this study unveils heterobimetallic systems that unlock challenging bond activations and novel reaction pathways inaccessible to traditional monometallic systems. It highlights key examples across diverse reaction classes of organic transformation paving way for alkylation, alkenylation, arylation, annulation, cross&#8208;coupling, and oxidative and decarboxylative coupling reactions for the synthesis of pharmaceutically and industrially relevant molecules. The review consolidates on the current updates on the reactions, mechanism, catalytic cycle, and their synthetic transformations. Heterobimetallic catalysts deliver amplified reactivity, expanded substrate diversity, and sharpened selectivity profiles. The bimetallic catalytic system orchestrates multielectron redox&#8208;processes, dual&#8208;site activation, and high turnover numbers. The review concludes with a brief outlook on the future scope, offering a blueprint for next&#8208;generation catalytic platforms that push the boundaries of molecular construction.

         <title>Sustainable Synthesis of Isoxazoles and Isoxazolines Directly from Aldehydes via One&#8208;Pot Metal&#8208;Free Approach Using a Reusable Ionic Liquid [C8DABCO][OH] at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a one&#8208;pot and a multistep approach for the regioselective formation of 3,5&#8208;disubstituted isoxazoles, isoxazolines, and bis&#8208;isoxazoles at room temperature. The metal&#8208;free method enhances product yield, allowing lower catalyst loading, reduced reaction time, and broad substrate tolerance . Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and reusability of the ionic&#8208;liquid underscore its sustainable advantages, reinforcing the efficiency and eco&#8208;friendliness of the protocol.

Isoxazole and isoxazoline derivatives demonstrate versatile therapeutic properties, captivating widespread global attention. Despite the potential benefits of these scaffolds, hurdles such as reliance on cytotoxic and expensive metal catalysts, low productivity, and limited substrate scope impede their effective synthesis. In this work, a 1,4&#8208;Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, based ionic liquid has been developed for the sustainable and eco&#8208;friendly synthesis of isoxazole and isoxazoline derivatives under metal and solvent&#8208;free conditions from chloroaldoximes. The room temperature mediated protocol framed the desired 3,5&#8208;disubstituted and 3,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted compounds, tolerating an array of functionalized and substituted chloroaldoximes, alkynes, and olefins. Moreover, this basic catalytic system even formulates the generation of bis&#8208;isoxazole derivatives and fabricates a one&#8208;pot telescopic strategy for forming the 3,5&#8208;isomer directly from aldehydes. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction done on three of the synthesized compounds confirms the formation of the 3,5&#8208;disubstituted isoxazole and bis&#8208;isoxazole derivatives. In addition, formation of some interesting, unusual products other than the desired isoxazole derivatives provides a new insight into this cycloaddition reaction. The reusability of the catalytic system for up to four consecutive runs and the successful outcome of the gram&#8208;scale reactions illustrate the synthetic efficiency of the protocol.

         <title>Multicomponent Synthesis of Fluorine&#8208;Containing Bioactive Compounds and Drugs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicomponent reactions are robust synthetic tools to assamble complex polyheterocycles and other interesting molecular architectures with potential application in medicinal chemistry, including their fluorine&#8208;containing analogues. Fluorine atoms placed strategically into bioactive molecules often enhance essential pharmacokinetic parameters like bioavailability, lipophilicity and metabolic resistance. Indeed, various marketed drugs contain fluorine atoms in their structures.

It is well known that fluorine atoms placed strategically into bioactive molecules often enhance essential pharmacokinetic parameters like bioavailability, lipophilicity, and metabolic resistance. In the same way, a relatively broad spectrum of marketed drugs contains one or more fluorine atoms in their structures, usually in the form of fluorine&#8208;, difluoromethyl&#8208;, trifluoromethyl&#8208;, or perfluoroalkyl aromatic moieties, being essential parts of their corresponding pharmacophores. Besides, multicomponent reactions (MCR) are highly convergent one&#8208;pot processes in which three or more smartly substituted/functionalized reagents are combined simultaneously, sequentially or consecutively, in the same reactor to assemble complex products (including polyheterocycles) containing most or all atoms from the reagents. Thus, the scope of the present review is to discuss selected MCR&#8208;based works since 2009 for the synthesis of bioactive compounds and drugs that contain at least one fluorine atom in their structures, as well as relevant results from in silico, in&#8201;vitro, and/or in&#8201;vivo studies against a variety of important target biomolecules, highlighting the role of fluorine&#8208;containing moieties.

         <dc:description>
A cycloaddition strategy for the synthesis of 10&#8208;aryl&#8208;11H&#8208;indeno[2,1&#8208;a]azulenes, as well as their derivatives, is presented. The work highlights improve reactivity using enamines from 1&#8208;indanone and pyrrolidine, followed by electrophilic chlorination and oxidation. Structural, optical, and electrochemical investigations elucidate unique properties, offering promising applications in organic electronic and photonic devices.

An efficient synthesis of 10&#8208;aryl&#8208;11H&#8208;indeno[2,1&#8208;a]azulenes has achieved via [8&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition between 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;cyclohepta[b]furan&#8208;2&#8208;ones with an enamine is generated from 1&#8208;indanone and pyrrolidine in good yields. Oxidation of 10&#8208;aryl&#8208;11H&#8208;indeno[2,1&#8208;a]azulenes with 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;p&#8208;benzoquinone in aqueous acetone shows complete decomposition, whereas chlorinated derivatives undergoes the oxidation to afford the corresponding azuleno[2,1&#8208;a]indenones in moderate to good yields. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals that the 11H&#8208;indeno[2,1&#8208;a]azulene and azuleno[2,1&#8208;a]indenone cores are remarkably planar, while the appended aryl groups adopt a nearly orthogonal orientation owing to steric hindrance, thereby limiting conjugative interactions. Ultraviolet&#8208;visible and fluorescence spectroscopic investigations, supported by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations, indicated that the optical transitions are predominantly localized on the azulene unit and are subtly modulated by the electronic nature of the aryl substituents. In addition, electrochemical studies also demonstrate systematic variations in redox potentials according to the electronic characteristics of the aryl groups.

         <title>Multigram Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation of Functionalized Terminal Alkynes with B2Pin2</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Application of cheap and accessible reactants for copper&#8208;mediated borylation of functionalized terminal alkynes is described. Based on the thorough assessment of different ligands/additives for various types of substrates, a simple decision tree for the optimal reaction condition choice is proposed. Using the developed methodology, a series of synthetically valuable alkenyl boronates is prepared on 10&#8211;300&#8201;g scale in single run.

A comprehensive study of the commercially available ligands/additives in the formal copper&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration reaction of functionalized terminal alkynes is described. Based on the common reaction system (CuCl&#8211;B2Pin2), a set of common and inexpensive ligands or additives&#8212;namely, rac&#8208;BINAP, PPh3, [(t&#8208;Bu)3PH]BF4, and LiCl&#8212;is tested for its effects on the borylation regioselectivity and overall reaction efficiency. The results observed demonstrate correlation between the substrate nature (propargylic, homopropargylic, or higher homolog) and the ligand, which can be used for the preferential preparation of linear or branched isomer of the target alkenyl boronic species. It is found that LiCl and (t&#8208;Bu)3P can be used for preparation of &#946;&#8208;substituted alkenyl boronates, whereas &#945;&#8208;substituted isomers are preferentially obtained in the presence of triarylphopsphine ligands. The scope of the transformations covers derivatives of protected (homo)propargylic alcohols and amines and tolerated free alcohol, ether, silyl ether, ketal, ester, and alkene moieties. The practical utility of the discussed methodologies is proven by the multigram preparation of target building blocks (10&#8230;100&#8201;g for over 20 boronates, up to 300&#8201;g&#8212;for a few selected representatives).

         <title>Copper Coils as Efficient and Inexpensive Reactors for the Synthesis of Tetrazoles in Flow Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;coil reactors are used for the synthesis of tetrazoles starting from benzonitriles in continuous flow. The reaction is carried out at high temperatures and residence times, in the presence of sodium azide, making the flow chemistry approach safer than the batch alternatives. Several tetrazoles have been prepared, including a key precursor of sartan drugs.

Sartans are an important family of drugs used to treat hypertension. A common characteristic of most of them is a biphenyl moiety with a tetrazole ring in the ortho position of the phenyl&#8211;phenyl bond. This tetrazole is typically synthesized from the respective nitriles through a [3&#8201;+&#8201;2] azide&#8208;nitrile cycloaddition. However, the use of large amounts of azides at high temperatures for extended periods of time is inherently concerning, as serious accidents can occur if safety protocols are not thoroughly developed and implemented. The implementation of these procedures in continuous flow would therefore be beneficial from the safety perspective. In this article, a method is presented for the preparation of tetrazoles from the respective nitriles employing a copper coil as reactor and catalyst. The reaction parameters have been studied and optimized to maximize conversion. A variety of benzonitriles with different ring substituents have been transformed in moderate to good yields and copper leaching has been analyzed, showing that the copper leached is enough to catalyze this reaction. More interestingly, the method has been applied to obtain the tetrazole ring present in a key intermediate used in sartan manufacturing, a highly sterically hindered compound.

         <title>Substrate Divergent 4&#960;/6&#960; Electrocyclization of CF3&#8208;Quinolone Heterodendralenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A substrate&#8208;dependent 4&#960;/6&#960; electrocyclization of in&#8201;situ generated CF3&#8208;heterodendralenes from 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;trifluoroacetyl quinolones is described. Phenyl substitution favors 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization to give CF3&#8208;substituted cyclobuta[c]quinolones bearing a CF3&#8208;containing quaternary center, while vinyl substitution promotes 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization to yield CF3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;phenanthridones.

Herein, a substrate&#8208;divergent 4&#960;/6&#960; electrocyclization of hitherto unknown CF3&#8208;heterodendralenes is disclosed, generated in&#8201;situ from the 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;trifluoroacetyl quinolones.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Alkynylthiolation of Tertiary &#945;&#8208;Carbonyl Bromides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free alkynylthiolation of tertiary &#945;&#8208;carbonyl bromides with 1,2,3&#8208;thiadiazoles. Those reactions involve the in&#8208;situ generation of alkynylthiolate anions from 1,2,3&#8208;thiadiazoles in the presence of a base and then their halogenophilic nucleophilic substitution (SN2X) reactions. The exceptionally mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance highlight the utility of this method to prepare privileged motifs from readily available 1,2,3&#8208;thiadiazoles and tertiary &#945;&#8208;carbonyl bromides feedstocks. Gram&#8208;scale reaction and diverse synthetic transformations convincingly demonstrate the synthetic potential of this method.</dc:description>

         <title>New Approaches in Catalytic Reactions Using Triphos: A Classical Privileged Ligand |</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past decades multiple catalytic transformations have been feasible due to the application of triphos as ligand. Its particular fac coordination mode to a transition metal center provides a suitable flexibility enabling variation on the coordination mode resulting in metal stabilization. Most of the reported catalytic reactions have been dominated by the use of the ruthenium&#8208;triphos system, either by application of well&#8208;defined complexes or the in situ formed complex. However, in the last years the emergence of cobalt complexes with comparable or even superior catalytic performance than ruthenium have been reported. In this review we have focused on the use of triphos in selected reactions such as N&#8208;alkylation, formic acid dehydrogenation and bond cleavage.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Bioorthogonal Mycolic Acids: Chemoselective Reduction of &#946;&#8208;Ketoesters Containing an Alkyne Using the Noyori Catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric reduction of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters using the Noyori catalyst is a highly effective synthetic methodology, offering excellent stereocontrol for the preparation of enantiopure b&#8208;hydroxyesters from prochiral substrates in high yields. This reaction has been used in the total synthesis of mycolic acids, which are &#945;&#8208;alkyl, &#946;&#8208;hydroxy fatty acids forming the main part of the mycobacterial cell outer membrane. Recently, the metabolism of mycobacteria has been explored using the chemical reporter strategy with bioorthogonal analogues or precursors of mycolic acids. Introducing a bioorthogonal alkyne into these compounds is a challenging task and particularly valuable for subsequent probe attachment via click chemistry. This work presents approaches for the synthesis of several alkyne&#8208;containing mycolic acids featuring the native structure of natural mycolic acids. The chemoselectivity of the enantioselective reduction of several b&#8208;ketoesters using the Noyori catalyst in the presence of a protected terminal alkyne group was investigated. Conditions have been optimized to ensure that the alkyne remains intact during the reduction process. This study provides valuable tools for further mycomembrane studies using the CuAAC reaction and the optimized conditions extends the possibilities in the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters with an alkyne function.</dc:description>

         <title>Point&#8208;to&#8208;axis optical activity induction in extended, sterically congested chromophoric systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The readily available, modular and electronic circular dichroism (ECD)&#8208;silent derivatives of terephthalaldehyde (the probes) have exhibited an induced optical activity upon condensation with chiral primary amines. The central unit of the probe serves as an amine binder by forming imine bonds and is flanked by two extended chromophoric units (&#8220;the wings&#8221;). Modification of the wings by diphenylamine or carbazole units affects the sterical and spectroscopic properties of the probes. An increase in sterical congestion within the probe core resulted in a change in the mechanism of optical activity induction. In the more congested systems, the point&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transmission from the chiral amine (the inducer) to the chromophoric system led to the adaptation of helical conformation by &#8220;the wings&#8221; and the appearance of non&#8208;zero Cotton effects (CEs) in the low&#8208;energy part of the ECD spectrum. However, the sterically congested probes were sensitive to the chirality of the inducers but relatively indifferent to the differences in their structure. Thus, the chirality of the inducers triggers conformational change towards the thermodynamically preferred conformational diastereoisomer due to the probe's &#8212;1 &#8208; +1 operation scheme.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated Silyl Esters and Silyl Phosphonates Over Cyclopropanation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated silyl esters are an important class of compounds in organic, inorganic and pharmaceutical chemistry, known for their versatility and unique reactivity. The conjugated system in these compounds enables for Michael addition reactions, making them useful intermediates in the synthesis of complex organic/inorganic molecules, including pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and natural products. Having realized the importance of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated silyl esters, we have devised a strategy to synthesize various functionalized allyl and vinyl silanes using diazo compounds and respective silanes. Herein we have demonstrated that the allyl and vinyl silanes can react with diazo compounds in a chemoselective manner offering a versatile method for constructing C&#8208;C bond formation over the cyclopropanation reaction in the presence of 1 mol% of [Cp*RuCl2]n as a catalyst under mild conditions. Direct C&#8208;H bond functionalization of allyl and vinyl silanes with alpha diazo esters and phosphonate diazo showcasing the adaptability of silicon&#8208;based chemistry in modern organic synthesis. The plausible mechanism of the reaction has been realized with the help of DFT calculations. All the synthesized &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated siliyl esters were isolated and characterized by using sophisticated analytical and spectroscopic techniques.</dc:description>
