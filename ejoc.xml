      <title>Visible Light Photocatalytic Synthesis of Tetrahydroquinolines under Batch and Flow Conditions</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, we describe the use of visible light and a photocatalytic system for the cyclization of iodoaryl vinyl derivatives to tetrahydroquinoline structures. The reaction proceeds under very mild conditions, tolerates different functional groups and more importantly, the method allows the synthesis of  N  &#8208;free tetrahydroquinolines from  N  &#8208;unprotected starting materials. In addition, the reaction can also be performed using flow&#8208;chemistry. Finally, a mechanistic proposal based on some mechanistic studies has been described.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of 3,5&#8208;Disubstituted 1,2&#8208;Dioxolanes</title>
      <dc:description>Endoperoxides are a source of bioactive compounds which drove to some important anti&#8208;malarial drugs such as artemisinin or arterolane. 1,2&#8208;Dioxolanes drew the attention of many scientists, through the isolation of numerous natural products containing this peroxidized ring structure such as the plakinic acid family or the biosynthetic study of prostaglandins. Thus, a considerable work was reported for the synthesis of such endoperoxides, but mainly applied to the synthesis of 3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208; tetrasubstituted 1,2&#8208;dioxolanes. The recent isolation of new natural products containing a 3,5&#8208;disubstituted dioxolane ring brought our attention on how to specifically prepare such structures. Herein, we tentatively summarize exhaustively all the methods reported for the synthesis of 3,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2&#8208;dioxolanes. Therefore, nucleophilic substitution with hydrogen peroxide or hydroperoxide, use of electrophilic oxygen singlet, use of oxygen triplet in radical reaction and the chemistry of peroxycarbenium ions will be presented for this purpose.</dc:description>

  A new and efficient catalytic strategy that combines organocatalysis and iodine catalysis was first developed for the difunctionalization of dienone.

      <title>Rhodium catalysts with a chiral cyclopentadienyl ligand derived from natural R&#8208;myrtenal</title>

      <title>Towards the Total Synthesis of Jerangolids &#8208; Synthesis of an Advanced Intermediate for the Pharmacophore Substructure</title>
      <dc:description>The jerangolids are a class of natural products with a skipped diene substructure isolated from  Sorangium cellulosum  . Here, we present a new strategy for the total synthesis of these compounds based on a skipped diyne as central building block and a suitably substituted epoxy aldehyde as bulding block for the dihydropyran substructure. So far, we reached an advanced intermediate which is related to the pharmacophore subunit of the jerangolids as well as of the ambruticins. A key step is a Shi epoxidation with high e.r. to form the epoxy aldehyde. Both building blocks are coupled in a Carreira alkynylation, where additional mechanistic studies based on DFT calculation were realized. The alkynylation is followed by a nucleophilic 6&#8208;endo&#8208;tet epoxide opening to form the pyrane structure and a Nicholas reduction to remove a propargylic OH group.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Carbon&#8722;carbon bond formation is a fundamental transformation of synthetic organic chemistry. This minireview focuses on our works related to reductive aldol reaction, reductive Mannich reaction, reductive &#945;&#8208;acylation, and reductive &#945;&#8208;carboxylation by using rhodium catalyst to achieve C&#8722;C bond formation.

This condition could apply to other electrophiles such as imines, acid chlorides, and acid anhydrides, and the corresponding &#946;&#8208;lactams, or &#946;&#8208;ketocarbonyl compounds were obtained in good yields, respectively. A key intermediate, Rh&#8722;H complex would play an important role to accomplish 1,4&#8208;reduction, which could easily be derived from RhCl(PPh  3  )  3  and Et  2  Zn.

      <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows schematically each reaction step in the total synthesis of a depsipeptidic natural product, FE399, with time. In the presence of MNBA combined with a nucleophilic catalyst DMAP or DMAPO, the ester bond formation and the subsequent peptide bond formation smoothly proceeded to afford the cyclic precursor, which was then subjected to the MNBA&#8208;mediated macrolactamization to afford the desired macrolactam core of FE399 in high yield. Eventually, the total synthesis of FE399 was successfully achieved. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Tonoi, I. Shiina et al.

      <title>Selectivity in the Addition of Electron Deficient Radicals to the C2 Position of Indoles</title>
      <dc:description>The addition of electron deficient radicals to the  C2  position of indoles has been described in the literature as opposed to electrophilic addition at the  C  3 position. Density functional theory calculations were used to understand the switch in regioselectivity from  C3  to  C2  for indole to undergo radical additions. Electron deficient radicals have a lower barrier for reaction at  C  2 and a lower energy radical intermediate that benefits from benzylic radical stabilization. Trifluoromethyl radical addition has a lower energy barrier than acetonitrile radical, and the  C  3 addition transition state is just 1.3 kcal/mol higher than  C2  . This is supported by experimental observations.</dc:description>

Synthetically, the scaffolds were constructed by Sonogashira coupling reactions between an iodo&#8208;functionalized IF&#8208;TTF and an acceptor moeity containing a terminal alkyne. These very first IF&#8208;TTF based candidates for DSCs exhibited high performances, in particular a dye incorporating a benzothiadiazole acceptor moiety, showing a conversion efficiency of 6.4%. This result signals that IF&#8208;TTF derivatives present a promising class of compounds for further structural modifications. Such modifications will benefit from the readiness of the iodo&#8208;funcitonalized IF&#8208;TTF building block to undergo Pd&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions.</dc:description>

      <title>A new synthetic strategy leading to homochiral macrocycles derived from 2,6&#8208;diformylpyridine and (1S,2S)&#8208;trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclopentane.</title>
      <dc:description>The condensation of enantiomerically pure  trans  &#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclopentane (DACP) with 2,6&#8208;diformylpyridine (DFP) in methanol followed by reduction results in a mixture of 2+2, 3+3, 4+4 and 5+5 macrocyclic amines, which allowed the separation of small amounts of new large 4+4 and 5+5 products using GPC. The replacement of DACP with the extended 2+1 primary diamine, containing two DACP and one DFP moieties, results in a new dynamic library in the condensation reaction with DFP. This library afforded the 4+4 macrocycle as the main product together with a considerable amount of a giant 6+6 macrocycle. Conversely, the similar reaction of enantiomerically pure DACP with the extended 1+2 dialdehyde, comprising of one DACP and two DFP units, leads almost exclusively to the 2+2 macrocycle, whereas the condensation of both extended 2+1 diamine and 1+2 dialdehyde precursors delivers selectively the 3+3 macrocycle. The tendency for formation of larger macrocycles in the condensation of the extended 2+1 primary diamine with DFP and lack of such preference in the reaction of DACP with the extended 1+2 dialdehyde was supported by theoretical calculations. The obtained macrocyclic amines were converted to their salts with hydrochloric or sulfuric acid. The crystal structures of the protonated forms of 2+2, 3+3 and 4+4 macrocyclic amines (and model structure of the 6+6 macrocycle) indicate binding of chloride or sulphate anions in the cavities formed by the folding of the macrocycles.</dc:description>

      <title>Iso&#8208;maleimycin, a Constitutional Isomer of Maleimycin, from Streptomyces sp. QL37</title>
      <dc:description>
  Streptomyces sp. QL37 produces a previously undescribed constitutional isomer of the known antibiotic maleimycin, which received the name iso&#8208;maleimycin. Chemical synthesis was used to access reference samples of iso&#8208;maleimycin and maleimycin. GC&#8208;MS analysis and comparison with a bacterial isolate unambiguously revealed the presence of iso&#8208;maleimycin, but not maleimycin.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Iso&#8208;maleimycin, a previously unknown constitutional isomer of the antibiotic maleimycin, has been detected in an extract of Streptomyces sp. QL37. Chemical synthesis of both maleimycin (20&#8201;% yield over seven steps) and iso&#8208;maleimycin, (15&#8201;% yield over six steps) allowed access to reference materials for identification. Gas Chromatography coupled Mass Spectrometry (GC&#8208;MS) analysis demonstrated that of the two isomers, only iso&#8208;maleimycin was present in the extract. This finding supports our hypothesis that iso&#8208;maleimycin is a biosynthetic intermediate of lugdunomycin. Iso&#8208;maleimycin displays low antibiotic activity, with a Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) value on both E. coli and B. subtilis of 250 &#181;g/mL.

      <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Arylations of Heteroarenes with Polyfluoroalkoxy&#8208;Substituted Bromobenzenes</title>
      <dc:description>
  Di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;fluoroalkoxy&#8208;substituted bromobenzenes were successfully employed in the direct arylation of 5&#8208;membered ring heteroarenes using Pd&#8208;catalysis. The use of these polyfluoroalkoxy&#8208;substituted bromobenzenes in direct arylation is simpler than the use of bromophenols, as they display a higher reactivity, and as there is no need to introduce a polyfluoroalkyl group to obtain the (polyfluoroalkoxy)benzenes.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The reactivity of di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;fluoroalkoxy&#8208;substituted bromobenzenes in the direct arylation of 5&#8208;membered ring heteroarenes using palladium catalysis was explored. High yields in arylated heteroarenes were obtained using only 1 mol&#8208;% of Pd(OAc)2 catalyst with KOAc as an inexpensive base. Similar yields were obtained with o/m/p trifluoromethoxy&#8208;, o/p difluoromethoxy&#8208;, and tetrafluoroethoxy&#8208;substituents on the aryl bromide. A bromo&#8208;substituted difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxole was successfully coupled. The major side&#8208;products of the reaction are HBr/KOAc. Therefore, this synthetic scheme is very attractive for the access to such polyfluoroalkoxy&#8208;containing arylated heteroaromatics in terms of cost, simplicity, and low environmental impact, compared to reactions involving arylation of heteroarenes with bromophenols followed by polyfluoroalkylation.

High yields in arylated heteroarenes were obtained using only 1 mol&#8208;% of Pd(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst with KOAc as an inexpensive base. Similar yields were obtained with &lt;i&gt;o/m/p&lt;/i&gt; trifluoromethoxy&#8208;, &lt;i&gt;o/p&lt;/i&gt; difluoromethoxy&#8208;, and tetrafluoroethoxy&#8208;substituents on the aryl bromide. A bromo&#8208;substituted difluorobenzo[&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;][1,3]dioxole was successfully coupled. The major side&#8208;products of the reaction are HBr/KOAc. Therefore, this synthetic scheme is very attractive for the access to such polyfluoroalkoxy&#8208;containing arylated heteroaromatics in terms of cost, simplicity, and low environmental impact, compared to reactions involving arylation of heteroarenes with bromophenols followed by polyfluoroalkylation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Investigation of Straightforward, Photoinduced Alkylations of Electron&#8208;Rich Heterocompounds with Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkyl Bromides in the Sole Presence of 2,6&#8208;Lutidine</title>
      <dc:description>
  No need for a complex photosensitizer: We introduce a method for selective photoinduced alkylations of electron&#8208;rich heterocompounds with electron&#8208;deficient allyl bromides in the presence of 2,6&#8208;lutidine at 365 or 405 nm. Mechanistic investigations reveal that a colored intermediate formed from 2,6&#8208;lutidine and alkyl bromide is involved in the photoactivation. Our approach uses commercially available reagents and a straightforward protocol.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Alkylations of simple electron&#8208;rich heterocompounds deliver valuable target structures in bioorganic and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we present a straightforward and photosensitizer free approach for the photoinduced C&#8211;C coupling of electron&#8208;rich unsaturated heterocompounds with alkyl bromides using 405 nm and 365 nm irradiation. Comprehensive mechanistic studies indicate the involvement of 2,6&#8208;lutidine in the formation of a non&#8208;covalently bound intermediate to which the function of a photosensitizer is attributed. UV/Vis spectra reveal the formation of a bathochromic shifted band when the electron&#8208;deficient alkyl bromide is mixed with the structural motif of 2,6&#8208;substituted pyridine. Upon photochemical excitation of this band, we find the initiation of the C&#8211;C bond&#8208;forming reaction. Using this approach highly versatile alkylation products, e.g. &#945;&#8208;substituted ketones and 2&#8208;substituted furan, thiophene, and pyrrole derivatives, are obtained in high selectivity. Furthermore, this synthetic methodology can be applied to access substituted indoles, which cannot be obtained by other transformations.

      <title>Novel application of polymer networks carrying tertiary amines as catalyst inside microflow reactors used for Knoevenagel reactions</title>
      <dc:description>A novel application is described for utilizing hydrogel dots as organocatalyst carriers inside microfluidic reactors. Tertiary amines were covalently immobilized in the hydrogel dots. Due to the diffusion of reactants within the swollen hydrogel dots, the accessible amount of catalysts inside a microfluidic reactor chamber can be increased compared to the accessible amount of surface&#8208;bound catalysts. To perform fast Knoevenagel reactions, important flow parameters had to be validated to optimize the reactor performance while keeping the dimensions of the reactor chamber constant; e. g. the height of the hydrogel dots had to be adjusted to the invariable dimensions of the reactor chamber, or an adjustment of organocatalysts in the hydrogel dots had to be validated to achieve the highest conversion rate during a certain residence time. To characterize the conversion, NMR and UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;spectroscopy were utilized as an offline and online method, respectively. With suitable hydrogel dots, the influence of different flow parameters (e.g., operating flow rate and reactant concentration) on the selected model reactions in the microfluidic reactor was investigated. Finally, a variety of reactants were screened with the optimized flow parameters. With these results, the turnover frequency was determined for the Knoevenagel reactions in a microfluidic reactor, and the results were compared with published data that were determined by other synthetic approaches.</dc:description>

A possible mechanism involving hydrazonyl radicals and N&#8211;I(III) intermediates of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated hydrazones is proposed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mild Deprotection of Dithioacetals by TMSCl/NaI Association in CH3CN</title>
      <dc:description>
  TMSCl associated with NaI was used to deprotect various dithioacetals in CH3CN with good to excellent yields. This metal&#8208;free process can also be applied with success for the regeneration of carbonyl of O,O&#8208;acetals, O,S&#8208;oxathianes, S,N&#8208;acetals, ketimines, and hydrazones.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  A mild process using a combination of TMSCl and NaI in acetonitrile is used to regenerate carbonyl compounds from a variety of dithiane and dithiolane derivatives. This easy to handle and inexpensive protocol is also efficient to deprotect oxygenated and mixed acetals as 1,3&#8208;dioxanes, 1,3&#8208;dioxolanes and 1,3&#8208;oxathianes quantitatively. As a possible extension of this method, it was also shown that nitrogenated substrates such as hydrazones, N&#8208;tosylhydrazones, and ketimines reacted well under these conditions to give the expected ketones in high yields. The methodology proposed herein is a good alternative to the existing methods since it does not use metals, oxidants, reducing agents, acidic or basic media, and keto&#8208;products were obtained in high to excellent yields.

      <title>Successive Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative Cross&#8208;Couplings for the Modular Synthesis of Non&#8208;Symmetric Di&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Substituted Thiophenes</title>
      <dc:description>
  A thiophene building block, with opposing bromide and ester&#8208;protected acid moieties, is utilized as a starting material for the efficient synthesis of an array of non&#8208;symmetric, di&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted thiophene through successive decarboxylative palladium&#8208;catalyzed couplings, with an intermediate saponification step.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Oligothiophenes are important organic molecules in a number of burgeoning industries as semi&#8208;conducting materials due to their extensive &#960;&#8208;conjugation and charge transport properties. Typically, non&#8208;symmetric, di&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted thiophenes are prepared by the successive formation of Grignards, organotin, and/or boronic acid intermediates that can be subsequently employed in cross&#8208;coupling reactions. While reliable, these approaches present synthetic difficulties due to the reactivity of organo&#8208;metallic/pseudo&#8208;metallic species, and produce considerable amounts of waste due to necessary pre&#8208;functionalization. We have developed a decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling route as an effective strategy for the modular and less wasteful synthesis of a wide range of non&#8208;symmetric, di&#8208;arylthiophenes. This method uses a thiophene ester building block for successive decarboxylative palladium&#8208;catalyzed couplings that allows for the efficient synthesis and evaluation of the opto&#8208;electronic properties of a library of candidate semi&#8208;conductors with functional groups that could be challenging to access using previous routes.

     alt="Successive Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative Cross&#8208;Couplings for the Modular Synthesis of Non&#8208;Symmetric Di&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Substituted Thiophenes"/&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A thiophene building block, with opposing bromide and ester&#8208;protected acid moieties, is utilized as a starting material for the efficient synthesis of an array of non&#8208;symmetric, di&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted thiophene through successive decarboxylative palladium&#8208;catalyzed couplings, with an intermediate saponification step.
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Oligothiophenes are important organic molecules in a number of burgeoning industries as semi&#8208;conducting materials due to their extensive &#960;&#8208;conjugation and charge transport properties. Typically, non&#8208;symmetric, di&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted thiophenes are prepared by the successive formation of Grignards, organotin, and/or boronic acid intermediates that can be subsequently employed in cross&#8208;coupling reactions. While reliable, these approaches present synthetic difficulties due to the reactivity of organo&#8208;metallic/pseudo&#8208;metallic species, and produce considerable amounts of waste due to necessary pre&#8208;functionalization. We have developed a decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling route as an effective strategy for the modular and less wasteful synthesis of a wide range of non&#8208;symmetric, di&#8208;arylthiophenes. This method uses a thiophene ester building block for successive decarboxylative palladium&#8208;catalyzed couplings that allows for the efficient synthesis and evaluation of the opto&#8208;electronic properties of a library of candidate semi&#8208;conductors with functional groups that could be challenging to access using previous routes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intramolecular Cyclization of Brominated Oxime Ether Promoted with Ytterbium(0) to the Synthesis of Cyclic Imines</title>
      <dc:description>
  A general, efficient, and experimentally simple one&#8208;pot new method for the synthesis of cyclic imines through intramolecular cyclization of brominated oxime ether promoted by ytterbium(0) was reported for the first time. In this new strategy for the construction of cyclic imines, the N&#8211;O bond is used as a receptor of ytterbium reagent rather than as a source of N&#8208;centred radical.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The first utility of ytterbium(0) as a mediating&#8208;metal in the intramolecular cyclization of brominated oxime ether was reported in this paper. In contrast to the prior methods, the N&#8211;O bond was used as a receptor of nucleophilic reagent, rather than as a source of N&#8208;centered radicals. Cyclic imines were obtained in this one&#8208;pot reaction with a broad scope of substrates and feasible reaction conditions.

      <title>A Decade of Muricatacin Synthesis and Beyond</title>
      <dc:description>
  Various syntheses of both the muricatacin enantiomers and analogues adopting different strategies in the last decade are described in this review. Additionaly, the strategic use of muricatacin as starting point in synthesis of reticulatacin, cis&#8208;solamins and giganin is covered.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  In this review, we have abstracted the various syntheses of both enantiomers of muricatacin (a member of a bigger class of acetogenins, ACGs), over the last decade (2010&#8211;2020). Developments in the synthesis of various epimers, homologues, oxa&#8208;analogues, &#948;&#8208;lactones, and the furofuranone analogues are also enfolded in this review. Most of the synthesis involve chiral pool and catalytic enantioselective approaches, while a few are hinged on the use of chiral auxiliary and resolution methods. Muricatacin with orthogonally differentiated two oxy&#8208;functions also serve as a start point in the synthesis of higher molecules of the acetogenin family, for example, cis&#8208;solamins, and these have also been covered herein.

      <title>Dehydrative Ring&#8208;Opening of gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropyl Carbinols to Allylic Trifluoromethyl and Difluorohalomethyl Derivatives Promated by Titanium Tetrahalide</title>
      <dc:description>
  An effective approach to (E)&#8208;allylic CF3, (E)&#8208;allylic CF2Cl, (E)&#8208;allylic CF2Br derivatives, 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluoromethylene, and polyfluorinated compounds has been developed, based on a titanium tetrahalide&#8208;promoted dehydrative ring&#8208;opening of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropyl carbinols.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  We report herein the titanium tetrahalide&#8208;promoted dehydrative ring&#8208;opening of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropyl carbinols as a novel method for the synthesis of (E)&#8208;allylic CF3, (E)&#8208;allylic CF2Cl, and (E)&#8208;allylic CF2Br compounds. This TiF4&#8208;promoted reaction appears to proceed via a concerted SN2' mechanism. A control experiment revealed that the TiCl4&#8208;promoted ring&#8208;opening initially proceeds by conversion of the gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropyl carbinol into a gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropyl chloride intermediate.

      <title>ortho&#8208;Phenylene&#8208;Based Macrocyclic Hydrocarbons Assembled Using Olefin Metathesis</title>
      <dc:description>
  Macrocycles have been assembled from vinyl&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;phenylenes using olefin metathesis. The major products are trimers with congested, twisted structures. Characterization by NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and DFT calculations show that heterochiral configurations are favored. Photophysical properties are also discussed.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  While many foldamer systems reliably fold into well&#8208;defined secondary structures, higher order structure remains a challenge. A simple strategy for the organization of folded subunits in space is to link them together within a macrocycle. Previous work has shown that o&#8208;phenylenes can be co&#8208;assembled with rod&#8208;shaped linkers into twisted macrocycles, showing an interesting synergy between folding and thermodynamically controlled macrocyclization. In these systems the foldamer units were largely decoupled from each other both conformationally and electronically. Here, we show that hydrocarbon macrocycles, with very short ethenylene linkers, can be assembled from o&#8208;phenylenes using olefin metathesis. Characterization by NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and ab initio calculations shows that the products are approximately triangular trimer macrocycles with helical o&#8208;phenylene corners in a heterochiral configuration. Their photophysics are dominated by the 4,4'&#8208;diphenylstilbene moieties, the longest conjugated segments, with further conjugation broken by the twisting of the o&#8208;phenylenes.

      <title>Catalytic Hydrosilylation of Hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs): Synthesis of New Fluorinated Silanes and Diversity of their Synthetic Character</title>
      <dc:description>
  We present here the hydrosilylation of commercially available hydrofloroolefins catalyzed by Pt, Pd, and Rh complexes as an efficient route toward a family of new polyfluorinated silanes as well as their use as versatile building blocks for subsequent functionalization based on C&#8211;F and C&#8208;Si bond activation.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  New polyfluorinated silanes were synthesized via the Pt, Rh and Pd catalyzed hydrosilylation of commercially available hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) in moderate to excellent yields. HFO&#8208;1234yf (2,3,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropene&#8208;1) and &#8211;1234ze (1,3,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropene&#8208;1) were reactive with Pt catalyst to form tetrafluoropropylsilanes along with defluorosilylation products. The Z&#8208; and E&#8208;isomers of HFO&#8208;1336mzz (1,1,1,4,4,4&#8208;hexafluorobut&#8208;2&#8208;ene) gave the desired silanes with Pd catalysis in good to excellent yields, while with Pt catalyst only the dehydrofluorination product CF2=CHCH2CF3 (HFO&#8208;1345czf, 1,1,4,4,4&#8208;pentafluorobut&#8208;1&#8208;ene) was obtained. Synthetic applications of the new polyfluorinated silanes were illustrated by conversion of dichloro(hexafluorobutyl)(methyl)silane to the cyclic trisiloxane, which can serve as a monomer for the preparation of polysiloxanes. In addition, the hexafluorobutylsilanes showed defluorinative reactivity with lithium reagents, thereby demonstrating their synthetic utility as valuable building blocks for further transformations via C&#8211;F and C&#8208;Si bond activation.

      <title>Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of a Library of AGE&#8208;Related Amino Acid Triazole Crosslinkers</title>
      <dc:description>Three  N  &#8208;Boc&#8208;protected amino acids, L&#8208;serine, L&#8208;aspartic and L&#8208;glutamic acid, were either converted into their methyl azidoalkanoates or into various alkynes via Bestmann&#8208;Ohira strategy, or via reaction with proparylamine and propargyl bromide, respectively. The Cu&#8208;catalyzed click reaction provided a library of amino acid based triazoles, which were further  N  &#8208;methylated to triazolium iodides or deprotected and precipitated as free amino acid triazole dihydrochlorides. The biological properties of all derivatives were investigated by cytotoxicity assay (against L929 mouse fibroblasts) and broth microdilution method (  E. coli  &#916;TolC and  S. aureus  ). First results reveal complete inactivity for triazolium iodides with cell viabilities and microbial growths nearly 100%, indicating them as possible analogues of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs).</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Three  N  &#8208;Boc&#8208;protected amino acids, L&#8208;serine, L&#8208;aspartic and L&#8208;glutamic acid, were either converted into their methyl azidoalkanoates or into various alkynes via Bestmann&#8208;Ohira strategy, or via reaction with proparylamine and propargyl bromide, respectively. The Cu&#8208;catalyzed click reaction provided a library of amino acid based triazoles, which were further  N  &#8208;methylated to triazolium iodides or deprotected and precipitated as free amino acid triazole dihydrochlorides. The biological properties of all derivatives were investigated by cytotoxicity assay (against L929 mouse fibroblasts) and broth microdilution method (  E. coli  &#916;TolC and  S. aureus  ). First results reveal complete inactivity for triazolium iodides with cell viabilities and microbial growths nearly 100%, indicating them as possible analogues of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>One&#8208;Electron Reduction of Redox&#8208;Active Esters to Generate Carbon&#8208;Centered Radicals</title>
      <dc:description>
  Radical decarboxylative functionalization of redox&#8208;active esters induced by one&#8208;electron reductions (OER) has recently become a research focus in synthetic chemistry. Here we present the new advances using redox&#8208;active esters as carbon&#8208;centered radical precursors to form carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The one&#8208;electron reduction (OER) can profoundly affect the structure and reactivity of organic compounds. OER induced radical decarboxylative functionalizations of redox&#8208;active esters have gained wide concerns in this century. In this review, we present recent advances using redox&#8208;active esters as carbon&#8208;centered radical precursors to form carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds.

      <title>Mechanism and Regioselectivity of Intramolecular [2+2] Cycloaddition of Ene&#8211;Ketenes: A DFT Study</title>
      <dc:description>Intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of ene&#8211;ketenes gives either fused&#8208;ring (via normal [2+2] cycloaddition) or bridged&#8208;ring (via cross&#8208;[2+2] cycloaddition) cyclobutanones. For example, terminal ene&#8211;ketenes give the fused&#8208;ring cycloadducts, whereas dimethyl&#8208;substituted ene&#8211;ketenes furnish bridged&#8208;ring cycloadducts. For monomethyl&#8208;substituted ene&#8211;ketenes, both [2+2] cycloadducts are generated. However, there are no systematic theoretical studies on such a regiochemistry in the literature. Here we report our DFT study on the mechanism and regioselectivity of these intramolecular [2+2] cycloadditions. DFT calculations reveal that both normal and cross&#8208;[2+2] cycloadditions are concerted processes. The normal [2+2] cycloaddition transition state is forming an internal carbocation while the cross&#8208;[2+2] cycloaddition transition state is generating an external carbocation (see  Scheme 1  of the paper). On the basis of the relative stability of these carbocations, which is affected by both the tether and the substituent(s) on the alkene, a regiochemistry prediction model is proposed to understand and predict the reaction outcome.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A simple approach for a C&#8208;N bond&#8208;forming reaction is developed using a multicomponent strategy. Iodine catalyzed multicomponent reaction of heterocyclic thiols, aromatic aldehydes, and trimethoxybenzene proceeds at the ambient temperature in TFE in a short period. The reaction is also compatible with aromatic thiols leading to C&#8208;S bond formation. Heterocyclic thiols undergo a chemoselective reaction affording the corresponding C&#8208;N products over C&#8208;S products. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report for C&#8208;N bond formation using heterocyclic thiols, trimethoxybenzene, and aromatic aldehydes, where the solvent is playing a significant role and iodine is acting as a promotor.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
  Three&#8208;component one pot assembly of 4&#8208;fluoropyrazoles is described. The method involves formal oxidative [3+2]&#8208;annulation between elusive fluoroalkynes and azomethine imines.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  A new approach for the synthesis of highly pharmaceutically relevant 4&#8208;fluoropyrazoles via oxidative annulation of &#945;&#8208;fluoronitroalkenes with in situ prepared hydrazones was developed. The reaction is efficiently promoted by trifluoroacetic acid while atmospheric oxygen was used as an oxidant. Broad substrate scope was demonstrated, using both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient nitroalkenes as well as different hydrazones derived from aromatic aldehydes. The mechanistic details were also outlined.

  The asymmetric catalytic Mukaiyama Michael reaction between &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes and silyl enol ether derived from a cyclic ketone was catalyzed by diphenylprolinol silyl ether to afford Michael products with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. Bicyclo[2.2.2]octanone derivatives can be synthesized as a single isomer in a nearly optically pure form via a two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot reaction, comprising the sequential Mukaiyama Michael reaction and intramolecular Michael reaction starting from dienol silyl ether and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, catalyzed by diphenylprolinol silyl ether.

By contrast, their 132 &#8208;stereochemical inversion (epimerization) occurred more rapidly, and the removal of their central magnesium (pheophytinization) was more tolerant than Chl&#8208;a due to the electronic effect of the fluorine atom(s) through the chlorin &#960;&#8208;system in a molecule. Since a fluorine atom is comparable in the size to a hydrogen atom, these chemically stable fluorinated Chls&#8208;a are promising as the synthetic alternatives to naturally occurring Chl&#8208;a , and are useful for the structural and functional investigation in oxygenic phototrophs.</dc:description>

      <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Diastereoselective Synthesis of Spirocyclic Pyrrolidine&#8208;Lactones by 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition</title>
      <dc:description>
  Enantiomerically pure spirocyclic pyrrolidines are prepared by highly diastereoselective dipolar cycloaddition using chiral aminolactones. Silver shows dual catalysis activating the dipole and the dipolarophile simultaneously. Final products incorporated a high functional group density, a new quaternary sterogenic center, and a spiranic unit connecting a pyrrolidine and a lactone.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The preparation of two enantiomerically enriched amino lactones as chiral starting substrates for asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions is described. They act as precursors of the chiral imino lactones, which form in situ the corresponding azomethine ylides. They react with electrophilic alkenes under silver catalysis to afford spirolactone&#8208;pyrrolidines products. The sequential method consisting in one&#8208;pot imine formation &#8594; cycloaddition is optimized and compared with the multicomponent process. The scope of the reaction is studied as well as the stereochemical outcomes and the mechanistic details using DFT calculations and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

  The synthesis of C&#8208;glycosides is of great importance in the field of carbohydrate chemistry given its ubiquity in biologically active molecules. Herein, we describe a protocol for the Pd&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative Heck reaction of activated olefins and 2&#8208;iodoglycals. A variety of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated 2&#8208;ketoglycosides were obtained in up to 89&#8201;% yield using d&#8208;glucal, d&#8208;galactal, d&#8208;xylal, and l&#8208;arabinal derivatives.

      <title>From Natural Compounds to Bioactive Molecules through NMR and In Silico Methodologies</title>
      <dc:description>
  Natural products are a privileged class of compounds with high diversity which are suitable for inspiring new rationally designed multi&#8208;target drugs. Herein, a multi&#8208;disciplinary approach that covers the structural and pharmacological characterization of NPs for developing semisynthetic and synthetic derivatives with optimized potency/selectivity towards specific targets in the inflammatory/cancer field is proposed.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Marine and terrestrial organisms are an unlimited source of active secondary metabolites. They are characterized by high chemical diversity, biochemical specificity, and other molecular features that make them a valid starting point for lead generation in the drug discovery process. Considering the complex structural architecture and the high number of stereogenic centers, compared to the synthetic drugs, the elucidation of the 2D structure and the assessment of the precise 3D arrangements of natural products (NPs) provide essential insights into ligand&#8208;target interaction which can drive a rational lead optimization process. In this regard, the combination of NMR spectroscopy with modern computational techniques represents one of the most effective approaches to achieve this task. The DFT/NMR integrated method, and its application, in combination with the accurate ROE&#8208;distance analysis, have been employed as valid support, both to clarify the configuration and conformational profile of the active secondary metabolites and to shed more light on the molecular basis of their mechanism of action. Indeed, the comprehension at a molecular level of their interactions with specific targets involved in pathologies, like inflammation and cancer, represents a cornerstone for further investigations through computational tools like molecular docking and molecular dynamics. These high&#8208;efficiency in silico techniques play a crucial part in the drug discovery process as well as in lead optimization procedures. Furthermore, this integrated approach provides the identification of novel chemical platforms disclosing new bioactive molecules with enhanced potency and selectivity.

  The synthesis of versatile 5&#8208;amino functionalized 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles, both in the forms of N&#8208;heterocycle fused and acyclic amino group functionalized forms, have been realized via the annulation reactions of gem&#8208;diamino enaminones and tosyl azide under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The annulation reactions between gem&#8208;diamino enaminones (ketene aminals) and tosyl azide providing N&#8208;heterocycle fused and 5&#8208;amino side chain functionalized 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles have been developed. The synthesis of these N&#8208;side chain functionalized 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles has been executed with high efficiency and broad synthetic scope under transition metal&#8208;free conditions with the assistance of NaHCO3 only.

      <title>Spirooxazoline Synthesis by an Oxidative Dearomatizing Cyclization</title>
      <dc:description>
  The oxidative spirocyclization of phenols and naphthols containing pendent amides is described that grants access to unusual spirooxazoline compounds. These rare spirocycles are prepared by an iodine(I)/(III) catalytic cycle.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Spirocyclic compounds are of increasing importance owing to their potential applications in the development of new pharmaceuticals. Herein, we describe a new, rapid access to rarely seen spirooxazolines utilizing an I(I)/I(III) reaction manifold. The scope of the cyclization using phenols and naphthols is described along with the stereoselective functionalization of the spirocycles. The application of this method to the formation of dihydrooxazines is also demonstrated.

      <dc:description>Polyneuridine aldehyde is a key intermediate in the biosynthetic routes of monoterpene indole alkaloids family of natural products.

      <title>&#963;&#8208;Hole Interactions in Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
  This minireview summarizes the recent applications of halogen, chalcogen, and pnictogen bonding in organocatalysis. In all these cases, a Lewis&#8208;acidic region around an element of group 15&#8211;17 (the so&#8208;called &#963;&#8208;hole) interacts with the electron pair of a suitable Lewis base. Besides a discussion of recent applications, this review focuses on mechanistic investigations and comparisons between the different &#963;&#8208;hole interactions.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Noncovalent interactions like halogen, chalcogen, and pnictogen bonding are known for a very long time. During the last decade, these interactions have found different applications in catalysis. These forces are often called &#963;&#8208;hole interactions which can be explained by the anisotropic distribution of the electron density around these atoms. In this MiniReview, we will present recent applications of halogen, chalcogen, and pnictogen bonding in catalysis and discuss experimental and computational investigations to gain more insights into the underlying mechanisms.

      <title>Functionalization of Bis&#8208;Diazaphospholene P&#8211;P Bonds with Diverse Electrophiles</title>
      <dc:description>
  Diazaphospholene dimers readily react with aryl and alkyl halides to form carbon&#8211;phosphorus bonds without requiring catalysts, under mild conditions. Both polar and radical mechanisms are operative, depending on the substrate.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Phosphorus&#8208;sp3 or &#8208;sp2 carbon bonds are readily formed by the reaction of bis&#8208;diazaphospholenes with several classes of electrophiles. These reactions result in cleavage of the phosphorus&#8211;phosphorus bond and formation of functionalized diazaphospholenes. The reactions proceed rapidly, without catalysis. Experimental evidence with aryl and alkyl halides suggests the intermediacy of radicals in some cases, however other evidence suggests either radical or polar mechanisms may be operative for certain substrates, with a dependence on reaction conditions. In three cases, the product aryl diazaphospholenes have been shown to transfer the aryl substituent to electrophiles. These results reveal that diazaphospholene dimers are potent participants in radical chemistry with organic substrates at room temperature without requiring chemical initiators.

  N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) efficiently catalyze new bond formations with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity through umpolung and non&#8208;umpolung processes. These processes typically involve four species: Breslow intermediates, homoenolates, enolates, and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl azoliums. Organic syntheses are increasingly relying on NHC catalysis, and this minireview highlights developments in NHC&#8208;catalyzed reactions that, over the past two decades, have been used as key steps in the total syntheses of natural products. Crucial intermediates and reaction mechanisms are presented in detail.

      <title>Applications of Chiral Cyclopentadienyl (Cpx) Metal Complexes in Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Metal complexes containing cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ligands are versatile and robust catalysts widely applied in organic synthesis. During the last two decades chiral Cpx complexes have been applied in a variety of enantioselective transformations. Often associated with Group 9 metals (Co, Rh, Ir), chiral Cpx ligands have also been used in combination with early transition&#8208;metals and rare&#8208;earth elements. In this mini&#8208;review asymmetric reactions that have been successfully steered with chiral Cpx ligand metal complexes are discussed according to the metal coordinated. Several ligand designs have successfully been used in a diverse array of reactions, in particular C&#8208;H functionalisations, with binaphthyl&#8208;derived ligands leading the field. Challenges with these ligands derive from the need for their multi&#8208;step synthesis, and recently new ligands have been designed which can be accessed in shorter sequences from readily available starting materials.</dc:description>

In this mini&#8208;review asymmetric reactions that have been successfully steered with chiral Cpx ligand metal complexes are discussed according to the metal coordinated. Several ligand designs have successfully been used in a diverse array of reactions, in particular C&#8208;H functionalisations, with binaphthyl&#8208;derived ligands leading the field. Challenges with these ligands derive from the need for their multi&#8208;step synthesis, and recently new ligands have been designed which can be accessed in shorter sequences from readily available starting materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Metal and oxidant free construction of substituted&#8208; and/or polycyclic&#8208;indoles: a useful alternative to Bischler and related syntheses</title>
      <dc:description>A wide range of substituted indoles or polycyclic derivatives containing the indole core are easily accessible by acidic treatment of aromatic amines and 1,2&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes. Unlike the related indole&#8208;Bischler synthesis, the regioselectivity of the method here reported is unique and predictable, the yields are generally good and also electron withdrawing substituted indoles are smoothly recovered.</dc:description>

      <title>Carbohydrate based Ionic Liquids (CHILs): Synthesis and Applications</title>
      <dc:description>Carbohydrate based ionic liquids (CHILs) are a sub&#8208;class of ionic liquids which first emerged in 2007 and has since then attracted a steadily growing community of organic chemists. Since carbohydrates are naturally occurring materials with a broad spectrum of diastereomers, they are fitting materials for ionic liquids bearing stereochemical information. This review gives an up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of all CHILs and their applications in asymmetric chemistry.</dc:description>
