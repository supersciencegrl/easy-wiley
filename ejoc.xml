         <title>Molecular Break Junction: A Stage for Redox Transformations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An exceptionally brilliant strategy to miniaturize electronic devices is to employ a single&#8208;molecule between two electrodes for carrier conduction at single&#8208;molecule break junctions (SMBJ). To understand the intrinsic mechanisms of operation at these junctions, extremely crucial is to study physical, chemical, and electrochemical properties employing single&#8208;molecules at SMBJs. Further, redox&#8208;based transformations at the nano&#8208;junction could be achieved electrochemically to allow efficient switching between different redox states of a single&#8208;molecule, showcasing the possibility of maneuvering transport properties with on&#8208;off states of the molecule. Herein, are presented the fundamentals of SMBJs, and the electrochemically influenced transformations or switching of organic molecules pursued at SMBJs. Such an understanding of electrochemical phenomena at the nanoscale dimension could bridge the knowledge gap between macroscopic electronic circuits and single&#8208;molecule electronic circuits, whereby the feasibility of switching between the states could maneuver the electronic properties as well as other photophysical parameters.</dc:description>

         <title>Trends in the Reactivity of Pentacyclic Ether Derivatives on Silicon and Germanium Surfaces Revealed by Energy Decomposition Analysis for Extended Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the SN2 like ring opening reaction of pentacyclic ether derivatives with the heteroatoms O, S, Se, and Te on silicon and germanium (001) surfaces are investigated. The periodic trends for variation in group 14 elements of adsorbate and surface are analyzed using energy decomposition analysis for extended systems (pEDA) on the reaction path to enhance our understanding of surface chemistry and semiconductor functionalization.







Abstract
We analyze the adsorption and ring&#8208;opening reaction of pentacyclic chalcogen alkyls with chalcogen atoms ranging from oxygen to tellurium using computational analysis. Thus extends our previous investigation of THF on silicon towards germanium surface and towards the heavier chalcogen homologues. We found an increasing dative bond strength of the precursor state with the period of the chalcogen atom on both surfaces. Using energy decomposition analysis for extended systems (pEDA), differences in the trends between silicon and germanium were revealed. Following the dative bound state, subsequent ring&#8208;opening reactions were found to proceed via a nucleophilic back&#8208;side attack, similar to a molecular SN2 reaction. Reaction energies and barrier heights show a maximum for the sulfur derivative. This trend was found to correlate with the position of the transition state in the reaction and agrees with the molecular reactivity. The uniquely low barrier of THF can be attributed to its ring strain. Our findings shed light on the fundamental aspects of surface chemistry and the benefits of using quantitative bonding analysis in this field. It also paves the way for future explorations into the functionalization of semiconductor surfaces using higher&#8208;period ether derivatives.

         <title>Ruthenium Catalyzed Formation of Fused Pyridine Derivatives or Substituted Indoles from Hydrazine&#8208;Derived Enamines and Propargyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed transformations of secondary propargyl alcohols with hydrazine&#8208;derived enamines are presented, affording fused pyridines or substituted indoles depending on the hydrazine derivative used. The cascade reactions are catalyzed by an air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable bifunctional ruthenium complex and proceed via redox&#8208;isomerization of the propargyl alcohol, subsequent Michael addition and cyclocondensation. In case of phenylhydrazine a Fischer&#8208;indole synthesis also takes place, prior to the final release of the products. The produced heterocyclic motifs are important scaffolds in medicinal and agricultural chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Conversion Of N&#8208;Troponyl&#8208;Amino Acid Derivatives Into Cationic Troponyl&#8208;Oxazolidines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzoxazole and benzoxazolidine are constituents of various bioactive natural/synthetic molecules comprising benzenoid aromatic residue. However, non&#8208;benzenoid aromatic scaffolds such as tropone and tropolone are also found in natural products. This report describes the synthesis of unusual cationic troponyl&#8208;oxazolidine derivatives from N&#8208;troponyl&#8208;amino acids/peptides by Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed transformation. X&#8208;ray studies confirm the formation of the first tropylium cation annelated oxazolidine structures and support the formation of unique supramolecular self&#8208;assembly structures owing to the H&#8208;bonding. The CV studies of new tropylium cations reveal their reduction potential ca &#8208;1.2 V. Hence, cationic troponyl&#8208;oxazolidinyl amino acids/peptides could be promising analogs of benzoxazolidine for the development of therapeutic drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Roles of Divinylbenzene Co&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linker in &#160;a&#160;Threefold Cross&#8208;Linked Polystyrene&#8208;Phosphine Hybrid Monolith: Impact of Cross&#8208;Linking Degree on Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Continuous&#8208;flow organic transformations using immobilized catalysts are crucial for green and sustainable chemistry. Cross&#8208;linked polymer ligands offer high stability, ease of recovery through filtration, and thus enhance performance in continuous&#8208;flow reactions via transition&#8208;metal catalysis. Additionally, the cross&#8208;linking structure of the polymer support creates a unique reaction platform that controls the coordination behavior of the supported ligands and stabilizes the metal catalysts. However, insights into the material&#8208;based design for preparing highly active and durable immobilized metal catalysts are still limited. In this report, we propose a straightforward approach to boost both selective mono&#8208;coordination and effective stabilization of metal complexes. We developed threefold cross&#8208;linked polystyrene&#8208;triphenylphosphine hybrid monoliths with cross&#8208;linking structures adjusted by varying the content of divinylbenzene as co&#8208;cross&#8208;linker. The coordination behaviors and metal&#8208;support interactions of these monoliths were evaluated, highlighting the importance of co&#8208;cross&#8208;linker content in site&#8208;isolating phosphine units and stabilizing metal centers via arene&#8208;metal interactions on the polystyrene network. By optimizing the cross&#8208;linking structure, the monolith catalysts demonstrated exceptionally high catalytic activity and durability in Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;Cl transformations, such as Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings and Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig aminations in continuous flow. This underscores the utility of our monolith system in challenging transition&#8208;metal catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Aryl&#8208;fluorocyclopropane &#946;&#8208;lactams with activity against Mycobacteroides abscessus and Mycobacterium bovis BCG</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel series of aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluorocyclopropyl 1 and &#945;,&#946;,&#946;&#8208;trifluorocyclopropyl 2&#946;&#8208;lactams have been prepared and their activity explored across various Mycobacteria and also the ESKAPE panel of pathogens. The most active of these compounds 1a displayed good activity against clinically challenging Mycobacteria such as M. bovis BCG (MIC 0.39 mg/mL)) and did not show any significant activity against the ESKAPE pathogens indicating selectivity for this otherwise challenging class of pathogen. Compound 1a was however rapidly metabolised and toxic to a human model cell line (HepG2) limiting its clinical development at this stage. The compounds were designed to exploit a fluoride ion elimination mechanism concomitant with &#946;&#8208;lactam ring opening, as the basis of a mechanism induced trigger to generate a reactive intermediate (suicide inhibition). In model alkoxide reactions a representative from both classes 1 and 2 resulted in &#946;&#8208;lactam ring opening but only the more active mono&#8208;fluoro cyclopropane series 1 triggered fluoride ion elimination after ring opening and this may form the basis of its activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Thermodynamic Resolution of Unprotected Amino Acids Using Ni(II) Chiral Schiff Bases</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 36, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic thermodynamic resolution of racemic unprotected amino acids with the Ni(II) chiral Schiff base complex are described. This method can be easily applied to a variety of unprotected amino acids to obtain optical pure amino acids and the side chain modified amino acid derivatives.







Abstract
Dynamic thermodynamic resolution of amino acids (AAs) using Ni(II) chiral Schiff bases is one of the simplest and most efficient methods to obtain optically active AAs. A comparison of the reactivity of 36 rac&#8208;AAs with the Ni(II) complex revealed that this method can be easily applied to dynamic thermodynamic resolution and S/R interconversion of AAs with unprotected active functional groups. It can also be really applied for the side&#8208;chain modification of AA derivatives with active functional groups on the Ni(II) complex. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activities of the synthesized Ni(II) complexes were evaluated, and the Ni(II) complexes [(S,S)&#8722;3&#8201;g, (S,S)&#8722;3&#8201;h, and (S,S)&#8722;3&#8201;i] showed remarkable antibacterial activity against Micrococcus luteus, a Gram positive bacterium.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Threshold Analysis for Chemical Space Mapping of Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Couplings</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 36, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By mapping Ni&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling yields onto a plot of ligand buried volume and minimum electrostatic potential, we identified the area of monophosphine ligand space best suited for this reaction. Reported here is a generalizable workflow for identifying physicochemical descriptors that best classify the chemical space for a given reaction.







Abstract
A key challenge in synthetic chemistry is the selection of high&#8208;performing ligands for cross&#8208;coupling reactions. To address this challenge, this work presents a classification workflow to identify physicochemical descriptors that bin monophosphine ligands as active or inactive in Ni&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reactions. Using five previously published high&#8208;throughput experimentation datasets for training, we found that a binary classifier using a phosphine's minimum buried volume and Boltzmann&#8208;averaged minimum electrostatic potential is most effective at distinguishing high and low&#8208;yielding ligands. Experimental validations are also presented. Using the two physicochemical descriptors from the binary classifier to represent the chemical space of monophosphine ligands leads to a more predictive guide for structure&#8208;reactivity relationships compared with classic chemical space representations.

         <title>Stable and Reusable Pd/Cu Bimetallic Nanoparticle Catalysts for the Synthesis of Hydroxy Isoindolones by Domino C&#8722;H Activation and Annulation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 36, September 23, 2024. </description>

Binaphthyl&#8208;stabilized palladium&#8211;copper bimetallic nanoparticles (Pd/Cu&#8208;BNP) catalyzed the synthesis of 3&#8208;hydroxyisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones/thiones derivatives by domino C&#8722;H activation followed by C&#8722;N bond formation. The catalyst was recovered and reused for four successive cycles without any appreciable change in particle size. One of the substrates was used to synthesize a BRD4 inhibitor.







Abstract
A domino C&#8722;H activation and annulation process catalyzed by stable and reusable bimetallic nanoparticles (Pd/Cu&#8208;binapthyl nanoparticles) was developed for the synthesis of 3&#8208;hydroxyisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones/thiones. The scope of the reaction was examined utilizing a variety of N&#8208;alkoxy benzamide/benzothioamide derivatives and benzaldehydes, which yielded moderate to good yields of 3&#8208;hydroxyisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones/thiones, one of which was used to synthesize a BRD4 inhibitor. A gram&#8208;scale synthesis is also reported. The Pd/Cu&#8208;binapthyl nanocatalyst has been recovered and reused up to four times without any major change in particle size and reactivity.

         <title>Amide&#8208;Derived Norbornadienes: Towards Efficient Molecular Solar Thermal Systems in Polar Solvents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 36, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of four NBD&#8208;derivatives based on amide substituents are reported. They show good properties as MOST systems and can operate under polar solvents such as alcohols. The photoisomerization and back&#8208;conversion catalyzed reaction are characterized.







Abstract
Solar energy harvesting is a promising alternative to the escalating energy demand. Among emerging technologies, MOlecular Solar Thermal (MOST) systems offer exciting avenues for solar fuel generation. However, their widespread application is partially hindered by the use of environmentally problematic and potentially hazardous organic non&#8208;polar solvents, such as toluene. Addressing this challenge, we here developed a series of four norbornadienes (NBDs) featuring symmetric amide substituents via functionalization of the readily available diacid substituted NBD. These compounds exhibit enhanced solubility in greener alcohol solvents (up to 0.1&#8197;M in EtOH), a significant advancement over non&#8208;polar NBDs. Moreover, computational characterization of the back&#8208;conversion reaction was performed by DFT calculations. The reversible switching was demonstrated for three new NBDs through photoisomerization via UV&#8208;light absorption to form QC, with quantum yields ranging from &lt;1 to 15&#8201;%. In addition, reversible catalysis was performed via a commercial heterogeneous gold&#8208;based catalyst.

         <dc:description>
One&#8208;pot synthesis of 7&#8208;imino&#8208;1,7&#8208;dihydrobenzo[e][1,2,4]triazines starting from the corresponding polyfluorinated benzohydrazonoyl chlorides was accomplished. The method involves the formation of Blatter radicals and their subsequent C6,C7&#8208;regioselective interaction with aniline in the presence of MnO2.







Abstract
Derivatives of the first substituted 7&#8208;imino&#8208;1,7&#8208;dihydrobenzo[e][1,2,4]triazines, namely 1&#8208;(2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoropyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;N,3&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;7&#8208;(phenylimino)&#8208;1,7&#8208;dihydrobenzo[e][1,2,4]triazin&#8208;6&#8208;amine and 1&#8208;(pentafluorophenyl)&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;7&#8208;(phenylimino)&#8208;3&#8208;(2,3,4,5&#8208;tetrafluorophenyl)&#8208;1,7&#8208;dihydrobenzo[e][1,2,4]triazin&#8208;6&#8208;amine, were unexpectedly isolated as the only products in yields of about 20&#8211;30&#8201;% after an attempt to obtain Blatter radicals from the corresponding amidrazones bearing polyfluorinated electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents. All new compounds were fully characterized, and their molecular and crystal structure was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Regioselective Halogenation of 2&#8208;Oxindoles and &#946;&#8208;Keto Esters Using Oxone&#8208;Halide With or Without Aryl Iodine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 36, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Environmentally friendly and regioselective halogenation protocols, especially green fluorination protocols of 2&#8208;oxindoles and &#946;&#8208;keto esters are developed by manipulation of the components of the oxone&#8208;halide&#8208;aryl iodine system.







Abstract
Efficient and environmentally benign regioselective halogenation protocols have been achieved through the mediation of oxone&#8208;halide, with or without the assistance of aryl iodine. The key to the success of the regioselectivity process is the controlled generation of the active [X]+ or halogen&#8208;substituted hypervalent iodine (III) by manipulating the components of the oxone&#8208;halide&#8208;aryl iodine system.

         <title>NaBH4&#8208;Induced Chemoselective Mechanochemical Neat Synthesis of Bio&#8208;Active Dihydrofuran/&#1013;&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Esters and Synthetic Application to Isoindoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 36, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have established NaBH4&#8208;induced very short and efficient green (E&#8208;factor=0.40) chemoselective synthetic route of bioactive fused dihydrofuran and silica gel controlled &#1013;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters under solvent&#8208;free grindstone chemistry. Synthetic application of &#1013;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters to isoindoles and antileishmania investigation of alcohol/dihydrofuran derivatives are another footprint of our developed protocol.







Abstract
The synthesis of small heterocycles under neat mechanochemical conditions is of great interest in the field of drug design because most of the commercially available drugs contain at least one heterocyclic unit. The sodium borohydride (NaBH4) promoted reductive cyclization to fused dihydrofuran under grinding technique is one of the compendium additions for the clean future. The development of chemoselective reduction under silica&#8208;gel supported conditions represents significant progress in organic synthesis, offering a versatile and efficient method for selective reduction of specific functional groups within complex molecules. Synthesis of isoindole derivatives from the chemoselective reduce product via a sustainable short synthetic pathway is another significant process of our newly developed protocol. Finally, antileishmanial investigations of our synthesized compounds establish a soft bridge between biology and chemistry.

This work reports the unprecedented synthesis of tetrazene&#8208;based cobalt complexes using unusual coupling of amines via dehydrogenation. These cobalt complexes were employed for dehydrogenative coupling reactions to synthesize N&#8208;heterocycles (quinoline, and quinazolinone). The mechanistic investigation involved conducting control experiments and identifying intermediates through IR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Herein we first report the unprecedented synthesis of tetrazene&#8208;based cobalt complexes using unusual coupling of amines via dehydrogenation. These cobalt complexes were employed for dehydrogenative coupling reactions to synthesize N&#8208;heterocycles (quinoline, and quinazolinone). Based on control experiments and IR identification of intermediates, we proposed a plausible reaction mechanism. Synthesis protocols were utilized for preparative scale synthesis and biologically active molecule (&#177;)&#8208;galipinine synthesis.

         <title>Disrupting Substance Use Disorder: The Chemistry of Iboga Alkaloids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 36, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The iboga alkaloid class of monoterpene indole alkaloids have long inspired synthetic chemists in their structural complexity and dense functionalization. Their unique anti&#8208;addictive properties have propelled this class of natural products into potential lead compounds for drug discovery efforts as well. This present review covers the synthetic strategies and tactics used in their synthesis over the last 70&#8197;years.







Abstract
The iboga alkaloids are a family of monoterpene indole alkaloids first discovered from the root of Tabernanthe iboga. The major alkaloid constituent in the root, ibogaine, has garnered interest for its anti&#8208;addictive properties. Ibogaine has been shown to reduce opiate, amphetamine, alcohol, and nicotine self&#8208;administration in rodents. However, ibogaine itself is less than optimal as a treatment in humans for Substance Abuse Disorder (SUD) due to its cardiotoxicity and hallucinogenic potential. Instead, ibogaine is an attractive lead for drug discovery efforts. Indeed, several notable programs have been launched to both elucidate ibogaine's mechanism of action and reduce its toxicity. While there have been over 20 total syntheses of ibogamine, ibogaine, and closely related family members, there are far fewer syntheses of recently isolated iboga alkaloids. In this targeted review, we discuss the synthetic strategies applied to the synthesis of classical and non&#8208;classical iboga alkaloids.

         <title>Diethyl Mesoxalate, A Representative Tricarbonyl Compound &#8211; A Useful Synthetic Tool Possessing Diverse Reactivities</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 36, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diethyl mesoxalate (DEMO) is a highly useful synthetic reagent to exhibit diverse reactivities because of the high electrophilicity and multiple functionalities, The bulkiness of DEMO enables the stereo control to realize enantioselective/diastereoselective reactions. It is also possible to accelerate Diels&#8211;Alder reactions by chelation of the ester carbonyls.







Abstract
Diethyl mesoxalate, a vicinal tricarbonyl compound, possesses multiple functionalities that facilitate diverse chemical conversions. The central carbonyl group with two ester functionalities exhibits high electrophilicity to accept nucleophilic attacks of various reagents. This unusual electrophilicity enables the reaction with acid amides that are not common nucleophiles in organic syntheses. Condensation with active methylene compounds or amines leads to electron&#8208;deficient alkenes and imines, respectively, which can be transformed into more complex polyfunctionalized compounds by a second nucleophilic addition. Chemical transformations between the central and adjacent ester carbonyls furnish new ring systems that are useful in material and pharmaceutical sciences. The central carbonyl group can also be built into a ring system by reacting with reagents possessing nucleophilic and electrophilic sites. Furthermore, the central carbonyl serves as a dienophile that undergoes cycloaddition to form functionalized heterocyclic compounds in a single step.

         <title>Mechanochemical Organocatalysis: Simple Chiral Primary Diamine&#8208;TfOH&#8208;catalysed Asymmetric Aldol and Robinson Annulation Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemical organocatalysis, which integrates mechanochemistry and organocatalysis to provide a metal&#8208;and solvent&#8208;free synthetic method for synthesizing chiral products, has garnered significant interest recently due to its importance in green chemistry. In this study, simple, unmodified commercially available chiral primary diamines with TfOH were employed as catalysts in mechanochemical direct asymmetric aldol and Robinson annulation reactions. This protocol demonstrated high efficiency, atom economy and high stereoselectivity. Notably, direct asymmetric aldol reactions involving unreactive aromatic methyl ketones, which still is a challenge for mechanochemical organocatalysis, proceeded smoothly. Additionally, the first mechanochemical asymmetric Robinson annulation reaction was reported and chiral 3,5&#8208;diaryl&#8208;cyclohexenones were efficiently synthesized using this method. These findings highlight the potential of mechanochemical organocatalysis for asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient hydrogenation of organic compounds employing low&#8208;cost and easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize catalysts is highly desirable as the corresponding hydrogenated products have significant importance in pharmaceutical and fine&#8208;chemical industries. Herein, a cobalt(II) complex supported by &#945;&#8208;diimine ligand has been easily prepared by treatment of anhydrous CoCl2 with diimine, which can catalyze the hydrogenation of unsaturated bond with ammonia borane as the hydrogen source. A variety of ketones and aldimines bearing diverse functional groups can be reduced to corresponding alcohols and amines in moderate to excellent yields at ambient conditions. It is noteworthy that several readily reducible functional groups such as nitro and cyano are tolerated under the standard reaction conditions. Furthermore, the gram&#8208;scale reaction has been successfully carried out and the procedure could be handled easily, which both make this methodology general and practical.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Flow Spirocyclization Reactions: Towards Efficient Synthesis of Chiral Spiropenicillanates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe the development of a continuous flow approach to chiral spiropenicillanates with remarkable bioactive properties from 6&#8208;alkylidenepenicillanates via phosphine&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of allenoates or via 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition with diphenyldiazomethane.
Model reactions were carried out using simple alkenes, such as methyl vinyl ketone and&#160;N&#8208;substituted maleimides, leading to the corresponding products in excellent yields (up to 96%). The [3+2] annulation reaction was subsequently extended to the reactivity of 6&#8208;alkylidenepenicillanates, a more complex 2&#960;&#8208;component with an exocyclic carbon&#8208;carbon double bond, allowing the synthesis of spirocyclic compounds. Two regioisomeric chiral spirocyclopentene&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams were obtained, in moderate to good overall yields (31&#8208;84%). The 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions between 6&#8208;alkylidenepenicillanates and diphenyldiazomethane under continuous flow conditions&#160;gave the corresponding spiro&#8208;1&#8208;pyrazolinepenicillanates in high yields (up to 81%).&#160;Thermal ring contraction, via N2&#160;extrusion, of spiro&#8208;1&#8208;pyrazolinepenicillanates under continuous&#160;flow conditions led&#160;to spirocyclopropanepenicillanates in quantitative yields.&#160;
The continuous flow proved to be an efficient methodology for the synthesis of&#160;spiropenicillanates and represents&#160;a more sustainable approach for the scale&#8208;up synthesis of spiropenicillanates with relevant biological activity.</dc:description>

         <title>[4+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition Reactions to Corannulene Accelerated by &#951;6&#8208;Coordination of Ruthenium Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination of Ru complexes to corannulene increases substantially its reactivity as a dienophile in Diels&#8208;Alder reactions because of the Pauli repulsion&#8208;lowering effect. Lowering of the repulsive Pauli repulsion term is driven by the charge transfer from the corannulene to the metal moiety.







Abstract
The influence of different (LRu)nII (L=Cp&#8211; (n=1, 2); C6H6) moieties &#951;6&#8208;coordinated to corannulene ((CpRu)+, (Benzene)Ru2+ and (CpRu)22+) has been explored by using the Activation Strain Model (ASM) of reactivity together with the Energy Decomposition Analysis (EDA) scheme. The results obtained have been compared with those obtained for the non&#8208;coordinated corannulene counterpart. It has been observed that the presence of the ruthenium moiety favors both kinetically and thermodynamically the [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction with cyclopentadiene. The factors governing these differences depend on the nature of the [Ru] complex. Whereas the interaction energy is solely responsible for the lower activation energy for the monocationic system (CpRu)+, not only the higher interaction but also the lower strain energy explain the much higher reactivity observed for the dicationic systems ((C6H6)Ru2+ and (CpRu)22+). In this latter case, the Pauli repulsion energy term is the factor controlling the differences in the interaction energies, following the so&#8208;called Pauli repulsion&#8208;lowering concept. Finally, when &#951;6&#8208;coordinating mono&#8208; or dicationic ruthenium complexes, although the [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction in the external rim bonds remains the thermodynamically and kinetically more favourable, the cycloaddition becomes also thermodynamically feasible in some internal bonds.

         <title>Organocatalyzed Approach to the Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Pyrones via Hydration/Cyclization of Skipped Diynones under Basic Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The so far reported procedures for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;pyrones via hydration/cyclization of skipped diynones employ acid or metal&#8208;catalyzed conditions. Herein we present the first example of a secondary amine&#8208;organocatalyzed approach. The transformation proceeds via formation of an intermediate E&#8208;enaminone, which gradually reacts with H2O yielding an acetylenic &#946;&#8208;diketone. Under the basic reaction conditions, the acetylenic diketone cyclizes to &#947;&#8208;pyrone.







Abstract
In the presence of catalytic amounts of a secondary amine (e.&#8201;g. morpholine), skipped diynones undergo hydration/cyclization in aqueous acetonitrile to form &#947;&#8208;pyrones in moderate to excellent yields (30&#8211;92&#8201;%). The first step of the process involves a trans&#8208;stereoselective conjugate&#8208;addition of morpholine to the ynone to form an intermediate E&#8208;enaminone. Gradually this intermediate reacts with H2O yielding an acetylenic &#946;&#8208;diketone via nucleophilic vinylic substitution. Under the basic reaction conditions, acetylenic &#946;&#8208;diketones cyclize to &#947;&#8208;pyrones. Primary amines fail to promote efficiently the process, as the initially formed Z&#8208;configurated enaminones are reluctant to react smoothly under standard reaction conditions.

     alt="Organocatalyzed Approach to the Synthesis of &#947;-Pyrones via Hydration/Cyclization of Skipped Diynones under Basic Conditions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so far reported procedures for the synthesis of &#947;-pyrones via hydration/cyclization of skipped diynones employ acid or metal-catalyzed conditions. Herein we present the first example of a secondary amine-organocatalyzed approach. The transformation proceeds via formation of an intermediate &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-enaminone, which gradually reacts with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O yielding an acetylenic &#946;-diketone. Under the basic reaction conditions, the acetylenic diketone cyclizes to &#947;-pyrone.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of o&#8208;Iodoanilines with Acrylates or Acrylic Acids: A Convenient One&#8208;Step Route to 2&#8208;Quinolinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and convenient method is developed for the synthesis of 2&#8208;quinolinones from o&#8208;iodoanilines with acrylates or acrylic acids. The key to achieve the cyclization reaction is to utilize redox&#8208;neutral base. The reaction mechanism involving a Heck coupling intermediate is well investigated.







Abstract
A convenient and general method for the construction of 2&#8208;quinolinones was developed in this paper. The Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction of various o&#8208;iodoanilines with acrylates or acrylic acids proceeded smoothly to produce 2&#8208;quinolinones in 28&#8211;&gt;99&#8201;% yields. The key to achieve the cyclization reaction is to utilize suitable base, such as potassium pivalate and potassium acetate. Various synthetically useful functional groups, such as halogen atoms, methoxycarbonyl, and nitro groups, remained intact during the reaction. The effects of catalyst and base on this cyclization reaction and kinetic experiments were investigated to understand the aspect of the reaction.

         <dc:description>Indeno[2,1&#8208;b]indole and shikimic acid&#8208;like structures are natural privileged scaffolds in several bioactive NPs. In this work, we developed a high&#8208;efficient and diastereoselective synthetic approach to the construction of novel indeno[2,1&#8208;b]indole/shikimic acid hybrid analogues via photo&#8208;Nazarov reaction. The protocol is the first case of excited&#8208;state photo&#8208;Nazarov cyclization of indole&#8208;2&#8208;yl vinyl ketone to indeno[2,1&#8208;b]indole. And the yield of (6aS, 10aR)&#8208;product was up to 91% after the condition optimization. Even more attractive, several synthesized analogues exhibit potent RANKL&#8208;induced osteoclastogenesis inhibitory activities, which suggests promising prospect of the novel indeno[2,1&#8208;b]indole/shikimic acid hybrid scaffold for anti&#8208;osteoporosis drug development.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Hemiindigo Derivatives via a Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Cyclization Strategy</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We described a gold&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of Z&#8208;hemiindigo frameworks from ortho&#8208;propynol phenyl azides via the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene intermediates. The intermediates are trapped by water or acetone and then subsequently undergo enol tautomerization and dehydration, or release of acetone. The reaction has the advantage of being able to be carried out under mild conditions and on a gram&#8208;scale. Importantly, this method enables a simple and efficient synthesis of the special hemiindigo derivatives for the development of environmentally sensitive photoswitches in biological systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Intramolecular Rauhut&#8208;Currier Reaction on a Labile Framework of Enone and Acrylamide: Tricyclohexylphosphine as a Stable and Economical Catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intramolecular Rauhut&#8208;Currier (IRC) reaction is an atom&#8208;economical way of making carbocyclic and heterocyclic rings. However, its sensitivity towards electronic and steric parameters limits the reaction and stems the need for further development. Acrylamides have been one such left out of their sensitivity. Herein we report an IRC reaction, using acrylamide as a source of initial enolate. The cyclization has been achieved on a labile and challenging framework, prone to decomposition. Different control experiments have addressed the instability of the precursor. Protocol was further extendable to annulation for benzo analogs. We also report tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy3) as a stable, commercial, and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use nucleophilic catalyst in the field of IRC reactions as compared to earlier well&#8208;established trimethyl and tributyl phosphines. Me3P and Bu3P although useful, are sensitive, prone to oxidation, and need careful handling. The protocol leads to the synthesis of piperidone and dihydroquinolone frameworks. A quick study to test the feasibility of catalyzing the Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) reaction by PCy3 was also done successfully, although in moderate yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights Into the Magnesium&#8208;Catalyzed Catalyzed C&#8208;C Coupling of Terminal Alkynes with Carbodiimides.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bis&#8208;guanidinate anion stabilized amido magnesium (II) compound [LMgN(SiMe3)2; L = {(ArHN)(ArN)&#8208;C=N&#8722;C=(NAr)(NHAr); Ar = 2,6&#8208;Et2&#8208;C6H3}] (Mg&#8208;1) has been synthesized and characterized. It has been successfully employed as a pre&#8208;catalyst for the catalytic C&#8208;C coupling of terminal alkynes with carbodiimides, producing propiolamidine products with moderate to good yields. The active catalyst bis&#8208;guanidinate magnesium acetylide [LMgC&#8801;C&#8208;Ph]2 (Mg&#8208;2) and the intermediate magnesium propiolamidinate [LMg{(NiPr)2C}C&#8801;C&#8722;Ph] (Mg&#8208;3) involved in the catalytic reaction were isolated and thoroughly characterized through multinuclear NMR and mass spectral analyses, as well as single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Based on the above findings, a plausible mechanistic cycle has been proposed. Additionally, a new example of bis&#8208;guanidinate supported structurally characterized magnesium propiolamidate compound [LMg{(4&#8208;CH3&#8208;C6H4)N&#8208;(C&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8722;Ph)=O]2 (Mg&#8208;4) has been described via the reaction between Mg&#8208;2 and isocyanate.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An efficient synthesis of polychloroalkylated indolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines has been achieved via aryldiazonium salt induced radical cyclization reaction of N&#8208;methylallyl&#8208;2&#8208;arylindoles with polychloromethanes. In this reaction, neither metal catalyst nor additional oxidant was required, and an isoquinoline ring was constructed by tandem radical additions on the nonactivated carbon&#8722;carbon double bond of allyl group in 2&#8208;arylindoles. This protocol features advantages of wide substituent scope, environmentally friendly conditions and good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of the Pyoverdine Chromophore: Expanding the Toolbox for the Preparation of Pyoverdine Conjugates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pyoverdine chromophore is an important component of a family of siderophores which are secreted by the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa for iron absorption. In this study, an efficient and improved synthetic route to the chromophore structure is reported, beginning from readily available starting materials, D&#8208;glutamic acid and L&#8208;DOPA. This strategy has not only delivered the first synthesis of the free pyoverdine D chromophore, but also offers potential access to a wide range of other pyoverdine chromophore species.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of N&#8208;(2&#8208;SF5&#8208;ethyl)amides is described via an amidation reaction between 2&#8208;(pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanyl)acetic acid, the SF5&#8208;containing building block, and various amines. A total of 27 examples of SF5&#8208;containing amides were synthesized, with yields going from 43% to quantitative isolated yield. We showed that a N&#8208;(2&#8208;SF5&#8208;ethyl)amide could be converted to a N&#8208;(2&#8208;SF5&#8208;ethyl)amine and a SF5&#8208;containing oxadiazoles. Finally, the effect of the SF5 substituent on the lipophilicity of the amide of a model compound was evaluated.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential Aerial Oxidation And Atom&#8208;economical C&#8208;3 Chalcogenation Of Indolines Facilitated By Potassium Tert&#8208;butoxide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An operationally straightforward and highly efficient potassium tert&#8208;butoxide facilitated protocol for the C&#8208;3 chalcogenation of indolines under catalyst and additive&#8208;free conditions has been established under ambient temperature. The salient features of the process include the development of transition metal&#8208;free, oxidant&#8208;free and iodine&#8208;free, atom&#8208;economic and cost&#8208;effective reaction conditions at room temperature in DMSO as solvent for regioselective generation of 3&#8208;chalcogenyl indoles in high yields. The mechanistic interpretation through controlled experiments and analysis of intermediates suggests the prevalence of the ionic pathway. The reaction is scalable to gram&#8208;scale without a significant decrease in product yield, indicating its potential for large&#8208;scale applications. This protocol offers a practical and environment friendly approach to accessing a diverse range of 3&#8208;arylthioindoles and 3&#8208;arylselenylindoles withstanding electron releasing and withdrawing substituents in good to excellent yields. Interestingly, the biological evaluation of the 3&#8208;arylselenylindole products exhibited significant activity against breast cancer and triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cell lines MCF&#8208;7, and MDA&#8208;MB 231. These results indicate the derivatives to be potent candidates for further SAR study.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyst&#8208;Free Chiral Phosphoric Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Minisci&#8208;Type Alkylation of N&#8208;Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we present an efficient radical approach for the enantioselective Minisci&#8208;type alkylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes, using chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) as a catalyst under mild conditions, without the need for metals, photocatalysts, and other additives. Prochiral &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals generated from RAEs were successfully introduced to N&#8208;heteroarene derivatives, including&#160;pyridine, quinoline, and isoquinoline,&#160;resulting in a range of valuable chiral alkylated N&#8208;heteroarenes with secondary amines in high yields and good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98% ee). The chiral phosphoric acid catalyst not only activates the substrate and induces asymmetry but also facilitates essential electron transfer processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Cleavage of Alkoxyamines for Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoredox catalysis and synthetic electrochemistry have begun to find their spot in a synthetic chemist&#8217;s toolbox. Apart from its use of renewable reagents (light and electricity respectively), these methods have enabled pathways that were previously viewed as near impossible. It is therefore essential to develop methods to further advance the field of photoredox catalysis and synthetic electrochemistry. Alkoxyamines previously used for initiation of polymerization reactions are now viewed as prime building blocks for photoredox and synthetic electrochemists for their facile reactivity to oxidatively cleave C&#8208;O bonds. This review begins with addressing the first method developed for generating carbocations via a mesolytic cleavage pathway, and then highlights the recent approaches to utilizing photoredox and synthetic electrochemistry on oxidative cleavage of alkoxyamines for nucleophilic substitution reactions. To demonstrate its applicability, this review also highlights its utilization in the enantioselective synthesis of (&#8208;)&#8208;calycanthidine and (&#8208;)&#8208;psychotriasine.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation and Application of Sulfur Ylides in Light&#8208;Mediated Transformations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur ylides are essential reagents in various organic reactions like epoxidation and cyclopropanation. While traditionally employed in ionic chemistry, recent advancements in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysis reveal their potential as sources of radicals or free carbenes. The photochemical or photocatalytic generation of reactive intermediates using sulfur ylides expands the utility of these reagents in modern organic synthesis, offering sustainable solutions to emerging challenges. Despite early demonstrations in the 1960s, the past years have witnessed a surge in photochemical methods utilizing sulfur ylides as precursors. The use of redox&#8208;active photocatalysts has facilitated numerous radical reactions. This review consolidates key findings in sulfur ylide chemistry, particularly focusing on photo&#8208;mediated reactions, to stimulate further research interest in this dynamic field.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this study, the anion radical [2+2] photocycloaddition of aryl&#8208;enones was investigated under batch and flow conditions. The reaction was promoted by LiBr as a Lewis acid and catalyzed by Eosin Y under visible light irradiation. Symmetrical enones and asymmetrical unsaturated ketoesters were effectively cyclized to yield substituted bicyclo[3.2.0]heptanes in high yield and diastereoselectivity. Through the exploration of different experimental setups and reaction conditions, a precise control over the diastereoselectivity of the process was achieved, favoring the formation of either cis or trans substituted bicyclo[3.2.0]heptanes. In&#8208;flow experiments allowed to further improve the efficiency of the methodology, leading to higher productivity and space time yields.

         <title>A Formal General Method for the Synthesis of Spiroacetals: Easy Access to Oleocaran/Elmonin Core</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five [n,n]&#8208; and [m,n]&#8208;spiroacetals with five, six and seven membered rings were prepared by using a formal method from cheap starting materials and reagents and applying simple procedures. This method was further adapted for the synthesis of a more complex spiroacetal, namely the spiro[isobenzofuran&#8208;1,20&#8208;naphtho[1,8b,c]furan] skeleton of the enantiomeric couple oleocaran and elmonin, as an example demonstrating its potential.







Abstract
A general method for the synthesis of spiroacetals was investigated. Simple symmetrical [n,n]&#8208;spiroacetals (n=5,6) can be prepared from &#945;,&#969;&#8208;alkanediols by their conversion to the respective &#969;&#8208;benzyloxyalkyl bromides, addition of their Grignard reagents to ethyl formate, further oxidation of the resulting secondary alcohols and finally deprotection with spontaneous intramolecular acetalization. Access to the respective unsymmetrical [m,n]&#8208;spiroacetals (m,n=5,6,7) was similarly achieved by addition of the above Grignard reagent to a &#969;&#8208;benzyloxyalkanal, followed by the same reaction sequence. This method was further adapted for the synthesis of the unsubstituted structural core of natural spiroacetals oleocaran and elmonin, thus demonstrating its potential.

         <title>Catalytic Activity of Mono&#8208;and Bimetallic Rhodium(I) and Iridium(I) Complexes Bearing Carbon&#8208;Ether&#8208;Carbon (COC) Ligand for the Intramolecular Cyclization of 4&#8208;Pentynoic Acid</title>

         <dc:description>
The catalytic activity of a set of mono&#8208; and bimetallic Rh(I) and Ir(I) complexes featuring carbene&#8208;linker&#8208;carbene (COC) bis&#8208;triazolylidene ligands coordinated in a bridging or chelating fashion was assessed in the cyclization of 4&#8208;pentynoic acid.







Abstract
The catalytic performance of a series of mono&#8208; and bimetallic Ir(I) and Rh(I) complexes bearing the (COC) bis&#8208;triazolylidene ligand, coordinated in a bridging or chelating fashion, was evaluated in the cyclization of 4&#8208;pentynoic acid. The chelated mononuclear cationic complex [Ir(cod)(COC)]PF6 (cod=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene; COC=biscarbene ether) displayed the highest reaction rate for 4&#8208;pentynoic acid to form &#947;&#8208;methyl&#8208;ene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone (5&#8208;methylenedihydrofuran&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;one). Density Functional Theory calculations were carried out to rationalize the reaction mechanism which proceeds in three steps, namely coordination of the alkyne to the active catalyst followed by intramolecular cyclization and final reductive elimination. Its catalytic performance was further assessed against different substituted 4&#8208;pentynoic acid derivatives.

Density Functional Theory calculations were carried out to rationalize the reaction mechanism which proceeds in three steps, namely coordination of the alkyne to the active catalyst followed by intramolecular cyclization and final reductive elimination. Its catalytic performance was further assessed against different substituted 4-pentynoic acid derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harnessing Oxoammonium Salts for Oxidations in Organic Synthesis and Catalysis: Origins and Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxoammonium cation has been identified as the true oxidant intermediate in many aerobic oxidations promoted by long&#8208;lived nitroxide radicals. Various oxoammonium salts have been synthesized and utilized to perform these oxidation reactions. In addition to alcohol dehydrogenation and oxidative coupling reactions, new types of reactions involving oxoammonium salts have recently been reported. This concept aims to discuss these oxidations from the perspective of reaction mechanisms, with a focus on progress made since 2019. Beyond the electron transfer route for synthesizing oxoammonium salts, four types of reaction mechanisms are included.</dc:description>

         <title>Merging New and Old Concepts: Tandem Oxidative Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover Ritter Amidation via Multicomponent Photo&#8208; and Electrochemical Processes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen&#8208;containing drug molecules and pharmaceuticals are ubiquitous, rendering the construction of C&#8211;N bonds a crucial target in methodology development. The Ritter reaction is a well&#8208;established method for accessing C&#8211;N bonds by generating amide functionality through the reaction of carbocations and nitriles. Since its discovery back in 1948, the Ritter reaction has progressively advanced towards milder and more sustainable conditions for carbocation generation. In this regard, notable contributions have been made by means of single electron transfer (SET) chemistry. Nowadays, photo&#8208; and electrochemistry are established methods of choice for the generation of reactive radical intermediates and their subsequent oxidation via radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPC) mechanism. We review recent examples of tandem RPC and Ritter&#8208;type protocols, demonstrating how photo&#8208; and electrochemical energies have been effectively harvested to expand the precursor pool for the Ritter reaction and also reimagine the process with novel mechanisms and additives.</dc:description>

         <title>Trivalent Heteroglycoclusters as Focal Point Pseudoenantiomers: Synthesis and Preliminary Biological Evaluation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis of the first heteroglycoclusters featuring three distinct carbohydrate ligands. The obtained pair of stereoisomeric glycoclusters were named &#8220;focal point enantiomers&#8221;, as the configuration of the focal point is the only varying stereogenic element in these molecules. The first pair of such diastereomeric heteroglycoclusters was accessible by an efficient sequence of protection and sequential glycosylation steps utilizing a mannosyl, a N&#8208;acetylglucosaminyl, and a galactosyl donor, respectively, which was applied to a prototype azido&#8208;functionalized tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS) scaffold molecule. The stereoisomers could be distinguished based on an X&#8208;ray structure of one of the isomeric key intermediates. As previously shown with divalent counterparts, such heterotrivalent cluster glycosides are useful tools for studying the fine&#8208;tuning of carbohydrate recognition. The azido functional group at the focal point of the synthetic scaffold molecule was employed in a conjugation reaction with a linker for further immobilization on a gold surface in order to fabricate glyco&#8208;SAMs (self&#8208;assembled monolayers). A preliminary biological evaluation of the focal point enantiomers was performed in solution using the well&#8208;known model lectin Concanavalin A and the important bacterial lectin FimH.</dc:description>

         <title>Methanol&#8208;mediated One&#8208;pot Transformation of Benzonitriles to Five and Six&#8208;Membered Heterocycles: Synthesis and Mechanistic Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we describe a facile methodology for the synthesis of heterocyclic molecules such as 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted imidazolines, oxazolines and 1,4,5,6&#8208;tetrahydropyrimidines, under one&#8208;pot and metal&#8208;free conditions. A series of electron&#8208;poor substituted benzonitriles were used as starting materials with different available diamines and amino alcohols, producing the desired products in good to high yields within methanol and in the absence of catalyst or additives. This methodology can be easily scaled up to laboratory size of 3 mmol for both five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered heterocycles. Detailed mechanistic and theoretical studies supported the dual role of methanolic media as solvent and as mediated agent. To shed light on the reaction mechanism, DFT mechanistic studies suggest a distinction in the first step, with the activation of the nitrile by methanol, and the formation of a benzimidamide and/or a benzimidate (observed by NMR) as intermediates. This facile synthetic procedure provides a green, metal&#8208;free, and mild protocol for the synthesis of a series of imidazoline, oxazoline and tetrahydropyrimidine derivatives</dc:description>

         <title>Phenyl Substituted Cyclo(meta)polyphenylenes: One More Step Towards the Total Synthesis of Diameter&#8208;Controlled Zig&#8208;Zag Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new zigzag&#8208;type single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) short segments were synthesized. The synthesis relies on the use of calixarenes as templates to pre&#8208;organize the reactive groups. The organization/orientation of the aromatic units is designed to enable intramolecular photocyclizations, a first step towards the total synthesis of SWCNTs.







Abstract
The calixarene&#8208;templated synthesis of new cyclo(meta&#8208; polyphenylenes (CMPs) is described. These compounds are functionalized with added aromatic units, that are suitably oriented for oxidative aromatization to be envisioned. This could pave the way towards the synthesis of elongated segments of zigzag&#8208;type single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs).

         <title>Computational Insights into Cinchona&#8208;Based Phase Transfer Catalysis for Asymmetric Conjugate Cyanation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational insights into the conjugate cyanation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones using quinine&#8208;derived phase transfer catalysts are presented. The study examines different binding modes, reaction mechanisms, and non&#8208;covalent interactions, demonstrating how catalyst modifications enhance enantioselectivity and invert product configuration.







Abstract
The synthesis of asymmetric organic molecules has experienced a huge development over the last few decades. Phase&#8208;transfer catalysis has been proven to be one of the most powerful methods for these asymmetric transformations. However, the study of the mechanism of these catalysts and the different interactions that they can establish with the reactants has failed to keep pace. In the present study, the conjugate cyanation of two different &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones are studied in the presence of a well&#8208;known alkaloid quinine&#8208;derived PTC, along with different modifications. The study includes the comparison of different binding modes between the catalysts and the different reactants, the mechanistic study of the reaction and the analysis of the non&#8208;covalent interactions established within the complexes and their role in the global enantioselectivity of the process.

         <title>Saturated Heterocyclic Sulfamoyl Fluorides: Building Blocks for the SuFEx Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable and cost&#8208;effective procedure for the direct fluorosulfonylation of saturated (hetero)cyclic and functionalized amines using SO2F2 in basic media is reported. The obtained sp3&#8208;enriched sulfamoyl fluorides can be considered a new generation of building blocks for SuFEx chemistry: they participated in transformations tolerating the SO2F functionality and reactions at the sulfur atom with O&#8208;, N&#8208;, and C&#8208;nucleophiles.







Abstract
A scalable protocol for direct SO2F2&#8208;based fluorosulfonylation of saturated (hetero)cyclic and functionalized amines is reported. The method is cost&#8208;effective and applicable for multigram preparation of structurally diverse compounds, as illustrated by the synthesis of 58 building blocks decorated with common functional groups. A comparison of overall yields of products demonstrates the advantages of the present method over alternative approaches. The obtained functionalized sp3&#8208;enriched sulfamoyl fluorides can be considered a new generation of building blocks for SuFEx (sulfur fluoride exchange) chemistry. The synthetic utility of the synthesized building blocks was demonstrated by late&#8208;stage reactions tolerating the SO2F functionality as well as transformations to provide the corresponding sulfamide, sulfamate, and sulfonamide derivatives.

         <title>Carbonyl&#8208;Alkyne Metathesis Reactions Catalyzed by Organic Halogen&#8208;Bond Donors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple method for a halogen&#8208;bond catalyzed carbonyl&#8208;alkyne metathesis with good yields and broad functional group tolerance has been developed. The bidentate halogen&#8208;bond donor shows a high catalytic activity for both the intra&#8208; and intermolecular reaction and mechanistic investigations support the hypothesis of halogen&#8208;bond catalysis.







Abstract
The carbonyl&#8208;alkyne metathesis reaction is a powerful method for the synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls. We now report on the development of a halogen&#8208;bond catalyzed protocol for both the intra&#8208; and intermolecular reaction. Our studies revealed that methanol is a highly efficient solvent and that a very broad range of functional groups are tolerated under the reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies support the proposed halogen&#8208;bond interaction. Furthermore, the halogen&#8208;bond protocol is compared with other available catalytic systems for these reactions.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the use of an air&#8208;stable iridium pyrazolato complex as an effective catalyst for the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones and arylacetonitriles with primary alcohols, employing borrowing hydrogen strategy. The alkylation reactions were efficiently conducted at 120 &#176;C in toluene utilizing a very low catalyst loading (0.1 mol%). A broad range of ketones and arylacetonitriles, in combination with various aromatic and aliphatic primary alcohols, were successfully transformed into the corresponding &#945;&#8208;alkylated products. Additionally, quinoline derivatives were synthesized from 2&#8208;aminobenzylalcohol and ketones using dehydrogenative coupling strategy. A mechanistic investigation unveiled that the key step involved alcohol activation via metal&#8208;ligand cooperation.</dc:description>

         <title>S&#8208;Aryl substitution enhances acidity of the 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium scaffold in asymmetric organocatalysis results in remarkable rate accelerations, with reactions typically occurring via N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) intermediates. Although the most acidic NHC pre&#8208;catalyst class, there remains scope for further increases in acidity particularly for aqueous organocatalysis applications. The acidity&#8208;enhancing effects of thio&#8208;substituents on carbon acidity are well&#8208;documented but not explored in the 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium scaffold. Herein, we report the synthesis of a large series of N, N&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;C(3)&#8208;S&#8208;aryltriazolium ions and quantitative kinetic evaluation of C(5)&#8208;H acidity. The direct attachment of S&#8208;aryl substituents to the triazolium heterocycle results in substantial increases in protofugalities (kinetic acidities) with second order rate constants (kDO) for C(5)&#8208;H deprotonation by DO&#8722; base that are 2.9&#8208;60.3 fold higher than for reference 1,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolium iodide in D2O solution. Protofugalities for the N, N&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;C(3)&#8208;S&#8208;aryltriazolium series are similar to commonly used bicyclic N&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolium organocatalysts despite having two electron donating N&#8208;alkyl substituents. This highlights the future potential of this NHC design which could enable the introduction of two chiral alkyl substituents close to the C(5) carbenic position with pre&#8208;catalyst acidity controlled by distal C(3)&#8208;S&#8208;aryl substitution. Detailed X&#8208;ray structural data&#8208;protofugality correlations enabled evaluation of the S&#8208;aryl substituent effect origins. C(5)&#8208;H pKa values (16.9&#8208;18.6) were calculated by utilisation of experimental protofugalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Introduction of Perfluoroacyl (&#8208;CORF) Groups into Organic Substrates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct addition of perfluoroacyl (&#8208;CORF) groups to organic frameworks has seen a resurgence in interest due to the benefits of these groups in late&#8208;stage modification of pro&#8208;drugs and biologically active compounds, helping to identify new active leads. The presence of &#8208;CORF groups positively impacts the structure&#8208;activity relationships of these compounds. In that sense, both polar methods and radical catalytic protocols have been developed for the direct syntheses of trifluoromethyl and perfluoroalkyl ketones. In particular, methodologies to tame the unstable trifluoroacyl radical, which could be a key intermediate in the late&#8208;stage syntheses of trifluoroacyl&#8208;substituted compounds, has allowed much progress in this area. In the next sections, the direct incorporation of perfluoroacyl groups into (hetero)aromatic compounds, &#8208;CORF substitutions at Csp3&#8208;H, alkyl halides, alkenes, amides, and N&#8208;atoms will be discussed in detail, suggesting the future directions and perspectives in the field. These known reactions are summarized in Table 1.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Regioselective Selenohydroxylation of Enamine Amides with Diaryl Diselenides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports the selective oxyselenization and selective double bond cleavage reactions of enamide and diaryldiselenide under visible light irradiation, and develops an effective method for synthesizing &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;selenide. Oxygen in the air participates in the reaction, avoiding the addition of environmentally unfriendly photocatalysts and oxidants.







Abstract
This article reports the synthesis of alpha&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;beta&#8208;seleno amides containing intramolecular hydrogen bonds by selective oxyselenization and selective double bond cleavage reactions of enamine amides with diaryl diselenides under visible light irradiation. This protocol proceeds well to provide the 30 desired products with yields of 37&#8201;%&#8211;80&#8201;% using the 12&#8197;W blue LED as light source under room temperature conditions. Moreover, diaryl diselenides plays a dual role as a substrate and a photoactive reagent, as well as oxygen in the air participates in the reaction, thus avoiding the extra addition of environmentally unfriendly photoctalysts and oxidants.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article reports the synthesis of alpha-hydroxy-beta-seleno amides containing intramolecular hydrogen bonds by selective oxyselenization and selective double bond cleavage reactions of enamine amides with diaryl diselenides under visible light irradiation. This protocol proceeds well to provide the 30 desired products with yields of 37&#8201;%&#8211;80&#8201;% using the 12&#8197;W blue LED as light source under room temperature conditions. Moreover, diaryl diselenides plays a dual role as a substrate and a photoactive reagent, as well as oxygen in the air participates in the reaction, thus avoiding the extra addition of environmentally unfriendly photoctalysts and oxidants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Expanding 1&#8208;Aminosugar Synthesis through Activated Glycals&#8217; Reactivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and efficient protocol for the synthesis of 1&#8208;aminosugars under mild reaction conditions has been developed. This method utilizes activated glycals as substrates and successfully achieves the Ferrier&#8208;type reaction in the presence of various alkyl amines to lead to 1&#8208;aminoglycosides in good yields and good to excellent &#946;&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
Glycal family offers an interesting platform whose reactivity let the possibility to reach diverse glycoanalogues. In particular, the Ferrier rearrangement allows the introduction of diverse nucleophiles on the anomeric position but stays limited with regard to the nitrogen&#8208;containing nucleophiles, which can be possibly used with success. Herein, we utilize peracetylated C2&#8208;substituted glycal substrates to achieve Ferrier&#8208;type 1&#8208;aminoglycoside compounds under activator&#8208;free conditions, resulting in moderate to good yields and good to excellent &#946;&#8208;selectivity. Various secondary amines have been successfully employed. We explored the influence of C2&#8208;substitution (electron&#8208;withdrawing character) and glycal configuration, synthesizing 20 different 1&#8208;aminoglycosides through this method.

         <title>A direct visible&#8208;light mediated coupling of azaarenes with diversely functionalized alkyl carbons via organophotocatalytic sp3C&#8208;H bond activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Substituted azaarenes are one of the most ubiquitous moieties in natural products and drug molecules. An efficient organophotocatalytic method for direct coupling of diverse cyclic and acyclic alkyl carbons of alcohols, ethers, alkyl halides and alkanes with different azaaryl systems has been developed. It uses low loading of easily synthesizable efficient acridinium based photocatalyst and blue LED to generate highly reactive radicals on saturated hydrocarbons through sequential single electron transfer (SET) and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process. These in situ generated nucleophilic carbon radicals then undergo instantaneous regio&#8208;selective coupling with azaarenes through Minisci type coupling to generate an array of important pharmacophores through sp2C&#8208;sp3C bond formation. With inexpensive organophotocatalysts, higher yield and wide substrate scope, this method provides a greener, efficient and versatile alternative to the previously reported syntheses.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrazone Based pH&#8208;Responsive Configurational Molecular Rotary Switches Containing a New Conjugated &#960;&#8208;Electronic Framework</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A pyrido&#8208;pyrimidinone heterocycle derived pH&#8208;activated, hydrazone based molecular switch and its switching mechanism are reported here. The introduction of a new conjugated p electronic framework (enone part in the molecule) allowed the system to undergo hydrazone&#8208;azo tautomerization , followed by E&#8208;Z isomerization through rotation around the partial C&#8208;N single bond. Under acidic pH, protonation took place selectively on pyrimidinone nitrogen, and that turned the molecule to the corresponding Z&#8208;H+ configuration. On the other hand, addition of triethylamine in the same solution reverted the molecule back to its original E&#8208;configuration. Extensive proton&#8208;NMR, and detailed X&#8208;ray crystallography coupled with UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy were carried out to establish the switching phenomena. Theoretical DFT calculations leading to free energy diagrams, transition states, and intermediates shed light on the mechanism behind the switching phenomenon.</dc:description>

         <title>FeCl3 Catalyzed Synthesis of cis&#8208;Fused Reduced THC Analogues</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
FeCl3 catalyzes the isomerization of 2&#8208;prenylated&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrans towards cis&#8208;fused tetrahydro&#8208;6H&#8208;benzo[c]chromene systems (cis&#8208;THC analogues). The same catalyst promotes the formation of these products via cyclocondensation of 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl substrates and citral/farnesal&#8208;type aldehydes. The synthetic strategy could be applied to the racemic preparation of biologically relevant natural products cis&#8208;perrottetinene and &#916;9&#8208;cis&#8208;tetrahydrocannabiorcol.







Abstract
Studies on a cycloisomerization reaction of 2&#8208;prenylated&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrans towards cis&#8208;fused tetrahydro&#8208;6H&#8208;benzo[c]chromene systems (reduced cis&#8208;THC analogues) are reported. The transformation is catalyzed by iron chloride and proceeds with the formation of two new bonds and two stereocenters diastereoselectively. The same catalyst also promotes the formation of these products via a one&#8208;pot tandem Knoevenagel condensation of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexanediones and citral or farnesal aldehydes, followed by cycloisomerization establishing a direct assembly of this important scaffold.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure and Properties of Core&#8208;Modified Calixporphyrinoids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis, structure, coordination, spectroscopic properties and applications of core&#8208;modified calix(n)phyrins that are resulted by replacing one or more pyrrole rings of calix(n)phyrins with different heterocycles such as thiophene, selenophene, tellurophene, phosphole, silole and so on and carbacycles such as m&#8208;/p&#8208;phenylene rings are described in this review.







Abstract
Calix[n]porphyrinoids containing both sp2 and sp3 meso&#8208;carbons can bind metals like porphyrinoids and anions like calix[n]pyrroles. Thus, calix[n]porphyrinoids are hybrid macrocycles of porphyrinoids and calix[n]pyrroles. The core&#8208;modified calix[n]porphyrinoids resulted by replacing one or more pyrroles of calix[n]porphyrinoids with different heterocycles or carbacycles that possesses very attractive structural, spectral, and coordination properties. For the past two decades, several different types of core&#8208;modified calix[n]porphyrinoids in which one or more pyrroles were replaced with other heterocycles such as thiophene, selenophene, tellurophene, silole, phosphole, pyridine, etc and carbacycles such as m/p&#8208;phenylene have been synthesized and explored their structure, metal coordination and anion sensing properties. This review describes different synthetic strategies used for the synthesis of various types of core&#8208;modified calix[4]phyrins and expanded calix[n]phyrins and discusses their key structural aspects, properties, coordination chemistry and applications.

&lt;p&gt;Synthesis, structure, coordination, spectroscopic properties and applications of core-modified calix(n)phyrins that are resulted by replacing one or more pyrrole rings of calix(n)phyrins with different heterocycles such as thiophene, selenophene, tellurophene, phosphole, silole and so on and carbacycles such as &lt;i&gt;m-/p&lt;/i&gt;-phenylene rings are described in this review.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calix[n]porphyrinoids containing both sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-carbons can bind metals like porphyrinoids and anions like calix[n]pyrroles. Thus, calix[n]porphyrinoids are hybrid macrocycles of porphyrinoids and calix[n]pyrroles. The core-modified calix[n]porphyrinoids resulted by replacing one or more pyrroles of calix[n]porphyrinoids with different heterocycles or carbacycles that possesses very attractive structural, spectral, and coordination properties. For the past two decades, several different types of core-modified calix[n]porphyrinoids in which one or more pyrroles were replaced with other heterocycles such as thiophene, selenophene, tellurophene, silole, phosphole, pyridine, etc and carbacycles such as &lt;i&gt;m/p&lt;/i&gt;-phenylene have been synthesized and explored their structure, metal coordination and anion sensing properties. This review describes different synthetic strategies used for the synthesis of various types of core-modified calix[4]phyrins and expanded calix[n]phyrins and discusses their key structural aspects, properties, coordination chemistry and applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Expanding the Scope of Chemoselective Reductive Cyclization: Synthesis of Unsubstituted 9H&#8208;Thioxanthenes and 10&#8208;Methyl 9,10&#8208;Dihydroacridines and Beyond</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unsubstituted 9H&#8208;thioxanthenes are obtained from 2&#8208;(arylthio)benzaldehydes via In(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective reductive cyclization in diisopropyl ether at elevated temperature. The reaction possesses broad substrate scope, good functional group compatibility and proceeds via chemoselective reduction of thioxanthylium ion in the presence of a highly reactive arylaldehyde. Similarly, unsubstituted 10&#8208;methyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridines are also obtained via a Bronsted acid catalyzed chemoselective reductive cyclization of 2&#8208;(methylphenylamino)benzaldehydes in isopropanol (solvent). The reductive cyclization method can also be utilized for the synthesis of 9&#8208;trifluormethyl containing (thio)xanthenes. Mono&#8208;deuterated 9H&#8208;thioxanthene is obtained in moderate yield in deuterated solvent (THF&#8208;d8).</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Aryl Azide&#8208; and Triazole&#8208;Based Unnatural Amino Acid Motifs via the Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8208;H Arylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper reports a method for the synthesis of examples of aryl azide&#8208; and triazole moiety&#8208;based unnatural amino acid motifs using the Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed arylation of the prochiral C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds of carboxamides of amino acids as one of the key transformations. Synthesis of racemic and enantioenriched aryl azide&#8208;based unnatural amino acid motifs including, norvaline, leucine, norleucine, phenylalanine, 2&#8208;aminobutyric acid, 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid, and non&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives were shown. Additionally, we attempted the synthesis of triazole moiety&#8208;installed norvaline, leucine, norleucine, phenylalanine, 2&#8208;aminobutyric acid, 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid, and non&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives via the Cu&#8208;catalyzed Click reaction. We also demonstrated the removal of the protecting groups and the synthesis of free amino group&#8208;containing aryl azide&#8208; or triazole&#8208;based unnatural amino acid motifs and peptides. Generally, azide moiety&#8208;containing unnatural amino acid motifs are important molecular tools in chemical biology. Furthermore, aryl azide&#8208; and triazole moiety&#8208;containing unnatural amino acid scaffolds are notable substrates in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery research. Accordingly, this work contributes to enriching the library of aryl azide&#8208; and triazole&#8208;based unnatural amino acid derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208; and Electrochemical Modification of Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins through Cysteine: Recent Advances and Future Perspective</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical modification of peptides and proteins has emerged as an efficient strategy to study and manipulate the physical and chemical properties and biological functionalities of proteins. Among the 20 proteinogenic amino acids, cysteine is one of the most frequently targeted residues for chemical modification of peptides and proteins due to its unique thiol group and its relatively low natural abundance. Cysteine is able to partake in radical and atom&#8208;, electron&#8208; and hydride&#8208;transfer reactions taking the benefit of redox activity of thiol side chain. Recently, photo&#8208; and electrochemistry have emerged as influential methodologies for enabling novel transformations in organic synthesis. These two fields both involve the generation of radical intermediates through single electron transfer processes, which align&#160; with the redox activity of cysteine residue. Furthermore, the mild and controllable features are suitable for solving the chemo&#8208; and regioselective problems of the existing bioconjugation strategies. Given the intrinsic benefits of photo&#8208; and electrochemisry, the application of developing novel cysteine&#8208;based bioconjugation methods is increasingly compelling. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in photo&#8208; and electrochemical approaches for modifying cysteine&#8208;containing peptides and proteins. The advantages of photo&#8208; and electrochemical redox catalysis and its applicability in developing novel biocompatible methods are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrooxidative Thiocyanation of Hydroxy&#8208; and Alkoxybenzenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We developed an original method for thiocyanation of hydroxy&#8208; and alkoxy&#8208;substituted benzenes (including naturally occurring compounds) using electrogenerated thiocyanogen, (SCN)&#8322;. The presence of zinc chloride as a Lewis acid significantly enhances reaction efficiency by activating thiocyanogen. Cyclic voltammetry of the reactants and their combinations was employed to optimize reaction conditions and investigate the proposed mechanisms. This method demonstrated broad synthetic utility, leading to mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;thiocyanated arenes and various heterocycles with yields 36&#8211;97%. Notable products include the neuroprotective drug riluzole and precursors for the antiprotozoal drugs toltrazuril and ponazuril.</dc:description>

         <title>Vicinal Difunctionalization of Unactivated Alkenes Through Radical Addition/Remote (Hetero)Aryl Migration Cascade</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkenes are ubiquitous in natural and synthetic molecules and constitute versatile building blocks. Remarkably, their radical 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization offers a valuable synthetic tool for rapidly accessing multifunctional compounds through a step and atom&#8208; economy process. More particularly, the addition of (hetero)aromatic groups onto alkenes is of particular appeal given the numerous applications of aromatic compounds in various fields. However, such process becomes difficult when attempted on simple non&#8208;conjugated aliphatic alkenes (unactivated alkenes). In this context, the (hetero)arylation of unactivated alkenes through the radical functionalization followed by remote (hetero)aryl migration has recently emerged as a powerful opportunity to address the lack of reactivity of such &#960; systems. The advances in radical chemistry have led to a flood of synthetic methods to trigger the addition of a carbon&#8208; or heteroatom&#8208;centered radical/(hetero)aryl migration sequence. Interestingly, the migration of the aromatic ring can take place from various atoms. This feature has spurred the design of several substrates allowing such a process to occur. This review intends to provide an overview of the contributions according to the type of substrates that have been employed. The reaction scope, limitations and mechanistic aspects will be discussed with the aim of stimulating efforts in this research area.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient synthesis of 2&#8208;arylpropionitriles via selective monomethylation of aryl acetonitriles using an easy to handle methylation agent</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A convenient and safe methylation protocol employing quaternary ammonium salts (PhMe3NI) as alternative methylating agents for the selective &#945;&#8208;methylation of arylacetonitriles is presented. This approach allows for the selective &#945;&#8208;methylation of arylacetonitriles, overcoming the limitations of existing techniques, while offering a practical and sustainable solution for late&#8208;stage functionalization in medicinal chemistry. The straightforward and safe nature of this methodology makes it particularly well&#8208;suited for applications in drug discovery. In our report, we present a diverse set of 18 examples, achieving yields of up to 76 %.</dc:description>

         <title>Room Temperature Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Ullmann Reaction of (Hetero)aryl/Vinyl Chlorides Enabled by Silylchloride&#8208;Activated Mn Powders</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pre&#8208;activation of Mn powers by trimethylsilylchloride (TMSCl) enables a highly efficient Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive homocoupling of (hetero)aryl/vinyl chlorides in DMA at room temperature to afford symmetrical biaryls/dienes in good to excellent yields although TMSCl plays a double&#8208;face role, activating Mn but deactivating Ni catalyst.







Abstract
A room temperature Ni&#8208;catalyzed Mn&#8208;mediated homocoupling of (hetero)aryl and vinyl chlorides using Mn powders pre&#8208;activated by trimethylsilylchloride (TMSCl) in DMA is reported. Large steric effects were observed while electronic influences from aryl chlorides proved to be rather small. High regioselectivity could be achieved between ortho&#8208;Cl and para&#8208;Cl/Br of aryl halides benefiting from the large steric effects. A double&#8208;face role of TMSCl, i.&#8201;e. activation of Mn powders but deactivation of nickel catalyst, was observed although TMSCl&#8208;activated Mn powders appeared to be the privileged metallic reductant. Applications of the protocol have been demonstrated in a multigram synthesis of Daclatasvir.

         <title>Improving Zonisamide Manufacturing: Insights into Stereochemistry and Mechanisms for Continuous Optimization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zonisamide, an important anti&#8208;epileptic drug, was prepared with a new and convenient synthesis. This process involves the preparation of a key hydroxyiminosultone intermediate, whose stereochemistry was characterized by powder XRD, and a rearrangement reaction, whose mechanism was investigated with a combination of techniques (NMR, HRMS and kinetic profiles).







Abstract
Zonisamide is a heterocyclic sulfonamide widely employed as anticonvulsant. In this work, we report an efficient process for the preparation of zonisamide, obtained in a six&#8208;step synthesis from phenyl salicylate with an overall 31&#8201;% yield. The key step is represented by a base&#8208;promoted intramolecular rearrangement of a &#946;&#8208;ketosultone oxime, leading to the concomitant formation of the benzisoxazole ring and of the exocyclic sulfonic group. This intriguing transformation is investigated with a combination of analytical techniques (NMR, HRMS, PXRD), leading to a preliminary mechanistic proposal.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Helicenes from Centrally Chiral Precursors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a systematic overview of the asymmetric synthesis of helicenes from centrally chiral precursors via central&#8208;to&#8208;helical chiral conversion or transfer strategies. It covers a broad spectrum of reactions, including Fischer indolization, Povarov reaction, Michael reaction, [3+2] and [2+2+2] cycloadditions, showcasing the versatility of these approaches in constructing enantioenriched helicenes.







Abstract
Chiral helicenes are widely used in fields related to organic materials and molecular machines relevant molecules, as well as serving as privileged frameworks for chiral ligands and catalysts. Therefore, the research into asymmetric routes for the synthesis of chiral helical compounds has garnered significant interest in recent years. In this regard, chirality conversion/transfer from chiral precursors has emerged as a powerful strategy for the construction of chiral helicenes, allowing the synthesis of various types of chiral helical compounds. This strategy has become and will remain a prominent research topic in the field of asymmetric synthesis. In this review article, described between 2012 and 2024, the approaches for the synthesis of chiral helicenes by chirality conversion or transfer from centrally chiral precursors are summarized.

         <title>Synthesis of Enamides through Hydro&#8208;Functionalization of Ynamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of functionalized enamides as versatile synthetic intermediates reflects the constant strive and creativity in the design and execution of synthetic methods and contemporary interest in the exploration of ynamide chemistry. In this review, important developments in the hydrofunctionalization of ynamides toward the formation of functionalized enamides have been highlighted.







Abstract
Most of the methods for the synthesis of functionalized enamides from ynamides were developed in the last two decades showing the contemporary interest in the exploration of ynamide chemistry. The utilization of the intrinsic reactivity of the ynamide triple bond through keteniminium intermediacy, coordination with metals, and as a radical acceptor toward the development of strategies for the synthesis of functionalized enamides reflect the constant strive and creativity in the design and execution of synthetic methods. The present review summarizes the synthetic strategies developed during the last two decades and is divided into the sections depending on the type of hydrofunctionalization reaction. It may be predicted that this field of chemistry will continue to grow exponentially in the coming years and the ready availability of a wide range of ynamides now provides an excellent opportunity to further enrich mainstream synthetic methodologies.

         <title>Next&#8208;Generation Time&#8208;Resolved Electron Paramagnetic Resonance for Direct Visualizing Mechanisms in Radical Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical chemistry is an important research field that plays a vital role in life science, material science, and energy conversions. However, directly visualizing the transient open&#8208;shell intermediates unambiguously in radical chemistry is a significant and long&#8208;standing challenge. Recently, we have developed an innovative ultrawide single&#8208;sideband phase&#8208;sensitive detection (U&#8208;PSD) time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) technique, which enables the characterization of diverse transient radical intermediates and mechanistic studies close to reaction conditions. In this brief review, we will offer an outline of the principles underlying our U&#8208;PSD TREPR technique, and present examples highlighting the technique's ability to accurately characterize and track free radical intermediates in photocatalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrogenative Coupling of Aryldiazonium Salts with Terminal Alkynes for the Assembly of Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An eco&#8208;friendly NHC&#8208;palladium&#8208;catalyzed denitrogenative coupling of aryldiazonium salts with terminal alkynes in basic ionic liquid for the assembly of structurally diverse internal alkynes is accomplished. The basic ionic liquid [C3NH2mim]Br is crucial for this catalytic transformation. In the presence of 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of IMes&#8208;Pd&#8208;Im&#8208;Cl2 in [C3NH2mim]Br, both the terminal alkynes and aryldiazonium salt were well tolerated, thus giving the desired internal alkynes in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
An N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene palladium (NHC&#8208;palladium)&#8208;catalyzed denitrogenative coupling of aryldiazonium salts with terminal alkynes in ionic liquids has been accomplished. This catalytic strategy provides an effective and green synthetic protocol for the assembly of structurally diverse internal alkynes with excellent functional group compatibility and mild conditions. In the presence of 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of IMes&#8208;Pd&#8208;Im&#8208;Cl2 as the catalyst, a wide range of terminal alkynes and aryldiazonium salts could be excellently tolerated. Basic ionic liquid plays a crucial role in this catalytic system, which not only acts as the green solvent, but also provides basic environment for the carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation process. Notably, this catalytic system could be recycled up to six times and reused without significant loss of catalytic activity.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Seven&#8208;Membered Lactams: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioenriched seven&#8208;membered lactams represent an important structural motif and present in a wide range of biologically active compounds and drugs. Significant progress has been achieved in this domain more recently. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral seven&#8208;membered lactams.







Abstract
The optically active lactams represent an important structural motif and present in a wide range of natural products, biologically active compounds and drugs. Compared to the synthesis of chiral five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered lactams, the asymmetric construction of seven&#8208;membered lactams often presents a challenge due to their consequential entropic and enthalpic barriers. Over the past few decades, substantial efforts have been devoted to this field and chemists have developed various efficient strategies for the preparation of seven&#8208;membered lactams. In this review, we will highlight the recent advances in enantioselective formation of seven&#8208;membered lactams and the discussion will be logically divided into three parts according to the reaction mode. The aim of this review is to familiarize the Reader with new synthetic opportunities offered by these interesting methodologies.

         <title>Conformational and Electron Density Analysis of Bicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes: All Roads Lead to Boats</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stability of boat&#8208;like conformers in bicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes has been studied through mapping potential energy surface analysis employing DFT computational methods. Also, the effects of oxygen, sulfur, and selenium heteroatoms on the conformational equilibrium have been analyzed employing the natural bond orbital (NBO) method. Finally, the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) approach pinpoints key atoms in the conformer stability.







Abstract
In view of the existence of an optimal conformation for molecular recognition and bearing in mind that nucleosides exhibit a broad range of pharmaceutical properties, whereby their conformation has a key role in molecular recognition, the tendency of the pseudosugar moiety in carbanucleosides to adopt a boat&#8208;like conformation has been studied on the basis of a bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane system, resulting in versatile drug&#8208;like scaffolds to increase molecular recognition. It is already known that using this system as pseudosugar can fix the conformation in the Northern or Southern geometry, required for biological activity, according to the relative position of the three&#8208;member cycle. By mapping their energy potential surface, we investigate the preference for boat&#8208;like conformers in bicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes. DFT is utilized alongside NBO analysis to explore the enhanced stability of boat&#8208;like conformers, also considering the influence of oxygen, sulfur, and selenium heteroatoms. Additionally, charge density distribution analysis using QTAIM identifie key atoms contributing to stability changes. These findings will help to comprehend this behavior in the drug discovery process when conformationally restricted nucleosides are involved.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of racemic oxacalix[4]arenes exhibiting planar chirality and a mesomer with a symmetric plane were conveniently synthesized and separated via dynamic SNAr reaction in 20&#8201;% and 49&#8201;% yields, respectively. The racemic mixture could be further resolved using HPLC on a chiral column. The products interconverted in the presence of CsF as a catalyst.







Abstract
A pair of racemic oxacalix[4]arenes featuring planar chirality and a mesomer with a symmetric plane were conveniently synthesized under mild conditions via a one&#8208;pot dynamic SNAr reaction and separated in 20&#8201;% and 49&#8201;% yields, respectively. X&#8208;ray single crystal analyses confirmed their structures unambiguously. The racemic mixture could further be resolved using HPLC on a chiral column. Time&#8208;dependent products distribution and interconversion between products with CsF as a catalyst were revealed by 1H NMR studies, convincing the dynamic nature of SNAr reaction.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Double Cyclizations Involving an Aza&#8208;Prins Process</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review are discussed one&#8208;pot domino/cascade/tandem bis&#8208;cyclizations involving an aza&#8208;Prins process, for poly azacycles synthesis. Those are fused, bridged or spiranic depending on the position of the nucleophile. The mechanism of the two steps together with the stereochemical outcomes are detailed.







Abstract
Piperidine derivatives are highly abundant in natural products and pharmaceutically relevant compounds. Aza&#8208;Prins cyclization has emerged as a step&#8208; atom&#8208;economical and stereoselective method for the preparation of such azacycles. The possibility of coupling aza&#8208;Prins process with the formation of a second cycle in a one&#8208;pot manner is even more powerful and makes the object of this review. Cascade/domino/tandem bis&#8208;cyclizations involving an aza&#8208;Prins process, for the rapid construction of complex small molecules, are discussed in detail.

         <title>Halogenated adenine and adenosine natural products in Streptomyces sp. JCM9888</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ascamycin 1 and dealanylascamycin 2 are adenosine containing nucleoside antibiotics carrying the rare 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;sulfamoyl ribose motif and a chlorine atom attached to C2 of the adenine ring. Gene knockouts (&#916;acmK and &#916;acmJ) in the producing strain, Streptomyces sp. JCM9888, generated mutants that were disabled in the assembly of the sulfamoyl moiety. This resulted in the production of 2&#8208;chloroadenosine 3 and 2&#8208;chloroadenine 4, indicating that purine halogenation can occur independently of sulfamoylation. Incubations in media enriched in bromide content resulted also in the identification of 2&#8208;bromoadenine 5, 2&#8208;bromoadenosine 6 and 5&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;sulfamoyl&#8208;2&#8208;bromoadenosine 7.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalyzed Electrochemical Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Aldehydes with 9,10&#8208;Dihydroacridines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acridine scaffolds are present in biological and pharmaceutical molecules. However, achieving asymmetric functionalization of acridines remains challenging without an efficient and highly stereoselective approach. Here we demonstrate a facile electrooxidative asymmetric dehydrogenative coupling reaction of 9,10&#8208;dihydroacridines with aldehydes. This method offers a sustainable and effective route to various chiral &#945;&#8208;alkylation of 9,10&#8208;dihydroacridines in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities facilitated by readily available aminocatalyst. Detailed mechanistic studies and cyclic voltammetric analyses reveal that this asymmetric electrochemical reaction proceeds through redox&#8208;mediated oxidation, followed by a nucleophilic attack with concurrently generated enamine. We anticipate that our research will open avenues for promising exploration in organocatalyzed electrochemical enantioselective transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Reactions of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes with

Enolizable 5&#8208;Mercapto&#8208;1H&#8208;tetrazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diversely substituted dimethyl 2&#8208;arylcyclopropane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates react under mild conditions, at ambient temperature in the presence of catalytic scandium triflate, with enolizable 5&#8208;meracaptotetrazoles. Most commonly, this yields the corresponding 1:1 adducts via insertion of the S&#8208;atom into the strained C,C bond, leading to ring&#8208;opening. Control experiments performed with dimethyl 2&#8208;phenylcyclopropane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylate and 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1H&#8208;tetrazole demonstrated that the initial product of the reaction is the corresponding sulfane, formed via S&#8208;insertion. However, thermal rearrangement performed at 60 &#176;C led to the formation of the isomeric N&#8208;insertion product. This rearrangement is accelerated by electron&#8208;donating substituents present at the para&#8208;position of the arene. In contrast, electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents prevent this rearrangement at room temperature, and in these examples the S&#8208;insertion products were formed exclusively.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The obtention of triarylmethanes was first evaluated in the presence of various Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acids under the same stoichiometric conditions. An efficient silver(I)&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of triarylmethanes is reported. The reaction offers low catalyst loadings and quasi stoichiometric conditions (1&#8208;1.2 equiv. of electrophile) to access to symmetric and unsymmetric TRAMs in moderate to excellent yields (35 examples). A broad scope of substrates is observed, with a chemotolerance to ester and cyano groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Anthracene&#8208;Based Mechanofluorochromic Molecules and Their Differential Mechanochromic Effects Triggered by Nitrogen Atoms</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To investigate the influence of nitrogen atoms on the mechanofluorochromic (MFC) properties, three novel anthracene&#8208;based MFC compounds were designed and synthesized, and the effects of nitrogen atom position changes on their photophysical properties and MFC properties were deeply explored. The structure of the three compounds maintains the anthracene and enone portions unchanged, with only subtle adjustments made to the position of the nitrogen atom in the pyridine moiety. Experimental verification revealed that these three anthracene&#8208;based compounds exhibit almost identical photophysical properties in solution but display significantly different fluorescence colors and distinct MFC properties in the solid state. The findings of this study not only offer a new perspective for understanding the MFC mechanism of anthracene&#8208;based compounds but also provide valuable insights for the design and development of novel MFC molecules.</dc:description>

A diaminomethylenemalononitrile organocatalyst promoted asymmetric cascade Michael/Michael reactions between a 2&#8208;(trifluoromethylmethylene)indane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione derivative and &#945;&#8208;alkylidene succinimides, resulting in spiroindane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione derivatives. These derivatives feature four consecutive carbon stereocenters, including one stereocenter with a trifluoromethyl substituent, and were formed in high yield with excellent enantioselectivity







Abstract
A diaminomethylenemalononitrile organocatalyst efficiently promoted asymmetric cascade Michael/Michael reactions between a 2&#8208;(trifluoromethylmethylene)indane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione derivative and &#945;&#8208;alkylidene succinimides, resulting in spiroindane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione derivatives. These derivatives feature four consecutive carbon stereocenters, including one stereocenter with a trifluoromethyl substituent, and were formed in high yield with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 94&#8201;% ee). This study marks the first successful example of using methyleneindane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione derivatives, bearing alkoxycarbonyl and trifluoromethyl groups at the &#946;&#8208;position, as Michael acceptors.

         <title>A Concise Ring Closing Enyne Metathesis Approach for the Preparation of Functionalized Proline&#8208;Derived Azabicycloalkane Amino Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constrained C4&#8208;functionalized dipeptide derivatives incorporating a proline moiety were prepared in high yields by exploiting a direct ring closing enyne metathesis (RCEYM) reaction. Post&#8208;functionalization studies of the newly introduced diene system pave the way for future applications in peptide synthesis, medicinal chemistry and nanotechnology.







Abstract
Herein we report the preparation of C4&#8208;functionalized proline&#8208;derived azabicycloalkane (Aba) amino acids by exploiting a direct ring closing enyne metathesis reaction of readily accessible dipeptide precursors. The reverse&#8208;turn inducing properties of the newly synthesized constrained dipeptide mimics were assessed by computational studies. Furthermore, the desired Aba derivatives, carrying a synthetically versatile diene moiety, were subjected to post&#8208;functionalization reactions to validate their potential application in peptide/peptidomimetic chemistry and drug discovery.

         <dc:description>
Herein, we have developed the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free approach for the chemo&#8208;selective synthesis of the pyrazole and its derivatives from acetopheneones. The selectivity of the reaction can easily be tuned by shifting reaction from acidic to basic medium for the synthesis of pyrazolo&#8208;pyrirmidines and pyrazolo&#8208;pyridines respectively.







Abstract
Pyrazoles and pyrazolo fused pyrimidines and pyridines are well known for their applications in various fields like pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and materials sciences. Keeping this in mind herein, we have developed the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free approach for the chemo&#8208;selective synthesis of the pyrazole and its derivatives from acetopheneones. The selectivity of the reaction can easily be tuned by shifting reaction from acidic to basic medium for the synthesis of pyrazolo&#8208;pyrirmidines and pyrazolo&#8208;pyridines respectively. The reaction shows excellent functional group tolerance in the form of &#8722;F, &#8722;Cl, &#8722;Br, &#8722;NMe2, &#8722;OH, &#8722;OMe, and &#8722;B(OH)2 in good yields.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C60&#8208;fragmentary bowl&#8208;shaped molecules, commonly referred to as &#8220;buckybowls&#8221;, are provocative compounds, and their inviting functions based on the non&#8208;planar pi&#8208;conjugation are expected. Yet, achieving synthesis of some kinds of the curved structure remaining challenging. Herein we report skeletal construction of a nonacyclic buckybowl that is synthetically unachievable heretofore, namely, 3,10&#8208;dihydroindeno[7,1,2&#8208;pqr]&#8208;as&#8208;indaceno[3,2,1,8,7&#8208;defghi]chrysene. The key to success was solution&#8208;compatible process in which a multiple substituted dibenzo[g,p]chrysene is amenable to threefold formation of five&#8208;membered rings at its periphery. The resulting scheme here, coupled with the gently curved scaffold, offers a new insight into the solution&#8208;phase synthesis of curved and twisted polyarenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Preferential Binding to a Mannoside of a&#160; Pyridine&#8211;Acetylene&#8211;Phenol Macrocycle&#160;with a Fluorine Substituent in the Cavity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We developed a pyridine&#8211;acetylene&#8211;phenol macrocycle in which a fluorine atom was introduced in place of a hydroxy group, as a host for the selective binding to epimers of glucose. The fluorine atom was expected to work as a negatively charged infill repelling oxygen atoms of saccharides andprevent the efficient formation of a hydrogen&#8208;bond network with a glucoside, whose cross&#8208;section size is larger than those of the corresponding epimers, especially of a mannoside. UV&#8722;Vis and fluorescence titration experiments revealed that this host showed a higher affinity for a mannoside than a glucoside. 1H NMR and molecular modeling suggested that the fluorine atom acts as a moderate infill weakening the binding to a glucoside.This result indicates that selectivity for guest molecules can be modified by replacing a hydroxy group and a hydrogen atom in host molecules with a fluorine atom.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;Promoted Regioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Amino BODIPYs through Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling with Anilines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of &#945;&#8208;amino BODIPYs were synthesized through a base&#8208;promoted oxidative cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling with air as a green oxidant. Furthermore, these newly synthesized BODIPYs showed potential applications as organic probes.







Abstract
The construction of C&#8722;N bond at the &#945;&#8208;position of BODIPYs (boron dipyrromethene) not only enables flexible reactivity but also leads to strong electron&#8208;donating properties. In this study, a base&#8208;promoted oxidative cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling was developed to synthesize &#945;&#8208;amino BODIPYs with air as a green oxidant. By this strategy, a series of weak nitrogen nucleophiles, such as heteroaryl and aryl anilines, were installed to the &#945;&#8208;position. Remarkably, pyrrole, pyrazole and indole were also employed to realize the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;heteroaryl BODIPYs through direct functionalization. Further aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIE) properties and lipid droplet&#8208;targeting bioimaging experiments of representative dyes demonstrated their potential applications as organic probes.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient photocatalysis has been developed for the synthesis of indanone using low&#8208;energy green light as input energy. This methodology provides a greener avenue to construct indanone through a metal&#8208;free photocatalytic radical annulation reaction between &#945;&#8208;keto acid and internal alkyne.







Abstract
Low&#8208;energy light, endowing with excellent characteristics of lower energy, fewer side reactions, more abundance in solar light. The scenario has been developed for the fabrication of indenone through a low&#8208;energy green light driven radical annulation reaction between &#945;&#8208;keto acids and internal alkynes using Rhodamine 6G as photocatalyst. Various kinds of substrates are suitable for this methodology, affording the corresponding indenones in a greener and efficient manner.

         <title>Nonheme Fe Based Enzyme Mimics for Fine Organic Synthesis: Catalytic C&#8722;H and C=C Oxygenations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept discusses the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of bioinspired non&#8208;heme Fe catalyzed oxidations of organic molecules and analyzes the peculiarities of their catalytic reactivity which may be in demand for the synthesis of oxyfunctionalized molecules of variable complexity.







Abstract
Since the milestone contribution by Chen and White in 2007, bioinspired non&#8208;heme bis&#8208;amino&#8208;bis&#8208;pyridylmethyl Fe complexes have been at the forefront of studies related to designing catalytic approaches for direct oxidative functionalization of aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds. This, however, has not developed into large&#8208;scale synthetic applications to date. The present concept is aimed at briefly discussing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of non&#8208;heme Fe catalyzed oxidations of organic molecules with H2O2, the current oxidant of choice of bioinspired oxidation catalysis, mostly focusing on C&#8722;H oxidations, and analyzing the peculiarities of their reactivity through the prism of potential applications in fine organic synthesis.

         <title>Sustainable Domino C&#8722;N/C&#8722;C Bond Formation with Outstanding E Factors and High Volume Productivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This newly developed single&#8208;flask, solvent&#8208;free process accomplishes sequential C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C bond formations. It leads to (&#946;&#8208;cyano)anilines by use of aryl triflates, Schiff bases, and CH3CN as a reagent. Key features of this neat method include a domino process, ambient temperature, short reaction time, and alignment with sustainability principles.







Abstract
One of the primary concerns in the development of new chemical reactions pertains to the choice of solvents, many of which can have harmful ecological impacts. Additionally, a major portion of waste generated in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries comes from the solvents employed. The elimination of solvent usage is highly desirable for creation of environmentally friendly chemical processes as it leads to a substantial reduction in waste production. Accordingly, a novel neat reaction was developed for the synthesis of (&#946;&#8208;amino)nitriles as a prominent moiety through a domino process. It involved the use of silylphenyl triflates, Schiff bases, and acetonitrile (CH3CN) in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio, among which CH3CN served as a starting material rather than a solvent. This reaction was initiated by caesium fluoride (CsF) to form an aryne through 1,2&#8208;elimination followed by sequential 1,2&#8208;addition, proton transfer, and a second 1,2&#8208;addition. Complete conversion was carried out at 25&#8201;&#176;C for 1.0&#8197;h to give (&#946;&#8208;amino)nitriles in 76&#8211;88&#8201;% yields. This solvent&#8208;free reaction minimized waste production and reduced costs associated with extra reagents, solvents, and labour. It possesses a compelling E factor and impressive volume productivity. This reaction sets a new benchmark for solvent&#8208;free aryne domino processes in green chemistry advancements.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of the Indolo[2,3&#8208;&#945;]quinolizine Alkaloid (+)&#8208;Cuscutamine via a Diastereoselective Intramolecular Pictet&#8208;Spengler Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise total synthesis of the natural product (11S, 13R)&#8208;Cuscutamine was achieved involving a diastereoselective intramolecular acyl iminium ion mediated Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction. The diastereoselectivity of the reaction is consistent with previous studies that proceed via more highly puckered transition states and the present results thus reveals the importance of the steric contribution to the diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
A concise total synthesis of Cuscutamine was achieved involving a diastereoselective intramolecular acyl iminium ion mediated Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction. This synthetic strategy provided a direct route to (11S, 13R)&#8208;Cuscutamine (2) in only 3 steps with an overall yield of 56&#8201;% and an enantiomeric ratio of 88&#8201;%. The diastereoselectivity of the reaction is consistent with previous studies that proceed via more highly puckered transition states and the present results thus reveal the importance of the steric contributions to the observed diastereoselectivity.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel iodonium salt mediated methodology activating sulfur atom, promoting the conversion of sulfides into sulfoxides exploiting DMSO as the sole oxidant. An easy access to pharmaceutical active compounds such as Sulforaphane and Modafinil.







Abstract
Compounds bearing the sulfoxide moiety display an important class of molecules in pharmaceutical industry. Many efforts have been made towards the development of novel, sustainable, easy&#8208;to&#8208;execute and industrially friendly processes. A novel iodonium&#8208;salt&#8208;mediated oxidation protocol for the conversion of sulfides into the corresponding sulfoxides is reported, employing DMSO as the oxidant. Several sulfides decorated with various functional groups were tested, leading to the corresponding products in good to excellent yields with remarkable chemoselectivity. The oxidation protocol was successfully applied to the synthesis of the pharmaceutical active ingredients (APIs) Sulforaphane and Modafinil.

         <title>Reduction and Hydrocyanation of Aziridines with C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unusual C&#8722;C bond cleavage of 2,3&#8208;diaryl aziridines took place to afford secondary amines by formal dihydrogenation and hydrocyanation. Formal dehydrogenation was performed by electrocyclic ring opening of N&#8208;Li or N&#8208;Na aziridines to azaallyl anions followed by reduction with NaBH4. Formal hydrocyanation was realized by treating azaallyl anions with Me3SiCN.







Abstract
The carbon&#8208;carbon bond in three&#8208;membered ring of 2,3&#8208;diaryl aziridines was reductively cleaved to give the corresponding dibenzylamine derivatives by electrocyclic ring opening of N&#8208;Li or N&#8208;Na aziridines followed by reduction of the 2&#8208;azaallyl anion formed with sodium borohydride in ethanol. Hydrocyanation of the 2&#8208;azaallyl anion with trimethylsilyl cyanide gave a secondary amine bearing a cyano group at the benzylic position. The effects of substituents on the electrocyclic ring opening of N&#8208;Li aziridines were also clarified.

         <title>Synthetic Strategies to Prepare Bioactive Lysine and Peptide Conjugates With Triazolium Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid phase synthesis of lysine and peptide conjugates of Safirinium derivatives allowed demonstration of the relevance of Safirinium&#8208;lysine conjugates and building blocks as inhibitors of porcine pancrease elastase.







Abstract
Peptides conjugated with organic molecules can be useful tools for the development of novel bioactive compounds. The lysine side&#8208;chain is an interesting functional group to act as a linker to connect small molecules in peptide conjugates. Herein we present the design and synthesis of four Safirinium derivatives, their facile conjugation to lysine in solid phase, and incorporation in peptides. The compounds differing in the functionalization of nitrogen N2 of the condensed triazolyl moiety are novel building blocks to design conjugates to perform structure&#8208;activity relationship studies of elastase inhibitors. Consequently, structural investigations of the lysine building blocks and of the corresponding peptide conjugates were performed. We present herein the potential of the Safirinium analogs to act as elastase inhibitors in assays performed on porcine pancreas elastase.

         <title>Experiment Meets Theory: Cope Rearrangements and Thermal E/Z Isomerisations of Terpenoid Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermal reactions including Cope rearrangements and E/Z isomerisations of three diterpenoids were investigated experimentally. In addition, DFT calculations were performed to explain the experimental findings of this study and of related systems from the literature. It is demonstrated that accurate computational data are only obtained, if ensembles of most stable conformers are considered.







Abstract
Several terpenes are known that can undergo a Cope rearrangement. Prominent examples include germacrene A and hedycaryol that show a Cope rearrangement already slightly above room temperature. In the present study the Cope rearrangements of several terpenes and eventually co&#8208;occurring thermal E/Z isomerisations were investigated experimentally for their minimum required temperatures and for their states of equilibrium. The experimental findings were supported by computational assessments of free activation energies (&#916;G&#8800;) as well as relative Gibbs free energies of the reactants (&#916;G).

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Alkynylation of Carbazoles with Alkynyl Bromides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct alkynylation of carbazoles, without the need for oxidants or sensitive reagents, has been developed. The broad substrate compatibility, scalability, and mechanistic insights underscore the method's significance for pharmaceutical and materials science applications.







Abstract
Carbazole derivatives are vital in medicinal and materials chemistry, yet accessing diverse substitutions remains challenging. Here, we introduce a regioselective approach for C1 and C8 alkynylation of carbazoles via palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation. This method provides a direct route to mono&#8208; and di&#8208;alkynylated derivatives, addressing the scarcity of alkynylated carbazole&#8208;based materials. Our study broadens the synthetic toolbox for carbazole functionalization, offering potential applications in optoelectronics, bio&#8208;imaging, and beyond, while contributing to developing sustainable C&#8722;H activation methodologies.

         <title>Unraveling the Potential of Cyclic N&#8208;Sulfonyl Ketimines in the MCR Universe</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We utilized cyclic N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines, a privileged class of heterocycles with extensive applications in organic and medicinal chemistry, in four distinct IMCRs, aiming to generate compound libraries compatible for structural elaboration. Four scaffolds, 15 novel compounds with high diversity and complexity, along with single crystal structures for each scaffold have been obtained, revealing their potential relevance in drug discovery.







Abstract
Cyclic N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines constitute an accessible class of lead&#8208;like heterocycles with a vast application in both synthetic organic and medicinal chemistry. In this context, we harness the capabilities of these heterocycles in four different isocyanide&#8208;based multicomponent reactions. Our goal was to create libraries of compounds with functional groups and vectors that are compatible for structural elaboration and optimization of their physical properties. We synthesized 15 unprecedented compounds with high diversity and complexity, whereas we have obtained four single crystal structures of each scaffold, unraveling their geometrical features and potential employment in drug discovery.

A highly effective method utilizing KOtBu is reported for the regioselective production of pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]quinolin&#8208;1&#8208;one and naphthyridin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;one derivatives from o&#8208;alkynylquinolinecarbonitriles.







Abstract
A KOtBu&#8208;promoted robust strategy has been described for the regioselective synthesis of pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]quinolin&#8208;1&#8208;one and naphthyridin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;one derivatives from o&#8208;alkynylquinolinecarbonitriles in good to excellent yields. The reaction proceeds through in&#8197;situ transformation of the nitrile moiety into an amide group followed by the selective C&#8722;N bond formation through a 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig or 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig annulation reaction. Among the synthesized derivatives, 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig naphthyridin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones displayed good photophysical properties. The present approach is superior to other established methodologies as it avoids use of transition metals and column chromatographic purification and affords the products in high yields. Additionally, the current methodology provides several additional advantages, such as one&#8208;pot operation, high atom economy, broad substrate scope and a step&#8208;economical process.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Heterobiaryl N&#8208;Cbz&#8208;Protected Diamines via Organocatalytic Arylation of 5&#8208;Aminoisoxazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axially chiral arylisoxazoles with high yields (up to 96&#8201;%) and excellent enantiomeric purities (up to 97&#8201;% ee) were synthesized through organocatalytic arylation of isoxazoles with N&#8208;Cbz&#8208;protected azonaphthalenes. Cbz protecting group can be readily removed, resulting in axially chiral heterobiaryl amines bearing free amine maintaining enantiomeric purity.







Abstract
An enantioselective arylation of isoxazoles with N&#8208;Cbz&#8208;protected azonaphthalenes is disclosed, affording a range of axially chiral arylisoxazoles in good yields and excellent enantiocontrol by utilizing chiral phosphoric acid. Cbz protecting group can be readily removed, resulting in five&#8208;six membered axially chiral heterobiaryl amines bearing free amine maintaining enantiomeric purity.

         <title>Fluorinated Chiral Pyrans Obtained via Mechanochemical Organocatalytic Michael/oxa&#8208;Michael Cascade</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical organocatalytic Michael/oxa&#8208;Michael cascade with fluorine containing unsaturated oxoesters and enones afford chiral fluorinated pyranes. Liquid&#8208;assisted grinding provide products in high yields and short reactions times. Diastereodivergency can be achieved by using either bifunctional thiourea or quinine organocatalyst.







Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;containing compounds are important in medicine or crop&#8208;protection. Herein, we show asymmetric organocatalytic Michael/oxa&#8208;Michael cascade leading to chiral fluorinated pyrans under mechanochemical conditions. Formal oxa&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between fluorine containing unsaturated keto esters and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones afforded a range of drug&#8208;like pyran derivatives in short times and good to high yields. Ball&#8208;milling conveys the reaction in short times and high product yields, while keeping high enantiomeric purities of products. The reaction is diastereodivergent depending on the use of either monofunctional amine catalysts or bifunctional thiourea or squaramide.

&lt;p&gt;Mechanochemical organocatalytic Michael/oxa-Michael cascade with fluorine containing unsaturated oxoesters and enones afford chiral fluorinated pyranes. Liquid-assisted grinding provide products in high yields and short reactions times. Diastereodivergency can be achieved by using either bifunctional thiourea or quinine organocatalyst.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorine-containing compounds are important in medicine or crop-protection. Herein, we show asymmetric organocatalytic Michael/oxa-Michael cascade leading to chiral fluorinated pyrans under mechanochemical conditions. Formal oxa-Diels-Alder reaction between fluorine containing unsaturated keto esters and &#946;,&#947;-unsaturated ketones afforded a range of drug-like pyran derivatives in short times and good to high yields. Ball-milling conveys the reaction in short times and high product yields, while keeping high enantiomeric purities of products. The reaction is diastereodivergent depending on the use of either monofunctional amine catalysts or bifunctional thiourea or squaramide.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
