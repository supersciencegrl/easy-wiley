         <title>Understanding the Alkylation Mechanism of 3&#8208;Chloropiperidines &#8211; NMR Kinetic Studies and Isolation of Bicyclic Aziridinium Ions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present study describes the kinetic analysis of the 3&#8208;chloropiperidine alkylation mechanism. These nitrogen mustard based compounds are expected to react via a highly electrophilic bicyclic aziridinium ion, which is readily attacked by nucleophiles. Halide abstraction using silver salts with weakly coordinating anions lead to the isolation of these proposed intermediates, whereas their structure was confirmed by single crystal XRD. Kinetic studies of the aziridinium ions also revealed notable reactivity differences of the C5 gem&#8208;methylated compounds and their unmethylated counterparts. The observed reactivity trends were also reflected by NMR studies in aqueous solution and DNA alkylation experiments of the related 3&#8208;chloropiperidines. Therefore, the underlying Thorpe&#8208;Ingold effect might be considered as another option to adjust the alkylation activity of these compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of Enantiopure HMPA Analogs in Samarium Diiodide&#8208;Promoted Dearomatizations of N&#8208;Acylated Indole Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of (  S  )&#8208;proline&#8208;based enantiopure phosphorous triamide derivatives were prepared and evaluated as HMPA alternative in samarium diiodide cyclization reactions of  N  &#8208;acylated indole derivatives. The expected tricyclic indoline derivatives were generally obtained in good to excellent yields, however, the induced enantioselectivities were at best moderate. In our model reaction, the phosphorous triamide derivative with a (dimethyl)hydroxymethyl group at the stereogenic center provided the cyclization product in almost quantitative yield and with an enantiomeric excess of approximately 24%. No separate proton source is required by applying this chiral Lewis base which was recovered in 93% yield. Bulkier substituents at the stereogenic center did not furnish improved results. Although in our preliminary study only low to moderate enantioselectivities could be achieved the observed fast conversions and the high yields demonstrate the basic suitability of chiral pyrrolidine&#8208;based phosphoramide Lewis bases in samarium(II)&#8208;induced reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>The Step&#8208;Wise Synthesis of Oligomeric Phosphoramidates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ex(P&#8722;N)ding the chain. Salt elimination and lithiation strategies were employed in the step&#8208;wise synthesis of oligomers with P&#8722;N linkages having potential as environment friendly flame retardants due to their lack of anti&#8208;microbial activity.







Abstract
In this study, the step&#8208;wise synthesis to a series of higher phosphoramidates was explored, affording compounds containing N&#8722;P&#8722;N, symmetric and asymmetric P&#8722;N&#8722;P and P&#8722;N&#8722;P&#8722;N&#8722;P linkages. Salt elimination and lithiation strategies were employed to create the new P&#8722;N bonds. It was found that the steric bulk and electronic contribution of the substituents on the P(V) centers were important factors to the success of the reactions. The oligomeric phosphoramidates were characterized by multinuclear NMR and IR spectroscopies as well as ESI mass spectrometry. A selection of the synthesized P&#8722;N oligomers were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against E.coli, S.aureus, C.albicans, and A.fumigatus at varying concentrations. The results suggest their potential use as environmentally friendly fire retardants as the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) value for all the compounds was found to be &gt;128&#8197;&#956;M, indicating that the compounds do not have any detectable antimicrobial activity.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative 1,2&#8208;Addition of Carboxylic Acids to Glyoxylic Acid Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Palladium&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;addition reaction of carboxylic acids to glyoxylic acid esters is reported. This method provides access to mandelic acid derivatives from simple, readily available starting materials in good yields. Carboxylic acids are utilized as more sustainable alternative to common organometallic nucleophiles.







Abstract
The formation of C&#8722;C&#8208;bonds constitutes one of the most fundamental synthetic operations in organic chemistry. The nucleophilic addition of preformed organometallic reagents to an electrophilic carbonyl functionality represents a classical method for the selective construction of a C&#8722;C&#8208;bond. However, the synthesis and utilization of an organometallic reagent is associated with an unfavorable environmental profile. Herein, we disclose a Palladium&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative 1,2&#8208;addition of carboxylic acids to glyoxylic acid esters. This novel method provides access to the mandelic acid scaffold in good yields. Easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle and readily available benzoic acids are utilized as more sustainable alternative to preformed organometallic nucleophiles.

         <title>Stabilizing Indigo Z&#8208;Isomer through Intramolecular Associations of Redox&#8208;Active Appendages</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active indenofluorene&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene units were added as appendages to the indigo photoswitch. Upon oxidation of these two units to radical cations, a significantly enhanced stability of the indigo Z&#8208;isomer was observed. Thus, the half&#8208;life for the Z&#8208;to&#8208;E isomerization changed from less than a second to several hours upon formation of the dication, ascribed to intramolecular association between the two radical cation units.







Abstract
Photoswitchable small molecules, such as N,N&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted indigos, have received great interest within fields such as pharmacology, energy storage, and functional materials, as they represent key building blocks for reversible and non&#8208;invasive control of chemical processes. However, to ensure applicability of photochromic systems it is of paramount importance to manipulate the photostationary state. In this work, we achieved this by tethering two redox&#8208;active indenofluorene&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene units to an N,N&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted indigo photoswitch. Upon two&#8208;electron oxidation, we observe significantly enhanced stability of the Z&#8208;isomer, compared to the neutral compound, illustrated by a substantial increase in the half&#8208;life from 0.48&#8197;seconds to 22&#8197;hours. This remarkable stabilization is ascribed to formation of strong, intramolecular &#960;&#8208;dimers between the oxidized subunits.

         <title>Sulfoximine&#8208;Directed Arene ortho&#8208;Lithiation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfoximines are an interesting class of compounds, which exhibit Br&#248;nsted and Lewis basicity, nucleophilicity, C&#8208;H acidity, N&#8208;H acidity, hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor capability and chirality. Sulfoximines have received renewed interest in recent times, since incorporation of a sulfoximine group can provide drug candidates with favorable properties. The synthesis and N&#8208;H, &#945; &#8208;C&#8208;H and o &#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization of sulfoximines are currently topics of considerable interest. This mini&#8208;review describes the sulfoximine&#8208;directed arene ortho &#8208;lithiation and the synthesis of ortho &#8208;substituted S&#8208;aryl sulfoximines. Comparison between the sulfoximine and sulfone group shows that both are equally potent directors in arene ortho &#8208;lithiation. Double ortho &#8208;lithiation of S&#8208;phenyl sulfoximines affords o , o&#180; &#8208;dilithiosulfoximines, which undergo a stereoretentive rearrangement to o &#8208;sulfinylanilines. S&#8208;Phenyl sulfoximines, carrying a &#945; &#8208;hydrogen atom, are amendable to a selective ortho &#8208;lithiation to give o &#8208;lithiosulfoximines, which suffer transmetalation to the &#945; &#8208;lithiosulfoximines at ambient temperatures. Double lithiation of S&#8208;phenyl N&#8208;H sulfoximines gives access to o, N&#8208;dilithiosulfoximines, the reaction of which with biselectrophiles yields bicyclic sulfoximines.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrosilylation of Alkenes Using a Hydrosiloxane as a Surrogate for Me2SiH2&#160;and Catalyzed by a Nickel&#8208;Pincer Complex</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a hydrosilylation reaction of alkenes using 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethyldisiloxane (TMDS) as a surrogate for Me  2  SiH  2  in the presence of NaOMe, catalyzed by a bench&#8208;stable nickel&#8208;pincer complex supported by a monoanionic  O  ,  N,  P  &#8208;tridentate ligand. The reaction of styrene derivatives proceeds smoothly under mild conditions to provide the hydrosilylated products in high yields with high Markovnikov selectivity.

Secondary hydrosilanes are also suitable under the present reaction conditions and furnish the desired products in high yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative dearomatization of phenols and polycyclic aromatics with hydrogen peroxide triggered by heterogeneous sulfonic acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein a method for the oxidative dearomatization of phenols and bare polycyclic arenes into the corresponding quinoid derivatives using hydrogen peroxide. The reaction is catalyzed by sulfonic acids and best results were achieved using heterogenized species. The best results using phenols were achieved through the use of a hybrid material, namely a perfluorinated polymer functionalized with sulfonic acid groups supported on silica. The dearomatization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons performed better using the polymeric acid catalyst. These methods operate under mild conditions, using mild and benign oxidants and thus minimizing the formation of wastes.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Aroylsulfonamide&#8208;Photofragmentation (ASAP)&#8208;A Versatile Route to Biaryls</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile and powerful method for the preparation of biaryls is described, which is based on the photochemical fragmentation of N&#8208;aroylsulfonamides. In addition to biaryls, isocyanates and sulfur dioxide are formed.







Abstract
The photochemical fragmentation of N&#8208;aroylsulfonamides 9 (ASAP) is a powerful method for the preparation of various biaryls. Compounds 9 are easily accessible in two steps from amines by treatment with arenesulfonyl chlorides and aroyl chlorides. Many of these compounds were prepared for the first time. The irradiation takes place in a previously developed continuous&#8208;flow reactor using inexpensive UVB or UVC fluorescent lamps. Isocyanates and sulphur dioxide are formed as the only by&#8208;products. The ASAP tolerates a variety of functional groups and is even suited for the preparation of phenylnaphthalenes and terphenyls. The ASAP mechanism was elucidated by interaction of photophysical and quantum chemical (DFT) methods and revealed a spirocyclic biradical as key intermediate.

An efficient protocol for enantioselective domino Michael/&#945;&#8208;alkylation between &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes and non&#8208;stabilized nitro alkyl halides has been reported. Reaction catalyzed by chiral secondary amines as organocatalysts gives an access to enantiomerically enriched 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted cyclopentanes with wide range of substitution.







Abstract
An organocatalytic asymmetric domino Michael/&#945;&#8208;alkylation reaction between enals and non&#8208;stabilized alkyl halides has been developed. Chiral secondary amine catalyzed cyclization reaction of 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;3&#8208;nitropropane with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes provides 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted cyclopentane carbaldehydes with high diastereo&#8208; (dr up to 8&#8201;:&#8201;1) and enantioselectivities (ee up to 96&#8201;%).

         <title>Bifunctional Cs&#8722;Au/Co3O4 (Basic and Redox)&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Synthesis of Aromatic Azo Compounds from Anilines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 36, Page 5063-5073, September 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alkali&#8208;promoted gold&#8208;based (Cs&#8722;Au/Co3O4) catalyst with redox and basic properties was designed to perform the oxidative coupling of anilines to symmetrical and unsymmetrical aromatic azo compounds. The process proceeded under milder reaction conditions without base additive and molecular O2 oxidant (using air). The catalyst performance was easily correlated to the effect of lattice oxygen, low reduction temperatures, and increased basic site concentrations, with reusability achieved up to six cycles.







Abstract
An eco&#8208;friendly alkali&#8208;promoted (Cs&#8722;Au/Co3O4) catalyst, with redox and basic properties for the oxidative dehydrogenative coupling of anilines to symmetrical and unsymmetrical aromatic azo compounds, was developed. We realized a base additive&#8208; and molecular O2 oxidant&#8208;free process (using air), with reasonable reusability of the catalyst achieved under milder reaction conditions. Notably, the enhanced catalytic activity was also linked to the increased basic site concentration, low reduction temperatures, and the effect of lattice oxygen on the nanomaterials. The increased basic strength of the cation&#8208;promoted catalyst improved the electron density of the active Au species, resulting in higher yields of the desired aromatic azo compounds.

         <title>Aryl Fluoroalkyl Sulfoxides: Optical Stability and pKa Measurement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 36, Page 5019-5026, September 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Key properties of chiral aryl fluoroalkyl sulfoxides with strong synthetic potential were studied. After resolution by enantioselective chromatography, their optical stability was investigated by thermal enantiomerization via enantioselective chromatography. Their &#916;G values range from 38.2 to 41.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at 214&#8201;&#176;C. In addition, the pKa values of six aryl difluoromethyl sulfoxides were determined via indirect UV&#8208;visible spectrophotometric titrations in DMSO and are in the range of 20.3&#8211;22.5.







Abstract
The enantiomeric separation of aryl trifluoromethyl and difluoromethyl sulfoxides was realized via chiral chromatography. The configurational stability of each set of enantiomers was then studied by thermal enantiomerization. The &#916;G&#8800; values obtained cover a range of 38.2&#8211;41.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at 214&#8201;&#176;C, thus demonstrating their optical stability at room temperature. However, a shorter half&#8208;life time has been observed for difluoromethyl sulfoxides. Furthermore, the acidities of six aryl difluoromethyl sulfoxides were determined in DMSO by an overlapping indicator method using UV&#8208;visible spectrophotometric titrations. The pKa values fall in range of 20.3&#8211;22.5 and differ by about 10&#8197;log units compared to non&#8208;fluorinated analogues.

         <title>Azaphilone Pigments from Hypoxylon rubiginosum and H. texense: Absolute Configuration, Bioactivity, and Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 36, Page 5094-5103, September 24, 2021. </description>

Rubiginosins Z&#8208;W, novel azaphilone pigments from stromata of Hypoxylon rubiginosum and H. texense, were isolated. Extensive HRMS, NMR, and ECD analysis revealed their stereochemistry and yielded missing configurations of known congeners. Unlike the related H.&#8201;fragiforme, H.&#8197;rubiginosum and H.&#8197;texense exclusively produce C&#8208;8(S)&#8208;isomers, which was confirmed by genome analysis.







Abstract
We report new stromatal azaphilone pigments rubiginosins Z&#8208;X from the ascomycete Hypoxylon rubiginosum, as well as rubiginosins Z and W from H. texense, which were isolated along with known monomeric and dimeric congeners. Structures were elucidated using comprehensive HRMS, NMR, and ECD analysis, revealing azaphilones from both fungi to be exclusively C&#8208;8(S)&#8208;configured. The orsellinic acid (OA)&#8208;carrying rubiginosins A, Z and dimeric rutilins A&#8208;B exhibited cytotoxicity. Rubiginosins X&#8208;W bearing linear polyketide side chains as well as rutilins A&#8208;B were antimicrobial. Structures of the differently&#8208;substituted azaphilones were linked to two putative biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs; hraza1/2) in H.&#8197;rubiginosum, which are proposed to collaboratively synthesize the OA&#8208;substituted azaphilones. These share high homology with the azaphilone&#8208;forming BGCs hfaza1/2 from H.&#8197;fragiforme. Comparison of hraza and hfaza suggests that lack of an FAD&#8208;dependent monooxygenase and acyltransferase gene in hraza1 prevent formation of C&#8208;8(R)&#8208;configured fatty acid&#8208;substituted azaphilones in H.&#8197;rubiginosum. The polyketide synthase&#8208;derived side chain of rubiginosins C and X&#8208;W is not encoded in the respective BGCs, showing that a third BGC is hypothetically involved in their formation. Cross&#8208;interaction of three BGCs which are forming a single molecule is unprecedented in fungal natural product biosynthesis.

         <title>Cover Feature: Applications of Purine Ring Opening in the Synthesis of Imidazole, Pyrimidine, and New Purine Derivatives (Eur. J. Org. Chem. 36/2021)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 36, Page 5018-5018, September 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows the essence of purine ring opening pathways. Electrophilic activation of purine by pulling its electron density from N(1) or N(7) and subsequent nucleophile attack ensures the ring&#8208;opening of the pyrimidine or imidazole part of the parent heterocycle. The obtained products can be used as such or submitted to further rearrangements and cyclizations. This methodology is a useful addition to the synthetic toolbox of heterocyclic chemistry. More information can be found in the Review by I. Novosjolova, M. Turks et&#8197;al.

The Front Cover shows the introduction of fluorinated groups into molecules, which gives them interesting and sometimes unexpected physicochemical properties and reactivity. In this study, the configurational stability of fluoroalkyl sulfoxides (shown on the flyer) was investigated and the pKa value of the &#8208;CHF2 group was determined, which is very important for medicinal and agrochemical research. The picture is reminiscent of &#8220;Kinder Surpise&#8221;&#174; where the sulfoxide appears as an exciting molecular toy and the surprises are the physical data determined because nothing was known before about this type of compounds (copyright of the illustration by J.&#8208;F.

         <title>Applications of Purine Ring Opening in the Synthesis of Imidazole, Pyrimidine, and New Purine Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 36, Page 5027-5052, September 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ring system of purine is remarkably stable, but can be opened at either side, if properly activated. In this review, purine ring opening reactions leading to imidazole and pyrimidine derivatives are summarized. Purine ring opening is also a powerful tool for the synthesis of new ring&#8208;modified purine derivatives (e.&#8201;g., N1&#8208;labelled analogs) by various rearrangement pathways.







Abstract
Purines, which are regarded as relatively stable heterocyclic systems, can be opened at both pyrimidine and imidazole rings. Purine ring opening also serves as a tool for the preparation of ring&#8208;modified purines through rearrangement/recyclization mechanisms. The obtained imidazole, pyrimidine, and purine derivatives are privileged molecular scaffolds in medicinal and agricultural chemistry. Purine ring&#8208;opening approach is a useful alternative for their synthesis, which competes well with de novo approach or modification of a conserved heterocyclic core. The substitution patterns and groups that activate purines towards ring opening are reviewed. Moreover, mechanistic studies using labelled substrates, which are leading to rearranged purine derivatives are covered. Furthermore, an insight into imidazole ring opening upon exposure of purine system to DNA damaging agents is provided.

     alt="Applications of Purine Ring Opening in the Synthesis of Imidazole, Pyrimidine, and New Purine Derivatives"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ring system of purine is remarkably stable, but can be opened at either side, if properly activated. In this review, purine ring opening reactions leading to imidazole and pyrimidine derivatives are summarized. Purine ring opening is also a powerful tool for the synthesis of new ring-modified purine derivatives (&lt;i&gt;e.&#8201;g&lt;/i&gt;., &lt;i&gt;N1&lt;/i&gt;-labelled analogs) by various rearrangement pathways.

         <title>Continuous Flow Organocatalytic Chlorination of Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 36, Page 5058-5062, September 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous flow&#8208;friendly organocatalytic chlorination of alkenes has been developed. The method implicates the catalytic system PhS(O)Me/TMSCl and makes use of environmentally benign H2O2, as the stoichiometric regenerator of the sulfoxide catalyst. Under these conditions, internal disubstituted and terminal alkenes cleanly convert to the corresponding anti&#8208;dichlorides, while electron rich trisubstituted or 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes provided allylic chlorination products.







Abstract
A regioselective anti&#8208;dichlorination and allylic chlorination of isolated double bonds is described. Such chlorination reactions benefit from a combination of methyl phenyl sulfoxide and TMSCl. The method has been appropriately adjusted to fit the continuous flow technology requirements, aiming to a broader industrial implementation for the synthesis of pharmaceutically important compounds. Towards the same direction, a catalytic protocol has been developed, using sub&#8208;stoichiometric amount of sulfoxide and environmentally friendly H2O2 as the stoichiometric oxidant, with comparable efficacy.

Subtle changes of substitution pattern of fluorine in the phenyl moiety resulted in unexpected reversal of regioselectivity of methanolysis and interception of Curtius rearrangement of quaternary acids to their corresponding amines.







Abstract
Unprecedented reversal in regioselectivity during methanolysis of anhydrides due to the change in substitution pattern of fluorine in the phenyl moiety, and the formation of nitrene intercepted intermediates during Curtius rearrangement of the acids were the major impediments for discovering bioactive molecules in beta amyloid cleaving enzyme&#8208;1 (BACE1) program. Solutions to these synthetic challenges, and our investigation into this unexpected change in reactivity are discussed.

A facile protocol entailing the principle of electrochemical oxidation of aryl rings has been utilized to relieve the strain of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane and further trap the molecular oxygen to deliver the 1,3&#8208;bifunctionalized product. Hence, the methodology bestows a novel route towards the scalable synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketones.







Abstract
An unprecedented external oxidant&#8208;free electrochemical protocol for 1, 3&#8208;oxohydroxylation of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane is disclosed. The strategy encompasses the activation of the labile &#960;&#8208;electron cloud of the aryl ring to cleave the strained Csp3&#8722;Csp3 bond of cyclopropane to afford the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketones via insertion of molecular oxygen. More significantly, based on the detailed mechanistic investigations and cyclic voltammetry experiments, a plausible mechanism is proposed.

A selective palladation: Planar and central chiral cyclophanyl&#8208;derived mono&#8208; and binuclear N,C&#8208;palladacycles are prepared by regioselective ortho&#8208;palladation of amine&#8208; and imine&#8208;functionalized [2.2]paracyclophanes employing stepwise Pd(OAc)2 and LiCl followed by modular treatment with PPh3, PCy3 and (Ph2PCH2)2.

Abstract
In this report, we describe a series of cyclophanyl&#8208;derived mono&#8208; and binuclear N,C&#8208;palladacycles by regioselective ortho&#8208;palladation of amine&#8208;functionalized [2.2]paracyclophanes. Employing Pd(OAc)2 followed by LiCl and with the subsequent modular treatment of Ph3P, Cy3P, and (Ph2PCH2)2, this strategy allows to prepare stable cyclophanyl&#8208;derived planar and central chiral N,C&#8208;palladacycles in a highly selective manner. The regioselective ortho&#8208;palladation mono&#8208; and bimetallic product formation was analyzed by detailed spectroscopic techniques, mass spectrometry and unambiguously confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis.

         <title>Bending Versus&#160;Twisting Acenes &#8211; A Computational Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widely used in organic electronic devices. The electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of PAHs can be tuned by structural modifications to the aromatic backbone to introduce an inherent distortion from planarity, such as bending or twisting. However, it remains difficult to isolate and control the effects of such distortions. Here, we sought to understand how backbone twisting and bending affect the electronic properties of acenes, as models for larger PAHs. We found that, even when highly distorted from planarity (30&#176; per ring), acenes maintain their aromatic character and &#960; orbital delocalization with minor mixing of the &#963; and &#960; orbitals. In addition, the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO decreases with increasing twist, while the gap is hardly affected by bending, since the energy of both orbitals increase to a similar extent. For bent acenes in the triplet state, the spin becomes more localized with increasing bend, whereas twisting produces an evenly distributed spin delocalization. These findings can guide the synthesis of PAHs with tailored properties.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widely used in organic electronic devices. The electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of PAHs can be tuned by structural modifications to the aromatic backbone to introduce an inherent distortion from planarity, such as bending or twisting. However, it remains difficult to isolate and control the effects of such distortions. Here, we sought to understand how backbone twisting and bending affect the electronic properties of acenes, as models for larger PAHs. We found that, even when highly distorted from planarity (30&#176; per ring), acenes maintain their aromatic character and &#960; orbital delocalization with minor mixing of the &#963; and &#960; orbitals. In addition, the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO decreases with increasing twist, while the gap is hardly affected by bending, since the energy of both orbitals increase to a similar extent. For bent acenes in the triplet state, the spin becomes more localized with increasing bend, whereas twisting produces an evenly distributed spin delocalization. These findings can guide the synthesis of PAHs with tailored properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thioureidocalix[6]arenes Pseudorotaxanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel calix[6]arene derivatives with phenylthioureido hydrogen&#8208;bond donor (HBD) groups appended at the upper rim were investigated. The number of HBD units affects the conformation of the macrocyclic hosts and their binding abilities towards bipyridinium&#8208;based guests, as a function of their counterions.







Abstract
Heteroditopic calix[6]arenes are extensively exploited as synthetic receptors and as molecular components of supramolecular threaded and interlocked structures. We describe the synthesis of two novel calix[6]arene macrocycles, the upper rim of which is functionalized with either two or three phenylthioureido groups. These moieties are excellent hydrogen&#8208;bond donors and largely affect the conformation of the macrocycle, both in solution and in the solid state. Alternate conformers are observed in solution, and they give rise to supramolecular chains in the solid state. Moreover, and because of this conformational freedom, also the recognition properties toward the formation of pseudorotaxanes with bipyridinium&#8208;based axles are strongly affected. The number of phenylthioureido units of the macrocyclic host and the nature of the counterions of the bipyridinium guest determine the stability of the complexes. NMR, UV&#8208;Vis and electrochemical measurements revealed that very stable 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complexes are formed between the triphenylthioureido calix[6]arene and a bipyridinium guest with tosylate counterions, whereas no complex is observed between the diphenylthioureido macrocycle and a hexafluorophosphate bipyridinium salt.

         <title>The Merger of Photocatalyzed Hydrogen Atom Transfer with Transition Metal Catalysis for C&#8208;H Functionalization of Alkanes and Cycloalkanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic C(sp  3  )&#8208;H functionalization can convert abundant feedstock hydrocarbons into value&#8208;added products in an atom and step economy manner and is a powerful tool in organic synthesis. However, the intrinsic chemical inertness of ubiquitous aliphatic C&#8208;H bonds of alkanes and cycloalkanes, makes their direct and selective functionalization extremely challenging. Recently, some elegant strategies have been developed to solve the problems based on the merger of photocatalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with transition metal catalysis. Light&#8208;induced HAT processes are employed to initiate the alkyl radical generation, which is synergistic with metal catalysis involving, for example nickel, copper, cobalt, cerium, chromium or manganese. The different metal catalysts provide redox adjustment, Lewis acid activation or other functionalities and tune the reactivity and selectivity of the radical&#8208;mediated sequences, allowing the development of diverse chemo&#8208;, site&#8208;, and/or stereoselective synthetic reactions. In this mini review, we offer a brief summary of the recent advances in dual photo&#8208;induced HAT and transition metal catalysis for C&#8208;H functionalization of alkanes and cycloalkanes. We expect that these methodologies will stimulate the applications in catalysis, pharmaceuticals and other related fields.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new metal&#8208;free hydrohalogenation method for alkynes has been developed, which proceeds through a pseudo&#8208;intramolecular process. In this reaction, ethynylaniline serves as a substrate to form an anilinium salt quantitatively upon treatment with hydrochloric acid. The spatial proximity facilitates the efficient electrophilic addition of HCl to the ethynyl group in  syn  &#8208;mode, affording the corresponding chloroalkene without overaddition. This protocol was applied to HBr and HI, and the corresponding bromo&#8208; and iodoalkenes were obtained, respectively. The obtained chloroalkene was converted to tri&#8208;substituted alkenes possessing different aryl/alkynyl groups  via  Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Transformation of Benzothiophenes by C&#8722;S Bond Cleavage Beyond Reductive Desulfurization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Skeleton reconstruction of benzothiophenes can be realized by directly endocyclic C&#8722;S bond cleavage. Description in this review also include the achievement with the oxidative derivatives of benzothiophene, such as sulfoxides, sulfones and S&#8208;ylides.







Abstract
As the analogues of indole bicyclic system, benzothiophenes are often overlooked in organic transformation, and synthetic methods developed mostly rely on the acidic protons at C2 or C3 position, known as C&#8722;H functionalization. Complementary to the structural modification of benzothiophenes, C&#8722;S bond cleavage can realize the skeleton reconstruction. Reduction of benzothiophenes always involves the C&#8722;S bond cleavage, especially in the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of petroleum products. Beyond reductive desulfurization, although C&#8722;S bond cleavage of benzothiophenes has been achieved by diverse methodologies, there is no systematic review on such topic. Herein, transformation of benzothiophenes via C&#8722;S bond cleavage in organic synthesis will be presented along with briefly delineated mechanism.

Complementary to the structural modification of benzothiophenes, C&#8722;S bond cleavage can realize the skeleton reconstruction. Reduction of benzothiophenes always involves the C&#8722;S bond cleavage, especially in the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of petroleum products. Beyond reductive desulfurization, although C&#8722;S bond cleavage of benzothiophenes has been achieved by diverse methodologies, there is no systematic review on such topic. Herein, transformation of benzothiophenes &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; C&#8722;S bond cleavage in organic synthesis will be presented along with briefly delineated mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;(R)&#8208;Sitagliptin by RhI&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydroamination</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise, asymmetric synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;(R)&#8208;Sitagliptin is presented utilizing a RhI/Josiphos&#8208;based hydroamination strategy as a key step beside allene preparation and amide coupling. The unusual &#946;&#8208;amino function was accomplished by an anti&#8208;Markovnikov selective Wacker oxidation and subsequent Pinnick oxidation. The synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;(R)&#8208;Sitagliptin proceeded over three isolated intermediates providing 3.5&#8197;mmol in an overall yield of 47&#8201;%.







Abstract
We report of a concise synthesis of (R)&#8208;sitagliptin monophosphate &#8211; a drug predominantly applied in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Utilizing our recently developed RhI&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of allenes for the stereoselective construction of the inherent chiral amino function, a new approach to (R)&#8208;sitagliptin monophosphate on a 3.5&#8197;mmol scale was established.

Sulfanyl groups in the former starting material turned out to behave like independent functions, while a mutual influence of the sulfur functions was verified in the latter compounds. A meaningful investigation was possible in the conformationally constrained dithiane derivative. Oxidation of the dithiane with stoichiometric amounts of periodate led to exclusive formation of bissulfoxides, while hydrogen peroxide and  meta  &#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid yielded the possible products less specifically and permanganate preferentially furnished sulfones. The experimental investigations were supported by calculations on energies and stereoelectronic effects of starting materials, products, and transition states. The unique property of permanganate to exclusively yield sulfones might be due to its special oxidation mechanism, where the sulfur is not only acting as nucleophile, but concomitantly as electrophilic moiety.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of some new extended polycyclic quinones was achieved through a one&#8208;pot procedure comprising the cycloaddition of benzocyclobutene and benzodicyclobutene derivatives with benzoquinone or naphthoquinone. Notably, a highly symmetrical nonacene&#8208;hexaone could be prepared, albeit in low yields (5&#8211;7&#8201;%).







Abstract
Quinones have widespread applications in view of their interesting chemical and photophysical features. On the other hand, benzocyclobutenes (BCBs) are generally masked reactive dienes suitable for the [4+2] cycloaddition reactions. Here, benzocyclobutenes and benzodicyclobutenes (BDCBs) were prepared and further reacted with benzoquinone and naphthoquinone in order to obtain some new polycyclic quinones with highly extended &#960; systems, namely, 6&#8208;bromo&#8208;5,8&#8208;dimethoxyanthracene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione, 2,9&#8208;dibromo&#8208;1,4,8,11&#8208;tetramethoxypentacene&#8208;6,13&#8208;dione, 9&#8208;bromo&#8208;7,10&#8208;dimethoxytetracene&#8208;5,12&#8208;dione, 3,10&#8208;dimethoxycyclobuta[b]anthracene&#8208;1,5,8(2H)&#8208;trione, 6,10,17,21&#8208;tetramethoxynonacene&#8208;1,4,8,12,15,19&#8208;hexaone, and 3,12&#8208;dimethoxycyclobuta[b]tetracene&#8208;1,5,10(2H)&#8208;trione. In addition to their spectroscopic characterization the new compounds are investigated by UV and fluorescence spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and DFT calculations.

         <title>Borane Catalyzed Redox Isomerization of 2&#8208;Amino Chalcones: Hydride Abstraction or Hydride Migration?</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The borane catalyzed redox isomerization of 2&#8208;amino chalocones was developed. Mechanistic investigations by kinetic, isotopic labelling, and competition experiments as well as computational studies corroborate the concerted [1,5] hydride shift as operative mechanism. The redox isomerization products are obtained in high yield and up to &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
The borane catalyzed redox isomerization of 2&#8208;amino chalcones was developed. The tetrahydroquinolines are obtained in high yield as a mixture of cis/trans diastereomers in a ratio of 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 to &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5. The reaction mechanism is investigated by mechanistic, kinetic, and computational methods, concluding that the reaction proceeds through concerted [1,5] hydride shift in contrast to borane&#8208;mediated C(sp3)&#8722;H hydride abstraction.

         <title>Porous Organic Compounds &#8211; Small Pores on the Rise</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous materials are important for various energy&#8208;related technologies such as catalysis and separation. While porous organic cage compounds are a rather recent addition to the field of porous materials, these discrete nanocavities have since emerged as a versatile functional&#8208;materials platform, facilitated by the solubility of the materials in common organic solvents. In contrast to other frameworks, organic cages are assembled first from modular building blocks in solution and then pack in the solid&#8208;state in a next step. In this minireview, we highlight examples of porous organic cages with focus on how the intrinsic nanopore can be controlled and utilised, especially focusing on their synthesis and the gas sorption properties of smaller intrinsic pores of porous organic cage compounds, porous macrocycles and other related compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanically Interlocked Molecules for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows an artistic rendition of a cell culture incorporating&#160;mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), illustrating different strategies in which they have been applied for biological and medical functions. MIMs have been used to create smart drugs and endow theranostic materials with advantageous properties. They have also been used to construct sensors for various biologically relevant targets. The special dynamic properties of rotaxanes have also been exploited to build transmembrane transporters. Another exciting avenue of research is the construction of functional mechanically interlocked protein&#8208; and DNA&#8208;structures. The authors would like to thank Dana Kauerhof for help with creating the graphic. More information can be found in the Minireview by J. Niemeyer et&#8197;al.

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Synthesis of a Hexapeptide by Fragment Coupling in a Ball Mill</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using solvent&#8208;less techniques such as ball milling, a hexapeptide was synthesized in gram scale without using any toxic solvents. To date, this hexapeptide is the largest precisely controlled amino acid sequence ever synthesized in a ball mill. This study paves the way to future developments for the synthesis of longer peptides (and proteins) by using ball milling.







Abstract
Synthesis of long peptides is generally considered as a challenge to peptide chemists, in addition to producing significant amounts of toxic waste, such as DMF. Here we show that using solvent&#8208;less methods, such as ball milling, enabled the production of the hexapeptide Boc&#8208;(Ala&#8208;Phe&#8208;Gly)2&#8208;OBn at the gram scale with high overall yield (77&#8201;%, 5 linear steps). This is the longest peptide chain synthesized in a ball mill to date, in which the amino acid sequence is precisely controlled. This study complements the current fundamental knowledge required to synthesize longer and more difficult peptide chains (or small proteins) by using peptide fragment couplings in a ball mill.

         <title>The current understanding of how 2D polymers grow photochemically</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2D polymers are a relatively new class of macromolecules. It is not astounding therefore that so far research focussed on how to provide access to this intriguing class of organic 2D materials, how to prove their existence, and how to assess their structural quality. Studies concerning the formation mechanism are comparatively scarce. We here collect and compare all the mechanistic information available and point towards research directions to be followed in order to advance mechanistic understanding and, thus, fast development of this field. Because the two current starting situations for the photochemical synthesis of 2D polymers are layered single crystals and monolayers, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), local vibration spectroscopy, e.g. tip enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), and Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM), e.g. low temperature Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy (LT STM) in ultra&#8208;high vacuum (UHV), but also Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), are the prominent analytical tools. With their advantages and shortcomings, they will therefore play an important role throughout this brief review&#8208;type article.</dc:description>

         <title>RNA Hydrolysis by Heterocyclic Amidines and Guanidines: Parameters Affecting Reactivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;Aminobenzimidazole  10  , although a weak catalyst in the monomeric state, is a successful building block for effective artificial ribonucleases. In an effort to identify new building blocks with improved catalytic potential, RNA cleavage by a variety of heterocyclic amidines and guanidines has been studied. In addition to p  K  a  values and steric effects, the energy difference between tautomeric forms seems to be another important parameter for catalysis. This information is available from quantum chemical calculations on higher levels, but semiempirical methods are sufficient to get a first estimate. According to this assumption, imidazoimidazol  18  , characterized by isoenergetic tautomeric forms, is superior to 2&#8208;aminoimidazol  6  , the best candidate among the simple compounds. By far the largest effects are seen with 2&#8208;aminoperimidine  24  which rapidly cleaves RNA even in the micromolar concentration range. The impressive reactivity, however, is related to a tendency of compound  24  to form polycationic aggregates which are the actual catalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Equilibrium constants for the formation of Wheland complexes from 1,3,5&#8208;tris(dialkylamino)benzenes and benzhydrylium ions (Ar  2  CH  +  )&#160;have been determined photometrically in dichloromethane&#160;at 20 &#176;C. The Lewis basicity of the ring carbons increases in the series trimorpholinobenzene &lt; tripiperidinobenzene &lt;tripyrrolidinobenzene.

Since the rates of the formation of the Wheland complexes are too high to be measured directly, they were calculated as the product of photometrically determined equilibrium constants and the rate constants for the reverse reactions, which were derived from the dynamic  1  H NMR spectra. The experimental equilibrium and rate constants were in good agreement with the results of DFT calculations, that show that the complexes are thermodynamically more stable than the ammonium ions formed by attack of the benzhydrylium ions at the amino group of the title compounds, which explains the exclusive formation of Wheland complexes in thermodynamically controlled reactions. With nucleophilicity parameters in the range 10 &lt;  N  &lt; 15 the triaminobenzenes have comparable nucleophilic reactivities as enamines, silyl ketene acetals as well as stabilized phosphonium&#8208; and sulfonium ylides.</dc:description>

         <title>B(C6F5)3&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroarylation of Aryl Alkynes for the Synthesis of 1,1&#8208;Diaryl and Triaryl Substituted Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new strategy for the synthesis of 1,1&#8208;diaryl and triarylsubstituted alkenes has been developed utilizing B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation of alkynes with phenols. The method provide a direct route to  ortho  &#8208;alkenylated phenols with both terminal and internal alkynes. The reactions show excellent regioselectivity, and especially, good stereoselectivity was observed for the hydroarylation of internal alkynes. Computational and experimental studies suggest that for the reaction of internal alkynes and phenols, an acid&#8208;catalyzed isomerization mechanism involving two tertiary carbonium ion intermediates is responsible for the formation of  Z&#8208;triaryl substituted alkenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigating the individual importance of the Pam2Cys ester motifs on TLR2 activity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>TLR2 agonists are at the forefront of vaccine research for a plethora of diseases, in particular they offer a promising tool for the treatment of cancer. A detailed knowledge of their structure&#8208;activity relationships informs the methodical design of vaccine constructs that include TLR2 agonists. Herein we report the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of analogues of the TLR2 agonist Pam 2 Cys to further probe structure&#8208;activity relationships. These analogues replace one or other of the two ester groups with ether functionalities to elucidate the role of the carbonyls on TLR2 activity. Through this we demonstrate that the C3 ester carbonyl is dispensable, but the C2 carbonyl is essential for activity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Samarium diiodide (SmI  2  ) is a versatile single electron transfer (SET) reagent in organic synthesis. The advantages of SmI  2  arise from various additive induced tailoring of a reaction to obtain a desired product in a stereoselective fashion. In most instances, this reagent is used in stoichiometric amount, and this poses a significant environmental issue limiting a broader applicability of SmI  2  . Despite challenges in the developments of catalytic methods, recent studies have paved the way for catalytic strategies rejuvenating the applications of SmI  2  in synthetic organic chemistry. This review aims to summarize different methods that are used to develop catalytic reactions of SmI  2  . A comparison of different approaches and future outlook of this field are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>A Continuous&#8208;Flow Route to Enantioenriched 3&#8208;Substituted&#8208;3&#8208;Hydroxyoxindoles: Organocatalytic Aldol Reactions of Isatin with Acetone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first continuous flow synthesis of 3&#8208;substituted&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxyoxindoles, providing a safer and seamless way for accelerating the isatin&#8208;acetone reaction at higher temperatures without compromising enantioselectivity is reported. Kamlet&#8208;Taft basicity (&#946;) and proticity (&#945;) of solvents were found to be crucial in describing the solubility of isatin and performance of L&#8208;leucinol organocatalyst and informed the choice of solvent for transfer to flow.







Abstract
An efficient L&#8208;leucinol catalysed asymmetric synthesis of 3&#8208;substitued&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxyoxindoles was for the first time completed under continuous flow, providing a safer route for accelerating the reaction at higher temperatures without adversely affecting enantioselectivity. Initial batch solvent screening of the isatin&#8208;acetone aldol reaction revealed neat acetone as the media best suited in flow as it dissolved isatin and afforded (S)&#8208;enantiomer of the adduct in 84&#8201;% ee. Solvents with Kamlet&#8208;Taft basicity (&#946;)&gt;0.6 and proticity (&#945;)&#8776;0 had a higher solubility of isatin but poor reaction performance while solvents with &#946;&lt;0.2 and &#945;&lt;0.6 performed excellently in the reaction albeit with poor isatin solubility. The addition of 10 equivalents of water improved the neat reaction to afford 94&#8201;% yield in 93&#8201;% ee at 20&#8201;&#176;C after 48&#8197;h. When transferred to continuous flow, complete conversion was observed in 12&#8197;h residence time at 40&#8201;&#176;C without loss in enantioselectivity. Further substrate studies in flow were undertaken with a 4&#8208;fold dilution and a 60&#8201;&#176;C reaction temperature required for some derivatives. Excellent yields and enantioselectivities were obtained in most cases.

         <title>Enantioselective addition of sodium bisulfite to nitroalkenes. A convenient approach to chiral sulfonic acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An enantioselective organocatalytic addition of sodium bisulfite to (  E  )&#8208;nitroalkenes has been developed catalyzed by a chiral bifunctional organocatalyst. The present methodology provides a variety of chiral &#946;&#8208;nitroethanesulfonic acid compounds (17 examples) with excellent results: up to 99% yield and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 96% ee). The reaction tolerates (hetero)aryl and alkyl substituents on the &#946;&#8208;nitroalkenes, and &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted nitroalkenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective aldol and conjugate addition reactions mediated by proline&#8208;based catalysts and its analogues: A concise review</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of amino acids and small peptides as asymmetric organocatalysts in the aldol and conjugate addition reactions is a major breakthrough in past decade. The desired stereoselectivity in these reactions can be attained through tunable elements of diversity present in the amino acids/peptides. On this note, the current review highlights the organocatalytic aldol and conjugate addition by proline or its analogous in the form of amide/peptide derivatives. The wide&#8208;ranging literatures are classified based on the use of single amino acid or peptides as catalyst. The designing of aforementioned amide/amino acid/peptide catalyst including their recent applications are also detailed. Moreover, the analogous catalysts embedding other hetero&#8208;organic functionalities which mimic the catalytic activity of proline in aldol/conjugate additions are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Multicomponent Domino Approaches for Synthesis of Spirooxazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thiones and Spirooxothiolane&#8208;2&#8208;imines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling the reactivity of ambident nucleophiles, nitrogen and sulfur as in an isothiocyanate by fine tuning the reaction parameters is a challenge in organic synthesis. A one pot multi&#8208;component protocol is described herein as an approach for construction of spirooxazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thiones and spirooxothiolane&#8208;2&#8208;imines. In DBU mediated reaction, isatin, phenyl acetylenes, and aryl isothiocyanates undergo hydrothiolation whereas aliphatic isothiocyanates undergo hydroamination. In presence of strong base (NaOH) isothiocyanates yield exclusively hydrothiolation. This domino approach proceeds by the addition and 5&#8208;  exo dig  cyclization  via  hydroamination/hydrothiolation, involves consecutive C&#8208;C, C&#8208;O and C&#8208;N/ C&#8208;S bond formations, further corroborated by DFT studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Compounds Combining a Macrocyclic Building Block and Flexible Side&#8208;Arms as Carbohydrate Receptors: Syntheses and Structure&#8208;Binding Activity Relationship Studies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;binding activity relationship studies with compounds consisting of a macrocyclic building block and flexible side&#8208;arms revealed the essential role of the side&#8208;arms in achieving strong complexation of all&#8208;equatorial substituted sugars, such as &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranoside.







Abstract
A series of new representatives of compounds combining a macrocyclic building block and flexible side&#8208;arms were prepared and their ability to act as carbohydrate receptors evaluated. The target compounds were obtained by multi&#8208;step syntheses, which included the preparation of numerous precursors as well as the isolation of a large number of by&#8208;products. The structure&#8208;binding activity relationship studies comprise, in particular, the variation of the side&#8208;arms in order to demonstrate the importance of the presence of a hydrogen bond donor in these units for the effective complexation of carbohydrates. Based on the findings of our previous studies, the variation of the bridge units is limited to benzene&#8208; and pyrrole&#8208;based moieties, whereby the use of the last&#8208;mentioned bridge type was expected to produce more effective systems. This assumption was confirmed by 1H NMR titrations and isothermal titration calorimetry.

         <title>Asymmetric Organocatalysis Accelerated via Self&#8208;Assembled Minimal Structures</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembling minimalistic peptides embedded with an organocatalytic moiety were designed and tested in a Michael reaction as a proof of concept for accelerated organocatalysis.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembling minimalistic peptides embedded with an organocatalytic moiety were designed. By controlling the formation of fibrils via external intervention, it was shown that the activation is accelerated when the organocatalyst is in its supramolecular state. The effect of the accelerated catalysis was demonstrated in a Michael benchmark reaction.

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Diaminoxylosides via Iodosulfonamidation of Xylal Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The power of iodosulfonamidation of glycals was used for the synthesis of 2,4&#8208;diaminoxylosides, which are of interest as conformational switches. The synthetic pathway proceeds from an l&#8208;arabino configuration over a glycal with two stereocenters in a threo relation to the d&#8208;xylo configuration of the product with compelling selectivity.







Abstract
d&#8208;Xylose is a special monosaccharide found in various organisms, which is characterized by conformational dynamics between different pyranose ring forms depending on the substitution pattern. With a perspective to study the conformational equilibria of xylosides and eventually use them as conformational switches, we sought an entry into a flexible synthesis of 2,4&#8208;diamino&#8208;xylosides. In particular, we synthesized 4&#8208;bromophenyl 2,4&#8208;diamino&#8208;3&#8208;O&#8208;(4&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;xyloside from l&#8208;arabinose utilizing a concomitant epimerization and differentiation at position 4 and iodosulfonamidation of a difunctional xylal at a later stage of the synthetic pathway. This strategy provides xylose derivatives with high stereochemical precision and a high degree of functionalization. The obtained xylose derivatives are of interest as conformational hinge molecules and as orthogonally protected triamino scaffold molecules.

In particular, we synthesized 4-bromophenyl 2,4-diamino-3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-(4-bromophenyl)-&#946;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-xyloside from &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-arabinose utilizing a concomitant epimerization and differentiation at position 4 and iodosulfonamidation of a difunctional xylal at a later stage of the synthetic pathway. This strategy provides xylose derivatives with high stereochemical precision and a high degree of functionalization. The obtained xylose derivatives are of interest as conformational hinge molecules and as orthogonally protected triamino scaffold molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Synthesis of an underrepresented buckybowl is described, including a description of its potent reactivities. The key to success is to readily prepare a tetra&#8208;brominated and highly&#8208;distorted precursor of dibenzo[g,p]chrysenes. The precursor undertook intra&#8208;molecular cyclization to form double pentagons, giving a gram&#8208;scale buckybowl skeleton, namely diindeno(1,2,3,4&#8208;defg:1&#8217;,2&#8217;,3&#8217;,4&#8217;&#8208;mnop)chrysene.







Abstract
Preparative synthesis of a new, soluble, and functionalized buckybowl is described. The precursor of dibenzo[g,p]chrysene having four bromine atoms at two fjord regions undertook palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization to afford a skeletal buckybowl, namely, diindeno(1,2,3,4&#8208;defg:1&#8217;,2&#8217;,3&#8217;,4&#8217;&#8208;mnop)chrysene. The resulting curved scaffold possesses two important substituents: four&#8208;fold alkyls increasing solubility and four&#8208;fold methoxy groups that could be further functionalized. These two features, coupled with the gently curved &#960;&#8208;system, enable general access to solution&#8208;compatible and multi&#8208;functional buckybowl molecules.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Norbornadienes via in&#8197;situ Cracking of Dicyclopentadiene Using Continuous Flow Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient synthesis of norbornadienes (NBDs) was achieved using flow chemistry via a combination of two reactions in one step. In situ cracking of dicyclopentadiene followed by Diels Alder reaction with alkynes in a flow chemistry setup with back&#8208;pressure regulator (BPR) make larger quantities of the norbornadienes (NBD)&#8208;quadricyclane (QC) photoswitch pair accessible.







Abstract
The norbornadiene (NBD)&#8208;quadricyclane (QC) photoswitch has recently attracted attention due to its use in molecular solar thermal energy systems (MOST). Normally for device testing, several grams are needed. One way of synthesizing NBDs efficiently is through the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between alkynes and cyclopentadiene. However, scaling up the reaction can be troublesome in a research lab environment. Also, dicyclopentadiene needs cracking before utilization which is a time&#8208;consuming step. Here, we developed a method where we both scale up the synthesis in a single reaction step that involves both in&#8197;situ cracking of dicyclopentadiene and the direct reaction of cyclopentadiene with acetylene derivatives using a tubular coiled stainless steel flow reactor. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we synthesized six different NBD compounds and scaled the synthesis to produce 87&#8197;g of a novel NBD in 9&#8197;h. The NBD is further characterized, showing promising properties for MOST applications. Our new method shows that flow chemistry is an attractive technique for the fast and efficient synthesis of large quantities of NBDs, needed to develop future real&#8208;life devices and applications.

         <dc:description>A new procedure for the synthesis of aryl methyl sulfides from dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and arylsulfonyl chlorides has been achieved. In this strategy, DMC plays dual role as both C1 building block and green solvent. Arylsulfonyl chlorides served as the sulfur precursors, and a variety of aryl methyl sulfides were obtained in moderate to excellent yields with good functional group tolerance. Additionally, alkylsulfonyl chloride and dibenzyl carbonate are proven to be suitable substrates as well.</dc:description>

         <title>Regiochemical Effects on the Carbohydrate Binding and Selectivity of Flexible Synthetic Carbohydrate Receptors with Indole and Quinoline Heterocyclic Groups</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic carbohydrate receptors (SCRs) that bind cell&#8208;surface carbohydrates could be used for disease detection, drug&#8208;delivery, and therapeutics, or for the site&#8208;selective modification of complex carbohydrates but their potential has not been realized because of remaining challenges associated with binding affinity and substrate selectivity. We have reported recently a series of flexible SCRs based upon a biaryl core with four pendant heterocyclic groups that bind glycans selectively through noncovalent interactions. Here we continue to explore the role of heterocycles on substrate selectivity by expanding our library to include a series of indole and quinoline heterocycles that vary in their regiochemistry of attachment to the biaryl core. The binding of these SCRs to a series of biologically&#8208;relevant carbohydrates was studied by 1H NMR titrations in CD2Cl2 and density&#8208;functional theory calculations. We find SCR030, SCR034 and SCR037 are selective, SCR031, SCR032, and SCR039 are strong binders, and SCR033, SCR035, SCR036, and SCR038 are promiscuous and bind weakly. Computational analysis reveals the importance of C&#8722;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;&#960; and H&#8208;bonding interactions in defining the binding properties of these new receptors. By combining these data with those obtained from our previous studies on this class of flexible SCRs, we develop a series of design rules that account for the binding of all SCRs of this class and anticipate the binding of future, not&#8208;yet imagined tetrapodal SCRs.</dc:description>

         <title>How Lewis Acids Catalyze Ene Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic effect of various Lewis acids (LAs) on the ene reaction between propene (ene) and but&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;one (enophile) was studied quantum chemically using density functional theory and with coupled&#8208;cluster theory. The studied LAs efficiently accelerate the ene reaction by lowering the reaction barrier up to 12 kcal mol &#8211;1 compared to the uncatalyzed reaction. Our detailed activation strain and Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital analyses reveal that coordination of a LA catalyst to the enophile decreases the reaction barrier of the ene reaction by inducing an asymmetry in the &#960;&#8208;electronic system, which increases the asynchronicity and hence relieves the otherwise highly destabilizing activation strain and Pauli repulsion between the closed&#8208;shell filled p&#8208;orbitals of the ene and enophile. In all, these findings further demonstrate the generality of the Pauli&#8208;lowering catalysis concept.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective Mannich reaction of  &#945;  &#8208;acetoxy&#8208;  &#946;  &#8208;keto esters with isatin imine has been developed. The quinine thiourea organocatalyst smoothly promoted the asymmetric Mannich reaction to furnish various 3&#8208;substituted&#8208;3&#8208;aminooxindole derivatives bearing two adjacent tetra&#8208;substituted stereocenters in up to 93% yield, up to 98%  ee  with &gt;20:1  dr  . The transition state structure and absolute configuration of the obtained product has been predicted using DFT calculations and results from single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis are in agreement with the DFT studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Controlled Chemoselective Synthesis of Thiosulfonates and Thiocyanates: Novel Reactivity of KXCN (X = S, Se) Towards Organosulfonyl Chlorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient chemoselective protocol has been developed for the synthesis of thiosulfonates and thiocyanates by employing cost effective and commercially available organosulfonyl chlorides with potassium thio&#8208;/selenocyanate. The strategy offered the thiosulfonates and thiocyanates selectively by tuning the equivalents of KSeCN and optimizing the reaction temperature. On the other hand, thiosulfonates were obtained as sole products when organosulfonyl chlorides treated with KSCN. Furthermore, synthesis of diarylthioethers and aryl(heteroaryl) thioethers were carried out as a part of synthetic application of newly prepared arylthiocyanates.</dc:description>

         <title>A comprehensive study of the Ca2+ ion binding of fluorescently labelled BAPTA analogues</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since its development, the ionophore BAPTA (1,2&#8209;bis(2&#8209;aminophenoxy)&#8208;ethane&#8209;N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8209;tetraacetic&#160;acid) has been used unchanged in calcium sensing applications. In this work we present a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study of novel alterations in the structure of BAPTA, with a focus on the systematic modification of the chain connecting the two aromatic rings of the molecule (denoted as &#8220;linker&#8221;). A bis&#8208;(diethylamino)xantene fluorophore was also attached to the structures in a fixed position and the structure&#8208;fluorescence response relationship of these molecules was investigated in addition. The effect of the length of the linker, the number of O atoms in this chain and even the removal of one of the rings was tested; these all proved to significantly alter the characteristics of the compounds. For example, it was found that the second aromatic ring of BAPTA is not essential for the turn&#8208;on of the fluorescence. We also demonstrated that successful sensing can be realized even by replacing the chain with a single oxygen atom, which suggests the availability of a new calcium binding mode of the chelator. The reliable turn&#8208;on characteristic, the steep Ca  2+  fluorescence titration curve and the intense fluorescence emission combine to make this compound a prospective candidate as a calcium sensing molecular probe in diagnostic neurobiological applications.</dc:description>

Recoverable hybrid materials for heterogeneous enantioselective organocatalyzed Michael addition reaction. Developed through the ready intercalation of &#945;&#8208;amino acids and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dipeptides into reconstructed hydrotalcite (Mg/Al) by means of sustainable technics such as mechanochemical and ultrasound activation. The conjugate addition of aldehydes to maleimides under mild and solvent free conditions proceeded with high yield and excellent enantioselectivity up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 e.r.







Abstract
In this work, a series of &#945;&#8208;amino acids (L&#8208;Phe, D&#8208;Phe, L&#8208;Trp) and several &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dipeptides (H2N&#8208;L&#8208;Val&#8208;N&#8208;Bn&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Ala&#8208;COOH and H2N&#8208;L&#8208;Leu&#8208;N&#8208;Bn&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Ala&#8208;COOH) intercalated into hydrotalcite (Mg/Al, x=0.333) were prepared by high speed ball milling (HSBM) assisted rehydration/reconstruction methods, followed by sonication and mechanical stirring. All organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid samples were characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and FTIR&#8208;ATR spectroscopy. The catalytic activity of the resulting hydrotalcite&#8208;supported materials (natural and hybrid) was evaluated in the asymmetric Michael addition reaction of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;aldehydes to N&#8208;substituted&#8208;maleimides. Pristine (HTS), calcined (HTC) and water&#8208;reconstructed (HTR&#8208;l) hydrotalcite&#8208;derived materials exhibited very low catalytic activities, affording racemic mixtures of the anticipated Michael adduct. By contrast, hybrid materials showed better activities, especially HTR&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid catalysts afforded Michael products in up to 94&#8201;% yield and with rather high enantioselectivity (enantiomeric ratio (e.r.) up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1) at room temperature under neat reaction conditions. The effect of solvents and Br&#248;nsted basic or acidic additives was evaluated using the best hybrid catalyst, HTR&#8208;L&#8208;Phe. In addition, recycling and reuse of the catalyst (up to 4 cycles) and large&#8208;scale experiments was successfully carried out.

         <title>Ammonium Chloride&#8208;Promoted Rapid Synthesis of Monosubstituted Ureas under Microwave Irradiation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monosubstituted ureas are important scaffolds in organic chemistry. They appear in various biologically active compounds and serve as versatile precursors in synthesis. Monosubstituted ureas were originally prepared using toxic and hazardous phosgene equivalents. Modern methods include transamidation of urea and nucleophilic addition to cyanate salts, both of which suffer from a narrow substrate scope due to the need for a strong acid and prolonged reaction times. We hereby report that ammonium chloride can promote the reaction between amines and potassium cyanate to generate monosubstituted ureas in water. This method proceeds rapidly under microwave irradiation and tolerates a broad range of functional groups. Unlike previous strategies, it is compatible with other nucleophiles, acid&#8208;labile moieties and most of the common protecting groups. The products precipitate out of solution, allowing facile isolation without column chromatography.</dc:description>

         <title>Emerging building blocks for medicinal chemistry: recent synthetic advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current medicinal chemistry relies heavily on the quality of building blocks, i.e. reagents used to introduce chemical diversity into the target molecules. The last decade witnessed an emergence of many novel (or well&#8208;overlooked old) chemotypes for drug discovery, which is related to adapting new synthetic methodologies, designing new  sp3&#8208;enriched bioisosteres, paying attention to previously underrated (or even unwanted) structural motifs, or combination thereof. In this review with 532 references, a survey of selected chemotypes that emerged recently in medicinal chemistry is provided, with a focus on the synthesis of the corresponding building blocks. Thus, saturated (hetero)aliphatic boronates, sulfonyl fluorides, sulfinates, non&#8208;classical  sp3&#8208;enriched benzene isosteres, bicyclic morpholine/piperidine/piperazine analogs, as well as  gem&#8208;difluorinated cycloalkanes (as an example of emerging fluorinated motifs) are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkylation of Electron&#8208;Deficient Olefins through Conjugate Addition of Organozinc Reagents: An Update</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the efficient reactions related to alkylation of electron&#8208;deficient olefins through the conjugate addition of organozinc reagents, including their advantages, limitations, and possibilities for improvement. Both asymmetric and non&#8208;asymmetric conjugate additions are highlighted. Cyclic and acyclic enones, enals, &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes have been used as electron&#8208;deficient olefins.







Abstract
This review focuses on the applications of organozinc reagents in conjugate addition reactions. Organozinc compounds are a class of organometallic reagent used in various reactions such as addition, substitution, and coupling reactions. The conjugate addition or 1, 4&#8208;addition is one of the most useful bond forming strategies used in organic synthesis since broad range of nucleophiles can be employed in the reaction. Addition of organozinc to electron&#8208;deficient olefins attracts synthetic chemists as it preferably undergoes conjugate addition over 1,2&#8208;addition unlike other organometallic reagents, such as Grignard reagent or organolithium. Many natural products were also synthesized by applying the conjugate addition reaction of organozinc. Moreover, organozinc reagents have superior functional group compatibility and can be easily prepared relative to other organometallic compounds. Consequently, conjugate additions of organozinc reagents were highly studied and having a review on it is very important at present. Though a few reviews are available, they either do not focus directly on the organozinc reagents or not on the conjugate addition. We hope that this review article will be of great use to organic researchers.

         <title>Synthesis of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Bipyridines through Catalytic C&#8722;C Bond Formations from C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview describes the recent developments in the preparation of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridines by C&#8722;H bond dimerization of pyridines, C&#8722;H bond heteroarylation of activated pyridines, and late&#8208;stage functionalization of 2,2&#8208;pyridine scaffolds.







Abstract
The present review describes the homogenous catalytic methodologies for the synthesis of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridines involving C&#8722;C bond formation from C&#8722;H bond. There are three main approaches to build well&#8208;decorated 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridines from C&#8722;H bond cleavage: i) the formation of C2&#8722;C2&#8242; bond by the dimerization of (activated) pyridines, ii) the C&#8722;H bond heteroarylation of activated pyridine, or iii) the late&#8208;stage functionalization of (activated) 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridines including photoredox processes. Besides the scope and limitation of each methodologies, the relevant mechanisms of reaction are also discussed.

         <title>N&#8208;Confused Pyritriphyrin: A New Class of Triphyrin and its Calixphyrin Analogue</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The N&#8208;confused pyritriphyrin(3.3.1) was synthesized by switching the bonding mode of subpyriporphyrin with inclusion of two o &#8208;phenylene rings in the macrocyclic core and prevails nonaromatic character due to the local aromatic characteristic of the embedded 3,5&#8208;diphenylpyridyl unit. The simplest contracted derivative of N&#8208;confused pyricalixphyrin such as calix[2]phyrin(2.2. 1.1.1 ) is mainly achieved; (a) along with N&#8208;confused pyritriphyrin; (b) by changing the reaction condition and (c) from N&#8208;confused pyritriphyrin by using simple reducing agent. The conversion of N&#8208;confused pyritriphyrin to respective calixphyrin analogue was elusive so far. The molecular structure of calixphyrin is unambiguously confirmed by crystal analysis which reveals its partial ruffled conformation with exclusively amine pyrrole units in the macrocyclic core in spite of steric congestion, which is unprecedented to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Open&#8208;Cage Fullerenes with Pyrrole, Pyrrolone, Pyridinone, Iminofuran, and Pyranone Fragments Embedded on the Rim of the Orifice</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The open&#8208;cage fullerene with a keto&#8208;lactone moiety reacted with aniline to form open&#8208;cage fullerenes with various functional groups on the rim of the expanded orifice. Decarbonylation and decarboxylation process took place under milder conditions compared to those for classical organic compounds. One water molecule could be trapped in the cavity of the new open&#8208;cage compounds as revealed by NMR and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data.







Abstract
An open&#8208;cage fullerene derivative with a pyranone and a diiminopentanone moiety was prepared. Further reaction with aniline could convert the pyranone moiety into a pyrrole moiety through the pyridinone moiety as an intermediate. During the process, decarboxylation and dehydroxylation aromatization reactions also took place on the diiminopentanone moiety and the two adjacent hydroxyl groups, thus forming iminofuran or pyrrolone moiety on the rim of the open&#8208;cage fullerene. Protonation experiment showed that the imino nitrogen atom on the rim of the orifice is more basic than the pyrrole nitrogen atom. The lone pair of the pyrrole nitrogen is partially conjugated with the &#960; system of the fullerene cage as shown by single crystal X&#8208;ray structures.

         <title>HFIP&#8208;Promoted Substitution in the Ferrocene Series: Smooth Approach towards Original Catalysts**
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudo&#8208;benzylic substitution promoted by fluorinated solvent from various iodoferrocenes is described. These new reaction conditions allow the fast generation of libraries of derivatives for applications in catalysis for example, as demonstrated with the synthesis of original ligands used in cross&#8208;coupling reactions.







Abstract
Pseudo&#8208;benzylic substitution is an important reaction in the ferrocene series, especially to obtain ligands for catalysis. Herein, we described new reactions conditions, using fluorinated alcohols as both solvent and promoter, able to deliver iodoferrocene derivatives faster than using classical solvents. Various N, O, P and C&#8208;nucleophiles were found compatible with this transformation which occurs with full retention of stereochemistry. Original P,N&#8208;ligands were prepared by using iodine/lithium exchange&#8208;chlorophoshine trapping sequences, and their properties were evaluated in Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura and Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig coupling as well as in ketone &#945;&#8208;arylation reaction.

         <dc:description>We have developed a practical, general protocol for denitration of readily available &#945;&#8208;nitroketones with sulfur and amines to access a broad range of &#945;&#8208;ketothioamides under mild conditions.

         <title>A 2000 to 2020 Practitioner&#8217;s Guide to Chiral Amine Based Enantioselective Aldol Reactions:Common Ketone Substrates,Best Methods,in Water Reaction Environments,and Defining Nuances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We begin with an extensive introduction for the non&#8208;expert regarding enantioselective, amine catalyzed, aldol reactions (Sections 1&#8208;3). There, a broad prospective is provided regarding: methodology limitations, mechanism, in water versus on water definitions and their theoretical basis, small&#8208; and large&#8208;scale physical&#8208;mechanical aspects, solid versus liquid starting material considerations, reproducibility, ball milling, diketone substrates, etc. The thematic emphasis then turns to practical outcomes for the reaction of nineteen aliphatic, cyclic, and aromatic ketones with 4&#8208;nitrobenzaldehyde and benzaldehyde prior to 2021. The ketone substrates are listed in Section 4 of the TOC and their structures are shown in Figure 1. Each ketone is linked to a summary defined by a: (i) schematic, (ii) text summary, (iii) catalyst Figures, and (iv) tabular reaction/product data. Individual ketone summaries, at times, represent the distillation of over six hundred research articles, and the data refinement and its tabular reconstitution is not reproducible using a chemical database search with filters. In the review&#8217;s broadest use, the Figure 1 ketone structures serve as templates to extrapolate to a hypothetical substrate holding more functionality, but of related steric and electronic similarity. This pseudo matching permits a rapid answer to, &#8220;Does this methodology suit the ketone substrate at hand or not?&#8221; In a positive outcome, the best reaction conditions (stoichiometry, catalyst structure and loading, solvent, time, etc.) to affect aldol product formation (yield, dr, and ee) are delineated. A second envisioned use allows the directed construction of diketone substrates (after viewing the tabularized data of Section 4), which then undergo regioselective mono&#8208;aldol product formation. This tactic, reacting one carbonyl moiety while the other remains unreacted, avoids ketone protection&#8208;deprotection, and is shown for the advantageous synthesis of an Alzheimer drug candidate.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Diverse Seleno&#8208;Glycolipids via the Transacetalization of Selenoacetals</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seleno&#8208;glycolipids are attractive detergents for X&#8208;ray structural studies of membrane proteins. To expand the scope of available seleno&#8208;glycolipids, we established a facile synthesis toward novel mono&#8208; and diseleno&#8208;glycolipids with various glycan and lipid moieties; this proceeds via transacetalization of selenoacetals and glycosyl imidates. This work demonstrates the first synthesis of diseleno&#8208;glycolipids.







Abstract
Seleno&#8208;glycolipids, in which glycosidic oxygens are replaced with selenium atoms, are attractive detergents for X&#8208;ray structural studies of membrane proteins. However, the development of seleno&#8208;glycolipids has been hampered by difficulties associated with their chemical syntheses. In this study, we report a facile synthesis of novel seleno&#8208;glycolipids with various glycan and lipid moieties, which proceeds via transacetalization of selenoacetals and glycosyl imidates. This work not only provides a route to monoseleno&#8208;glycolipids, but also demonstrates the first synthesis of diseleno&#8208;glycolipids.

         <title>Synthesis of Symmetrical and Unsymmetrical Thiosulfonates from Disulfides via Electrochemical Induced Disulfide Bond Metathesis and Site&#8208;Selective Oxidation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical, oxidative generation of symmetrical and unsymmetrical thiosulfonates is presented. First, the oxidation of disulfides yielding symmetrical thiosulfonates was realised. The direct synthesis is performed using a simple quasi&#8208;divided cell design, whereby the usage of a supporting electrolyte is unnecessary. Its principle was then expanded to the conversion of unsymmetrical disulfides that were in situ generated via metathesis of two symmetrical disulfides. This enables a direct access to unsymmetrical thiolsulfonates without any pre&#8208;functionalisation or elaborate synthesis of the starting materials for the first time. The scope of the reaction was investigated by converting different functionalised aliphatic and aromatic disulfides in moderate to very good yields. Furthermore, a sensitivity assessment for an improved reproducibility and a robustness screen to determine the compatibility of the reaction against functional groups were performed.</dc:description>

Its principle was then expanded to the conversion of unsymmetrical disulfides that were in situ generated via metathesis of two symmetrical disulfides. This enables a direct access to unsymmetrical thiolsulfonates without any pre-functionalisation or elaborate synthesis of the starting materials for the first time. The scope of the reaction was investigated by converting different functionalised aliphatic and aromatic disulfides in moderate to very good yields. Furthermore, a sensitivity assessment for an improved reproducibility and a robustness screen to determine the compatibility of the reaction against functional groups were performed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Promoted Glycosylation for the Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;Glycosyl Sulfonyl Amides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycosyl sulfonyl amides are synthesized in a self&#8208;promoted N&#8208;glycosylation with high &#946;&#8208;selectivity and in high yields. Armed and disarmed glycosyl donors of different size and with different protective groups react smoothly with sulfonyl amides, such as protected asparagine derivatives. Influence of solvents, concentration, temperature and stoichiometry is studied.







Abstract
N&#8208;Glycosyl N&#8208;sulfonyl amides have been synthesized by a self&#8208;promoted glycosylation, i.&#8201;e. without any catalysts, promotors or additives. When the reactions were carried out at lower temperatures a mixture of N&#8208; and O&#8208;glycosides were observed, where the latter rearranged to give the &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;glycosides at elevated temperatures. By this method sulfonylated asparagine derivatives can be selectively &#946;&#8208;glycosylated in high yields by trichloroacetimidate glycosyl donors of different reactivity including protected glucosamine derivatives. The chemoselectivity in the glycosylations as well as the rearrangements from O&#8208;glycosides to &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;glycosides gives information of the glycosylation mechanism. This method gives access to glycosyl sulfonyl amides under mild conditions.

         <title>Lewis&#8208;Acid&#8208;Catalyzed (3+2)&#8208;Cycloadditions of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes with Thioketenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of dialkyl 2&#8208;methylidene tetrahydrothiophene&#8208;3,3&#8208;dicarboxylates was prepared from (tert&#8208;butyl)iso&#8208;propyl thioketene via Lewis acid catalyzed (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition with D&#8208;A cyclopropanes. In all studied cases the (Z)&#8208;diastereoisomer was found as the main product.







Abstract
The reactivity of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) cyclopropanes towards thioketenes was investigated. In a (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition using Sc(OTf)3 as a Lewis acidic catalyst, the corresponding exocyclic thioenol ethers (2&#8208;methylidene tetrahydrothiophenes) were formed in moderate to good yields. Unsymmetrical thioketenes provided E/Z mixtures at the double bond, with the Z isomer being preferred.

         <dc:description>
This minireview presents recent examples of mechanically interlocked structures for biological and medical applications. Topics discussed include smart drugs, theranostics, sensing of medically relevant species, as well as protein&#8208; and DNA engineering. Utilizing the unique properties of the mechanical bond to construct functional systems for biomedical applications can serve as a paradigm for further developments in these fields.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) carry great potential in different fields of chemistry, based on their specific structures, their internal dynamics, their stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior, and other unique features of the mechanical bond. This minireview presents some of the most recent developments in their use for medical and biological applications. For example, they have been used to influence, enhance or block the action of therapeutic agents to enable targeted drug delivery. The dynamic structural properties have been used to generate switches and transporters, as well as sensors for various medically relevant species. Building MIMs by incorporating biomolecules like DNA and proteins has served as a novel way to control their properties.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Polymer Bioconjugates Prepared by Post&#8208;Polymerization Modification of Alternating Copolymers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward strategy is proposed for the synthesis of protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugates using one of the oldest polymers, the poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride). Different poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) copolymers were successfully prepared by RAFT polymerization in dioxane using the 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;propyl dodecyl trithiocarbonate as chain transfer agent (CTA) and AIBN as initiator. Original biomacromolecules were successfully prepared by post&#8208;polymerization modification.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugates have shown great promise in biomedical and life science applications including drug delivery and diagnosis. The current bioconjugation strategies suffer from lack of efficiency and versatility. In this article, poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) copolymers were first prepared by RAFT polymerization and characterized by different analytical techniques. Then, the poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) precursors were functionalized with primary amine such as azidopropylamine and amino poly(ethylene glycol). The reaction of amino compounds with maleic anhydride was found to be a highly efficient, a versatile, and a facile chemical ligation reaction for the synthesis of macromolecules with quantitative yield under mild conditions. The main benefit is the incorporation of a wide range of functionality by easily changing the primary amine compound. For the amphiphilic graft copolymers based on poly(ethylene glycol), aggregation behavior in water was investigated. In a second part, azido&#8208;functionalized polystyrene copolymers were used to prepare a new protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugate by copper&#8208;free click chemistry reaction.

Different poly(styrene-&lt;i&gt;alt&lt;/i&gt;-maleic anhydride) copolymers were successfully prepared by RAFT polymerization in dioxane using the 2-cyano-2-propyl dodecyl trithiocarbonate as chain transfer agent (CTA) and AIBN as initiator. Original biomacromolecules were successfully prepared by post-polymerization modification.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein-polymer bioconjugates have shown great promise in biomedical and life science applications including drug delivery and diagnosis. The current bioconjugation strategies suffer from lack of efficiency and versatility. In this article, poly(styrene-&lt;i&gt;alt&lt;/i&gt;-maleic anhydride) copolymers were first prepared by RAFT polymerization and characterized by different analytical techniques. Then, the poly(styrene-&lt;i&gt;alt&lt;/i&gt;-maleic anhydride) precursors were functionalized with primary amine such as azidopropylamine and amino poly(ethylene glycol). The reaction of amino compounds with maleic anhydride was found to be a highly efficient, a versatile, and a facile chemical ligation reaction for the synthesis of macromolecules with quantitative yield under mild conditions. The main benefit is the incorporation of a wide range of functionality by easily changing the primary amine compound. For the amphiphilic graft copolymers based on poly(ethylene glycol), aggregation behavior in water was investigated. In a second part, azido-functionalized polystyrene copolymers were used to prepare a new protein-polymer bioconjugate by copper-free click chemistry reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Flexible Synthesis and Herbicidal Activity of Fully Substituted 3&#8208;Hydroxypyrazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and herbicidal efficacy of a novel library of fully substituted 3&#8208;hydroxypyrazoles is reported. A final step diversification approach was employed to efficiently introduce various substituents in the 1&#8208; and 4&#8208;positions of the pyrazole. A scalable, multi&#8208;gram synthesis of the lead compound is also described.







Abstract
The synthesis and herbicidal efficacy of a novel library of fully substituted 3&#8208;hydroxypyrazoles is reported. An efficient, divergent approach to introduce phenyl, phenoxy, phenylsulfanyl, anilino and benzyl substituents in the 4&#8208;position of the pyrazole, alongside a flexible synthesis of N1&#8208;alkyl analogues is described via final step diversification of key intermediates. Herbicidal screening of the prepared compounds against key weed species identified the lead compound 2&#8208;[4&#8208;(2,4&#8208;difluorophenoxy)&#8208;1,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl]oxy&#8208;5&#8208;fluoropyrimidine, which was prepared on a multi&#8208;gram scale using an optimised synthetic route.

         <title>Preparation of Lactams from Cyclic Anhydrides via N&#8208;Carboxyanhydride Intermediates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic anhydrides can be readily converted to ring&#8208;contracted lactams after sequential silylazidation, protonolysis, Curtius rearrangement and catalysis of ring closure by DMAP, in an operationally simple procedure. Succinic anhydrides do not form ring&#8208;contracted &#946;&#8208;lactams but instead generate &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides which serve as activated analogues of &#946;&#8208;amino acids of use in &#946;&#8208;peptide and polymer chemistry.







Abstract
The ring contraction&#8208;lactamisation of anhydrides upon reaction with trimethylsilylazide in the presence of an amine catalyst has been studied. Under controlled conditions, 5,&#8208; 6&#8208; and 8&#8208;membered ring lactams can be generated from cyclic anhydrides in an operationally simple procedure. In the case of &#947;&#8208;lactams, the methodology allows for the synthesis of challenging systems incompatible with the usual disconnection involving an amine and an activated carbonyl group. The synthesis of simple larger ring lactams is hampered by inaccessible monomeric cyclic anhydride precursors &#8208; a problem which can be circumvented through rigidification. Succinic anhydrides make N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides of use in polymer chemistry and as &#946;&#8208;peptide precursors.

         <dc:description>
An unprecedented efficient method for the reductive amination of carbonyl derivatives with &#969;&#8208;amino fatty acids under hydrosilylation conditions was developed leading to the corresponding lactams. A variety of pyrrolidinones, piperidinones, 2&#8208;azepanones were prepared in up to 95&#8201;% isolated yields (29 examples).







Abstract
An efficient method for the preparation of lactams from &#969;&#8208;amino fatty acids under hydrosilylation is described. A variety of lactams such as pyrrolidinones, piperidinones and 2&#8208;azepanones were selectively synthesised in moderate to excellent yields (29 examples, up to 95&#8201;% isolated yields) with a good functional group tolerance. Notably, no metallic based catalyst was required to perform this transformation.

         <title>Synthesis and Functionalization of C6/C7 Substituted Pyrido[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted pyrido[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidines are accessible by a reaction sequence consisting of HWE&#8208;reaction, a Z/E&#8208;photoisomerization, and ring closure of the pyridine ring. Bis&#8208;pyridopyrimidines can be obtained from 7&#8208;amino&#8208;pyrido[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidines.







Abstract
An efficient synthesis of functionalized pyrido[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidines is reported. Starting from 4&#8208;aminopyrimidine&#8208;3&#8208;carbaldehydes, a Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons olefination followed by a photoisomerization/cyclization installed the fused pyridine ring. Using substituted HWE&#8208;reagents various substituents could be introduced in the 7&#8208;position of the pyrido[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidines. Functionalization of the pyridone substructure allowed late variation in the 6&#8208;position. In order to obtain amine&#8208;linked bis&#8208;pyridopyrimidines, 7&#8208;bromo&#8208;pyridopyrimidines were converted with their 7&#8208;amino&#8208;counterpart by Hartwig&#8211;Buchwald amination.

A three&#8208;step synthesis leading to the trans&#8208;stilbene molecular scaffold was successfully designed and performed. In order to carry out this synthetic pathway, a highly selective and high yielding oxidative Heck cross&#8208;coupling method was developed and optimized. A trans&#8208;stilbene derivative [(E)&#8208;5&#8208;(2&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid]] required in a medicinal chemistry project was successfully up&#8208;scaled (&gt;1000&#215;) and exploited for the production of the substance on a multi&#8208;gram (150&#8197;g) scale.







Abstract
A selective oxidative Heck cross&#8208;coupling method was developed and optimized as a pivotal step for a synthetic route leading to the trans&#8208;stilbene framework. The developed method and synthesis were needed in a SAR study in progress that concerned design and development of an inhibitor for the human cell xCT antiporter system. The developed oxidative Heck cross&#8208;coupling method was examined with a variety of substrates and reagents to produce a library of different substituted trans&#8208;stilbenes, which revealed the method to hold a very good tolerance for an assortment of functional groups. The final synthetic route was successfully scaled&#8208;up (from mg scale) and performed in a 150&#8197;g (&gt;1000&#215;up&#8208;scaled) batch run to obtain an overall yield of 73&#8201;% (over three steps), which corresponds to a mean step yield of 90&#8201;%. The inhibitor candidate DC10 [(E)&#8208;5&#8208;(2&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;benzoic acid] was produced in multi&#8208;gram quantities (&#8776;33&#8197;g) that subsequently was forwarded for animal efficacy and toxicology studies. The scaled&#8208;up process constitutes the first example of an oxidative Heck cross&#8208;coupling on &gt;100&#8208;gram scale.

         <dc:description>
Achieving control over the diastereoselectivity of 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions to obtain maximum number of diastereomers under simple operation is an enduring challenge. In this work, the diastereodivergent 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated arylketones and azomethine ylides was studied experimentally and theoretically. The reaction produced pyrrolidines (endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;adducts under Ag(I) and Cu(II) catalysis respectively) with four contiguous stereogenic centers bearing a fluorinated quaternary stereogenic center at C4.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Dipolar cycloaddition of &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated arylketones and azomethine ylides has been experimentally and theoretically investigated. The reaction proceeded in a diastereodivergent fashion: in contrast to our previous results where exo&#8208;adducts were obtained under Cu(II) catalysis, herein we have achieved the endo&#8208;selective 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition using Ag(I) catalyst. Theoretical DFT calculations have been performed to understand the origin of diastereoselectivity switch, possible mechanism, and geometrical features of organometallic intermediates of both catalytic processes. The free&#8208;energy profiles suggested that the Michael addition step is the rate determining step, and the coordination between silver atom and carbonyl oxygen atom of enone is the driving force behind endo&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Supported Synthesis of Adenosine Nucleotides and Derivatives on a Benzene&#8208;Centered Tripodal Soluble Support</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy based on anchoring C(6) azidopurine nucleoside derivative to a tripodal soluble support allows to access the corresponding adenosine nucleotides. We extended the scope of the method to methylene bisphosphonate analogues and N6&#8208;benzylamine derivative.







Abstract
The first soluble&#8208;phase synthesis of adenosine nucleotides including &#945;,&#946; and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;methylene bisphosphonate analogues on a multi&#8208;pod support is reported. Anchoring of a 2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;protected purine nucleoside to the tripodal support via the nucleobase was successfully achieved using a microwave assisted Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition. Then, phosphorylation was performed, followed by cleavage with aqueous ammonia to provide adenine derivatives, and finally deprotection. When using benzylamine instead of ammonia, a derivative with N6&#8208;benzylamine adenine as nucleobase was obtained. This methodology allows to access adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;mono, di and triphosphates, as well as various analogues of pharmacological interest in modest to good yields.

         <title>Heteroaliphatic Dimethylphosphine Oxide Building Blocks: Synthesis and Physico&#8208;Chemical Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multigram synthesis of saturated heterocyclic dimethylphosphine oxides (derivatives of azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, and morpholine) &#8211; advanced building blocks for medicinal chemistry &#8211; as well as their physico&#8208;chemical properties (pKa, logP, and Sw) are disclosed.







Abstract
Scalable synthesis of saturated heterocyclic dimethyl phosphine oxides (derivatives of azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, and morpholine) is disclosed. The key steps of the synthesis relied on the reactions of HP(O)Me2, i.&#8201;e. the phospha&#8208;Mannich (the Kabachnik&#8208;Fields&#8208;type) condensation with cyclic imines or monoprotected diamines, palladium&#8208;catalyzed reactions of alkenyl halides or trifltates (generated from cyclic ketones), as well as base&#8208;mediated nucleophilic substitution, Michael addition, or oxirane ring opening. It was shown that introducing the P(O)Me2 group into the saturated heterocyclic core had very strong impact on the compound's basicity: the corresponding &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;isomeric derivatives were by ca. 4, 2, and 1.6&#8197;pKa units less basic, respectively, as compared to the parent saturated heterocycle. Meanwhile, the P(O)Me2&#8208;substituted compound was more basic than its SO2i&#8208;Pr and SO2NMe2&#8208;containing isosteres (by ca. 1.2 and 0.4&#8197;pKa units, respectively). It was also demonstrated that the P(O)Me2 group typically increased the compound's hydrophilicity and aqueous solubility. In particular, the LogP values for the corresponding derivatives were by ca. 1.4&#8211;1.7 and 0.6&#8197;units lower than for the non&#8208;substituted counterpart and sulfonamide/sulfone isosteres, respectively. Finally, a potential of the synthesized building blocks to generate lead&#8208;like three&#8208;dimensional compound libraries was confirmed using the Nelson's LLAMA tool.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scalable synthesis of saturated heterocyclic dimethyl phosphine oxides (derivatives of azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, and morpholine) is disclosed. The key steps of the synthesis relied on the reactions of HP(O)Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, i.&#8201;e. the &lt;i&gt;phospha&lt;/i&gt;-Mannich (the Kabachnik-Fields-type) condensation with cyclic imines or monoprotected diamines, palladium-catalyzed reactions of alkenyl halides or trifltates (generated from cyclic ketones), as well as base-mediated nucleophilic substitution, Michael addition, or oxirane ring opening. It was shown that introducing the P(O)Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group into the saturated heterocyclic core had very strong impact on the compound's basicity: the corresponding &#945;-, &#946;-, and &#947;-isomeric derivatives were by ca. 4, 2, and 1.6&#8197;p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; units less basic, respectively, as compared to the parent saturated heterocycle. Meanwhile, the P(O)Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-substituted compound was more basic than its SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;i-&lt;/i&gt;Pr and SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-containing isosteres (by ca. 1.2 and 0.4&#8197;p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; units, respectively). It was also demonstrated that the P(O)Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group typically increased the compound's hydrophilicity and aqueous solubility. In particular, the Log&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values for the corresponding derivatives were by &lt;i&gt;ca&lt;/i&gt;. 1.4&#8211;1.7 and 0.6&#8197;units lower than for the non-substituted counterpart and sulfonamide/sulfone isosteres, respectively.

A robust gram&#8208;scale synthesis, physico&#8208;chemical characterization, and lead&#8208;likeness assessment of novel 4&#8208;di/trifluoromethyl&#8208;2&#8208;heterabicyclo[2.1.1]hexane building blocks as fluorinated 2,4&#8208;methanoproline analogues and phenyl isosteres are disclosed.







Abstract
A gram&#8208;scale synthesis, physico&#8208;chemical characterization, and lead&#8208;likeness assessment of 4&#8208;di/trifluoromethyl&#8208;2&#8208;heterabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes as fluorinated bicyclic proline analogues and phenyl isosteres are disclosed. The key step of the synthesis included iodocyclization of fluorinated 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;/3&#8208;aminomethyl methylenecyclobutanes; with the amino derivatives, the reaction was accompanied with carboxylation and further cyclization. Apart from the corresponding 4&#8208;di/trifluoromethyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;methanoprolines, a series of fluorinated oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexane&#8208;derived building blocks relevant to medicinal chemistry (i.&#8201;e. primary iodides, carboxylic acids, alcohols, azides, primary amines, sulfonyl chlorides, and alkynes) were prepared. For representative derivatives of the resulting fluorinated 2&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes, pKa and logP values were measured to clarify their potential as the possible phenyl isosteres. Apart from the somewhat increased acidity, fine&#8208;tuned lipophilicity intermediate between that of non&#8208;fluorinated or aromatic counterparts was observed. Finally, the potential of the title building blocks was demonstrated by generation of virtual compound libraries using the LLAMA software. The resulting libraries fitted perfectly the lead&#8208;like chemical space, had higher three&#8208;dimensionality, and showed lower mean lead&#8208;likeness penalty as compared to those obtained from either non&#8208;fluorinated or aromatic derivatives.

         <title>Functionalized 5&#8208;Amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles, their Hetero&#8208; and Macrocyclic Derivatives: Preparation and Synthetic Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach for the synthesis of new 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles with carboxylate group at the C&#8208;2 position, connected to the heterocycle directly or through an aliphatic linker, was developed. This process features readily available starting materials, simple operations, and good to high yields. Wide synthetic applicability of the obtained compounds was also successfully demonstrated by further modifications.







Abstract
An approach to a series of new 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles is described. Synthesis of the title compounds relied on a two&#8208;step sequence including heterocyclization of 2&#8208;amido&#8208;3,3&#8208;dichloroacrylonitriles with aliphatic secondary amines (dimethylamine, morpholine), primary aliphatic amines with active functional groups (2&#8208;aminoethanol and glycine ethyl ester), and aniline. An efficient and straightforward protocol introduces a carboxylate group at the C&#8208;2 position of 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles, connected to the heterocycle directly or through an aliphatic linker. This carboxylic group is an attractive motif that can be found in a variety of drug&#8208;relevant compounds and also used for further modifications. Furthermore, efficient transformations of selected trisubstituted compounds were used to demonstrate their rich synthetic potential &#8211; e.&#8201;g., as precursors to 2&#8208;(4&#8208;cyano&#8208;5&#8208;(dimethylamino)oxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetamides, oxazole&#8208;containing macrocyclic structures, 2&#8208;(oxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetamides, amino pyrazoles, 3&#8208;(4&#8208;cyano&#8208;5&#8208;aminoxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)coumarins, and oxazole amino acids.

         <title>Monoprotected Diamines Derived from 1,5&#8208;Disubstituted (Aza)spiro[2.3]hexane Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted (aza)spiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. Structural characterization of the obtained spirocyclic compounds provided a rationale for their applications in design of saturated ring isosteres and peptidomimetics.







Abstract
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted spiro[2.3]hexane and 5&#8208;azaspiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. In both cases, the method relied on the cyclopropanation of the corresponding cyclobutane or azetidine derivatives. In the case of monoprotected 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexanes, the title products were obtained as single diastereomers. X&#8208;Ray diffraction studies supported by exit vector plot (EVP) analysis showed that the obtained building blocks are promising piperidine/cycloalkane isosteres with potential utility to drug discovery. Also, conformations observed in the crystalline state for the two different diastereomers of 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexane derivatives prompt their application in design of &#946;&#8208;turn and sheet&#8208;like peptidomimetics, respectively.

         <title>Last of the gem&#8208;Difluorocycloalkanes 2: Synthesis of Fluorinated Cycloheptane Building Blocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isomeric gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane derivatives were obtained in two to six synthetic steps from readily available starting materials. The developed synthetic approaches were shown to be efficient for a multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of target compounds and involved six&#8208;membered ring homologation and/or deoxofluorination reactions as the key steps.







Abstract
The gem&#8208;difluorocycloalkane family was extended to all possible regioisomers of the gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane, monofunctionalized by carboxilic&#8208;, amino&#8208; or keto&#8208; group, that were synthesized on a multigram scale. The preparation of the corresponding building blocks was achieved from readily accessible starting materials either via six&#8208;membered ring homologation or deoxofluorination of the appropriate seven&#8208;membered cyclic ketones.

         <title>Reaction of N,N&#8208;Disubstituted Polyfluoroalkanethioamides with Diazomethane: Entry to New Thiirane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4&#8208;dioxane derivatives are discussed.






New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between N,N&#8208;disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

         <title>Multigram Synthesis of Heterabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl Trifluoroborates</title>

         <dc:description>
  Multigram synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates relying on efficient 4&#8211;5&#8208;step reaction sequences is described. The title compounds was obtained in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield).
  
  
  
  
 
 
  An approach to the synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates on a multigram scale was developed. Two synthetic strategies were evaluated: the first based on the lithiation&#8211;borylation of the corresponding 2&#8208;bromoallyl derivatives, and the other relying on regioselective hydroboration of the appropriate hetera&#8208;substituted enynes. The second method appeared to be more efficient in terms of scalability and substrate scope. Further steps included ring closing&#8208;metathesis, mild palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation with diazomethane, and reaction with KHF2 and furnished the title compounds in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield, 4&#8211;5 steps).

         <dc:description>
  A multigram synthesis of spirocyclic &#947;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;sultams is reported, which are advanced building blocks for organic synthesis and drug discovery. The synthesis proceeds through a one&#8208;pot reductive cyclization of cyclic cyano sulfonyl fluorides.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  One&#8208;pot intramolecular cyclization of novel sp3&#8208;enriched cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluorides into spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;sultams is disclosed. The method relies on nitrile group reduction followed by sulfonylation of amino group thus formed upon mild conditions (NaBH4, NiCl2&#183;6H2O in MeOH). Cyclization proceeds smoothly with considerable efficiency (48&#8211;84&#8201;%, 10 examples) on up to 30 g scale. The cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluoride intermediates can be obtained via S&#8208;nucleophilic substitution in &#946;&#8208;functionalized alkanenitriles or double alkylation of &#945;&#8208;alkylthioacetonitrile, followed by oxidative chlorination with Cl2 and further reaction with KHF2. The title mono&#8208; and bifunctional sultams are advanced sp3&#8208;enriched building blocks for drug discovery and organic synthesis providing novel substitution patterns and frameworks mimicking saturated nitrogen heterocycles such as pyrrolidine/pyrrolidone.
