         <title>Stereo&#8208; and Chemoselective Enrichment of sp3 Character in Post&#8208;Ugi Morpholines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We conducted a systematic study on synthesis and modification of morpholine core using Ugi adducts derived from propiolic acid and glycolaldehyde dimer. The assembly step involved triphenylphosphine&#8208;promoted 6&#8208;exo&#8208;dig umpolung oxa&#8208;Michael cyclization of Ugi&#8208;derived hydroxypropargylamides yielding 2&#8208;methylenemorpholin&#8208;3&#8208;one derivatives. Subsequent heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of the exocyclic double bond proceeded in a highly diastereoselective fashion establishing a relative cis configuration in the resulting sp3&#8208;enriched morpholinone scaffold. Finally, chemoselective amide reduction with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) allowed to obtain fully saturated morpholines while leaving the more sterically hindered exocyclic amide moiety intact. Taken together these findings outline the strategy for controlled reduction of the inherent rigidity of post&#8208;Ugi scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>(3+3)&#8208;Annulation of 2&#8208;Mercaptobenzimidazoles With &#945;&#8208;(Trifluoromethyl)Styrene Under Ultrasonic Irradiation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This protocol developed (3+3)&#8208;annulation of 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazoles with &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)styrene under ultrasonic irradiation. The cyclized product was formed through the Michael addition and intramolecular substitution reaction successively. The pure products were obtained with simple recrystallization.







Abstract
A rapid and facile sonochemical route for the [3+3] annulation of 2&#8208;mercapto benzimidazoles with &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)styrene was reported for the synthesis of fluorinated benzo[4,5]imidazo[2,1&#8208;b][1,3]thiazines. The reaction proceeds through the SN2/SNV pathway while the selective SN2 pathway is completely inhibited. The developed method is effective with a wide range of substrates, tolerating diverse functional groups. The pure products are obtained with high yield (up to 92&#8201;%) directly via recrystallization without column chromatography. Furthermore, applying sonochemical methodology reduces the reaction time and eliminates the need for expensive photocatalysts, ligands or oxidants.

         <title>Synthesis, Structures, and Physical Properties of ExTTF Substituted with Aryl Groups through Sulfur Bridges and the Electron Transfers with C60</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four molecular tweezers with good electron donor ability were synthesized and fully characterized. The UV&#8208;Vis absorption studies showed that intermolecular electron transfer existed between compounds 1&#8211;4 and C60.







Abstract
ExTTF derivatives (1&#8211;4) bearing aryl groups attached through sulfur bridges have been synthesized. The peripheral aryl groups have a certain influence on both the electronic and crystallographic properties of the exTTFs. Compounds 1&#8211;4 show two bands typical of exTTF derivatives near 360 and 430&#8197;nm. Compound 1 and 4 exhibit the characteristic electrochemical exTTF behavior, with one reversible two&#8208;electron process ranging depending on their substitution the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability. But 2 and 3 exhibit a similar single two&#8208;electron oxidation wave but electrochemically irreversible redox with peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak potential separation. And 3 has a low redox potential, which is significantly inconsistent with the electron absorption of pyridine substituents. The crystal structures of 1&#8211;4 exhibit the characteristic butterfly shape. Moreover, the peripheral aryl groups exhibit multiple alignment modes with respect to the central exTTF core, caused by their rotation about the two C&#8722;S bonds of the sulfur bridges. Under the interaction of multiple molecules, exTTF shows different molecular packing structures. Compounds 1&#8211;4 have charge transfer with C60 due to their good electron&#8208;donating ability, butterfly configuration, and free rotation of peripheral aryl groups. These results indicate that 1&#8211;4 organic electronic materials have potential applications in the field of supramolecular assembly.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent times, photo&#8208;redox catalysis has emerged as a valuable tool in organic transformations owing to its environmentally friendly nature and utilization of abundant resources. This paper provides an overview of organic transformations achieved through metal and non&#8208;metallic photocatalysts or even without the necessity of photocatalysts from 2019 to 2024.







Abstract
The adoption of clean and renewable light sources is becoming increasingly prevalent in organic synthesis due to their welfare, workability and economic benefits. In recent times, photo&#8208;redox catalysis has emerged as a valuable tool in organic transformations owing to its environmentally friendly nature and utilization of abundant resources. Since harmful or polluting reagents are not needed for the organic photochemical reactions, these reactions provide insights into sustainable processes and green chemistry. N&#8208;Heterocyclic compounds (NHC's) constitute fundamental structural motifs in numerous organic compounds and are widely encountered in natural products and pharmaceuticals with diverse biological activities. Consequently, investigations into the synthesis and modification of these NHC's such as indole, carbazole, benzimidazole, quinoline, isoquinoline and pyridine hold particular significance for chemists and pharmacologists. This review provides an overview of the impact of photocatalysis on synthesis of NHC's and their modification from 2019 to 2024. These transformations are achieved through the utilization of both metal photocatalysts (e.&#8201;g., Ir, Pd, Co, Gd etc.) and non&#8208;metallic photocatalysts (e.&#8201;g., Eosin&#8208;Y, 4CzIPN, Mes&#8208;Acr+ClO4&#8722; etc.), or even without the necessity of photocatalysts. It is anticipated that this review will serve as a valuable resource for researchers delving into the promising realm of photocatalyzed transformations.

         <title>Amination of Alkylboronic Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkylboronic esters are high value chemical building blocks which can be used to make complex, C&#8208;sp3 rich molecules. The ability to convert the C&#8208;B bond in a range of C&#8208;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions, in addition to their broad functional group compatibility, gives alkylboronic esters significant synthetic utility. Methods to convert boronic esters into amines have particular interest, due to the wide prevalence of nitrogen&#8208;based functional groups in biologically active compounds, functional materials, and catalysts. In this review, we explore different methods for the amination of alkylboronic esters. These can be split into three distinct classes based on the mechanism of reaction: amination through 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangement, amination using nucleophilic &#8216;ate&#8217; complexes, and oxidative amination reactions such as alkyl variants of the Chan&#8208;Lam reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Photooxidation of Polystyrene into High&#8208;Value Chemicals</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an overview of recent studies in the photooxidative degradation of polystyrene into benzoyl compounds. It includes a comparative analysis of various degradation methods, highlighting their effectiveness and efficiency. Additionally, the review discusses the underlying mechanisms involved in the degradation process and addresses the challenges that remain in this field.







Abstract
Plastics play a crucial role in the survival and advancement of human civilization. However, the increasing challenge of plastic pollution presents significant obstacles. Disposal methods such as incineration and landfilling result in substantial resource wastage and pose potential environmental hazards. The slow progress in recycling and reusing waste plastics hinders their industrial application and effective response to environmental crises. Photocatalysis offers promising solutions for the future of plastic recycling, particularly with the recent increase in photocatalytic degradation methods for polystyrene (PS). This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in the photooxidation of PS into high&#8208;value chemicals.

         <dc:description>
A convenient method for the N&#8208;modification of NH&#8208;tetrazoles by the Rh(II)&#8208;catalyzed insertion reaction of diazocarbonyl compounds into the N&#8208;H bond has been proposed. A wide scope of structurally diverse diazo reagents as well as tetrazoles with different substituents in the fifth position have been used to prepare disubstituted tetrazole derivatives in good and high yields and with high regioselectivity.

A convenient method for the N&#8208;modification of NH&#8208;tetrazoles by the Rh(II)&#8208;catalyzed insertion reaction of diazocarbonyl compounds into the N&#8722;H bond has been proposed. A wide range of structurally diverse diazo reagents (including heterocyclic ones) as well as tetrazoles with different substituents in the fifth position have been used to prepare 2,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole derivatives in good and high yields and with high regioselectivity. It is shown that the regioselectivity of the reaction can decrease in the presence of electron withdrawing groups in the tetrazole, as well as in the presence of protic acids.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green, one&#8208;pot and metal&#8208;free synthetic approach to indeno[2,1&#8208;b]quinolin&#8208;6&#8208;ones and indolo[1,2&#8208;b]isoquinoline&#8208;6,12&#8208;diones is presented starting with indan&#8208;1&#8208;ones and 2&#8208;nitrobenzaldehydes. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies reveal that the reactions are initiated by attack of a conjugate base of indan&#8208;1&#8208;ones to the aldehyde or to the adjacent nitro group of 2&#8208;nitrobenzaldehydes followed by intramolecular cyclization involving a second anion to furnish the appropriate products.







Abstract
Highly efficient one&#8208;pot synthesis of a series of indeno[2,1&#8208;b]quinolin&#8208;6&#8208;ones 10 and indolo[1,2&#8208;b]isoquinoline&#8208;6,12&#8208;diones 12 is portrayed from easily accessible starting materials such as indan&#8208;1&#8208;ones 7 and 2&#8208;nitrobenzaldehydes 9. The reaction mechanism studies by control experiments and computational analysis reveal that the reactions are initiated by attack of a conjugate base of indanones 7 to the aldehyde group or the adjacent nitro group of 2&#8208;nitrobenzaldehydes 9 followed by intramolecular cyclization involving a second anion to furnish the appropriate products. The heterocyclic compounds were obtained in moderate to good yields.

         <dc:description>
A facile approach unfolding one&#8208;pot cyclization of chromone and coumarin amines bestowing valuable fused amino/imino thiazoles via thiocyanation using potassium thiocyanate under ambient conditions. This methodology emphasizes enaminone cyclization towards the fused heterocyclic frameworks.







Abstract
A rapid metal&#8208;free approach describing one&#8208;pot thiocyanation of chromone and coumarin enabling tandem cyclization via potassium thiocyanate as a sulfur surrogate was unveiled. Interestingly, this enaminone&#8208;mediated protocol facilitated straightforward access to medicinally significant 2&#8208;amino/imino thiazolo fused chromone and coumarin frameworks. This methodology provided good atom&#8208;economy, remarkable functional group tolerance, and scalability. Alongside establishing a wide substrate scope, it also provided a feasible scalability up to gram scale.

         <title>Photoactivated Formal [3 + 2]/[4+2] Cycloaddition of N&#8208;Aryl Cyclopropyl and Cyclobutylamines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 44, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Presented here is a visible light&#8208;mediated formal cycloaddition reaction of cyclopropylamines with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl systems. Driven by strained ring systems, this reaction facilitates the synthesis of diverse cycloaminoalkyl scaffolds. The study unveils two distinct mechanistic pathways: the [3+2] cycloaddition, guided by the photochemical activity of an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex and the [4+2] annulation of cyclobutylanilines facilitated by photoredox catalysis.







Abstract
Organic transformations initiated by photochemical activation have been at the forefront of reaction discovery. In this study, we present a formal photochemical [3+2] and [4+2] cycloaddition using N&#8208;aryl cyclopropylamines and N&#8208;aryl cyclobutylamines in conjunction with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl systems, unveiling two distinct mechanistic pathways. The [3+2] cycloaddition is elucidated as being guided by the photochemical activity of an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex. Simultaneously, intermolecular [4+2] annulation of cyclobutylanilines is achieved by visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis. These simple methodologies have wide applicability, facilitating the synthesis of N&#8208;arylaminocycloalkyl compounds in yields ranging from good to excellent.

         <dc:description>
We have described the diastereoselective construction of new aryl azide&#8208; and triazole&#8208;based unnatural amino acid derivatives via the Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation method. Synthesis of various racemic and enantioenriched aryl azide&#8208;based unnatural amino acid motifs including, norvaline, leucine, norleucine, phenylalanine, 2&#8208;aminobutyric acid, 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid and non&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives was reported. Aryl azide and triazole moiety containing unnatural amino acid derivatives are notable substrates in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry. Accordingly, this work contributes to enriching the library of aryl azide&#8208; and triazole&#8208;based unnatural amino acid derivatives.







Abstract
This paper reports a method for the synthesis of examples of aryl azide&#8208; and triazole moiety&#8208;based unnatural amino acid motifs using the Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed arylation of the prochiral C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of carboxamides of amino acids as one of the key transformations. Synthesis of racemic and enantioenriched aryl azide&#8208;based unnatural amino acid motifs including, norvaline, leucine, norleucine, phenylalanine, 2&#8208;aminobutyric acid, 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid, and non&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives were shown. Additionally, we attempted the synthesis of triazole moiety&#8208;installed norvaline, leucine, norleucine, phenylalanine, 2&#8208;aminobutyric acid, 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid, and non&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives via the Cu&#8208;catalyzed Click reaction. We also demonstrated the removal of the protecting groups and the synthesis of free amino group&#8208;containing aryl azide&#8208; or triazole&#8208;based unnatural amino acid motifs and peptides. Generally, azide moiety&#8208;containing unnatural amino acid motifs are important molecular tools in chemical biology. Furthermore, aryl azide&#8208; and triazole moiety&#8208;containing unnatural amino acid scaffolds are notable substrates in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery research. Accordingly, this work contributes to enriching the library of aryl azide&#8208; and triazole&#8208;based unnatural amino acid derivatives.

         <title>The Pyramidalization of sp2 Centers in 3/2&#8208;Systems Is a &#8220;Structural Breathing&#8221; Independent of Energy</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 44, November 25, 2024. </description>

In 3/2&#8208;systems, such as the acetate anion H3C&#945;C&#8242;OO&#8722;, an sp3 center and an sp2 center are connected by a covalent bond. The interaction of threefold and twofold symmetry results in the pyramidalization of the sp2 center during rotation about bond C&#945;&#8722;C&#8242; for rotation angles&#8800;0&#176;, &#177;60&#176;, &#177;120&#176;, and &#177;180&#176;, enforcing a pyramidalization/rotation profile with three maxima, three minima, and six zero&#8208;crossings as indicated by the triangles in the diagram.







Abstract
In 3/2&#8208;systems, such as the acetate anion H3C&#945;C&#8242;OO&#8722;, an sp3 center and an sp2 center are connected by a covalent bond. The interaction of threefold and twofold symmetry results in the pyramidalization of the sp2 center during rotation about bond Esp3&#8722;Esp2. Rotation angles &#968;=0&#176;, &#177;60&#176;, &#177;120&#176;, and &#177;180&#176; account for conformations with a symmetry plane containing the planar sp2 center C&#945;C&#8242;OO. However, in all conformations with rotation angles &#968;&#8800;0&#176;, &#177;60&#176;, &#177;120&#176;, and &#177;180&#176; this symmetry plane is lost and pyramidalization must occur with maxima at rotation angles &#968;=&#177;30&#176;, &#177;90&#176;, and &#177;150&#176;, because the two sides of the sp2 center C&#945;C&#8242;OO are different. Inevitably, this leads to a pyramidalization/rotation profile &#952;/&#968; with three maxima, three minima, and six zero&#8208;crossings. Thus, myriads of 3/2&#8208;compounds pyramidalize their sp2 centers each moment to the order of about 2&#176; in a coupled pyramidalization/rotation molecular motion independent of energy.

         <dc:description>
Oxidative cyclization of o&#8208;substituted aniline derivatives with primary amines for the synthesis of benzimidazoles, benzothiazoles, and quinoxalines with oxygen as the terminal oxidant, the method used the commercially available organocatalyst PTCDI as a heterogeneous catalyst and can be recycled six times without significant loss of catalytic activity.







Abstract
The commercially available 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI) acted as a heterogeneous catalyst to catalyze aerobic oxidative synthesis of benzimidazoles, benzothiazoles, and quinoxalines from o&#8208;substituted aniline derivatives and primary amines in high yields with oxygen as the terminal oxidant. The gram scale reaction and reusability (up to six cycles) of the PTCDI catalyst were also successful and would greatly benefit industrial applications.

         <dc:description>
An organophotocatalytic perfluoroalkylation and alkylthiolation of acrylamides is demonstrated. This role of pendant functionality in achieving molecular diversity was established. This reaction manifold provides access to diverse fluorinated and thiolated molecular architectures.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated, organophotocatalyzed cascade perfluoroalkylation and alkylthiolation of o&#8208;cyano and o&#8208;alkynyl acrylamides is reported. The reaction exhibits wide scope and provides polyfluorinated 1,3&#8208;quinoline diones and trifluoromethylated fused tricyclic quinolinones under mild reaction conditions and in good yields. Access to a variety of molecular architectures and the synthetic application of aliphatic thiols are the highlights of this reactivity manifold.

         <title>Varying the Electronics on Isothiourea Catalysts: Basicity, Rate, and Selectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 44, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted benzoisothiourea catalysts were studied to understand how changing catalyst electronics affects rate and selectivity in a model reaction. This information ultimately indicates how intermolecular interactions are affected between catalyst and substrates.







Abstract
Chiral and achiral substituted isothiourea catalysts were synthesized and employed in model silylation reactions to understand how changing the electronics on the catalyst core affected intermolecular interactions between catalyst intermediates and substrates, ultimately affecting selectivity and rate. Five different chiral catalysts were utilized in a silylation&#8208;based kinetic resolution of 2&#8208;(para substituted)phenylcyclohexanols and the rate of silylation of these same alcohols was investigated with three different achiral catalysts. Linear free energy relationships were examined, highlighting that rate and selectivity were highly dependent on the electronics of the catalyst and the substrate, and that both affected the intermolecular interactions that resulted.

One&#8208;pot synthesis has been developed for bridged bicyclic benzoxepines from benzoxepines and aminocrotonates. Compounds were formed through [3+3]&#8208;annulation with new C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds.







Abstract
A new and effective method for making bridged bicyclic benzoxepine derivatives were devised through the intermolecular [3+3]&#8208;annulation of benzoxepine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates with aminocrotonates in the presence of La(OTf)3. The compounds were formed through reactions involving the benzoxepine moiety's C&#8208;3 and C&#8208;5 carbons to produce C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds. One of the compound structure (&#177;) 12&#8208;ethyl&#8208;6&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,3,4,7&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;3,7&#8208;methano benzo[h][1,4]&#8208;oxazonine&#8208;6,12&#8208;dicarboxylate was confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Induced and PIFA Enabled [4+2] Annulation of Alkenes with N&#8208;Aryl Substituted Hydroxamic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 44, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a visible&#8208;light irradiation and PIFA oxidized [4+2] annulation of alkenes with N&#8208;aryl substituted hydroxamic acids as the amidoxyl radical precursors was report. The reaction provides a new approach toward ben&#8208;zo[c][1,2]oxazines. A series of alkenes and N&#8208;aryl substituted hydroxamic acids worked well under the reaction conditions, affording the desired products in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
In this paper, we reported a facile approach for the preparation of benzo[c][1,2]oxazine scaffolds via visible light induced phenyl iodine bis(trifluoroacetate) (PIFA) oxidative [4+2] annulation of vinyl benzenes with N&#8208;aryl substituted hydroxamic acids. In the transformation, amidoxyl radicals are readily generated via covalent I&#8722;O bond formation and photo&#8208;induced I&#8722;O cleavage from N&#8208;aryl substituted hydroxamic acids, and their coupling with vinyl arenes in the form of [4+2] annulation delivers benzo[c]&#8208;[1,2]oxazines derivatives. This reaction proceeds in the absence of transition metals and catalysts, exhibiting broad substrate scope of both alkenes and N&#8208;aryl substituted hydroxamic acids.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of 2&#8208;Arylpropionitriles Via Selective Monomethylation of Aryl Acetonitriles Using an Easy to Handle Methylation Agent</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 44, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Only one! Using a safe, easy to handle, and solid methylating agent, selective monomethylation of aryl acetonitriles is achieved. The method shows broad functional group tolerance and can be applied in the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients potentially leading to compounds with increased biological activity due to the renowned magic methyl effect.







Abstract
A convenient and safe methylation protocol employing quaternary ammonium salts (PhMe3NI) as alternative methylating agents for the selective &#945;&#8208;methylation of arylacetonitriles is presented. This approach allows for the selective &#945;&#8208;methylation of arylacetonitriles, overcoming the limitations of existing techniques, while offering a practical and sustainable solution for late&#8208;stage functionalization in medicinal chemistry. The straightforward and safe nature of this methodology makes it particularly well&#8208;suited for applications in drug discovery. In our report, we present a diverse set of 18 examples, achieving yields of up to 76&#8201;%.

         <title>Insights Into the Magnesium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;C Coupling of Terminal Alkynes with Carbodiimides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 44, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of structurally characterized bis&#8208;guanidinate magnesium (II) complexes have been reported. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that magnesium amide (Mg&#8208;1) serves as a precatalyst for carbodiimide hydroalkynylation reaction. The active catalyst, bis&#8208;guanidinate magnesium acetylide (Mg&#8208;2), and the intermediate (Mg&#8208;3) have been isolated and thoroughly characterized. Moreover, a new example of bis&#8208;guanidinate magnesium propiolamidate (Mg&#8208;4) has been reported.







Abstract
The bis&#8208;guanidinate anion stabilized amido magnesium (II) compound [LMgN(SiMe3)2; L={(ArHN)(ArN)&#8722;C=N&#8722;C=(NAr)(NHAr); Ar=2,6&#8208;Et2&#8722;C6H3}] (Mg&#8208;1) has been synthesized and characterized. It has been successfully employed as a pre&#8208;catalyst for the catalytic C&#8722;C coupling of terminal alkynes with carbodiimides, producing propiolamidine products with moderate to good yields. The active catalyst bis&#8208;guanidinate magnesium acetylide [LMgC&#8801;C&#8722;Ph]2 (Mg&#8208;2) and the intermediate magnesium propiolamidinate [LMg{(NiPr)2C}C&#8801;C&#8722;Ph] (Mg&#8208;3) involved in the catalytic reaction were isolated and thoroughly characterized through multinuclear NMR and mass spectral analyses, as well as single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Based on the above findings, a plausible mechanistic cycle has been proposed. Additionally, a new example of bis&#8208;guanidinate supported structurally characterized magnesium propiolamidate compound [LMg{(4&#8722;CH3&#8722;C6H4)N&#8722;(C&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;Ph)=O]2 (Mg&#8208;4) has been described via the reaction between Mg&#8208;2 and isocyanate.

         <dc:description>
A Cu(II)/Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed sequential annulation&#8208;olefination reaction has been developed for the rapid construction of ortho&#8208;olefinated 2&#8208;arylquinoxalines with broad substrate scope, high mono&#8208;substitution selectivity and ortho&#8208;regioselectivity. Application to the derivatization of natural products and pharmaceutical molecules led to compounds with enhanced antiproliferative activities against ovarian cancer and colon cancer cell lines.







Abstract
The quinoxaline scaffold occurs in many pharmaceuticals, natural products and organic materials. In this study, a Cu(II)/Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed regioselective annulation&#8208;olefination sequence for the formation and modification of quinoxalines was developed using ethanol and water as the solvent, with relatively broad substrate scope and functional group tolerance. This protocol has been successfully applied to the derivatization of natural products and pharmaceuticals. Additionally, the derivatives exhibited enhanced antiproliferative activities against A&#8208;2780 and HCT&#8208;116&#8197;cell lines, underscoring their potential as promising lead compounds for ovarian cancer and colon cancer treatment.

         <dc:description>
The chemical synthesis of the repeating units of capsular polysaccharides of pathogenic bacteria is important for the preparation of vaccine candidates against diseases. Herein, the chemical synthesis of the repeating unit of the O&#8208;polysaccharide of the Gram&#8208;negative bacterial strain Proteus mirabilis OC (CCUG 10702) serogroup O75 O&#8208;antigen is reported.







Abstract
Proteus mirabilis is a pathogenic Gram&#8208;negative bacterium that causes several kinds of infections in human beings. Herein, we present the first total synthesis of the O&#8208;antigen tetrasaccharide repeating unit of P. mirabilis OC (CCUG 10702) serogroup O75 with an aminoethyl linker appended at the reducing end. The tetrasaccharide comprising D&#8208;glucosamine, L&#8208;rhamnose, D&#8208;galactose and D&#8208;galactosamine with a key (1&#8594;4)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;glycosidic linkage between D&#8208;galactose and L&#8208;rhamnose was assembled by three stepwise [1+1+1+1], [1+2+1] and [2+2] assembly approaches and one one&#8208;pot [1+2+1] assembly. The respective routes provided the tetrasaccharide in yields of 23&#8201;%, 18&#8201;%, 20&#8201;%, and 26&#8201;% from suitably protected monosaccharide building blocks.

The tetrasaccharide comprising D-glucosamine, L-rhamnose, D-galactose and D-galactosamine with a key (1&#8594;4)-&#945;-glycosidic linkage between D-galactose and L-rhamnose was assembled by three stepwise [1+1+1+1], [1+2+1] and [2+2] assembly approaches and one one-pot [1+2+1] assembly. The respective routes provided the tetrasaccharide in yields of 23&#8201;%, 18&#8201;%, 20&#8201;%, and 26&#8201;% from suitably protected monosaccharide building blocks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Experimentation (HTE) Applied to the Synthesis of API Impurities: A Case Study in Oxidative Decarboxylation of Aryl Acetic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 44, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) was applied to identify new methodologies to achieve oxidative decarboxylation of arylcarboxylic acids in a rapid and cost&#8208;effective manner. The two oxidant systems discovered (RuCl3&#8208;NaIO4 and CAN) were used to obtain a series of popular API impurities, which are essential for impurity profiling during drug development.







Abstract
High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) has dramatically impacted experimental reaction development by enabling the rapid exploration of a diverse set of reaction conditions. During the past few decades, HTE has evolved as a tool to expedite reaction discovery and optimization. This work details the application of HTE to synthesize impurities of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) with ketone/aldehyde functionality, specially focusing on ibuprofen impurity E. Initial experiments using K2S2O8 as oxidant yielded moderate results. Subsequent HTE screens identified cerium ammonium nitrate (CAN) and RuCl3&#8208;NaIO4 as new effective decarboxylative oxidants, with RuCl3&#8208;NaIO4 in the presence of tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) achieving the highest yield of 65&#8201;%. This optimized method was successfully applied to synthesize ibuprofen impurity E on a gram scale. Additionally, the applicability of these methods to obtain other API related substances, such as naproxen impurity L and ketoprofen impurity A, was demonstrated. This research highlights the potential of HTE to streamline the synthesis of API impurities, making them widely accessible for pharmaceutical development purposes.

         <title>Perylene Based Twisted Emissive Curved Nanographene Synthesis through Scholl Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 44, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perylene&#8208;based twisted chiral nanographene (NG) consists of two [6] helices, synthesized by a highly regioselective Scholl cyclodehydrogenation reaction. The NG showed a photoluminescence quantum yield (&#981;f) of 55&#8201;%, indicating its great potential for chiral optoelectronics.







Abstract
A twisted chiral nanographene (NG) surrounded by eight bulky tert&#8208;butyl groups fused with emissive chromophore perylene was synthesized by highly regioselective cyclodehydrogenation strategy in which a double [6]helicene was formed simultaneously. The twisted 4&#8208;meso was unambiguously confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The NG showed an excellent photoluminescence quantum yield (&#981;f) of 55&#8201;%, indicating its great potential for chiral optoelectronics.

         <dc:description>
1,2&#8208;Diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadienes, also called azoalkenes, have received considerable attention as key synthons for constructing various heterocyclic scaffolds. This minireview summarizes the contribution of our group in this field over the period from 2009 to the present, focusing on the role of the azoene building block in forming the heterocyclic structures.







Abstract
The discovery of structurally unique scaffolds entities with increased complexity and balanced physicochemical properties has the potential to allow synthetic chemists to exploit areas of chemical space that were previously inaccessible. Among the different strategies employed for generating N&#8208;heterocycles, cyclization and cycloaddition reactions represent a valuable synthetic tool. The purpose of this minireview is to summarize the recent advances (2009&#8208;present) from our laboratory on the generation of intriguing five&#8208;, six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered mono&#8208; or poly&#8208;heterocyclic architectures (linear, fused and spiro) employing 1,2&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes (DDs) as key synthons.

         <title>Tandem, Catalyst&#8208;Free C&#8722;C Synthesis of Nitriles from Aldehydes and Methyl Cyanoacetate with Sodium Hypophosphite</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we have reported a reaction that allows performing a Knoevenagel condensation, its adduct reduction, and subsequent decarboxylation in a single preparative step using cheap, stable, and convenient sodium hypophosphite. No metal catalyst is required. The reaction is scalable. The limitations of the method are also described in the paper.







Abstract
Saturated carbon chain elongation is a common refrain in numerous synthetic pathways. While the formation of C&#8722;C single bonds is of primary importance in organic synthesis, the simultaneous introduction of functional groups such as nitrile or ester can reasonably increase its practical utility for the preparation of multifunctional products. The Knoevenagel reaction is a powerful tool to create carbon backbones of organic molecules; however, it requires subsequent reduction and/or decarboxylation to achieve a product with a saturated carbon chain. Herein we report a convenient one&#8208;step protocol for the reductive condensation between methyl cyanoacetate and aldehydes in the presence of stable, ecologically benign, cheap and available in bulk amounts sodium hypophosphite as a reductant. A description of both the reaction capabilities and limitations is given in this paper.

         <title>Construction of Sulfur(IV)&#8208;Chiral Six&#8208;Membered Heterocycles by Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric (4+2) Dipolar Cyclization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric (4+2) cyclization was disclosed, providing a modular platform for the synthesis of chiral sulfur(IV)&#8208;containing six&#8208;membered heterocycles. These products enable the enantioselective preparation of a variety of other S&#8208;stereogenic derivatives.







Abstract
Chiral sulfur&#8208;containing compounds play an important role in asymmetric catalysis and synthesis, chiral pharmaceuticals, and chiral materials. While great progress has been made in the synthesis of these compounds, the asymmetric catalytic synthesis of chiral sulfur&#8208;containing heterocycles remains relatively limited compared to acyclic ones. In this study, we successfully report an efficient and highly selective synthesis of structurally diverse chirality&#8208;at&#8208;sulfur(IV) six&#8208;membered heterocycles under mild conditions via a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric (4+2) dipolar cyclization. More importantly, these products enable the enantioselective preparation of a variety of other S&#8208;stereogenic derivatives.

         <title>Photocatalytic Cascade Trifluoromethylation/Cyclization: Selective Synthesis of Trifluoroethylated Benzopyran and Benzopyranone Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic radical cascade cyclization reaction has been developed that enables the one&#8208;step synthesis of rare trifluoroethyl benzopyran derivatives with a wide variety of structures in excellent yields. This oxidant&#8208;free protocol offers several other advantages, including low catalyst loading, high regioselectivity, broad substrate scope, excellent functional group tolerance, and operational simplicity.







Abstract
We have realized a photocatalytic radical cascade cyclization reaction enabling the one&#8208;step synthesis of rare trifluoroethyl benzopyran derivatives with a wide variety of structures in excellent yields. Furthermore, the approach exhibits low catalyst loading, high regioselectivity and wide applicability under mild conditions. The selectivity of this transformation is influenced by the length of the carbon chain of the benzaldehyde, as demonstrated by density functional theory calculations. Additionally, scaling up the photocatalytic process can be readily accomplished.

         <title>Asymmetrically Fused Nanographene&#8211;Porphyrin Architectures</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy to combine three standalone aromatic building blocks in one coherent, fully conjugated molecule is presented. Namely, benzene, pyrene, and hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) are assembled around a central porphyrin core in an ABAC type of geometry and interconnected under oxidative Scholl conditions to achieve merging of the individual &#960;&#8208;systems. The three asymmetric porphyrin conjugates obtained this way exhibit intriguing absorption features, namely strongly red&#8208;shifted and broadened spectra. The presented series of molecules demonstrates the ability to control and influence these optical properties with high precision by altering the size of the aromatic system in a controlled manner. Density functional theory calculations gave more profound insights into the electronic structure and optical transitions of the investigated fused architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Homobarrelenones: Versatile Building Blocks for the Construction of Novel and Structurally Diverse Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Derivatization of tropolone&#8211;based homobarrelenones through hydrogenation, base&#8208;catalyzed solvolysis, and hydride reduction leads to structurally complex and highly functionalized scaffolds. Results from preliminary sperm motility assays underscore the importance of Michael acceptor moieties in the biological activity of this class of compounds.







Abstract
We describe the derivatization of tropolone&#8211;based homobarrelenones through simple transformations, including catalytic hydrogenations, base&#8208;catalyzed solvolysis, and hydride reductions. Despite being structurally complex and highly functionalized, the novel compounds had no significant cytotoxicity in sperm motility assays, underscoring the importance of Michael acceptor moieties in the biological activity of this class of compounds.

         <title>Aryl Radicals Generated from Aryl Pinacol Boronates Modify Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl pinacol boronates generate aryl radicals under aqueous conditions. The formed aryl radicals can be used to functionalize peptide disulfides yielding&#160;S&#8208;arylated products, but they react readily with proteins as well competing with Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling used in bioorthogonal chemical biology applications. The overall reaction does not rely on metal, electro&#8208; or photocatalysis, and reflects the tunable Lewis acidity of organoboronates.







Abstract
We report here a distinct reaction, which generates aryl radicals from aryl pinacol boronates under mild aqueous conditions and can be used for peptide and protein modifications. The strategy leverages the versatile reactivity of aryl pinacol boronates to form aryl radicals in presence of ammonium persulfate (APS). The formed aryl radicals insert readily into peptide disulfide bonds while tolerating other functionalities. On the protein level, the reactivity extends beyond the disulfide bonds. The methodology benefits from the accessibility of starting aryl pinacol boronates, as well as biocompatible conditions. In contrast to conventional methods used for aryl radical generation, the strategy is metal&#8208;free, does not require photoinduction and can be readily performed under aqueous conditions. The mechanism of the reactions was investigated by radical&#8208;trapping experiments, spectroscopic analysis and oxygen scavenging. The presented approach broadens the application of aryl pinacol boronate esters in radical reactions.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular [5+2] Cycloaddition: Highly Regioselective Synthesis of Allene&#8208;Containing 2&#8208;Benzoxepines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the synthesis of allene&#8208;containing 2&#8208;benzoxepines has been developed on the basis of palladium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular [5+2] cycloaddition. The synthetic approach features ready substrate availability, broad substrate scope, satisfactory yields and excellent regioselectivity.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular [5+2] cycloaddition of propargylic carbonates with benzyl allenyl ethers has been developed for the synthesis of allene&#8208;containing 2&#8208;benzoxepines. The reaction proceeds by a pathway involving decarboxylative allenylpalladium formation, regioselective intermolecular insertion, and intramolecular nucleophilic attack. In this way, the sequential formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O bonds results in the generation of a 2&#8208;benzoxepine skeleton in a one&#8208;pot process.

         <title>Highly Diastereoselective Radical Cyclopropanation of Olefins via Cobaloxime&#8208;Based Metalloradical Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobaloxime complexes catalyze highly diastereoselective radical cyclopropanation of olefins with &#945;&#8208;aryl diazoacetates under mild conditions and low catalyst loading. A broad substrate scope including biologically active molecules is tolerated with high yields. This method is also amenable for gram&#8208;scale reactions, showcasing the application of cobaloxime&#8208;catalyzed metalloradical catalysis (MRC) in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Metalloradical catalysis (MRC), predominantly exemplified by metalloporphyrin complexes, has emerged as a promising strategy for regulating radical reactions and broadening their synthetic applications. In this paper, we report that cobaloxime complexes, functioning as a surrogate for metalloporphyrin systems, can mediate radical cyclopropanation of olefins using donor/acceptor&#8208;type carbene precursor &#945;&#8208;aryl diazoacetates through the MRC process. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, yielding cyclopropane derivatives in good yields with high diastereoselectivity. The reaction exhibits extensive substrate tolerance, encompassing gram&#8208;scale transformations and the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. Our discoveries underscore the potential of cobaloxime&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation as a valuable asset in organic syntheses and further expand the repertoire of metalloradical systems in catalysis.

         <title>IMMOBILIZED EOSIN Y ON MODIFIED SILICA NANOPARTICLES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS IN ORGANIC SYNTHESIS</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of novel photocatalytic systems is crucial for advancing sustainable chemical processes in organic synthesis. In this study, we report the preparation, characterization, and application of a heterogeneous photocatalyst based on Eosin Y (EY) covalently immobilized on silica nanoparticles (SNPs). The SNPs&#8208;EY photocatalyst was thoroughly characterized using various techniques, including SEM, TEM, X&#8208;ray diffraction, UV&#8208;vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, solid&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy, XPS, FT&#8208;IR, TGA, and DLS. These analyses confirmed the successful immobilization of EY on SNPs and demonstrated the uniformity and favourable photophysical properties of the resulting hybrid material. The photocatalytic performance of SNPs&#8208;EY was evaluated in a series of model reactions, including aza&#8208;Henry reaction (cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling), reduction of nitrocompounds, and photooxidation of dimethylanthracene. The reaction results demonstrated that SNPs&#8208;EY is an effective and recyclable photocatalyst, offering yields comparable to or higher than those of homogeneous systems, while providing the advantages of easy separation and reuse. This study highlights the potential of SNPs&#8208;EY as a versatile photocatalyst for various organic transformations, promoting the advancement of green and sustainable chemistry</dc:description>

         <title>Application of laser&#8208;generated Au&#8208;Ag/Al2O3 nanoparticle catalysts for the selective catalytic oxidation of 5&#8208;(Hydroxymethyl) furfural to 2,5&#8208;Furan&#8208;dicarboxylic acid</title>

         <dc:description>Conversion of lignocellulosic biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;(Hydroxymethyl) furfural (HMF) into 2,5&#8208;Furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) has a high potential to replace petroleum&#8208;based feedstocks for the production of plastics. In this study, a green synthesis strategy for the selective oxidation of HMF to FDCA is reported by using laser&#8208;generated and specifically designed bimetallic AuAg nanoparticle catalysts supported on Al2O3 using molecular oxygen as oxidant and water as a solvent. Although supported AuAg catalysts are already known as good catalysts for this reaction, the optimal reaction conditions (type of base, reaction temperature, oxygen pressure), Au:Ag composition, role of metal&#8208;support effects and origin of the active site still remain under debate. Interestingly, an Au9Ag1/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited the highest activity with a FDCA yield of up to 66% at 80% HMF conversion. Hereby, NaHCO3 (instead of NaOH) as a smoother base in 2:1 base:HMF ratio, low oxygen pressures of 5 bar, and a mild temperature of 150&#176;C were found optimal. The yield remained fairly stable on reuse of the catalyst for 3 cycles without hints of catalyst sintering or leaching. The titration of surficial hydroxyls on the AuxAgy/Al2O3 surface showed the highest density of acidic hydroxyls for the most active Au9Ag1/Al2O3 catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Preliminary In&#8208;vitro Activity of 6&#8208;Hydroxyalkyl &#946;&#8208;Carboline Derivatives for the Development of Drug Conjugates Targeting MDM2</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mouse&#8208;double&#8208;minute&#8208;2 (MDM2) protein, the main downregulator of the tumor suppressor p53 protein, represents a promising target for the development of novel anticancer therapies. However, the lack of selectivity and poor effectiveness in tumors bearing mutated&#8208;p53 impaired the approval of several MDM2 inhibitors for the market. In this context, the possibility of generating drug&#8208;conjugates within a MDM2 inhibitor is a growing research area aimed to overcome these drawbacks. Considering the promising MDM2 inhibition by the &#946;&#8208;carboline&#8208;based 1, in this work we explored the introduction of a new functionalization on it for a future conjugation while preserving its anticancer properties. Based on preliminary docking studies, we synthesized derivatives 2a&#8208;d having linear hydroxyalkyl chains with different lengths at the 6&#8208;position of the &#946;&#8208;carboline core, which effectively preserved the submicromolar IC50 on wild&#8208;type&#8208;p53&#8208;U87MG glioblastoma cell line observed with 1. Candidates 2a,d showed the functionalization was tolerated with respect of bioactivity also on mutated&#8208;p53&#8208;U138MG glioblastoma cell line, and their hydroxyl groups proved to be easily accessible when coupled to 4&#8208;pentynoic&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylethylenediamine affording derivatives 10a,d with high yields. In summary, our results led to generating novel 6&#8208;hydroxyalkyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carboline compounds displaying a suitable hydroxyl&#8208;site useful to improve the efficacy and/or the tumor specificity of 1 through conjugation strategies.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The mouse-double-minute-2 (MDM2) protein, the main downregulator of the tumor suppressor p53 protein, represents a promising target for the development of novel anticancer therapies. However, the lack of selectivity and poor effectiveness in tumors bearing mutated-p53 impaired the approval of several MDM2 inhibitors for the market. In this context, the possibility of generating drug-conjugates within a MDM2 inhibitor is a growing research area aimed to overcome these drawbacks. Considering the promising MDM2 inhibition by the &#946;-carboline-based 1, in this work we explored the introduction of a new functionalization on it for a future conjugation while preserving its anticancer properties. Based on preliminary docking studies, we synthesized derivatives 2a-d having linear hydroxyalkyl chains with different lengths at the 6-position of the &#946;-carboline core, which effectively preserved the submicromolar IC50 on wild-type-p53-U87MG glioblastoma cell line observed with 1. Candidates 2a,d showed the functionalization was tolerated with respect of bioactivity also on mutated-p53-U138MG glioblastoma cell line, and their hydroxyl groups proved to be easily accessible when coupled to 4-pentynoic-N,N&#8217;-dimethylethylenediamine affording derivatives 10a,d with high yields. In summary, our results led to generating novel 6-hydroxyalkyl-&#946;-carboline compounds displaying a suitable hydroxyl-site useful to improve the efficacy and/or the tumor specificity of 1 through conjugation strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Alkyne&#8208; and azide&#8208;functionalised cyclophellitol derivatives for selective glucuronidase targeting</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heparanase is an endo&#8208;acting &#946;&#8208;glucuronidase and the only known enzyme responsible for the regulation of heparan sulfate structures in the extracellular matrix. The enzyme is found to be significantly upregulated in aggressive cancer types, aiding cell proliferation by liberation of growth factors, increasing angiogenesis and metastasis. Despite much interest in the development of inhibitors to control this activity, no compound targeting heparanase has yet reached the clinic. While mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors derived from the epoxide carbocycle cyclophellitol are very potent enzyme inactivators, one challenge in their development is in achieving selectivity for heparanase over related glycosidases. We here present the synthesis of three cyclophellitol scaffolds presenting azide and alkyne handles at key positions, which are amenable to facile elaboration via copper&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions to aid in exploring the structure&#8208;activity relationship for selective inhibitors of heparanase.</dc:description>

         <title>Xanthone Synthesis through Catalysis: Exploring the Green Limits of Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Methods</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores recent advancements in the synthesis of xanthones, focusing on the transition from stoichiometric to catalytic methodologies, including homogeneous and heterogeneous approaches. Key environmental metrics, solvent selection, and reaction steps, among others, are analysed, showcasing the potential of modern catalytic techniques to develop greener synthetic processes.







Abstract
The transition from traditional stoichiometric methods to catalytic processes has significantly advanced the synthesis of xanthones, privileged structures with diverse biological activities. This review critically examines various homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic methodologies, emphasising their efficiency, and adherence to green chemistry principles. Through comparative analysis of key metrics such as Reaction Mass Efficiency (RME), Process Mass Intensity (PMI), E&#8208;factor, and Turnover Number (TON), we highlight the superior performance of heterogeneous catalysts, which demonstrate high reusability, selectivity, and minimal waste generation. The choice of solvent, a crucial factor in the environmental footprint of these processes, is also assessed, focusing on greener alternatives. The robust nature and economic viability of heterogeneous catalysts make them ideal for large&#8208;scale applications, offering suitable solutions for more environmentally&#8208;friendly xanthone production. Furthermore, the reduction in by&#8208;products and the importance of catalyst purity in pharmaceutical applications are discussed, underscoring the relevance of these advancements in meeting the rigorous standards of the industry. This review provides valuable insights into the ongoing evolution of catalytic strategies in xanthone synthesis, driving future developments in medicinal chemistry and green chemistry.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report an efficient scandium&#8208;catalytic reaction protocol for the classical Fischer indole synthesis, which can tolerate a wide variety of polycyclic substrates and allow us to easily construct complex indole structures in high yields for most cases. Moreover, in order to demonstrate the reaction efficacy, we also synthesized two quinazolinone&#8208;containing natural alkaloids, their analog, as well as an anticancer indenoindolone compound.

Using &#945;&#8208;bromo ketones and acetylenedicarboxylate as the respective reactive partners, the [5+1] and [5+2] cycloaddition reactions with isoquinolinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolates facilitate the construction of isoquinoline&#8208;fused thiazine and seven&#8208;membered N, S&#8208;heterocyclic frameworks under mild conditions. This cycloaddition approach exhibits exceptional substrate versatility and tolerance towards diverse functional groups.







Abstract
Two cycloaddition modes of isoquinolinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolates have been established. Upon choosing &#945;&#8208;bromo ketones as the counterpart, a range of isoquinoline&#8208;fused thiazines can be attained with yields ranging from moderate to excellent through a formal [5+1] reaction pathway, exhibiting remarkable substrate adaptability and resilience to diverse functional groups. Additionally, a library of unprecedented thiazepino[5,4&#8208;a]isoquinolines, a novel category of seven&#8208;membered heterocycles, has been synthesized via a [5+2] pathway utilizing acetylenedicarboxylate as the reactive component. Notably, this reaction process stands out for its exceptional 100&#8201;% atomic utilization efficiency.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C4,C5&#8208;Diarylation of Isoxazole&#8208;3&#8208;Carboxylate by Double C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization</title>

         <dc:description>
Conditions for the palladium&#8208;catalyzed C4,C5&#8208;diarylation of ethyl isoxazole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylate through double C&#8722;H bond activation are reported. This methodology, which employs commercially available substrates, an inexpensive base and an air&#8208;stable catalyst, provides simple one&#8208;pot access to a wide variety of C4,C5&#8208;diarylated isoxazoles, allowing straightforward tuning of their properties.







Abstract
The Pd&#8208;catalyzed C4&#8208;arylation of 3,5&#8208;disubstituted isoxazoles via C&#8722;H bond functionalization has been largely described. By contrast, the reactivity of isoxazoles in C&#8722;H bond functionalization with both unsubstituted C4 and C5 positions remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report on the reactivity in Pd&#8208;catalyzed double C&#8722;H bond arylation of an isoxazole with unsubstituted C4 and C5 positions. Conditions for the palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct C4,C5&#8208;diarylation of ethyl isoxazole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylate using aryl bromides as the aryl source are reported. This procedure tolerates several useful substituents on the aryl bromide such as nitrile, acetyl, formyl, benzoyl, alkoxycarbonyl, chloro, fluoro, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, cyanomethyl, tertbutyl and methoxy at para&#8208; and meta&#8208;positions. Conversely, with ortho&#8208;substituted aryl bromides, mixtures of mono&#8208; and di&#8208;arylated isoxazoles were generally obtained. This methodology provides a simple one pot access to a wide variety of C4,C5&#8208;diarylated isoxazoles from commercially available substrates allowing to modify easily their biological properties.

         <title>An Oxidative SNH Alkylamination of 5(6,7,8)&#8208;Nitroquinoline N&#8208;Oxides in Aqueous Dioxane Medium</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel approach to synthesize otherwise inaccessible 2&#8208;alkylaminoquinoline derivatives in moderate to excellent yields. The reaction is based on direct oxidative substitution of hydrogen and, unusually for a Chichibabin reaction, proceeds easily under mild conditions and in an aqueous environment. The synthesis is scalable. Some products were investigated for their antibacterial activity.







Abstract
A novel and efficient method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;alkylamino and 2&#8208;dialkylamino derivatives of N&#8208;oxides of 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, 7&#8208; and 8&#8208;nitroquinolines, which can potentially exhibit biological activity, as containing a pharmacophoric quinoline fragment, is described herein. The reactions of 5(6,7,8)&#8208;nitroquinoline N&#8208;oxides with various primary or secondary amines in the presence of potassium ferricyanide at in aqueous dioxane medium afforded the corresponding secondary and tertiary amines in moderate to excellent yields. This reaction is the first example of a Chichibabin reaction leading to the formation of 2&#8208;alkylaminoquinoline derivatives at position 2 under mild conditions. A study of the antibacterial activity of some products was carried out.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Multipath Compact Cyclophanes for Quantum Interference Studies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic model compounds with two parallel conductance paths are reported. Preliminary single molecule transport studies reflect the impact of substitution patterns of the different pathways. From a synthetic viewpoint interesting, the fragility of the thiophene model compounds required the consideration of alternative protection group strategies.







Abstract
To investigate interference phenomena and conductance properties in mechanically controlled break junctions (MCBJs), macrocycles 1 and 2 (BMCs: for BenzeneMacroCycles), containing a meta&#8208;substituted benzene moiety with solubilizing tert&#8208;butyl groups, as well as structures 3 and 4 (TMCs: for ThiopheneMacroCycles), featuring 2,5&#8208;connected 3,4&#8208;hexyl&#8208;thiophene corners, were synthesized. Macrocycles 1 and 2 respectively 3 and 4 differ in the positions of the acetyl&#8208;protected sulfur anchoring groups, which impacts both, the individual transport efficiency of their parallel electronic pathways and their overall molecular wire lengths. All macrocycles were synthesized based on a series of Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reactions. For 3 and 4, a 2&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridinyl)ethyl protecting group for the sulfur atoms was successful, while for macrocycles 1 and 2 the more common tert&#8208;butyl protecting group did the job. To our delight, proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept charge transport studies conducted in an MCBJ setup demonstrated the expected trends regarding improved conductance intensities for the TMCs compared to the BMCs. Furthermore, the corresponding molecular plateaus from the breaking experiments were in the expected length range of the S&#8722;S distances for all compounds. We also found that the overall conductance seems to follow a more complex transport mechanism than just the sum of contributions from both channels.

         <title>Structurally Innovative Benzimidazole&#8208;fused Ionic Organoselenium Compounds: Prevalence of Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N/Se Chalcogen Bonds with the Selenocyanate Receptor</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen Bond. Presence of Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N or Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se chalcogen bonds are highlighted in the structurally innovative benzimidazole&#8208;fused cyclic selenazonium selenocyanates, cyclic selenazinium selenocyanates and the acyclic benzimidazolium analogs having two different types of selenocyanate units. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures of the compounds revealed the participation of both N and Se atoms of the SeCN counterions as ChB acceptors in building the Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N or Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se ChB interactions.







Abstract
The non&#8208;covalent interactions in molecules play important roles towards their applications in various aspects such as molecular recognition, catalysis, supramolecular chemistry, structural biology, pharmacology etc. Interestingly, among various non&#8208;bonding interactions, chalcogen bonding (ChB) has been extensively studied in different facets of crystal engineering over the last several years. The present study demonstrates the presence of Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N or Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se ChB in the benzimidazole&#8208;fused cyclic selenazonium selenocyanates (6&#8211;8), cyclic selenazinium selenocyanates (9&#8211;10) and the acyclic benzimidazolium analogs having two different types of selenocyanate units (11&#8211;12). The final organoselenium compounds were synthesized from benzimidazole in several steps in reasonably good yields. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures of the compounds revealed that both the N atom and Se atom of the negatively charged SeCN unit act as ChB acceptors in building the Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N or Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se ChB interactions along with the additional hydrogen bonding (HB) interactions. Moreover, the structural optimization and natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses were carried out using density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the natural charges on different Se centers and the strength of second&#8208;order perturbation energy (E2) for the ChB interactions. Finally, surface electrostatic potential (SEP) of the compounds was developed to visualize the formation of &#963;&#8208;holes.

         <title>Construction of Spiro Systems from Tetrathiafulvalene Derivatives by a Pinacol&#8208;Like Rearrangement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pinacol&#8208;like rearrangement of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives was found to yield spiro compounds under mild conditions with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine oxide (TEMPO) as a key reagent. The influence of various substituents was examined, and the mechanism was analyzed in detail. The findings highlight the broad applicability and selectivity of this transformation, offering valuable insight for the design of new TTF&#8208;based molecules.

An efficient and generalized pinacol&#8208;like rearrangement of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives has been achieved using 2, 2, 6, 6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine oxide (TEMPO) as a key reagent, in place of a traditional metal catalyst. Examination of numerous TTF derivatives demonstrates the reaction's exceptional tolerance to a variety of substituents, achieving an overall yield of up to 97&#8201;%. The optimization of reaction conditions and evaluation of reaction applicability were achieved by varying factors such as the first redox potentials (E11/2) of the substrate molecule, substituent type, substituent position, number of substituents, and structural symmetry. Additionally, the reaction mechanism was explored using isotopic labeling, real&#8208;time monitoring UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Specifically, TTF is oxidized to TTF+&#8901; by p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH&#8901;H2O). TTF+&#8901; subsequently reacts with TEMPO and H2O to form a pinacol&#8208;like intermediate, which undergoes a rearrangement to release a 2, 2, 6, 6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;ol (TEMPOH) molecule, forming the rearranged product as a hydrogenated cation, this intermediate undergoes deprotonation, leading to the formation of the final spiro product. This investigation led to the identification of a class of reactions for the efficient conversion of TTF derivatives into their spiro products via pinacol&#8208;like rearrangement reaction.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Axially Diaryl Aldehydes by Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Desymmetrization Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axially chiral biaryl aldehydes are esteemed as valuable precursors for the development of innovative chiral catalysts, playing a pivotal role across a broad spectrum of research disciplines.The synthesis of axially chiral biaryl aldehydes with various structural features has been developed by reacting biaryl dialdehyde with aromatic amine in the presence of chiral phosphoric acid (CPA). It shows excellent enantioselectivity, mild conditions and good compatibility with different functional groups. These structures serve as promising precursors for a range of subsequent chemical transformations and are likely to have potential applications in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral ligands or catalysts.







Abstract
Axially chiral biaryl aldehydes are precursors for the synthesis of axially chiral compounds and novel chiral catalysts of great interest, which play vital roles in extensive research fields. However, limited strategies exist for the efficient synthesis of axially chiral aldehydes, and the construction of structurally diverse axially chiral aldehydes remains challenging. Herein, a strategy is reported for the synthesis of biaryl axially chiral aldehydes with varying structures from biaryl dialdehydes and aromatic amines in the presence of a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst. This protocol features excellent enantioselectivity, mild conditions, and good functional&#8208;group tolerance.

Herein, we develop an efficient approach to the chemical synthesis of well&#8208;defined &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;mannurarate di&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, hexa&#8208; and octasaccharides with purported anti&#8208;Alzheimer's activity, utilizing N&#8208;phenyl trifluoroacetimidate donors and thioglycoside acceptors for the stereoselective assembly of the desired &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;mannuronate linkages.







Abstract
Sodium oligomannate, a sophisticated mixture of acidic linear &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;oligomannurarate ranging from dimers to decamers with an average molecular weight of 670&#8764;880&#8197;Da, has gained conditional approval for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we develop an efficient approach to the chemical synthesis of well&#8208;defined &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;mannurarate di&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, hexa&#8208; and octasaccharides (1&#8211;4), utilizing N&#8208;phenyl trifluoroacetimidate donors and thioglycoside acceptors for the stereoselective assembly of the desired &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;mannuronate linkages. This approach features a straightforward protecting group strategy with only two types of protecting groups: tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) for the 4&#8208;OH at the non&#8208;reducing end and benzyl (Bn) for free hydroxyl and carboxylic acid moieties, thereby ensuring the stereoselective formation of the &#946;&#8208;mannosyl bonds and facilitating sequential transformation into the target &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;mannurarate oligosaccharides. The scalability of the present synthesis of these oligosaccharides paves the way for in&#8208;depth structure&#8208;activity relationship studies and pharmacological investigations of sodium oligomannates.

         <title>Filling the Gap within 10&#8208;Membered Heteroenediynes: Thiaenediyne &#8211; An Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiaenediyne, as a member of the heteroenediynes fused to a benzothiophene core, was synthesized using the S&#8208;type Nicholas cyclization. NBO analysis was used to demonstrate the primary role of the heteroatom in an enediyne core for the reactivity of enediynes in the Bergman cyclization.







Abstract
The heteroatom nature in 10&#8208;membered enediynes plays a crucial role in tuning of their reactivity in the Bergman cyclization, which is a decisive factor for the biological activity of enediynes. Although benzothiophene&#8208;fused O&#8208; and N&#8208;enediynes have been identified as promising biological objects, the corresponding thiaenediyne remains unknown. To fill this gap, we synthesized the thiaanalog and studied it in both practical and theoretical terms. While the Nicholas reaction has proven to be an effective cyclization technique for the preparation of heteroenediynes, in the case of thiaenediyne it was accompanied by an unusual acid&#8208;promoted intramolecular cyclization, forming a thiepinium salt. The S&#8208;enediyne has reduced reactivity in the Bergman cyclization relative to the N&#8208; and O&#8208;enediynes, attributed to the diminished alkyne bending and extended cd&#8208;distance. The NBO analysis of the entire series, namely the evaluation of &#960;in/out(C2&#8208;CC)&#8594;&#963;*(C&#8722;X) hyperconjugation, revealed that the S atom in S&#8208;enediyne provides stronger stabilization of the initial compound than the N atom in N&#8208;enediyne, while exhibiting the weakest stabilization of the Bergman cyclization transition state. NICS values were employed to examine the change in aromaticity along the Bergman cyclization coordinate. This approach, in conjunction with the NBO analysis, provides a foundation for further rational design of unnatural enediynes.

         <title>NHC&#8208;Catalyzed, Microwave&#8208;Assisted and Base&#8208;Dependent Reactions of Substituted Cinnamaldehydes Towards &#947;&#8208;Lactones or Saturated Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
10 NHCs were used as organocatalysts using microwacve irradiation and depending on the base used to generate the free carbene, &#947;&#8208;lactones or saturated esters were prepared from aryl&#8208;substituted cinnamaldehydes. Novel NHC hydrochloride salts and &#947;&#8208;lactones are reported together with the optimum reaction conditions and the broad scope of both reactions.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) generated from imidazolium, imidazopyridinium and imidazoquinolinium hydrochlorides in&#8197;situ using base and microwave irradiation were employed as organocatalysts to yield homoenolates from cinnamaldehyde and its aryl&#8208;substituted analogs. Depending on the catalytic base either &#947;&#8208;lactones were prepared when the strong base tBuOK was used or the corresponding saturated ethyl 3&#8208;aryl propionates were synthesized with the milder DIPEA base. Novel imidazopyridinium and imidazoquinolinium hydrochlorides were synthesized and were compared to commercially available NHCs IMes and IDip for their catalytic activity. The optimum reaction conditions were established using IMes and the broad scope of both reactions was investigated using the 4 most efficient NHCs.

         <title>Convergent Synthesis of Antitumor Aplysiatoxin Derivatives Based on a Combination of Ring&#8208;Closing and Cross Metathesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated a convergent synthesis of aplysiatoxin analogs based on a combination of ring&#8208;closing and cross metathesis. Synthetic analogs with different side chains revealed that a naphthol moiety did not improve binding to protein kinase C (PKC)&#8208;C1 domains, suggesting that the hydrogen bonding of the hydroxy group with the PKC&#8722;C1 domains may be more important than the CH/&#960; interaction.







Abstract
We investigated a convergent synthesis of aplysiatoxin analogs based on a combination of ring&#8208;closing and cross metathesis. The route provided four analogs (3&#8201;a&#8211;d) with different side chains to determine the CH/&#960; interaction with protein kinase C (PKC)&#8208;C1 domains. Biochemical evaluation revealed that a naphthol moiety did not improve binding to PKC&#8722;C1 domains, suggesting that the hydrogen bonding of the hydroxy group with the PKC&#8722;C1 domains may be more important than the CH/&#960; interaction.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, Spectral and Redox Properties of Phenoxazine Embedded Heteroporphyrins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenoxazine embedded heteroporphyrins containing one phenoxazine, two pyrroles and one heterocycle (furan, thiophene, selenophene or telluorophene) connected by four meso carbon atoms were synthesized, and their structure and electronic properties were compared with those of previously reported phenothiazine embedded heteroporphyrins.







Abstract
A series of phenoxazine embedded heteroporphyrins containing one phenoxazine, two pyrroles and one heterocycle, such as furan, thiophene, selenophene and telluorophene, connected by four meso carbon atoms were synthesized by condensing one equivalent of phenoxazine&#8208;based tripyrrane with one equivalent of the appropriate 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl&#8208;p&#8208;tolyl) heterocycle under acid&#8208;catalyzed conditions, and their structure, spectral and electrochemical properties were compared with those of previously reported phenothiazine embedded heteroporphyrins. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the phenoxazine embedded selenoporphyrin revealed that the selenophene ring, which is opposite the phenoxazine moiety, points outward from the macrocyclic core, and the phenoxazine unit deviated by an angle of 39.47&#176; from the mean plane defined by the four meso carbons atoms. The replacement of the phenothiazine unit in phenothiazine embedded heteroporphyrins with a phenoxazine unit led to significant alteration of the electronic properties of the macrocycles, as reflected in their spectral and electrochemical properties. The absorption spectra of phenoxazine embedded heteroporphyrins showed bathochromically shifted absorption bands, hypsochromically shifted fluorescence bands with decent quantum yields, more facile oxidation and more difficult reduction as compared to the corresponding phenothiazine embedded heteroporphyrins. DFT and TD&#8208;DFT studies were in support of the experimental observations.

         <title>Relative Stability and Basicity of Enamines from Aminocatalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relative stability of two series of enamines was examined using DFT (mainly M06&#8208;2X), MP2, and CCSD(T) calculations. A basicity scale for enamines derived from pyrrolidine and carbonyl compounds was then established. Another basicity scale was obtained for a second series of enamines, from propanal and various aminocatalysts.







Abstract
The relative thermodynamic stability of two series of enamines has been examined using DFT (mainly M06&#8208;2X), MP2, and CCSD(T) calculations, supplemented by 1H NMR spectroscopy in some cases. The basicity of enamines derived from pyrrolidine and various carbonyl compounds has been computationally compared in the gas phase and in water; the results indicate which enamines or iminium ions may predominate in nonpolar and polar acidic media when pyrrolidine and two or more carbonyl groups or carbonyl compounds are present in the reaction flask. The relative basicity of a second series of enamines, from propanal and chiral pyrrolidines or imidazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones, has also been investigated; this sheds light on the main intermediates that should be expected when two or more secondary amines are present in acid&#8208;catalyzed aldehyde reactions. Non&#8208;covalent interactions explain the stability of folded side&#8208;chain conformers of O&#8208;silylated prolinol enamines, according to the predictions of M06&#8211;2X, &#969;B97X&#8722;D, and B3LYP&#8722;D3 (but not B3LYP). The significant stability of iminium ions containing appropriate electron&#8208;donating atoms or groups accounts for the basicity of the corresponding enamines. These findings pave the way for the future development of dual aminocatalytic processes.

         <title>Tunable and Selective Transformation of Aromatic Thioether Enabled by Regulating Active Species Under Visible Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the effective regulation of active species, the controllable upgrading transformations of aryl alkyl sulfides under mild conditions have been achieved by a pyridinium photocatalyst, which are ROS&#8208;dominated aerobic oxidation and the chlorine radical&#8208;mediated C(sp3)&#8722;S bond cleavage, revealing the great potential of pyridinium molecules in photocatalytic field.







Abstract
Through effective regulation of active species in photocatalytic process, the oxidation or C(sp3)&#8722;S bond cleavage upgrading of widespread aryl alkyl sulfides under mild conditions was successfully achieved by using a pyridinium photocatalyst. Benefiting from the excellent redox ability of the photocatalyst, the electron transfer between the pyridinium molecule and the substrate, molecular oxygen, or counter&#8208;anion effectively promotes the conversion and upgrading of the substrate thioether. Among them, the efficient generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) enables the highly selective oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides under visible light and air atmosphere. More importantly, the chlorine radical (Cl&#8901;) generated by electron transfer, reported for the first time, contributes to the cleavage of C(sp3)&#8722;S bonds, achieving the transformation of aryl alkyl sulfides to disulfides. By harnessing the superior photocatalytic ability of pyridinium molecules, this work not only achieves the highly selective conversion of thioether by taming the active species in the photocatalytic process, but also sheds light on the untapped potential of chlorine radicals in the field of C(sp3)&#8722;S bond activation and cleavage.

         <title>Structural Modifications on Dopamine Molecules toward Polydopamine Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into the structural modifications of dopamine in the organic chemistry level to enhance polydopamine (PDA) coatings. By altering the catechol moiety and aliphatic amines, researchers aim to improve PDA's adhesive properties and expand its applicability across various surfaces. The study highlights the significance of these modifications in optimizing PDA for diverse applications.







Abstract
Polydopamine (PDA) is a synthetic material synthesized through the oxidative self&#8208;polymerization of dopamine under alkaline conditions. This material emulates the adhesive properties of mussel foot proteins, allowing the formation of robust and stable organic coatings on various surfaces. Researchers have attempted to identify and improve the surface&#8208;coating properties of PDA by incorporating additional organic functional groups. This review explores the structural modifications of dopamine molecules at the organic chemistry level, with a focus on changes in the catechol moiety and aliphatic amines, and examines their impact on the applications of PDA. The flexibility of these modifications underscores their importance for optimizing PDA coatings for a wide range of applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Highly Fluorescent Thiazole Fused Benzo[a] Carbazoles by Sunlight Driven Photocyclization of Indolylthiazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sunlight&#8208;driven, irreversible photocyclization reaction of indole&#8208;linked trisubstituted thiazoles has been reported for the synthesis of thiazole&#8208;fused benzo[a]carbazoles. The Key features of this method include the use of sun light as the source of energy, catalyst&#8208;free conditions and presence of medicinally important thiazole and carbazole moieties. Most of these synthesized products show very good fluorescence quantum yields.







Abstract
Herein we report for the first time a sunlight&#8208;driven, irreversible photocyclization reaction of indole&#8208;linked trisubstituted thiazoles, for the synthesis of highly fluorescent thiazole&#8208;fused benzo[a]carbazoles using a mixture of solvents (CH3CN: DMSO; 3&#8201;:&#8201;1). Ring opening of indole moiety was observed in the case of thiazole derivatives having 2&#8208;methyl indole substituents. Under similar reaction conditions, photocyclization of trisubstituted thiazoles having cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls in place of indole moiety also worked. This reaction provides products having two medicinally important moieties thiazole and benzocarbazoles. We have studied the photophysical properties of all the products and found that most of the synthesized products have very good fluorescence quantum yields.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Synthesis of Pyrazolo&#8208;Sulfonamide: Impact of Solvent on Nitro&#8208;Pyrazole Reactivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a copper&#8208;catalyzed, solvent&#8208;dependent route for the rapid and efficient synthesis of N&#8208;pyrazolo&#8208;sulfonamides directly from nitro&#8208;pyrazole and sulfonyl hydrazide under microwave conditions. Solvent dependent reactivity and remarkable chemoslectivity are some of the key features of this method. Further utility of the process is demonstrated by the sulfaphenazole analogue and sulfonamide nucleoside synthesis.







Abstract
This study presents a copper&#8208;catalyzed, solvent&#8208;dependent method for the rapid and efficient synthesis of N&#8208;pyrazolo&#8208;sulfonamides directly from nitro&#8208;pyrazole and sulfonyl hydrazide under microwave conditions. The reaction exhibits notable solvent effects in pyrazole's reactivity. The ionic liquid DBU&#8208;AcOH triggered the reactivity of 4&#8208;nitro&#8208;pyrazole, whereas the reaction in PEG proceeded selectively at the 3&#8208; &amp; 5&#8208;positions of pyrazole. Key applications of this method include the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of pyrazolo&#8208;sulfonamide, sulfaphenazole analogue and sulfonamide nucleoside.

         <title>Developments in the Construction of Benzo[b]Thiophenes from 2&#8208;Alkynylthioanisoles by Electrophilic and Radical Cyclization Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzo[b]thiophene moieties are important skeletons which have been widely found in many natural products, pharmaceuticals, as well as functionalized materials. This review summarizes the developments in the construction of benzo[b]thiophene skeletons from 2&#8208;alkynylthioanisoles by electrophilic and radical cyclization reactions.







Abstract
Benzo[b]thiophene moieties are important skeletons which have been widely found in many natural products, pharmaceuticals, as well as functionalized materials. 2&#8208;Alkynylthioanisoles, a class of bifunctional compounds bearing methylthio and alkynyl groups, are easily accessible from Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira coupling between 2&#8208;halothioanisoles and terminal alkynes, which have been widely employed as synthons in the construction of benzo[b]thiophenes through an electrophilic or a radical pathway. This review summarizes the related developments with a particular focus on the reaction mechanism. We hope it will help in future research in this area and believe that with the discovery of new catalytic systems, the industrial synthesis of benzo[b]thiophenes from 2&#8208;alkynylthioanisoles will be achieved soon.

         <title>Syntheses and Properties of Two Isomeric Phenanthroacephenanthrylene Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described herein are the syntheses and properties of two phenanthroacephenanthrylene regioisomers as the new non&#8208;alternant cyclopenta&#8208;fused polyaromatic analogs of alternant dibenzoperylene polyaromatics.







Abstract
Cyclopenta&#8208;annulated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (CP&#8208;PAHs) are of significant interest due to their unique optoelectronic properties and applications in organic electronic devices. Phenanthroacephenanthrylene (PAP) isomers are CP&#8208;PAHs that have been rarely investigated, and only the [9,10&#8208;e]PAP isomer was explored to date. Herein, we report the syntheses, crystal structure and optoelectronic properties of two PAP isomers, 7&#8208;ethoxy[2,1&#8208;e]PAP 1 and 9&#8208;ethoxy[1,2&#8208;e]PAP 2. The structural isomers were synthesized in multi&#8208;steps, and structural elucidations were performed using NMR, mass, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, revealing planar backbone of the isomers. UV&#8208;visible absorption and fluorescence spectra of compound 1 were red&#8208;shifted than that of 2, suggesting smaller HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap which is further validated by DFT calculations that suggested the lowering of HOMO&#8211;LUMO spacing could be attributed to the greater destabilization of HOMO for 1.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches for the Construction of Chiral Aziridines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optically active aziridines represent an important class of rigid three&#8208;membered nitrogen&#8208;heterocyclics because they are privileged structural frameworks in biologically and pharmacologically relevant natural products. This review is to summarize complementary assembly of optically active aziridines in recent years, as well as their applications in the agrochemical and pharmaceutical industry.







Abstract
Optically active aziridines represent a pivotal class of rigid three&#8208;membered nitrogen&#8208;heterocyclic compounds found in natural products, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and functional motifs, which have demonstrated outstanding practicability as therapeutic molecular frameworks, versatile synthetic endpoints, and functional materials in both academic and industrial communities. Recent years have witnessed a broad spectrum of prominent breakthroughs in the field of chiral aziridines due to the aziridine&#8208;based rigid and three&#8208;dimensional pharmacophores, which have resulted in streamlining the drug discovery process. Over the past few decades, particular attention has been directed towards the strategically efficient, versatile, and practical assembly of optically active aziridines. These synthesis approaches have demonstrated great potential in the context of the construction of pharmaceutical molecules, biologically and pharmacologically relevant natural products, and functional materials. In this review, several synthetic strategies for the assembly of chiral aziridines are summarized, which could be divided into five categories: (1) Introduction; (2) Construction of optically active aziridines via reactions of olefines with nitrene sources; (3) Construction of optically active aziridines via reactions of imines with carbenes; (4) Construction of optically active aziridines via reaction of azirines; (5) Construction of optically active aziridines via intramolecular cyclization of amine derivatives.

&lt;p&gt;Optically active aziridines represent an important class of rigid three-membered nitrogen-heterocyclics because they are privileged structural frameworks in biologically and pharmacologically relevant natural products. This review is to summarize complementary assembly of optically active aziridines in recent years, as well as their applications in the agrochemical and pharmaceutical industry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optically active aziridines represent a pivotal class of rigid three-membered nitrogen-heterocyclic compounds found in natural products, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and functional motifs, which have demonstrated outstanding practicability as therapeutic molecular frameworks, versatile synthetic endpoints, and functional materials in both academic and industrial communities. Recent years have witnessed a broad spectrum of prominent breakthroughs in the field of chiral aziridines due to the aziridine-based rigid and three-dimensional pharmacophores, which have resulted in streamlining the drug discovery process. Over the past few decades, particular attention has been directed towards the strategically efficient, versatile, and practical assembly of optically active aziridines. These synthesis approaches have demonstrated great potential in the context of the construction of pharmaceutical molecules, biologically and pharmacologically relevant natural products, and functional materials. In this review, several synthetic strategies for the assembly of chiral aziridines are summarized, which could be divided into five categories: (1) Introduction; (2) Construction of optically active aziridines via reactions of olefines with nitrene sources; (3) Construction of optically active aziridines via reactions of imines with carbenes; (4) Construction of optically active aziridines via reaction of azirines; (5) Construction of optically active aziridines via intramolecular cyclization of amine derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Catalytic Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Bromo Aryl Acetic Acids by Late&#8208;Stage Bromination</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boron&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;bromination of aryl acetic acids via an enediolate intermediate is presented. This method yields a variety of aryl acetic acids with yields ranging from 19&#8201;% to 65&#8201;%, including three examples of dibrominated products. Furthermore, the reaction can be scaled up to the gram scale, and several transformations of the resulting products have been performed.







Abstract
We report a catalytic late&#8208;stage bromination strategy for the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of aryl acetic acid. The aryl acetic acid was transformed into enediolate in the presence of an (AcO)4B2O with the combination of DBU, and consequently underwent an electrophilic bromination reaction with pyridinium tribromide. A wide range of &#945;&#8208;bromo aryl acetic acids were isolated in yields of 19&#8211;65&#8201;%. In addition, the reaction could be performed on a gram scale, and several transformations of the products were carried out.

         <title>Organocatalytic Atroposelective C&#8722;H Amination of Arenes with Indolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral N&#8208;arylindolines has been established via nucleophilic amination of arenes with 7&#8208;substituted indolines.







Abstract
An atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral N&#8208;arylindolines has been established by organocatalytic nucleophilic amination of arenes with 7&#8208;substituted indolines, providing a straightforward way to achieve the expected C&#8722;N atropisomers in good yields (up to 95&#8201;%) with good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 97&#8201;% ee) from readily available starting materials. Furthermore, axially chiral N&#8208;arylindole derivatives could be prepared upon oxidative aromatization of the corresponding N&#8208;arylindolines.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and efficient method has been developed to access sulfone&#8208;containing 1,3&#8208;enynes through a palladium&#8208;catalyzed domino radical sulfonylation and alkynylation of simple alkynes.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed domino radical sulfonylation and alkynylation of simple alkynes has been developed for the rapid construction of privileged scaffolds containing sulfone and 1,3&#8208;enyne motifs. The reaction of sulfonyl iodide with simple alkynes proceeded smoothly under mild conditions to afford a variety of sulfone&#8208;containing 1,3&#8208;enynes in good yields and with excellent selectivities.

         <title>Chiral Secondary Phosphine Oxide Ligands in Asymmetric Ni&#8722;Al Bimetallic Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligands play a key role in asymmetric transition&#8208;metal catalysis. Among reported chiral ligands, readily available and air&#8208;stable phosphine oxide ligands are unique and have aroused wide interest, especially in Ni&#8722;Al bimetallic catalysis, since they can act as bifunctional ligands to ligate two metals for stronger bimetallic synergism, greatly enhancing reactivity and selectivity. Hence, in this mini review we will focus on phosphine oxides and their applications in asymmetric Ni&#8722;Al bimetallic catalysis.

         <title>On the Halogenation of Tyrosine N&#8208;Oxime Methyl Ester</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient syntheses of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and heterodihalogenated derivatives of tyrosine N&#8208;oxime methyl ester are reported. Monohalogenation with N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS), N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide (NCS) or N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS) was optimized by addition of acid to suppress dihalogenation, affording bromo, chloro, and iodo derivatives in 71%, 50&#8208;53%, and 78&#8208;80% yields, respectively. Homodihalogenation utilized a two&#8208;step, one&#8208;flask process via a spirocyclic intermediate, yielding dibromo, dichloro, and diiodo analogues, respectively (75&#8208;76%, 54&#8208;56%, 79&#8208;80%). This strategy was extended to synthesize heterodihalogenated bromochloro, bromoiodo, and chloroiodo derivatives from monohalogenated analogues (50&#8208;77%). Key to this approach was the formation of an oxidized spirocyclic intermediate using excess N&#8208;halosuccinimide, followed by Na&#8322;S&#8322;O&#8324; reduction. This method ensures complete conversion and simplifies purification. Nine halogenated building blocks were prepared. These methods provide practical access to versatile precursors for natural product synthesis and derivatization, offering potential for diverse synthetic applications including regioselective palladium&#8208;catalyzed couplings.</dc:description>

Homodihalogenation utilized a two-step, one-flask process via a spirocyclic intermediate, yielding dibromo, dichloro, and diiodo analogues, respectively (75-76%, 54-56%, 79-80%). This strategy was extended to synthesize heterodihalogenated bromochloro, bromoiodo, and chloroiodo derivatives from monohalogenated analogues (50-77%). Key to this approach was the formation of an oxidized spirocyclic intermediate using excess N-halosuccinimide, followed by Na&#8322;S&#8322;O&#8324; reduction. This method ensures complete conversion and simplifies purification. Nine halogenated building blocks were prepared. These methods provide practical access to versatile precursors for natural product synthesis and derivatization, offering potential for diverse synthetic applications including regioselective palladium-catalyzed couplings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A mild radical two/three&#8208;component cascade cyclization of 2&#8208;amino aryl ethynes to access difluoroethyl or monofluoromethyl sulfonyl dioxodibenzothiazepines or dibenzazepines with good selectivity/substrate scopes.







Abstract
A photo&#8208;induced two/three&#8208;component radical difluoroethylation or monofluoromethyl sulfonylation of 2&#8208;amino aryl ethynes was smoothly finished, which gave a series of difluoroethyl or monofluoromethyl sulfonyl seven&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles. The two radical systems featured simple/mild reaction conditions, good substrate scopes, and excellent E/Z selectivity. In addition, various radical intermediates were successfully detected by HRMS to explore the reaction process. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and scaled&#8208;up experiments examined the product scaffold and application of this cyclization system.

         <title>Advances in Combined Asymmetric Catalysis of Transition Metal/Phase Transfer Catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advancements in asymmetric metal/phase&#8208;transfer catalyst combined catalysis for rapid and efficient synthesis of complex organic molecules with precise stereochemistry.







Abstract
Phase&#8208;transfer catalysts (PTCs) are chemical agents that facilitate the transfer of molecules or ions between different reaction phases, thereby accelerating heterogeneous reaction processes. Transition metal catalysts are renowned for their versatility in breaking inert chemical bonds and forming new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. Over the past two decades, integrating metal catalysts with phase&#8208;transfer catalysts has emerged as a highly valuable and adaptable strategy in modern organic synthesis. This combined catalytic approach highlights the enhanced synthetic capabilities and demonstrates the benefits of merging these two catalytic systems. This review provides an overview of recent advancements in asymmetric catalysis that utilize the synergy between metal and phase&#8208;transfer catalysts, focusing on their role in the rapid and efficient synthesis of complex organic molecules with precise stereochemistry.

         <title>Practicable Syntheses of Electroluminescent Ionic 2,2&#8242;&#8208;Bifluorenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroluminescent organic molecules have been proffered as the key to unlocking a new generation of light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells. The article describes our development of a practicable library synthesis of a class of electroluminescent materials with a bifluorene core. The approach is applicable to an array of related materials containing a photoluminescent core tethered to heteroaromatic salts by alkyl chains.







Abstract
The development of a practicable library synthesis of ionic 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bifluorenes is described that improves the safety and reduces waste associated with the ubiquitous method of preparing these and related electroluminescent compounds. Additionally, an X&#8208;ray crystal structure that reveals how triflate counterions can provide a second link between the alkylimidazolium subunits and the photoluminescent core is presented.

         <title>Photocatalytic Decarboxylative Fluoroalkylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal decarboxylation&#8211;fluoroalkylation method involving the coupling of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids with &#945;&#8208;CF3 alkyl bromides was developed by the use of dual nickel/photoredox catalysis.

Abstract
A decarboxylative fluoroalkylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acids was developed by the use of a dual nickel/photoredox catalysis system. The fluoroalkyl radicals are generated from &#945;&#8208;CF3 alkyl bromides by nickel&#8208;induced single electron transfer (SET) and are subsequently intercepted by a cinnamic acid to forge the targeted C&#8722;C bonds. A wide variety of substrates bearing a diverse set of functional groups were compatible with the mild reaction conditions (visible light, room temperature, cheap metal, no strong oxidant or reductant), thus affording trifluoromethyl analogues of &#945;&#8208;methylated allylic compounds.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective and environmentally friendly strategy for construction of the pyrrolinone skeleton by a cascade of 1,5&#8208;dienes with CF3SO2Na is developed. This reaction involves radical addition, 5&#8208;endo cyclization and subsequent deprotonation. This protocol employs an inexpensive trifluoromethylation reagent and exhibits excellent regioselectivity, as well as broad substrate scope.







Abstract
A new environmentally friendly and efficient strategy for preparing trifluoromethylated pyrrolidones has been developed. The process involves using visible light to induce radical cyclization of 1,5&#8208;dienes with CF3SO2Na, resulting in excellent regioselectivity. This method uses less expensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;store trifluoromethylation reagents, making it an attractive option. Additionally, the resulting trifluoromethylated pyrrolidones can be easily modified and preliminary mechanistic studies have been presented.

&lt;p&gt;N,O-doped aceanthrylenes have been synthesized for the first time via a selective S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;Ar reaction or Ullmann-coupling of phenols, followed by an intramolecular direct arylation. The reaction has been carefully optimized and permits the selective synthesis of N,O-doped aceanthrylenes in moderate to excellent yields and tolerate various functional groups. The aromatic behavior of the hitherto unknown heterocyclic scaffold has been further analyzed by NICS and NICS2BC calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Silyl Radical&#8208;Participated Silylfunctionalization of Alkenes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkenes and alkynes are readily available basic chemicals. Silyl radical&#8208;participated silylfunctionalization of alkenes or alkynes is an important pathway for synthesizing various functional organosilicon compounds. In this review, we mainly summarize the recent progresses on radical silylfunctionalization of alkenes and alkynes.







Abstract
Alkenes and alkynes are inexpensive and readily available basic chemicals. Silyl radical&#8208;participated silylation of alkenes and alkynes provides a powerful tool for the direct construction of organosilicon compounds. Compared to hydrosilylation reactions, silylfunctionalization reactions are more attractive and advantageous in building diverse organosilicon compounds, which has led to their becoming a research focus in organic synthesis. Herein, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in silyl radical&#8208;participated silylfunctionalization of alkenes and alkynes.

         <title>Efficient Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced &#960;&#8208;Extension of Perylene Tetraesters: An Investigation on Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study discloses an efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced &#960;&#8208;extension of perylene tetraesters, which proceeds by only irradiating blue LED. The synthetic research revealed the relationship between the regioselectivity and electron&#8208;donating/withdrawing effects of the substituents on the aromatic groups. Moreover, theoretical investigation suggested the importance of the bond alteration in the aromatic rings to determine the regioselectivity







Abstract
The present study discloses a highly efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced &#960;&#8208;extension of perylene tetraesters and discussion on the regioselectivity in the photocyclization. We initially found that &#960;&#8208;extension reaction of 3,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl perylene tetraester smoothly proceeded by only irradiating blue LED with a complete regioselectivity. Investigations of the photocyclization with various substrates revealed the relationship between the regioselectivity and electron&#8208;donating/withdrawing effects of the substituents on the aromatic groups. Moreover, theoretical investigation suggested the importance of bond alteration in the aromatic groups: cyclization proceeds preferentially at shorter C&#8722;C bonds with higher double bond characters. The findings will open new possibilities for the practical synthesis of custom&#8208;designed &#960;&#8208;extended perylene materials.

         <title>Computation&#8208;Guided Scope Exploration of a Conjugate Addition/Truce&#8208;Smiles Cascade Reaction for Scaffold Diversification</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explored variations of a conjugate addition/Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement/elimination cascade reaction that proceeds through spiro, bridged, or alternatively fused intermediates. None of these cascade substrates was found to undergo the desired cascade reaction. DFT calculations revealed that the Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement is the rate&#8208;limiting step for these processes. Based on these findings, we designed an alternative substrate that does undergo the cascade reaction, albeit with a different outcome.







Abstract
Based on the successful application of a nitroaryl transfer cascade reaction in the total synthesis of various monoterpene indole alkaloids proceeding via fused bicyclic intermediate, we investigated analogous cascade reactions involving spiro, bridged, and alternatively fused bicyclic intermediates. Unfortunately, none of these was found to afford the desired nitroaryl transfer product. DFT studies of the original cascade process revealed that the Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement is the rate&#8208;determining step. In addition, we found that the subsequent SO2 extrusion is accompanied by retro&#8208;Mannich ring opening, resulting in a stabilized enolate that only recyclizes after activation of the cyclic imine moiety. Computation of the reaction profiles of the proposed alternative cascade reactions showed that the barrier for the Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement is unreasonably high for the bridged and alternatively fused systems, but only moderately higher for the five&#8208;membered spiro system. Reasoning that even more electron&#8208;deficient arenesulfonamides should have a lower barrier for the Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement, we synthesized the corresponding 2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzenesulfonamide precursor and found that it indeed smoothly undergoes the nitroaryl transfer cascade at room temperature. In this case, however, the cascade reaction produces a cyclic imine product, as the intermediate 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenyl&#8208;substituted enolate is insufficiently nucleophilic to undergo the Mannich cyclization.

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;(Pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanyl)acetamides and Impact of the Fluorinated Group on the Lipophilicity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic approach to 2&#8208;(pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanyl)acetamides was developed using an amidation reaction between 2&#8208;(pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanyl)acetic acid and various amines. A 2&#8208;(pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanyl)acetamide could be transformed into two additional SF5&#8208;containing building blocks, a N&#8208;(2&#8208;SF5&#8208;ethyl)amine and an oxadiazoles. Finally, the effect of the SF5 substituent on the lipophilicity of the amide of a model compound was evaluated.







Abstract
The synthesis of 2&#8208;(pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanyl)acetamides is described via an amidation reaction between 2&#8208;(pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanyl)acetic acid, the SF5&#8208;containing building block, and various amines. A total of 27 examples of SF5&#8208;containing amides were synthesized, with isolated yields going from 43&#8201;% to quantitative. We showed that a 2&#8208;(pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanyl)acetamide could be converted to a N&#8208;(2&#8208;SF5&#8208;ethyl)amine and a SF5&#8208;containing oxadiazoles.

         <title>Effect&#8208;Directed Synthesis of a Dithioacetal Tyrosinase Inhibitor</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes the combination of dithioacetal chemistry, thin&#8208;layer chromatography, and in&#8197;situ enzyme activity measurement to generate and identify, on a low milligram scale, a potent yet simple and easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare nanomolar dithioacetal inhibitor of the enzyme tyrosinase.







Abstract
Traditional methods for discovering bioactive compounds can be time&#8208;consuming and resource&#8208;intensive, often requiring extensive synthesis and evaluation. To address these challenges, this study combines TLC&#8208;based assays with dithioacetal mixture&#8208;library preparation, enabling rapid and effective bioactivity screening. Tyrosinase, an enzyme crucial for melanin production and fruit browning, serves as a significant therapeutic target in this context. Despite the substantial potential of sulfur&#8208;containing compounds in medicinal chemistry, the use of dithioacetals in drug discovery remains limited. In this study, two small libraries of dithioacetals, comprising more than 150 compounds, were prepared as mixture&#8208;libraries and screened on TLC by directly measuring tyrosinase activity on the plate surface. This approach facilitated the efficient preparation and identification of a potent, simple, and readily accessible dithioacetal inhibitor of tyrosinase, with the entire process being conducted on a low milligram scale.

         <title>A Squaramide&#8208;Tagged Proline&#8208;Mediated Direct Asymmetric Aldol Addition in the Presence of Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
trans&#8208;4&#8208;squaramide&#8208;tagged proline 2 mediated a direct asymmetric aldol addition in the presence of water. In a departure from results observed with previous catalysts of similar design, 2 proved more efficient to its cis&#8208;counterpart, suggesting factors other than hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions at play. The catalyst also mediated an asymmetric desymmetrization of 4&#8208;alkyl cyclohexanones by the same transformation.







Abstract
A squaramide moiety introduced at the C&#8208;4 position of proline produced an organocatalyst that promoted the direct asymmetric aldol addition in the presence of water. A variety of aldol adducts, majorly from the reaction cyclohexanone with aldehydes, were obtained in yields generally in the range of 53&#8211;99&#8201;%, accompanied by 71&#8211;99&#8201;% ee and 83&#8201;:&#8201;17 to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 diastereomeric ratios. An asymmetric desymmetrization of 4&#8208;alkyl cyclohexanones was also achieved using the transformation.

         <title>Organocatalytic Applications of Sulfonyl Squaramides in Anion&#8208;Recognition Strategies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Appealing, highly acidic N&#8208;sulfonyl squaramides have been designed and synthesized. This versatile architecture provided an excellent catalytic activity in anion&#8208;recognition strategies, as illustrated in the multicomponent dearomatization of 2&#8208;picoline with silyl ketene acetals and Friedel&#8208;Crafts tritylation of N&#8208;methylindole.







Abstract
A modular, 3&#8208;steps protocol for the synthesis of N&#8208;sulfonyl squaramides has been developed. The strategic installation of a tetrahedral, electron&#8208;withdrawing sulfonyl group into the squaramido core allowed the prevention of undesired self&#8208;aggregations, therefore upgrading the solubility in common organic solvents, and moreover, enhancing their H&#8208;bond donor abilities for molecular recognition. These unique features have been efficiently exploited in two different ion&#8208;pairing reactions: (i) the challenging C4&#8208;selective dearomatization of 2&#8208;picoline with silyl ketene acetals and (ii) the tritylation of N&#8208;methylindole. Furthermore, their catalytic activities have been directly compared with other common and well&#8208;established (thio)urea analogues and related H&#8208;bond donors, revealing that highly acidic designs are essential to reach optimal catalytic performances.

         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;catalyzed coupling of 1&#8208;arylbutadienes or styrenes with sulfonyl chlorides to give (E)&#8208;dienyl sulfones and &#946;&#8208;chlorosulfones, respectively has been developed. The dienyl sulfones and &#946;&#8208;chlorosulfones are prepared under base&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions. The developed method displays excellent regioselectivity, mild reaction conditions and compatibility with various functional groups.







Abstract
This work reports a Cu&#8208;catalyzed coupling technique for synthesizing (E)&#8208;dienyl sulfones and &#946;&#8208;chlorosulfones from 1&#8208;arylbutadienes and styrenes, respectively. By employing easily available and inexpensive reagents, this method enables the synthesis of a diverse array of dienyl sulfones and &#946;&#8208;chlorosulfones with excellent functional group tolerance under base&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions. It also proves versatile for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug molecules and the scale&#8208;up reactions. The method showcases notable selectivity, gentle reaction conditions, and compatibility with various functional groups as demonstrated through 66 examples with excellent display of regioselectivity.

         <title>Heteroarylation of Organophosphonium Salts with Indoles in Water: Synthesis of Symmetrical and Unsymmetrical 3,3&#8242;&#8208;Bisindolylmethane Derivatives.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free method for the synthesis of symmetrical and unsymmetrical 3,3&#8242;&#8208;bis(indolyl)methanes has been developed through the direct heteroarylation of indolyl&#8208;containing di(hetero)aryl phosphonium salts with indole derivatives in aqueous media.







Abstract
A method for the synthesis of symmetrical and unsymmetrical 3,3&#8242;&#8208;bis(indolyl)methanes (3,3&#8242;&#8208;BIMs) has been developed through the direct heteroarylation of indolyl&#8208;containing di(hetero)aryl phosphonium salts with indole derivatives in aqueous media. This metal&#8208;free reaction proceeds smoothly under mild conditions, eliminating the need for hazardous solvents and expensive additives/catalysts typically used in conventional synthesis routes, thereby highlighting the synthetic practicality and efficiency of the process. The success of this approach is largely attributed to the role of water as a promoter, facilitating the C&#8722;P bond functionalization of the phosphonium salts. Furthermore, the reaction demonstrates a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and excellent scalability. Moreover, the protocol can also be extended to the synthesis of triindolylmethane compound and diarylmethylated indole.

         <title>Iodoaniline Dependent Formation of N&#8208;Aroylguanidines Versus 2&#8208;Aminoquinazolinones from Palladium(0) Catalysed Aminocarbonylation of N&#8208;Arylguanidines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Arylguanidines upon Pd&#8208;catalysed aminocarbonylation reaction involving aryl iodide, in&#8208;situ generated CO afforded the corresponding N&#8208;aroylguanidines exclusively or a mixture of two types of 2&#8208;aminoquinazolinones or one type of 2&#8208;aminoquinazolinone depending upon the substitution pattern in the substrates. The formation of either type of 2&#8208;aminoquinazolinone involves the C&#8722;N bond cleavage of N&#8208;aroylguanidines, a rare process witnessed in the guanidine chemistry.







Abstract
A family of N,N&#8242;&#8208;diaryl&#8208;N&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)guanidines (B) were prepared in 70&#8201;%&#8211;92&#8201;% yields and subjected to palladium(0) catalyzed aminocarbonylation reactions with aryl iodides using CsOH/CHCl3 mixture as CO surrogate to afford the corresponding N&#8208;aroylguanidines (C) in 70&#8201;%&#8211;93&#8201;% yields. A gram scale synthesis was reported for a representative example. When the aforementioned reaction was carried out with 2&#8208;iodoaniline as an electrophile, either a mixture of two distinct 2&#8208;aminoquinazolinones (D and E) or one of these 2&#8208;aminoquinazolinones are formed. The scope of guanidines and aryl iodides were explored for both of the above&#8208;mentioned reactions. The role of directing group in the substrates upon the successful aminocarbonylation of guanidines, B is outlined. The reactions of a pair of N&#8208;aroylguanidines, C with PhI(OAc)2 afforded 2&#8208;aminobenzimidazoles, T with unanticipated core. Plausible mechanisms of formation of C, D, E and T are outlined.

         <title>A Mechanistic Study of the Oxidation of Substituted Benzyl Alcohols with Trichloroisocyanuric Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism for the oxidation of substituted benzyl alcohols with TCCA was elucidated by kinetic measurements and DFT calculations. We found hydride abstraction by autocatalytic Cl2 as the determining step, while strongly electron withdrawing groups diverted the reaction course to hydrogen abstraction from the respective organic hypochlorite as a special case.







Abstract
A systematic mechanistic study employing rate constant (kobs) kinetics measurements, linear free&#8208;energy relationship, hydrogen kinetic isotope effect and rate law, as well as the Density Functional Theory (DFT) approach (M06&#8208;2x/6&#8208;311G(d,p)) for the oxidation of diverse substituted benzyl alcohols with trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA)/H2O in 50&#8201;% MeCN/CH2Cl2 at 25.0&#8201;&#176;C is present. The kinetic results showed an autocatalytic behavior and a primary kinetic isotope effect (4.22). The linear free&#8208;energy relationship (&#963;, &#961;=&#8722;1.22) indicated a mechanism change for 4&#8208;CF3, 3&#8208;NO2 and 4&#8208;NO2 substituted benzyl alcohols and a fractional rate law (3.25) for benzyl alcohol. The DFT results indicated Cl2, formed in&#8197;situ from TCCA and HCl. Furthermore, calculations support the kinetic results with high agreement through a transition state that performs a hydride abstraction by autocatalytic Cl2 in the induction zone. In the case of substrates bearing strong electron withdrawing groups, the mechanism changes to hydrogen abstraction from the corresponding benzyl hypochlorite as the main pathway.

         <title>Gilding the Lily: Studies on the Effects of Successive Loading of Light Energy&#8208;Storing Molecules with Norbornadiene Units</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small series of chromophores with an increasing number of norbornadiene units was synthesized. Comparison of the reversible photoisomerization reaction to the corresponding quadricyclanes revealed an optimal balance of photochemical properties for the tris&#8208;norbornadiene derivative.







Abstract
The photochromic norbornadiene&#8208;quadricyclane cycle has emerged as a promising basis for molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage. In this context, it has been established that multifunctional photoswitches with several norbornadiene units at one central aromatic core have favorable photochemical properties and storage capacities. Nevertheless, a maximum number of three norbornadiene units has been combined in one molecule, so far. In this work, scope and limits of this approach should be further assessed. Thus, exemplary polyfunctionalized derivatives have been synthesized by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions, and their suitability for MOST applications was investigated. These compounds were converted into the corresponding quadricyclanes by direct UV irradiation (&#955;ex=315&#8197;nm) with moderate quantum yields, whereas the reaction is more efficient upon irradiation with &#955;ex=520&#8197;nm in the presence of photosensitizers. But these molecules showed low stabilities and short half&#8208;lives of 1 to 2&#8197;days. Moreover, the photochemical reaction is hampered by the close vicinity of photoactive units. Therefore, it appears that in such assemblies, a maximum number of three norbornadiene units is the limit to keep the optimal balance of photochemical properties required for MOST applications.

         <title>Ruthenium Catalyzed Formation of Fused Pyridine Derivatives or Substituted Indoles from Hydrazine&#8208;Derived Enamines and Propargyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Annulated pyridines and substituted indoles are important scaffolds in medicinal and agricultural chemistry. These heterocyclic motifs are easily accessible from secondary propargyl alcohols and hydrazine derived enamines by ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions. The bifunctional ruthenium catalyst used is stable to air and moisture and is easily accessible in high yield from commercially available compounds.







Abstract
New ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed transformations of secondary propargyl alcohols with hydrazine&#8208;derived enamines are presented, affording fused pyridines or substituted indoles depending on the hydrazine derivative used. The cascade reactions are catalyzed by an air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable bifunctional ruthenium complex and proceed via redox&#8208;isomerization of the propargyl alcohol, subsequent Michael addition and cyclocondensation. In case of phenylhydrazine a Fischer indole synthesis also takes place, prior to the final release of the products. The produced heterocyclic motifs are important scaffolds in medicinal and agricultural chemistry.

         <title>First Total Synthesis of Deinococcucin A, a Key Glycolipid Found in Cell Membranes of Extremophilic Bacteria.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deinococcucin A is a secondary metabolite isolated from a gut bacteria of carpenter ant, member of extremophilic Deinoccocus family. The structure is a glycolipid containing N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine, linked in &#945; anomeric position to a chiral 2,3&#8208;dihydroxypropanamide moiety. We succeeded a new strategy starting directly from N&#8208;acetylglucosamine and transforming in an efficient manner an allyl group to the corresponding chiral &#945;&#8208;hydroxyamide. Three key steps were used: the oxidation of primary amine to nitrile using TCCA, as well as its hydrolysis to the corresponding amide using palladium (II) catalyzed conditions. The synthesis was completed in only 10 steps with an overall yield of 3%.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deinococcucin A is a secondary metabolite isolated from a gut bacteria of carpenter ant, member of extremophilic Deinoccocus family. The structure is a glycolipid containing N-acetyl glucosamine, linked in &#945; anomeric position to a chiral 2,3-dihydroxypropanamide moiety. We succeeded a new strategy starting directly from N-acetylglucosamine and transforming in an efficient manner an allyl group to the corresponding chiral &#945;-hydroxyamide.

         <title>Merging New and Old Concepts: Tandem Oxidative Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover Ritter Amidation via Multicomponent Photo&#8208; and Electrochemical Processes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen&#8208;containing drug molecules and pharmaceuticals are ubiquitous, rendering the construction of C&#8211;N bonds a crucial target in methodology development. The Ritter reaction is a well&#8208;established method for accessing C&#8211;N bonds by generating amide functionality through the reaction of carbocations and nitriles. Since its discovery back in 1948, the Ritter reaction has progressively advanced towards milder and more sustainable conditions for carbocation generation. In this regard, notable contributions have been made by means of single electron transfer (SET) chemistry. Nowadays, photo&#8208; and electrochemistry are established methods of choice for the generation of reactive radical intermediates and their subsequent oxidation via radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPC) mechanism. We review recent examples of tandem RPC and Ritter&#8208;type protocols, demonstrating how photo&#8208; and electrochemical energies have been effectively harvested to expand the precursor pool for the Ritter reaction and also reimagine the process with novel mechanisms and additives.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Trideuteromethyl Sulfide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The methylthio group plays a significant role in antitumor bioactive molecules, candidate drugs and natural products. Deuteration modification of drugs, which could prolong the half&#8208;life, reduce toxicity, and enhance targeting, has become an important strategy in the development and discovery of innovative drugs. Combining the unique properties of the methylthio group with the deuteration effect, the rapid introduction of trideuteromethylthiol groups into small organic molecules is essential for advancing the research and development of deuterated drugs. With the rapid development of new trideuteromethylthiolation reagents, this review first outlines the indirect introduction of trideuteromethylthiol groups, and then discusses the direct nucleophilic, electrophilic and free radical trideuteromethylthiolation methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Ethynylene&#8208;Bridged Pentacene Trimer and Tetramer Prepared Through Unexpected Oligomerization and Their Subsequent Thermal Conversions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethynylene&#8208;bridged acenes, which are &#960;&#8208;conjugated triple bond&#8208;containing systems, have attracted increasing interest as promising organic semiconductor materials due to their delocalized&#160;&#960;&#8208;electrons. In this study, ethynylene&#8208;bridged pentacene precursor oligomers were not only synthesized through multiple&#8208;organic reactions but also were unexpectedly obtained in one&#8208;pot by using a conventional reaction with lithium silylacetylide and quinone. In the case of one&#8208;pot synthesis, the formation of oligomers, including pentamer, was evidently confirmed by matrix&#8208;assisted&#8208;laser&#8208;desorption/ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis visualized the ethynylene&#8208;bridged structure of the dimer which was one of the major products in the one&#8208;pot reaction. It was found that the reaction time for the lithiation was the key factor in controlling oligomer formation. Finally, the thermal conversion from pentacene precursors to the corresponding pentacene oligomers was achieved via retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. These results would open an access to synthesize a wide range of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Direct N&#8211;C(sp2) Nitrone Synthesis from Oxime</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrones are pivotal in organic chemistry, especially for the synthesis of natural and biologically active compounds via 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions and Kinugasa reactions. Although numerous methods have been reported for the synthesis of nitrones with an sp3 carbon connected to a nitrogen atom, the development of nitrones with an sp2 carbon linkage, including N&#8208;vinyl, N&#8208;aryl, and N&#8208;alkoxycarbonyl nitrones, remains relatively underexplored. This review summarizes the current research trends and methodologies for the direct synthesis of nitrones, in which an sp2 carbon is directly bonded to a nitrogen atom, beginning with oximes.</dc:description>
