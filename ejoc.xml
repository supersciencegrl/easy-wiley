Various aryl, heteroaryl, and alkyl aldehydes are utilized as sources of the alkyl substituents; reactions with electron&#8208;rich aldehydes afford the corresponding alkylpyrazines in good yields. The overall reaction sequence was clarified by DFT calculations; in this reaction, activation of the N &#8208;trimethylsilyl moiety by fluoride, forming the electron&#8208;rich silicate intermediate Int&#8208;1 , is the key step for the subsequent C&#8208;C bond formation with aldehydes, and the following 1,3&#8208;proton transfer from Int&#8208;3 to Int&#8208;4 is the rate&#8208;determining step. In addition, treatment of N,N&#8217; &#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyrazines ( 1a ) with electron&#8208;deficient alkyl halides under fluoride&#8208;free conditions affords the corresponding alkylated pyrazines, in which electron&#8208;transfer between the two substrates is the initial step for further C&#8208;C bond formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Multicomponent Functionalization of the Octreotide Peptide Macrocyclic Scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New octreotide analogs were prepared by replacing the disulfide bond with a functionalized tertiary lactam bridge. The on&#8208;resin approach includes an Ugi multicomponent macrocyclization that enables the simultaneous ring closure and incorporation of lipids, fluorophores and functional groups suitable for the subsequent conjugation to cytotoxic moieties.







Abstract
The replacement of the disulfide bridge by other types of side chain linkages has been a continuous endeavor in the development of cyclic peptide drugs with improved metabolic stability. Octreotide is a potent and selective somatostatin analog that has been used as an anticancer agent, in radiolabeled conjugates for the localization of tumors and as targeting moiety in peptide&#8208;drug conjugates. Here, we describe an on&#8208;resin methodology based on a multicomponent macrocyclization that enables the substitution of the disulfide bond by a tertiary lactam bridge functionalized with a variety of exocyclic moieties, including lipids, fluorophores, and charged groups. Conformational analysis in comparison with octreotide provides key information on the type of functionalization permitting the conformational mimicry of the bioactive peptide.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intermolecular hydroaminoalkylation reactions of 1,1&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allenes as well as methylenecyclopropanes with secondary amines can be achieved in the presence of a 2,6&#8208;bis(phenylamino)pyridinato titanium catalyst at 140 &#176;C within 2&#8208;8 h. Corresponding reactions of allenes with N &#8208;benzylanilines deliver branched allylamine products in very good yields (up to 83%) and with branched&#8208;linear&#8208;ratios between 75:25 and 95:5. In contrast, bicyclic methylenecyclopropanes undergo hydroaminoalkylation with N &#8208;benzylanilines or N &#8208;alkylbenzylamines to give linear products in good to excellent yields (up to 98%) with perfect regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.

         <title>C&#8722;H Activation Based Functionalization of Furfural Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review summarizes the reported methods of direct C&#8722;H functionalization of furfurals without prior modification of the redox state of the aldehyde function. The aim is to illustrate the different approaches implemented for the functionalization of the C&#8722;H positions of the furan ring as well as of the aldehyde functional group.







Abstract
Furfural and related compounds are building blocks of industrial interest, obtained from raw biomass. Their use as precursors of basic and fine chemicals has gained increasing attention as a green alternative to petroleum&#8208;derived compounds. Several works have reported the functionalization of furfurals to obtain a wider range of chemicals, opening up new synthetic possibilities and applications, ranging from biofuels to pharmaceuticals. Among these works, processes based on C&#8722;H activation are the most attractive ones for their atom economy and the possibility to use non&#8208;activated substrates. This minireview summarizes the reported methods of direct C&#8722;H functionalization of furfurals without prior modification of the redox state of the aldehyde function. In particular, the transition metal catalyzed functionalization of each bond of the heteroaromatic nucleus of these molecules is systematically discussed, as well as examples of C&#8722;H transformations of the aldehyde function.

         <title>Divergent Annulation of Spiro[indoline&#8208;pyran] and Fused (Epoxyetheno)indeno&#8208;Furan from 1,2&#8208;Diketone and 1&#8208;Cyanoketone</title>

         <dc:description>
A operationally simple one&#8208;step method developed for the spiro[indoline&#8208;pyran] and fused (epoxyetheno)indeno[1,2&#8208;b]furan derivatives from 1&#8208;cyanoketones and cyclic 1,2&#8208;diketon.







Abstract
A simple and efficient method for the construction of spiro[indoline&#8208;pyran] and fused (epoxyetheno)indeno[1,2&#8208;b]furan compounds from 1&#8208;cyanoketones and 1,2&#8208;diketone has been developed. The synthesis proceeded via the Knoevenagel and Michael adduct through intramolecular/Paal&#8208;Knorr cyclization under similar reaction condition. The less commonly used 1&#8208;cyanoketones and active carbonyl compounds served as the indole containing pyran and bicyclic furan source for the preparation of a new series of heterocyclic compounds. This heterocyclic structure allows one and more than one tetra&#8208;substituted carbon center and sequential hexa&#8208; and penta&#8208;cyclic core under very mild conditions and shows excellent chemo and regioselectivity. In addition, the synthesis of spiro[indoline&#8208;pyran] and (epoxyetheno)indeno[1,2&#8208;b]furan was demonstrated in a gram scale.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stereoselective Synthesis of 6,7&#8208;Dideoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranuronates</title>

Synthesis of the rare and challenging &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranuronate configuration can be succeeded using a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective one&#8208;pot process from a 2&#8208;O&#8208;activated &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;galacto&#8208;octopyranuronate ester. The &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranosyl ring was revealed to adopt predominantly a 4C1 chair conformation by NMR.







Abstract
6&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosides are challenging glycosides to synthesize due to their unusual 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;heptose backbone, rare ido&#8208;configuration and most importantly, the &#946;&#8208;1,2&#8208;cis anomeric linkage. They are found in nature, such as being part of the repeating disaccharide of C. jejuni HS:4 capsular polysaccharides (CPs). Interestingly, the bacterial CPs is found to be partially modified with an O&#8208;methyl phosphoramidate (MeOPN) functionality at the O&#8208;2 or O&#8208;7 position of the 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosides. In this work, we report the first synthesis of three analogous of &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranosides (1&#8211;3) that contain a 6,7&#8208;dideoxy&#8208;functionality and either a terminal methyl ester or carboxylic acid or amide. Since carboxylic acids have been reported as bioisosteres of phosphate group, compound 1&#8211;3 can be regarded as carbon&#8208;based bioisosteres of 6&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranoside containing the MeOPN group without a chiral center. Compounds (1&#8211;3) were efficiently synthesized from a O&#8208;2 activated &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;galacto&#8208;octopyranuronate (19) that was efficiently converted to the desired &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;ido&#8208;octopyranuronate configuration using an elegant one&#8208;pot process.

         <title>Reactions of Enaminones with p&#8208;Quinone Methides: Access to 4H&#8208;Chromene and 4H&#8208;Chromen&#8208;4&#8208;one Derivatives</title>

A common platform to access a privileged class of oxygen&#8208;containing heterocycles such as 4H&#8208;chromenes and 4H&#8208;chromen&#8208;4&#8208;ones through a Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;mediated one&#8208;pot reaction between enaminones and p&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) has been developed. By suitably modifying the p&#8208;QMs and/or enaminones, one can selectively access either 4H&#8208;chromenes or 4H&#8208;chromen&#8208;4&#8208;ones in moderate to excellent yields under acidic conditions.







Abstract
A one&#8208;pot approach for the synthesis of oxygen&#8208;containing heterocycles such as 4H&#8208;chromenes and 4H&#8208;chromen&#8208;4&#8208;ones has been established through the reaction of enaminones with p&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs). This transformation basically involves an acid&#8208;catalyzed 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition of enaminones to p&#8208;QMs followed by annulation. In the case of reaction between 2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl&#8208;substituted p&#8208;quinone methides and N,N&#8208;dimethyl enaminones, 4H&#8208;chromene derivatives were obtained in moderate to excellent yields. Similarly, the reaction between simple p&#8208;quinone methides and 2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl&#8208;substituted N,N&#8208;dimethyl enaminones led to 4H&#8208;chromen&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives in good yields.

An expedient method for the preparation of unsymmetrical tri(hetero)arylmethanes from para&#8208;quinone methides and derivatives of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline under copper catalysis is described.







Abstract
A C(5)&#8722;H remote functionalization of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline derivatives with para&#8208;quinone methides, affording direct access to unsymmetrical tri(hetero)arylmethanes in 69&#8211;96&#8201;% yield is described. This method provides diverse tri(hetero)arylmethanes with a broad scope and in a regioselective manner. The transformation works well with electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient substrates.

Abstract
A simple and efficient synthetic method to C&#8722;S bonds was established based on the Chan&#8211;Lam reaction. A series of O/N&#8208;alkyl S&#8208;phenyl phenylcarbamothioates were obtained in good yields by using odorless O/N&#8208;alkyl phenylthiocarbamates as sulfur sources and commercially available phenylboronic acids as substrates catalyzed by Cu(OAc)2. This methodology features simple performance, odorless sulfur source, easily available starting material, good functional group tolerance, and high chemo&#8208;selectivity to construct C&#8722;S bonds, thereby providing an alternative way to the synthesis of potentially bioactive compounds.

Macrocyclic catalysts having a phenol&#8208;acetylene&#8208;phenol triad were developed. The rigid macrocyclic framework enabled the triads to form efficient hydrogen&#8208;bonds with carbonyl groups of substrates. The catalysts accelerated Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, and the catalytic abilities were higher than that of an acyclic counterpart.







Abstract
Macrocyclic catalysts having a phenol&#8208;acetylene&#8208;phenol triad were developed as a hydrogen&#8208;bond donor catalyst. The rigid macrocyclic framework suppressed intramolecular hydrogen bonds between neighboring phenolic hydroxy groups. The preorganized phenol&#8208;acetylene&#8208;phenol moiety formed efficient intermolecular hydrogen bonds with carbonyl groups of substrates. The hydrogen&#8208;bond donor catalysts accelerated the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of methyl vinyl ketone with cyclopentadiene. The catalytic ability was higher than that of an acyclic counterpart.

         <title>Pro&#8208;Pro Dipeptide&#8208;Thiourea Organocatalyst in the Mannich Reaction between &#945;&#8208;Imino Esters and Pyruvates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 32, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional peptide&#8208;thiourea organocatalysts enantioselectively catalyze Mannich reaction between tosyl&#8208;protected glyoxylate imine and pyruvate esters. N&#8208;terminal proline moiety is responsible for the stereoinduction of this reaction. DFT calculations, NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry confirm bifunctional nature of the catalyst and simultaneous activation of both substrates.







Abstract
Enantioselective catalytic formation of polyfunctional molecules, such as non&#8208;natural amino acids, is important for the efficient production of many chiral compounds. To this end, we present here the synthesis and evaluation of the catalytic activity of bifunctional peptide&#8211;thiourea organocatalysts. These hybrid organocatalysts consist of Pro&#8208;Pro dipeptide and thiourea moiety connected via a 1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane unit. These catalysts promoted challenging Mannich reaction between &#945;&#8208;imino esters and pyruvates, providing orthogonally protected oxo&#8208;glutamate derivatives. The N&#8208;tosyl&#8208;protected imino ester, as the most active imine, was required to compensate for the poor reactivity of pyruvates. DFT calculations, NMR, and CD spectroscopy help elucidate the mode of action of these catalysts. Configuration of the dipeptide Pro&#8208;Pro moiety is responsible for the sense of the stereoinduction of the Mannich reaction.

         <title>Trifluoromethylated Indolopyranones through Regioselective Annulation of Indole Carboxylic Acids with Unsymmetric Internal Trifluoromethylated Alkynes</title>

Three in one: three valid pharmacophores (indole, pyranone and trifluoromethyl) were successfully combined into one molecule by rhodium&#8208;catalyzed regioselective annulation of indole carboxylic acids with unsymmetric internal trifluoromethylated alkynes.







Abstract
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cross coupling/annulation of indole carboxylic acids with unsymmetric internal trifluoromethylated alkynes was accomplished, which enabled direct access to diverse trifluoromethylated indolopyranones, by combining indole, pyranone and trifluoromethyl, three valid pharmacophores, into one molecule. Diverse indole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acids and indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acids were proved to be suitable reaction partners. Excellent regioselectivity was dominated by electron difference of unsymmetric alkynes. Moderate to good yields, high efficiency and atom economy were achieved for a broad substrate scope with high functional group tolerance.

         <title>N&#8208;Alkylation of &#945;&#8208;Amino Esters and Amides through Hydrogen Borrowing</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 32, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the iridium catalysed direct alkylation of amino esters and amides using alcohols, which can utilise both the free base and HCl salts of the amine, was developed. This reaction proceeds through a borrowing hydrogen borrowing mechanism.







Abstract
The iridium catalysed N&#8208;alkylation of &#945;&#8208;amino esters and amides using alcohols through hydrogen borrowing has been developed. The protocol can be applied to both the free base and hydrochloride salts of the amines and produces water as the only by&#8208;product. This transformation can provide easy access to chiral N&#8208;alkyl amines from readily available starting materials in a simple one step reaction.

         <title>Exporting Homogeneous Transition Metal Catalysts to Biological Habitats</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 32, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed reactions are being increasingly used in biological contexts and even in living cells and organisms. Most of the processes so far developed rely on the ability of metal complexes to bind and activate unsaturated systems in a bioorthogonal way. The reactions are often tracked by fluorescence microscopy, by using reaction probes that emit light only after the reaction.







Abstract
The possibility of performing designed transition&#8208;metal catalyzed reactions in biological and living contexts can open unprecedented opportunities to interrogate and interfere with biology. However, the task is far from obvious, in part because of the presumed incompatibly between organometallic chemistry and complex aqueous environments. Nonetheless, in the past decade there has been a steady progress in this research area, and several transition&#8208;metal (TM)&#8208;catalyzed bioorthogonal and biocompatible reactions have been developed. These reactions encompass a wide range of mechanistic profiles, which are very different from those used by natural metalloenzymes. Herein we present a summary of the latest progress in the field of TM&#8208;catalyzed bioorthogonal reactions, with a special focus on those triggered by activation of multiple carbon&#8208;carbon bonds.

These reactions encompass a wide range of mechanistic profiles, which are very different from those used by natural metalloenzymes. Herein we present a summary of the latest progress in the field of TM-catalyzed bioorthogonal reactions, with a special focus on those triggered by activation of multiple carbon-carbon bonds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Open&#8208;Cage Fullerenes Containing a H&#8208;Bond between the Encapsulated Water Molecule and the Amide Moiety on the Rim of the Orifice</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 32, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantitative water encapsulation is reached during the formation process of the open&#8208;cage fullerene with a 17&#8208;member orifice which is completely blocked by the amide group directly above the orifice. The amide oxygen forms a H&#8208;bond with the trapped water. The bond length (O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;O) is 2.859&#8197;&#197; as shown by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, and the H&#8208;bond energy is about &#8722;3.83&#8197;kcal/mol by theoretical calculation.







Abstract
Further hydrolysis of an open&#8208;cage fullerene derivative with an epoxy moiety on the rim of the orifice led to the formation of a new open&#8208;cage fullerene with a 17&#8208;membered orifice and an amide group directly above the orifice. The water encapsulation ratio in the new open&#8208;cage compound reached 100&#8201;% as a result of heating with water at 80&#8201;&#176;C. The amide group above the orifice completely blocks the opening and forms H&#8208;bond with the trapped water molecule. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structure shows that the bond length between the trapped water oxygen and the amide oxygen is 2.859&#8197;&#197;. The H&#8208;bond energy is about &#8722;3.83&#8197;kcal/mol as shown by theoretical calculation.

         <dc:description>The regioselective hydroboration/hydrolysis of epoxides with pinacolborane to secondary alcohols catalyzed by NaOH/BEt3 was achieved. Glycidyl oxide, styrene oxide and adamantane epoxide underwent facile hydroboration/deprotection to provide secondary alcohols with exclusive selectivity in good to excellent yields. Moreover, the stereochemistry of epoxides could also be well retained and delivered the corresponding secondary alcohols with high optical activity under alkaline catalytic system. Significantly, in this reaction, diverse functional groups can be compatible, including hydrogenation&#8208;sensitive groups, such as carbon&#8208;carbon double bond and halogen.</dc:description>

A selective deconstructive strategy of indolo[2,3&#8208;a]quinolizines to hexahydroindolizin&#8208;3&#8208;ones under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions was developed and applied to the total synthesis of both enantiomers of cuscutamine. Additionally, controversy of the absolute configuration of the natural products was clarified.







Abstract
The general approach for accessing to a tetracyclic hexahydro&#8208;3H&#8208;indolizino[8,7&#8208;b]indol&#8208;3&#8208;one alkaloids is that what involves the construction of the &#947;&#8208;lactam ring from a tricyclic precursor. Here in this report, we disclose a new synthetic strategy that permits the direct deconstruction of the tetracyclic indolo[2,3&#8208;a]quinolizine motif into the tetracyclic hexahydroindolizin&#8208;3&#8208;one scaffold of the naturally occurring (+)&#8208;cuscutamine without the use of either transition or precious metals. Additionally, the current total synthesis of both enantiomers provides structural clarification of the natural occurring alkaloid.

Optical pure &#945;, &#947;&#8208;disubstituted &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones were obtained with excellent results through double asymmetric hydrogenation of (E)&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;oxo&#8208;2&#8208;alkenoic acids utilizing Rh/JosiPhos catalytic system.







Abstract
Optical pure &#945;, &#947;&#8208;disubstituted &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones moieties are versatile building blocks for the synthesis of many drugs and natural products. Herein we report a straightforward and efficient approach to afford a series of chiral &#945;, &#947;&#8208;disubstituted &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones with excellent results (up to 98&#8201;% yield, up to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 d.r., and up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee) through the double asymmetric hydrogenation of the (E)&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;oxo&#8208;2&#8208;alkenoic acids utilizing the rhodium/JosiPhos catalytic system.

Abstract
A convenient and versatile synthesis of &#945;&#8208;halo&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluoroketones, including &#945;&#8208;iodo&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluoroketones, &#945;&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluoroketones and &#945;&#8208;chloro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluoroketones by using Wu&#8211;Colby's protocol involving the release of trifluoroacetate was reported. The ketones&#8217; application as monofluoroalkyl building blocks was explored through coupling and radical reactions. The results indicated that &#945;&#8208;iodo&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluoroketones are the most popular reagents to construct diverse valuable single&#8208;fluorinated molecules.

         <title>The Emerging Promise with O/C&#8208;Glycosides of Important Dietary Phenolic Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The health benefits of non&#8208;nutritive polyphenolic compounds present in plant sources and often constituting part of dietary intake, such as fruits, vegetables, cereals, and beverages (coffee/tea) have been well supported by several epidemiological studies, spanning over last few decades. Despite conflicting claims, the advancement beyond traditional understanding that health benefits originate from the antioxidant properties of these polyphenolics by the way of removing reactive oxygen species (ROS), has spurred renewed interest in the recent times. The varied pharmacological properties associated with these polyphenolics and their O&#8208;glycosides from nature have inspired their use as valuable leads for further development and application as therapeutics. This perspective presents a brief overview of important dietary phenolics and their biological properties severing as a lead for ongoing research in their applications for health benefits.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Studies on the Initially Proposed Structure of Protoaculeine B: Discovery of Neuronally Active Heterotricyclic Amino Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report our results in detail on the synthetic studies of the originally proposed structure of protoaculeine B, isolated from a marine sponge. Starting from tryptophan, two candidates of the suitably protected heterotricyclic subunits were stereoselectively synthesized over 8 and 16 steps, respectively. Furthermore, two diastereomeric heterotricyclic amino acids, finally synthesized, were found to be neuroactive: the (9  S  *,11  S  *)&#8208;isomer with natural&#8208;type configuration was hyperactive, whereas diastereomeric (9  S  *,11  R  *)&#8208;isomer was hypoactive upon mice intracerebroventricular injection.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescent Probe for the Monitoring of Plasma Membrane Hydration</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Subcellular microenvironment plays a crucial role in maintaining cell homeostasis being hydration an essential parameter to monitor the variations of lipid organization in biological membranes. Fluorescent microenvironment&#8208;sensitive probes are stimuli&#8208;responsive molecules able to change their fluorescence profile according to the microenvironment properties (polarity, hydration, microviscosity and tension). Here we present an organic fluorescent probe,  NPM&#8208;1  , as a new microenvironment dye with selective plasma membrane localization in live cells. Using high&#8208;resolution confocal microscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy, we explored the hydration and polarity variations during the formation of apoptotic bodies in real time. To have a clear understanding of the cell microenvironment variations, an analogue polarity probe able to localize the cytosol and nucleoli was also synthetized,  CellPol&#8208;1  . Then, we were able to monitor the subcellular hydration variations during the apoptotic body dynamics.</dc:description>

         <title>Calix[n]arenes in Action: Recent Applications in Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents an overview of the last ten years of advances in organic synthesis using calixarenes as organocatalysts. Calixarenes display a three&#8208;dimensional structure of a macrocycle that can be chemically modified to better act as a catalyst. They also are tolerant to aqueous or solvent&#8208;free systems, being recyclable and easy to separate from the reaction medium.







Abstract
The use of calix[n]arenes as organocatalysts has increasingly been considered a prime focus due to their adjustable three&#8208;dimensional molecular structure, easy synthesis, and versatile structural modification at the upper and lower edges. For instance, these macromolecules have been described as efficient catalysts for asymmetric aldol reactions, asymmetric Michael addition, esterification and transesterification, dehydration, nucleophilic aromatic substitution, and multicomponent reactions. Furthermore, calix[n]arenes also tolerate aqueous or solvent&#8208;free reaction systems and can be supported on solid and/or magnetic particles, showing cost, time and energy savings, easier experimental procedures, and chemical waste reduction.

         <title>Separation of the Thorpe&#8722;Ingold and Reactive Rotamer Effect by Using the Formation of Bicyclic Aziridinium Ions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A classic, angle dependent Thorpe&#8208;Ingold effect in the formation of bicyclic aziridinium ions is presented. Kinetic studies, backed up by SC&#8208;XRD and DFT calculations, reveal a linear correlation of the internal angle &#946; with the rate constant k1. Increased angles result in decreased rate constants and vice versa. The cyclic structure of the examined 3&#8208;chloropiperidines thereby excludes contribution of the reactive rotamer effect towards this cyclization.







Abstract
The geminal dialkyl effect is widely used in organic synthesis to promote cyclization reactions, although the exact origin of its rate enhancement remains unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate the applicability of this effect for the intramolecular formation of bicyclic aziridinium ions and assign it to angle contractions provided by introduction of sterically demanding substituents. Due to the cyclic structure of the examined 3&#8208;chloropiperidines the acceleration of this ring closure cannot be explained by an increased population of reactive gauche rotamers and therefore agrees with the original Thorpe&#8208;Ingold theory. Furthermore, introduction of strained aliphatic rings resulted in internal angle expansions and were accompanied by a preliminary decrease of rate constants for the investigated aziridinium ion formation. These results lead to a linear correlation between internal angle and relative reaction rate, supported by computational and X&#8208;ray crystallographic structural data.

         <title>Supramolecular Catalysts for Organic Synthesis: Preparation and Applications of Cyclodextrins and Calixarenes in C&#8208;C Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactions that promote the formation of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds are of great importance in organic synthesis, since those transform available, relatively inexpensive, and small organic molecules into the more complex ones. One of the main protocols used for these transformations are cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and due to their versatility and applications, several efforts have been devoted recently into developing catalysts for such reactions. Supramolecular chemistry has become a major player in this field and encompasses approaches that range from the synthesis of intricate complex architectures that may mimic enzymes, the slight structural modification of commercially available scaffolds, or even repurposing highly available materials such as agarose. In this review we discuss the development of supramolecular catalysts for cross&#8208;coupling reactions, focusing mostly on the Suzuki, Heck and Sonogashira reactions promoted by such assemblies.</dc:description>

One of the main protocols used for these transformations are cross-coupling reactions, and due to their versatility and applications, several efforts have been devoted recently into developing catalysts for such reactions. Supramolecular chemistry has become a major player in this field and encompasses approaches that range from the synthesis of intricate complex architectures that may mimic enzymes, the slight structural modification of commercially available scaffolds, or even repurposing highly available materials such as agarose. In this review we discuss the development of supramolecular catalysts for cross-coupling reactions, focusing mostly on the Suzuki, Heck and Sonogashira reactions promoted by such assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereospecific Access to &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;Glycosylamine Derivatives by a Metal Free O&#8208;to&#8208;N [3,3]&#8208;Sigmatropic Rearrangement</title>

         <dc:description>
Glycals substituted at C&#8208;3 with a carbamate group undergo, upon dehydration, a prompt allyl cyanate to isocyanate rearrangement to the isomeric N&#8208;glycosyl isocyanates, which give N&#8208;glycosyl carbamates and ureas by one&#8208;pot addition of alcohols or amines. The rearrangement occurs with complete stereoselectivity via a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic mechanism, affording &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;linked amines depending on the configuration at C&#8208;3 of the carbohydrate.







Abstract
Glycosylamine derivatives are biologically relevant compounds widespread in Nature, but the synthesis of this motif has been little addressed and its access with control of configuration at the anomeric carbon is challenging. Glycals substituted at C&#8208;3 with a carbamate group undergo, upon dehydration, a prompt allyl cyanate to isocyanate rearrangement to the isomeric N&#8208;glycosyl isocyanates, which can be conveniently trapped by one&#8208;pot nucleophilic addition with alcohols or amines to afford N&#8208;glycosyl carbamates and ureas, respectively. The rearrangement follows a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic pericyclic mechanism as illustrated by the stereospecificity of the reaction, with nitrogen being delivered at the anomeric position to the same face from which the oxygen at C&#8208;3 has departed. Thus, glucal and galactal give &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;glycosides exclusively while allal furnishes &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;glycosides. cis&#8208;Dihydroxylation of the synthesized unsaturated N&#8208;glycosides afford different 1&#8208;aminosugars with good selectivity.

         <title>Catechol&#8208;Functionalized Carbon Nanotubes as Support for Pd Nanoparticles: a Recyclable System for the Heck Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiwalled carbon nanotubes were highly functionalized with catechol moieties by means of a simple procedure involving the in&#8208;situ generation of the diazonium salt arising from the reaction between 4&#8208;aminocatechol and isoamyl nitrite. The resulting material was used to immobilize Pd nanoparticles obtaining an active and recyclable catalyst for the Heck reaction between methyl acrylate/styrene and aryl iodides.







Abstract
Carbon nanotubes have been covalently functionalized with catechol moieties through the formation of the corresponding aryl radicals obtained by reacting 4&#8208;aminocatechol with isoamyl nitrite. The functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes have been in turn used to immobilize Pd(II) ions on its surface forming catechol&#8208;Pd complexes, which were reduced to Pd nanoparticles (NPs). The so&#8208;obtained hybrid material has been characterized by means of thermogravimetric analysis coupled with differential scanning calorimetry (TGA&#8208;DSC), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This latter technique allowed to estimate the nanoparticle size (5.7&#177;2.8&#8197;nm) whereas a palladium loading of 20.3&#8197;wt&#8201;% has been found by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP&#8208;OES). The carbon nanotube&#8208;catechol&#8208;Pd hybrid was used as catalyst in two C&#8722;C coupling reactions, namely Suzuki and Heck reactions, resulting recyclable for at least 9 times in the latter process. During the reuse Pd nanoparticles increase their dimension to 19.3&#177;11.7&#8197;nm.

This strategy includes merits of high site&#8208;selectivity, step economy, and broad substrates scope. Synthetic utility was demonstrated by the one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step synthesis of N&#8208;alkyl triazoles compounds via a click chemistry. To evaluate the antiproliferative activity of these compounds, A549s (human lung adenocarcinoma cells) and HUVECs, as a model of toxicity, were used in MTT assay. The outcomes disclosed for 6&#8208;CO2Me and a N&#8208;alkyl triazole derivatives were of potent antiproliferative effect against A549s (IC50 = 4.7 and 14.9 &#956;M, respectively) with slight cytotoxicity in HUVECs.

         <title>Cobalt Porphyrin&#8208;Catalysed Synthesis of Azobenzenes by Dehydrogenative Coupling of Anilines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The demand for azobenzenes has exponentially grown due to their wide range of applications in textile, medical, and dye industries. Here we report a procedure to synthesise azobenzenes by the dehydrogenative coupling of anilines in the presence of CoII(TPP) (TPP = dianion of tetraphenyl porphyrin) catalyst and 4&#8209;nitrophenyl azide oxidant species. Differently substituted azobenzenes were obtained in yields up to 72% together with 4&#8209;nitrophenyl amine, which is the stoichiometric by&#8208;product of the process. The procedure displayed a good sustainability due to the almost quantitative recovery of pure 4&#8209;nitrophenyl amine that can be transformed again into the desired azide to pave the way for an efficient circular process. Experimental data supported the occurrence of a radical mechanism mediated by putative nitrene radical cobalt intermediate.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Unprotected  6,7&#8208;benzotropolone and bromine were known to undergo an electrophilic substitution delivering the 7&#8208;bromo derivative; it was carried on as its methyl ether.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights of Lewis Acid&#8208;Controlled Torquoselective Nazarov Cyclization of Activated Dienones Bearing a Chiral Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work provides a switchable strategy to access,  via  a Nazarov cyclization, two diastereomeric disubstituted 3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrahydrocyclopenta[  b  ]pyran&#8208;7(2H)&#8208;ones from an activated dienone bearing a chiral sulfoxide. The switch in the torquoselectivity is controlled by the nature of the Lewis acid used as promoter. From the four possible stereoisomers, only the two  trans  were observed. The Lewis acids employed were achiral, the diastereoselectivities being dictated by the sulfinyl auxiliary. Density functional theory investigations shed light on the reaction mechanism. The torquoselectivities were very closely reproduced and their inversion could be linked back to a change in the binding mode of the substrate</dc:description>

         <title>Polyazaacene and Cyclazaacene Precursors Synthesized by Dehydration Condensation from a Versatile Bis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diketone Unit Having an Anthracene Skeleton</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, 8,11&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8201;:&#8201;8,11&#8208;diethanopentacene&#8208;2,3,9,10(1H,4H)&#8208;tetraone was used as a versatile compound for synthesizing polyazaacene and cyclazaacene precursors. This modular strategy provides a novel pathway for generating polyazaacene precursors of varying lengths and cyclazaacene precursors of various sizes for being assessed by the powerful on&#8208;surface chemistry.







Abstract
Azaacenes are acene analogs containing nitrogen atoms in their carbon&#8208;based molecular skeletons and are attracting significant attention because of their potential application in organic electronics. However, polyazaacenes have solubility and stability issues. In this study, we report a modular approach employing 8,11&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8201;:&#8201;8,11&#8208;diethanopentacene&#8208;2,3,9,10(1H,4H)&#8208;tetraone (1) as a key compound for &#960;&#8208;extension with commercially available materials to synthesize a series of polytetraazaacene thermal precursors. Exploiting this strategy, tetraazaheptacene, tetraazanonacene, and tetraazaundecacene precursors were successfully synthesized. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that the tetraazanonacene precursor can be converted to its corresponding tetraazanonacene in a nitrogen atmosphere. To extend the applicability of this method, compound 1 was also used to synthesize the cyclazaacene precursor at 0.8&#8201;% yield. This approach provides a new perspective for exploring the synthesis of polyazaacene and cyclazaacene precursors by using a crucial key compound via dehydration condensation reactions.

         <title>Selective Electrochemical Dibromination of Terpenes and Naturally Derived Olefins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple electrochemical protocol is established for the selective alkene dibromination of naturally derived olefins, such as terpenes. The use of hazardous Br  2  or its analogues have been elegantly avoided by employing readily available, inexpensive and harmless sodium bromide with a dual role as reagent and supporting electrolyte in combination with sustainable carbon&#8208;based electrodes. This electrochemical protocol provides the desired products with good to excellent yields up to 82% with 10 examples. Scalability has been proved by a 5&#8208;fold scale&#8208;up. Notably, higher yields and selectivity were achieved in comparison to conventional bromination via DMSO/HBr system and the dibrominated compound was eligible for further functionalization, such as cyanation according to the Kolbe nitrile synthesis protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Oxazole&#8211;Tetrahydropyran Hybrids and Study on Their Antiproliferative Activity Against Human Tumour Cells</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a previously prepared lead compound, a new series of hybrid compounds was prepared and tested against six human tumour cell lines. These new triazole linked tetrahydropyran&#8211;oxazole hybrids were prepared evaluating the impact of the LogP for the proposed modifications. The compounds exhibited good antiproliferative results when compared with standards cisplatin and 5&#8208;fluorouracil.







Abstract
A series of triazole linked tetrahydropyran&#8211;oxazole hybrids was synthesized based on a previously reported lead compound with selective antiproliferative activity against human tumour cell lines. The series was prepared to evaluate the impact of LogP and different modifications in the activity, and the new compounds were assayed against A549, HBL&#8208;100, HeLa, SW1573, T&#8208;47D, and WiDr cell lines. Also, the potentiality to be P&#8208;gp substrate was tested. The compounds exhibited good antiproliferative results when compared with the standards cisplatin and 5&#8208;fluorouracil. In silico studies to evaluate pharmacokinetic properties using pkCSM software were also carried out.

     alt="Synthesis of Oxazole&#8211;Tetrahydropyran Hybrids and Study on Their Antiproliferative Activity Against Human Tumour Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on a previously prepared lead compound, a new series of hybrid compounds was prepared and tested against six human tumour cell lines. These new triazole linked tetrahydropyran&#8211;oxazole hybrids were prepared evaluating the impact of the LogP for the proposed modifications. The compounds exhibited good antiproliferative results when compared with standards cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of triazole linked tetrahydropyran&#8211;oxazole hybrids was synthesized based on a previously reported lead compound with selective antiproliferative activity against human tumour cell lines. The series was prepared to evaluate the impact of LogP and different modifications in the activity, and the new compounds were assayed against A549, HBL-100, HeLa, SW1573, T-47D, and WiDr cell lines. Also, the potentiality to be P-gp substrate was tested. The compounds exhibited good antiproliferative results when compared with the standards cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. In silico studies to evaluate pharmacokinetic properties using pkCSM software were also carried out.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The deployment of multicomponent reactions (MCRs), defined as containing three or more reactants, not only enjoys pot, atom, and step&#8208;economy in the synthesis of novel complex molecules but also aligns with sustainable chemistry principles as a green symphony. Generally, more components lead to more complexity, and are taken to an extreme &#8216;&#8216;higher&#8208;order&#8217;&#8217; MCRs, where six or even more components react in a one&#8208;pot, have been developed, although they remain scarce compared to their 3, 4 and 5&#8208;component relatives. On this topic, the rich footprint of isocyanides in MCRs, in particular, has been fruitful in delivering higher order six to eight&#8208;component reactions through mechanistically similar pathways. The present review encompasses a brief history of MCRs and their product utility, followed by a thorough discussion of the principles of reaction design that enabled the discovery of higher&#8208;order MCRs, spanning 6 to 8&#8208;components. Future challenges and opportunities will also be elaborated.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Palladium&#8208;Photoredox catalyzed C&#8208;H functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalization of an unactivated C&#8208;H bonds is a highly desirable process in organic chemistry as it gives direct access to many new functional groups in a single step. This process is generally achieved using transition metal catalysts and among the transition metals studied for C&#8208;H activation, palladium plays an important role due to its unique reactivity. Photoredox catalysis has witnessed a huge surge in the last decade, and many new and valuable organic reactions are uncovered periodically. Dual transition metal &#8208; photoredox catalysis on the other hand, has taken organic synthesis to new heights by achieving transformations that were previously not possible or difficult to achieve by both forms of catalysis independently. In this direction, many new dual palladium&#8208;photoredox catalyzed C&#8208;H functionalization reactions have been reported in the past few years, and it is imperative to summarize these reactions for further developments in this area. We have divided this review into the following subsections: 1. C&#8208;H arylation, 2. C&#8208;H acylation, 3. C&#8208;H heteroatom functionalization, &amp; 4. C&#8208;H olefination.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure &#8211; Bioactivity Relationship in Cyclic Peptoids: An Overview</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic peptoids display remarkable biological activity thanks to their constitution and functionalization. This Review provides a systematic description of the bioactivities discovered so far, together with a complete structure&#8208;function relationship rationalization. Utilizing a strategic design for the synthesis of cyclic peptoids represents the starting point for further developments of these peptidomimetics as drug candidates.







Abstract
Cyclic N&#8208;substituted glycines oligomers, also known as cyclic peptoids, constitute a promising class of novel peptidomimetics, capable of simulating bioactive effectors with enhanced proteolytical stability and cell permeability as crucial bonuses. The macrocyclic constraint, essential for the induction of stable secondary structures, determines the biomimetic potential of such molecules, which act as antimicrobials, cytotoxic agents, siderophores, glycosidases inhibitors and so on. The bioactivity can be either attributed to the macrocyclic core (especially chelation) or to the side&#8208;chains (when endowed with specific groups or pharmacophores). The structure&#8208;bioactivity correlations emerging for this class of peptidomimetics, based on the study of conformational order and morphology of the backbone architecture, unravel interesting avenues for the rational design of more effective cyclooligomeric biomimics.

         <title>Cyclobutane Formation by the Reaction of Ethenesulfonyl Fluoride with Dimethyl Diazomalonate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Attempts to synthesize fluorosulfonyl&#8208;substituted pyrazolines by Huisgen reactions (1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions) of dimethyl diazomalonate with ethenesulfonyl fluoride led to the formation of dimethyl (2R*,3S*,4R*)&#8208;2&#8208;(1,3&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxopropan&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;3&#8208;(fluorosulfonyl)&#8208;4&#8208;((fluorosulfonyl)methyl)cyclo&#173;butane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylate, a highly substituted cyclobutane derivative, which was characterized by NMR spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The mechanism of its formation was elucidated by carrying out the reaction at different temperatures and workup conditions. It is shown that an initial 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition yields a pyrazoline which extrudes nitrogen with formation of 1&#8208;fluorosulfonyl&#8208;2,2&#8208;bis(methoxycarbonyl)cyclopropane and dimethyl 2&#8208;(2&#8208;(fluorosulfonyl)ethylidene)malonate, the latter of which dimerized during chromatography on silica gel with formation of the isolated cyclobutane.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Synthesis of Fused Polycyclic Heteroaromatics through Successive Vinylic/Aromatic C&#8722;F Bond Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of fused polycyclic heteroaromatics was achieved via successive vinylic/aromatic C&#8722;F bond activation. The Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling of bromodifluoroalkenes with 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208; or 2&#8208;aminophenylboronic acids (esters) followed by defluorinative 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization afforded 2&#8208;fluorobenzoheteroles bearing a biaryl moiety in one&#8208;pot operation. Subsequent acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular C&#8722;F/C&#8722;H coupling afforded tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208;, and hexacylic heteroaromatics.







Abstract
The synthesis of fused polycyclic heteroaromatics was achieved via successive vinylic/aromatic carbon&#8722;fluorine (C&#8722;F) bond activation. The Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling of (1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluorovinyl)biaryls with 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208; or 2&#8208;aminophenylboronic acids (esters) followed by defluorinative 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization yielded 2&#8208;fluorobenzofurans (indoles) with a biaryl moiety in one&#8208;pot operation. The obtained 2&#8208;fluorobenzoheteroles underwent acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular C&#8722;F/C&#8722;H coupling to yield tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208;, and hexacyclic heteroaromatics. This protocol allowed the synthesis of various substituted benzo&#8208;fused dibenzofurans and carbazoles.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Rich Carbon Dots as Novel Nano&#8208;Aminocatalytic Platforms in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of novel and effective metal&#8208;free catalytic systems, which can drive value&#8208;added organic transformations in environmentally benign solvents (for instance, water), is highly desirable. Moreover, these new catalysts need to be harmless, easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare, and potentially recyclable. In this context, amine&#8208;rich carbon dots (CDs) have recently emerged as promising nano&#8208;catalytic platforms. These nitrogen&#8208;doped nanoparticles, which show dimensions smaller than 10 nm, generally consist of carbon cores that are surrounded by shells containing numerous amino groups. In recent years, organic chemists have used these surface amines to guide the design of several synthetic methodologies under mild operative conditions. This Concept highlights the recent advances in the synthesis of amine&#8208;rich carbon dots and their applications in organic catalysis, including forward&#8208;looking opportunities within this research field.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Comparison of the Stability of Iminium Ions and Salts from Enals and Pyrrolidine Derivatives (Aminocatalysts)</title>

Iminium ions from pyrrolidines with substituents that can help stabilize the positive charge are especially stable in the gas phase, as expected, whereas in very polar solvents the predicted order of stability (of their iminium ions) is: O&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldi&#173;phenylsilylprolinol &gt; pyrrolidine &gt; O&#8208;methylprolinol &gt; 2&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyrrolidine &gt; J&#248;rgensen&#8211;Hayashi catalyst &gt; 2&#8208;tritylpyrrolidine &gt; N,N&#8208;dimethylprolin&#173;amide &gt; trimethylsilyl prolinate &gt; 3&#8208;triflamidopyrrolidine &gt; methyl prolinate &gt;&gt; MacMillan&#8208;1 catalyst &gt; MacMillan&#8208;2 catalyst.

         <title>1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of Alkanone Enolates with Azides in Deep Eutectic Solvents for the Metal&#8208;free Regioselective Synthesis of Densely Functionalized 1,2,3&#8208;Triazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An eco&#8208;friendly metal&#8208;free protocol was developed for the regioselective synthesis of densely functionalized 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles via a 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction of alkanone enolates with azides performed in the environmentally responsible choline chloride/urea or choline acetate/urea eutectic mixture. This approach displays a broad substrate scope, straightforwardly furnishing the desired triazoles (including the challenging phenolic derivatives) in yields of up to 98%, while working at room temperature and under aerobic conditions. The practicability of the method is exemplified by the sustainable synthesis of some pharmaceutically relevant triazole derivatives carried out via telescoped, one&#8208;pot cycloaddition/reduction processes in the same eutectic mixture without any halfway isolation/purification step of intermediates.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The Tsuji&#8208;Trost reaction of cyclopentenyl carbonates was explored by experimental studies and computational calculations, in search for the synthetic conditions enabing the stereoconvergent synthesis of cyclopentenyl nucleosides. Under common conditions, cyclopentenyl reagents provide Tsuji&#8208;Trost products only in a weakly stereoconvergent manner. However, changes in the amount of catalyst (up to 1 eq) affect either the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity&#160;of the reaction, selectively leading to  cis  configured&#160;cyclopentenyl N9&#8208;linked purine nucleosides, regardless the relative configuration (  cis  or  trans  ) of the starting substrates. DFT studies clarified that this could be due to the low activation energy related to the crucial, Pd&#8208;dependent &#960;&#8208;inversion step.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to Ketones through Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Phenol Derivatives with Nitroalkanes Followed by Nef Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A practical protocol for the synthesis of ketones by Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of phenol derivatives with nitroalkanes followed by a Nef&#8208;type reaction has been developed. The readily available nitroalkanes served as alkyl nucleophiles under basic conditions to couple with easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle phenol derivatives derived from naturally abundant phenols. The avoidance of using organometallics and organic halides makes this protocol more sustainable. The reaction was compatible with various functional groups, including nitro, cyano, acetyl, aldehyde, halide, and ester groups. Furthermore, the successful application of our method in drug synthesis exemplified its synthetic potential in pharmaceutical sciences. Preliminary mechanistic investigations strongly suggested the possible involvement of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted nitroalkane intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions and Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis: A Convenient Blend</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The most recent applications and possibilities of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions on solid phase are reviewed, which is a practical and fast strategy to cover current organic chemistry demands. Remarkably, solid&#8208;phase CuAAC and ring&#8208;closing metathesis have demonstrated an important role in synthetic biology, while more traditional Pd&#8208;catalyzed reactions, like Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura, Heck, and Sonogashira reactions, are valuable tools for accessing libraries of bioactive compounds.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed, C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming reactions have made an enormous impact in the way complex molecules are assembled. The benefits of solid&#8208;phase chemistry soon made this type of reaction applicable to solid&#8208;supported processes. In this review, we report the most recent applications and possibilities of this combination. Remarkably, the solid&#8208;phase CuAAC and ring&#8208;closing metathesis have demonstrated an important role in synthetic biology, alike more traditional Pd&#8208;catalyzed reactions, such as Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura, Heck, Sonogashira, which are valuable tools for accessing libraries of biologically relevant small molecules. Examples proved the validity of solid&#8208;phase transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions as a practical and fast strategy to cover the current organic chemistry demands.

         <title>6&#8208;Methylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;one Based Compounds as BRD9 Epigenetic Reader Binders: A Rational Combination of in silico Studies and Chemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>6&#8208;methylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;one&#8208;based compounds were here identified and synthesized as novel binders of bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 9 (BRD9) epigenetic reader. Accounting a fast and efficient synthetic route aimed to easily obtain differently 2&#8208; and 8&#8208;disubstituted 6&#8208;methylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;one derivatives, a virtual library of synthesizable items was built and submitted to molecular docking experiments. Based on two 3D structure&#8208;based pharmacophore models recently developed by us on BRD9, 16 compounds were selected and synthesized, using mild conditions with good yields in relatively short reaction times. Among them, 14, 16, 18, 22, and 26 emerged as the most potent compounds of these series, able to bind BRD9 at low micromolar range concentrations. These molecules also showed a promising selective behaviour when tested against BRD4 bromodomain. These results highlighted the quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;one chemical core as a valuable scaffold for developing promising BRD9 binders.</dc:description>

Accounting a fast and efficient synthetic route aimed to easily obtain differently 2- and 8-disubstituted 6-methylquinazolin-4(3H)-one derivatives, a virtual library of synthesizable items was built and submitted to molecular docking experiments. Based on two 3D structure-based pharmacophore models recently developed by us on BRD9, 16 compounds were selected and synthesized, using mild conditions with good yields in relatively short reaction times. Among them, 14, 16, 18, 22, and 26 emerged as the most potent compounds of these series, able to bind BRD9 at low micromolar range concentrations. These molecules also showed a promising selective behaviour when tested against BRD4 bromodomain. These results highlighted the quinazolin-4(3H)-one chemical core as a valuable scaffold for developing promising BRD9 binders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>A series of readily regenerable thioimidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquids possessing the ability to transfer an alkyl group to a nucleophile are immobilized on crosslinked polystyrene beads. Different alkyl groups can be loaded onto the resin, highlighting the tunability of the material. The efficiency of these materials is demonstrated by their screening against a series of nucleophiles, showing a particular preference for thiols. Finally, these materials were evaluated for use under continuous flow conditions. The flexibility, ease of use, safety, and recyclability of these alkylating resins shows promise for their use in large scale and automated applications.</dc:description>

         <title>20&#960; Antiaromatic Isophlorins without Metallation or Core Modification</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isophlorins (two&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced porphyrins) with 20&#960; antiaromaticity have been synthesized by metallation or core modification (replacing the inner NHs with less bulky atoms) thus far. The core&#8208;modification number (CMN) is an important factor for the stability of isophlorins against their oxidation to porphyrins. However, isophlorins with small CMN (&#8804; 2), i.e., without significant core modification, are difficult to synthesize and important for understanding their structure&#8211;antiaromaticity relationships. Herein, we report the synthesis of free&#8208;base (metal&#8208;free) antiaromatic isophlorins with no core modification (CMN=0) for the first time in the literature. &#946;&#8208;Tetracyanoporphyrins were successfully reduced by hydrazine to their corresponding isophlorins under aerobic conditions. These porphyrin/isophlorin transformations are reversible. Their structure and antiaromaticity were studied via 1 H NMR and UV&#8208;vis/near&#8208;infrared absorption spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction and theoretical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Complementary Cooperative Catalytic Systems in the Aerobic Oxidation of a Wide Range of Si&#8211;H&#8208;Reagents to Si&#8211;OH&#8208;Products: From Monomers to Oligomers and Polymers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The article presents an in&#8208;depth study of the applicability of cooperative [M]&#8208;/Organo&#8208;catalytic systems in aerobic Si&#8211;H&#8208;functionalization. A thorough kinetic study allowed us to identify two &#8220;complementary&#8221; catalytic systems based on earth&#8208;abundant [M]&#8208;catalysts and inexpensive commercially available organic catalysts. The first system, Co(OAc)  2  /N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide, made it possible to oxidize a Si&#8211;H&#8208;group to a Si&#8211;OH&#8208;group in a wide range of monomers, including previously unknown ones, that dramatically differ in their reactivity. However, this system failed in the case of oligomeric and polymeric substrates. This problem was solved by application of the Cu(OAc)  2  /N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide system. A wide potential for gram&#8208;scale (50&#8208;100 g) preparation of Si&#8211;OH&#8208;containing products with molecular architectures of different complexity was revealed using the established &#8220;substrate&#8208;reactivity&#8208;catalytic system&#8221; relationship. In particular, previously unknown types of dumbbell&#8208;shaped and graft polymers were synthesized using alkoxysilanols.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent developments in the synthesis of polyhydroxylated indolizidines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since their discovery, polyhydroxylated indolizidines have been the focus of attention for both biologists and synthetic chemists. They are classified as iminosugar alkaloids: nitrogen&#8208;based carbohydrate mimetics that are potent inhibitors of glycosidases. Many discovered glycosidase inhibitors were found to possess biological activity, and they are therefore considered to be potential therapeutics in the treatment of various diseases such as viral infections, diabetes, or cancer. Not surprisingly, the interest in the preparation of these substances has been enormous. This review presents the latest developments in the synthesis of naturally occurring polyhydroxylated indolizidines and their synthetic enantiomers. In addition, the synthesis of several novel polyhydroxylated indolizidines, which were discovered to have inhibitory activity, is reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Based Imidazolium Salt as Dual Lewis Acid and Redox Catalyst for the Aerobic Synthesis of Quinazolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A low transition temperature mixture formed with &#160;1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;(methoxycarbonylmethyl)imidazolium chloride and iron(III) chloride has proven to be an efficient catalyst for the synthesis of quinazolines following a sequence of condensation&#8208;cyclization&#8208;oxidation reactions. The protocol is simple and effective for coupling 2&#8208;acylanilines and benzylamines to form nitrogen containing heterocycles with moderate to excellent yields (up to 93%), being possible to perform the reaction in preparative scale. The functionalized imidazolium salt is crucial for the activation of the reagents under solvent&#8208;free conditions, and the presence of iron in the&#160;catalyst mediates the oxidation step with atmospheric oxygen. These features make the presented procedure better, from an environmental point of view, than other processes previously described. For this comparison, different "green" metrics have been used, such as atom economy, stoichiometric factor, reaction mass efficiency, E&#8208;factor and EcoScale.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;mediated C4&#8208;selective C&#8208;H&#8208;sulfonylation of pyridine.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct regioselective C&#8208;H&#8208;functionalization of simple, unfunctionalized pyridines is considered a long&#8208;standing challenge in heterocyclic chemistry. Herein, we report a novel one&#8208;pot protocol for the C4&#8208;selective sulfonylation of pyridines via triflic anhydride (Tf2O) activation, base&#8208;mediated addition of a sulfinic acid salt and subsequent elimination/rearomatization. Contrary to previous approaches employing tailored blocking groups, positional selectivity can be controlled by using N&#8208;methyl piperidine as simple, readily available external base. This method offers a highly modular and streamlined access to C4&#8208;sulfonylated pyridines.</dc:description>

         <title>Expeditious Synthesis of a Glycopeptide Library</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new reactor design with optimized reaction conditions provides a route for glycopeptides synthesis within minutes by using equimolar quantities of glycosylated amino acids. This enabled the assembly of a proteoglycan&#8208;derived glycopeptide library in a matter of hours.







Abstract
Short proteoglycan fragments are of great importance for biochemical research. The solid&#8208;phase synthesis of such glycopeptides relies on excessive use of glycosylated amino acids, extended reaction times, and additional post&#8208;assembly deprotection protocols. We employed high&#8208;shear mixing for expedient and equimolar O&#8208;glycopeptide assembly. We further developed a stirring&#8208;based deprotection on the solid support, thus completing the synthesis of a glycopeptide library in a minimal amount of time and purification hurdles.

         <title>Asymmetric Cycloaddition/Annulation Reactions by Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalysis: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric cycloaddition/annulation reactions have contributed greatly to the synthesis of a variety of novel cyclic compounds used in organic synthesis, natural product synthesis, material science, and chemical biology. Thus, chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cycloaddition reactions have received the attention of synthetic community to design new vital asymmetric reactions and synthesize complex molecules for the past two decades. Although several review articles on organocatalyzed asymmetric cycloaddition reactions can be found in the literature, there has been no specific review on CPA&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cycloaddition/annulation reactions. Herein, the most recent research progress on chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed asymmetric [3+2], [4+2], [2+2], [3+3], [4+3], [4+1] annulation and 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions have been compiled and analyzed to demonstrate the importance of chiral phosphoric acid catalysis in asymmetric cycloaddition or annulation reactions.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzothiazinones are a structural motif found in biologically active compounds, such as the clinical candidates BTZ&#8208;043 and Macozinone for the treatment of tuberculosis. We describe a robust, two&#8208;step method to synthesize 2&#8208;amino&#8208;substituted benzothiazinones from benzoyl thiocarbamates, which were prepared in a one&#8208;pot procedure from benzoyl chlorides. The intramolecular cyclization and ethoxy displacement steps were also amenable to adoption in continuous flow as exemplified by select substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of a Bioactive Lignanamide Using a 5&#8208;endo&#8208;tet&#8208;Type Cyclization of Activated Cyclopropylcarbinols and Synthetic Support for the Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective total synthesis of a bioactive lignanamide with high enantiomeric excess was accomplished. The key synthetic steps include an organocatalytic enantioselective cyclopropanation and a Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated chirality&#8208;transferring 5&#8208;endo&#8208;tet&#8208;type cyclization of a D&#8722;A cyclopropylcabinol, which proceeds with a very high level of stereoinduction. Based on the obtained experimental evidence, a feasible mechanism for the crucial 5&#8208;endo&#8208;tet&#8208;type cyclization is proposed.







Abstract
The first enantioselective total synthesis of a bioactive lignanamide was achieved with high enantiomeric excess. Key synthetic steps include an organocatalytic enantioselective cyclopropanation and a Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated chirality&#8208;transferring 5&#8208;endo&#8208;tet&#8208;type cyclization that proceeds with a very high degree of stereoinduction. The proposed mechanism of the key reaction is supported by the experimental results. Based on these experimental results, the 5&#8208;endo&#8208;tet&#8208;type cyclization of a cyclopropylcarbinol proceeds predominantly via an SN1 mechanism with high trans&#8208;selectivity, which arises from the steric hindrance of the neighboring substituent. Minor pathways include the anchimeric participation of (i)&#8197;the oxygen atom of the benzoyl group in an SN2 mechanism and/or (ii)&#8197;a benzene&#8208;coordinated transition state in an SN1&#8208;like mechanism.

Based on these experimental results, the &lt;i&gt;5-endo-tet&lt;/i&gt;-type cyclization of a cyclopropylcarbinol proceeds predominantly via an S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1 mechanism with high &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity, which arises from the steric hindrance of the neighboring substituent. Minor pathways include the anchimeric participation of (i)&#8197;the oxygen atom of the benzoyl group in an S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 mechanism and/or (ii)&#8197;a benzene-coordinated transition state in an S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1-like mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
New peptidomimetics containing a &#946;2,2&#8208;isoxazoline amino acid, 5&#8208;(aminomethyl)&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydroisoxazole&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylic acid (Isox&#8208;&#946;2,2AA), were prepared and studied by NMR and theoretical calculations. Interestingly, inserting R&#8208;Isox&#8208;&#946;2,2AA in short tri&#8208; and hexapeptide models, an unexpected &#945;&#8208;turn&#8208;like motif was observed, thanks to an unprecedented strong H&#8208;bond involving C=N of isoxazoline side chain of &#946;2,2AA.

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine&#8208;Mediated Azidation Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic azides have found wide application in various fields of science and technology. This review summarizes recently developed approaches to the direct, one&#8208;step synthesis of diverse organic azides utilizing hypervalent iodine reagents. The first part of review deals with the azidation using unstable azidoiodinanes generated  in situ  from common hypervalent iodine reagents (such as diacetoxyiodobenzene or iodosylbenzene) and a source of azide anion (TMSN3  or NaN3  ). The second part of review is dedicated to the application of stable azidobenziodoxoles as useful azidating reagents that allow selective direct azidation of C&#8208;H bonds or double carbon&#8208;carbon bonds under mild reaction conditions. The use of azidobenziodoxoles eliminates the main disadvantages of the traditional approaches to organic azides, such as the need in pre&#8208;functionalization of organic substrates and harsh reaction conditions. Synthetic application of azidobenziodoxoles made possible direct selective azidation of a plethora of organic substrates including complex molecules at the late synthetic stage.</dc:description>

         <title>Mannich Reaction: An Alternative Synthetic Approach for Various Pyrrole&#8208;Based Anion Receptors and Chelating Ligands</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presented review highlights the synthetic development of structurally diverse pyrrole&#8208;based Mannich bases. The Mannich reaction approach discussed here serves as an alternative reaction strategy compared to the conventionally employed condensation reactions. Applications of Mannich bases as anion receptors, chelating ligands, and precursors for further reactions are described.







Abstract
This review article highlights the synthetic design of various pyrrole&#8208;based acyclic, tripodal, macrocyclic, and macrobicyclic Mannich bases and their applications, mainly as anion receptors. By varying the amine&#8208;types and molar proportions of reagents, a range of value&#8208;added Mannich bases are obtained. Herein, the synthesis and properties of several azacalixpyrroles, azacalixdipyrrolylmethanes, and azacryptands are discussed. Emphasis is also given to the applications of pyrrole&#8208;based Mannich bases in the construction of some chelating ligands as one of the steps in multistep organic syntheses. In addition, the use of Mannich products as ligands for synthesizing metal complexes is also described. More importantly, the establishment of Mannich reactions as an alternative approach for traditionally used Schiff's base or aldehyde/ketone&#8208;condensation reactions is delineated.

         <dc:description>Organolithium reagents are one of the most widely used reagents in chemical synthesis. Herein, we reported the first study of organolithium reagents used in asymmetric allylic alkylation (AAA) reactions with racemic cyclic substrates. A simple and efficient Cu&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of enantiomerically enriched cycloalkene derivatives from various racemic cyclic allylic bromides was developed. The standard method employed 5% CuBr&#183;SMe  2  in combination with phosphoramidite ligand  L2  in DCM. Meanwhile, transfer of the reactions into flow condition for more convenient application was also studied. This new Cu&#8208;catalyzed protocol was speculated to undergo an enantioconvergent transformation mechanism here.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Functionalization of Lithium Phosphine Oxides bearing an Alkyne chain</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient synthesis of functionalized alkynyl phosphine oxides is described. The current approach is based on the activation of the phosphorus&#8211;hydrogen bond (P&#8211;H bond) of a secondary phosphine oxide. After the deprotonation step using  n  &#8208;butyllithium, the  in&#8208;situ  generated LiP(O)RR&#8217; undergoes further condensation with a wide variety of electrophiles, and without a cyclisation step into the alkyne as a side reaction. In particular, the addition to aldehydes proceeds quickly and gives access to  &#945;  &#8208;hydroxy phosphine oxides, with a diastereoselectivity rate up to 80/20.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Thioalkynes by Desilylative Sonogashira Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aryl Iodides and 1&#8208;Methylthio&#8208;2&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)ethyne</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and operationally straightforward synthesis of 1&#8208;methylthio&#8208;2&#8208;arylethyne derivatives is described based on a desilylative Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling between aryl iodides and a silylated surrogate for methylthioacetylene (Me3SiCCSMe). Extension of the process to a selection of other thioether types is also documented.







Abstract
1&#8208;Methylthio&#8208;2&#8208;arylethynes were prepared in typically good to excellent yields from aryl iodides and 1&#8208;methylthio&#8208;2&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)ethyne by a desilylative Sonogashira process employing Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%), CuI (10&#8197;mol&#8201;%), and K2CO3 (6 eq) in MeOH&#8208;Et3N&#8208;THF (1&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2) at rt for 16&#8197;h (16 examples, 31&#8211;96&#8201;% yield). Thienyl and pyridyl iodides (all regioisomers) were similarly converted to 1&#8208;methylthio&#8208;2&#8208;heteroarylethynes (5 examples, 54&#8211;82&#8201;% yield). The process was extended with similar results to comparable thioalkynes substituted on sulfur by n&#8208;alkyl, s&#8208;alkyl, and aryl groups.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Aryl Lactams by Heck&#8208;Matsuda and Heck&#8208;Mizoroki Arylations of Enelactams</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effective enantioselective arylation of enelactams using chiral N,N&#8208;ligands was accomplished by using arenediazonium salts or aryl iodides. The use of these distinct electrophiles allowed for the synthesis of several enantioenriched &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aryl lactams in moderate to good yields in enantiomeric ratios of up to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5. A rationale for the enantioselective process was constructed by an extensive investigation using DFT calculations.







Abstract
The chiral aryl lactam nucleus is a common motif present in many bioactive natural products and the development of effective enantioselective methodologies for its preparation is of great interest. In this work, we report the synthesis of several enantioenriched aryl lactams in good yields and enantiomeric ratios using a combined strategy employing arenediazonium salts bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents, aryl iodides with electron&#8208;donating substituents, and chiral N,N&#8208;ligands. The chiral &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aryl lactams were obtained in yields of up to 78&#8201;% and enantiomeric ratios up to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the use of chiral N,N&#8208;ligands as a viable alternative to the phosphine&#8208;based ligands in the enantioselective Heck&#8208;Mizoroki reactions using aryl iodides. The origins of the enantioselectivity and the full catalytic cycle for the Heck&#8208;Matsuda arylation of the enelactams were investigated through DFT calculations.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Synthesis of Ynenamides through Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkynylation of Ynamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using gold(I) catalysts, terminal acetylenes bearing different substituents can be added to ynamides. The hydroalkynylation reaction is highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective. Experiments and quantum chemical calculations reveal a mechanism via dual gold catalysis.







Abstract
Transition metal catalysis is a useful tool for C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reactions. Of special interest is the hydroalkynylation reaction of alkynes, which provides a simple method for the synthesis of enynes representing interesting structural motifs in organic chemistry. So far, there are only a few examples of gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkynylation reactions. Herein, we were able to show experimentally that the gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkynylation of ynamides leads regio&#8208; and stereoselectively to the corresponding ynenamides, a rather unknown type of molecule. A wide range of products could be generated with yields up to 90&#8201;% and, in contrast to many other gold&#8208;catalyzed alkyne dimerization reactions, alkyl groups are tolerated. Quantum chemical calculations and NMR labelling experiments reveal a mechanism via dual gold catalysis.

         <title>New Insights into the Exploitation of BODIPY Derivatives as Organic Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed structure&#8208;activity relationship study onto six different BODIPY photocatalysts was performed towards a synthetically relevant atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reaction. The presence of heavy atoms in the chromophore's core was revealed to be essential for high reactivity levels. On the contrary, electron&#8208;withdrawing groups at the meso position deteriorated the catalytic performances, consistently with the proposed reaction mechanism.







Abstract
Boron&#8208;dipyrromethene complexes (BODIPYs) are attracting a growing interest for their notable photophysical properties. Specifically, their application in organic photocatalysis is receiving particular attention thanks to their ability to undergo both electron and energy transfer processes, thus acting as promising photoredox catalysts and photosensitizers. Although the number of examples employing these organic dyes is constantly increasing, there are not so many studies that correlate their chemical composition to their photocatalytic activity. In this work, a rationally designed structure&#8208;activity relationship study was performed by selecting a synthetically relevant atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reaction as a benchmark. We demonstrated how the presence of heavy atoms in the chromophore's core turned out to be essential for achieving high reactivity levels. On the contrary, electron&#8208;withdrawing groups in position 8 (meso) undermined the catalytic performances, in agreement with the proposed reaction mechanism.

A new N&#8208;iodosuccinimide&#8208;mediated intramolecular oxidation to construct C&#8722;O bonds has been developed. The reaction differs in the construction of the C&#8722;N bond from the classic and modified Hofmann&#8208;L&#246;ffler&#8208;Freytag reactions.

In this work, we describe the N&#8208;iodosuccinimide&#8208;mediated benzyl sp3 C&#8722;H oxidation of 2&#8208;alkyl&#8208;substituted benzamide derivatives. This Hofmann&#8208;L&#246;ffler&#8208;Freytag (HLF) type reaction involving intramolecular sp3 C&#8722;O bond formation differs from the construction of the C&#8722;N bond in the classic and modified HLF reactions. This reaction proceeded smoothly via 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer of N&#8208;centered radicals directly afforded by in&#8197;situ N&#8722;I bond generation, providing iminoisobenzofuran derivatives in moderate to excellent yields with exclusive chemoselectivity.

         <title>Stereocontrolling Effect of a Single Triisopropylsilyl Group in 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;Glucosylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycosylation with thioglucosides with a single triisopropylsilyl (TIPS) group at O&#8208;2 is highly 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;stereoselective when weak nucleophiles (ROH) are used. Glycosylation proceeds along the SN1&#8208;like pathway via glycosyl cation, which is locked in 4H3 conformation with bulky TIPS group in the pseudo&#8208;equatorial position.







Abstract
Glycosylation with phenyl 3,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;O&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;2&#8208;O&#8208;triisopropylsilyl (TIPS)&#8208;1&#8208;thio&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucopyranoside is highly 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;stereoselective, while the use of 2,3&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;TIPS glucosyl donor with benzoyl groups at O&#8208;4 and O&#8208;6 results in the loss of &#945;&#8208;stereoselectivity (&#945;/&#946;=3&#8201;:&#8201;1). Complete &#945;&#8208;stereocontrol with 2&#8208;O&#8208;TIPS substituted glucosyl donors could only be achieved in glucosylation of weak nucleophiles. In this case, the glucosylation seems to proceed along the SN1&#8208;like pathway via the 4H3 conformer of glycosyl cation stabilized by the bulky TIPS group at O&#8208;2.

         <title>Catalytic Isomerization of Unprotected Mesoionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins and Their Lewis Adducts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extensive DFT calculations show that the isomerization of C5&#8208;unprotected mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (mNHOs) to more Lewis basic mesoionic carbenes (MICs) can be efficiently catalyzed by weakly protic acidic species including unprotected mNHO, MIC, their Lewis adducts and polar H2O molecules, thus enabling catalytic isomerization and H&#8208;isotope exchange reactions of such mNHOs and their Lewis adducts.







Abstract
Recently, novel C5&#8208;position&#8208;unprotected mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (mNHOs) demonstrated interesting reactivity with various Lewis acids during experiments. In this work, extensive DFT calculations show that the isomerization of such mNHOs to more Lewis&#8208;basic mesoionic carbenes (MICs) can be efficiently catalyzed by weakly protic acidic species including C5&#8208;unprotected mNHOs, their Lewis adducts and polar H2O molecules, thus enabling catalytic isomerization and H&#8208;isotope exchange of such mNHOs and their Lewis adducts.

         <title>A Green Multicomponent Domino Mannich&#8208;Michael Reaction to Synthesize Novel Naphthoquinone&#8208;Polyphenols with Antiproliferative and Antioxidant Activities</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes a new methodology to synthesize novel naphthoquinone polyphenols. These compounds were submitted to CRAC assays, and, in general, showed antioxidant activities superior to Trolox. In addition, the antiproliferative activity of the most active compounds showed IC50 values for HCT116 and PC3 comparable to those of 5&#8208;fluorouracil and superior to doxorubicin in HL60 and SNB19 human cancer cells.







Abstract
This study reports on the one&#8208;step, green, catalyst&#8208;free synthesis of new naphthoquinone&#8208;polyphenols through an innovative method using the multicomponent domino Mannich&#8211;Michael reaction in the lawsone. After optimized condition reactions, twelve novel naphthoquinone polyphenols were synthesized with good yields. The polyphenols were tested on four cancer cell lines (HCT116, PC3, HL60, and SNB19), in which the best results showed antiproliferative activity with IC50 of 25.83&#8211;47.95&#8197;&#956;M. Additionally, we used the CRAC assay to quantify the antioxidant capacity of each compound and determined a hierarchy based on the Trolox equivalent values.

         <dc:description>
H&#8208;bonded counterion&#8208;directed catalysis has been applied to the enantioselective tandem cycloisomerization&#8208;addition to 2&#8208;alkynyl enones. The addition of C&#8208;, N&#8208; or O&#8208;centered nucleophiles catalyzed by a phosphinosquaramide Au(I) chloride/chiral Ag(I) phosphoramidate system afforded bicyclic furans in moderate to excellent yield and enantioselectivity (28 examples, 59&#8211;96&#8201;% yield, 62&#8201;:&#8201;38 to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 er).







Abstract
H&#8208;bonded counterion&#8208;directed catalysis (HCDC) is a strategy wherein a chiral anion that is hydrogen&#8208;bonded to the achiral ligand of a metal complex is responsible for enantioinduction. In this article we present the application of H&#8208;bonded counterion&#8208;directed catalysis to the Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective tandem cycloisomerization&#8208;addition reaction of 2&#8208;alkynyl enones. Following the addition of C&#8208;, N&#8208; or O&#8208;centered nucleophiles, bicyclic furans were obtained in moderate to excellent yield and enantioselectivity (28 examples, 59&#8211;96&#8201;% yield, 62&#8201;:&#8201;38 to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 er). The optimal catalytic system, comprising a phosphinosquaramide Au(I) chloride complex and a BINOL&#8208;derived phosphoramidate Ag(I) salt, was selected in a combinatorial fashion from a larger library with the help of high&#8208;throughput screening. An enantioselectivity switch of ca. 120 &#916;ee% was observed upon addition of the achiral Au(I) component to the Ag(I) salt.

         <title>Reassignment of Improbable Natural Products Identified through Chemical Principle Screening</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure elucidation of complex natural products remains exceedingly reliant on a multitude of spectroscopic outputs, resulting in an elevated propensity to propose erroneous solutions. In this work concepts aimed to assist practitioners in identifying erroneous chemical structures are presented, along with nine examples to demonstrate approaches to solve and reassign natural product chemical structure employing a combination of CASE and DFT spectrum prediction with chemical intuition oversight.







Abstract
Natural products continue to be reported at an astonishing rate from a wide range of multidisciplinary research activities in the pursuit of understanding the chemistry of biodiversity. However, the elucidation of chemical structure in the modern era is heavily reliant on the analysis and interpretation of multiple spectroscopic outputs, and in most cases this activity is by no means trivial. Structural errors continue to be described given the inherent complexity of natural products. Computer&#8208;Assisted Structure Elucidation (CASE) continues to provide improved resolving power in this regard, but for enhanced accuracy quantum chemical spectrum prediction methodology is paramount. Reported herein are a range of counterfactual natural products, identified through chemical principal screening, which have been reassigned using a combination of chemical intuition, chemical synthesis, CASE and DU8+ spectrum prediction.

         <title>Organocatalytic One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Pseudo&#8208;Terpenoids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;pot synthesis of terpenoids: An organocatalytic coupling and annulation methodology was developed for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of structurally complex cedrane scaffolds in very good yields with high chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. It represents a highly economical, novel, and green method for the cedrane scaffolds synthesis.







Abstract
Structurally complex cedrane scaffolds were synthesized in very good yields with high chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivities in a sequential one&#8208;pot manner. A combination of intermolecular olefination, intramolecular Michael and Michael reactions or intermolecular olefination, intramolecular Michael and aldol reactions were used as the key steps from the readily available hydroxy&#8208;p&#8208;quinone butanals and phosphoranes with catalytic amounts of quinine at ambient temperatures for a few hours. This is a unique one&#8208;pot combination of coupling and annulation routes for the green synthesis of a library of tricyclic pseudo&#8208;terpenoids (cedrane scaffolds) with high selectivity and yields. Organocatalytic ring isomerization was highlighted through transforming one ring into another one by retro&#8208;cyclization. We have discussed thoroughly mechanistic aspects of these tandem coupling/annulation and ring isomerization reactions based on control experiments and X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis.

         <dc:description>
This review outlines a handful of transformations employing transition&#8208;metal and photoredox catalysis by auxiliary&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H activation strategy to assemble synthetic libraries of C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. The review also features the substrate scope and mechanistic insights of the key methodologies.







Abstract
Metallaphotoredox catalysis represents the combination of two activation modes: metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization and visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photocatalysis. This appealing dual catalysis technique has evolved as a versatile platform that has paved the way for diverse low&#8208;energy pathways for a plethora of synthetic transformations. The synergistic combination of two &#8220;green&#8221; approaches has garnered enormous interest owing to the development of sustainable strategies. In the recent past, significant advancements have been accomplished in constructing site&#8208;selective C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. This review outlines the use of photoredox catalysis in directing group&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H functionalization reactions. The mechanistic insights of the developments and synthetic applications are addressed.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of 2,6&#8208;Disubstituted Cuneanes through Enantioselective Constitutional Isomerization of 1,4&#8208;Disubstituted Cubanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2,6&#8208;Substituted cuneanes were obtained by metal&#8208;catalyzed isomerization of 1,4&#8208;disubstituted cubanes and are stable cage&#8208;like hexahedral compounds with C2v symmetry. In this process, the chiral cage&#8208;like hexahedral hydrocarbon in one step. The asymmetric induction was performed using chiral P&#8722;C&#8722;P pincer Pd catalyst. The obtained cuneane will be a novel chiral scaffold.







Abstract
2,6&#8208;Disubstituted cuneane has potential as a p&#8208;disubstituted benzene bioisostere and a novel chiral scaffold. It is a constitutional isomer of a 1,4&#8208;disubstituted cubane obtained via a metal&#8208;catalyzed skeletal rearrangement. Unlike the highly symmetrical 1,4&#8208;disubstituted cubane, the isomerized 2,6&#8208;disubstituted cuneane is a chiral molecule possessing C2 symmetry. Examining various chiral catalysts revealed that the Pd&#8208;pincer catalyst provides a good asymmetric induction.

         <title>Organocatalytic Synthesis of Thiiranes from Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, sustainable and efficient organocatalytic synthesis of thiiranes from alkenes has been developed. Starting from olefins and utilizing the epoxidation protocol developed in the Kokotos&#8217; group, which employs 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroacetophenone as the organocatalyst and H2O2 as the oxidant, followed by ring opening by thiourea, a variety of thiiranes were synthesized in moderate to excellent yields.







Abstract
Thiiranes, the corresponding sulfur analogues of epoxides, are less studied and less encountered in literature. This might be due to the limited existing synthetic approaches for their synthesis. Herein, a mild, sustainable and efficient organocatalytic synthesis of thiiranes has been developed. Starting from olefins and utilizing the epoxidation protocol developed in the Kokotos&#8217; group, which employs 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroacetophenone as the organocatalyst and H2O2 as the oxidant, followed by ring opening by thiourea, a variety of thiiranes were synthesized. Both aromatic and aliphatic moieties are well tolerated, leading to thiiranes in moderate to excellent yields.

         <title>A Steroidal Molecular Rotor with Fast Solid&#8208;State Dynamics Obtained by Crystal Engineering: Role of the Polarity of the Stator</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theoretical/experimental study is presented for a set of Steroidal Molecular Rotors (SMRs). Extensive DFT computations and SXRD experiments revealed a potential correlation between the polarity of the stator and the rotational activation energy. Following this crystal engineering criterium we report a rare example of a SMR with fast rotational dynamics in spite of featuring a crystallographically crowded rotator.







Abstract

     alt="A Steroidal Molecular Rotor with Fast Solid-State Dynamics Obtained by Crystal Engineering: Role of the Polarity of the Stator"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A theoretical/experimental study is presented for a set of Steroidal Molecular Rotors (SMRs). Extensive DFT computations and SXRD experiments revealed a potential correlation between the polarity of the stator and the rotational activation energy. Following this crystal engineering criterium we report a rare example of a SMR with fast rotational dynamics in spite of featuring a crystallographically crowded rotator.

         <title>Cyclization Strategies Using Imide Derivatives for the Synthesis of Polycyclic Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main synthetic strategies to convert cyclic imides into polycyclic amine derivatives are revised. These synthetic routes have been classified according to their key features: N&#8208;acyliminium ions&#8208;based reactions, electrophilic activation of imides, use of strong nucleophiles, radicals&#8208;based methods, and miscellaneous strategies.







Abstract
Cyclization strategies employing imides and their derivatives have attracted the attention of several organic chemists interested in synthesizing polycyclic alkaloids. Numerous strategies have been developed, mostly focused on i) the use of masked iminium ions, ii) addition of weak nucleophiles onto the carbonyl group of the imide being activated by a Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acid, iii) addition of strong nucleophiles onto the imide carbonyl, iv) radical&#8208;based processes and v) miscellaneous methods. This review is not comprehensive. It aims to provide the reader with a selection of representative synthetic strategies available in the area up to date.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;O Bond Formation by Directing Group Assisted C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic Csp2&#8722;H oxygenation is a challenging transformation in organic synthesis owing to its selectivity and efficiency. This Review highlights recent advances in the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;selective Csp2&#8722;H alkoxylation and acetoxylation of unactivated Csp2&#8211;H bonds using different types of directing groups.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed Csp2&#8722;H oxygenation is a synthetically invaluable transformation that enables the incorporation of synthetically useful functional groups, such as ethers and acetates, using a simple protocol. Compared to the well&#8208;developed palladium catalysis, the catalysis of cobalt, a 3d&#8208;transition metal, is recognized as a sustainable alternative for Csp2&#8722;H oxygenation because of the natural abundance of cobalt and cost&#8208;effectiveness of the catalyst. In this Review, recent advances in cobalt&#8208;catalyzed Csp2&#8722;H alkoxylation and acetoxylation are highlighted and several types of directing groups are discussed.

         <title>Improved Synthesis Strategy for N&#8208;Methoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazinane Nucleic Acids (MOANAs)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Condensation with 4&#8208;(benzoyloxy)benzaldehyde provides easy access to a protected phosphoramidite building block of (2R,3S)&#8208;4&#8208;(methoxyamino)butane&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triol, used as the backbone scaffold in the synthesis of N&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazinane nucleic acids (MOANAs). The resulting N&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2&#8208;[4&#8208;(benzoyloxy)phenyl]&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazinane moiety is stable under the conditions of oligonucleotide synthesis but readily hydrolyzed afterwards. Stability of the protection can be adjusted predictably by changing the substituent on the phenyl ring.







Abstract
Dependence of the hydrolysis rate of a series of N&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazinanes on the Hammett substituent constant of the substituent of the phenyl ring was determined, yielding a reaction constant &#961;=&#8722;1.40&#177;0.05. Based on this information, 4&#8208;(benzoyloxy)benzaldehyde was selected as a protecting group for a new (2R,3S)&#8208;4&#8208;(methoxyamino)butane&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triol phosphoramidite building block. The yield of the preparation of this building block as well as its coupling in automated oligonucleotide synthesis were greatly improved compared to the method reported previously. The 2&#8208;[4&#8208;(benzoyloxy)phenyl]&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazine protection persisted throughout the synthesis of short oligonucleotides but was rapidly removed when the oligonucleotides were released from solid support and dissolved in water.

         <title>Chemical Tools for the Temporal Control of Water Solution pH and Applications in Dissipative Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical reagents and methodologies (tools) employed for accurately and precisely programming over time the pH of a water solution are described in detail. For each tool, a number of selected examples is reported in order to show its feasibility and usefulness







Abstract
The chemical reagents used to achieve a predictable and programmable time control of the pH of water solutions are reviewed with the purpose to present a toolbox of instruments to be used when a precise pH vs time profile is needed. These tools are particularly useful in view of the growing interest on dissipative systems, many of which operate in water solutions, under the action of reagents (chemical fuels) that allow for programmed pH evolution. After a brief introduction describing the importance of such tools for the operation of dissipative systems in water, five sections follow, which illustrate the different method used so far to temporally control the pH of a water solution. In particular, time&#8208;programmable pH variations based on: 1) bubbling of gases (CO2, N2, Air), 2) hydrolysis of esters, lactones and sultones, 3) enzymatic and biocatalytic networks, 4) decarboxylation reaction of activated carboxylic acids, and 5) pH&#8208;oscillators are described together with selected examples of application.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Metal&#8208;Free Chlorodifluoromethylation of Arenes and Heteroarenes by a Hypervalent Iodine EDA Complex</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light&#8208;mediated electron donor&#8211;acceptor complex enabling direct chlorodifluoromethylation of (hetero)arenes is described. This method provides the privileged moiety with mild conditions across a broad range of functional groups and bioactive scaffolds. Post&#8208;functionalization reactions and key control experiments are reported as well. The core EDA complex is studied spectroscopically, enabling further synthetic applications in the future.







Abstract
A novel EDA complex comprised of a bis(chlorodifluoroacetoxy)iodoarene and 1,3,5&#8208;trimethoxybenzene is described, which enables the direct radical C(sp2)&#8722;H chlorodifluoromethylation of arenes and heteroarenes under monochromatic visible&#8208;light irradiation. The procedure is mild, operationally simple, and utilizes commercially available reagents. The developed conditions demonstrate compatibility with a host of commonly encountered functionalities and biologically relevant scaffolds, whilst showcasing the post&#8208;functionalization capabilities of the &#8722;CF2Cl moiety. Various mechanistic studies were performed to explore the EDA complex and radical generation pathway.

         <title>Biocatalytic Kinetic Resolution to Access Enantiomerically Enriched Dihydropyrimidinone/Thiones through Recognition of a Remote Stereocentre</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocatalytic and enantioselective methodology for the synthesis of dihydropyrimidinone/thiones was developed using lipase B from Candida antarctica. The results were promising even in cases in which the stereogenic centre was in remote positions from the reaction site (ee values up to 99&#8201;%). Molecular docking studies were performed to support the stereospecificity observed for the products formed.







Abstract
The Biginelli synthesis is a classic tricomponent reaction known to result in polyfunctionalized dihydropyrimidinone (DHPM) derivatives. Herein, we described a chemo&#8208;enzymatic strategy for obtaining enantiomerically enriched hydroxy&#8208;DHPMs. These compounds were previously esterified with butyric or acetic anhydride and were later submitted to hydrolysis reactions catalysed by lipase B from Candida antarctica. Although the stereogenic centre is far from the reaction site (4&#8211;5&#8197;bonds), moderate to excellent enantiomeric excess values were obtained (up to 99&#8201;%). Docking studies were performed in parallel to elucidate the binding modes of some molecules with the CALB active site, and were able to provide information on the enantiospecificity of these compounds in the hydrolysis reaction.

         <title>Mechanistic Aspects of the Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation in the Manufacture of Noradrenaline</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The only stereoselective process for the manufacture of noradrenaline known in the literature, an asymmetric transfer hydrogenation, was studied through a catalyst screening and expanded to hydrogenation conditions. The transition states geometries, when using the most stereoselective catalyst, are then evaluated through a computational study.







Abstract
Mechanistic, stereochemical and stereoelectronic aspects of the asymmetric reduction (via hydrogen or transfer hydrogenation) for the manufacture of N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;noradrenaline from the ketone precursor are studied through catalyst screening and computational evaluations. This reaction provides an efficient and industrially suitable method for the manufacture of enantiomerically pure noradrenaline, an important neurotransmitter which is widely used as a pharmacological substance due to its sympathomimetic properties.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrroloquinazolines present a plethora of biological or pharmacological activities, thus attracting the interest of several research groups on the development of new and efficient synthetic strategies for obtaining this class of N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds. In this Review, the progress on the greener synthesis of pyrroloquinazoline derivatives achieved in the last decade is discussed.







Abstract
Quinazoline derivatives draw attention from a synthetic and medicinal chemistry point of view, given the wide range of biological activities already described. This class of fused N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds has also shown its importance and potential pharmacological application. This Review covers the contributions reported in the last ten years for the synthesis of pyrroloquinazoline derivatives, focusing on greener protocols to obtain these adducts, such as multicomponent reactions, photocatalysis, microwaves, electrosynthesis among others.

         <title>Asymmetric Dual&#8208;State Emitters Featuring Thiazole Acceptors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a new series of thiazole&#8208;based dual&#8208;state emission fluorophores with self&#8208;isolation properties in solution and good emission in the solid state are reported.







Abstract
This work describes a new approach to construct highly conjugated molecules with asymmetric donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8217; architectures (D&#8722;A&#8722;D&#8217;). Five new emissive compounds featuring thiazole, a scarcely used acceptor, were synthesized using a three&#8208;component Rh(II) catalytic reaction. The asymmetric fluorescent compounds show significant emission in solution (QY=73&#8201;%&#8211;100&#8201;%) and the solid&#8208;state (QY=14&#8201;%&#8211;59&#8201;%), and therefore considered Dual&#8208;State Emitters (DSE). We also evaluate the impact of O&#8208;alkyl chains with varying lengths in the photophysical properties in solution, aggregates, and solid&#8208;state. Computational studies indicate that the involved electronic transitions have a significant charge transfer character produced almost exclusively from the triphenylamine donors. According to the single crystal X&#8208;ray data of compounds 8 and 9, the conjugated structures have a twisted molecular conformation that contributes to the observed emission in the solid&#8208;state. These findings show a systematic approach to design DSE materials, which may help to stimulate their use in biological or optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Polycyclic Quinazolinones through C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization of Inert Alkanes or Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Oxidation Decarboxylation of N&#8208;Hydroxyphthalimide Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the cleavage of the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond of inert alkanes and the visible&#8208;light promoted oxidation decarboxylation of NHP&#8208;esters to form alkyl radicals, which then efficiently synthesize valuable polycyclic quinazolinones through radical addition and cyclization. Both methods were carried out in water or water/DMSO media without metal catalysts with good functional group compatibility.







Abstract
Two novel C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of inert alkanes and visible&#8208;light promoted oxidation decarboxylation of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHP) esters to access polycyclic quinazolinones have been described. These methods do not involve metal catalysts and are carried out in water or water/DMSO media. The wide substrate scope, even including the seven&#8208;membered ring under mild reaction conditions, demonstrate the practicability of these strategies.

&lt;p&gt;This work describes the cleavage of the C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bond of inert alkanes and the visible-light promoted oxidation decarboxylation of NHP-esters to form alkyl radicals, which then efficiently synthesize valuable polycyclic quinazolinones through radical addition and cyclization. Both methods were carried out in water or water/DMSO media without metal catalysts with good functional group compatibility.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular iodine&#8208;catalysed efficient synthesis of C3&#8208;alkylated indoles was well established, which exhibits excellent functional group tolerance, mild conditions, and wide substrate scope. Notably, this environmental&#8208;friendly methodology also finds application in the late&#8208;stage modification of drug&#8208;like molecules.







Abstract
Herein, we report a molecular iodine&#8208;catalysed reductive alkylation of indoles with carbonyl compounds using Et3SiH for the efficient synthesis of C3&#8208;alkylated indoles. This metal&#8208;free and environmental&#8208;friendly process exhibits excellent functional group tolerance, mild conditions, and wide substrate scope. Notably, the synthetic usefulness of this strategy to pharmacochemistry was highlighted by the late&#8208;stage modification of drug&#8208;like molecules.

         <title>On the Mechanism of Halogen Atom Transfer from C&#8722;X Bonds to &#945;&#8208;Aminoalkyl Radicals: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive computational study of the Halogen Atom Transfer (XAT) mechanism is reported. Up to 32 &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical/organic halide combinations are explored to understand the effect of the C&#8722;X bond, the influence of &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical properties and the alkyl or aryl character of the reactive C center in the reactivity.







Abstract
Generation of carbon centered radicals from organic halides represents a powerful tool in modern organic chemistry, especially in the context of photoredox catalysis. However, activation of carbon&#8211;halogen bonds is usually promoted by toxic and hazardous tin reagents. Alternatively, &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals have emerged as a cheap and efficient halogen atom transfer (XAT) reagents, although the activation mechanism is still underexplored with respect to hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) chemistry. Herein, we report a computational systematic evaluation of four different &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals on the Halogen Atom Transfer (XAT) mechanism. We have evaluated up to 32&#8197;reactions, including two different types of substrates (Ph&#8722;X and Cy&#8722;X). This systematic study aims to provide a big picture on the key effects in this reactivity including the hybridization of carbon, the nature of the halogen, and the electronics/sterics of the &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical.

         <title>Synthetic Applications of Photocatalyzed Halogen&#8208;Radical Mediated Hydrogen Atom Transfer for C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalysis is a method of choice for the generation of reactive intermediates under mild conditions. This Review collects the recent examples exploiting this manifold to generate highly aggressive halogen radicals to activate C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds via Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) for synthetic purposes. Available strategies to influence site&#8208;selectivity of the hydrogen atom transfer step have also been discussed.







Abstract
The opportunity to activate C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds via homolytic cleavage by means of halogen radicals has long been disregarded in synthetic endeavors due to the unpredictable selectivity. Nowadays, photocatalysis has established itself as a method of choice for the generation of such reactive intermediates under mild conditions. This Minireview collects recent examples showcasing how photocatalytic manifolds have been used to tame aggressive halogen radicals to activate C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds via Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) for synthetic purposes. In the last section of this work, we address site&#8208;selectivity issues posed by this methodology and show how it can be guided through the judicious choice of reaction conditions.

         <title>Z&#8208;Selective Alkene Formation from Reductive Aldehyde Homo&#8208;Couplings</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presence of an electron&#8208;withdrawing group at the PIII of a phosphanyl phosphonate reagent MesFP(H)P(O)(OEt)2 (see Figure) renders the reductive aldehyde coupling of aldehydes selectively for the thermodynamically less stable Z&#8208;olefin product.







Abstract
Current methodologies for the direct reductive coupling of two aldehydes to alkenes afford almost exclusively the thermodynamically favoured E&#8208;isomer. Recent efforts to find phosphorus&#8208;based reagents as replacements for the low&#8208;valent Ti species in McMurry couplings present opportunities to change this shortcoming, and to design new reagents that allow for the formation of high proportions of Z&#8208;alkenes under kinetic control. Here, we report the first example of such a reagent, a phosphanyl phosphonate MesFP(H)P(O)(OEt)2, 6, with an electron&#8208;deficient MesF=2,4,6&#8208;(CF3)3Ph substituent that promotes the reductive homo&#8208;coupling of (hetero)aromatic aldehydes to alkenes with high Z&#8208;selectivity. Computational results indicate that the selectivity stems from the electron deficient MesF, which results in lowered activation barriers for the collapse of a cis&#8208;oxaphosphetane intermediate. In the absence of MesF, the E&#8208;isomer is exclusively observed experimentally. Directing the isomeric outcome of alkene formation by introducing electron withdrawing P&#8208;substituents bears resemblance to the Still&#8208;Gennari modification of the Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons reaction where perfluorinated ethoxy substituents in the former also lead to high proportions of the Z&#8208;isomer.

         <title>Bromide Oxidation: A Safe Strategy for Electrophilic Brominations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, an overview is given of chemical oxidants for the radical/electrophilic brominations starting from harmless bromide sources as an alternative for toxic molecular bromine. The characteristics of the active brominating species as well as plausible side reactions have been discussed.







Abstract
Bromination of organic substances is still an important reaction in modern synthetic chemistry. In view of the increasing demand for sustainable synthetic chemistry, oxidative bromination can play an important role to avoid the use of hazardous molecular bromine (Br2). In this review, a complete overview of the chemical oxidants will be provided which have been used for the electrophilic as well as radical brominations, starting from less hazardous bromide Br(&#8722;I); e.&#8201;g., HBr or a bromide salt, with a focus on the differences caused by the choice of oxidant.

&lt;p&gt;Bromination of organic substances is still an important reaction in modern synthetic chemistry. In view of the increasing demand for sustainable synthetic chemistry, oxidative bromination can play an important role to avoid the use of hazardous molecular bromine (Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). In this review, a complete overview of the chemical oxidants will be provided which have been used for the electrophilic as well as radical brominations, starting from less hazardous bromide Br(&#8722;I); e.&#8201;g., HBr or a bromide salt, with a focus on the differences caused by the choice of oxidant.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanistic Studies on the Epoxidation of Alkenes by Macrocyclic Manganese Porphyrin Catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion mobility mass spectrometry reveals that a manganese (III) porphyrin cage reacts with the oxidant iodosylbenzene to form an inside iodosylbenzene complex, which is converted into a manganese(V)oxo complex in which the oxo group is located inside the cage (left). It reacts within the cage with alkenes to form epoxides. When the cage is blocked by methyl groups the reaction with iodosylbenzene and the formation of the manganese(V)oxo complex occurs at the outside of the cage (right). Subsequent reaction with alkenes takes place at the outside.







Abstract
Macrocyclic metal porphyrin complexes can act as shape&#8208;selective catalysts mimicking the action of enzymes. To achieve enzyme&#8208;like reactivity, a mechanistic understanding of the reaction at the molecular level is needed. We report a mechanistic study of alkene epoxidation by the oxidant iodosylbenzene, mediated by an achiral and a chiral manganese(V)oxo porphyrin cage complex. Both complexes convert a great variety of alkenes into epoxides in yields varying between 20&#8211;88&#8201;%. We monitored the process of the formation of the manganese(V)oxo complexes by oxygen transfer from iodosylbenzene to manganese(III) complexes and their reactivity by ion mobility mass spectrometry. The results show that in the case of the achiral cage complex the initial iodosylbenzene adduct is formed on the inside of the cage and in the case of the chiral one on the outside of the cage. Its decomposition leads to a manganese complex with the oxo ligand on either the inside or outside of the cage. These experimental results are confirmed by DFT calculations. The oxo ligand on the outside of the cage reacts faster with a substrate molecule than the oxo ligand on the inside. The results indicate how the catalytic activity of the macrocyclic porphyrin complex can be tuned and explain why the chiral porphyrin complex does not catalyze the enantioselective epoxidation of alkenes.

         <title>Synthesis of 1,5&#8208;Disubstituted Tetrazole&#8722;Indolizine Bis&#8208;Heterocycles and Their Copper (II) Recognizing Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double one&#8208;pot process was used for the synthesis of a bis&#8208;heterocyclic system encompassing 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;3H&#8208;pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]indolizin&#8208;3&#8208;one and 1,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole moieties. These reactions proceeded under mild reaction conditions and were operationally simple. The photophysical properties of the synthetized bis&#8208;heterocycles were evaluated against copper (II) addition.







Abstract
A novel bis&#8208;heterocyclic system encompassing the 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;3H&#8208;pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]indolizin&#8208;3&#8208;one and 1,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole moieties was designed, synthesized, and evaluated as a Copper (II) recognizing agent. This was achieved by exploiting the optical characteristics of indolizine and the copper recognizing activity of tetrazoles. For the preparation of these compounds, a novel and simple synthetic strategy consisting in a double one&#8208;pot process involving four&#8208;step reactions was developed. The first process is a one&#8208;pot five component reaction by using propargylamine as a bifunctional reactant to access the key intermediate, the N&#8208;acylated tetrazole. Consequently, N&#8208;acylated tetrazole was subjected to a one&#8208;pot three component reaction, consisting in a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution followed of a domino process to afford the target compounds. The photophysical properties of the obtained bis&#8208;heterocycles were evaluated against copper (II) addition.

Abstract
1,3&#8208;dimethylbarbituric acid&#8208;H2O mediated liquid assisted mechanochemical route has been developed for the synthesis of a wide array of 5&#8208;aryl/spiro&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolidine&#8208;3&#8208;thiones, via in&#8197;situ generation of benzylidene/alkylidene barbiturates, followed by tandem, base&#8208;driven Michael addition reaction and rearrangement of the pyrimido[4,5&#8208;e][1,2,4]triazepine intermediate. The method is an application of mechanochemistry in organic synthesis. It is efficient, easy to follow and avoids the tedious steps of catalyst preparation and chromatographic separation. Moreover, the protocol is compared to &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221;, room temperature approach and the reaction mechanism has been revisited with the aid of experiments.

         <dc:description>
1,3&#8208;Oxazoldine chiral auxiliaries are a valuable tool for asymmetric synthesis, often leading to the exploration of new chemistry, due to their ease of synthesis and functionalization. This Review summarizes the advances in the field, with a focus on the synthesis of bioactive molecules.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Oxazolidines, derived from widely available enantiomerically pure 1,2&#8208;aminoalcohols, are versatile chiral auxiliaries for several key transformations, often serving as a platform for inquiries into new and complex reactivity. This Review focuses on the chemistry of N&#8208;acyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazolidines in which the stereoselective transformation is carried out on the N&#8208;acyl attached side chain of the molecule, covering reports from late 1980s to 2020 across several fields of asymmetric synthesis of bioactive molecules, and in particular of natural products.

         <title>Cooperative Tertiary Phosphine/Palladium Catalyzed Nucleophilic Allylation between Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Carbonates and Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nucleophilic allylation reaction between isatin&#8208;derived Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates and simple alkenes was developed via cooperative tertiary phosphine and palladium catalysis. The in&#8197;situ generated onium salts and &#951;1&#8208;allylpalladium species were finely assembled with exclusive linear selectivity, producing a spectrum of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
In this work, we report an unusual nucleophilic allylation reaction between isatin&#8208;derived Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates and simple alkenes synergistically catalyzed by tertiary phosphines and palladium complexes, through chemoselective assemblies of in&#8197;situ formed onium salts and &#951;1&#8208;allylpalladium species, respectively. A range of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles were easily constructed in moderate to good yields with exclusive linear regioselectivity. Moreover, a number of control and deuterium experiments have been conducted to elucidate the catalytic mechanism.

         <title>Efficient Asymmetric Synthesis of an A&#8208;Ring Synthon for Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Preparation of 1&#945;&#8208;Hydroxyvitamin D Metabolites and Analogs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient Lewis acid&#8208;assisted asymmetric carbonyl&#8208;ene reaction to set the 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxyl functionality of enol&#8208;triflate, precursor of the A&#8208;ring of the hormone calcitriol and its 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxyderivatives, is described.







Abstract
The secondary parallel hypercalcemic effects associated with the treatment of several hyperproliferative diseases with the natural hormone 1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) and/or known active vitamin D metabolites and analogs, demand the development of efficient and rapid methods for the preparation of vitamin D receptor (VDR) ligands as new selective and non&#8208;calcemic agonists. Here we describe an efficient and adaptable multigram&#8208;scale synthetic sequence to access an A&#8208;ring synthon as useful precursor of the vitamin D triene system of 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxylated vitamin D derivatives via Pd&#8208;catalyzed carbocyclization/Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions in a protic medium. The key step is an asymmetric Lewis acid&#8208;promoted carbonyl&#8208;ene reaction to a chiral glyosylate ester to establish the 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxyl group of 1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxyvitamin D3 and its derivatives.

         <title>Directed Crosslinking of RNA by Glutathione&#8208;Triggered PNA&#8208;Quinone&#8208;Methide&#8208;Conjugates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PNA conjugates of redox&#8208;labile quinone methide precursors can be activated by glutathione at concentrations typical for the cytosol. The quinone methide, an electrophilic short&#8208;lived intermediate, then reacts with nucleophiles. When the PNA part is hybridized with a complementary strand of RNA, directed alkylation of the nucleobases can form crosslinks in yields up to 71&#8201;%.







Abstract
Quinone methide precursors protected with alkyldithiomethyl groups have been synthesized and converted into PNA conjugates. Stable in the absence of reducing agents, the electrophilic quinone methide is released by glutathione in concentrations typical for the cytosol. Self&#8208;alkylation then occurs or crosslinking of RNA when hybridized with complementary strands. Fastest reactions are seen for the sterically least hindered compound.

         <dc:description>
Herein, palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed halogenation of 2&#8208;phenylquinazolines using N&#8208;halosuccinimides as halogen sources was described via C&#8722;H activation under mild reaction conditions. A series of halogen&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;arylquinazolines were synthesized through C&#8722;H functionalization.







Abstract
An efficient quinazoline&#8208;assisted ortho&#8208;halogenation of 2&#8208;arylquinazolines has been developed using N&#8208;halosuccinimides as halogen sources with Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation. No additional ligand and oxidant are required. This protocol is highly regioselective and applicable to a broad range of quinazoline substrates bearing different functional groups, giving yields of up to 98&#8201;%. The mechanism of the quinazoline ortho&#8208;halogenation was investigated by comprehensive experimentation.

         <title>The Chemistry of Cyclopropanes and New Insights into Organocatalyzed Asymmetric Cyclopropanation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main reactions carried out on cyclopropanes to transform them into several useful structures are presented in this Review. In addition, the main cyclopropanation methods are reviewed. Finally, different asymmetric organocatalytic syntheses of the last two decades until 2021 are presented.







Abstract
Cyclopropane structure has been the object of interest in multiple investigations due to its prevalence in different natural products. In addition, this structure has a particular reactivity, specifically the 1,1&#8208;cyclopropanedicarboxylate compounds, which act as acceptor&#8208;donor cyclopropanes. Its reactivity could be compared with that of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl, which undergoes conjugate addition reaction and depending on the nature of the nucleophile this can lead to a cycloaddition reaction. Therefore, cyclopropane can be transformed into several useful structures in organic synthesis. Different methods have been described to achieve cyclopropanes such as, Simmons&#8208;Smith reaction, decomposition of diazoalkanes and Michael&#8208;Initiated ring closure (MIRC). Due to the absence of metals, this last method has been applied to the asymmetric organocatalytic synthesis of cyclopropanes, where the substrates activation is through the imine&#8208;enamine intermediates formation or by hydrogen bonds. The asymmetric reaction consists of a domino reaction composed of a conjugate addition reaction and a cyclization reaction via intramolecular nucleophilic substitution. In this review, different asymmetric organocatalytic syntheses of the last two decades until 2021 are presented. With the intention to facilitate the reading of the review, an example of each paper was selected with the optimal reaction conditions and with the best organocatalyst producing the best yield and high stereoselectivity.

         <title>Heteroglycoclusters through Unprecedented Orthogonal Chemistry Based on N&#8208;Alkylation of N&#8208;Acylhydrazone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new orthogonal strategy involving the N&#8208;alkylation of N&#8208;acylhydrazone as a key step. When followed by azido&#8208;alkyne click chemistry, it represents a new and straightforward synthetic method to prepare N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;NAH glycoconjugates of small molecules, heterodisaccharides, and heteroglycoclusters&#8208;based on cone p&#8208;tBu&#8208;calix[4]arene and 1,3&#8208;alt p&#8208;tBu&#8208;thiacalix[4]arene with potential drug&#8208;like properties.







Abstract
Orthogonal chemistry is a valuable tool in the preparation of complex molecules as heteroglycoclusters. Unfortunately, selective heteroconjugation of multifunctional starting materials remains a usually challenging problem to overcome. Herein, we report the first report on harnessing N&#8208;alkylation of N&#8208;acylhydrazone as a key step in the orthogonal synthesis. Sequentially associated with the azido&#8208;alkyne click chemistry, it stands out as a new and straightforward synthetic method of glycoconjugate small molecules, heterodisaccharides, and heteroglycoclusters based on cone p&#8208;tBu&#8208;calix[4]arene and 1,3&#8208;alt p&#8208;tBu&#8208;thiacalix[4]arene with potential drug&#8208;like properties.

Based on SnCl2&#8208;catalyzed acetalation and selective benzoylation, a one&#8208;pot strategy to efficiently synthesize orthogonally protected glycosyl acceptors with 2&#8208;OH/3&#8208;OH was developed.

Consequently, 2&#8208;OBz or 3&#8208;OBz 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;benzylidene galactosides and glucosides were efficiently prepared in moderate to high yields starting from free galactosides and glucosides, and were used as valuable glycosyl acceptors for the synthesis of blood group antigens O and B analogues in this study.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H Arylation of Aryl Glycinamide Derivatives Using Picolinamide as Directing Group</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient protocol to access a set of arylated glycinamide derivatives through a C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H activation assisted by the directing group picolinamide and Pd(OAc)2 has been developed. The methodology has a high atom economy and broad substrate scope.







Abstract
A Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2/sp3)&#8722;H bond arylation protocol has been developed to access ortho&#8208;diaryl, ortho&#8208;mono&#8208;aryl, and biaryl&#8208;diarylmethane&#8208;glycinamide derivatives bearing picolinamide as directing group. Mechanistic details of the process have been obtained by computational modelling of the activation reaction through DFT calculations.

         <title>Crown&#8208;Ether&#8208;Based Cryptands with Rarely Strong Affinities for Binding Neutral Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8242;iterative approach&#8242; of delicately tunning the non&#8208;covalent interactions could be a powerful route to construct molecular hosts that exhibit high selectivity and affinity for guest molecules. Through tailoring spatial fitting and multi non&#8208;covalent interactions (especially H&#8208;bonding), cryptands with rarely strong affinities for binding neutral guest molecules were achieved.







Abstract
Herein, we present the syntheses of two new crown&#8208;ether&#8208;based cryptands and their complexation behaviors with neutral organic molecules. The interactions between 4/5 and G1/G2 were fast exchange systems forming pseudorotaxane&#8208;like complexes with a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometric ratio. The association constant (Ka) of &#8220;long&#8208;armed&#8221; cryptand 5 with G2 was even up to 2.5&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1, which is 10 to 103&#8197;times higher than the previously reported host&#8208;neutral guest system to the best of our knowledge. Such a large Ka is even comparable to that of reported cryptands with secondary ammonium salts and paraquat derivatives. Thorough studies demonstrated that excellent spatial fitting and multi non&#8208;covalent interactions (H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking) are essential for such a large Ka.

This study describes the synthesis of a heterotriptycene consisting of an unsubstituted bispyrrole from a novel Diels&#8208;Alder reaction active benzobicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. The resulting molecule formed a 2D&#8208;hexagonal array in crystalline state.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis, crystal structure, and optical properties of a heterotriptycene consisting of an unsubstituted bispyrrole, 2,4,6,8&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;4,8&#8208;benzobenzo[1,2&#8208;c:4,5&#8208;c&#8242;]dipyrrole, which was synthesized via hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of a novel benzobicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. The compound formed a 2D nested hexagonal array with NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions in the crystalline state; whereas, in the solution state, it exhibited through&#8208;space intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) induced emission in the solution state.
