         <title>Effects of a Larger N&#8208;Heterocyclic Ring in Rofecoxib Analogues on AIE Activity and Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two analogues of rofecoxib, 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF and 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF, were designed according to the strategy of heterocyclic ring enlargement and facilely synthesized in a facile manner by Knoevenagel reactions. The first compound, 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF, had low quantum yields (QY) of 3.0% in the solid states. After replacing the pyrrolidinyl with piperidinyl, the resulting 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF had a significantly increased QY, with a value of 28%. The root&#8208;mean&#8208;square deviation (RMSD) values between S0 and S1 of 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF and 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF in tetrahydrofuran were 0.51, 0.35 &#197;, respectively. As compared with 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF, compound 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF exhibits a smaller RMSD, which indicates a lower non&#8208;radiative transition rate. A single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study and Hirshfeld surfaces analysis revealed that 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF had a more nonplanar molecule structure and a weaker &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction, which might result in a higher fluorescence intensity and QY. Owing to its better aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior, compound 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF showed more multi&#8208;functional applications, including mechanochromism, acidochromism, and lipid droplets imaging ability. These results imply that the strategy of heterocyclic ring enlargement provides a new paradigm for the design of new luminogens with AIE properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalyzed Asymmetric Michael Addition of 4&#8208;Monosubstituted&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones to Enones: Construction of Vicinal Quaternary and Tertiary Stereocenters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyrazolone moiety bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereogenic center is frequent in biologically active products and pharmaceuticals. The catalytic route for the construction of a quaternary carbon center possesses challenges. In this report, catalytic asymmetric Michael addition of 4&#8208;monosubstituted&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones to simple enones catalysed by primary amine&#8208;Br&#248;nsted acid composite has been developed. An array of pyrazolone derivatives bearing vicinal all carbon quaternary and tertiary stereocenters, were obtained in moderate to good diastereoselectivities (up to 92:8 dr) and good to excellent enantiomeric excess (up to 99% ee). In addition, antipode for enantiomers of the pyrazolone derivatives were also be realized in good to high stereoselectivities (up to 92:8 dr and up to 98% ee).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A photo&#8208;induced Minisci&#8211;type cyanoalkylation of azauracils was developed under metal&#8208;free and base&#8208;free conditions. Readily available cyclobutanone oxime esters were used as the cyanoalkylating reagents via C&#8208;C bond cleavage to generate the &#947;&#8208;cyanoalkyl azauracil derivatives in good to moderate yields. The introduced cyano group can be easily converted into many other functional groups, thus makes current protocol more practical.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigations on Superbase Mediated Reactivity of N&#8208;Tosylhydrazones with Aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;Quinone Methide Precursors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have encountered a superbase&#8208;mediated chemoselective reaction of N&#8208;tosylhydrazones with aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide precursors. When tosylhydrazone was treated with ortho&#8208;aminobenzyl alcohol in super basic conditions (KOH+DMSO), we observed the formation of&#160; &#160;2&#8208;substituted quinoline. The reaction was found to be general, and by this method, mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted quinolines could be made. We could prove experimentally and theoretically that the reaction proceeded via the formation of&#160;an azine from the basic decomposition of N&#8208;tosylhydrazones. Finally, the reaction of tosylhydrazone with N&#8208;(2&#8208;(chloromethyl)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; phenyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylbenzenesulfonamide (aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide precursor) under super basic conditions afforded hydrazine substituted sulfonamides.</dc:description>

         <title>Cp2Fe&#8208;Mediated Electrochemical Synthesis of Functionalized Compounds: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on Cp2Fe&#8208;mediated electrosynthesis of diverse functionalized compounds with the newly formed C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C, C&#8722;P, and C&#8722;O bonds over the past decade.







Abstract
Unlike traditional organic methods, electrosynthesis has emerged as an environmentally friendly and sustainable approach to generate a series of functionalized compounds. In this process, the traceless electron serves as the redox agent, eliminating the need for stoichiometric oxidants or reductants. In contrast to direct electrolysis, redox&#8208;mediated electrolysis has the ability to overcome kinetic inhibitions and achieve diverse selectivity under mild conditions. This has garnered increasing attention from the synthetic community, especially in the past few years. This review will focus on Cp2Fe&#8208;mediated electrosynthesis of diversified functionalized compounds through C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C, C&#8722;P and C&#8722;O bond formation over the past decade.

         <title>Selective Transformation of 1,3&#8208;Cyclooctadiene into Novel Functionalized Azaheterocycles, &#946;&#8208;Amino Esters, and Lactams by Means of Ring&#8208;Rearrangement Metathesis</title>

Diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of some novel functionalized azaheterocyclic &#946;&#8208;amino esters with multiple chiral centers from 1,3&#8208;cyclooctadiene&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;amino acids has been accomplished through stereocontrolled metathesis protocols.







Abstract
Diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of some novel functionalized azaheterocyclic &#946;&#8208;amino esters with multiple chiral centers from 1,3&#8208;cyclooctadiene&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;amino acids through a stereocontrolled synthetic route has been accomplished. The strategy was based on the creation of some novel unsaturated N&#8208;protected cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino esters from 1,3&#8208;cyclooctadiene. Products were subjected to ring&#8208;opening metathesis (ROM) followed by selective ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM). A comparative investigation on the selectivity, regarding the catalysts, yields, conversions, and substrate directing effect on ring&#8208;rearrangement metathesis (RRM) transformation has been accomplished. Importantly, the procedure used in this synthetic process does not affect the configuration of the chiral centers. The pathway takes place across conservation of the configurations of the stereocenters; therefore, the architectural skeleton of the starting cyclooctene&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;amino acids predetermined the structure of the new azaheterocyclic systems.

Products were subjected to ring-opening metathesis (ROM) followed by selective ring-closing metathesis (RCM). A comparative investigation on the selectivity, regarding the catalysts, yields, conversions, and substrate directing effect on ring-rearrangement metathesis (RRM) transformation has been accomplished. Importantly, the procedure used in this synthetic process does not affect the configuration of the chiral centers. The pathway takes place across conservation of the configurations of the stereocenters; therefore, the architectural skeleton of the starting cyclooctene-based &#946;-amino acids predetermined the structure of the new azaheterocyclic systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nitrile Furanics via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydration of Aldoximes and Knoevenagel Condensation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrile furanic compounds have been prepared employing two simple synthetic approaches; i) dehydration of aldoximes and ii) Knoevenagel condensation. Both methodologies were firstly tested and optimized on furfural and thus exploited on 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furfural (HMF) and 5,5&#8217;&#8208;oxy(bismethylene)&#8208;2&#8208;furaldehyde (OBMF). All the resulting products were achieved in good to excellent yield and isolated as pure employing simple purification procedure.







Abstract
In this work two synthetic approaches to introduce nitrile moieties into bio&#8208;based derived furanic compounds were investigated, i.&#8201;e., dehydration of aldoximes and Knoevenagel condensation. Both methodologies have been first tested and optimized on furfural and thus exploited on 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furfural (HMF) and 5,5&#8217;&#8208;oxy(bismethylene)&#8208;2&#8208;furaldehyde (OBMF). The syntheses of furfural, HMF and OBMF aldoximes were efficiently conducted (also in large scale) under mild reaction conditions and short reaction time. The subsequent dehydration to nitrile furanic compounds was carried out in the presence of catalytic amount of copper acetate monohydrate. Furthermore, Knoevenagel condensations were performed on furfural, HMF and OBMF with different Activated Methylene Group compounds, using for the first&#8208;time dimethyl carbonate as the reaction media. Most of the resulting products were isolated as pure via simple liquid&#8208;liquid extraction in good to excellent yields. Future applications of these compounds might include aldoxime reduction into amine furanics &#8208; herein also preliminary investigated &#8208; and hydrolysis of the nitrile derivatives in the related carboxylic acid (or ester) furanics. All these products are interesting monomers for the preparation of bio&#8208;based polymers.

Abstract
The treatment of diethyl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydroaminophosphonate&#8197;1 with various arenes (ArH=toluene 2&#8201;a, benzene 2&#8201;b, anisole 2&#8201;c, bromobenzene 2&#8201;d, chlorobenzene 2&#8201;e, benzyl alcohol 2&#8201;f, p&#8208;xylene 2&#8201;g) in acetic acid (AcOH) at 120&#8201;&#176;C for 8&#8197;h in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 (10&#8201;%&#8201;mol, OAc=acetate) and AgOAc (3.4&#8197;equivalents) results in the formation of the corresponding &#946;&#8208;aryl derivatives E&#8208;Ar(H)C=C(NHAc)P(O)(OEt)2 3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;g. The reaction proceeds through double C&#8722;H activation (arene and alkene) and subsequent C&#8722;C oxidative coupling (Fujiwara&#8211;Moritani reaction), processes catalyzed by Pd and assisted by Ag. The obtained products 3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;g are isosteric analogs of phenylalanine and are obtained with high selectivity. Thus, geometrical E&#8208;isomers have been obtained in all studied cases, however mixtures of ortho&#8208;/meta&#8208;/para&#8208;isomers are observed when the activated position in the starting arene 2 is considered.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Synthesis Applied to Optoelectronic and Energy Materials: Design, Applications and Limitations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic Covalent Chemistry, consisting in the use of dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) to create complex objects by working at the thermodynamic equilibrium, has undeniable advantages for the preparation of conjugated systems with tailored optoelectronic properties for organic electronics. Chemists can combine simple building blocks with simple functional groups of appropriate geometry, structure and stoichiometry to build multidimensional conjugated architectures. Dynamic covalent reactions are often precious metal&#8208;free, generate little to no side products and are very efficient. DCBs however afford sensitive materials, and consequently a balance needs to be found between the ease of synthesis, the stability and the performances. The dynamicity of the target materials hence can considerably reduce their applicability in organic electronics where strongly stable materials are needed, but opens the door to stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviour and recyclability. A way to overcome dynamicity issues is to lock DCBs, but often at the cost of decreased conjugation. In this review, we will highlight how DCBs are employed to prepare functional optoelectronically active materials, such as discrete molecules, polymers or covalent organic frameworks, applied in fields ranging from organic light&#8208;emitting diodes and solar cells to organic batteries and transistors. We will also discuss their limitations, benefits and&#160; current challenges to overcome.</dc:description>

It is worth highlighting that the recycling and incorporation of the waste carbonyl byproduct, generated in the reduction step, into the final compound is realized.

         <title>Synthesis, Structures, Electrochemical and Optical Properties of Vinyl&#8208;Extended Tetrathiafulvalene Derivatives Functionalized with Two 2,6&#8208;Dicyano&#8208;&#955;5&#8208;Phosphinine Units</title>

Derivatives of vinyl&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene functionalized two 2,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;&#955;5&#8208;phosphinine units have been successfully synthesized, and characterized by X&#8208;ray structural analyses, cyclic voltammetry, absorption, and emission spectroscopies.







Abstract
Derivatives of vinyl&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) functionalized with two 2,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;&#955;5&#8208;phosphinine units (3&#8201;a&#8211;c) have been successfully synthesized. Cyclic voltammograms of all the derivatives are composed of three pairs of redox waves. The first and second redox waves correspond to one&#8208;electron transfer processes, in which the extended TTF moiety participated predominantly. The third redox wave corresponded to a two&#8208;electron transfer process, in which the two 2,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;&#955;5&#8208;phosphinine units were involved. The redox potentials at which the tetracations of 3&#8201;a&#8211;c were generated were considerably more negative than expected, probably due to the formation of stable closed&#8208;shell structures by conjugation between 2,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;&#955;5&#8208;phosphinine units. X&#8208;ray structural analyses of 3&#8201;b, 3&#8201;c, and (3b2+)(Sb2Cl82&#8722;)(C6H5OCH3) revealed that the vinyl&#8208;extended TTF moiety in all the compounds adopts an almost planar structure, while the phosphinine units are significantly rotated relative to the extended TTF plane. The fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the emission intensity of 3&#8201;b was very small in both the neutral and oxidized states.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives of vinyl-extended tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) functionalized with two 2,6-dicyano-&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-phosphinine units (&lt;b&gt;3&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt;) have been successfully synthesized. Cyclic voltammograms of all the derivatives are composed of three pairs of redox waves. The first and second redox waves correspond to one-electron transfer processes, in which the extended TTF moiety participated predominantly. The third redox wave corresponded to a two-electron transfer process, in which the two 2,6-dicyano-&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-phosphinine units were involved. The redox potentials at which the tetracations of &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt; were generated were considerably more negative than expected, probably due to the formation of stable closed-shell structures by conjugation between 2,6-dicyano-&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-phosphinine units. X-ray structural analyses of &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt;, and (&lt;b&gt;3b&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;)(Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;)(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) revealed that the vinyl-extended TTF moiety in all the compounds adopts an almost planar structure, while the phosphinine units are significantly rotated relative to the extended TTF plane. The fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the emission intensity of &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; was very small in both the neutral and oxidized states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a new application of fluorosulfonylazide (FSO2N3) for diazotizing a series of activated methylene compounds to deliver the corresponding diazo products. Notably, by the judicious choice of bases, the selective generation of the Bestmann&#8208;Ohira reagent (BOR) or the Seyferth&#8722;Gilbert reagent (SGR) has been realized from FSO2N3 and dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxopropylphosphonate. We also investigated the kinetics of the homologation of aldehydes using these two reagents with K2CO3 as a base in MeOH, finding that a faster reaction rate was achieved by using SGR. Moreover, the facile one&#8208;pot synthesis of terminal alkynes from aldehydes has been established, which could be further coupled with azides to deliver triazoles using CuAAC click chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzocoumarin&#8208;Fused Triskelions Exhibit AIEE Due to Inhibited Molecular Inversion</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triskelion&#8208;shaped AIEgens consisting of benzo[f], [g], and [h]coumarin units (2F, 2G, and 2H) were successfully synthesized through the intramolecular Ullmann coupling. These compounds adopt unique &#960;&#8208;twisted helical geometries because of the fusion mode of the benzocoumarins, and the structural isomers have different molecular thicknesses and planarities. These compounds demonstrate remarkable AIEE behaviour in the aggregated states because molecular inversion is suppressed.







Abstract
Developing aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) is a unique strategy for alleviating concentration quenching of &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic compounds. This AIE behaviour can be induced not only in organic dyes with rotors but also in invertible &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. Herein, intramolecular Ullmann coupling was used to synthesize &#960;&#8208;twisted triskelion&#8208;shaped AIEgens (2F, 2G, and 2H), in which benzo[f], [g], and [h] coumarins were fused into the benzene core to form a helical propeller shape. These structural isomers had unique molecular thicknesses and planarities depending on the fusion mode of the benzocoumarin. The racemic crystals, PPP and MMM, had different overlapping molecular configurations because of their twisted molecular frameworks. Compounds&#8197;2F, 2G and 2H demonstrated weak fluorescence emission in diluted solutions resulting from molecular motions caused by the isomerization process during molecular inversion. By comparison, aggregates exhibited enhanced emission intensity. These &#960;&#8208;twisted triskelions exhibited the characteristics of AIEgens.

         <dc:description>A concise set of 4&#8208;substituted pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine carboriboside analogues was synthesized in a divergent fashion through a central intermediate. An oxaziridine reagent allowed to synthesize a crucial hydrazine glycon intermediate, which was transformed via a base build&#8208;up strategy to the desired intermediate using a commercially available pyrimidine building block. Reaction with a variety of nucleophiles allowed late&#8208;stage diversification. All analogues were evaluated for activity against a representative panel of Trypanosomatida. A methoxy&#8208;substituted analogue displayed single&#8208;digit micromolar activity against two subspecies of Trypanosoma brucei in cellular assays.</dc:description>

Borrowing hydrogen (BH) has reached a wide attention from the chemistry community as a new opportunity to construct efficiently C&#8722;N bond (as well as C&#8722;C or C&#8722;S bond). This straightforward strategy is usually supported by relevant organometallic catalysts, involved in the dehydrogenation&#8208;reduction processes. This concept highlights specifically the application of the borrowing hydrogen to the preparation of saturated aza&#8208;heterocycles (piperidines, pyrrolidines and piperazines) extensively present in high&#8208;added value molecules of pharmaceutical industry over the last 40&#8197;years using homogenous catalysis in particular. A focus will be given to the appropriate metals (Ru, Ir and more recently earth&#8208;abundant metals) used for this transformation. An extension to chiral induction in order to prepare enantiopure N&#8208;heterocycles will be also reported.

         <title>Two Synthesis Approaches of the 2H&#8208;Tetrahydro&#8208;4,6&#8208;dioxo&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazine Ring System of Alchivemycins A and B</title>

The 2H&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;4,6&#8208;dioxo&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazine (TDO) ring model of alchivemycins, an unprecedented structural motif in natural products, was synthesized via two routes. Both routes involved the intramolecular trapping of an acylketene intermediate by an internal hydroxy group as a key step. A DMAP&#8722;CaCl2&#8208;mediated O&#8208; to C&#8208;acyl migration reaction enabled installation of an acyl group at the C5 position of an unstable TDO intermediate.







Abstract
The 2H&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;4,6&#8208;dioxo&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazine (TDO) ring, a rare structural motif embedded in the molecular architecture of alchivemycins, is synthesized from 2,2,6&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxin&#8208;4&#8208;one via two routes. Both routes involve the intramolecular trapping of an acylketene intermediate by an internal hydroxy group to form the TDO ring as a key step. The first synthesis was achieved in 29&#8201;% overall yield from the starting material by a four&#8208;step sequence featuring a DMAP&#8722;CaCl2&#8208;mediated O&#8208; to C&#8208;acyl migration reaction to install an acyl group at the C5 position of the TDO ring. The second synthesis was completed in 8&#8201;% overall yield from the same starting material as the first one through five steps by exploiting a photo&#8208;induced double bromination reaction.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Annulation&#8211;Iodosulfonylation of Indole&#8208;Tethered 1,6&#8208;Enynes to Access Pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 10, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indole tethered 1,6&#8208;enynes were designed and prepared for the first time and then used to achieve an electrochemical annulation&#8208;iodosulfonylation reaction. The reaction of indole&#8208;tethered 1,6&#8208;enynes with arylsulfonyl hydrazide and KI led to unprecedented iodosulfonated pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoles in moderate to high yields under sustainable electrochemical oxidative conditions, which may open new avenues for the formation of pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoles.







Abstract
We present the first example of electrocatalytic three&#8208;component annulation&#8211;iodosulfonylation of indole&#8208;tethered 1,6&#8208;enynes with arylsulfonyl hydrazides and KI for accessing various iodosulfonated pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoles in moderate to excellent yields with high stereospecificity. This electrosynthesis opens new avenues for the construction of pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoles skeleton with good functional group compatibility under environmentally benign condition. Based on the control experiments and cyclic voltammetry data, we suggested the plausible reaction mechanism which included anodic oxidation, homolysis of arylsulfonyl iodide, arylsulfonyl radical addition, 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization, radical coupling or nucleophilic attack of iodide ions cascade.

         <title>Chemical Recycling of Polycarbonates via Ammonolysis and Polycaprolactones by KOH&#8208;Catalyzed Methanolysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 10, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple chemical method for the depolymerization of two polyesters namely, poly(bisphenol A carbonate) and poly (&#1013;&#8208;caprolactone) has been developed. The reaction conditions are devoid of any heavy metal catalysts and simple to perform at large scale.







Abstract
Chemical recycling polymer waste is a highly required technology to follow the current carbon&#8208;neutral trend. Here, we present practical recycling methods for poly (bisphenol A carbonate) (PC) and poly(&#1013;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL). PC can be converted to bisphenol A and urea with excellent product yield at 80&#8201;&#176;C via ammonolysis using ammonium salt (ammonium&#8208;formate or &#8208;carbonate) instead of liquid ammonia that is usually used in previous PC recycling. PCL can be converted to methyl 6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;hexanoate monomer with excellent yield at 80&#8201;&#176;C via methanolysis catalyzed by KOH.

         <title>Library Synthesis of Cyclobutanol Derivatives by Hyperbaric [2+2] Cycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 10, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclobutanes have garnered increased attention in medicinal chemistry because of their distinctive puckered structure, sp3 richness, and rigidity, offering potential advantages in pharmacological properties. In this study a two&#8208;diversification&#8208;point library of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;[(arenesulfonyl)methyl]cyclobutanols was synthesized through a hyperbaric [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between sulfonyl allenes and benzyl vinyl ether as the key step.







Abstract
Cyclobutanes are attracting a growing interest in medicinal chemistry because of their unique structure and potentially advantageous pharmacological properties. Specifically, 1,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutanes have been explored as conformationally restricted propyl isosteres in drug development. In this study, a concise two&#8208;diversification&#8208;point library of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;[(arenesulfonyl)methyl]cyclobutanols was synthesized through a hyperbaric [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between sulfonyl allenes and benzyl vinyl ether as the key step. Three different sulfonyl allenes were used for synthesizing the core structures that were further derivatized by the addition of up to seven amines. The amino groups were incorporated in a moderate to excellent diastereoselectivity through conjugate addition to the four&#8208;membered&#8208;ring scaffolds. Overall, this synthesis process demonstrates the potential for further chemical expansion and fragment growth in drug development.

         <title>PTSA&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2] Cycloaddition of in Situ Generated 3&#8208;Ylidene Oxindoles with Coumarin&#8208;Based N&#8208;Phenyl Enamine Derivatives</title>

         <dc:description>
Oxindole&#8208;bearing pyrrolocoumarin frameworks were synthesized from 3&#8208;ylidene oxindoles that were generated in&#8197;situ and coumarin&#8208;based N&#8208;phenyl enamines. The products were isolated in high yields by simple filtration. The results from variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies and DFT calculations supported the observed formation of rotamers.







Abstract
Br&#248;nsted acid mediated [3+2] cycloaddition of coumarin&#8208;based enamines with 3&#8208;ylidene oxindoles generated in&#8197;situ from 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;aroylmethyl oxindoles enabled the synthesis of polyheterocyclic compounds with a pyrrolocoumarin core structure in a highly regioselective manner. The synthetic procedure is highly efficient and metal&#8208;free, and no chromatographic purification of the products is required. The chromenopyrrole derivatives bearing an oxindole moiety formed as rapidly interconverting rotamers.

         <title>Bispidine&#8208;Based S,N&#8208;Chiral Ligands for Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Arylation of Cyclic N&#8208;Sulfonyl Ketimines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 10, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new, prepare simple and stable bispidine&#8208;based S,N&#8208;chiral ligand was designed, complexing with Pd, to efficiently promote the asymmetric addition of arylboric acids to cyclic N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines. The structure determination of ligand and ligand/PdCl2 catalyst, together with DFT calculations, clarify the origin of enantioselectivity as well as the reason of alkyl group on ligand affecting the stereoselectivity significantly.







Abstract
Development of new chiral ligands is essentially important in the field of asymmetric metal catalysis. Bispidines, steming from natural alkaloids, represent an intriguing yet underexplored class of chiral ligands. In this article, we developed a series of bispidine&#8208;based chiral ligands with chirality locked in the side chain, and explore their properties by applying in the palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric addition of arylboric acids to cyclic N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines. A S,N&#8208;bispidine ligand was found especially efficient, affording a series of chiral benzosultams with a quaternary chiral center in excellent yields with excellent ee values. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and crystal structure of catalyst helped to propose a reasonable mechanism including a possible transition state model to explain the origin of stereoselectivity.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Aryl Esters Involving Difluorocarbene Transfer Carbonylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 10, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective approach of Pd&#8208;catalyzed aryl halides, phenols to access of aryl esters is developed by difluorocarbene as a carbonyl source. This enables the three&#8208;component reaction to be formed directly one C&#8722;O, one C=O and one C&#8722;C bonds in a one&#8208;pot, one&#8208;step reaction, without extra separating and purifying the intermediate product.







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component intermolecular reaction between aryl halides, ClCF2COONa and phenols is developed. A series of aryl benzoates were synthesized in up to 84&#8201;% yield via difluorocarbene transfer carbonylation. It is devoted to acquiring the targeted products by construction of new C&#8722;C, C=O and C&#8722;O bonds in a one&#8208;pot, one&#8208;step process. The feature of this method includes the use of readily available starting materials, showing outstanding resistance to spatial obstruction and simple operation procedure with mild reaction conditions. Therefore, this makes the methodology a useful alternative to other schemes typically used for the synthesis of aryl esters.

         <title>Investigation into a Tetrahydroquinazoline Scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 10, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quinazoline derivatives with four points of diversification were prepared from &#946;&#8208;oxoesters obtained from ethyl acrylate and a nitroalkane. It was condensed with amidinium chlorides and further elaborated with primary amines (X=NH) or aryl mercaptans (X=S) and carboxylic acids RD&#8722;CO2H.







Abstract
A new 5,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydroquinazoline (i.&#8201;e. 1,3&#8208;diazanaphthalene) scaffold with four points of diversification RA&#8722;RD was prepared. The sequence started from nitroalkanes RCCH2NO2 (with RC = Me, Bu), ethyl acrylate and amidines RAC(NH)NH2 (with RA = Ph, 4&#8208;pyridyl) which were converted in a conjugate addition, Dieckmann condensation and pyrimidine ring formation. After transformation of the OH group in 4&#8208;position to a chloro leaving group, residues RB were introduced by nucleophilic substitution with alkyl amines RBNH2 (10 examples) or aryl thiols RBSH (two examples). Finally, the nitro group in the 6&#8208;position was reduced and the primary amino function amidated with various carboxylic acids RDCO2H. Along this seven&#8208;step sequence, eight examples of the fully decorated scaffold were prepared.

Abstract
&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated compounds are one of the most important functional compounds. Due to their unique property and versatile utility, they usually occur as the key intermediates for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and biological materials. Thus, their synthesis has attracted more attentions than before. The early approaches to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated compounds are mainly about transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free methods, such as halogenation&#8208;dehydrohalogenation methods and strong oxidants methods (organosulfur, organoselenium, benzoquinone). Subsequently, palladium and the other transition&#8208;metals catalyzed dehydrogenation of carbonyl compounds appeared respectively. In this review, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydrogenation is discussed, which is categorized by functional groups.

         <title>Synthesis and Applications of Benzothienobenzofurans: A Review</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 10, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review analyses all the synthetic methodologies reported for the preparation of the four isomers of benzothienobenzofuran and examines the generality of each method by highlighting its advantages and disadvantages and delves on available mechanistic postulates.







Abstract
Heteroacenes are considered as an important class of compounds for material applications due to their stability, electron&#8208;richness and tunable properties. Mostly, four ring containing heteroacenes have found immense applications in organic electronic devices and some of them have been successfully commercialized. One such class of heteroacene are benzothienobenzofuran for which four different isomers are reported to date based on the position where the benzothiophene unit is fused to the benzofuran ring. The available literature claims different synthetic strategies towards the benzothienobenzofurans starting from multistep synthesis to tandem transformations, electrochemical synthesis and annulations. Different metal catalyzed transformations including Pd&#8208;catalyzed dual C&#8722;H activations, Ullmann coupling, dual metal&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot processes etc. are reported for the synthesis of different isomers of benzothienobenzofurans. The present review analyses all the synthetic methodologies reported for the preparation of the four isomers and examines the generality of each method by highlighting its advantages and disadvantages. We discuss all available mechanisms of the reactions for the benefit of the readers. Finally, the existing basic photophysical properties of benzothienobenzofurans and their limited applications in fabricating devices for organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED), organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET), and organic phototransistor (OPT) uses are deliberated

         <title>Thiophane&#8208;Catalyzed Umpolung of N&#8208;Bromoimides for Dibromination of Olefins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a thiophane&#8208;catalyzed dibromination of olefins using NBS as the sole bromine source, wherein a new type of catalytic umpolung strategy of N&#8208;bromoimides is revealed. The mechanistic investigation revealed that in&#8197;situ generated 2,3&#8208;dihydrothiophene was the actual catalyst, which was responsible for the catalytic umpolung of NBS.







Abstract
A thiophane&#8208;catalyzed dibromination of olefins using NBS as the sole bromine source has been developed, providing a low&#8208;cost and mild methodology for preparing vicinally dibrominated compounds from electron&#8208;neutral or &#8208;deficient alkenes. The mechanistic investigation showed that 2,3&#8208;dihydrothiophene generated in&#8197;situ from the reaction of thiophane with NBS was the actual catalyst, which reversed the polarity of NBS to yield bromide ion.

         <title>Simple and Efficient Method for Mono&#8208; and Di&#8208;Amination of Polypyridine N&#8208;Oxides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical and convenient one&#8211;pot procedure for reductive ortho&#8211;amination of pyridyl N&#8208;oxides is described, using potassium phthalimide and tosyl chloride followed by hydrolysis. The scope and applicability of the reaction was demonstrated, providing various mono&#8208; and di&#8208;aminated products in moderate to excellent yields.







Abstract
Herein we report a simple synthetic route towards both known and novel aminated polypyridyl ligands. The use of tosyl chloride in combination with potassium phthalimide followed by hydrolysis allows for chemo&#8211;selective ortho&#8211;amination of (poly)pyridyl mono&#8208; and di&#8208;N&#8208;oxides with good to excellent yield. The reactions are scalable and reproducible while using inexpensive, commercially available reagents.

&lt;p&gt;A practical and convenient one&#8211;pot procedure for reductive &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;amination of pyridyl &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxides is described, using potassium phthalimide and tosyl chloride followed by hydrolysis. The scope and applicability of the reaction was demonstrated, providing various mono- and di-aminated products in moderate to excellent yields.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein we report a simple synthetic route towards both known and novel aminated polypyridyl ligands. The use of tosyl chloride in combination with potassium phthalimide followed by hydrolysis allows for chemo&#8211;selective &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;amination of (poly)pyridyl mono- and di-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxides with good to excellent yield. The reactions are scalable and reproducible while using inexpensive, commercially available reagents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formyl C&#8208;H thiolation of aldehydes using thiosulfonates using the decatungstate anion as a photocatalyst is reported. Using this photocatalytic protocol, both aromatic and aliphatic thioesters can be synthesized in good yields. The transformation consists of a cascade of double SH2 reactions, HAT and an ArS group transfer, and the yields are improved when the reaction is carried out in a CO atmosphere, which serves to limit the extent of decarbonylation acyl radicals that are generated in the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Substrate Scope of Dimethylsulfonium Propionate Lyases toward Dimethylsulfoxonium Propionate Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The six dimethylsulfonium propionate (DMSP) lyases DddQ, DddW, DddP, DddY, DddK and DddL catalyze the elimination of dimethyl sulfide from DMSP and can also cleave the marine metabolite dimethylsulfoxonium propionate (DMSOP) to DMSO and acrylate. In this study the potency of all six enzymes for the conversion of four DMSOP analogs with longer alkyl chains that were synthesized in three steps from 3&#8208;mercaptopropionic acid was investigated. For this purpose, the pH dependency of the enzyme reactions was determined, showing optimal conditions at pH 8 for all enzymes but DddP, for which an optimum of pH 6 was found. Efficient transformations were observed for DddQ, DddW, DddY and DddK, for which the Michaelis&#8208;Menten kinetics were determined for all four substrate analogs. HPLC analysis of the dialkylsulfoxides obtained with the most efficient enzyme DddW revealed that these compounds were obtained with a low to moderate enantiomeric excess (up to 25% ee), demonstrating that this enzyme has a preference for one of the enantiomers of the DMSOP analogs.</dc:description>

         <title>Unsymmetrical Anthracene Platforms as Singlet Oxygen Batteries: Effects of Substituents on Photooxygenation and Endoperoxide Thermolysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsymmetrical anthracene derivatives have been synthetized and demonstrated a good ability to capture, store and release singlet oxygen (1O2). Kinetic studies performed by UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy revealed the influence of the substituents on the photooxygenation and the thermal cycloreversion steps. These derivatives appeared as promising 1O2 batteries for dark photooxygenation.







Abstract
Aromatic architectures able to capture, store and release singlet oxygen have sparked the interest of the scientific community as an attractive strategy to generate singlet oxygen. Among these structures, anthracenes are efficient singlet oxygen batteries with applications in various fields such as chemistry, materials science or medicine. Until now, studies have mainly focused on symmetrical 9,10&#8208;disubstituted anthracenes bearing (hetero)aryl groups or substituted alkyne motifs. In this work, we investigated unsymmetrical anthracene molecules to explore their propensity to trap and to release singlet oxygen. Kinetic studies confirmed the impact of electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient substituents on the photooxygenation step and on the release of singlet oxygen triggered by thermolysis of the endoperoxides.

         <dc:description>A selective, mild, convenient, and green protocol for the preparation of S&#8208;acyl and N&#8208;acyl glutathiones is described involving the chemical modification of glutathione (GSH) with N&#8208;acyl imidazoles at room temperature in water. The syntheses of S&#8208;acyl glutathiones were achieved in very high yields using 1 equiv of an N&#8208;acyl imidazole in water at room temperature, without the need of a base. Double acylation of GSH with various N&#8208;acyl imidazoles in weakly basic aqueous media in the presence of N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (HOSu) as the activating reagent followed by selective deprotection of the S&#8208;acyl group with aqueous ammonia at room temperature gave high yields of N&#8208;acyl glutathiones. Moreover, the reaction could accommodate a diverse range of carboxylic acids such as (hetero)benzoic acids, phenylacetic acids, aliphatic acids from short&#8208;chain fatty acids (including acetic acid), long&#8208;chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, secondary or tertiary amino acids, and carboxylic acids containing clickable functional groups, fluorescent probes, or drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Boron Complexes of Tridentate Acyl Pyridylhydrazones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of boron complexes of tridentate acyl pyridylhydrazones were prepared. Their facile synthesis relies on arylboronic acids for boron incorporation, enabling significant structural diversity, dual&#8208;state emission, and reversible electrochemical reductions. Donor&#8208;acceptor architectures, constructed by leveraging triphenylamine and carbazole&#8208;functionalized arylboronic acids, result in aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement.







Abstract
Since the development of the chemistry and applications of boron dipyrromethene dyes (BODIPYs), numerous other platforms based on boron complexes of N&#8208;donor ligands have emerged as molecular optoelectronic materials. By tailoring the structure of the ligand bound to boron, the optical and electronic properties of a compound can be precisely tuned for unique properties, such as aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) in the case of boron difluoride hydrazones (BODIHYs). We examine the impact of modifying the typical bidentate hydrazone ligand structure used to prepare BODIHYs to enable a tridentate coordination mode to produce boron complexes of tridentate acyl pyridylhydrazones. This change allows for the use of arylboronic acids as sources of boron and facilitates the inclusion of complex organic components at the boron centre, including the formation of dye&#8208;dye conjugates. The synthesized compounds exhibit distinct optical and electronic properties when compared to BODIHYs, such as reversible electrochemical reduction and up to a &gt;300&#8197;nm pseudo&#8208;Stokes shift in the solid state, all of which were supported by density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Hydroxymethyl&#8208;Substituted Tetrathiatriarylmethanol with Variable Reactivity: Selective Access to Three Different Trityl Radicals by Unique Acid&#8208;Mediated Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of hydroxymethyl&#8208;substituted tetrathiatriarylmethanol with different acids are described. The reaction conditions were optimized for the selective synthesis of hydroxymethyl, methyl and aldehyde derivatives of trityl radicals as well as their deuterated analogues, which exhibit distinct EPR spectra and redox properties, thus suggesting applicability to in&#8208;cell EPR/dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP).







Abstract
Tetrathiatriarylmethyl radicals have found wide applications in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and imaging as well as dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). Recently, intense effort has been devoted to the derivatization of trityl radicals, but there is still a lack of highly efficient methods for access to these radicals. Herein, we report novel acid&#8208;mediated protocols for straightforward and selective synthesis of the hydroxymethyl, aldehyde and methyl derivatives of trityl radicals from the sole substrate hydroxymethyl&#8208;substituted tetrathiatriarylmethanol. The resulting trityl radicals exhibit various redox properties as shown by their cyclic voltammetric results. Importantly, the use of these protocols enables site&#8208;specific deuteration of the three trityl radicals, which show unique EPR spectral properties. Overall, our study reveals the crucial effect of the acids on the synthesis of these trityl radicals and provides a new approach for selective access to different trityl radicals, thus enriching their synthetic chemistry.

         <dc:description>cis&#8208;Linked cyclotetraphenylene dimer [2]c&#8208;CTPE and trimer [3]c&#8208;CTPE were synthesized via Pt&#8208;mediated cyclization of cis&#8208;diboronated tetraphenylethene. The structure of [2]c&#8208;CTPE has been confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The strain energy of [2]c&#8208;CTPE and [3]c&#8208;CTPE was calculated to be 86.28&#183;kJ mol&#8208;1 and 9.23 kJ&#183;mol&#8208;1, respectively. [2]c&#8208;CTPE and [3]c&#8208;CTPE are typical AIEgens and show mechanofluorochromic properties. The comparisons of cis&#8208;linked cyclotetraphenylenes with gem&#8208;linked cyclotetraphenylenes were also discussed.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecules containing ether skeletons are widely present in drugs, natural products, functional materials, and life science. Direct C(sp3)&#8211;H bond ether functionalization is considered a powerful strategy for the construction of novel ether derivatives.

In recent years, photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;mediated C(sp3)&#8211;H bond alkylation, arylation, alkynylation, esterification, mercaptoylation, sulfidation, and amination of ethers have been extensively studied. In this review, the research progress of photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;mediated C(sp3)&#8211;H bond functionalization of ether compounds from 2014 to 2023 is systematically reviewed, and the scope, limitations, and mechanisms for some reactions are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>The Green Synthesis of 2&#8208;Pyrrolin&#8208;5&#8208;ones from Bio&#8208;renewable Glyoxal, Diketones and Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and environmentally benign method was developed for the synthesis of 2&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;5&#8208;ones from dicarbonyl compounds, bio&#8208;renewable glyoxal, and amines. More than 25 new 2&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;5&#8208;one compounds were synthesized in good to high yields under mild conditions.







Abstract
Described herein is an effective and green reaction between diketones, amines and bio&#8208;renewable glyoxal, affording a wide range of 2&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;5&#8208;ones and releasing water as the only byproduct. The reaction features step&#8208;economy, high efficiency, mild conditions, broad substrate scope, hazardous waste avoiding and easy scale&#8208;up. The further transformation between the products and aldehydes can be potentially applied for fluorescent dye synthesis.

         <dc:description>The decarboxylative addition of substituted malonic acid half oxyesters (SMAHOs) to dialkyl azodicarboxylates is described. The reaction was promoted by 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) as an organocatalyst in heated toluene. High yields of the coupling products were generally obtained, and the scope of the reaction proved rather important with the potential presence of functionalized pending chains at the &#945;&#8208;position, affording an original access to &#945;&#8208;aminoester derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring an Optimised Approach for Converting 6&#8208;Thioguanosine Derivatives to Asymmetric Disulphides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we present the systematic analysis of conversion of 6&#8208;thioguanosine derivatives into unsymmetrical disulphides. Within the work we explored three known strategies for the preparation of disulphide bonds for 6&#8208;thioguanosine and its phosphorylated derivatives. We have shown that obtained derivatives are stable under certain conditions and can be easily further expanded using various tags depending on need.







Abstract
Here we present a systematic analysis of the synthesis of unsymmetrical disulphides employing 6&#8208;thioguanosine and its mono&#8208; and dinucleotides by three of the most common strategies: a nucleophilic substitution of the thiol, a thiol exchange reaction with another disulphide and oxidative dehydrogenation coupling reactions of S&#8722;H bonds. The exchange reaction was found to be the most efficient approach and could be used not only for nucleosides but also for nucleotides.

         <title>Direct ortho&#8208;Selective Amination of Naphthols with Nitroarenes through Transfer&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient transition&#8208;metal free synthesis of ortho&#8208;arylaminonaphthols from nitroarenes has been developed for the first time using alcohols or ethers as a hydrogen donor.







Abstract
Hydrogen atom transfer from commonly used solvents to nitroarenes occurred. Such solvents required C(sp3)H&#8208;C(sp3)H bond adjacent to oxygen atoms, such as 1,4&#8208;dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, alkanol, ethylene glycol, glycerol and bis(2&#8208;methoxyethyl) ether. The transformation was transition&#8208;metal free and the reduced nitroarenes were trapped by naphthols and their analogues at ortho&#8208;position. The protocol provided a favourable and efficient route to access ortho&#8208;arylaminonaphthols and a possible mechanism is depicted.

         <title>CAN Interceded Oxidative Coupling of &#946;&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds to 2&#8208;Aryl/Heteroarylchromenes: A Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Synthesis of Tetrahydro&#8208;benzofuro[3,2&#8208;c]chromenones</title>

A CAN mediated oxidative coupling of 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds to 2&#8208;arylchromenes followed by cyclization affords tetrahydro&#8208;benzofuro[3,2&#8208;c]chromenones with regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity in high yield.







Abstract
A promising and useful method has been accomplished for regio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of tetrahydro&#8208;benzofuro[3,2&#8208;c]chromenones through ceric(IV) ammonium nitrate (CAN) mediated oxidative coupling of cyclic/acyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds to 2&#8208;aryl/heteroarylchromenes followed by a base assisted cyclization. The significant features of the method encircle easy accessibility of the starting materials, high air stability and low toxicity of oxidant CAN, high product yield, operationally simple and eco&#8208;friendly reaction conditions. Trapping of a radical intermediate with radical scavenger TEMPO (detected by LC&#8211;MS) from the reaction mixture proved that the oxidative coupling is a radical mediated process.

         <title>Nitration of Pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines with NaNO2/HFIP</title>

         <dc:description>
A mild nitration of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines has been reached in a NaNO2/HFIP reaction system.







Abstract
A mild nitration of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines has been reached using sodium nitrite as nitro source in HFIP at ambient temperature. A variety of nitro&#8208;bearing pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline derivatives has been efficiently prepared in poor to quantitative yields (28&#8211;98&#8201;%). These products can be easily transformed to primary amines and amide by simple chemical reactions. Treatment of other nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles such as pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoline and substituted indoles under this developed reaction system afforded nitro&#8208;bearing N&#8208;heterocycles in relatively lower yields (15&#8211;19&#8201;%).

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron&#8208;based enantiomerism is fragile due to the inherent tendency of a dissociation of a ligand from tetra&#8208;coordinate chiral boron complexes under formation of the achiral tri&#8208;coordinate species. This review will present the different approaches in overcoming the inherent tendency of racemization in boron&#8208;stereogenic compounds. When embedded in an environment of chiral ligands or substituents, configurationally stable boron stereogenic centers can form in a diastereoselective manner. Compounds incorporating boron as the exclusive stereogenic center are obtained by resolution of the racemic mixtures. The recently developed &#8211; much more efficient &#8211; methods of a catalytic, enantioselective creation of boron stereogenic compounds are highlighted in this review. Finally the chiroptical properties of enantiomerically pure boron complexes that makes them promising materials or devices are addressed.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Application of a New Class of Planar and Centrally Chiral Ferrocenyl Amino Alcohol Ligands</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly enantioselective, facile, scalable, and robust synthesis of a new family (14 examples) of amino alcohol ligands possessing planar and central chirality that is described. They were applied to the diethylzinc and diphenylzinc additions to aldehydes with up to 98&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee and 82&#8201;% yield and 88&#8201;% ee, respectively.







Abstract
A family of ferrocenyl amino alcohols (14 examples) has been prepared from the corresponding planar chiral ketones and evaluated as a new class of chiral ligands for asymmetric ethyl&#8208; and phenylzinc additions to aldehydes. The highly enantioselective synthesis of these ligands is facile, scalable, robust and relies on the use of cheaply available starting materials. Asymmetric ethyl additions proceeded smoothly at ambient temperature, with reaction times as short as 1&#8197;hour furnishing the desired products in up to 90&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee. The corresponding phenyl additions afforded products in up to 81&#8201;% yield and 88&#8201;% ee. The observed stereochemical outcome for the addition of diethylzinc was rationalized and the key proposed transition state was supported by an analysis of the X&#8208;ray structures of a series of amino alcohol ligands.

         <title>Continuous Preparative Application of Amine Transaminase&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions with Integrated Crystallization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ product crystallization (ISPC) was used to semicontinuously remove chiral amines from amine transaminase catalyzed reactions. The use of a constant mild vacuum facilitated the synthesis of six compounds in this way in a preparative fashion at gram scale with yields of up to 80&#8201;%. The process included intermittent removal steps of the product salt and the replenishment of substrates every 24&#8197;h







Abstract
Transaminases are valuable catalysts in the synthesis of chiral amines. However, secondary techniques are typically required to shift the reaction equilibrium to the product side. This study focuses on the in&#8197;situ product crystallization, specifically at preparative synthetic scale as a non&#8208;synthetic tool for a selection of aromatic and aliphatic substrates using the transaminase from Silicibacter pomeroyi. Herein the technique is implemented in a simplified manner to facilitate in&#8197;situ product removal and downstream&#8208;processing in a combined crystallization step. After a series of optimizations, product concentrations of &gt;0.9&#8197;mol/L and &gt;99&#8201;% e.e. (S) were obtained implementing a repetitive batch reaction approach using a universal carboxylate as anion.

         <title>Direct Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction of Biomass&#8208;Derived Furfurol with Maleimides in a Bio&#8208;Based Green Solvent</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Environmental concern has motivated an inclination to exploit waste and upgrade it into high&#8208;added&#8208;value chemicals. Biomass is an excellent carbon source that provides a variety of raw materials as building blocks, such as furans. Herein, we report the upcycling of furfurol, a known biomass by&#8208;product, through a Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition with maleimides that is performed in a green bio&#8208;derived solvent, 2&#8208;MeTHF. We provide two alternative sets of reaction conditions to promote&#160;exo&#160;or&#160;endo&#160;selectivity, which depends on the temperature employed. A variety of products were obtained in 70&#8208;96% yield and high&#160;exo&#160;selectivity at 80 &#176;C, while a 30:70&#8208;45:55&#160;exo/endo&#160;ratio was produced at room temperature. A large&#8208;scale reaction was also performed.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploitation of Mechanistic Product Selectivity for the Two&#8208;step Synthesis of Optically Active Bio&#8208;derived Cyclic Carbonates Incorporating Amino Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of bio&#8208;derived cyclic carbonates is attracting a lot of attention as the incorporation of bio&#8208;derived functionality into these compounds provides the opportunity to prepare previously unknown structures, whilst also improving their sustainability profiles. This study presents a facile preparation of diastereomerically pure bio&#8208;derived cyclic carbonates displaying a range of optical rotation values. These compounds are obtained from glycidol, amino acids and CO2&#160;in a facile two&#8208;step approach. Initially, the diastereomerically pure amino acid functionalised epoxides are prepared through a robust Steglich esterification of enantiopure glycidol (R&#160;or&#160;S) and an amino acid (D&#160;or&#160;L). Thereafter, in a second step, cycloaddition of the epoxide with CO2&#160;results in the retention of the initial stereochemistry of the epoxide, furnishing novel diastereomerically pure and optically active cyclic carbonate products. A DFT study has explained the basis of this observed retention of configuration for these compounds. Further, results from this DFT study also provide new mechanistic information concerning a co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free cycloaddition reaction starting from glycidol when using the gallium&#8208;catalyst, which is found to operate through metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyfluorinated carbohydrates have attracted attention in the last decades. This is due to the interesting properties of such organofluorines. What about the other halogens? Since the discovery of sucralose (a trichlorinated disaccharide) more than 50 years ago, only a handful of chlorinated, brominated, or iodinated carbohydrates have been reported. This review focuses on the synthesis of polyhalogenated carbohydrates, including sugar inter&#8208;halides, but excluding polyfluorinated sugars. An overview of the current state of the art of their potential application is also described.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Methylenecyclobutenes by [2+2] Cycloaddition of Allene Ethers and Alkyne</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylenecyclobutenes are synthesized via thermal conditions between allene ethers and alkyne and successfully transformed to other four&#8208;membered ring compounds. This strategy provides a series of methylenecyclobutenes in moderate yields with broad functional groups.







Abstract
Methylenecyclobutenes are useful precursors to provide other organic compounds. We report intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of allene ethers and alkynes at 100&#8201;&#176;C, which gives methylenecyclobutenes in 50&#8211;60&#8201;% yields. The reaction does not require any metal catalyst and shows broad substrate scope, high regioselectivity and high stereoselectivity.

         <title>Stereoselective Total Synthesis of Pyranicin and 4&#8208;epi&#8208;Pyranicin from Carbohydrate Precursors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe a simple and efficient pathway for the total synthesis of pyranicin and 4&#8208;epi&#8208;pyranicin by utilizing carbohydrates as chiral raw materials for the first time. The general synthetic strategy involves the formation of two main fragments: Fragment 1 is the central tetrahydropyran core, which was constructed in a total of 10 steps from 2,3,4,6&#8208;tetra&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl D&#8208;glucal via Ferrier&#8208;type rearrangement and oxidative cyclization as the key steps. Fragment 2 is the butenolide fragment, which was obtained in a gram scale with a total of 14 steps from diacetyl&#8208;L&#8208;rhamnal involving a ring contraction strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free ipso&#8208;Halocyclization of N&#8208;arylpropynamides Using Hypervalent Iodine(III) Reagents under Aqueous Condition</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report, an intramolecular ipso&#8208;halocyclization of N&#8208;arylpropynamides using readily available hypervalent iodine reagent as mild oxidant and alkali halides like KCl, KBr, and KI as the halogen source. Using this method, a broad range of valuable halogenated spiro[4.5]trienones can be obtained in an excellent yield at room temperature. Notably, this protocol doesn&#8217;t require para&#8208;substituents such as methoxy or fluoro group on the N&#8208;aryl ring. Also, this reaction takes place in the absence of any metal catalyst under aqueous conditions and exhibits a broad substrate scope with high functional group tolerance. A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed based on control experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Allure of HFIP in Unsaturated Carbon&#8722;Carbon Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This mini&#8208;review emphasizes the versatility and significance of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) solvent in Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions, primality focusing on the regio&#8208; and stereoselective functionalization of unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds (alkenes, alkynes, and allenes). The complexity of its mechanisms adds depth to its utility beyond conventional solvent applications.







Abstract
Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) stands out as a versatile solvent in synthetic chemists&#8217; repertoire, facilitating a diverse array of intricate chemical reactions. It demonstrates a multifaceted role that extends beyond conventional uses and, in many cases, the mechanism appears to be complicated. This feature article elucidates the significance of HFIP in the context of Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions with a specific emphasis on the regio&#8208; and stereoselective functionalization of unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds.

         <title>A Short Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;6,7&#8208;Secoagroclavine via Metal&#8208;Free Reductive Coupling</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two Csp3&#8722;Csp2 and Csp3&#8722;H bonds are formed on the same carbon atom by reacting the tosylhydrazone of chiral Uhle's ketone with 2,2&#8208;dimethylethenylboronic acid. This metal&#8208;free reductive coupling afforded an unexplored disconnection for the asymmetric synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;6,7&#8208;secoagroclavine.







Abstract
A concise, convergent, and enantioselective synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;6,7&#8208;secoagroclavine, a pivotal intermediate in the synthesis of both clavine and ergot alkaloids, was accomplished from a derivative of the renowned Uhle's ketone. The synthesis is centered on metal&#8208;free reductive coupling of the tosylhydrazone derivative of protected 4&#8208;amino Uhle's ketone and commercially available 2,2&#8208;dimethylethenylboronic acid, which is used as a four&#8208;carbon building block. This novel approach directly sets the stereochemistry on the difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access aryl vinyl methane carbon stereogenic center of (&#8722;)&#8208;6,7&#8208;secoagroclavine.

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Catenanes Platformed with meso&#8208;Arylporphyrin</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among mechanically interlocked supramolecular systems with cyclodextrins (CDs), successful examples of CD&#8208;based catenanes are limited compared to a number of CD rotaxanes owing to the synthetic difficulties. We herein demonstrate an efficient synthesis of a CD&#8208;based catenane using a meso&#8208;arylporphyrin (Por) platform. Using Por modified with two olefin&#8208;terminated oxyethylene chains at the cis&#8208;meso&#8208;positions, an interlocked Por&#8208;CD catenane was synthesized via olefin metathesis in the presence of per&#8208;O&#8208;methylated &#946;&#8208;CD (TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD) in water. The novel Por&#8208;CD catenane was obtained in 30% isolated yield, which was characterized by MALDI&#8208;TOF mass and NMR spectroscopies. In the latter part, we demonstrate determination of the binding constants between TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD and meso&#8208;(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin using Por&#8208;CD catenane, 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD (DMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD), and 13C&#8208;labeled TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD (13C&#8208;TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD). The host&#8208;guest exchange reaction from the Por&#8208;CD catenane/DMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD to the Por&#8208;CD catenane/TMe&#8208;b&#8208;CD complexes was directly monitored through 1D HMQC spectroscopy. The ratio of these complexes revealed the difference in the binding affinities of DMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD and TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD to Por. The stable 1:2 inclusion complex between meso&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin (TPPS) and TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD has been well&#8208;studied for many years. This study is the first to determine the respective binding constants, K1 and K2, using the model system, to be 3.0 x 107 M&#8211;1 and 3.4 x 107 M&#8211;1, respectively.</dc:description>

A series of the alkylperoxy derivatives of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2(5H)&#8208;furanones and Meldrum&#8217;s acids were synthesized in moderate to good yields (13&#8208;86%). The functionalization of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2(5H)&#8208;furanones by the tBuOO group was performed with high selectivity in the presence of the cocktail of reactive oxidizing species, including metal and radical intermediates. The key species in the peroxidation process are probably the tert&#8208;butylperoxy radical or its Co(III) complex, which are generated from the Co(II)/TBHP system.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of  Azadibenzo[a,e]pyrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four different isomeric azadibenzo[a,e]pyrenes (benzo[4,10]anthra[9,1&#8208;gh]isoquinolines and benzo[4,10]anthra[1,9&#8208;fg]isoquinolines) were prepared by combination of Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira and Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling, Br&#248;nsted acid mediated cycloisomerization and Pd&#8208;catalysed CH&#8208;activation reactions. The optical properties have been studied by steady&#8208;state absorption and emission spectroscopy in different solvents and during acid titration. Trifluoroacetic acid protonation strongly affects absorption and emission properties, with variations depending on the position of the nitrogen atom of the specific compound. Electrochemical analysis showed distinct oxidation and reduction potentials. DFT calculations provided further insights into electronic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 5,9&#8208;Diaza Analogues of [5]&#8208; and [6]Helicene and their Chiroptic and Photophysical Characterization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
5,9&#8208;Diaza[5]&#8208; and &#8208;[6]helicenes were synthesized by ortho,ortho&#8217; fusion of ortho&#8208;teraryls. The [6]helicene could be resolved in its enantiomers. Photophysical properties of both compounds were determined by measurements and calculations.







Abstract
6,10&#8208;Dipropyl&#8208;5,9&#8208;diaza[5]&#8208; and &#8208;[6]helicene were synthesized by ortho,ortho&#8217; fusion of ortho&#8208;teraryldicarboxamides. Key steps in the synthesis of the teraryls are azide formation with subsequent reduction and amidation followed by Suzuki cross couplings. The ortho fusions were achieved with phosphorus pentoxide and phosphoryl oxide. The total syntheses could be accomplished with 10&#8201;% and 3&#8201;%, respectively, in seven consecutive steps starting with meta&#8208;dibromobenzene. The helicenes were investigated by UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and by quantum chemical calculation of, inter alia, the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps. Racemization barriers of the helicenes were calculated, whereupon the optical resolution of 5,9&#8208;diaza[6]helicene was attempted and carried out successfully; ECD spectra were measured of its enantiomers.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Thioesters from Amides and Disulfides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nickel&#8208;catalyzed practical and simple synthesis of thioesters from amides and disulfides has been developed. Diverse substituted aromatic amides are capable of coupling with diaryl or dialkyl disulfides via C&#8722;N/S&#8722;S cleavage to produce the desirable thioesters in moderate to good yields. This procedure features cheap metals, novel and easily preparative substrates, providing a simple and practical access to a variety of thioesters without toxic thiols or CO gas.

         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of N&#8208;sulfinylanilines with vinylethylene carbonates and vinyl epoxides has been reported, affording the 1,2,3&#8208;oxathiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;oxides under mild reaction conditions. Further synthetic applications of 1,2,3&#8208;oxathiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;oxides in the preparation of sulfoxides, &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols and amines have also been demonstrated.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation reaction of N&#8208;sulfinylanilines with vinylethylene carbonates and vinyl epoxides is developed. It affords 1,2,3&#8208;oxathiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;oxides under mild reaction conditions through allylic palladium intermediates. The versatile synthetic utility of 1,2,3&#8208;oxathiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;oxides in preparing sulfoxides, &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols, and substituted amines has also been demonstrated.

         <title>Trifluoromethylsulfinylation Reaction of Activated Arenes and Indoles with Trifluoromethanesulfinyl Chloride</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile method for the trifluoromethylsulfinylation of activated arenes with trifluoromethanesulfinyl chloride in the presence of Lewis acid was developed. The protocol could be expanded to the perfluoroalkylsulfinylation of activated arenes, as well as the trifluoromethylsulfinylation of indoles without additive.







Abstract
The trifluoromethylsulfinylation reaction of activated arenes with trifluoromethanesulfinyl chloride (CF3SOCl) in the presence of Lewis acid was achieved under mild and solvent&#8208;free conditions. A series of aryl trifluoromethyl sulfoxides were obtained in moderate to high yields. The protocol could be extended to the perfluoroalkylsulfinylation of activated arenes, as well as the trifluoromethylsulfinylation of indoles without additive.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Fluoroamide&#8208;Directed Remote C(sp3)&#8208;H Bond Functionalization Through Intramolecular Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the recent years, copper&#8208;catalyzed fluoroamide&#8208;directed remote C(sp3)&#8208;H bond functionalization via intramolecular HAT has served as a robust and elegant strategy for the assembly of a variety of functionalized (sulfon)amides and related derivatives. This review focuses on the recent advances in this area. These transformations usually exhibit high efficiency, excellent selectivities and good functional group compatibility.







Abstract
Direct C&#8722;H functionalization is an important strategy for the rapid synthesis of valuable organic molecules. Radical&#8208;involved remote C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization based on hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) becomes an important method enabling selective direct transformation of C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds at specific distal position(s). In the recent years, copper&#8208;catalyzed fluoroamide&#8208;directed remote C(sp3)&#8208;H bond functionalization through intramolecular HAT has served as a robust and elegant strategy for the assembly of a variety of functionalized (sulfon)amides and related derivatives. This review focuses on the recent advances in this area. These transformations proceed effectively with high selectivities and good functional group compatibility under mild conditions.

The bicyclic guanidine 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD) was used as a catalyst to develop a method for the synthesis of 3&#8208;hydroxyisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones from 3&#8208;alkylidenephthalides and amines. This method provides a rapid and more sustainable option with broad scope for the synthesis of such scaffolds.







Abstract
The readily available organocatalyst 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD) was used for the rapid synthesis of 3&#8208;hydroxyisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones from 3&#8208;alkylidenephthalides. The transformation occurs at room temperature and requires less solvent than traditional methods, providing a more sustainable synthetic option to access 3&#8208;hydroxyisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones with broad scope. Elaboration of the products to diverse scaffolds as well as synthesis of biologically active compounds are demonstrated.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the one&#8208;pot direct N&#8208;acylation of indazole with carboxylic acids using DMAPO/Boc2O system. This system is simple and provides N1&#8208;acyl indazoles in high yield with high N1 selectivities. This new method exhibits a wide substrate scope (&gt;40 examples). In addition, a new synthesis of N1&#8208;functionalized alkyl indazoles utilizing N1&#8208;acyl indazoles as starting materials was achieved.







Abstract
This report describes the one&#8208;pot direct N&#8208;acylation of indazole with carboxylic acids using our previously developed 4&#8208;(N,N&#8208;dimethylamino)pyridine N&#8208;oxide (DMAPO)/di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl dicarbonate (Boc2O) system. This simple system provides N1&#8208;acyl indazoles in high yield with high N1 selectivities and does not require the use of activated derivatives of carboxylic acids or high temperatures. This new method exhibits a wide substrate scope (&gt;40 examples). In addition, a new synthesis of N1&#8208;functionalized alkyl indazoles utilizing N1&#8208;acyl indazoles as starting materials was achieved. This stepwise protocol is useful for the selective synthesis of structurally diverse N1&#8208;functionalized alkyl indazoles, which are difficult to synthesize by other methods such as the Mitsunobu reaction and classical SN2 alkylation of indazole.

         <title>Rational Design of Metallylenes for Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Theory&#8211;driven design! Using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical analyses, we screened the hydrogenation capability of a range of diverse metallylene catalysts with varying Group 14 atoms and ligands. Our design features identify that stannylenes featuring a phosphorus&#8211;based ligand have the potential to activate dihydrogen and facilitate the hydrogenation of a spectrum of unsaturated bonds.







Abstract
The hydrogenation of alkenes, alkynes, carbonyls, and imines by H2&#8208;activated metallylenes (H3C&#8722;EH2&#8722;L, CELH2; E=Si, Ge, Sn and L=NMe2, PMe2) was studied using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;BP86/TZ2P. By means of activation strain and Kohn&#8211;Sham molecular orbital analyses, the physical factors underlying the trends in reactivity were identified and quantified. Firstly, the hydrogenation reactivity increases on descending Group 14, that is from silylenes (E=Si) to stannylenes (E=Sn). This reactivity trend originates primarily from a reduced energy required to break the bonds between the Group&#8197;14 atom and the hydrogen atoms because the strength of these bonds decreases from Si&#8722;H to Ge&#8722;H to Sn&#8722;H. Secondly, the reactivity decreases as the Group&#8197;15 ligand changes from nitrogen to phosphorus (L=NMe2, PMe2) which stems from the trigonal pyramidal PMe2 geometry compared to the trigonal planar NMe2 geometry. The latter can, therefore, effectively engage in stronger orbital interactions with the substrate than the former, due to a more efficient HOMO&#8211;LUMO orbital overlap. By combining our insights, we rationally designed an optimally tuned catalyst (Group&#8197;14 atom and ligand) considering the overall catalytic cycle involving H2 activation of the metallylene and subsequent hydrogenation.

         <dc:description>A novel bifunctional isothiourea derived from a tetraarylphosphonium salt catalyzes the coupling reaction of monosubstituted epoxides with 1 atm of carbon dioxide to afford five&#8208;membered cyclic carbonates in high yields.

         <title>Reactivity of Electrophilic Trifluoromethylating Reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kinetics of the reactions of colored carbanions (reference nucleophiles) with S&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)dibenzothiophenium ions (Umemoto&#8217;s reagents) and hypervalent trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted iodine compounds (Togni&#8217;s reagents) have been determined photometrically using stopped&#8208;flow techniques. The second&#8208;order rate constants k2(20 &#176;C) for the reactions of Umemoto&#8217;s sulfonium ions (generation I and II) with the reference nucleophiles in DMSO follow the correlation lg k2(20 &#176;C) = sN(N + E) and can be used to determine the electrophilicity parameters E of these trifluoromethylating reagents. It is shown that the conditions reported for the reactions of Umemoto&#8217;s generation I reagents with a variety of C&#8208;nucleophiles are in line with the electrophilicity parameter E &#8776; &#8211;13 determined for these reagents. Though Togni&#8217;s hypervalent iodine&#8208;based trifluoromethylation reagents do not follow this linear free energy relationship, the kinetics of their reactions with carbanions indicate that they cover the same reactivity range as Umemoto&#8217;s generation I and II reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Radical Borylation of Alkyl Chlorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The traditional method for the preparation of alkylboronic esters involves transition metal catalysis or transition metal&#8208;free methods relying on single electron transfer. Each method relies on the suitable choice of catalyst or electron transfer mediator. In this study, we have developed a new method for the synthesis of alkylboronic esters from alkyl chlorides and diboron(4) compounds, without the need for additional metal or non&#8208;metal catalysts. We discovered that under 400 nm visible light irradiation, alkyl chlorides can be activated in the presence of bis(neopentyl glycolato)diboron and an alkoxide base to form alkyl radical intermediates, which then react with diboron(4) compounds, resulting in high yields of alkylboronic esters. The reaction is applicable to both primary and secondary alkyl chlorides. The simplicity of operation and the broad substrate scope of this method make it practical for the synthesis of valuable alkylboronic ester intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploiting Hydroxamic Acids as Organocatalysts for the Epoxidation of Alkenes with Hydrogen Peroxide as the Oxidant</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalytic epoxidation of alkenes synthesis is presented in which hydroxamic acids are used as the catalyst and hydrogen peroxide as the green oxidant. Mechanistic studies by direct infusion HRMS provide experimental evidence for the formation of various intermediates.







Abstract
The epoxidation of alkenes has altered and reshaped the way scientists think in modern organic synthesis. Herein, a novel, sustainable and eco&#8208;friendly protocol for the epoxidation of alkenes is reported, utilizing hydrogen peroxide as the green oxidant and, for the first time, hydroxamic acid derivatives as the organocatalyst. The presented methodology is very effective, leading to good to high yields for the oxidation of a variety of olefins, while various functional groups are well tolerated. Mechanistic studies utilizing direct infusion high resolution mass spectrometry (DI&#8208;HRMS) provide strong evidence for the mechanism of the organocatalytic oxidation.

         <title>Decatungstate&#8208;Catalyzed Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Formation Between Furfural and Electron&#8208;Deficient Olefins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalization of furfural can be achieved by photocatalytic C&#8722;H activation of the aldehyde and coupling to electron&#8208;deficient olefins. With (Bu4N)4W10O32 as the photocatalyst, furfural can be added to benzylidene malononitriles, acrylates, itaconic anhydride, maleic anhydride, 2&#8208;vinylpyridine and phenyl vinyl sulfone to form the corresponding furanyl ketones in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields.







Abstract
Furfural is produced on a large commercial scale from lignocellulose and can be used for the preparation of several industrial chemicals with four to five carbon atoms. Further functionalization of furfural by C&#8722;H activation, however, is less widely developed. In the present work, tetrabutylammonium decatungstate is investigated as an inexpensive photocatalyst for activating the aldehyde C&#8722;H bond and mediate a coupling between furfural and electron&#8208;deficient olefins. The results show that furfural can be successfully added to benzylidene malononitriles, acrylates, itaconic anhydride, maleic anhydride, 2&#8208;vinylpyridine and phenyl vinyl sulfone to generate the corresponding furanyl ketones in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields. The electronic properties of the electron&#8208;deficient olefins are instrumental for achieving a favorable reaction with furfural. The findings show how photocatalysis can be used to form new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds from a platform molecule, which in this way can be converted into a number of more advanced structures.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Induced Photoredox and Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;N Cross&#8208;Coupling: A Mechanistic Perspective</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article explores the recent achievements and mechanistic development made in the field of photoredox/copper&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling covering several reactions including, decarboxylative, multicomponent, Ullman type coupling, alkylation, and arylation reactions.







Abstract
The formation of C&#8722;N bonds is a vital technique in organic synthesis for creating nitrogen&#8208;containing motifs, which has extensive uses in agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and natural products. Significant progress has been made in constructing C&#8722;N bonds using transition metal catalysis. Nevertheless, utilizing alkyl substrates for the formation of Csp3&#8722;N bonds is a notable challenge. Synergistic photoredox and copper catalysis have proven to be a powerful tool to tackle this challenge. The development of this research domain is still in its early stages owing to the chemical and technical complexities of this catalytic process. This review attempts to summarize in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of the photoredox/copper dual catalysed C&#8722;N coupling reactions taking into consideration of recently reported experimental and theoretical studies.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Alkylation of N&#8208;Heterocycles with Nitriles via Heteroarylphosphonium Intermediates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzothiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;phosphonium and pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;phosphonium salts react with nitrile anions via a proposed nucleophilic aromatic substitution pathway which together with the direct synthesis of phosphonium salts from benzothiazoles and pyridines constitutes an efficient and simple two&#8208;step protocol for C&#8722;H functionalization of these heterocycles.







Abstract
Heteroarylphosphonium salts are easily accessible, versatile intermediates in functionalization of N&#8208;heterocycles. Direct C&#8722;C bond formation by net substitution of the phosphine has so far required transition metal catalysts, the use of strongly basic reagents or redox catalysis. Here we describe a C&#8722;C bond formation in direct reactions of benzothiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;phosphonium and pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;phosphonium salts and nitrile anions which, together with the direct synthesis of phosphonium salts from benzothiazoles and pyridines, constitutes an efficient and simple two&#8208;step protocol for C&#8722;H functionalization of these heterocycles under mild conditions.

         <title>B(C6F5)3&#8208;Catalysed Alkylation of Imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines Using &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones</title>

Fluorinated triarylboranes are employed as a metal free and sustainable catalysts for alkylation of 2&#8208;phenylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones.







Abstract
Fluorinated triarylboranes have shown a breadth of reactivity as catalysts for organic transformations, particularly in carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming reactions. Herein we report a facile, metal&#8208;free synthetic route for the addition of 2&#8208;phenylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones using B(C6F5)3 as a metal&#8208;free catalyst. 25 examples of reactions leading to products in up to 97&#8201;% yield are reported. DFT studies show the role of B(C6F5)3 and hydrogen shuttling in the mechanism of this Michael alkylation.

         <title>Yttrium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydroamination of Norbornene with Simple Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydroamination of norbornene with simple amines remains a major challenge. Now the hydroamination of norbornene with such simple amines is reported, as well as the first rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of norbornenes.







Abstract
The intermolecular hydroamination of norbornene with simple amines was achieved using silyl&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;terphenoxide yttrium complexes. Excellent conversion was obtained for both benzylic and aliphatic amines. For benzyl and linear aliphatic amines, the highest activity was observed for the sterically more encumbered methyldiphenylsilyl&#8208;substituted complex, whereas the trimethylsilyl&#8208;substituted complex was more active for sterically encumbered primary amines.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Regioselective Chlorosulfenylation of Indoles by Dimethylsulfoxide and 1,2&#8208;Dichloroethane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and cost&#8208;effective metal&#8208;free method for vicinal Csp2&#8722;H difunctionalization of indole was reported. The common solvents dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dichloroethane (DCE) were used as precursor to generate chlorodimethylsulfonium ion for electrophilic methylthiolation followed by chlorination by enabling 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;methylthioindoles.







Abstract
Direct chloromethylthiolation of the C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds of indole was achieved with the commonly used solvents dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dichloroethane (DCE). Initially, chlorodimethylsulfonium ion is generated in&#8197;situ from the reaction of DMSO and DCE on simple heating at 120&#8201;&#176;C and is used for electrophilic methylthiolation followed by chlorination, enabling the synthesis of 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;methylthioindoles.

         <title>A Green Approach to Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitutions of Nicotinic Esters in Cyrene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green choice: Cyrene has been used as an eco&#8208;friendly alternative to environmentally harmful polar aprotic solvents in SNAr reactions. This innovative protocol enabled the facile synthesis of a wide library of novel nicotinic esters, valuable precursors of bioactive compounds. This methodology could also be extended to scale&#8208;up processes, microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis, and one&#8208;pot telescoping reactions, thus enhancing its applicability in various eco&#8208;friendly synthetic contexts.







Abstract
The green solvent CyreneTM has emerged as a valuable substitute for conventional polar aprotic organic solvents such as DMF, DMSO and NMP (renowned for their toxicity and environmental concerns). However, in the presence of bases, Cyrene is prone to polymerization, thus potentially incompatible with reactions where a base is needed to generate reactive nucleophiles. In this study, we developed an efficient synthetic strategy for nucleophilic aromatic substitutions of nicotinic esters in Cyrene. The success of this protocol relies on a very short reaction time (only 15 minutes) which prevents polymerization from occurring. Indeed, Cyrene not only outperformed typical solvents such as DMF and DMSO, but also, being highly soluble in water, allowed an easy purification of the desired products by simple precipitation upon the addition of ice&#8208;water.

         <title>Reactivity of Biomass&#8208;Derived Olefins with Elemental Sulfur: Mechanistic Insight</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lignocellulosic biomass remains underutilized despite its annual production in gigaton quantities. Sulfur is another vastly underutilized waste product of fossil fuel refining. New mechanistic insight into the reactions of sulfur unveiled since 2020 suggest a rich and hitherto unexplored chemistry between biomass&#8208;derived olefins and elemental sulfur. In this study, four biomass&#8208;derived olefins (eugenol (1), 4&#8208;allyl&#8208;2,6&#8208;dimethoxy phenol (2), o&#8208;eugenol (3), and 2&#8208;allyl&#8208;6&#8208;methylphenol (4)) were reacted with elemental sulfur to elucidate the S&#8211;C bond&#8208;forming and other reactivity of these compounds. Each of the compounds was reacted with elemental sulfur in three sulfur : organic reactant ratios&#160; (2:1, 4:1 and 9:1) and at two temperatures (180 &#176;C or 230 &#176;C). Product mixtures were characterized using 1H NMR spectrometry and GC&#8208;MS analysis. Products resulting from a range of mechanisms were unveiled, including inverse vulcanization, S&#8211;Callylic/benzylic bond formation, S&#8211;Caryl bond formation, intramolecular cyclization, C&#8211;C s&#8208;bond scission, and C&#8211;O s&#8208;bond scission. It is anticipated that the insights from this study will support further synergy between the critical sustainability goals of biomass and sulfur utilization.</dc:description>

         <title>2H&#8208;Azirines: Recent Progress in Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More recent studies referring to the synthesis of 2H&#8208;arizines and their [3+n] ring&#8208;expansion, nucleophilic addition of C=N double bond, continuous nucleophilic addition/cyclization, ring&#8208;opening reactions to acyclic compounds and site&#8208;selective functionalization are reviewed. The review mainly covers the period from 2019 to 2023.







Abstract
2H&#8208;arizines are important three&#8208;membered heterocycles in organic chemistry. Recently, many advances in the synthesis and functionalization of 2H&#8208;arizines have been reported. Neber rearrangement, isomerization of isoxazole, oxidation of enamine, C&#8722;H bond activation, decomposition of vinyl azide, functionalization of alkyne, and multi&#8208;step synthesis have been developed for the efficient assembly of 2H&#8208;azirines. As versatile and highly strained three&#8208;membered unsaturated heterocycles, 2H&#8208;azirines can be used as distinctive building blocks towards significant functional groups, and have attracted extensive attention for the fabrication of numerous heterocycles. Recent studies have focused on [3+n] ring&#8208;expansion reactions, nucleophilic addition of C=N double bond or continuous nucleophilic addition followed by cyclization, ring&#8208;opening of 2H&#8208;azirines to acyclic compounds, and substitution of sp3&#8208;C&#8722;H of 2H&#8208;azirines. One of the most critical challenges is seeking for a selective opening of the specific three bonds of the strained azirine circle, some of what can be achieved on the basis of metal catalyst, photocatalysis, or combination of metal catalyst and photocatalysis. In this review, recent advances involving the synthesis and reactivity of 2H&#8208;arizines accompanied with challenges and breakthroughs are summarized. The review mainly covers the period from 2019 to 2023.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation and Deuteration Reactions of Bicyclic Alkenes in an Aqueous Environment</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation and deuteration of bicyclic alkenes, utilizing H2O and D2O as hydrogen sources with Zn0 or Mn0 reductants. Lewis&#8208;acid co&#8208;catalysts facilitated reactions and promoted transesterification. Introduction of 1&#8197;atm of H2 allowed catalytic metal reductant loading. These processes displayed excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance, consistently yielding high&#8208;product yields.







Abstract
Herein, we report cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation and deuteration reactions of bicyclic alkenes using H2O and D2O as the sole hydrogen and deuterium sources, respectively, employing Zn or Mn as a metal reductant. Lewis&#8208;acid co&#8208;catalysts were found to promote the reaction whilst simultaneously catalyzing transesterification processes. Use of 1&#8197;atm of H2 allows for catalytic loading of the metal reductant. In all cases, the reaction operated with high functional&#8208;group tolerance and produced reduced products in high yield.

         <title>Formylation of Propargylic Alcohols with Difluorocarbene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed an efficient method for the formylation reaction of propargylic alcohols and sodium chlorodifluoroacetate under mild conditions. It is the first example of the use of difluorocarbene as a carbonyl source and the reaction of propargylic alcohols to form formates.







Abstract
A method for the synthesis of propargylic formates from propargylic alcohols and sodium chlorodifluoroacetate is reported. In the reaction, sodium chlorodifluoroacetate is used as a difluorocarbene precursor and a formylating reagent to provide a carbonyl source, while the triple bond of propargylic alcohols is not involved. The method shows convenient operation, good functional group tolerance and high site&#8208;selectivity under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Access to Secondary Amines through Hydrogen Autotransfer Reaction Mediated by KOtBu</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potassium tert&#8208;butoxide was used for the direct synthesis of secondary amines through a hydrogen autotransfer reaction. Control experiments were carried out to identify the reaction intermediates and the role of the K+ ion in the reaction, and DFT calculations unveiled the reaction mechanism. The reaction has wide substrate scope with high functional&#8208;group tolerance.







Abstract
We report herein an N&#8208;alkylation reaction of amines with alcohols through a hydrogen autotransfer reaction. Unlike other catalytic systems containing transition metals or additives, potassium tertiary butoxide was found to be a unique and effective catalyst for synthesizing secondary amines. The role of the K+ ion and the reaction intermediates were studied under control experiments and by theoretical calculations. The reaction was found to be general and tolerates a series of functional groups, providing a convenient method to synthesize N&#8208;alkylated compounds.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and efficient process for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;fluorothioethers via a three&#8208;component fluorothiolation of alkenes with thiophenols and selectfluor is reported. The reaction underwent a novel radical process, in which the chloride&#8208;activated Selectfluor was used to generate key active radical intermediates. This protocol was applicable to a wide range of functionalized alkenes and thiophenols, affording a series of &#946;&#8208;fluorothioethers in good yields.







Abstract
This study describes a chloride&#8208;induced three&#8208;component fluorothiolation of alkenes with arylthiophenols and selectfluor, facilitating efficient synthesis of &#946;&#8208;fluorothioether. The protocol exhibits good functional group compatibility, mild reaction conditions, good yield, and readily available reagents. Importantly, this study presents an unprecedented radical&#8208;involved process for fluorothiolation.

&lt;p&gt;A practical and mild electrochemical dehydrogenative regioselective cyclization method has been established for the synthesis of 4-pyrrolin-2-ones using 3-aza-1,5-dienes and 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds as substrates. This protocol is catalyst-free, metal-free, and does not require oxidizing agents. It exhibits wide substrate compatibility and can be easily scaled up to the gram scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalysed Transfer Hydrogenation Reactions with Glycerol and Carbohydrates as Hydrogen Donors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysed transfer hydrogenation using non&#8208;toxic, low cost and renewable biomass as hydrogen donors represents a sustainable and promising approach for the reduction of organic compounds. In this context, glycerol and carbohydrates are attractive hydrogen donors. In this review, we explore various catalytic systems that have been reported for reducing various unsaturated compounds, as well as the advantages and challenges associated with biomass in transfer hydrogenation reactions.







Abstract
Catalytic transfer hydrogenation is a practical approach for reduction of various unsaturated compounds and an alternative to pressurised hydrogenation and traditional metal hydride reagents. Among the various hydrogen donors, biomass such as glycerol and carbohydrates received considerable attention for the reduction reactions due to their non&#8208;toxic, eco&#8208;friendly and renewable nature. The present review addresses the development of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts for the transfer hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds, alkenes, alkynes, nitro compounds, CO2 etc. using glycerol and carbohydrates as potential hydrogen donors.

         <title>Asymmetric Organocatalyzed Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Aminophosphinates via Thiourea Anion&#8208;Binding Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P&#8208;Stereogenic &#945;&#8208;aminophosphinates were obtained in high enantioselectivity via anion&#8208;binding catalysis with thiourea catalysts, further expanding the range of nucleophiles that can be used in this type of catalysis.







Abstract
Thioureas catalyze the reaction of phosphonites with in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated isoquinolinium salts to give C and P&#8208;stereogenic &#945;&#8208;aminophosphinates in high enantioselectivity (up to 96&#8201;%) and yield (up to 95&#8201;%). Low diastereoselectivity was obtained and this is rationalized in the context of a mechanistic proposal involving anion&#8208;binding catalysis of the P&#8722;C bond formation step followed by uncatalyzed Arbuzov collapse. The scope of the reaction, including a g&#8208;scale example, was demonstrated.

         <title>Synthesis and Photochemical Characterization of Indolizine Fluorophores Obtained by a Multicomponent Palladium Iodide&#8722;Catalyzed Oxidative Aminocarbonylation Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N,N&#8208;disubstituted 2&#8208;(indolizin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)acetamides with fluorescent properties are obtained in a multicomponent fashion starting from simple building blocks (2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pent&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;carbonyl compounds, CO, amines, and oxygen) through a sequential PdI2/KI&#8208;catalyzed oxidative aminocarbonylation &#8211; cyclization &#8211; aromatization process. Initially formed 2&#8208;ynamide intermediates, ensuing from Pd&#8208;catalyzed triple bond oxidative aminocarbonylation, are converted in&#8197;situ into the final products by amine&#8208;promoted intramolecular dearomative conjugate addition followed by rearomatization.







Abstract
A catalytic carbonylative method for the direct, multicomponent synthesis of indolizine fluorophores has been developed. The process is based on the PdI2/KI&#8208;catalyzed oxidative aminocarbonylation of 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pent&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;carbonyl compounds leading to the corresponding 2&#8208;ynamide intermediates, followed in&#8197;situ by 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization (by amine&#8208;promoted conjugate addition of the pyridine ring nitrogen) and aromatization, to give the finally isolated N,N&#8208;disubstituted 2&#8208;(indolizin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)acetamides. Reactions are carried out under relatively mild conditions (100&#8201;&#176;C under 20&#8197;atm of a 4&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture CO&#8722;air for 6&#8211;15&#8197;h) in MeCN as the solvent and with a low catalyst loading (0.33&#8197;mol% PdI2), in the presence of 0.5 equiv. of KI and 3 equiv. of a secondary amine. The optical properties of representative 2&#8208;(indolizin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)acetamide products have also been investigated.

         <title>Chemical Strategies for the Cleavage of the C(sp3)&#8722;F Bonds in Perfluoroalkyl Groups</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent environmental pollutants. In this work, we summarized recent progress on the chemical defluorination of PFAS via cleavage of unactivated C&#8722;F bonds in longer perfluoroalkyl groups under mild conditions (~150&#8201;&#176;C). In addition to classic reductive defluorination, the strategies featuring Lewis acidic activation and transient generation of an unsaturated bond are described.







Abstract
Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been recognized as environmental pollutants. Hence, their efficient and mild destruction is a significant research interest. While many research articles and review papers have reported the cleavage of the C(sp2)&#8722;F bonds, single C(sp3)&#8722;F bond, and CF3 groups in PFAS, in this study, limited and emerging examples of a longer&#160;perfluoroalkyl group containing at least one repeating unit of 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethylene was focused. In this&#160;Concept, we summarized recent progress on the chemical defluorination of PFAS via the cleavage of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;F bonds in longer perfluoroalkyl groups under mild conditions (~150&#8201;&#176;C). In addition to classical reductive defluorination, strategies featuring Lewis acid activation and the transient generation of an unsaturated bond were described.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Ring Opening Reactions of Vinylcyclopropanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vinylcyclopropanes can be generally classified as activated and unactivated VCPs. Activated VCPs have strong electron withdrawing groups present in the cyclopropane ring, while unactivated VCPs lack strong electron withdrawing groups in their structures. These VCPs can be activated using suitable asymmetric catalysts to afford various types of chiral ring&#8208;opened products that are synthetically valuable compounds.







Abstract
Vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs) are important building blocks with multifaceted reactivity. Catalytic asymmetric ring opening of vinylcyclopropanes is a highly efficient process to access valuable chiral molecules with diverse functionalities that can be further functionalized for a series of synthetic purposes. VCPs are very well&#8208;known substrates for cycloaddition reactions and this chemistry has been widely explored. On the contrary, despite of enormous synthetic potential, development of new innovative strategies for the catalytic, asymmetric ring opening of VCPs is somewhat underdeveloped. Recently, several significant examples have emerged in the literature for various asymmetric ring opening of both activated and unactivated vinylcyclopropanes that involve transition metal catalysis. These developments are relevant additions to the vinylcyclopropane chemistry. In this review, we aim to summarize all the catalytic asymmetric ring opening transformations reported till date and provide a comprehensive analysis of these research outcomes.

         <title>Lewis Base&#8208;Boryl Radicals Promoted Selective Mono&#8208; and Di&#8208; Hydrodechlorination of Trichloroacetamides and Acetates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
4&#8208;Dimethylaminopyridine&#160;(DMAP)&#8208; and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;boryl radicals were found to promote selective mono&#8208; or dihydrodechlorination of trichloroacetamides and acetates upon treatment with dilauroyl peroxide (DLP) as radical initiator and thiophenol as polarity reversal catalyst. Substituting the hydrogen atom donor, i.&#8201;e. Lewis base&#8208;borane, to its deuterated counterparts promoted mono&#8208; or dideuterodechlorination instead.







Abstract
Mono and dichloro&#8208;substituted organic molecules are shown to possess significant roles in various fields, especially in medicinal chemistry. One approach to synthesizing these compounds involves the selective dechlorination of easily prepared trichloromethyl compounds. Nevertheless, developing a practical approach that allows selective mono&#8208; and dihydrodechlorination is a challenging task. Herein, we introduced a method for selective mono&#8208; and dihydrodechlorination of trichloroacetamides and acetates which was promoted by two different Lewis base&#8208;boryl radicals. Accordingly, 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)&#8208;borane enabled mono&#8208;substitution of chlorine atom by hydrogen while dihydro&#8208;substitution of chlorine atoms was promoted by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;boryl radical. Using deuterated Lewis base&#8208;borane as deuterium atom source, mono&#8208; and dideuterodechlorination were also successfully took place. This protocol features broad substrate scope and operates under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Catalytic C(sp2)&#8722;H Trifluoroethylation of Indoles via Iron&#8208;Carbene Insertion</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A iron&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H bond trifluoroethylation of electron&#8208;rich aromatic system using N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones as carbene precursor is reported. This method allowed for the trifluoroethylation of indoles in high yield with excellent functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Pharmacological properties of a bioactive molecule can be improved significantly by placing a fluoroalkyl group on its scaffold. However, direct stitching of fluoroalkyl groups to aromatic compounds via C&#8722;H bond activation or insertion reaction is a difficult task, thus challenging and of high demand. Herein, an alternative to the Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation, we describe an uncharted strategy for selective and efficient trifluoroethylation of indole that relies on iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation of aromatic compounds and proceeds via Fe(III)&#8208;carbene insertion into C(sp2)&#8722;H bond of indole using trifluoroacetaldehyde N&#8208;triftosylhydrazone as a carbene precursor and FeTPPCl as catalyst.

         <title>A Practical, Scalable Synthesis of 1,18&#8208;Octadecanedioic acid&#8208;Paclitaxel (ODDA&#8208;PTX)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Paclitaxel is one of the most important chemotherapy agents and it has shown activity against a variety of human cancers. In the past years several derivatives and formulations have been developed to improve its activity and reduce its toxicity. Recently, 1,18&#8208;Octadecanedioic acid&#8208;Paclitaxel (ODDA&#8208;PTX), obtained by conjugation of Paclitaxel with a long&#8208;chain diacid, has emerged as a promising Paclitaxel prodrug, with high efficacy and low toxicity. A novel strategy for its synthesis has been developed and is herein described. The approach is based on the mono&#8208;allyl protection of octadecanedioic acid (ODDA) and on the Pd&#8208;catalyzed removal of the allyl ester after coupling with Paclitaxel. This strategy is superior to previously reported procedures in that it affords the ODDA&#8208;PTX product with much higher purity, avoids chromatographic purifications and can be practically scaled&#8208;up for the industrial production of ODDA&#8208;PTX.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperativity in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Macrocycles Derived from Nucleobases</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical analyses reveal that introducing rigid linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated acetylene linkers into a supramolecular building block hampers the cooperative self&#8208;assembly of hydrogen&#8208;bonded macrocycles. This effect originates from the electron abstracting capability of the linker and becomes amplified when the size of the linker increases.







Abstract
Introducing a rigid linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated acetylene linker into a supramolecular building block consisting of a hydrogen&#8208;bond donor side and a hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor side yields a decrease in cooperativity in the resulting formed quartet. This follows from our Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital and Voronoi deformation density analyses of hydrogen&#8208;bonded macrocycles based on guanine and cytosine nucleobases. The acetylene linker abstracts electron density from the hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor and donor, making the hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor more negatively charged and the hydrogen&#8208;bond donor more positively charged and hence suppressing the donor&#8211;acceptor charge transfer interaction between the interacting fragments. This, ultimately, hampers the cooperativity in the hydrogen&#8208;bonded macrocycle. We envision that these findings could open the door to new design principles for the development of novel hydrogen&#8208;bond supramolecular macrocycles.

         <title>Organocatalytic Asymmetric Reduction of &#948;&#8208;Nitro Dienes: a Viable Entry to Functionalized Amines and Highly Substituted Enantioenriched Cyclopentanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new asymmetric organocatalytic reaction to afford enantioenriched &#948;&#8208;nitro alkene analogues and their synthetic manipulation are presented. The chiral nitro alkene was further used in a stereoselective cyclization reaction to afford an almost enantiomerically pure highly functionalised cyclopentane featuring five contiguous stereocenters.







Abstract
&#948;&#8208;nitro dienes were successfully synthesized and converted to &#948;&#8208;nitro alkenes with complete chemo and regioselectivity. The enantioselective organocatalytic reduction was also accomplished and afforded the product in up to 97&#8201;% e.e. The chiral nitro alkene was further elaborated and employed as starting material in a stereoselective cyclization reaction that led to an almost enantiomerically pure highly functionalised cyclopentane featuring 5 contiguous stereocenters.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we demonstrated a visible light mediated tandem oxidation&#8210;organo catalyzed C&#8210;S bond functionalization protocol for the cleavage of aromatic C&#8210;S bond. The investigation encompassed the functionalization of C&#8210;S bonds within sulfones, sulfoxides, and aliphatic sulfide derivatives. However, the process of functionalizing the C&#8210;S bond in aromatic sulfides remains uncertain. The presented protocol demonstrates the C&#8210;S bond functionalization on benzo[b]benzo[4,5]thieno[2,3&#8208;d]thiophene derivative and amines including primary and secondary amines as well.

         <title>Bifunctional Iodoazolium Salts: Searching for Cooperation Between Halogen Bonding and Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;covalent interactions play an important role in all sub&#8208;fields of chemistry, including catalysis, where interactions of different natures can work together to improve reactivities and selectivities. Several families of molecules that incorporate both hydrogen bond (HB) and halogen bonding (XB) donors have already been studied. However, there is a lack of data on how grafting HB donors to iodoazolium salts could impact their association and reactivity properties. Herein, we disclose the synthesis of a library of iodoazolium salts bearing varied HB donors, along with a study of their physico&#8208;chemical properties using different techniques (X&#8208;ray diffraction, 31P NMR, ITC) and their behavior in catalysis. Even though no clear&#8208;cut evidence of cooperation between XB and HB could be obtained through physico&#8208;chemical evaluations, a iodoazolium salt bearing a urea function displayed better conversion and product selectivity in a Ritter reaction than all other activators lacking one or the other function.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbofluorination of &#960;&#8208;Bonds and Related Reactions Involving Tandem C&#8722;C/C&#8722;F Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review on the carbofluorination of &#960;&#8208;bonds and related transformations involving tandem C&#8722;C/C&#8722;F bond forming reactions is presented. The application of electrophilic fluorine and nucleophilic fluoride reagents in this chemistry is described, as well as recently developed protocols involving the use of fluorinated organic molecules in atom&#8208;economic carbofluorination reactions.







Abstract
Due to the unique properties of C&#8722;F bonds, organofluorine compounds occupy a privileged space in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and polymer industries. Carbofluorination reactions involve the formation of a C&#8722;C and a C&#8722;F bond, typically across a &#960;&#8208;bond or another unsaturated functionality that is revealed upon in situ activation. The design of tailored substrates and new catalyst systems has enabled carbofluorination chemistry to emerge as a promising manifold for the synthesis of unique fluorinated scaffolds. This review covers the application of nucleophilic and electrophilic fluorinating reagents in this chemistry, in addition to recently developed atom&#8208;economical carbofluorination reactions using organofluorine compounds as dual reagents.
