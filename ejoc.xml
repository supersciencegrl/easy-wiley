      <title>Highly Enantioselective Ring&#8208;Opening of meso&#8208;Epoxides with O&#8208; and N&#8208;Nucleophiles Catalyzed by a Chiral Sc(III)/bipyridine Complex</title>
      <dc:description>The ring&#8208;opening of epoxides is a synthetically significant process widely applied in all kinds of chemistry. Herein, we report the catalytic and highly enantioselective variant of this reaction exploiting our recent endeavors to design and synthesize chiral bipyridine type ligands. A Sc&#8208;complex with a newly developed bipyridine ligand exhibited high reactivity and stereocontrol in the desymmetrization of  meso  &#8208;epoxides with various alcohols. The respective enantiomerically enriched 1,2&#8208;alkoxyalcohols were obtained with e.rs up to 99.5:0.5 for various alcohols regardless of their nature (benzyl, alkyl, cycloalkyl, allyl, propargyl, etc.). We attempted ring&#8208;opening of  meso  &#8208;epoxides with anilines as well; however, it proceeded with lower enantioselectivity and strongly depended on the electronic effect of substituents attached to the aromatic ring.</dc:description>

      <title>Novel, Chiral, and Enantiopure C2&#8208;symmetric Thioureas Promote Asymmetric Protio&#8208;Pictet&#8211;Spengler Reactions by Anion&#8208;Binding Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Although anion&#8208;binding processes are well&#8208;known for their crucial role in molecular recognition, they have only recently been utilized for catalysis. Herein, a new class of chiral, enantiopure C  2  &#8208;symmetrical thioureas that, in combination with 4&#8208;methoxybenzoic acid, promotes the enantioselective protio&#8208;Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction to provide unprotected tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines in good yields (40&#8211;93%) and moderate&#8208;to&#8208;high enantioselectivities (34&#8211;95% ee) in one step from tryptamine and aldehyde derivatives is described. The formation of a chiral catalyst&#8208;anion complex was explored by  1  H NMR.</dc:description>

      <title>Non&#8208;Canonical Reactivity of Gold Carbene with Alkyne: An Overview of the Mechanistic Premise</title>
      <dc:description>The unique nature of gold carbene and its synchronous counterpart gold&#8208;stabilized carbocation, is mainly responsible for the non&#8208;canonical reactivity profile that it demonstrates in comparison to any other transition metal carbene. Being an important subset to this class, reactions of gold carbene with alkyne sponsor products far more diverse than cyclopropenation as canonically expected in case of other transition metal carbenes. These gold&#8208;catalyzed reactions have largely been proposed to follow either a [1,n]&#8208;carbene transfer process or an alternate pathway involving a direct interception of the b&#8208;gold vinyl cation with a nucleophile at the cationic carbon. Despite of a clear distinction in structure, bonding and energy of a vinyl gold carbene and b&#8208;gold vinyl cation; they have been found to exhibit identical reactivities like cyclopropenation, C(sp  2  )&#8208;H insertion, etc. making it extremely difficult to &#8220;experimentally&#8221; investigate and validate a mechanistic pathway. It is because of these lacking conclusive experimental evidence in addition to the limited number of detailed computational studies that multiple pathways have been proposed simultaneously to rationalize the product formation. As an effort to shed light on the mechanisms of these reactions, herein, documentation of these reactions with a focus on their mechanistic premise has been presented.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis, self&#8208;assembly and nucleic acid recognition of an acylhydrazone&#8208;conjugated cationic tetraphenylethene ligand</title>
      <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers are of interest in the pursuit of multivalent nucleic acids recognition. However, their formation often relies on non&#8208;covalent forces that are also at play in the interaction with nucleic acids. In this work, we designed a novel compound (  TPE&#8208;Gir  ) combining a tetraphenylethene aromatic core tethered to four quaternary ammoniums through acylhydrazone spacers, and we investigated in details its self&#8208;assembly and interaction with different types of nucleic acids. The spectroscopic analyses indicate the self&#8208;assembly of regular fluorescent nanoparticles (observed by DLS and TEM) in the absence of nucleic acids, the strong propensity to intercalate into single&#8208;stranded DNA, the ability to bind into the minor groove of double&#8208;stranded DNA, and the selective binding to G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures by fitting within a wide G4&#8208;groove. Those recognition events are quantified by isothermal titration calorimetry and the proposed binding models are supported by docking simulations.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The enantioselective synthesis of zealexin A1, a sesquiterpene phytoalexin isolated from maize  Zea mays  is described for the first time. Our methodology for the total synthesis of zealexin A1 involved the stereoselective construction of the stereogenic center via enzymatic resolution followed by Johnson&#8722;Claisen rearrangement. The absolute configuration of the natural product was determined through gas chromatography analyses for the methyl esters for both synthetic and natural zealexin A1.</dc:description>

Our methodology for the total synthesis of zealexin A1 involved the stereoselective construction of the stereogenic center via enzymatic resolution followed by Johnson&#8722;Claisen rearrangement. The absolute configuration of the natural product was determined through gas chromatography analyses for the methyl esters for both synthetic and natural zealexin A1.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>We have developed a two&#8208;step protocol for iodotrimethylsilane&#8208;mediated deoxy&#8208;functionalization of primary and secondary alcohols to afford products containing a C&#8211;N, C&#8211;S, or C&#8211;O bond.

Compared with the traditional Mitsunobu reaction, this reaction has a wider substrate scope. In addition, non&#8208;acidic pre&#8208;nucleophiles can be used, and the reaction proceeds with retention of configuration. This operationally simple, highly efficient protocol can be used for late&#8208;stage derivatization of hydroxy&#8208;group containing natural products and drugs.</dc:description>

      <title>The Chemistry of High&#8208;Oxidation State Securinega Alkaloids</title>
      <dc:description>Securinega alkaloids have fascinated the chemical community for over six decades. Among these intriguing secondary metabolites, there are members that are biosynthesized via oxidation(s) of the basic tetracyclic core of securinega natural products. These oxidation processes result in a sub&#8208;family of natural products with intriguing structural variations. We have grouped them as &#8220;high&#8208;oxidation state&#8221; securinega alkaloids. In this minireview, we, for the first time, categorize high&#8208;oxidation state securinega alkaloids into five groups based on their structural phenotype. We then describe all known syntheses of high&#8208;oxidation state securinega alkaloids based on our classification. Plausible biosynthetic origins of securinega alkaloids in each group are described. Notable interplays between chemical synthesis and biosynthesis within this family of natural products are depicted. The updated comprehensive investigation of the chemistry of high&#8208;oxidation state securinega alkaloids provides us with an outlook on remaining key challenges related to these fascinating natural products.</dc:description>

Abstract
A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed, site&#8208;selective, C&#8722;H alkylation of quinoline N&#8208;oxides at C8 using bench&#8208;stable and commercially available diazo Meldrum's acid is reported. This straightforward protocol employs a widely available catalyst and enables the synthesis of a variety of 8&#8208;quinolinylacetic acid esters on gram scale without necessitating the preparation and use of an excess of air&#8208;sensitive organometallic reagents.

      <title>Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Annulation of Amidines with Alkynes via Sequential C&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>
      <dc:description>In this paper, rhodium&#8208;catalyzed sequential twofold ortho &#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization of N &#8208;phenylbenzimidamide with internal alkyne is studied. The double C&#8208;H activations proved viable in a one&#8208;pot fashion with the assistance of C=N and C&#8208;N, providing a serial of benzimidazoisoquinolines with high levels of positional selectivity control. The operationally simple transformation showed high functional group compatibility and featured with cleavage of the C&#8208;H bonds located on different moiety of the N &#8208;phenylbenzimidamide substrates. Detailed mechanistic studies provided strong support for C&#8722;H bond cleavage on N &#8208;phenyl ring is preferential than C&#8208;H bond on C&#8208;phenyl ring. As a multifunctional catalytic platform, the rhodium catalyst conducted two independent and compatible catalytic cycles in one pot.</dc:description>

      <title>Design, Synthesis, and Evaluation of &#945;&#8208;(Hydroxymethyl)cycloalkanols</title>
      <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;(Hydroxymethyl)cycloalkanol derivatives are raising increasing interest due to their robustness and their biological and chemical applications. This review takes an overview of the literature for the occurrence and synthesis of such derivatives, concentrating on advances in the last two decades.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;(Hydroxymethyl)cycloalkanols are pervasive structural scaffolds found in natural products and synthetic intermediates with varied biochemical and physicochemical properties. These profiles have driven numerous research groups to the synthesis of such motifs using innovative methodologies. The presence of vicinal diols attached to a cycloalkane makes from these motifs excellent synthetic intermediates for the synthesis of diverse ring systems. This investigation takes an overview of the literature for the occurrence and synthesis of &#945;&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)cycloalkanol derivatives, concentrating on advances in the last two decades.

      <title>Trimodular solution phase protocol for rapid large&#8208;scale synthesis of hydrogen bond surrogate&#8208;constrained &#945;&#8208;helicomimics</title>
      <dc:description>Scalability, optimal reagent usage, high yields, easy isolation and cost&#8208;effectiveness, are key for the applicability of synthetic methodologies in production of potential therapeutics. Hydrogen bond surrogate (HBS) constrained &#945;&#8208;helical peptides (&#945;&#8208;helicomimics) have shown promise as therapeutics based on their efficiency to interfere with protein&#8208;biomolecular interactions. The propyl HBS&#8208;constrained &#945;&#8208;helicomimics have shown highest helicities in both single turn and extended, &#945;&#8208;helices (ST&#945;H, E&#945;H). Here we present a solution phase synthetic (SPS) method, for the rapid, large scale, low cost synthesis of libraries of ST&#945;H and E&#945;H in high yields. The key to the efficiency is our trimodular (M  1  , M  2  , M  3  ) synthetic protocol where M  1  is a library of HBS&#8208;linked peptidomimetic synthons of both ST&#945;H and E&#945;H; M  2  and M  3  are desired oligopeptide libraries. Advantages of the trimodular method over conventional unimodular methods are demonstrated through synthesis of large&#8208;scale libraries of M  1  , ST&#945;H and E&#945;H.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of natural compounds based on the [3,7]&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (bispidine) core</title>
      <dc:description>The [3,7]&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (bispidine) structure is found in several interesting natural occurring alkaloids. The most representative components are the tetracyclic alkaloid (&#8208;)&#8208;sparteine and the tricyclic (&#8208;)&#8208;cytisine alkaloids. Their biological activities have been known for a long time. In the literature, different syntheses of both tetracyclic and tricyclic structures have been reported, especially in the last few years, when a number of new reports has witnessed a renewed interest in these fascinating molecules. Bicyclic bispidine derivatives have been thoroughly investigated in recent times also for their applications as catalysts, metal chelating agents and lately in coordination polymers chemistry. In this review, we describe the most relevant strategies for the synthesis of molecules based on the [3,7]&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core, related to (&#8208;)&#8208;sparteine and (&#8208;)&#8208;cytisine alkaloids.</dc:description>

A divergent Hyp scission&#8208;reductive amination process was carried out, affording five linear peptides with cationic residues, and remarkably, a  N  &#8208;alkyl moiety that hindered rotation. After two steps (saponification and macrocyclization), sixteen differently  N1  &#8208;substituted linear and cyclic peptides were obtained. For the first time, the activity of the linear and cyclic compounds was compared.

      <title>Nickel and Palladium&#8208;catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aryl Fluorosulfonates and Phosphites: Preparation of Aryl phosphonates</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of aryl phosphonates via nickel and palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of aryl fluorosulfonates and phosphites is described. The products were obtained in good to excellent yields under mild conditions with broad functional group compatibility, employing either Pd(OAc)  2  and DPEPhos or the readily available NiCl  2  (dme) and Xantphos as catalytic systems.

      <title>"On&#8208;resin" disulfide peptide synthesis with methyl 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinesulfenate</title>
      <dc:description>New methodologies for the construction of full peptide structures with all disulfide bonds on the resin are attractive for the development of solid phase peptide synthesis. Detailed reaction conditions for the on&#8208;resin disulfide bond formation have been investigated using a mild and chemically stable oxidizing reagent, methyl 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinesulfenate (Npys&#8208;OMe). Monocyclic oxytocin, MCH and bicyclic &#945;&#8208;conotoxin ImI were synthesized in both semi&#8208;automated and full&#8208;automated protocols. It was found that on&#8208;resin intramolecular disulfide bond formation with Npys&#8208;OMe proceeds with the minimal formation of peptide oligomers by adopting a solvent system with 0.4 M LiCl/DMF. Crude peptides with complete disulfide bond patterns can be obtained in high purity in both protocols. This minimized the RP&#8208;HPLC purification step and the desired peptides were obtained with better yields. To our knowledge, this is the first fully automated construction of a bicyclic disulfide peptide on resin with more than 50% purity in Fmoc&#8208;based SPPS. These results suggest that Npys&#8208;OMe is a useful reagent for the disulfide bond formation in automated protocols.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Reactions of a novel propyne iminium salt,  N  ,  N  &#8208;dimethyl 3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;propyne iminium triflate, with electron&#8208;rich heteroaromatic ring systems (furans, thiophenes, pyrroles) are reported. The 1&#8208;CF  3  &#8208;propyne iminium ion can act as a highly reactive ambident electrophile, giving rise to simple electrophilic heteroaromatic ring substitution products, and as a 1,3&#8208;biselectrophile leading to C  2  + C  3  &#8208;CF  3  annulation products. Moreover, it is an electron&#8208;deficient alkyne which was found to afford double [2+2] cycloaddition products with 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran and 2,5&#8208;dimethylthiophene. The molecular structures so obtained include CF  3  &#8208;containing compounds with cyclopenta[  b  ]furan, cyclopenta[  b  ]thiophene, cyclopenta[  c  ]thiophene, cyclopenta[  b  ]pyrrole, cyclopenta[  c  ]pyrrole, 3  H  &#8208;pyrrolizine and 1,4&#8208;dihydrocyclopenta[  b  ]pyrrole ring systems. Analogous reactions of 1,3(or 1,4)&#8208;phenylenebis(1&#8208;CF  3  &#8208;propyne iminium) salts with furans, pyrroles or thiophenes in a 2:1 stoichiometry lead to phenylene&#8208;tethered condensed heterocycles of the same type.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reactions of a novel propyne iminium salt,  N  ,  N  &#8208;dimethyl 3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;propyne iminium triflate, with electron&#8208;rich heteroaromatic ring systems (furans, thiophenes, pyrroles) are reported. The 1&#8208;CF  3  &#8208;propyne iminium ion can act as a highly reactive ambident electrophile, giving rise to simple electrophilic heteroaromatic ring substitution products, and as a 1,3&#8208;biselectrophile leading to C  2  + C  3  &#8208;CF  3  annulation products. Moreover, it is an electron&#8208;deficient alkyne which was found to afford double [2+2] cycloaddition products with 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran and 2,5&#8208;dimethylthiophene. The molecular structures so obtained include CF  3  &#8208;containing compounds with cyclopenta[  b  ]furan, cyclopenta[  b  ]thiophene, cyclopenta[  c  ]thiophene, cyclopenta[  b  ]pyrrole, cyclopenta[  c  ]pyrrole, 3  H  &#8208;pyrrolizine and 1,4&#8208;dihydrocyclopenta[  b  ]pyrrole ring systems. Analogous reactions of 1,3(or 1,4)&#8208;phenylenebis(1&#8208;CF  3  &#8208;propyne iminium) salts with furans, pyrroles or thiophenes in a 2:1 stoichiometry lead to phenylene&#8208;tethered condensed heterocycles of the same type.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Recent developments in deaminative functionalization of alkyl amines</title>
      <dc:description>The amino group is one of the most prevalent functional groups present in a wide range of organic molecules, which has been widely applied in various organic synthesis and pharmaceuticals. Alkyl amines could be converted in a single step into Katritzky salts which could serve as alkyl radical precursors to construct C&#8208;C bonds and C&#8208;X bonds via C(sp  3  )&#8208;N cleavage. This deaminative functionalization could be carried out under transition&#8208;metal catalysis, photocatalysis, carbene catalysis or base. In this paper, recent developments in the deaminative functionalization of alkyl amines were covered. This review was categorized into four parts according to the nature of the bond formation.

      <title>Reaction of N,N&#8208;Disubstituted Polyfluoroalkanethioamides with Diazomethane: Entry to New Thiirane Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4&#8208;dioxane derivatives are discussed.






New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between N,N&#8208;disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

     alt="Reaction of N,N&#8208;Disubstituted Polyfluoroalkanethioamides with Diazomethane: Entry to New Thiirane Derivatives"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4&#8208;dioxane derivatives are discussed.
&lt;/p&gt;
