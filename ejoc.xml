         <title>Amino&#8208;Acid&#8208;Encoded Enantioselective Photocatalysis in Self&#8208;Assembled Porphyrin&#8211;Amino Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the excellent photocatalytic ability of porphyrin and the chiral advantage of amino acids, porphyrin has been modified using amino acids. The porphyrin&#8211;amino acids can exhibit opposite trends in enantioselectivity in the photocatalytic oxidation of tyrosine reaction. Moreover, the porphyrin&#8211;phenylalanine derivatives with carboxyl&#8208;terminal groups catalyze 700.10% more dityrosine in d&#8208;type substrates than in l&#8208;type substrates.

Porphyrin&#8208;based nanomaterials have attracted much attention in photocatalysis due to their excellent photoelectrocatalytic ability and strong intermolecular interaction forces. Herein, a series of chiral assemblies of porphyrin&#8211;amino acid derivatives are prepared by linking different types of amino acids with terminal modifications to tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin via covalent bonding and their catalytic ability in enantioselective photocatalytic oxidation of tyrosine is investigated. The results show that the amino acid type and terminal groups significantly affect the macroscopic assembly morphology and microscopic chiral space of the porphyrin&#8211;amino acid derivatives, which is consistent with the results of molecular dynamics simulations and further impacts the rate and enantioselectivity of tyrosine chiral photocatalytic oxidation. These results provide new avenues for applying porphyrin derivatives in chiral photocatalysis.

A facile amination reaction has been developed of unprotected 6&#8208;Cl purine and various bioactive amine derivatives under catalyst&#8208;free, solvent&#8208;free condition. Further, one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole attached unprotected hybrid nucleosides is shown.

An efficient catalyst&#8208;free, solvent&#8208;free amination reaction has been developed for the synthesis of various bioinspired 6&#8208;substituted aminopurine nucleoside analogs in good yields. In this sustainable approach, unprotected 6&#8208;substituted aminopurine nucleoside analogs are synthesized via amination reactions of unprotected 6&#8208;Cl purine nucleosides with various amine derivatives. Notably, the method offers a simple, eco&#8208;friendly, unifying protocol for the synthesis of various bioinspired molecules with highly functional group tolerance. Additionally, to demonstrate its synthetic applicability, a one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component reaction protocol &#160;has been shown for the synthesis of novel 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;attached hybrid nucleosides containing various drug core moieties via click chemistry.

         <title>Organic photocatalyst Eosin Y catalyzes the formation of C&#8208;S bonds under visible light</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of green and efficient C&#8208;S bond formation methods has received significant attention from synthetic chemists because the C&#8208;S bonds widely occurs in many important drugs and natural biological compounds. In recent years, photochemical organic conversion promoted by visible light has attracted the interest of many organic chemists. Compared with the traditional methods, visible light as the photoredox catalysis of renewable energy has been proved to be a mild and powerful tool that can promote the activation of organic molecules through the single electron transfer (SET) process. Therefore, this strategy has been widely applied in the formation of C&#8208;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. This article reviews the research results on the formation of carbon sulfur bond promoted by organic photocatalyst Eosin Y under visible light in recent years, and discusses representative examples and reaction mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective C&#8208;H Amination of Lupane&#8208;Type Triterpenoids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A synthetic protocol for rhodium&#8208;catalyzed, site selective C&#8208;H amination of the betulin scaffold has been developed. Under catalytic conditions, betulin&#8208;derived 28&#8208;O&#8208;sulfamate ester undergoes intramolecular C&#8208;H amination to afford 1,2,3&#8208;oxathiazinane&#8208;2,2&#8208;dione&#8208;fused lupane triterpenoids with a C16/C22 selectivity ratio 9:1. Introduction of a C16&#8208;substituent enables a second sequential C&#8208;H amination, which occurs with C22 selectivity. Betulin&#8208;derived oxathiazinanes can be cleaved and the ring&#8208;opened products provide straightforward access to 16&#8208;amino&#8208; and 16&#8208;azido&#8208;betulin, 16&#8208;amino&#8208;betulinic and 16&#8208;amino&#8208;betulonic acids. Betulin analogs with selectively introduced amine and azide functionalities are versatile building blocks for further medicinal chemistry applications in semi&#8208;synthetic triterpenoid series.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Atropisomeric Diarylamines Enabled by Bromine&#8208;Masked Indolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the use of a bromine atom as a masking group for the synthesis atropisomeric diarylamines via N&#8208;arylation of 7&#8208;bromoindolines. The bromine atom acts as a bulky group to temporarily stabilize the configuration by steric hindrance. Upon unmasking, less sterically hindered diarylamines are obtained, with configurational stability potentially maintained through intramolecular hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
Herein, we report the use of a bromine atom as a masking group for the synthesis atropisomeric diarylamines via organocatalytic N&#8208;arylation of 7&#8208;bromoindolines. The bromine atom acts as a bulky group to temporarily stabilize the configuration by steric hindrance. Upon unmasking, less sterically hindered diarylamines are obtained, with configurational stability potentially maintained through intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Moreover, the gram&#8208;scale reaction and post&#8208;modifications of the axially chiral diarylamines demonstrated the utility of this protocol. Thermal racemization experiments combined with X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed the respective contributions of steric repulsion and intramolecular hydrogen bonding in stabilizing the configurations. This approach not only provides a useful method for the atroposelective construction of conical diarylamines, but also paves the way for a better understanding of stable axial chirality and its role in shaping chemical reactivity and biological activity.

         <title>Sunlight&#8208;Driven, Catalyst&#8208;Free Synthesis of Cyclobutanes by [2+2] Cycloaddition of Fluorinated Heterochalconoids in Solution</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cyclobutane ring constitutes an interesting scaffold for the development of new materials and drugs. In this work we describe the [2+2] cycloaddition of chalconoid precursors bearing fluorinated and heterocyclic moieties to produce cyclobutane derivatives in solution. The reaction is promoted by sunlight and does not require any added photocatalyst. The regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity output depends on the heteroaromatic system and the number of fluorine atoms. Experimental results and DFT calculations support a mechanism through the formation of an EDA complex between two molecules of the chalconoid.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure of Geminal Diol&#8211;Type Intermediates and Their Reactivity in Modern Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gem&#8208;diols, as crucial intermediates in organic reactions, have been characterized using advanced analytical methodologies. This concept systematically examines the thermodynamic stability and synthetic accessibility of gem&#8208;diol&#8208;type structures, focusing on their reactivity in organic synthesis and their utility in mechanistic studies.

Geminal diol (gem&#8208;diol) moieties commonly exist in equilibrium with ketones or aldehydes when water is present in the system. While significant progress has been made in their structural characterization, recent studies have increasingly focused on the reactivity of gem&#8208;diol intermediates. In parallel, gem&#8208;diol&#8208;type hydroxyl&#8208;oxoammonium species have been reported as key intermediates in various reactions. Accordingly, this concept highlights recent advances in the structural elucidation of gem&#8208;diol&#8208;type intermediates and, more importantly, discusses their reactivity and potential application in organic reactions. In addition to typical gem&#8208;diol species, the discussion also encompasses other gem&#8208;diol&#8208;type species with O&#63743;C(sp3)&#63743;O or O&#63743;N(sp3)&#63743;O centers derived from C(sp2)&#63742;O or N(sp2)&#63742;O centers, respectively. The ultimate aim is to inspire the development of more efficient strategies for employing such gem&#8208;diol&#8208;type intermediates in organic synthesis.

         <title>Recent Advances in Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed/Mediated C&#63743;SCF3 Bond Formation Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review (2014&#8211;2024) explores transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed strategies for C&#63743;X trifluoromethylthiolation (SCF3), a pharmacologically critical group with unique electronic and lipophilic properties. Three approaches are systematically analyzed: directing group&#8208;enabled C&#63743;H activation, cross&#8208;coupling methodologies, and light&#8208;assisted transition metal catalysis. Mechanistic insights, substrate adaptability, and current limitations are critically evaluated, emphasizing advances in the field of constructing C&#8208;SCF3 bond.

The trifluoromethylthiolated group (SCF3) is characterized by its strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability, excellent lipophilicity, good stability, and bioavailability, making it highly relevant for applications in drug design and development. This review summarizes recent advances in C&#63743;X (H, Cl, OTf, B(OH)2) trifluoromethylthiolation reaction from 2014 to 2024. The discussion is organized into three major sections: 1) transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H trifluoromethylthiolation reactions facilitated by directing groups, 2) transition metal&#8208;catalyzed trifluoromethylthiolation via cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and 3) light&#8208;assisted transition metal&#8208;catalyzed trifluoromethylthiolation reactions. Additionally, this review examines the substrate scope, limitations, and partial mechanisms associated with these transformations.

         <title>Bis&#8208;Tetrasubstituted Centers Forming Formal [3&#8201;+&#8201;3] Cycloaddition Reaction via Bifunctional Organocatalysis: Synthesis of Spiro&#8208;Oxindoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method has been developed for Michael/electrophilic substitution cascade reaction via bifunctional organocatalysis to synthesize a diverse array of spiro&#8208;oxindole derivatives bearing bis&#8208;tetrasubstituted carbon centers, achieving high yields and exceptional diastereoselectivities. This strategy, in conjunction with traditional metal catalysis, facilitates the switchable, chemodivergent synthesis of spiro&#8208;oxindoles.

An efficient method has been developed for Michael/electrophilic substitution cascade reaction between 3&#8208;pyrrolyl&#8208;oxindoles and unsaturated ketoesters, utilizing bifunctional organocatalysis. This approach enables the synthesis of a diverse array of spiro&#8208;oxindole derivatives bearing three stereogenic centers, two of them quaternary, achieving high yields and exceptional diastereoselectivities. Furthermore, the resulting products can be readily converted into tetrahydropyridine skeletons through an elimination process in one pot. This strategy, in conjunction with traditional metal catalysis, facilitates the switchable, chemodivergent synthesis of spiro&#8208;oxindoles, offering significant synthetic flexibility and potential for broader applications.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;free Three&#8208;Component Halophosphorothiolation of Enamides/Enoates for Regioselective Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Halogenated Phosphorothioates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and practical strategy for catalyst&#8208;free, three&#8208;component regioselective phosphorothiolation&#8208;halogenation of enamides/enoates is reported, enabling the synthesis of diverse amide/ester&#8208; and halogen&#8208;containing phosphorothioates in high yields. In addition, chlorophosphorothiolated amides can further undergo intramolecular cyclization to access phosphorothioated lactams. All of the tested compounds demonstrate potent and selective inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase.

A three&#8208;component regioselective phosphorothiolation&#8208;halogenation of enamides/enoates with P(O)SH compounds and NXS (X&#8201;=&#8201;Cl, Br) under catalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free conditions has been demonstrated. This strategy readily affords an array of valuable amide/ester&#8208; and halogen&#8208;containing phosphorothioates in good to excellent yields, featuring simple operations, diverse functional group tolerance, and easy scale&#8208;up. Preliminary studies reveal that the electrophilic phosphoranesulfenyl chlorides/bromides generated in&#8201;situ may be a key intermediate. Furthermore, phosphorothioated lactams can be easily obtained through the intramolecular substitution reaction of chlorophosphorothiolated amides. Notably, all of the tested products displayed potent and selective inhibitory activity toward butyrylcholinesterase.

         <title>Insight on p&#8208;Acetoxybenzyl Carbonate as an Orthogonal Hydroxyl Protecting Group in Oligosaccharide Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new protecting group can be easily installed in one synthetic step and selectively removed by using catalytic amounts of ytterbium(III) triflate at room temperature. Moreover, this new protecting group is orthogonal with tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS), p&#8208;methoxybenzyl (PMB), acetonides, and benzylidenes groups. Finally, the new protecting group is applied to oligosaccharide synthesis to prove their stability under glycosylation conditions.

This study describes the utility of p&#8208;acetoxybenzyl carbonate (ABC) group for the protection of hydroxyl functions. This hydroxyl protecting group can be easily prepared using inexpensive commercially available 4&#8208;hydroxybenzyl alcohol as the starting material. The ABC group can be selectively removed through ytterbium(III) triflate&#8208;catalyzed transesterification at room temperature without affecting commonly used acid&#8208;cleavable protecting groups, such as tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS), p&#8208;methoxybenzyl (PMB), acetonide, and benzylidenes. Notably, the ABC protecting group is stable under glycosylation conditions in oligosaccharide synthesis.

         <dc:description>
Bicyclo[1.1.0]butane derivatives are a class of strained electrophiles. A variety of carboxamide derivatives of these electrophiles are converted under palladium catalysis into a series of 3&#8208;allylindolin&#8208;2&#8208;one products. The moderate&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields and the broad substrate scope indicate that this reaction is a highly appealing strategy

As a novel class of reactive electrophiles, bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCB) remain relatively underexplored. Herein, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes is disclosed that provides a variety of 3&#8208;allylindolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields with very good functional group tolerance. This protocol features mild reaction conditions and broad substrate scope.

     alt="Synthesis of Substituted 3-Allyl-1-Methylindolin-2-Ones by Palladium-Catalyzed Cyclization of N-(2-Iodophenyl)-N-Methylbicyclo[1.1.0]Butane-1-Carboxamides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bicyclo[1.1.0]butane derivatives are a class of strained electrophiles. A variety of carboxamide derivatives of these electrophiles are converted under palladium catalysis into a series of 3-allylindolin-2-one products. The moderate-to-excellent yields and the broad substrate scope indicate that this reaction is a highly appealing strategy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a novel class of reactive electrophiles, bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCB) remain relatively underexplored. Herein, a palladium-catalyzed reaction of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes is disclosed that provides a variety of 3-allylindolin-2-ones in moderate-to-excellent yields with very good functional group tolerance. This protocol features mild reaction conditions and broad substrate scope.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photochemical Synthesis of 2,6&#8208;Linked Anthracene Oligomers without Introducing Extra Substituents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoconvertible precursors of 2,6&#8208;linked anthracene oligomers (trimer, tetramer, and pentamer) were synthesized through repeated Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Upon exposure of these precursors to light at 450 nm, which correspond to the n&#8211;&#960;* transition of diketone moieties, yellow precipitates were formed, suggesting the conversion to the corresponding anthracene oligomers from the precursors. The disappearance of 1H NMR peaks after photoirradiation indicated the formation of anthracene oligomers with less solubility. High&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry evidently indicated the oligomer formations, and infrared spectral analysis for thin films showed the disappearance of peaks originating from the carbonyl groups, also supporting the conversion. The absorption spectra after photoirradiation indicated a red&#8208;shift in the absorption peaks accompanying oligomer formations, suggesting an extension of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. The low solubility of the resulting anthracene oligomers in organic solvents highlights the effectiveness of this synthetic strategy using the photoconvertible precursor. This study provides a practical method to synthesize acene oligomers without the introduction of extra substituents.</dc:description>

         <title>Amphiphilic Fluoro&#8208;Functionalized Cellulosic Materials: Synthesis, Characterization, and Organic Dye Adsorption Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 20, May 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
New amphiphilic fluoro&#8208;functionalized cellulosic materials are being yielded through nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Covalent attachment of fluorinated moiety into biopolymers is being&#160;assured with full characterization. Fluoro&#8208;functionalized materials are being incorporated in alginate beads to remove organic pollutants from wastewater. Functionalization is leading to a three&#8208; to eightfold increase in the dye&#8208;removal efficiency, the resulting functionalized&#8208;beads can be also easily recycled .

The growing interest toward biopolymers application in amphiphilic conditions prompts one to explore the preparation of fluorinated cellulosic materials. Cellulose (CE) and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) are functionalized with highly fluorinated pendants, through a nucleophilic aromatic substitution on 3&#8208;pentadecafluoroheptyl&#8208;5&#8208;pentafluorophenyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole (FOX) leading to the corresponding fluorinated biopolymers CE&#8208;FOX and CMC&#8208;FOX. Structural and thermal stability confirm covalent attachment of the fluorinated moiety onto the cellulosic skeleton and highlighted an interesting 2D texture of the CMC&#8208;FOX material. Hybrid and amphiphilic features of CE&#8208;FOX and CMC&#8208;FOX, are confirmed by water and oil contact angle measurements. Applications as adsorbent material for organic contaminants from an aqueous solution are tested by previously incorporating the functional biopolymer into sodium alginate (SA) hydrogel beads. Rhodamine B (RhB) is used as a model wastewater pollutant. Fluoro&#8208;functionalization led to a three&#8208; to eightfold increase in the dye&#8208;removal efficiency of the SA&#8208;incorporated biopolymer with respect to the corresponding non&#8208;fluorinated material (from 11% to 48% for SA/CE vs SA/CE&#8208;FOX beads and from 11% to 94% for SA/CMC vs SA/CMC&#8208;FOX beads). Recyclability tests show good residual performance of SA/CMC&#8208;FOX beads after seven desorption/reuse cycles opening the way to more sustainable adsorbing processes for the removal of emerging pollutants from contaminated water.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Component Domino Strategy for Regioselective Synthesis of Tetrahydrothiochromen&#8208;5&#8208;ones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 20, May 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silica&#8208;supported sulfuric acid&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component domino strategy involving &#946;&#8208; oxodithioesters, aromatic aldehydes and 1,3&#8208;cyclohexanediones has been developed for the regioselective synthesis of tetrahydro&#8208;5H&#8208;thiochromen&#8208;5&#8208;ones under solvent&#8208;free conditions. The reaction proceeded through the construction of two new C&#8722;C and one C&#8722;S bonds in a single step to afford high product yields.







Abstract
A sustainable one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;component domino strategy for the regioselective synthesis of tetrahydrothiochromen&#8208;5&#8208;ones has been developed using inexpensive, stable, and recyclable silica&#8208;supported sulfuric acid as the heterogeneous catalyst under solvent&#8208;free conditions. This strategy enabled us to access a diverse range of valuable tetrahydrothiochromen&#8208;5&#8208;ones up to a 93&#8201;% yield via annulation of &#946;&#8208;oxodithioesters with aromatic aldehydes and 1,3&#8208;cyclohexanediones. Furthermore, the catalyst was efficiently recovered, recycled, and reused for four cycles without a significant loss of catalytic activity, thus demonstrating the robustness of the devised methodology and its potential applicability in sustainable organic synthesis of the protocol.

     alt="Multi-Component Domino Strategy for Regioselective Synthesis of Tetrahydrothiochromen-5-ones"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A silica-supported sulfuric acid-catalyzed three-component domino strategy involving &#946;- oxodithioesters, aromatic aldehydes and 1,3-cyclohexanediones has been developed for the regioselective synthesis of tetrahydro-5H-thiochromen-5-ones under solvent-free conditions. The reaction proceeded through the construction of two new C&#8722;C and one C&#8722;S bonds in a single step to afford high product yields.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sustainable one-pot multi-component domino strategy for the regioselective synthesis of tetrahydrothiochromen-5-ones has been developed using inexpensive, stable, and recyclable silica-supported sulfuric acid as the heterogeneous catalyst under solvent-free conditions. This strategy enabled us to access a diverse range of valuable tetrahydrothiochromen-5-ones up to a 93&#8201;% yield &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; annulation of &#946;-oxodithioesters with aromatic aldehydes and 1,3-cyclohexanediones. Furthermore, the catalyst was efficiently recovered, recycled, and reused for four cycles without a significant loss of catalytic activity, thus demonstrating the robustness of the devised methodology and its potential applicability in sustainable organic synthesis of the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Coupling of Polyfluoroarenes with Acylsilanes Under Metal&#8208;Free Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 20, May 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct coupling of polyfluoroarenes with acylsilanes in the presence of a catalytic amount of a strong base under exceptionally mild conditions has been realized. This reaction proceeds directly without the needs for photoirradiation and a metal catalyst, and features mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, and significant potentials for preparing fluorinated bioactive molecules.







Abstract
The installation of polyfluoroaryl group in functional molecules is of interest due to the presence of polyfluoroarenes in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and advanced materials. Herein, we report the direct coupling of polyfluoroarenes with acylsilanes for synthesis of fluorinated benzylic alcohols in the presence of a catalytic base. This reaction could tolerate a wide range of polyfluoroarenes and polyfluoroheteroarenes, providing an efficient entry to fluoroarylated compounds. Deuteration experiments showed that the hydrogen source in the product was mainly from the polyfluoroarenes. The utility of this method was demonstrated by the derivatization of the product and the synthesis of a fluorinated analogue with antituberculous activity.

         <title>Improved Total Synthesis of Millepachine through a Negishi Acylative Cross&#8208;Coupling Protocol</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 20, May 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study of the acylative Negishi cross&#8208;coupling between 4&#8208;methoxycinnamoyl chloride and the suitable chromenic organozinc halide allows to develop a new protocol for the total synthesis of Millepachine, which gives the target product in improved overall yield, starting from 3&#8208;methoxyphenol.

The chalcone Millepachine exhibits interesting biological properties, such as cytotoxic and antitumor activity against various cancer cells. Despite these characteristics, the only published synthesis gives the product in modest yield. Herein, a study on the acylative Negishi cross&#8208;coupling for obtaining Millepachine in higher yield is presented. Both iodo&#8208; and bromo&#8208;2H&#8208;chromene derivatives, as precursors of the organozinc halides, are synthesized and different routes for obtaining the organometallic species are explored. The transmetalation from the aryllithium proves to be the most efficient method to obtain a reactive organozinc species for the Negishi cross&#8208;coupling with 4&#8208;methoxycynnamoyl chloride. Up to 75% yield of pure product is obtained corresponding to 43% overall yield from commercially available 3&#8208;methoxyphenol.

Synthesis, absorption and fluorescence spectra, and quantum yields of a series of oxazolo[5,4&#8208;b]quinolines are reported. The oxazolo[5,4&#8208;b]quinolines were synthesized via a two&#8208;step process involving the reaction of 4&#8208;trifluoroacetylazlactones with various substituted anilines, followed by intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization and Robinson&#8208;Gabriel oxazole formation.







Abstract
A series of oxazolo[5,4&#8208;b]quinoline derivatives were synthesized via a two&#8208;step process involving the reaction of 4&#8208;trifluoroacetylazlactones with various substituted anilines, followed by intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization and Robinson&#8208;Gabriel oxazole formation. The systematic investigation of the photophysical properties of the synthesized compounds revealed that the position and nature of the substituents on the oxazolo[5,4&#8208;b]quinoline core significantly influenced the absorption and emission characteristics. The 6,8&#8208;dimethoxy substitution pattern was found to provide an optimal balance between high fluorescence quantum yield and moderate Stokes shift, whereas the 5,8&#8208;dimethoxy substitution offered a unique combination of large Stokes shift and long wavelength emission. Additionally, the presence of a trifluoromethyl group at the C&#8208;9 position was identified as a crucial structural feature for maintaining strong fluorescence. These structure&#8208;property relationships provide valuable insights for the rational design of novel fluorescent oxazolo[5,4&#8208;b]quinoline derivatives with tailored photophysical properties, which could find potential applications in the development of fluorescent probes and organic light&#8208;emitting materials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A method for synthesizing indolo-fused 3-sulfenylpyrazolo[1,5-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]pyrimidines has been developed through a one-pot, iodine-mediated domino reaction using indole-3-carbaldehydes, 3-aminopyrazoles and dichalcogenides or thiophenols. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds through a radical pathway during the C&#8722;S bond formation, with an iodonium ion intermediate driving the cyclization step. Additionally, some products exhibit significant antitumor activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrosilylation of Terminal Alkenes Catalyzed by a Scandium Metalloligand Supported Ni(0) Complex</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 20, May 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrosilylation of terminal alkenes catalyzed by a scandium metalloligand supported zero&#8208;valent nickel complex is reported. The resting&#8208;state complex containing a Ni(0)&#63743;Si bond is characterized by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopic methods and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Redox neutral catalytic cycles based on metal&#8208;ligand cooperation involving a Ni(0)&#63743;Si bond is disclosed.

Hydrosilylation of terminal alkenes catalyzed by a scandium metalloligand supported Ni(0) complex are studied. The anti&#8208;Markovnikov products are obtained in 62&#8211;89% yield, along with the alkanes and 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetraphenyldisilane as minor products. The resting&#8208;state complexes of hydrosilylation reactions are isolated and characterized by spectroscopic method and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, which represent rare&#8208;example of Ni(0) silyl complexes supported by scandium ions via a Ni(0)&#8594;Sc(III) interaction. The catalytic cycle is proposed to be redox neutral with Ni(0) center, and is facilitated by metal&#8208;ligand cooperation involving the Ni(0)&#63743;Si bond.

         <title>Chiral &#946;&#8208;Lactams by Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#63743;H Carbene Insertion</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 20, May 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#63743;H carbene insertion leads to the enantioselective formation of chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams in up to 82% isolated yield and excellent enantioselectivities up to 98% enantiomeric excess without any indication of a competing Buchner reaction. The reaction is catalyzed by a new ruthenium complex containing a chiral pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(oxazoline) ligand in combination with a cyclometalated phenylimidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine ligand.

A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular carbenoid insertion into a C(sp3)&#63743;H bond leads to the enantioselective formation of chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams. The reaction is catalyzed by a ruthenium complex featuring a chiral pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(oxazoline) ligand, combined with a cyclometalated phenylimidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine ligand. This complex belongs to a recently introduced new class of ruthenium catalysts (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2020, 59, 12393). Starting from N&#8208;benzyl &#945;&#8208;diazoacetamides, chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams are provided in up to 82% isolated yield with up to 98% enantiomeric excess, without any occurrence of a Buchner side reaction. Mechanistic experiments reveal that &#946;&#8208;lactam (4&#8208;membered ring) formation is inherently favored over the more common &#947;&#8208;lactam (5&#8208;membered ring) formation.

         <title>Zinc (II) Imidoyl Azide Coordination Polymer, an Unexpected Compound with Insensitive Explosive Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 20, May 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of coordination polymer has been discovered while looking for high&#8208;performance, insensitive secondary explosives. This polymer made of scarce imidoyl azide structures, demonstrates interesting pyrotechnic characteristics like a density greater than 2.00&#8197;g.cm&#8722;3 and great insensitivity towards thermal and mechanical stresses. The observation of such an intermediate shows the mechanism complexity of the Demko&#8208;Sharpless [3+2] cycloaddition and provides insight into the discovery of new energetic coordination polymers.







Abstract
A wide interest has recently been shown for the use of the tetrazole ring structures in the preparation of insensitive high&#8208;energy materials. Tetrazoles provide a perfect balance between insensitivity and explosive performances and several synthetic routes are available to generate such compounds in high yields. When studying the two&#8208;step synthesis of N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis((1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)methyl)nitramide (BTMNA), suggested by Shreeve et&#8197;al., an unexpected intermediate structure was observed. This stable intermediate in aqueous conditions, reacted with hydrochloric acid to generate the desired tetrazole heterocycle suggesting the existence of a scarce organozinc imidoyl azide compound, also coined &#8220;open tetrazole&#8221;. This unusually stable structure is exceptionally isolated as a solid. Furthermore, the possibility of zinc ions coordinating several organic imidoyl azide molecules at the same time, creates a sparse and unprecedented coordination polymer. This new polymeric intermediate is revealed in the synthesis of BTMNA when the starting material, the iminodiacetonitrile (IDA), reacts with sodium azide in water with the assistance of zinc chloride. The intermediate was characterized by Infrared spectroscopy (IR), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP&#8208;OES). The observation of such unprecedented intermediates shows the mechanism complexity of the Demko&#8208;Sharpless [3+2] cycloaddition and broadens the understanding of the formation and potential use of organic zinc imidoyl azide coordination polymers as insensitive explosives.

Rh(III)&#8208;Catalysis in Water: A recyclable Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed aqueous C&#8722;H annulation was developed, utilizing solubility differences to enable efficient tetrahydrocarbazole synthesis with simplified recovery and broad substrate compatibility.







Abstract
Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycles via regioselective C&#8722;H bond activation is both highly efficient and atom&#8208;economical but often hindered by the use of toxic solvents and limited catalyst recyclability. Herein, we present a recyclable Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H annulation of N&#8208;pyrimidinyl aryl amines with cyclic 1,3&#8208;diones in water, affording tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives. The basic aqueous environment amplifies the solubility differences between the substrates and the desired product, thereby promoting efficient C&#8722;H activation and subsequent cyclization. This method showcases broad substrate compatibility, eliminates the need for pre&#8208;synthesized iodonium ylides, and features an easy work&#8208;up procedure alongside straightforward catalyst recovery. The Rh(III) catalyst retains its activity for at least five cycles, providing a sustainable and practical strategy for N&#8208;heterocycle synthesis.

A green and efficient protocol is developed for the synthesis of pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines via para&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid&#8208;catalyzed tandem Michael addition and cyclization of 5&#8208;aminopyrazoles with terminal keto&#8208;alkynes in ethanol at room temperature. The method offers high yields, NMR&#8208;pure products without chromatography, and scalability, as demonstrated in the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of a bioactive tubulin polymerization inhibitor.

A simple and effective approach has been established for the synthesis of novel multi&#8208;substituted pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidine derivatives utilizing 5&#8208;amino&#8208;pyrazoles and terminal keto&#8208;alkynes as starting materials. This method achieves excellent yields under catalytic acidic conditions in environmentally benign solvents (water/ethanol) at ambient temperature. Moreover, this protocol affords NMR pure products through a simple filtration process. Additionally, the synthetic utility is validated through a gram&#8208;scale synthesis of the biologically active tubulin inhibitor, 6. Thereby emphasizing the pivotal role of chemistry in designing and producing potent anticancer molecules for therapeutic use.

         <title>Reactions of Halogermylenes with N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: Selective Formation of Low Valent Ge(II) Species</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 20, May 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of halogermylenes&#160;with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) to form halogermylene mono&#8208;NHC adducts and the germyliumylidene cation bis&#8208;NHC adducts is explored. Structural analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal their polarized covalent Ge&#63743;C bonds and dynamic NHC ligand exchange.

The reactions of the Rind&#8208;based 1,2&#8208;dihalodigermenes, (Eind)BrGe=GeBr(Eind) (1a), and (EMind)ClGe=GeCl(EMind) (1b), with two types of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) (Im&#8208;iPr2Me2 and Im&#8208;Me4) result in the formation of the halogermylene mono&#8208;NHC adducts, (Im&#8208;iPr2Me2)(Eind)GeBr (2a') and (Im&#8208;iPr2Me2)(EMind)GeCl (2b'), and the germyliumylidene cation bis&#8208;NHC adducts, [(Im&#8208;Me4)2(Eind)Ge]+[Br&#8722;] (3a) and [(Im&#8208;Me4)2(EMind)Ge]+[Cl&#8722;] (3b). The resulting Ge(II) species are stabilized by the bulky Rind groups and the strongly &#963;&#8208;donating NHC ligands, whose structures are confirmed by a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) analysis. Based on density functional theory (DFT) and quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM)&#160;calculations of 2a&#8217; and the cationic part of 3a, it is concluded that while the Ge&#63743;C(Eind) and Ge&#63743;C(NHC) bonds exhibit distinct differences in their degrees of polarization, all the Ge&#63743;C bonds display a partially polarized covalent character. Both reaction energy calculations and experimental studies suggested the potential liberation of an NHC ligand from the germyliumylidene cation bis&#8208;NHC adducts, leading to the exchange of the NHC ligands. The formation mechanism of 3a from 1a and two NHC molecules via (Im&#8208;Me4)(Eind)GeBr (2a) is discussed based on DFT calculations.

Chromium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling of Geminal Difluoroalkenes with Aliphatic Halides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 20, May 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of geminal difluoroalkenes with alkyl halides is catalyzed by low&#8208;cost CrCl2 combining with dtbpy ligand. It provides a viable strategy to stereoselectively form alkylated Z&#8208;fluoroalkenes, achieving the compatibility to a wide range of functionalities such as iodide, bromide, chloride, cyano, amino, and ester.

Herein, an effective, mild, and practical approach to stereoselective cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of difluoroalkenes with alkyl halides by cost&#8208;effective chromium catalysis is reported. This reaction is promoted by inexpensive CrCl2 combining with bipyridine ligand and manganese as the reductant, enabling the achievement of the reductive coupling of geminal difluoroalkenes with primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl halides at ambient temperature. It provides a valuable and scalable approach to form tri&#8208;substituted Z&#8208;fluoroalkylalkenes with good compatibility with a range of important functional groups. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the coupling reaction is initiated by forming alkyl radical by addition to alkene and combining with Cr(II) or by coordination with Cr(II) and carbometallation of difluoroalkenes in giving (alkyl)Cr species, which converts to Z&#8208;alkylated fluoroalkene motifs in a stereoselective manner by elimination of &#946;&#8208;fluoride atoms.

         <title>Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Bis(Phosphine) Monoxides and N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Phosphine Oxides through Michaelis&#8211;Arbuzov Reactions of Phosphinite Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 20, May 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Michaelis&#8211;Arbuzov reaction of dihaloalkanes with methyl dialkylphosphinite esters provides a modular approach to bis(phosphine) monoxide ligands with different substituents on the two phosphorus centers. The intermediate haloalkylphosphine oxide reacts with N&#8208;arylimidazoles to give phosphine oxide&#8208;substituted N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand precursors.

A modular synthesis of bis(phosphine) monoxide (BPMO) ligands has been realized using the Michaelis&#8211;Arbuzov reaction of dialkylphosphinite esters. The modular synthetic method allows the chemoselective synthesis of BPMO ligands in which the substituents on the two phosphorus centers are different. This methodology also provides a route to N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphine oxide ligand precursors.

The Cover Feature shows how cellulosic materials, derived from natural sources such as algae, were functionalized with fluorine. Fluoro&#8208;functionalized cellulosic materials were incorporated in alginate beads to remove organic pollutants from wastewater. Functionalization led to a three&#8208; to eightfold increase in the dye&#8208;removal efficiency; in addition the resulting functionalized&#8208;beads can be easily recycled for several cycles. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Rizzo and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/ejoc.202500035).

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Regio&#8208;selective Dual&#8208;Functionalization of Arenes: Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Functional Aromatics via Aromaticity Destruction&#8208;Reconstruction Process</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 20, May 28, 2025. </description>

Dual functionalization of arenes via a dearomatization&#8208;functionalization&#8208;rearomatization strategy facilitates chemo&#8208; and regioselective functionalization on phenols or anilines. This strategy proceeds via 2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienones and 2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienimines intermediates and permits a wide range of functionalizations with various coupling partners, enabling rapid molecular diversification under sustainable and transition metal&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Dual functionalizations of arenes promise to remain a powerful and versatile strategy for the synthesis of complex molecules with diverse applications in various fields. Dearomatization&#8208;Functionalization&#8208;rearomatization strategy emerges as a versatile tool for chemo&#8208; and regioselective functionalization of arenes via 2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienone/2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienimines, which can be easily accessible from phenols or anilines. 2,5&#8208;Cyclohexadienones serve as an &#8220;aromatic to be&#8221; synthon with multiple electrophilic centres, providing an opportunity towards their functionalization. While mono&#8208;functionalization was widely explored and covered in literature, simultaneous dual functionalizations with two distinct coupling partners offer a powerful strategy for rapid molecular diversification around aromatic rings. Diverse functional groups/coupling partners have been introduced chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selectively. The synthetic processes adopted are generally sustainable and free from transition metals and exotic conditions. This review showcased the advancement in developing dual functionalizations of phenols/anilines for the site&#8208;selective synthesis of multi&#8208;functional arenes through an aromaticity&#8208;destruction&#8208;functionalization&#8208;construction strategy.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Promoted Direct C&#63743;S and C&#63743;Se Bond Formation from Csp3&#63743;H Bonds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 20, May 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the significant advancements in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed direct chalcogenylation of Csp3&#63743;H bonds over the past decade (2014&#8211;2024). The discussion is organized by transition metal catalysts, with particular emphasis on mechanistic insights of these transformations. Additionally, the review highlights the direct incorporation of various sulfur&#8208; and selenium&#8208;containing functional groups via diverse catalytic systems.

The transition metal&#8208;catalyzed direct C&#63743;S and C&#63743;Se bond formation from C&#63743;H bonds has emerged as an efficient synthetic strategy for constructing previously inaccessible organochalcogen compounds, opening a new gateway to late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutical&#8208;relevant molecules and organic functional materials. C&#63743;Y bonds (Y&#63742;S, Se, Te) also show outstanding strategic relevance as handles to access other valuable functional groups downstream in a synthetic route. Despite the significant progress, the chemo&#8208;, site&#8208;, and enantioselective C&#63743;S and C&#63743;Se bond formation from unactivated Csp3&#63743;H bonds is still challenging owing to its low polarity and inertness. Here, a comprehensive overview of the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed direct conversion of unactivated Csp3&#63743;H to C&#63743;S and C&#63743;Se bonds in the last decade is provided, looking to motivate the continuous discovery of innovative and efficient systems for these transformations.

         <title>Nitrile N&#8208;Oxide&#8208;based Fluorescent Probe to Impart Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission to Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent probes have been used extensively in chemical biology, allowing the visual observation of bioactive compounds.&#160; While many variations of fluorescent probes that react to polar functional groups have been developed, there are few fluorescent probes that directly modify less polar compounds.&#160; In this paper, pyrene&#8208;containing nitrile N&#8208;oxide (Pyrene&#8208;NO) has been designed and synthesized as a fluorescent dye clickable to alkenes without a catalyst.&#160; Pyrene&#8208;NO shows good reactivity to a terminal alkene, a polymer methacrylate, and a natural unsaturated lipid with internal alkenes to give the corresponding cycloadducts with pyrene as the fluorescent dye.&#160;&#160; The cycloadducts show aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behaviors in a poor solvent. &#160;While the adducts to 1&#8208;hexene or polymer methacrylate show AIE in water, the adduct to castor oil as a natural glycerolipid shows AIE in MeOH.&#160; The AIE behaviors are evidenced by the dependence of fluorescence intensity on the concentration and the enhanced fluorescence at 77 K compared with that at room temperature.&#160; It is suggested that aggregation of the cycloadduct in the poor solvent would kinetically suppress the non&#8208;radiative deactivation of the excited state of pyrene based on interactions with oxygen, leading to an increase in fluorescence intensity.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of efficient ambipolar charge&#8208;carrier transporting deep&#8208;red to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores, namely MNTFT, PNTFT, and BMNTFT, based on an asymmetric donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor' (D&#8208;A&#8208;D') structure, as well as their application as non&#8208;doped emitters in NIR organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The molecules comprise naphtho[2,3&#8208;c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (Nz) as a strong A, bis(4&#8208;diphenylaminophenyl)fluorene as D, and either diphenylamine or dimethylaminophenyl as D'. Both experimental and theoretical investigations confirm that they exhibit hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) excited states, which enable the pathways for harvesting triplet hot exciton via high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing (hRISC) with intense NIR emissions (&#8764;708 nm). Their asymmetrical D&#8208;A&#8208;D' features benefit well&#8208;balanced hole and electron mobilities, resulting in a successful application as a non&#8208;doped emissive layer in the OLEDs with decent performance. Particularly, the MNTFT&#8208;based non&#8208;doped device shows an NIR emission with a peak at 710 nm, a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 2.51%, and a low turn&#8208;on voltage of 3.2 V. These results represent a significant advancement in the development of NIR fluorescent materials and OLED devices, meeting key requirements for various applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free HFIP&#8208;Promoted Synthesis of Benzhydryl Derivatives from Stilbenes as Masked Electrophiles under Oxidative Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzhydryl derivatives were synthesized by a new strategy involving the use of stilbenes as an electrophilic reaction partner through umpolung reactivity in a nucleophilic substitution reaction. The transformation, which requires oxidative treatment with mCPBA and the presence of 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) as an essential solvent and reaction promoter, occurs through multiple consecutive steps. Under these conditions, different benzhydryl derivatives were synthesized by coupling stilbenes with a variety of nitrogenated, oxygenated, and sulfur&#8208; and carbon&#8208;based nucleophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the [3+2] Cycloaddition Reaction of Azomethine Ylides with Methyl Vinyl Ketone in the Triplet Excited State: A Molecular Electron Density Theory Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photochemically induced [3+2] cycloaddition of azomethine ylide with methyl vinyl ketone begins with the formation of a triplet biradical intermediate INT1 via the transition state structure TST1. The formation of the final spirooxindole SOIS0 requires intersystem crossing at INT1. The reaction in the triplet state is only 589 times faster than in the ground state.

The [3+2] cycloaddition (32CA) reaction of an azomethine ylide with methyl vinyl ketone in the ground and first triplet excited states has been studied within the framework of molecular electron density theory. A density functional theory&#8208;based reactivity analysis indicates that, while azomethine ylide behaves as a supernucleophile in both states, vinyl ketone acts as a strong electrophile. This 32CA reaction presents a very low activation energy both in the ground state, 3.40&#8201;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, and in the triplet state, 1.47&#8201;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, in the gas phase. While in the ground state, the 32CA reaction is entirely ortho regio and fully endo stereoselective, in the triplet state it is entirely ortho regioselective but only partially endo stereoselective. In the ground state, the reaction proceeds to form the spirooxindole after passing through the transition state structure, whereas in the triplet state, the reaction stops at a biradical intermediate, which requires an intersystem crossing to yield the final spirooxindole. Analysis of the kinetic parameters of the 32CA reaction in the two states in methanol indicates that in the triplet state, the reaction is only 589 times faster than in the ground state.

Comparative Computational Study on the Robinson&#8211;Gabriel Synthesis and Bischler&#8211;Napieralski Reaction: Density Functional Theory Investigation of T3P&#8208;Mediated Ring Closure</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The detailed comparison of the Bischler&#8211;Napieralski and Robinson&#8211;Gabriel reactions of tryptamides using propylphosphonic anhydride (T3P) that leads to different products in case of a small change in the substrate is provided. The computed mechanistic pathways explain why the oxoalkyl tryptamide derivative selectively reacts in a Robinson&#8211;Gabriel cyclization and does not give any Bischler&#8211;Napieralski product.

Previously, this study reported novel and efficient methods for the Bischler&#8211;Napieralski and Robinson&#8211;Gabriel reactions of tryptamides under microwave conditions using propylphosphonic anhydride (T3P). Furthermore, it presents the first computational study on Bischler&#8211;Napieralski reaction of Nb&#8208;benzoyltryptamine with T3P leading to 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carboline. Here, it provides the detailed comparison of both T3P promoted reactions that actually lead to different products in case of a small change in the substrate. To reveal the effect of the substrate structure, density functional theory (DFT) computations have been performed on the two model tryptamides leading to three different product molecules. The computed mechanistic pathways correspond to the experimental observations and explain why the oxoalkyl tryptamide derivative selectively reacts in a Robinson&#8211;Gabriel cyclization (highest activation Gibbs free energy is 194.9&#8201;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and does not give any Bischler&#8211;Napieralski product (highest activation Gibbs free energy of the pathway is 269.4&#8201;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). It can also be understood why high temperature is required for both reactions. It is the first occasion in the literature that these two reactions are compared by DFT calculations.

Enantioselective Desymmetrization of Bisphenol Derivatives by Organocatalytic Sulfonylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient organocatalytic strategy involving the desymmetrization&#8211;sulfonylation of bisphenols is introduced for the synthesis of chiral 1,1&#8208;diarylalkanes. A chiral thiourea catalyst enables the selective sulfonylation of one hydroxyl group with a sulfonyl chloride in a CHCl3/H2O system under basic conditions, affording the reaction products with high yields and enantioselectivities.

Chiral 1,1&#8208;diarylalkanes are synthesized by enantioselective desymmetrization of bisphenol derivatives through an organocatalytic sulfonylation reaction. The methodology involves the selective sulfonylation of one enantiotopic hydroxyl group of a bisphenol using a sulfonyl chloride with a chiral thiourea catalyst in a CHCl3/H2O system under basic conditions. The resulting products are obtained in good to high yields (up to 97%) with high enantioselectivity (up to 90.5:9.5 er). Remarkably, compounds that are almost enantiomerically pure can be obtained from the mother liquor after crystallization.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Isomerization of Oxabicyclic Alkenes to 1,2&#8208;Naphthalene Oxides: A Density Functional Theory Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed isomerisation of unsymmetrical C1 and aryl&#8208;substituted 7&#8208;oxabenzonorbornadienes is studied using density functional theory (DFT). Elucidating the three&#8208;step catalytic cycle: oxidative addition, &#951;1&#8208; to &#951;3&#8208;allyl isomerisation, and reductive elimination determined the rate&#8208;determining step to be the oxidative addition. DFT calculations provide mechanistic insights into the steric and electronic effects behind the formed regioisomers.

The mechanism and regioselectivity of ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed isomerization of C1&#8208;substituted, unsymmetrical oxabenzonorbornadienes (OBDs) are investigated using density functional theory (DFT). This study elucidates a three&#8208;step catalytic cycle: oxidative addition, &#951;1&#8208; to &#951;3&#8208;allyl isomerization, and reductive elimination. Analysis of the free energy profile identifies oxidative addition as the rate&#8208;determining step and as the primary contributor to regioselectivity. DFT calculations predict that electron&#8208;deficient OBDs preferentially yield 1,2&#8208;naphthalene oxide, while electron&#8208;rich OBDs favor the formation of 1&#8208;naphthol products, in agreement with experimental findings.

         <title>Benzochalcogenodiazoles, Synthesis, and Applications in Medicinal Chemistry and Photomedicine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzochalcogenodiazoles (BXD) including benzoxadiazoles, benzothiadiazoles, and benzoselenadiazoles are initially mainly designed for optoelectronic materials as electron&#8208;deficient cores. Nevertheless, they are now extending their application to biology. In this review, the synthesis of BXDs and their use in medicinal chemistry as lipophilic aromatics and in photomedicinal chemistry as photosensitizers will be presented.

Benzochalcogenodiazoles (BXDs) (BOD: benzoxadiazole, BTD: benzothiadiazole, or BSD: benzoselenadiazole) are aromatic bicyclic compounds, containing chalcogen atoms, with applications ranging from material to medicinal chemistry. The recent developments in their preparation and functionalization are taking advantage of new methodologies such as C&#63743;H activation and photocatalysis. After being almost restricted to organic semiconductor materials for optoelectronics applications, they are gaining more and more interest in medicinal chemistry as lipophilic aromatic fragments. Their unique optical properties make them attractive in biological imaging and in photomedicine, with emission up to the near&#8208;infrared biological transparency window. The nature of the chalcogen atom influences their optical properties, with sulfur and selenium atoms favoring phototherapy over fluorescence. This review will not describe optoelectronic materials and fluorophores based on BXD but will focus on the preparation of BXD&#8208;containing compounds, and their medicinal and photomedicinal applications.

         <title>Tagitinin C, a Sesquiterpene Lactone, and Derivatives as Proteasome Inhibitors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tagitinin C, a sesquiterpene lactone from Tithonia diversifolia, shows a good level of activity on the proteasome system. Although the molecule is sensitive to light, pH changes, and nucleophiles, a derivatization program is devised to build intellectual property and obtain more stable analogs.

Tagitinin C, a germacranolide isolated from Tithonia diversifolia, is shown to be an inhibitor of the proteasome pathway. It is, however, a particularly unstable molecule, sensitive to acids, bases, nucleophiles, and light. Herein, a series of modifications aimed at improving the chemical and biological properties of the molecule is described. This study particularly focuses on isobutyrate chain replacement with other esters or ethers. The key steps are the cross&#8208;conjugated dienone reactivity neutralization by reduction and methylene lactone protection with morpholine or imidazole. Selective saponification of the isobutyrate is also achieved with crude pig liver esterase, leading to tagitinol C in moderate yield. Heliangine from the Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus) and hydroxylated derivatives of tagitinin C from the common sunflower (Helianthus annuus), two abundant field crops, constitute alternative sources of germacranolide derivatives not accessible from tagitinin C. Some esters are more potent than the lead compound, whereas the di&#8208;ethers display higher activity levels, probably due to better in&#8201;vivo stability.

A hypodiboric acid&#8211;sodium carbonate&#8208;mediated reductive cyclization of nitro(hetero)arenes has been developed for synthesizing imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines, benzoxazoles, benzothiazoles, benzoxazolones, and benzoxathiones. The reaction exhibits broad scope and functional group compatibility. Na2CO3 is essential for the reaction. Using this method, biologically active compounds like Zolimidine, Miroprofen, and Chlorzoxazone are successfully synthesized.

         <title>Streamlining Vorinostat Synthesis: A Chemoenzymatic Continuous Flow Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoenzymatic protocol for the synthesis of histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat has been established. Immobilized lipase from C. antarctica (imm&#8208;CaLB) allowed the functionalization of suberanoyl acid 1 and further conversion to vorinostat via ion&#8208;exchange resin treatment. The continuous flow system affords vorinostat in high yield, avoiding chromatographic purifications, shortening the reaction time and minimizing solvent usage and waste production.

Anticancer agent vorinostat is one of the only three commercialized histone deacetylase inhibitors approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of cutaneous T&#8208;cell lymphoma. Several synthetic pathways and only one biocatalytic approach have been designed over the years. However, no chemoenzymatic approaches have been described to date. Herein, the first two&#8208;step protocol for the obtainment of vorinostat is presented, which combines the chemical acylation of aniline followed by the lipase&#8208;catalyzed (immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica) condensation and the final hydrolysis with an acidic resin. Initially, batch studies allow to obtain vorinostat in high yield (70%) in 16&#8201;h using eco&#8208;friendly t&#8208;amyl alcohol as the reaction medium. Subsequently, the protocol is transferred to a continuous flow reactor, which reduces the overall time to 4&#8201;h while keeping the same final yield. Furthermore, the developed procedure minimizes solvent waste and enhances system automation, paving the way for a feasible application to further hydroxamic acid moieties of pharmaceutical interest.

         <title>Photoinduced Copper&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Arylation Reaction of N&#63743;H Heteroarenes Using Aryl Thianthrenium Salts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted copper&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;arylation protocol is described that enables direct C&#63743;N bond construction between N&#63743;H heteroarenes and arenes by the use of aryl thianthrenium salts. This photoactivation strategy demonstrates extensive substrate scope and offers a means to retain an activated functional group (such as Br, CHO, and CN) for subsequent derivatization reactions.

Herein, an efficient photoinduced copper&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;arylation reaction is presented, which occurs through the cross&#8208;coupling of N&#63743;H heteroarenes with aryl thianthrenium salts (Ar&#8208;TTs). This photoactivation strategy exhibits broad substrate scope and offers a method for preserving activated functional groups (such as Br, CHO, and CN) for subsequent derivatization reactions.

Fluorescent Bis&#8208;Dihydropyridine Hybrids: Design, Synthesis, and Redox Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, photophysical, and electrochemical properties of hybrid derivatives of nonsymmetrical bis&#8208;dihydropyridines are described. These compounds are obtained by multicomponent Hantzsch ester synthesis followed by a click reaction. Interestingly, photophysical and electrochemical properties of this class of compounds will allow them to be considered for potential applications in biological processes and their potential antioxidant activity.

A set of eight fluorescent symmetric and nonsymmetric bis&#8208;dihydropyridine hybrid molecules (DHP&#8211;DHP) are designed and synthesized through the sequential multicomponent Hantzsch ester synthesis followed by the azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition reaction methodology with the formation of a nonenolizable triazole linker between the two dihydropyridine portions. The luminescence properties are evaluated by absorption and fluorescence emission (steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved) techniques, aided by density functional theory calculations. The redox properties of this new series of DHP derivatives are also evaluated.

         <title>NNN Palladium(II)Pincer Complex in a Borrowing Hydrogen Process: Alkylation of Indoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NNN&#8211;Pd(II) pincer complex is utilized in the selective synthesis of C3&#8208;alkylated indoles as well as the synthesis of bis(indolyl)methanes by tuning the reaction conditions using the same substrates. The control experiments and quantum chemical analysis suggest that C3 functionalization of indole involves a &#8220;borrowing hydrogen process.&#8221;

Recently, an azine NNN&#8211;Pd(II) nonpalindromic pincer complex is generated, and its application in acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling is explored. This article establishes the application of the same pincer complex in the borrowing hydrogen process (BHP). Herein, the selective synthesis of C3 alkylated indoles (CAIs) is reported. Remarkably, this catalyst enables the synthesis of bis(indolyl)methanes (BIMs) by tuning the reaction conditions using the same substrates. The control experiments and quantum chemical analysis suggest that C3 functionalization of indole involves BHP. The formation of BIMs is an additional advantage.

         <title>Electrochemical Fluorination of Proline Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of a fluorine into aliphatic substituents of lead candidates can impart unique structural characteristics that allow fine tuning of drug interactions; therefore, mild, specific or late&#8208;stage fluorination procedures are of growing interest in medicinal chemistry, with the potential to be applied in F&#8208;18 radiochemistry. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of &#8220;reagent&#8208;less&#8221; electrochemical fluorination leading to mono&#8208; and gem&#8208;difluorinated proline cores featured in important fibroblast&#8208;activating protein inhibitors. Our study highlights the importance of using the appropriate activator substituents for allowing the process, the impact of different reaction parameters, and characterizes the various byproducts that are generated in the reaction. We have tested the reaction using a commercially available batch system and flow apparatus, achieving maximum yields of &gt;90% (batch) for mono&#8208; and of 6% (batch) and 9% (flow) for the gem&#8208;difluorinated proline model. These proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept results indicate that the flow approach is more efficient, but that different activating substituents will be needed to achieve higher yields</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Reaction of Diiodoperfluoroalkanes with Aromatic Compounds: Divergent Synthesis of Two Product Types</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of aromatic compounds with diiodoperfluoroalkanes are investigated, and it is found that different products can be synthesized depending on the reaction conditions and amounts of reagents. In particular, the reaction of 1,4&#8208;diiodoperfluorobutane under UV irradiation provides unique cyclic perfluoroalkyl aromatic compounds.

Both UV&#8208;light&#8208;promoted and organic&#8208;dye&#8208;catalyzed visible light&#8208;promoted reactions of diiodoperfluoroalkanes with an iodine substituent at both ends and substituted anilines are attempted. In the reactions with 1,6&#8208; and 1,8&#8208;diiodoperfluoroalkanes in the presence of an excess amount of aniline, both ends of the iodide reacts to give a diamine, and the reaction with an excess amount of diiodide gives a monoiodide, in which one end of the diiodide has reacted with the aniline. In contrast, in the case of the 1,4&#8208;diiodoperfluoroalkane, the UV reaction yields cyclization products in which both ends of the diiodine has reacted with the same aromatic ring, while the visible light reaction yields products in which only one end has reacted. Since synthetic examples of such cyclization products are limited, the reaction with various aromatic compounds is tried and it has been shown that it is effective for electron&#8208;rich aromatic rings. The mechanism of these reactions is discussed and the importance of the redox potential of the iodides is pointed out.

         <title>Synthesis of a Selena&#8208;Hybrid [5]Radialene Derivative and Exploration of Polycyclic Heteroterphenoquinones as Ambipolar Charge Carriers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>para&#8208;Terphenoquinone (pTPQ) in which a benzenoid ring has been replaced with a heterocycle is known as heteroterphenoquinone (HTPQ). While (H)TPQs are typically non&#8208;emissive and potentially open&#8208;shell species, we recently reported that fully fused polycyclic HTPQs (or PHTPQs) bearing a sulfur heteroatom could either exhibit fluorescence or antiaromaticity depending on the &#960;&#8208;conjugation arrangement in the core. Since the synthesis of PHTPQs is rare, until now limited to our own reported compound containing a sulfur atom, we have now synthesized a selenium&#8208;containing fluorescent PHTPQ while attempting the isolation of elusive dinaphthodicyclopenta[b,d]selenophene. The fluorescent PHTPQ was further dehydrogenated to synthesize the first PHTPQ with an embedded selenophenoradialene (selena&#8208;hybrid [5]radialene), which was found to exhibit antiaromatic properties. The narrow optical HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap, short intermolecular interactions in the solid state, and redox amphoterism prompted us to explore its ambipolar charge transport properties alongside the thia&#8208;analogue. The electron mobilities for PHTPQs comprising selenaradialene (1.96 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2&#8202;&#183;&#8202;V&#8722;1&#8202;&#183;&#8202;s&#8722;1) and thiaradialene (1.58 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2&#8202;&#183;&#8202;V&#8722;1&#8202;&#183;&#8202;s&#8722;1) cores were found to be one order of magnitude higher than that of the holes due to low&#8208;lying LUMO energy levels.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Multicomponent Reactions for the Synthesis of Diverse Heterocyclic Frameworks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review reports the state of the art of light&#8208;promoted reactions (blue, white, and green light), published in last five years (2021 up until the current date), in which either photocatalyst or no photocatalyst are required for the effective synthesis of divergent heterocyclic scaffolds under visible catalysis via multicomponent reactions.

The characteristics of visible light, including its sustainability, eco&#8208;friendliness, and potential for renewable energy, have made visible light&#8208;powered catalysis an intriguing research topic of great interest. In this case, photoredox catalysis uses a single&#8208;electron transfer mechanism under mild reaction conditions to produce very reactive radical species with frequently unusual reactivities. This work is the most comprehensive review of photochemical methods for producing divergent heterocycles through multicomponent reactions, covering important developments since 2021. This review is structured according to the kind of synthesized heterocyclic scaffold. Additionally, different study findings&#8217; scopes, limitations, and mechanistic studies are covered.

         <title>Recent Advances in Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Sulfinyl Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in catalytic preparation of chiral sulfinyl compounds via transition&#8208;metal&#8208;, organo&#8208;, and biocatalysis are summarized. This review comprises applications in catalytic asymmetric synthesis of various types of enantiopure sulfinyl derivatives (including sulfoxides, sulfinate esters, sulfinamides, and sulfoximines) and is arranged according to the catalytic types.

Chiral sulfinyl architectures have emerged as one of most important structural motifs in modern drug and agrochemical discovery due to their unique physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. They are also recognized as versatile platforms for novel chiral ligands, organocatalysts, and auxiliaries in asymmetric synthesis. Benefitting from the development of transition metal catalysis, organocatalysis, and biocatalysis technologies in recent years, attention has exploited to new tactics for the asymmetric construction of chiral sulfinyl compounds and their derivatives. This review highlights the advances in the field of catalytic preparation of enantiopure sulfinyl derivatives (including sulfoxides, sulfinate esters, sulfinamides, and sulfoximines) since 2020, with an emphasis on the substrate scope, mechanistic aspect, unmet challenges, and future opportunities.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Convertible Groups to Expand the Substrate Scope for Pentafluorosulfanylation of Styrenes by Photocatalytic Activation of Sulfur Hexafluoride</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalytic activation of sulfur hexafluoride, SF6, is an important synthetic method to access pentafluorosulfanylated organic compounds because of the non&#8208;toxic properties of this gas. However, the redox properties of the organic substrates must fit to the photoredox cycle for the activation of SF6. Strong electron&#8208;donating groups turned &#945;&#8208;phenyl styrenes into a redox&#8208;inactive state. These substrates had to be converted into redox&#8208;active derivatives by reversible modifications of the critical substituents. This concept of redox&#8208;convertible substituents has been successfully applied to expand the substrate scope for the pentafluorosulfanylation of &#945;&#8208;phenyl and &#945;&#8208;methyl styrenes by using SF6.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Carboxylation of Aryl Boronates in Supercritical CO2</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carboxylation using stable and abundant CO2 as a carbon source would be an attractive option in synthetic organic chemistry if the use of highly reactive organometals or toxic and expensive transition metals can be avoided. Herein we report a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free direct carboxylation of aryl trialkoxyboronates in supercritical CO2 (scCO2), promoted by a catalytic amount of ZnO. The use of cage&#8208;shaped trialkoxyboronates, which are both nucleophilic and soluble in scCO2, is the key to this reaction. DFT calculations indicate that the high pressure and high temperature of scCO2 with the ZnO catalyst compensate for the high activation energy of direct carboxylation of the boronates.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Rhamnose&#8208;Modified Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;Containing Saponins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of triterpenoid saponins bearing a Lewis&#8208;X trisaccharide analogue, in which the fucose residue is replaced by a rhamnose, is presented. These saponins, designed as negative controls in dendritic cell&#8208;specific intercellular adhesion molecule&#8208;3&#8208;grabbing nonintegrin&#8208;targeted therapeutic applications, are prepared through iterative and convergent glycosylation strategies, achieving good overall yields and complete control over stereoselectivity.

The synthesis of betulinic acid and echinocystic acid saponins featuring an unnatural analogue of the Lewis&#8208;X trisaccharide, in which the l&#8208;fucose residue is replaced by l&#8208;rhamnose, is reported. These triterpenoid saponins are designed as negative controls for dendritic cell&#8208;specific intercellular adhesion molecule&#8208;3&#8208;grabbing nonintegrin&#8208;targeted antiviral and immunological studies. The target saponins are synthesized using both iterative and convergent strategies, requiring nine and six steps, respectively, for the longest linear sequence starting from allyl betulinate and allyl echinocystate. Glycosylation reactions are performed using trihalogenoacetimidate and thioglycoside donors, which provide excellent yields and complete control over stereoselectivity. This work establishes a robust foundation for the synthesis of lupane&#8208; and oleanane&#8208;type triterpenoid saponins incorporating Lewis&#8208;X trisaccharide analogues.

         <title>Green&#8208;Light Cerium Photocatalysis Enabled by Pyridine N&#8208;Oxide Ligands</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridine N&#8208;oxides are found to be hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer ligands in cerium photocatalysis. Compared to previous described systems, the corresponding photoactive cerium(IV)&#8208;complex exhibits a distinct bathochromic shift, which enables the CH&#8208;hydrazination of small molecules with green light.

Pyridine N&#8208;oxides are reported as neutral ligands in cerium photocatalysis. By using those neutral ligands, photoactive Ce(IV)&#8208;species are generated, which show an extensive bathochromic shift compared to previously employed cerium&#8208;based complexes. This allows the effective utilization of green light in the redox&#8208;neutral CH&#8208;hydrazination of small molecules under very mild photocatalytic conditions.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Diastereoselective Radical Ring Opening of Bicyclobutanes to 1,1,3,3&#8208;Tetrasubstituted Cyclobutanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NHC&#8208;catalyzed radical ring opening of bicyclobutanes with readily accessible aldehydes and Togni I regents to afford 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetrasubstituted CF3&#8208;containing cyclobutanes is developed, which exhibits exclusive regioselectivity and up to excellent diastereoselectivity under mild conditions.

Herein, the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed ring opening of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) with aldehydes and Togni I reagents through a three&#8208;component radical relay process is reported, which affords 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetrasubstituted cyclobutanes. This reaction exhibits exclusive regioselectivity and up to excellent diastereoselectivity under mild and operating&#8208;simple conditions. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and several product derivatizations demonstrate their potential utilities as versatile building blocks in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Synthesis of Soluble Nickel&#8211;Salphen Ligand Complexes as Near&#8208;Infrared Dyes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five soluble nickel&#8208;salphen&#8208;type near&#8208;infrared dyes are synthesized by expanding the conjugation and introducing substituent groups. After the introduction of thiophene and electron&#8208;withdrawing terminal groups, these complexes exhibit a red shift in absorption, along with enhanced solubility in polar solvents and superior photothermal stability.

Salphen metal complexes have the advantages of simple synthesis, high stability, and excellent optical properties. However, their poor solubility, severe aggregation, and short absorption wavelengths limit their application as near&#8208;infrared dyes. In this study, five soluble Ni&#8211;salphen complexes with strong NIR absorption are synthesized by introducing alkyl chains and extending conjugated cores. The results show that the introduction of thiophene and electron&#8208;withdrawing end&#8208;groups has resulted in the red&#8208;shifted absorption of these complexes, with the absorption edge reaching 800&#8201;nm. These compounds have well solubility in organic solvents, more soluble than 8&#8201;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1 in chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, etc. The target molecules also have excellent photostability and thermal stability (Td&#8201;&gt;&#8201;325 &#176;C).

Base mediated 1,2&#8208;addition/oxa&#8208;Michael reaction sequence for the synthesis of sulfonylated isochromene is developed. The role of solvent is found to be crucial for the transformation. The method is extrapolated for the naphthalene and isocoumarine synthesis.

A base&#8208;promoted annulation via 1,2&#8208;addition/alkyne&#8208;allene isomerization/oxa&#8208;Michael cyclization of sulfonyl enynals for the synthesis of sulfonylated isochromene is developed. The choice of solvent plays a crucial role in this transformation to give the sulfonylated iscohromenes. The reaction mechanism is supported by the react&#8208;IR experiment. To emphasize the practical utility, the sulfonylated isochromene is deftly elaborated into diversely substituted naphthalene and isocoumarine.

         <title>Divergent Total Syntheses of 7,20&#8208;Epoxy, 3,20&#8208;Epoxy, and 6,7&#8208;seco&#8208;ent&#8208;Kaurane Diterpenoids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise and versatile synthesis of 7,20&#8208;epoxy&#8208;ent&#8208;kaurane diterpenoids is developed and its tetracyclic core is converted divergently to the skeletons of 3,20&#8208;epoxy and 6,7&#8208;seco&#8208;ent&#8208;kaurane diterpenoids via a bioinspired strategy. Collectively nine total syntheses are achieved.

The genus Isodon is a well&#8208;known traditional medicinal herb that serves as a rich source of cytotoxic ent&#8208;kaurane diterpenoids, which bear the same tetracyclic core of ent&#8208;kaurane with different oxygenation, bond&#8208;cleavage, and rearrangement patterns. The 7,20&#8208;epoxy&#8208;ent&#8208;kaurane diterpenoids are the most studied subclasses, which show promising anticancer activities. Moreover, they also have the potential for transforming to other subclasses of ent&#8208;kaurane diterpenoids. Herein, the details of this study on developing a highly diastereoselective synthetic strategy for the 7,20&#8208;epoxy&#8208;ent&#8208;kaurane diterpenoid (5 natural products) and its conversion to the 3,20&#8208;epoxy (2 natural products) and 6,7&#8208;seco derivatives (2 natural products) are reported. The synthetic strategy features a thermal Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition for the construction of the AB ring system, an intramolecular Mukaiyama Michael/carbocyclization cascade reaction for establishing the CD ring system, a site&#8208;stereoselective oxidation/reduction strategy for completion of the total syntheses of several representative 7,20&#8208;epoxy&#8208;ent&#8208;kaurane diterpenoids, and the divergent syntheses of Isodon diterpenoids in the 3,20&#8208;epoxy and 6,7&#8208;seco subclasses via bioinspired strategies.

         <title>Recent Advances in Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Multideuteration of (Hetero)Arenes via Hydrogen Isotope Exchange</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deuteration has gained a prominent role as a powerful method for investigating kinetic isotope effects in chemical reactions. Recent studies show that deuteration can significantly alter the pharmacokinetic and toxicological profiles of drug molecules, thereby enhancing their therapeutic efficacy. As a result, deuteration is being increasingly integrated into pharmaceutical development. At the same time, introducing deuterium into organic electronic materials helps to reduce high&#8208;frequency molecular vibrations, thus broadening the range of applications of organic materials, traditionally dominated by inorganic components.
Since the approval of the deuterated drug deutetrabenazine in 2017 and the commercialization of deuterated emissive materials for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, multideuteration technologies have advanced considerably. Various strategies utilizing both rare and earth&#8208;abundant metals to achieve efficient multideuteration have been reported. This review examines recently developed metal catalysts for multiple deuteration, discusses current challenges in deuteration methods, and explores future opportunities in this rapidly evolving field.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#63743;H Functionalization and Cyclization Reactions Using Hypervalent Iodine Reagents: A Review on Synthetic Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hypervalent iodine reagents (HIRs) are organoiodine compounds with iodine in +3 or +5 oxidation states. They mimic transition metals in oxidative reactions but are greener, easier to handle, and highly selective. HIRs are versatile tools widely used in oxidation, functional group transfer, cyclisation, and bond formation, offering sustainable and efficient options in synthetic organic chemistry.

Using hypervalent iodine reagents as a mediator or catalyst in C&#63743;H functionalization and cyclization reactions has emerged as a powerful strategy in organic synthesis. This review exhaustively probes the recent advancements in this field, focusing on copious reactions enabled by hypervalent iodine (III/V) reagents. The versatility of iodine as a promoter in numerous transformations, including C&#63743;H activation, functionalization, and cyclization processes is highlighted. The general mechanistic pathway of iodine in mediating these transformations, along with the underlying principles governing the selectivity and reactivity of these transformation processes, is discussed. Furthermore, reactions leading to the synthetic utility and applicability of iodine&#8208;catalyzed/promoted C&#63743;H functionalization and cyclization reactions in synthesizing complex natural products and biologically active molecules are showcased. Overall, this review provides valuable insight for researchers and pharmacists interested in harnessing the potential of hypervalent iodine in developing sustainable and efficacious synthetic methodologies.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Selective Desulfurization of Thioamides in Water and an Open System</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel protocol of selective desulfurization of thioamides to amines with dimethylaminoborane (DMAB) without catalysts, operating in neat water under an open system, is studied.

The selective reduction of the unsaturated substrates in green solvent is highly desired yet however, remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Especially the selective desulfurization of thioamides usually requires hazardous highly reactive reagents or transition metal catalysts in high&#8208;pressure conditions. Herein, a novel protocol of selective desulfurization of thioamides to amines with dimethylaminoborane (DMAB) without catalysts, operating in neat water under an open system, is presented. Notably, the selectivity of the reaction is effectively controlled with a simple Lewis acid additive through computational design. The combination of density functional theory and experimental mechanism studies reveals the important synergistic cooperation by DMAB and Lewis acid additive to facilitate the hydrogenative desulfurization process in an aqueous solution.

         <title>Synthesis of a Library of Bifunctional N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligand Precursors with Hydrogen Bond Donor Subunits</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward two&#8208;step synthesis to bifunctional precursors of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) is developed. Based on this, a library of imidazolium&#8208;based NHCs, with a variety of hydrogen bond donor groups in the backbone is prepared. The utility of the bifunctional NHC ligands is demonstrated in transition metal catalysis with the resulting palladium(II) and copper(I) complexes.

Bifunctional N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) with additional hydrogen bond donor groups in the backbone are important organocatalysts and ligands for transition metal complexes. Herein, a straightforward synthetic approach to a library of bifunctional imidazolium salts, precursors for the respective NHCs with amidine, squaramide, and (thio)urea moieties as hydrogen bond donors, is reported. The preparation of bifunctional palladium(II) and copper(I) NHC complexes and their application in catalysis is presented.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Induced Trifluoromethylation of (Hetero)Arenes by Using SF6 as an Oxidant</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light&#8208;driven trifluoromethylation protocol using SF6 as an oxidant has been developed. This method achieves regioselective C(sp2)&#8211;CF3 bond formation under mild conditions with Rose Bengal catalyst, blue LEDs and bench&#8208;stable CF3SO2Na. The reaction affords moderate to excellent yields across various (hetero)arenes, which facilitates the efficient utilization and degradation of the potent greenhouse gas SF6.

As a potent greenhouse gas, SF6 remains an underexplored oxidant despite its strong electronegativity. In this work, a visible light&#8208;driven trifluoromethylation protocol using SF6 as an oxidant has been developed. This method achieves regioselective C(sp2)&#8211;CF3 bond formation under mild conditions with Rose Bengal catalyst, blue LEDs and bench&#8208;stable CF3SO2Na, facilitating efficient utilization and degradation of the greenhouse gas SF6.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Directed C&#8211;H Heteroarylation of 2&#8208;Pyridones Using Cyclic Iodonium Ylides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;Pyridone is a crucial building block in bioactive natural products and serves as a vital intermediate for the synthesis of bioactive nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. Recent advancements in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization have enabled the direct modification of 2&#8208;pyridones, circumventing the need for pre&#8208;functionalization. In this study, we report a Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed, C6&#8208;selective C&#8211;H heteroarylation of 2&#8208;pyridones using cyclic iodonium ylides as carbene precursors. The versatility and broad applicability of this method are demonstrated through the efficient synthesis of diverse compounds featuring both 2&#8208;pyridone&#8208;pyridine and cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Determination and Characterization of Electronic Properties of Photosilylated Derivatives of C70</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis reveal the structures of two photoadducts of C70 with 1a as [d,d&#8217;]&#8208;1,4&#8208;adduct 2a and as [a,b]&#8208;1,2&#8208;adduct 3a. The latter structure represents the first example of crystallographic study of 1,3&#8208;disilolane (1,3&#8208;disilacyclopentane) derivatives of fullerenes. The electronic property of 3a was characterized based on electrochemical measurements and theoretical calculations.

The photoreactions of C70 and mesityl&#8208;substituted disilirane (disilacyclopropane) 1a afforded the corresponding adducts 2a and 3a, the former of which was reported previously. The structures of 2a and 3a are unequivocally established respectively as a 1,4&#8208;adduct at the [d,d'] site and as a 1,2&#8208;adduct at the [a,b] bond, respectively, using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses. The latter structure represents the first example of crystallographic study of 1,3&#8208;disilolane (1,3&#8208;disilacyclopentane) derivatives of fullerenes. The electronic properties of these products are characterized based on electrochemical and theoretical studies elucidating the electron&#8208;donating effects of silyl groups.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Tetrahydropyridines via Borrowing Hydrogen Strategy</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a manganese&#8208;catalyzed borrowing hydrogen cyclization of secondary alcohols with &#947;&#8208;amino alcohols in a practical synthesis of 2,3,4,5&#8208;tetrahydropyridines is reported.

         <title>New Glycoconjugates Containing Selenium and Polyphenols. Stereoselective Synthesis by Pummerer&#8208;like Rearrangement.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two series of novel six&#8208;membered Se&#8208;glycoconjugates containing hydroxycinnamic acids marked by well&#8208;known antioxidant properties are synthesized, exploiting a Mitsunobu reaction and a Pummerer&#8208;like rearrangement. A first example of six&#8208;membered selenosugar with selenium in the ring and bearing an acetal&#8208;like functional group at C&#8208;1 was reported, which is a useful precursor of hydrolytically stable oligosaccharide and nucleoside mimics.

In the last 20&#8201;years the exploitation of antioxidant activity of selenobased compounds has improved, just due to the use of Ebselen, a selenocompound, as a Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) mimic. However, their clinical use seems to be compromised by the low solubility in water. To deal with this problem, it is possible to take advantage of the new approach including selenosugars in which selenium replaces heterocyclic oxygen. In this frame, to optimize the antioxidant properties of selenosugars, the glycoconjugation with a polyphenolic unit, which is a molecule capable of inhibiting or disabling the action of free radicals, has been considered in this work. The Mitsunobu reaction mechanism links covalently the primary alcoholic function of selenobased glycosyl donors, coming from the commercially available d&#8208;mannose, and phenolic moiety acceptors, to obtain the corresponding glycoconjugates, has been exploited affording the products in efficient yields. A density functional theory (DFT) theoretical study is carried out to help understand the possible influence of the seleno donor on the reactivity. Crucially, a new pathway based on Pummerer&#8208;like rearrangement followed by a glycosylation, gave a selenosugar with selenium in the ring and bearing an acetal&#8208;like functional group at C&#8208;1. All compounds are characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy confirming their structures and purity.

Attempting to address the growing synthetic complexity (SC) of conjugated polymers, the interdependent syntheses of the common acceptors 4,7&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (Br2BTD), 5,8&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihexylquinoxaline (Br2Qx), and 4,7&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2H&#8208;benzotriazole (Br2BTA) are all revisited. The SC Index is determined for both the traditional and optimized syntheses, showing improvements in the generation of all three acceptors.

In an attempt to address the growing problem of synthetic complexity in conjugated organic polymers, the synthesis of the common acceptor units 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (BTD), quinoxaline (Qx), and 2H&#8208;benzotriazole (BTA) have been revisited, along with their dibromo derivatives necessary for use in catalytic cross&#8208;coupling. In addition to reducing the total number of synthetic steps, efforts have been made to reduce hazardous reagents and simplify purification. Synthetic complexity index values for both established and newly reported methods are then generated in order to provide a qualitative evaluation of the reduced contribution of these common building blocks to the synthetic complexity of all materials that contain them.

Silver&#8208;Mediated Cascade Synthesis of Open&#8208;Cage Fullerenes from C60 and Propargylic Carbonates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bisfulleroids featuring an eight&#8208;membered ring orifice are synthesized in a one&#8208;pot approach via a multistep reaction sequence involving heating a solution of fullerene C60 and propargylic carbonates in the presence of a silver catalyst. The implementation of this strategy for the introduction of various substituents is thoroughly investigated.

In recent years, open&#8208;cage fullerenes (i.e., fullerene derivatives featuring an orifice within their cage structure) have attracted significant attention across multiple research areas in materials, coordination, supramolecular, and biomolecular chemistry. However, the methodology available for the preparation of open&#8208;cage fullerenes remains limited. Herein, it is discovered that upon heating fullerene C60 with propargylic carbonates in the presence of silver trifluoroacetate, a cascade of reaction steps is initiated, resulting in the one&#8208;step synthesis of the corresponding open&#8208;cage bisfulleroids. Moreover, the feasibility of introducing various substituents via this methodology is confirmed. Notably, the proposed protocol facilitates the synthesis of bisfulleroid derivatives, wherein a hydrogen atom resides on one side of the bridgehead carbon at the orifice, while an aryl or alkyl substituent is strategically introduced on the opposite side. This approach provides structural diversity for the synthesis of open&#8208;cage fullerenes and is expected to promote the widespread application of open&#8208;cage fullerene derivatives.

         <title>Escape from Flatland: Pericyclic Reactions and Rearrangements of Diazofluorene with Biarylcyclooctynes for the Generation of Helicene&#8208;Like Phenanthro&#8208;Pyrazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the voyage of two flat, highly unsaturated systems into the third dimension. Specifically, we investigated the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of 9&#8208;diazofluorene with a rapidly growing class of strained dipolarophile&#8212;biarylcyclooctynes. We found that the initial spirocyclic 3H&#8208;pyrazole cycloadducts are isolable, and can be subjected to controllable [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic shifts. These van Alphen&#8211;H&#252;ttel rearrangements generate either the metastable 4H&#8208;pyrazoles&#8212;another spirocyclic fused&#8208;ring system with a highly contorted structure&#8212;or the thermodynamically favored 1H&#8208;pyrazoles. The 1H&#8208;pyrazoles display extended conjugation and can be classified as [5]&#8208;helicenes containing a phenanthro&#8208;pyrazole fused to a dihydro&#8208;cyclooctatetraene. Overall, these studies provide a modular framework to control heteroatom placement, ring size, and ring fusion in the syntheses of carbon&#8208;rich materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of N,N'&#8208;Bisindoles via Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Formal (4 + 1) Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for the efficient synthesis of N,N'&#8208;bisindoles has been established by gold&#8208;catalyzed formal (4&#8201;+&#8201;1) cycloaddition.This reaction occurred via a domino aza&#8211;Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement/aza&#8211;Michael addition sequence, which allows for the formation of two C&#63743;N bonds and the direct construction of an indole ring.

Indole&#8208;based heterocycles are commonly found in natural products and pharmaceuticals, so the synthesis of such heterocycles has become an important research area. In spite of the rapid development of this research area, the synthesis of N,N'&#8208;bisindoles remains challenging and is far less developed. Herein, we present the synthesis of N,N'&#8208;bisindoles via gold&#8208;catalyzed formal (4&#8201;+&#8201;1) cycloaddition of alkynylcyclohexadienones with N&#8208;aminoindoles, which involves a domino aza&#8211;Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement/aza&#8211;Michael addition sequence. This reaction allows for the formation of two C&#63743;N bonds and the direct construction of an indole ring, leading to the synthesis of a range of N,N'&#8208;bisindoles in moderate to high yields with broad functional group tolerance. This work not only provides a new and efficient strategy toward the synthesis of N,N'&#8208;bisindoles but also enriches the research contents of formal (4&#8201;+&#8201;1) cycloadditions and domino reactions.

&lt;p&gt;A new strategy for the efficient synthesis of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;'-bisindoles has been established by gold-catalyzed formal (4&#8201;+&#8201;1) cycloaddition.This reaction occurred via a domino aza&#8211;Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement/aza&#8211;Michael addition sequence, which allows for the formation of two C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N bonds and the direct construction of an indole ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indole-based heterocycles are commonly found in natural products and pharmaceuticals, so the synthesis of such heterocycles has become an important research area. In spite of the rapid development of this research area, the synthesis of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;'-bisindoles remains challenging and is far less developed. Herein, we present the synthesis of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;'-bisindoles via gold-catalyzed formal (4&#8201;+&#8201;1) cycloaddition of alkynylcyclohexadienones with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-aminoindoles, which involves a domino &lt;i&gt;aza&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement/&lt;i&gt;aza&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;Michael addition sequence. This reaction allows for the formation of two C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N bonds and the direct construction of an indole ring, leading to the synthesis of a range of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;'-bisindoles in moderate to high yields with broad functional group tolerance. This work not only provides a new and efficient strategy toward the synthesis of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;'-bisindoles but also enriches the research contents of formal (4&#8201;+&#8201;1) cycloadditions and domino reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tandem Synthesis of Pyrrolidine and Piperidine Derivatives from Propargylic Alcohols Under Multimetallic Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 2&#8208;carbonylmethyl substituted pyrrolidines and piperidines can be accessed from readily available propargylic alcohols and N&#8208;protected amino olefins through a tandem Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement/olefin cross&#8208;metathesis/intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition under Au and Ru catalysis. The stereochemical outcome of the Au&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition is kinetically controlled and depended on the nitrogen protecting group.

Herein reported is tandem synthesis of 2&#8208;carbonylmethyl pyrrolidine/piperidine derivatives from propargylic alcohols under multimetallic catalysis. A Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement of propargylic alcohols under cationic Au catalysis, followed by in&#8201;situ olefin cross&#8208;metathesis with appropriately protected amino olefins delivered &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, which without isolation underwent an intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition to afford a variety of pyrrolidine and piperidine derivatives. The scope of the present tandem reaction is investigated to show that common amine protecting groups, such as Ts, Ns, Cbz, and Bz, are well tolerated. Addition of a catalytic amount of bismuth(III) triflate is required for promoting the intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition where the N&#8208;protected amino group is less nucleophilic. The stereochemical consequence of the present tandem reaction is found to be dependent on the amine protecting group.

         <title>Enantioselective Anion&#8208;Binding&#8208;Catalyzed Nucleophilic Addition to 4&#8208;Quinolones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first organocatalytic enantioselective formal 1,4&#8208;addition to 4&#8208;quinolones has been developed. This method relies on chiral triazole&#8208;based anion&#8208;binding catalysis using enol nucleophiles, complementing previous metal catalytic approaches. Moderate to good yields and enantioselectivities were achieved by in&#8201;situ silylation and formation of a key quinolinium&#8208;catalyst chiral contact ion pair, allowing for chirality transfer to the product upon nucleophilic attack.

Chiral quinolones and their derivatives are predominant synthetic building blocks and pharmacological agents. Nevertheless, their synthesis mostly relies on transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective 1,4&#8208;additions of organometallic reagents such as Grignard, organozinc, or organoboron species for alkylation, arylation, and alkynylation reactions. Herein, the first organocatalytic enantioselective formal 1,4&#8208;addition to challenging 4&#8208;quinolones is reported, upon in&#8201;situ silylation to the corresponding quinolinium ions, followed by asymmetric nucleophilic attack to this type of substrates. This method complements previous metal&#8208;catalyzed approaches by enrolling enol nucleophiles and relies on anion&#8208;binding catalysis using a chiral triazole&#8208;based anion binder. The enantioenriched 2&#8208;substituted 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4&#8208;quinolones were thus obtained in good yields (up to 97% yield) and enantioselectivities up to 89:11 e.r. Finally, the easy access to 4&#8208;amino and &#947;&#8211;amino alcohol derivatives by post&#8208;functionalization, as well as to enantiopure compounds (&gt;99:1 e.r.), was showcased. The notable features of this protocol include its mild reaction conditions, avoiding the use of transition metals, broad functional group tolerance, and potential application toward the synthesis of chiral 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4&#8208;quinolones and tetrahydroquinolines as important skeletons of bioactive and natural products.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Ligand Cooperation for Iron(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Wittig&#8208;Type Olefination from Alcohols in Air</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot in situ alcohol oxidation&#8211;Wittig reaction in air using aphosphine&#8208;free Fe(II) catalyst (1) bearing a redox&#8208;active tridentate arylazo pincer was used to synthesize a broad range of substituted E olefins by dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols and phosphonium ylides. Mechanistic investigations revealed active participation of the arylazo scaffold as an electron and hydrogen reservoir in the catalytic cycle.

An iron&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot tandem in&#8201;situ oxidation&#8211;Wittig reaction is reported for the synthesis of alkenes. Using a bench&#8208;stable Fe(II) catalyst with a redox&#8208;noninnocent 2&#8208;((4&#8208;chlorophenyl)diazenyl)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligand scaffold, a broad spectrum of substituted E olefins is synthesized in good yields by the reaction of alcohols with phosphorus ylides. Control reactions and spectroscopic studies indicate synergistic participation of the ligand, which acts as a reservoir of electrons and hydrogen, during the dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols with the phosphorus ylides.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Allylation and Tandem Allylation&#8211;Cycloisomerization of Stannylated Propargyl Acetates with Allylsilanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and general method for the gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed allylation and tandem allylation&#8211;cycloisomerization of stannylated propargyl acetates with allylsilanes for the synthesis of 1,5&#8208;enynes, with a terminal alkyne, and bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes was developed. Stannylated propargyl acetates proved useful for improving the selective formation of 1,5&#8208;enynes and bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes. The tributylstannyl group is a transient protecting group that prevents side reactions.

Bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes, synthesized by the cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;enynes, serve as key scaffolds in various natural products. Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;enynes is an efficient route to bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes. However, gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed 1,5&#8208;enyne synthesis, particularly with a terminal alkyne, has not yet been fully explored. This study presents a mild and general method for the gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed allylation and tandem allylation&#8211;cycloisomerization of stannylated propargyl acetates with allylsilanes, yielding 1,5&#8208;enynes with terminal alkyne moiety and bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes. The catalytic system ((4&#8208;MeOC6H4)3PAuCl/AgSbF6) enabled the efficient synthesis of 1,5&#8208;enynes with good to high yields and regioselectivities. In addition, gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed tandem allylation&#8211;cycloisomerization using (JohnPhos)Au(MeCN)SbF6 afforded bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes with high regiocontrol. Stannylated propargyl acetates proved crucial in enhancing selectivity for both product classes.

&lt;p&gt;A mild and general method for the gold(I)-catalyzed allylation and tandem allylation&#8211;cycloisomerization of stannylated propargyl acetates with allylsilanes for the synthesis of 1,5-enynes, with a terminal alkyne, and bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-2-enes was developed. Stannylated propargyl acetates proved useful for improving the selective formation of 1,5-enynes and bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-2-enes. The tributylstannyl group is a transient protecting group that prevents side reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-2-enes, synthesized by the cycloisomerization of 1,5-enynes, serve as key scaffolds in various natural products. Gold(I)-catalyzed cycloisomerization of 1,5-enynes is an efficient route to bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-2-enes. However, gold(I)-catalyzed 1,5-enyne synthesis, particularly with a terminal alkyne, has not yet been fully explored. This study presents a mild and general method for the gold(I)-catalyzed allylation and tandem allylation&#8211;cycloisomerization of stannylated propargyl acetates with allylsilanes, yielding 1,5-enynes with terminal alkyne moiety and bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-2-enes. The catalytic system ((4-MeOC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PAuCl/AgSbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) enabled the efficient synthesis of 1,5-enynes with good to high yields and regioselectivities. In addition, gold(I)-catalyzed tandem allylation&#8211;cycloisomerization using (JohnPhos)Au(MeCN)SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; afforded bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-2-enes with high regiocontrol. Stannylated propargyl acetates proved crucial in enhancing selectivity for both product classes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improved Chemical Synthesis of Avenanthramides Family and its Analogs by Mixed Anhydride Method</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Valuable phytochemicals, including avenanthramides A, B, C, E, and some analogs, have been rapidly prepared as carbonate&#8208;protected derivatives in acetone, achieving high yields by crystallization.. This process utilizes the mixed anhydride method with a triethylamine&#8208;isobutyl chloroformate reagent system. The protection can be readily removed on demand by treating it with morpholine in methanol for one hour, yielding almost quantitative amounts of free avenanthramides.

Amides derived from common hydroxycinnamic acids&#8212;including 4&#8208;hydroxycinnamic acid, 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxycinnamic acid, 3,4&#8208;dihydroxycinnamic acid, 3,4&#8208;dimethoxycinnamic acid, and 3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxycinnamic acid&#8212;along with various free aminobenzoic acids, such as 5&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;aminobenzoic acid, a key component of the avenanthramide family, have been rapidly synthesized using an innovative, environmentally friendly synthetic methodology. This approach, grounded in traditional chemistry, utilizes mixed anhydrides to simultaneously protect and activate hydroxycinnamic acids through the actions of triethylamine and isobutyl chloroformate while employing acetone as a green solvent. The resulting amides, formed from the coupling with free aromatic amino acids, are constructed as O&#8208;carbonate&#8208;protected derivatives with high yields and purity, isolated directly via crystallization, thus eliminating chromatographic or HPLC purifications. Furthermore, free phenols can be conveniently released on demand using morpholine in methanol. Under these conditions, C&#8208;protected aromatic amino acids remain unacylated. This synthetic strategy represents a significant advancement over conventional acyl chloride methodologies, which often rely on toxic reagents and solvents and entail time&#8208;consuming and complex procedures. It enhances the production of important phytochemicals such as avenanthramides and opens doors to various analogs, paving the way for potential pharmacological applications.

         <title>Electroreductive Intramolecular Heck&#8208;Type Cyclization for the Synthesis of Benzofused Oxygenated Heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electroreductive strategy for synthesizing diverse benzofused oxygenated heterocycles via 5&#8208; or 6&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization. This method eliminates the need for transition&#8208;metal catalysts while suppressing competing hydrogenation and halogenation pathways at the exocyclic carbon radical center. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, exhibits excellent substrate tolerance, and improves atom economy.

Conventional synthetic routes to benzofused oxygenated heterocycles, such as dihydrobenzofuran, chromane, and isochromane derivatives, often involve complex synthetic conditions, high costs, and environmental concerns. The key to addressing this challenge lies in achieving transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C(sp2)&#63743;I bond cleavage to enable intramolecular radical cyclization. Inspired by electroreductive strategies, a convenient, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free electroreductive tandem reaction is developed for synthesizing dihydrobenzofuran, chromane, and isochromane derivatives. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that this approach not only simplifies synthetic conditions but also suppresses competing hydrogenation and halogenation pathways at the exocyclic carbon radical center.

         <title>Assembly of Molecular Complexity by Carbene Organocatalytic Multi&#8208;component Reactions involving &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Aldehydes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pursuit of molecular complexity is central to modern organic synthesis, as complex molecules are essential across various fields. The development of catalytic multi&#8208;component transformation strategies provides an efficient approach for the rapid and selective construction of complex molecular frameworks. Over the past decades, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis has emerged as a powerful tool in multi&#8208;component reactions (MCRs), enabling precise control over selectivity, stereochemistry, and functional group compatibility that significantly facilitate the assembly of complex molecular structures. This review provides an overview of recent advancements in carbene&#8208;catalyzed MCRs involving &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, with an emphasis on reactions incorporating three or more reactants. These transformations are categorized into electron&#8208;pairing and radical pathways, with a detailed discussion of their mechanisms, scope and limitations. Ultimately, this review aims to advance the development of catalytic strategies that leverage carbene organocatalysis to enable the efficient synthesis of value&#8208;added molecules from simple precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox Catalytic Two&#8208;Component Radical &#946;&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;Fluorosulfonamidation Reaction of Styrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed fluoro/fluorosulfonamidation reaction of styrenes by using 1&#8208;fluorosulfamoyl&#8208;pyridinium salt as a bifunctional reagent is described, which allows for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;fluoro sulfamoyl fluorides under mild conditions.

In this study, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated two&#8208;component &#946;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;fluorosulfonamidation reaction of styrenes is demonstrated. The bench&#8208;stable reagent, N&#8208;fluorosulfamoyl&#8208;pyridinium tetrafluoroborate can be used as a photoredox&#8208;active nitrogen&#8208;centered radical precursor and also as the fluoride source. This transformation can convert a series of styrenes to functional group&#8208;enriched products, including substrates with electron&#8208;donating or withdrawing groups, as well as di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituents on the C&#63743;C double bond.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The complex [CoII(4'&#8209;MeO&#8209;tpy)2](PF6)2 (4'&#8209;MeO&#8209;tpy = 4'&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2,2':6',2''&#8208;terpyridine) effectively mediates visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven arylation of pyrroles, 1,3,5&#8209;trimethoxybenzene and bis(pinacolato)diborane (B2Pin2).

         <title>SnCl2&#8208;Catalyzed Phosphorylation of Alcohols and Selective Phosphorylation/Phosphinoylation of Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, stannous chloride catalyzed phosphorylation of alcohols and selective phosphorylation of carbohydrates are explored, giving a new approach to obtain biologically active phosphorylated molecules.

Phosphorylated molecules, particularly phosphorylated carbohydrates, have garnered significant interest due to their distinct biological activities, driving an urgent demand for efficient phosphorylation strategies. Herein, the successful development of a SnCl2&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the phosphorylation of alcohols and carbohydrates is demonstrated. Notably, the reaction efficiency is found to be critically dependent on the addition order of SnCl2 and N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine, a phenomenon systematically investigated through mechanistic studies. A one&#8208;pot sequential ketalization/phosphorylation strategy is established for polyol substrates, enabling streamlined access to phosphorylated derivatives. The versatility of this approach is further exemplified by achieving selective phosphorylation/phosphinoylation of carbohydrates.

         <title>Chemoselective Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated Silyl Esters and Silyl Phosphonates Over Cyclopropanation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated silyl esters are an important class of compounds in organic, inorganic and pharmaceutical chemistry, known for their versatility and unique reactivity. The conjugated system in these compounds enables for Michael addition reactions, making them useful intermediates in the synthesis of complex organic/inorganic molecules, including pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and natural products. Having realized the importance of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated silyl esters, we have devised a strategy to synthesize various functionalized allyl and vinyl silanes using diazo compounds and respective silanes. Herein we have demonstrated that the allyl and vinyl silanes can react with diazo compounds in a chemoselective manner offering a versatile method for constructing C&#8208;C bond formation over the cyclopropanation reaction in the presence of 1 mol% of [Cp*RuCl2]n as a catalyst under mild conditions. Direct C&#8208;H bond functionalization of allyl and vinyl silanes with alpha diazo esters and phosphonate diazo showcasing the adaptability of silicon&#8208;based chemistry in modern organic synthesis. The plausible mechanism of the reaction has been realized with the help of DFT calculations. All the synthesized &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated siliyl esters were isolated and characterized by using sophisticated analytical and spectroscopic techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Selenylation of 2&#8208;Alkenylanilines for the Synthesis of 3&#8208;Selanylindoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrosynthesis of valuable 3&#8208;selanylindoles by selenylation of 2&#8208;alkenylanilines under metal&#8208;free and chemical oxidant&#8208;free conditions is described. The reaction involves a radical pathway and features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and straightforward operation.

An electrocatalytic cascade selenylation/oxidation of 2&#8208;alkenylanilines enables the assembly of various 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;selanylindoles in one&#8208;pot under chemical oxidant&#8208;free and transition metal&#8208;free conditions is disclosed. A series of functional 3&#8208;selanylindoles are smoothly furnished in acceptable yields. This electrocatalytic strategy is flexibly suitable for diverse diaryl diselenides and 2&#8208;alkenylanilines. This method is highlighted by broad substrate scope, good functional group compatibility, mild conditions, and easy operation. The preliminarily mechanistic experiments suggest that a radical pathway is probably involved in this protocol.

         <title>Recent Advances in Transition Metal&#8208;Free Strategies for the Transformation of Amides into Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This comprehensive review articulates the recent advances in transition metal&#8208;free methodologies for amide bond activation. By integrating mechanistic insights with synthetic applications, it delineates sustainable strategies for the construction of carbonyl frameworks. Emphasis is placed on nucleophilic substitution, radical&#8208;mediated processes, and catalyst&#8208;driven approaches, providing a valuable resource for the efficient transformation of amides into esters, ketones, imides, and aldehydes.

Amides are fundamental functional groups in organic synthesis and play crucial roles in medicinal chemistry and materials science. Traditionally, amide transformations have often relied on transition metal catalysts; however, recent advances have demonstrated efficient transition metal&#8208;free strategies for amide bond activation. This review provides a comprehensive overview of emerging methodologies that enable selective formation of C&#63743;N, C&#63743;C, C&#63743;O, C&#63743;H, and C&#63743;X bonds. Key developments that offer sustainable and practical alternatives to conventional approaches include borate&#8208; and boronic acid&#8208;mediated transamidations, phosphoric acid&#8208;promoted transformations, and radical&#8208;based strategies. Additionally, nucleophilic substitutions with carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen&#8208;based nucleophiles have expanded the synthetic utility of amides by yielding diverse carbonyl and heterocyclic compounds. Mechanistic insights into these transformations reveal the role of electronic and steric effects in amide reactivity. By categorizing these methodologies based on amide substrates and reaction pathways, this review aims to provide a valuable resource for researchers seeking efficient, metal&#8208;free strategies for amide bond manipulation.

         <title>Phosphorus Heterocycles for Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds exhibit significant potential for applications in electroluminescence, owing to their distinctive electronic structures and varied chemical properties. Phosphorus heterocycles serve multifunctional roles within organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), including as emitters, host matrices, and electron and hole blocking layers, contributing to enhanced device performance. Their intrinsic structural characteristics confer key advantages, including superior thermal stability, high fluorescence quantum yields, and suitable energy level alignment, all of which are essential for optimizing electroluminescent efficiency. Herein, we overview recent progress of electroluminescent phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocyclics materials and discuss their structure property relationships, which would provide insights into expanding the applicability of OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Determination of the Transfer Rate&#160;of Porphyrins from Polysaccharides to Lipid Membranes in the Preparation of Lipid Membranes Incorporating&#160;Porphyrins by the Host&#8208;Exchange Process</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing straightforward and efficient methods for incorporating functional hydrophobic guest molecules into lipid membranes is essential for the application of liposomes as drug delivery systems. In a previous study, we reported the preparation of lipid&#8208;membrane&#8208;incorporated C60, C60 derivatives, and C70 (LMICx) through a host&#8208;exchange method, wherein these molecules were transferred from &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin to liposomes. In this study, we applied a similar host&#8208;exchange approach to prepare lipid&#8208;membrane&#8208;incorporated porphyrins (LMIPors), transferring porphyrins from polysaccharides to liposomes. However, until now, there has been no means to determine the transfer rates. To determine the transfer rates of porphyrins from polysaccharides to liposomes, we developed a method involving the collapse of LMIPors via complex formation between lipids and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin. We believe that this method is general and can be deployed to liposomes incorporating various guest molecules prepared as drug delivery systems on the host&#8208;exchange process.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Ectocarpin A</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully enantioselective total synthesis of ectocarpin A, a new oxylipin, has been achieved in 12 steps starting from tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;cyclopentafuranone. Key steps include the formation of the chiral core, diastereoselective epoxidation, enzymatic desymmetrization of a 1,4&#8208;diol, epimerization, and strategic Wittig and Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefinations to construct the carbon framework.

A total enantioselective synthesis of ectocarpin A, an oxylipin identified through the first hydroperoxide bicyclase activity of CYP5164A3 in brown algae, has been successfully completed in 12 steps starting from tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;cyclopentafuranone. Key transformations include the creation of the chiral tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;cyclopentafuranone, a diastereoselective epoxidation, an enzymatic desymmetrization of a 1,4&#8208;diol, an epimerization, and both Wittig and Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefinations to build the carbon framework of ectocarpin A.

         <title>Oxidative Cyclization of 1,7&#8208;Dienes Induced by &#945;&#8208;Oxyalkyl/Acyl Radicals to Access Functionalized Benzo[b]azepin&#8208;2&#8208;Ones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free oxidative cascade cyclization strategy is presented that enables the efficient transformation of 1,7&#8208;dienes with readily available radical precursors, including alcohols, ethers, and aryl aldehydes, into structurally diverse benzo[b]azepin&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives.

A metal&#8208;free cascade oxidative cyclization method has been developed for synthesizing functionalized benzo[b]azepin&#8208;2&#8208;ones from 1,7&#8208;dienes using alcohols, ethers, or aryl aldehydes. The reaction generates &#945;&#8208;oxyalkyl or acyl radicals by direct C(sp3)&#63743;H or C(sp2)&#63743;H cleavage, avoiding photocatalysts and transition metals. This approach offers a mild strategy for the synthesis of benzo[b]azepine derivatives with high atom economy and efficiency. Mechanistic studies, including radical trapping and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry analysis, confirm a radical&#8208;mediated pathway involving cyclization and single&#8208;electron transfer.

         <title>Total Syntheses of the Linearly&#8208;Fused Prenylated Indole Alkaloids Asperversiamides H and M via Oxidative Rearrangement of the Putative Biosynthetic Precursor Dihydrocarneamide A</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An improved synthesis of the alkaloid dihydrocarneamide A is reported and this has been subjected to a biomimetic&#8208;type oxidative rearrangement using an oxaziridine and so affording the spiro&#8208;oxidole&#8208;containing and prenylated indole alkaloids (PIAs) asperversiamides H and M. This work serves to confirm the structure assigned to the latter. Oxidation of dihydrocarneamide A using m&#8208;chloroperbenzoic (m&#8208;CPBA) afforded an oxidative fragmentation product representing the linear isomer of the PIA amoenamide A and thus a potential "natural product in&#8208;waiting". Furthermore, oxaziridine&#8208;mediated oxidation of the epimer of dihydrocarneamide A (and the enantiomer of the structure assigned to the natural product asperversiamide F) afforded a mixture of two hitherto unreported spiro&#8208;oxindoles.

Certain cytotoxic and anti&#8208;microbial properties of key compounds are reported.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An improved synthesis of the alkaloid dihydrocarneamide A is reported and this has been subjected to a biomimetic-type oxidative rearrangement using an oxaziridine and so affording the spiro-oxidole-containing and prenylated indole alkaloids (PIAs) asperversiamides H and M. This work serves to confirm the structure assigned to the latter. Oxidation of dihydrocarneamide A using m-chloroperbenzoic (m-CPBA) afforded an oxidative fragmentation product representing the linear isomer of the PIA amoenamide A and thus a potential "natural product in-waiting". Furthermore, oxaziridine-mediated oxidation of the epimer of dihydrocarneamide A (and the enantiomer of the structure assigned to the natural product asperversiamide F) afforded a mixture of two hitherto unreported spiro-oxindoles. Given the manner in which these last two products have been formed it seems likely that these, too, are "natural products in-waiting". Certain cytotoxic and anti-microbial properties of key compounds are reported.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Formation of Prenylated Pterocarpans from Synthetically Derived Demethylmedicarpin by Regioselective Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Hydroarylation and Related Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three prenylated pterocarpans including erybraedin A and erybraedin C have been synthesised from (&#177;)&#8208;demethylmedicarpin, itself prepared in four simple steps starting from resorcinol and 2,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenylacetic acid. A gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed and two&#8208;fold intramolecular hydroarylation (IMHA) reaction of a readily&#8208;derived bis&#8208;propargyl ether of (&#177;)&#8208;demethylmedicarpin proceeds with remarkable regio&#8208;selectivity to afford the racemate of a recently reported but yet&#8208;to&#8208;be named bis&#8208;2H&#8208;chromene&#8208;annulated pterocarpan&#8208;containing natural product. A possible explanation for this potentially very useful selectivity is advanced. In a related reaction sequence, a readily&#8208;derived bis&#8208;allyl ether of (&#177;)&#8208;demethylmedicarpin undergoes a thermally&#8208;induced and two&#8208;fold aromatic Claisen rearrangement (ACR) to give a 1:5 mixture of the racemic modifications of the isomeric and cytotoxic natural products erybraedin A and erybraedin C.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Dioxygenation of gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes to Generate &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes are valuable synthetic intermediates in organofluorine chemistry; however, their reactivity often involves intermediates prone to fluorine elimination, leading to monofluorinated products. Here, we present a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed dioxygenation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes with alcohols, which retains both fluorine atoms and yields &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers. This method is operationally simple, employs inexpensive and standard reagents, and demonstrates broad functional group tolerance. The reaction is scalable, enabling the use of the gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropane motif as a masked precursor for &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers in synthetic sequences. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest a radical&#8208;mediated process involving concerted SN2&#8208;like ring&#8208;opening functionalization.</dc:description>
