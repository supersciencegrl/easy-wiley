         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Cascade Radical Cyclization for Difluorochroman&#8208;4&#8208;Ones Via Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of difluorochroman&#8208;4&#8208;ones were gained through facile visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted protocol driven by electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes without any extra transition metals or photocatalysts.







Abstract
The research of electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex has developed fast in the field of photochemistry. Herein, the green and efficient metal&#8208;free visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted synthesis of difluorochroman&#8208;4&#8208;ones has been achieved with 2&#8208;(allyloxy)arylaldehyde and bromodifluoroacetamide, which is driven by noncovalent interactions between 2&#8208;(allyloxy)arylaldehyde/N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylethylene diamine (TMEDA) and bromodifluoroacetamide/TMEDA. By precisely optimizing the electron donor and reaction solvent, a wide range of structurally diverse difluorochroman&#8208;4&#8208;ones, including aryl amide, aliphatic amide and ester groups, were obtained in up to 76&#8201;% yields. This strategy offers the benefits of simple operation, good yields, high atomic economy and broad applicability, providing an essential complement to traditional approaches for the preparation of chroman&#8208;4&#8208;one skeletons without any transition metals, photocatalysts or oxidants.

         <dc:description>A photo&#8208;induced two/three&#8208;component radical difluoroethylation or monofluoromethyl sulfonylation of 2&#8208;amino aryl ethynes was smoothly finished, which gave a series of difluoroethyl or monofluoromethyl sulfonyl seven&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles. The two radical systems featured simple/mild reaction conditions, good substrate scopes, and excellent E/Z selectivity. In addition, various radical intermediates were successfully detected by HRMS to explore the reaction process. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and scaled&#8208;up experiments examined the product scaffold and application of this cyclization system.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of Thiazole&#8208;5&#8208;thione Based on [2 + 3] Annulation Trapping of &#945;&#8208;Keto Sulfine with Thioamide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aiming to develop novel annulation reactions using sulfine intermediates, we have established a regioselective formal [2 + 3] cyclization reaction of &#945;&#8208;keto sulfines generated from the elimination of arylacyl sulfoxides and thioamides. This new strategy allows for the synthesis of thiazole&#8208;5&#8208;thiones directly without catalysts or additives. The approach features a step&#8208;economic, one&#8208;pot characteristics via a tandem sequence of in situ&#945;&#8208;keto sulfines generation, regiospecifically nucleophilic attack or [3 + 2] cyclizatoin, dithioate (S=C&#8722;S&#8722;) skeletons formation, and subsequent intramolecular nucleophilic cyclization. This reaction also represents a novel method for constructing dithioate (S=C&#8722;S&#8722;) skeletons.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced &#960;&#8208;Extension of Perylene Tetraesters: An Investigation on Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present study discloses a highly efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced &#960;&#8208;extension of perylene tetraesters and discussion on the regioselectivity in the photocyclization. We initially found that &#960;&#8208;extension reaction of 3,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl perylene tetraester smoothly proceeded by only irradiating blue LED with a complete regioselectivity. Investigations of the photocyclization with various substrates revealed the relationship between the regioselectivity and electron&#8208;donating/withdrawing effects of the substituents on the aromatic groups. Moreover, theoretical investigation suggested the importance of bond alteration in the aromatic groups: cyclization proceeds preferentially at shorter C&#8208;C bonds with higher double bond characters. The findings will open new possibilities for the practical synthesis of custom&#8208;designed &#960;&#8208;extended perylene materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Organometallic&#8208;Free Approches to the Direct Arylation of Benzoquinones and Naphthoquinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arylquinones are present in many natural and synthetic molecules. They open up possibilities for application in various areas such as pigments and dyes, optical materials, sensors, pharmaceuticals, etc. Many of the methods to obtain them involve indirect arylation routes of precursors and a chemistry of oxidations, reductions, protection and deprotection of functional groups. In this review, direct arylation methods of quinones are compiled with a focus on processes where no C&#8208;metal bonds are formed, i.&#8201;e., organometallic&#8208;free reactions.







Abstract
Quinones represent a ubiquitous class of natural products, extensively distributed throughout nature. Within these organisms, they fulfil pivotal roles across a spectrum of metabolic processes essential to the organisms. Their privileged core structure is present in a variety of substances explored in medicinal chemistry. Modification of the central core of quinones could give rise to new substances with great potential as drug candidates. In this context, the introduction of an aryl or heteroaryl moiety on the quinone structure can be an important strategy for the development of new potentially bioactive compounds. In the present work, direct arylation methods of quinones reported in the literature are summarized, restricting the text to methods where organometallics are not used as catalysts, nor are organometallic species formed during the catalytic cycle. Radical arylation methods are presented where diazonium salts, hydrazines and arylboronic acids are used as aryl radicals&#8217; sources, thermally and photochemically generated. Polar reactions are also presented, that is, through nucleophiles and electrophiles. In most reports, rich aromatics acts as nucleophiles against naphthoquinones, whose electrophilicity is increased by an Br&#246;nsted or Lewis acid. Quinones can be the starting materials or generated in&#8197;situ from phenolic precursors.

         <title>Stable Ditriflates of D&#8208;Glucose in the Synthesis of Iminosugars and Polyhydroxylated Pipecolic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthesis of the iminosugar DAB and a divergent synthesis of 1&#8208;dehydromannojirimycin (DMJ) and the corresponding pipecolic acid are reported. The key step consists of double nucleophilic displacements of a D&#8208;xylose ditriflate by benzyl carbazate and a D&#8208;glucose ditriflate by allyl amine, respectively. This is followed by hydrolysis and oxidation or reduction of the resulting bicyclic glycosides.







Abstract
A synthesis of the five membered iminosugar DAB and a divergent synthesis of the six membered iminosugar 1&#8208;dehydromannojirimycin (DMJ) and the corresponding sugar imino acid are reported. They involve double nucleophilic displacements of a D&#8208;xylose ditriflate by benzyl carbazate and a D&#8208;glucose ditriflate by allyl amine, respectively. They are followed by a similar protocol consisting of hydrolysis and oxidation or reduction of the resulting bicyclic glycosides. This allowed DMJ to be obtained from the cheap sugar D&#8208;glucose.

The key step consists of double nucleophilic displacements of a D-xylose ditriflate by benzyl carbazate and a D-glucose ditriflate by allyl amine, respectively. This is followed by hydrolysis and oxidation or reduction of the resulting bicyclic glycosides.

&lt;p&gt;A synthesis of the five membered iminosugar DAB and a divergent synthesis of the six membered iminosugar 1-dehydromannojirimycin (DMJ) and the corresponding sugar imino acid are reported. They involve double nucleophilic displacements of a D-xylose ditriflate by benzyl carbazate and a D-glucose ditriflate by allyl amine, respectively. They are followed by a similar protocol consisting of hydrolysis and oxidation or reduction of the resulting bicyclic glycosides. This allowed DMJ to be obtained from the cheap sugar D-glucose.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and EPR Studies of Zinc and Copper Tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amines (TPMA) Metal Complexes Containing TEMPO Functionalities</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amines have been used as scaffold for the study of metal organic&#8208;radical interactions using EPR.







Abstract
A new family of stable radical&#8208;containing polytopic ligands based on tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amines TPMA architecture and their corresponding metal complexes have been synthesized. These molecular systems offered the possibility to investigate how various spin carriers, such as the metal ion and the organic radical, influence their EPR properties mainly through the empirical ratio of peak heights d1/d. Moreover, it has been possible to analyze how different conformations of TEMPO radical units in the molecular skeleton affect the metallic system.

         <title>Heavy Atom Quantum Tunnelling in N&#8208;Heterocyclic Pentalenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heavy atom quantum tunnelling is the only possible mechanism for the &#960;&#8208;bond shifting of antiaromatic molecules at cryogenic conditions. N&#8208;derivatives of pentalene show a rich range of tunnelling rates for this degenerate rearrangement reaction.







Abstract
Heavy atom quantum tunnelling was already observed in several &#960;&#8208;bond&#8208;shifting reactions of antiaromatic molecules. In these, their Jahn&#8208;Teller distortions create sharp energy profiles with small atomic trajectories, which are ideal for observing tunnelling. Herein, we studied the effect of the nitrogen in the N&#8208;heterocyclic pentalenes, distinguishing between isothermic and exothermic reactions. The reactivity was not easily predictable, with our computations revealing a wide variability of rates, from the complete cancellation of the barrier to high isomer stability. For all these systems, quantum tunnelling emerged as the most significant mechanism at room temperature and the only valid one at cryogenic conditions.

         <title>1,2&#8208;Diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;Dienes as a Multifaceted Synthons for the Synthesis of Heterocycles: A Fifteen&#8208;Years Update</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,2&#8208;Diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadienes, also called azoalkenes, have received considerable attention as key synthons for constructing various heterocyclic scaffolds. This minireview summarizes the contribution of our group in this field over the period from 2009 to the present, focusing on the role of the azoene building block in forming the heterocyclic structures.







Abstract
The discovery of structurally unique scaffolds entities with increased complexity and balanced physicochemical properties has the potential to allow synthetic chemists to exploit areas of chemical space that were previously inaccessible. Among the different strategies employed for generating N&#8208;heterocycles, cyclization and cycloaddition reactions represent a valuable synthetic tool. The purpose of this minireview is to summarize the recent advances (2009&#8208;present) from our laboratory on the generation of intriguing five&#8208;, six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered mono&#8208; or poly&#8208;heterocyclic architectures (linear, fused and spiro) employing 1,2&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes (DDs) as key synthons.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Thioamides via Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Thiocarbamoyl Fluorides and Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot synthetic method from amines and boronic acids has been developed to get access to thioamides. The success of this transformation relies on Ni&#8208;catalyzed coupling of thiocarbamoyl fluorides and boronic acids. This novel reaction feature with good functional group tolerance, mild conditions and providing a variety of thioamides in good yields.







Abstract
A novel and efficient one&#8208;pot method has been developed for the synthesis of thioamides through coupling reactions between thiocarbamoyl fluorides, which are generated in&#8197;situ from amines, and boronic acids. The key to the success of this transformation lies in the use of nickel a catalyst combined with PCy3 as a ligand. This innovative reaction protocol provides mild reaction conditions suitable for producing a diverse array of thioamides, and the late&#8208;stage modification of amoxapine was successfully achieved.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed umpolung nucleophilic allylation of isatin&#8208;derived azomethine imines with vinylcyclopropanes was developed, affording a wide range of structurally privileged quaternary 3&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;aminooxindoles in moderate to good yields with excellent linear&#8208;selectivities.







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed umpolung allylation of isatin&#8208;derived azomethine imines with vinyl cyclopropanes was disclosed. This protocol provides an efficient and atom&#8208;economic approach to access an array of structurally interesting allylic aminooxindole derivatives in good yields and linear&#8208;selectivities (up to 95&#8201;% yield). Further product derivatization and asymmetric catalytic studies proved the practicability of reaction and potential application.

         <title>N&#8208;Arylphenothiazines and N,N&#8208;Diarylphenazines as Tailored Organophotoredox Catalysts for the Reductive Activation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of strongly reducing organophotocatalysts is synthesized and evaluated for the photocatalytic activation of olefins without any sacrificial reagents or electrochemistry. Their opto&#8208;electronic properties and suitability as organophotoredox catalysts is investigated using the addition of methanol to a&#8208;methylstyrene as a model reaction. The results are supported by spectroelectrochemistry and DFT calculations.







Abstract
A small library of N&#8208;arylphenothiazines, N&#8208;arylbenzo[b]phenothiazines and N,N&#8208;diarylphenazines has been synthesized as strongly reducing organophotocatalysts without the need for sacrificial reagents or electrochemistry. Their opto&#8208;electronic properties and their suitability as organophotoredox catalysts for the efficient activation of olefins was investigated using the addition of methanol to &#945;&#8208;methylstyrene as a model reaction. The findings were supported by DFT calculations. Three photocatalysts were identified that allowed quantitative yields with 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst loading and 20&#8197;h irradiation by a 365&#8197;nm LED. The catalyst loading was gradually reduced to 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% and the irradiation time was reduced to only 20&#8197;min. These experiments revealed that N,N&#8208;diisobutyl&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;(10H&#8208;phenothiazin&#8208;10&#8208;yl)&#8208;[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;amine is the most efficient photocatalyst among the N&#8208;arylphenothiazines. This chromophore combines high electron density introduced by the diisobutylamino phenyl group with high absorptivity at 365&#8197;nm caused by the phenylene bridge to the phenothiazine core. In an attempt to shift the excitation wavelength into the visible light range for selectivity and sustainability purposes (potential use of sunlight as a light source), N&#8208;arylbenzo[b]phenothiazines N,N&#8208;diarylphenazines were designed that exhibit a red&#8208;shifted and broad absorbance shoulder into the visible range, but only N,N&#8208;diarylphenazines allow photocatalysis and the one&#8208;electron activation of alkenes by visible light (450&#8197;nm LED).

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Fluorenes: Recent Developments and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioenriched fluorene derivatives have long captivated chemists due to their potential applications in medicinal chemistry, synthetic chemistry, and materials science. However, the chiral separation of racemic fluorenes remains the primary method for obtaining these optically pure molecules. This mini&#8208;review summarizes and discusses fifteen years of developments in the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral fluorenes.







Abstract
The chiral fluorene fragment constitutes one of the most important scaffolds frequently found in numerous bioactive molecules, ligands, and advanced functional materials due to its unique physical properties. In this context, various transition metal&#8208; and organo&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reactions have been developed to prepare chiral fluorenes with high optical purity. In the present mini&#8208;review, we summarize fifteen years of achievements in the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral fluorenes and their derivatives. Particular attention is given to the strategies used and mechanistic aspects of some significant reactions. Moreover, the cutting&#8208;edge developments in the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of silafluorenes are also highlighted.

         <dc:description>N&#8208;Sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles are valuable precursors for the generation of &#945;&#8208;imino carbene intermediates in the presence of the metal catalysts, especially rhodium(II) complexes. Due to the presence of electrophilic carbene and nucleophilic nitrogen, these reactive intermediates can easily be incorporated into many annulations, cycloadditions, C&#8208;H or O/N/S&#8208;H bond insertions and functionalization reactions. A large number of pharmaceutically important nitrogen&#8208;based building blocks can be constructed via this direct and atom&#8208;economical carbene strategy.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new environmentally friendly and efficient strategy for preparing trifluoromethylated pyrrolidones has been developed. The process involves using visible light to induce radical cyclization of 1,5&#8208;dienes with CF3SO2Na, resulting in excellent regioselectivity. This method uses less expensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;store trifluoromethylation reagents, making it an attractive option. Additionally, the resulting trifluoromethylated pyrrolidones can be easily modified and preliminary mechanistic studies have been presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of Alkenes via Chalcogen Bond: Chalcogen&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; Bond Catalyzed the Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction of 2&#8208;Vinylindoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogen bond catalysis is a promising catalytic strategy, characterized by its environmental friendliness, relatively inexpensive cost, and similar reactivity to transition metal catalysis. Experimental results suggest that the S&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; and Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; bonds can efficiently drive the vinyl&#8208;indole&#8208;based Diels&#8208;Alder reaction (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2021, 60, 9395&#8208;9400). In this work, chalcogen bond catalysis in the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between 2&#8208;vinylindoles has been investigated based on density functional theory. For this reaction, the Te&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; bond catalysis is as an alternative catalytic strategy. The Diels&#8208;Alder reaction catalyzed by chalcogen bond is stepwise and involves two steps: the carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation process and the cyclization process. The cyclization process is the rate&#8208;determining step. From the perspective of energy decomposition analysis, the electrostatic interaction is the main factor to cause Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; bond catalysis, the polarization interaction is the main factor to cause Te&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; bond catalysis. Additionally, this catalytic reaction involves the endo pathway and exo pathway. The Gibbs free energy barrier values of the endo pathway are lower than those of the exo pathway, which facilitates the formation of the endo product. This study will provide a valuable perspective on the application of chalcogen bond in the activation of alkenes.</dc:description>

         <title>2&#8208;Methylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines (2&#8208;pyNHOs): Highly Nucleophilic Enamines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 39, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Methylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines (2&#8208;pyNHOs) are enamines with strongly polarized exocyclic &#960;&#8208;bond. The 2&#8208;pyNHOs react with quinone methides to give zwitterionic adducts or the entirely neutral adduct tautomers. The kinetics of 2&#8208;pyNHO/electrophile reactions were studied and evaluated by the Mayr&#8208;Patz equation. With nucleophilicities N from 19.4 to 21.2, 2&#8208;pyNHOs are significantly more reactive than classical enamines.







Abstract
The high reactivity of 2&#8208;methylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines also known as 2&#8208;methylpyridinium derived N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (2&#8208;pyNHOs) has been recognized in organic synthesis, yet a quantification of their nucleophilicity is lacking. Herein we used stopped&#8208;flow photometry to determine the nucleophilicity of a series of 2&#8208;pyNHOs from the kinetics of their reactions with quinone methides and benzhydrylium ions as reference electrophiles in four organic solvents at 20&#8201;&#176;C. The kinetic data was evaluated by using the Mayr&#8208;Patz equation, lg&#8201;k(20&#8201;&#176;C)=sN(N+E), which gave nucleophilicity parameters N (and sN). With N in the range of 19.4&#8211;21.2 (in DMSO), 2&#8208;pyNHOs exceed the reactivity of classical enamines, such as pyrrolidino&#8208;cyclopent&#8208;1&#8208;ene. The addition of 2&#8208;pyNHOs to quinone methides resulted in the formation of zwitterionic adducts with pyridinium and phenolate moieties. Subsequent tautomerization yielded entirely neutral pyridine&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ylidene&#8208;phenol species in several cases. Formation of the zwitterionic adducts from 2&#8208;pyNHOs and neutral electrophiles was almost equally fast in the polar solvents acetonitrile and DMSO, but proceeded one to two orders of magnitude slower in the less polar solvents dichloromethane or THF.

&lt;p&gt;2-Methylene-1,2-dihydropyridines (2-pyNHOs) are enamines with strongly polarized exocyclic &#960;-bond.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 39, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axially chiral arylisoxazoles with high yields (up to 96&#8201;%) and excellent enantiomeric purities (up to 97&#8201;% ee) were synthesized through organocatalytic arylation of isoxazoles with N&#8208;Cbz&#8208;protected azonaphthalenes. Cbz protecting group can be readily removed, resulting in axially chiral heterobiaryl amines bearing free amine maintaining enantiomeric purity.







Abstract
An enantioselective arylation of isoxazoles with N&#8208;Cbz&#8208;protected azonaphthalenes is disclosed, affording a range of axially chiral arylisoxazoles in good yields and excellent enantiocontrol by utilizing chiral phosphoric acid. Cbz protecting group can be readily removed, resulting in five&#8208;six membered axially chiral heterobiaryl amines bearing free amine maintaining enantiomeric purity.

         <title>A Concise Ring Closing Enyne Metathesis Approach for the Preparation of Functionalized Proline&#8208;Derived Azabicycloalkane Amino Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 39, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constrained C4&#8208;functionalized dipeptide derivatives incorporating a proline moiety were prepared in high yields by exploiting a direct ring closing enyne metathesis (RCEYM) reaction. Post&#8208;functionalization studies of the newly introduced diene system pave the way for future applications in peptide synthesis, medicinal chemistry and nanotechnology.







Abstract
Herein we report the preparation of C4&#8208;functionalized proline&#8208;derived azabicycloalkane (Aba) amino acids by exploiting a direct ring closing enyne metathesis reaction of readily accessible dipeptide precursors. The reverse&#8208;turn inducing properties of the newly synthesized constrained dipeptide mimics were assessed by computational studies. Furthermore, the desired Aba derivatives, carrying a synthetically versatile diene moiety, were subjected to post&#8208;functionalization reactions to validate their potential application in peptide/peptidomimetic chemistry and drug discovery.

         <title>Reduction and Hydrocyanation of Aziridines with C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 39, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unusual C&#8722;C bond cleavage of 2,3&#8208;diaryl aziridines took place to afford secondary amines by formal dihydrogenation and hydrocyanation. Formal dehydrogenation was performed by electrocyclic ring opening of N&#8208;Li or N&#8208;Na aziridines to azaallyl anions followed by reduction with NaBH4. Formal hydrocyanation was realized by treating azaallyl anions with Me3SiCN.







Abstract
The carbon&#8208;carbon bond in three&#8208;membered ring of 2,3&#8208;diaryl aziridines was reductively cleaved to give the corresponding dibenzylamine derivatives by electrocyclic ring opening of N&#8208;Li or N&#8208;Na aziridines followed by reduction of the 2&#8208;azaallyl anion formed with sodium borohydride in ethanol. Hydrocyanation of the 2&#8208;azaallyl anion with trimethylsilyl cyanide gave a secondary amine bearing a cyano group at the benzylic position.

     alt="Reduction and Hydrocyanation of Aziridines with C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Unusual C&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;&lt;i&gt;C bond cleavage of 2,3-diaryl aziridines took place to afford secondary amines by formal dihydrogenation and hydrocyanation. Formal dehydrogenation was performed by electrocyclic ring opening of N-Li or N-Na aziridines to azaallyl anions followed by reduction with NaBH4. Formal hydrocyanation was realized by treating azaallyl anions with Me3SiCN&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The carbon-carbon bond in three-membered ring of 2,3-diaryl aziridines was reductively cleaved to give the corresponding dibenzylamine derivatives by electrocyclic ring opening of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Li or &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Na aziridines followed by reduction of the 2-azaallyl anion formed with sodium borohydride in ethanol. Hydrocyanation of the 2-azaallyl anion with trimethylsilyl cyanide gave a secondary amine bearing a cyano group at the benzylic position. The effects of substituents on the electrocyclic ring opening of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Li aziridines were also clarified.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemoselective Synthesis of Cyanoformamides from Isocyanates and a Highly Reactive Nitrile Anion Reservoir</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 39, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoselective preparation of cyanoformamides from widely available isocyanates and a reactive silyl cyanide&#8211;as the competent nucleophilic CN anion &#8211; is reported. The methodology requires the use of a suitable Lewis base (potassium tert&#8208;pentoxide) for the proper activation of the cyanide donor.







Abstract
The direct addition of a nitrile anion to isocyanates is reported for a straightforward preparation of valuable cyanoformamides. Through the proper activation of an adequate silicon&#8208;ate complex precursor (PhMe2SiCN) with a Lewis base (potassium tert&#8208;amylate) under Barbier&#8208;type conditions, the cyanide was instantaneously released, thus yielding the desired motif with full chemocontrol. No particular structural restriction was noticed for engaging in the transformation a wide series of commercially available isocyanates.

         <title>Room Temperature Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Ullmann Reaction of (Hetero)aryl/Vinyl Chlorides Enabled by Silylchloride&#8208;Activated Mn Powders</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 39, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pre&#8208;activation of Mn powers by trimethylsilylchloride (TMSCl) enables a highly efficient Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive homocoupling of (hetero)aryl/vinyl chlorides in DMA at room temperature to afford symmetrical biaryls/dienes in good to excellent yields although TMSCl plays a double&#8208;face role, activating Mn but deactivating Ni catalyst.







Abstract
A room temperature Ni&#8208;catalyzed Mn&#8208;mediated homocoupling of (hetero)aryl and vinyl chlorides using Mn powders pre&#8208;activated by trimethylsilylchloride (TMSCl) in DMA is reported. Large steric effects were observed while electronic influences from aryl chlorides proved to be rather small. High regioselectivity could be achieved between ortho&#8208;Cl and para&#8208;Cl/Br of aryl halides benefiting from the large steric effects. A double&#8208;face role of TMSCl, i.&#8201;e. activation of Mn powders but deactivation of nickel catalyst, was observed although TMSCl&#8208;activated Mn powders appeared to be the privileged metallic reductant. Applications of the protocol have been demonstrated in a multigram synthesis of Daclatasvir.

This review showcases various instances of domino transformations applied to carbohydrates, with the goal of summarizing their chemical potential in producing sugar&#8208;derived compounds. These compounds have significant applications in generating new chemical scaffolds for drug discovery and chemical biology.







Abstract
The intricate nature of carbohydrate structures has prompted the scientific community to seek efficient protocols for their manipulation. Lengthy synthetic pathways, often necessary to achieve complex sugar structures, pose challenges not only in terms of time and cost but also regarding environmental sustainability. Consequently, domino transformations serve as valuable tools in streamlining drug discovery processes. Sequential procedures involving fewer steps and minimal isolation/purification steps are particularly appealing to organic chemists in the field of carbohydrate chemistry. This review highlights several examples of domino transformations applied to carbohydrates, aiming to summarize their chemical potential in delivering sugar&#8208;based compounds with significant applications in the generation of new chemical scaffolds for drug discovery and chemical biology.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure and Properties of Core&#8208;Modified Calixporphyrinoids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 39, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis, structure, coordination, spectroscopic properties and applications of core&#8208;modified calix(n)phyrins that are resulted by replacing one or more pyrrole rings of calix(n)phyrins with different heterocycles such as thiophene, selenophene, tellurophene, phosphole, silole and so on and carbacycles such as m&#8208;/p&#8208;phenylene rings are described in this review.







Abstract
Calix[n]porphyrinoids containing both sp2 and sp3 meso&#8208;carbons can bind metals like porphyrinoids and anions like calix[n]pyrroles. Thus, calix[n]porphyrinoids are hybrid macrocycles of porphyrinoids and calix[n]pyrroles. The core&#8208;modified calix[n]porphyrinoids resulted by replacing one or more pyrroles of calix[n]porphyrinoids with different heterocycles or carbacycles that possesses very attractive structural, spectral, and coordination properties. For the past two decades, several different types of core&#8208;modified calix[n]porphyrinoids in which one or more pyrroles were replaced with other heterocycles such as thiophene, selenophene, tellurophene, silole, phosphole, pyridine, etc and carbacycles such as m/p&#8208;phenylene have been synthesized and explored their structure, metal coordination and anion sensing properties. This review describes different synthetic strategies used for the synthesis of various types of core&#8208;modified calix[4]phyrins and expanded calix[n]phyrins and discusses their key structural aspects, properties, coordination chemistry and applications.

         <title>Non&#8208;Reductive CO2 Valorization into Oxazolidinones via Cycloaddition to Aziridines: A Personal Insight</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 39, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective provides an overview of recent homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic methodologies published on the CO2 cycloaddition to aziridines to form oxazolidinones, with a particular attention to the employed experimental conditions, which are essential parameters for envisioning real costs and possible applications of these synthetic processes.







Abstract
This perspective discusses bibliography data that has been published since 2018 on the synthesis of oxazolidinones by reacting corresponding aziridines with CO2. The versatility and viability of various procedures have been analyzed by considering the variety of tested substrates as well as experimental conditions and catalytic systems used. Collected data highlights that the reaction can be effectively promoted by several homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems that have been optimized in order to conjugate the process sustainability and productivity with convenient procedural costs.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Double Cyclizations Involving an Aza&#8208;Prins Process</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 39, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review are discussed one&#8208;pot domino/cascade/tandem bis&#8208;cyclizations involving an aza&#8208;Prins process, for poly azacycles synthesis. Those are fused, bridged or spiranic depending on the position of the nucleophile. The mechanism of the two steps together with the stereochemical outcomes are detailed.







Abstract
Piperidine derivatives are highly abundant in natural products and pharmaceutically relevant compounds. Aza&#8208;Prins cyclization has emerged as a step&#8208; atom&#8208;economical and stereoselective method for the preparation of such azacycles. The possibility of coupling aza&#8208;Prins process with the formation of a second cycle in a one&#8208;pot manner is even more powerful and makes the object of this review. Cascade/domino/tandem bis&#8208;cyclizations involving an aza&#8208;Prins process, for the rapid construction of complex small molecules, are discussed in detail.

         <title>Computation&#8208;Guided Scope Exploration of a Conjugate Addition/Truce&#8208;Smiles Cascade Reaction for Scaffold Diversification</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on the successful application of a nitroaryl transfer cascade reaction in the total synthesis of various monoterpene indole alkaloids proceeding via fused bicyclic intermediate, we investigated analogous cascade reactions involving spiro, bridged, and alternatively fused bicyclic intermediates. Unfortunately, none of these was found to afford the desired nitroaryl transfer product. DFT studies of the original cascade process revealed that the Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement is the rate&#8208;determining step. In addition, we found that the subsequent SO2 extrusion is accompanied by retro&#8208;Mannich ring opening, resulting in a stabilized enolate that only recyclizes after activation of the cyclic imine moiety. Computation of the reaction profiles of the proposed alternative cascade reactions showed that the barrier for the Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement is unreasonably high for the bridged and alternatively fused systems, but only moderately higher for the five&#8208;membered spiro system. Reasoning that even more electron&#8208;deficient arenesulfonamides should have a lower barrier for the Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement, we synthesized the corresponding 2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzenesulfonamide precursor and found that it indeed smoothly undergoes the nitroaryl transfer cascade at room temperature. In this case, however, the cascade reaction produces a cyclic imine product, as the intermediate 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenyl&#8208;substituted enolate is insufficiently nucleophilic to undergo the Mannich cyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Various Dihydro&#8211;Thiazole and Selenazole Heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of thiazole derivatives was achieved by reacting I2/SCN&#8722; with various push&#8208;pull alkenes. The substitution followed by intramolecular cyclization under mild conditions resulted in the desired products. When KSeCN was used, a selenazole derivative was formed.







Abstract
We prepared numerous thiazole derivatives from push&#8208;pull alkenes such as nitroenamines, enaminoester, and enaminonitrils in a two&#8208;step reaction with thiocyanate ion. The first step was the formation of the thiocyanate&#8208;substituted push&#8208;pull alkene from an iodine&#8208;containing intermediary. We demonstrated this sequence through the preparation and identification of the iodine&#8208;substituted enamines. In the second step, thiazole ring closure took place in methanol, at room temperature. The imino group of the condensed thiazole ring systems was successfully acylated. The same reaction sequence with potassium selenocyanate resulted in two selenocyanate and a selenazole heterocyclic derivatives. The mechanism of the reaction with thiocyanate ion and the heterocycle formation was investigated by computational methods. We performed quantum chemical calculations, involving both the thermodynamic and the kinetic aspects of the ring closure reaction.

         <title>Catalyzing the Enantioselective Tail&#8208;to&#8208;Head Terpene Cyclization Inside Optically Active Hexameric Resorcin[4]arene Capsules: A Surprising Odd&#8208;Even Effect of the Catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the enantioselective tail&#8208;to&#8208;head terpene cyclization inside hexameric capsules self&#8208;assembled from optically active resorcin[4]arene derivatives. An unexpected odd&#8208;even effect was uncovered, where the enantioselectivity of the reaction depended on the number of methylene units present on the linear alkyl chain connected to the resorcin[4]arene derivative.







Abstract
Terpenes, created in Nature via tail&#8208;to&#8208;head terpene (THT) cyclizations, have long fascinated chemists due to their complex structures and biological activities. Recreating such THT cyclizations in the laboratory using man&#8208;made catalysts has been challenging. Especially difficult is performing the reaction in an enantioselective fashion, as the substrate is flexible and does not contain much functionality to form strong interactions with the chiral catalyst. This study explores the enantioselective THT cyclization inside hexameric capsules self&#8208;assembled from optically active resorcin[4]arene derivatives. An unexpected odd&#8208;even effect, where the enantioselectivity of the reaction depended on the length of the alkyl chain attached to the resorcin[4]arene capsule was uncovered. To our knowledge, this is the first example of an odd&#8208;even effect in the catalyst itself, and also the first instance in which this effect is related to the enantioselectivity of the reaction.

         <title>Aerobic Oxidative Synthesis of N&#8208;Containing Heterocycles from o&#8208;Substituted Aniline Derivatives and Primary Amines by Perylene Diimide Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative cyclization of o&#8208;substituted aniline derivatives with primary amines for the synthesis of benzimidazoles, benzothiazoles, and quinoxalines with oxygen as the terminal oxidant, the method used the commercially available organocatalyst PTCDI as a heterogeneous catalyst and can be recycled six times without significant loss of catalytic activity.







Abstract
The commercially available 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI) acted as a heterogeneous catalyst to catalyze aerobic oxidative synthesis of benzimidazoles, benzothiazoles, and quinoxalines from o&#8208;substituted aniline derivatives and primary amines in high yields with oxygen as the terminal oxidant. The gram scale reaction and reusability (up to six cycles) of the PTCDI catalyst were also successful and would greatly benefit industrial applications.

         <title>On Water: Diastereoselective Synthesis of Functionalized 3&#8208;Nitrodihydroquinolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;ones Under Catalyst&#8208;Free Conditions</title>

         <dc:description>
This article describes a greener methodology for the stereoselective synthesis of functionalized 3&#8208;nitrodihydroquinolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;one and their deuterium analogues using an uncatalyzed imine formation&#8208;cyclization approach with good yields on the greenest solvent, water/heavy water. Additionally, we demonstrated the synthetic utility of 3&#8208;nitrodihydroquinolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;ones by reducing the keto and nitro groups.







Abstract
Herein we describe an uncatalyzed and eco&#8208;friendly methodology for the diastereoselective synthesis of 3&#8208;nitro dihydroquinolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;ones through an imine formation&#8208;cyclization reaction on water medium. Water is an essential medium to effect this reaction efficiently without any catalyst. In addition, the synthesis of deuterium labelled 3&#8208;nitrodihydroquinolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;ones has been accomplished using this protocol. The key characteristics of this approach include catalyst free, scalable, mild reaction condition, easy isolation, and greenest solvent medium.

         <title>Utilization of Hypervalent Bonds as a Novel Strategy for Manipulating Energy Levels of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique optical properties created by the combination of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems and hypervalent bonds are summarized. The hypervalent bond, a polarized three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8722;4e) bond, simultaneously provides electron&#8208;donating and withdrawing effects to &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. The hypervalent compounds have a narrow energy gap for NIR emission and stimuli&#8208;responsive chromism through the reversible coordination&#8208;number shift of the central main&#8208;group elements.







Abstract
The unique optical properties created by the combination of azobenzene&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems and hypervalent bonds are summarized. The hypervalent bond, a polarized three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8722;4e) bond, simultaneously provides electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing effects to the directly attached &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. The resulting hypervalent compounds have a dramatically narrow energy gap showing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission despite the limited size of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. In addition, the hypervalent compounds also exhibit stimuli&#8208;responsive chromism through the reversible coordination&#8208;number shift of the central main&#8208;group elements in both crystals and &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer films. We also explain that the nature of hypervalent bonds depends on the element type, which is particularly effective in bringing out the properties of heavy elements. In this review, we describe that the use of hypervalent bonds is a novel strategy not only for manipulating the energy levels of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system but also for developing a variety of functional materials based on the newly rising properties from hypervalent element.

         <title>Gilding the Lily: Studies on the Effects of Successive Loading of Light Energy&#8208;Storing Molecules with Norbornadiene Units</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photochromic norbornadiene&#8208;quadricyclane cycle has emerged as a promising basis for molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage. In this context, it has been estab&#173;lished that multifunctional photoswitches with several norborna&#173;diene units at one central aromatic core have favorable photochemical properties and storage capacities. Nevertheless, a maximum number of three norbornadiene units has been combined in one molecule, so far. In this work, scope and limits of this approach should be further assessed. Thus, exemplary polyfunctionalized derivatives have been synthesized by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions, and their suitability for MOST applications was investigated. These compounds were converted into the correspon&#173;ding quadricyclanes by direct UV irradiation (&#955;ex&#160;=&#160;315&#160;nm) with moderate quantum yields, whereas the reaction is more efficient upon irradiation with &#955;ex&#160;=&#160;520 nm in the presence of photosensitizers. But these molecules showed low stabilities and short half&#8208;lifes of 1 to 2 days. Moreover, the photo&#173;chemical reaction is hampered by the close vicinity of photoactive units. Therefore, it appears that in such assemblies, a maximum number of three norbornadiene units is the limit to keep the optimal balance of photochemical properties required for MOST applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A rapid metal&#8208;free approach describing one&#8208;pot thiocyanation of chromone and coumarin enabling tandem cyclization via potassium thiocyanate as a sulfur surrogate was unveiled. Interestingly, this enaminone&#8208;mediated protocol facilitated straightforward access to medicinally significant 2&#8208;amino/imino thiazolo fused chromone and coumarin frameworks. This methodology provided good atom&#8208;economy, remarkable functional group tolerance, and scalability. Alongside establishing a wide substrate scope, it also provided a feasible&#160;scalability up to gram scale.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Two cycloaddition modes of isoquinolinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolates have been established. Upon choosing &#945;&#8208;bromo ketones as the counterpart, a range of isoquinoline&#8208;fused thiazines can be attained with yields ranging from moderate to excellent through a formal [5 + 1] reaction pathway, exhibiting remarkable substrate adaptability and resilience to diverse functional groups. Additionally, a library of unprecedented thiazepino[5,4&#8208;a]isoquinolines, a novel category of seven&#8208;membered heterocycles, has been synthesized via a [5 + 2] pathway utilizing acetylenedicarboxylate as the reactive component.

         <title>Ratiometric Fluorescence Depending on In/Out Isomerism of Host&#8208;Guest Conjugate Having a Fluorosolvatochromic Dye</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Host&#8208;guest conjugate HG1, comprising tetraaza[2.2.1.2.2.1]paracyclophane CPX2 and a fluorosolvatochromic dye G1 linked by an oxyethylene chain, was synthesized. HG1 has two conformations: In&#8208;form and Out&#8208;form. The two conformations showed different fluorescent colors due to changes in the surrounding environment of the fluorosolvatochromic dye. HG1 performs as a ratiometric fluorophore depending on the in/out isomerism of the host&#8208;guest conjugate.







Abstract
Host&#8208;guest conjugate is a promising strategy for providing outstanding molecules. Herein, we designed host&#8208;guest conjugate HG1, which comprises a hydrophilic host unit, tetraaza[2.2.1.2.2.1]paracyclophane CPX2 with a microhydrophobic cavity, and a guest unit, 2,3&#8208;naphthalimide fused with two benzothiophenes G1 exhibiting fluorosolvatochromism, linked with an oxyethylene chain. HG1 initially showed a fluorescence band at 585&#8197;nm in MeOH/H2O (1/499 v/v); however, this band decreased with time, and instead, a new band at 430&#8197;nm appeared. The CIE chromaticity diagram showed that the fluorescent color changed from yellow&#8208;orange to blue via white. NMR analysis of HG1 in methanol&#8208;d4 exhibited different signals of the G1 unit between the blue and yellow fluorescent structures. The blue fluorescent structures showed asymmetrical signals assigned as the G1 unit, affected by the cavity environment of the CPX2 unit. Consequently, HG1 can form two conformations: In&#8208;form and Out&#8208;form. In In&#8208;form, the G1 unit is inside the hydrophobic cavity of the CPX2 unit and shows blue fluorescence. In Out&#8208;form, the G1 unit is outside the CPX2 unit and shows yellow fluorescence in an aqueous solvent. Therefore, HG1 performs as a ratiometric fluorophore depending on the in/out isomerism of the host&#8208;guest conjugate.

         <dc:description>
A convenient synthetic protocol for diverse functionalized dihydrobenzofuran&#8208;fused spirocyclopentane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diindolin&#8208;ones with high diastereoselectivity is developed by base promoted domino annulation reaction of MBH carbonates of isatins and 3&#8208;(o&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene)indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones. The relative configurations of the various polycyclic compounds are clearly elucidated by determination eight single crystal structures.







Abstract
The diverse functionalized dihydrobenzofuran&#8208;fused spirocyclopentane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diindolin&#8208;one scaffolds were conveniently synthesized by base promoted domino cyclization reaction of MBH (Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillmann) carbonates of isatins and 3&#8208;(o&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene)indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones. The base promoted reactions of MBH maleimides of isatins and MBH formates of isatins with 3&#8208;(o&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene)indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones afforded polycyclic dispiro[indoline&#8208;3,4&#8242;&#8208;benzofuro[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:1,5]cyclopenta[1,2&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;5&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;indolines] and dispiro[indoline&#8208;3,1&#8242;&#8208;cyclopenta[b]benzofuran&#8208;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;indolines] in good yields and with high diastereoselectivity. More importantly, DMAP facilitated annulation reaction of MBH nitriles of isatins and 3&#8208;(o&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene)indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones selectively resulted in dispiro[indoline&#8208;3,1&#8242;&#8208;cyclopentane&#8208;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;indolines], while Cs2CO3 promoted reaction gave dispiro[indoline&#8208;3,1&#8242;&#8208;cyclopenta[b]benzofuran&#8208;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;indolines] in high yields and with high diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Toward Multi&#8208;Functionalized Organogermaniums: Diastereoselective Transformations of Germacycles Derived from Cheletropic Reactions of Boron&#8208;Substituted Butadienes with Ge(II) Salts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The (4+1) cycloadditions of the boron&#8208;substituted butadienes with Ge(II) salts afforded the carbon&#8208;based germacycles. The obtained germacycles behaved as allylboronic nucleophiles and were applied to further allylboration of aldehydes with perfect diastereoselectivity. The obtained allylated adducts enabled access to &#960;&#8208;extended organogermaniums with the retention of the stereocenters.







Abstract
The field of organogermanium in chemistry has recently attracted attention. Thanks to the inherent features of germanium (Ge), introducing Ge&#8208;based substituents into organic frameworks has enhanced bioactivity and optoelectronic properties of molecules. Herein, the synthesis of multi&#8208;functionalized organogermaniums using Ge(II) salts is reported. The germacycles having an allylboron moiety, which is derived from the (4+1) cycloadditions of the butadienes bearing a boronic ester moiety with Ge(II) salts, can be applied to further allylboration of aldehydes with perfect diastereoselectivity. The obtained allylated adducts enable access to &#960;&#8208;extended organogermaniums with the retention of the stereocenters.

         <title>Nitrile&#8208;Stabilized Quaternary Ammonium Ylide as an Arylcyanomethylene Transfer Agent: Diastereoselective Synthesis of Spiro&#8208;Cyanocyclopropyl&#8208;2&#8208;Oxindoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diastereoselective cyclopropanation of nitrile&#8208;stabilized quaternary ammonium ylide with a weakly activated conjugated carboxamide functional motif is reported, which provides an efficient access to biologically relevant spiro&#8208;cyanocyclopropane oxindoles, while sigmatropic rearrangement process of the ylide is commonly known.







Abstract
Nitrile&#8208;stabilized quaternary ammonium ylide as an effective aryl&#8208;cyanomethylene transfer agent has been explored for the first time, which enables a spirocyclopropanation process with conjugated carboxamide of indole heterocycle. The developed In(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed method provides a straightforward, diastereoselective access to pharmaceutically relevant spiro&#8208;cyclopropane&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole skeleton assembled with an &#945;&#8208;cyano and two (hetero)aromatic substitutions. The common difficulties of a cyclopropanation process, e.&#8201;g., a conjugated carboxamide as valid substrate, cleavage&#8208;susceptibility of amide bond, substrates scope limited to preferentially electron&#8208;withdrawing group containing molecules, and the competing dehydrocyanation reaction of product generated from nitrile&#8208;stabilized ylide have been overcome in the present spirocyclopropanation process.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Induced and PIFA Enabled [4+2] Annulation of Alkenes with N&#8208;Aryl Substituted Hydroxamic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a visible&#8208;light irradiation and PIFA oxidized [4+2] annulation of alkenes with N&#8208;aryl substituted hydroxamic acids as the amidoxyl radical precursors was report. The reaction provides a new approach toward ben&#8208;zo[c][1,2]oxazines. A series of alkenes and N&#8208;aryl substituted hydroxamic acids worked well under the reaction conditions, affording the desired products in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
In this paper, we reported a facile approach for the preparation of benzo[c][1,2]oxazine scaffolds via visible light induced phenyl iodine bis(trifluoroacetate) (PIFA) oxidative [4+2] annulation of vinyl benzenes with N&#8208;aryl substituted hydroxamic acids. In the transformation, amidoxyl radicals are readily generated via covalent I&#8722;O bond formation and photo&#8208;induced I&#8722;O cleavage from N&#8208;aryl substituted hydroxamic acids, and their coupling with vinyl arenes in the form of [4+2] annulation delivers benzo[c]&#8208;[1,2]oxazines derivatives. This reaction proceeds in the absence of transition metals and catalysts, exhibiting broad substrate scope of both alkenes and N&#8208;aryl substituted hydroxamic acids.

         <title>Tandem Knoevenagel&#8208;Aldol Cyclization Towards Di and Trisubstituted Pyridines: Use of Malonaldehyde and Diethyl Malonate for the Synthesis of Indolizine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective method for synthesizing multi&#8208;functionalized indolizine via tandem Knoevenagel&#8208;aldol cyclization, yielding a scaffold with a C6 hydroxy group and a C7 ethyl ester/aldehyde group under mild conditions with excellent efficiency.







Abstract
An effective method for the construction of a multi&#8208;functionalized pyridine motif of indolizine using the [4+2] annulation pathway involves tandem Knoevenagel&#8208;aldol cyclization as a critical step in the process. The production of an indolizine scaffold with a hydroxy group at the C6 position and an ethyl ester/aldehyde group at the C7 position was successfully accomplished using this approach with an excellent yield, with the use of a reagent that contains active methylene and operates under mild conditions. This straightforward and simple protocol allows extensions of the core moiety in a quick and dependable manner.

         <title>Characterization and Optimization of the Photoluminescent Properties of Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we have investigated the relationship between imidazole ring substitution in the R2&#8208;position and the blue photoluminescent properties of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines in more detail. For this purpose, a four&#8208;step synthesis was implemented and findings from previous work were extended upon. This allowed us to identify an advantageous substitution pattern to optimize the quantum yield in solution and in solid phase.







Abstract
In our previous work we could show, that Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines are compounds with interesting optical properties. In this work, we optimized the photoluminescent properties of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines by following outlined trends in our previous work. By introducing electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor residual groups on the imidazole ring, the quantum yield (QY) could be significantly increased. This indicated a clear advantageous substitution pattern for this system. In addition, cyclic voltammetric and UV/vis measurements in solid state lay the foundation for applications, such as organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold, in contrast to other transition metals, offers a unique reactivity profile and has emerged as an efficient tool in the field of synthetic organic chemistry. This review will focus on recent advances in gold&#8208;catalyzed Heck and Suzuki&#8208;type reactions, particularly those facilitated by photocatalysts and ligand design.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki and Heck reactions are two of the most common carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation reactions. Gold, unlike other transition metals (Pd, Ni, and Cu), offers unique reactivity profiles, and has emerged as an efficient tool in the field of synthetic organic chemistry. This mini&#8208;review focused on the recent work in gold&#8208;catalyzed Heck and Suzuki&#8208;type reactions, especially by photocatalysts or ligand design, which show reactivities and features distinct from other transition metals. These discoveries will further facilitate the development of gold redox catalysis as well as applications in organic synthesis, biochemistry, and medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Functionalized Phosphorus&#8208;Doped Porous Organic Polymers (FPPOPs) &#8208;Promoted Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Arylation of Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel porous organic polymers (POPs) that exhibited tunable and hyper&#8208;crosslinked, regular pore sizes and abundant micro/mesoporous structure, were prepared from co&#8208;polymerization of vinyl&#8208;substituted polyhedral oligomeric silsequioxane (POSS) and vinyl&#8208;substituted triphenylphosphine (ViPPh3), and it possessed excellent performance in the enhancement of chemoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation of hydrosilanes.







Abstract
The development of novel catalyst systems, especially as highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts for Si&#8722;C bond &#8208;forming arylation reaction of hydrosilanes is highly desirable. Herein, we developed a simple and eco&#8208;friendly methodology for construction of functionalized phosphorus&#8208;doped porous organic polymers (FPPOPs) and its heterogeneous palladium catalyst through anchoring on FPPOPs bearing a phosphine ligand, in which the fabrication of FPPOPs was completed through the vinyl&#8208;substituted triphenylphosphine (ViPPh3) and vinyl&#8208;substituted polyhedral oligomeric silsequioxane (ViPOSS) as well as functional olefins via radical co&#8208;polymerization. All these FPPOPs could act as a phosphine ligand for Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation of hydrosilanes have been characterized by SEM, FTIR, and X&#8208;RAD. Moreover, the POSS&#8208;based functionalized phosphorus&#8208;doped porous organic polymers (POSS&#8208;PPOPs) proved to be a high efficiency catalyst system for Si&#8722;C bond &#8208;forming arylation of hydrosilanes with aryl iodides and with good yields as well as excellent chemoselectivity with low amount of catalyst under mild conditions. The mechanistic studies supported the effect of functional group on the catalytic activity of Pd/FPPOPs catalyst, which revealed that the weak coordination as well as non&#8208;covalent interaction between porous organic polymers and substrate played important role in the enhancement of chemoselectivity.

&lt;p&gt;Novel porous organic polymers (POPs) that exhibited tunable and hyper-crosslinked, regular pore sizes and abundant micro/mesoporous structure, were prepared from co-polymerization of vinyl-substituted polyhedral oligomeric silsequioxane (POSS) and vinyl-substituted triphenylphosphine (ViPPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and it possessed excellent performance in the enhancement of chemoselective Pd-catalyzed arylation of hydrosilanes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of novel catalyst systems, especially as highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts for Si&#8722;C bond -forming arylation reaction of hydrosilanes is highly desirable. Herein, we developed a simple and eco-friendly methodology for construction of functionalized phosphorus-doped porous organic polymers (FPPOPs) and its heterogeneous palladium catalyst through anchoring on FPPOPs bearing a phosphine ligand, in which the fabrication of FPPOPs was completed through the vinyl-substituted triphenylphosphine (ViPPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and vinyl-substituted polyhedral oligomeric silsequioxane (ViPOSS) as well as functional olefins via radical co-polymerization. All these FPPOPs could act as a phosphine ligand for Pd-catalyzed arylation of hydrosilanes have been characterized by SEM, FTIR, and X-RAD. Moreover, the POSS-based functionalized phosphorus-doped porous organic polymers (POSS-PPOPs) proved to be a high efficiency catalyst system for Si&#8722;C bond -forming arylation of hydrosilanes with aryl iodides and with good yields as well as excellent chemoselectivity with low amount of catalyst under mild conditions. The mechanistic studies supported the effect of functional group on the catalytic activity of Pd/FPPOPs catalyst, which revealed that the weak coordination as well as non-covalent interaction between porous organic polymers and substrate played important role in the enhancement of chemoselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Mechanistic Study of the Oxidation of Substituted Benzyl Alcohols with Trichloroisocyanuric Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A systematic mechanistic study employing&#160;kobs&#160;kineticsmeasurements, linear free&#8208;energy relationship, hydrogen kinetic isotope effect and rate law, as well as the Density Functional Theory (DFT) approach (M06&#8208;2x/6&#8208;311G(d,p)) for the oxidation of diverse substituted benzyl alcohols with trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA) / H2O in 50 % MeCN / CH2Cl2&#160;at 25.0 &#176;C is present. The kinetic results showed an autocatalytic behavior and a primary kinetic isotope effect (4.22). The linear free&#8208;energy relationship (&#963;, &#961; = &#8208;1.22) indicated a mechanism change for 4&#8208;CF3, 3&#8208;NO2&#160;and 4&#8208;NO2&#160;substituted benzyl alcohols and a fractional rate law (3.25) for benzyl alcohol. The DFT results indicated Cl2, formed in situ from TCCA and the benzyl alcohol, as the actual oxidizing species. Furthermore, calculations support the kinetic results with high agreement through a transition state that performs a hydride abstraction by autocatalytic Cl2&#160;in the induction zone. In the case of substrates bearing strong electron withdrawing groups, the mechanism changes to hydrogen abstraction from the corresponding benzyl hypochlorite as the main pathway.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Abstract
A family of N,N&#180;&#8208;diaryl&#8208;N&#8243;&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)guanidines (B) were prepared in 70%&#8722;92% yields and subjected to palladium(0) catalyzed aminocarbonylation reactions with aryl iodides using CsOH/CHCl3 mixture as CO surrogate to afford the corresponding N&#8208;aroylguanidines (C) in 70%&#8722;93% yields. A gram scale synthesis was reported for a representative example. When the aforementioned reaction was carried out with 2&#8208;iodoaniline as an electrophile, either a mixture of two distinct 2&#8208;aminoquinazolinones (D and E) or one of these 2&#8208;aminoquinazolinones are formed. The scope of guanidines and aryl iodides were explored for both of the above&#8208;mentioned reactions. The role of directing group in the substrates upon the successful aminocarbonylation of guanidines, B is outlined. When the &#8208;C(O)Ar unit in N&#8208;aroylguanidines contain 2&#8208;aminophenyl unit, a spontaneous cyclisation occurs to afford D or E or a mixture of both. The reactions of a pair of N&#8208;aroylguanidines, C with PhI(OAc)2 afforded 2&#8208;aminobenzimidazoles, T with unanticipated core. Plausible mechanisms of formation of C, D, E and T are outlined.</dc:description>

A gram scale synthesis was reported for a representative example. When the aforementioned reaction was carried out with 2-iodoaniline as an electrophile, either a mixture of two distinct 2-aminoquinazolinones (D and E) or one of these 2-aminoquinazolinones are formed. The scope of guanidines and aryl iodides were explored for both of the above-mentioned reactions. The role of directing group in the substrates upon the successful aminocarbonylation of guanidines, B is outlined. When the -C(O)Ar unit in N-aroylguanidines contain 2-aminophenyl unit, a spontaneous cyclisation occurs to afford D or E or a mixture of both.

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Free Photochemical Atom Transfer Radical Addition of CBr4 onto Alkenes as a Key Step for Their Conversion to Propargylamines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green, efficient and metal&#8208;free photochemical protocol for the radical anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition of CBr4 onto various alkenes has been developed, using phenylglyoxylic acid as the photoinitiator, leading to the desired products in good to high yields with excellent regioselectivity. The conversion of the produced 1,1,1,3&#8208;tetrabromo derivatives to secondary or tertiary propargylamines in two steps has been demonstrated.







Abstract
&#913; green and sustainable metal&#8208;free photochemical protocol for the atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) of carbon tetrabromide onto alkenes was developed. Phenylglyoxylic acid was employed as the photoinitiator to promote the water&#8208;mediated anti&#8208;Markovnikov photochemical addition. A vast variety of alkenes was employed successfully, providing the corresponding products in good to high yields with excellent regioselectivity. The photochemical protocol found an application towards the three&#8208;step synthesis of secondary or tertiary propargylamines starting from alkenes.

         <title>Organocatalytic Applications of Sulfonyl Squaramides in Anion Recognition Strategies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A modular, 3&#8208;steps protocol for the synthesis of N&#8208;sulfonyl squaramides has been developed. The strategic installation of a tetrahedral, electron&#8208;withdrawing sulfonyl group into the squaramido core allowed the prevention of undesired self&#8208;aggregations, therefore upgrading the solubility in common organic solvents, and moreover, enhancing their H&#8208;bond donor abilities for molecular recognition. These unique features have been efficiently exploited in two different ion&#8208;pairing reactions: (i) the challenging C4&#8208;selective dearomatization of 2&#8208;picoline with silyl ketene acetals and (ii) the tritylation of Nmethylindole. Furthermore, their catalytic activities have been directly compared with other common and well&#8208;established (thio)urea analogues and related H&#8208;bond donors, revealing that highly acidic designs are essential to reach optimal catalytic performances.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroarylation of Organophosphonium Salts with Indoles in Water: Synthesis of Symmetrical and Unsymmetrical 3,3'&#8208;Bisindolylmethane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method for the synthesis of symmetrical and unsymmetrical 3,3'&#8208;bis(indolyl)methanes (3,3'&#8208;BIMs) has been developed through the direct heteroarylation of indolyl&#8208;containing di(hetero)aryl phosphonium salts with indole derivatives in aqueous media. This metal&#8208;free reaction proceeds smoothly under mild conditions, eliminating the need for hazardous solvents and expensive additives/catalysts typically used in conventional synthesis routes, thereby highlighting the synthetic practicality and efficiency of the process. The success of this approach is largely attributed to the role of water as a promoter, facilitating the C&#8208;P bond functionalization of the phosphonium salts. Furthermore, the reaction demonstrates a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and excellent scalability. Moreover, the protocol can also be extended to the synthesis of triindolylmethane compound and diarylmethylated indole.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of the cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;3&#8208;Fluoro Analogues of Febrifugine and Halofuginone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The novel synthesis of racemic cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;3&#8208;fluorofebrifugine and halofuginone is described. This straight&#8208;forward seven&#8208;step process relies on an electrophilic fluorination&#8208;allylation sequence&#160;generating&#160;a mixture of N&#8208;Cbz protected, diastereomeric 2&#8208;allyl&#8208;3&#8208;fluoropiperidines. On separation, a Wacker oxidation&#8208;methyl functionalisation sequence enabled introduction of the required quinazolinone portion. Finally, removal of the N&#8208;Cbz protecting group lead to isolation of the 3&#8208;fluorofebrifugine dihydrobromide analogues that are of potentially pharmacological use. Analysis of the NMR spectra for each stereoisomer provides information concerning the preferred conformers of the different diastereomers. Evidence indicates that the cis&#8208;diastereomer favours a conformation where the F&#8208;atom occupies an axial orientation. In contrast, for its trans&#8208;stereoisomeric counterpart, the 2&#8208;substituent overrides any F&#8208;atom effect and it preferentially occupies a conformer where both substituents occupy equatorial positions. Finally, interconversion between the cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;diastereomers was studied. In DMSO&#8208;d6 and as their free&#8208;bases, isomerisation of each diastereomer gave a common 65:35 ratio of trans&#8208; to cis&#8208;3&#8208;fluorofebrifugine. Determination of the reaction rate constants for the isomerisation process at different temperatures enabled calculation of the activation energy barriers, for each process, using an Arrhenius plot. The activation energy barrier for the isomerisation of the trans&#8208;isomer was 94.3&#160;kJ mol&#8208;1, whereas for the cis&#8208;isomer it was 84.5&#160;kJ mol&#8208;1</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Dinitroaromatics are valuable organic compounds. However, the high value of these compounds is accompanied by significant risks and formidable challenges. Herein, we report a safe and highly efficient method for the dinitration of various aromatic compounds, using KNO3 as nitrating agent, polyphosphoric acid as solvent and catalyst. This approach provides a safer and more efficient alternative to the traditional mixed acid system, making it suitable for a range of substrates, especially highly deactivated arenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Organoiodine Catalysed Intramolecular C&#8722;N bond Oxidative Coupling for the Synthesis of 3&#8208;Monosubstituted Oxindoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient organoiodine&#8208;catalysed intramolecular direct C&#8211;N bond oxidative coupling reaction is presented. Structurally diverse 3&#8208;(mono)substituted oxindoles were rapidly obtained in a complex oxidative system in up to 87% yield. Various N&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanamides were well&#8208;tolerated. This study showed that the electronic effects on the aromatic ring of reactants have a crucial effect on the selectivity (C&#8722;N/C&#8722;O) of cyclisation products. In addition, gram&#8208;scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage modification of 3&#8208;(mono)substituted oxindole derivatives revealed the practical application of this transformation.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a metal and additive&#8208;free unprecedented reactivity of &#946;&#8208;ketothioamides with sulfonyl chlorides for the synthesis of previously unreported 2&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;N,3&#8208;diarylpropanamides via in situ thioamide to amide conversion followed by dehydrohalogenative C&#8208;S cross&#8208;coupling at room temperature under an open air for the first time. The protocol demonstrates not only its operational simplicity, efficiency, mild condition, and scalability, but also easy to get the diverse &#945;&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoamides in good to high yields. Additionally, the DFT and photophysical studies supported the proposed mechanism, and revealed unique excitation&#8208;dependent emission coupled with ESPT for the synthesized sulfones.</dc:description>

Isocoumarins by Ring Transformation: The cyanide catalyzed ring transformation of an &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoester is the key transformation for the preparation of an optically active isocoumarin derivative.







Abstract
A four step sequence for the preparation of optically active (R,R)&#8208;ethyl 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroisocoumarin&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylate is reported. In the first step the first stereocenter was installed by palladium catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition of PhB(OH)2 to indenone (88&#8201;% ee). After deprotonation, the ester moiety was introduced with Mander's reagent. The &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of the resulting &#946;&#8208;oxoester was then achieved with cerium&#8208;catalysis under an air atmosphere. Key transformation was the cyanide&#8208;catalyzed ring transformation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoester furnishing the &#948;&#8208;lactone moiety of the target compound, which was formed as a mixture of separable cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;diastereoisomers, both with 88&#8201;% ee. The cis&#8208;isomer could be epimerized to the trans&#8208;compound. The relative trans and the absolute (R,R)&#8208;configuration of the target compound was established by X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analysis.

         <title>Adaptable Synthesis of Chondroitin Sulfate Disaccharide Subtypes Preprogrammed for Regiospecific O&#8208;Sulfation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A divergent synthetic route to chondroitin sulfate (CS) disaccharide precursors is presented herein. The route employs an orthogonal protecting group pattern and a post&#8208;glycosylation oxidation approach to access CS&#8722;A, CS&#8722;C, CS&#8722;D, CS&#8722;E and CS&#8722;O disaccharide precursors on gram scale. These materials will provide a benchmark to further synthesise and study chondroitin sulfates.







Abstract
A divergent synthetic route to chondroitin sulfate (CS) disaccharide precursors, including rarer subtypes such as CS&#8722;D, has been developed. From common intermediates, a series of thioglycoside D&#8208;glucosyl donors and 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;benzylidene protected D&#8208;galactosamine acceptors are utilised in a robust glycosylation reaction, achieving &#946;&#8208;selectivity and consistent yields (60&#8211;75&#8201;%) on scales &gt;2.0&#8197;g. A post&#8208;glycosylation oxidation to D&#8208;glucuronic acid and orthogonal protecting groups delivers access to CS&#8722;A, CS&#8722;C, CS&#8722;D, CS&#8722;E and CS&#8722;O precursor subtypes. Of further note is a 4&#8208;O&#8208;benzyl regioselective reductive ring opening of a 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;benzylidene protected disaccharide using dichlorophenylborane (PhBCl2) and triethylsilane (Et3SiH) to access a CS&#8722;D precursor, in 73&#8201;% yield over two steps. Finally, synthesis of a 6&#8208;O&#8208;sulfated CS&#8722;C disaccharide containing a conjugable anomeric allyl tether is completed. These materials will provide a benchmark to further synthesise and study chondroitin sulfates.

         <title>Recent Progress in the Photocatalytic Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Primary Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Tertiary primary amines (&#945;&#8208;TPAs) bearing a fully substituted carbon center adjacent to the N&#8208;unsubstituted amino group (&#8722;NH2) display unique biochemical activities. However, their facile synthesis remains a big challenge due to the sterically congested structure and strong nucleophilicity and alkalinity natures. Recently, the photoredox&#8208;catalyzed radical process provides a robust tool for various bond formations due to the high reactivity and less sensitive to steric hindrance of radical species. This review summarizes the recent progress in photocatalytic synthesis of &#945;&#8208;TPAs.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Tertiary primary amines (&#945;&#8208;TPAs) bearing a fully substituted carbon center adjacent to the N&#8208;unsubstituted amino group (&#8722;NH2) exhibit unique biochemical and physicochemical activities. While due to the sterically congested structure and strong nucleophilic and alkaline natures of these primary amine compounds, their facile synthesis remains an inherent challenge. Traditional methods commonly rely on tedious N&#8208;protection/deprotection operations and highly reactive organometallic reagents, thus leading to poor atom and step&#8208;economy and limited functional group compatibility. Modern photoredox catalysis offers a robust tool to prepare such structurally unique and synthetically valuable amine architectures via a radical pathway under extremely mild conditions. In this review, the recent progress in photocatalytic synthesis of &#945;&#8208;TPAs is systematically reviewed, and the reaction scope, limitations, and mechanisms for the reactions are discussed.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY) and tris(BODIPY) on 1,3,5&#8208;triazine scaffold were synthesized over a sequence of steps and our spectral and theoretical studies supported the presence of excitonic interactions between the fluorophores in tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY) whereas the tris(BODIPY) did not show such interactions.







Abstract
Tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY) on 1,3,5&#8208;triazine scaffold was synthesized over a sequence of steps starting from commercially available cyanuric chloride. The cyanuric chloride was reacted with p&#8208;hydroxy benzaldehyde to afford 1,3,5&#8208;triazine tris(p&#8208;oxybenzaldehyde) which was then reacted with excess pyrrole under acid catalyzed conditions to afford 1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;tris(meso&#8208;p&#8208;oxyphenyl dipyrromethane). Subsequent in&#8197;situ oxidation of this compound with DDQ to obtain tris(meso&#8208;oxyphenyldipyrromethene) which was then treated with pyrrole followed by the addition of Et3N/BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 afforded fluorescent tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY). For comparison, tris(BODIPY) on the triazine scaffold was prepared by oxidizing tris(meso&#8208;oxyphenyldipyrromethane) with DDQ followed by complexation with BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2. Both compounds were thoroughly characterized and studied by various experimental and theoretical methods. Absorption, steady state fluorescence, time&#8208;resolved fluorescence, and transient&#8208;absorption studies revealed that in tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY), excitonic interactions between two of the three 3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY units resulted in a hypsochromic shift in spectral bands, reducing the quantum yield and singlet state lifetime whereas tris(BODIPY) did not show such excitonic interactions. DFT studies helped in understanding the excitonic interactions in tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY). The tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY) was fluorescent both in solution and solid state. The viscosity studies indicated that the fluorescence of tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY) increases significantly with solvent viscosity, suggesting its potential for measuring cellular viscosity during physiological processes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tris(3-pyrrolyl BODIPY) on 1,3,5-triazine scaffold was synthesized over a sequence of steps starting from commercially available cyanuric chloride. The cyanuric chloride was reacted with p-hydroxy benzaldehyde to afford 1,3,5-triazine tris(p-oxybenzaldehyde) which was then reacted with excess pyrrole under acid catalyzed conditions to afford 1,3,5-triazine-tris(meso-p-oxyphenyl dipyrromethane). Subsequent in&#8197;situ oxidation of this compound with DDQ to obtain tris(meso-oxyphenyldipyrromethene) which was then treated with pyrrole followed by the addition of Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N/BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; afforded fluorescent tris(3-pyrrolyl BODIPY). For comparison, tris(BODIPY) on the triazine scaffold was prepared by oxidizing tris(meso-oxyphenyldipyrromethane) with DDQ followed by complexation with BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free, 4,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;iodobenzoic acid&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization strategy is developed for the synthesis of 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl benzothiazoles from aryl isothiocyanates and unfunctionalized arenes/thiophenes/furans at room temperature. The procedure entails a one&#8208;pot, cascade carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;sulfur bond formation facilitated by triflic acid, which serves as both a Bronsted acid and a ligand source at the in situ generated I(III) centre. This process is atom&#8208;economical and offers benefits over existing protocols for synthesizing benzothiazoles in terms of ease of use, eco&#8208;friendliness, and not requiring the typical use of aryl aldehyde/carboxylic acid precursors.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Semisaturated Fused Polycyclic Iminosugars by a Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: A series of semi&#8208;saturated fused polycyclic iminosugars were synthesized by one&#8208;pot stereoselective three&#8208;component reactions of D&#8208;ribose tosylate, aniline and cycloenones under heating conditions. The N&#8208;aryl enamine derived from an iminium ion is the key intermediate for the reaction. In this way, various novel complex fused iminosugars were obtained through a normal Diels&#8208;Alder mechanism at 80 &#176;C. This strategy will enable the preparation of bioactive iminosugar analogues with structural diversity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Reactions of 5,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazine N&#8208;oxides with enol diazoacetates were studied. A particular reaction path depends on the amount of catalyst and the order of the addition of the substrates. Use of Rh2(Oct)4 (2 mol.%) leads to chemoselective [3+3]&#8208;annulation producing 1,2&#8208;oxazine&#8208;fused 1,2&#8208;oxazine derivatives. With lower catalyst loadings (0.03 mol.%) enol diazoacetates are converted to cyclopropene derivatives, which in situ react with 1,2&#8208;oxazine N&#8208;oxides via tandem [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition&#8208;rearrangement producing oxazine&#8208;fused aziridines. Both transformations showed a wide substrate scope and produced target products with good yields and diastereoselectivity, thus allowing selective preparation of these rare heterocyclic systems. A mechanistic rationale for observed chemo&#8208; and stereo&#8208; selectivities was proposed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We summarized a strategy for C&#8211;H functionalization of cubanes, highlighting recent progress in the field. Cubane, known as a bioisostere of benzene ring, and its functionalization hold significant potential for future drug development. However, owing to its highly strained and thermodynamically unstable nature, the methodologies are limited and their precise and diverse functionalization is challenging in current organic chemistry. In this Concept, we categorized and explained these methodologies, which represents a majority of current cubane C&#8211;H functionalization. In addition, we discussed recent advancements in catalytic C&#8211;H functionalization methods, demonstrating their potential to address these challenges effectively.</dc:description>

         <title>A new CuI/oxalamide catalytic system for the large&#8208;scale aerobic oxidation of alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the report of oxamide ligands, they have been widely used for the efficient construction of various types of C&#8208;X (such as C, N, O and S) bonds. To evaluate whether the easily tunable electronic properties and unique coordination modes of oxamide ligands can also shine in the field of oxidation, we initiated a study on oxamide ligand/copper/air oxidation and applied it to the oxidation of alcohols to assess its practicality and potential applications. The practicality of this strategy was further verified through scale&#8208;up reactions on a 100 mmol scale and gram&#8208;scale derivatization of pharmaceutical molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium Supported on Silk Fibroin as Efficient Catalyst for Sonogashira Coupling and Sonogashira&#8208;Cacchi Type Annulation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium supported on silk fibroin (Pd/SF) has been successfully applied as catalyst in Sonogashira coupling and Sonogashira&#8208;Cacchi type annulation reactions, performed under air and copper&#8208;free conditions using very small metal loading (between 0.25 and 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%).







Abstract
A palladium catalyst supported on silk fibroin (Pd/SF) has been tested in the Sonogashira coupling reactions of a wide range of aryl iodides and terminal alkynes. The best catalytic performance was obtained at 90&#8201;&#176;C using only 0.25&#8197;mol&#8201;% metal loading under copper&#8208;free conditions, in the presence of a H2O/EtOH (3&#8201;:&#8201;2 v/v) solvent mixture and triethylamine as the base, affording the coupling products in good yields. The Pd/SF&#8208;based protocol was then successfully extended to the synthesis of benzofurans through Sonogashira&#8208;Cacchi type annulation of 2&#8208;iodophenol with terminal alkynes. Preliminary investigations on the recyclability and the heterogeneous behaviour of the catalyst were performed: hot filtration test and leaching test evidenced the presence of a small amount of soluble active palladium species into the reaction mixture. Nevertheless, Pd/SF could be reused in recharging test and it can be recycled in four consecutive runs with no significant deactivation.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Convergent, thiol&#8208; and metal&#8208;free strategy for the synthesis of benzothiazine&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives were developed from readily available precursors such as aryl ketone, aromatic amine and elemental sulfur. This reaction involves the formation of two new C&#8722;S bonds and one new C&#8722;N bond in single step employing environmentally benign iodine as the catalyst. Photophysical properties like quantum yield, solid&#8208;state emission, solvatochromism, Aggregation Induced Emission were also explored. Moreover, HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap was calculated for few compounds which suggests the possibility of Intramolecular charge transfer.







Abstract
A convergent synthesis of 2H&#8208;benzo[b][1,4]thiazin&#8208;2&#8208;one was achieved via iodine&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction. This strategy involves the formation of two new C&#8722;S bonds and a C&#8722;N bond from the readily available precursors &#8208; aryl methyl ketones, p&#8208;anisidine, and elemental sulfur to generate the desired heterocycle in moderate to good yields. As the synthesized benzothiazine&#8208;2&#8208;ones are fluorescent under UV light, photophysical properties like solid&#8208;state emission, solvatochromism, Aggregation Induced Emission (AIE), and the relative quantum yields of the compounds were measured which proves them to be a potential candidate for the development of optoelectronic devices.

         <title>A Supramolecular Gel that Exhibits Multi&#8208;stimuli Responsiveness and High Conductivity Through Host&#8208;Guest Interactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A network&#8208;structured supramolecular gel is constructed through host&#8208;guest interactions between conjugated ligands and metal ions, leading to enhanced mechanical properties and excellent electrical conductivity. This overcomes the problem of insufficient conductance due to the presence of solvent in the interstitial region of the supramolecular gel. Supramolecular gels can undergo reversible sol&#8208;gel transitions by controlling the pH or temperature of the system. In addition, a method has been developed to determine the specific binding ratio of host&#8208;guest molecules by conductivity tests, and has been used to verify the specific binding ratio of crown ether to potassium ions. To explain the high conductivity of supramolecular metallic gels, DFT and SEM have been employed to elucidate their conductivity mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Oligonucleotides Containing 8,1&#8242;&#8208;Ethano&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine: Synthesis and Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article presents the synthesis and properties of oligonucleotides containing 8,1&#8242;&#8208;ethano&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (ethano&#8208;dA) in which the adenine base (ethA) is fixed to the syn conformation. Ethano&#8208;dA phosphoramidite was synthesized by using a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer/radical cyclization process and introduced into oligonucleotides, which were successfully obtained by employing the 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxytrityl&#8208;off synthesis mode. The duplex&#8208;forming ability of the oligonucleotides containing ethano&#8208;dA was evaluated. In the antiparallel Watson&#8211;Crick duplex, the ethA formed stable base pairs with thymine and guanine, in which two Hoogsteen&#8208;type hydrogen bonds could be formed. By contrast, the parallel Hoogsteen duplex containing the ethA:thymine base pair showed thermal stability comparable to that containing a natural adenine:thymine base pair because ethA and thymine can form two Watson&#8211;Crick&#8208;type hydrogen bonds. These results indicated that ethano&#8208;dA may be helpful for elucidating the function of adenine bases via the syn conformation in DNA.</dc:description>

Abstract
An efficient I2&#8208;promoted Povarov multicomponent reaction for the synthesis of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biquinolines or N&#8208;heteroaromatic benzothiazole using 2&#8208;methylquinoline or 2&#8208;methylbenzo[d]thiazole, arylamines, and &#945;&#8208;ketoesters was developed. The methyl group of methyl aza&#8208;arenes incorporated in the Povarov reaction via an iodination/Kornblum oxidation sequence. This method was achieved through a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step process without the need for transition metals, demonstrating excellent scalability in synthesis.

         <dc:description>
An unprecedented palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade carbonylation/Heck reaction/esterification is demonstrated for the efficient construction of benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one&#8208;containing &#947;&#8208;ketoesters in an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical manner.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylated Alkyl Electrophiles and Allylic Sulfones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated motifs are commonly found in drugs and agrochemicals. The inclusion of fluorine&#8208;containing motifs in drug candidates during lead optimization has become a valuable strategy in pharmaceutical research and development. Significant research efforts have been dedicated to synthesizing molecules with a trifluoromethyl (CF3&#8722;) group on a stereogenic carbon. Herein, we disclose a mild and efficient nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling between &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkyl bromides and allylic sulfones, enabling the efficient synthesis of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl homoallylic alkanes. This reaction featuring base&#8208;free, mild conditions, a broad substrate scope, and high functional group tolerance. The synthetic versatility of this approach is further underscored by its successful application in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of a range of drug molecules. Our preliminary mechanistic study suggests that this allylation process operates through a radical intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Chromium in Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis: Unique Reactivity, Mechanisms and Future Directions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible&#8208;light photocatalysis has emerged as a prominent research area in modern organic synthesis and environmental science. As an important transition metal, chromium has garnered widespread attention in the field of visible&#8208;light photocatalysis in recent years, primarily manifested in the following aspects: a) the unique photochemical properties of chromium(III) complexes endow them with longer excited&#8208;state lifetimes and higher reactivities; b) by harnessing visible light to induce single&#8208;electron transfer or hydrogen atom transfer to generate radicals, which subsequently form alkyl&#8208;chromium(III) intermediates with chromium(II) ligands, these intermediates can selectively attack electron&#8208;deficient carbonyl compounds, enabling the construction of target products; c) following metals like cerium, copper, iron, nickel, cobalt, titanium, and bismuth, the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) reaction pathways in chromium photocatalysis have also been extensively investigated.This review will provide a comprehensive summary of recent research on chromium&#8208;mediated photocatalytic reactions, offering an in&#8208;depth exploration of their unique reactivity, mechanisms, and future directions.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Hydroboration of Ketones and Imines Using Amidophosphine&#8208;borane under Catalyst&#8208;Free Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here the use of amidophosphine borane {(BH&#8323;)&#8322;(PPh)&#8322;N(CH&#8322;)C&#8326;H&#8325;} as a competent reducing agent for the hydroboration of ketones and imines, yielding the corresponding&#160;secondary alcohols and secondary amines&#160;under mild and catalyst&#8208;free reaction conditions. Solid amidophosphine boranes, which are easy to synthesize, and easy to handle demonstrated excellent reactivity and functional group tolerance toward a wide variety of ketones and imines, including aromatic, heteroaromatic, and aliphatic derivatives with electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating substitutions, thus showing excellent chemoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of sulfoCy5&#8208; and sulfoCy7&#8208;&#945;GalCer Probes as Chemical Tools for Investigating the Uptake of Liposomal &#945;GalCer Conjugates by Antigen Presenting Cells</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Galactosylceramide (&#945;GalCer) is a synthetic glycolipid that, when loaded into the CD1d receptor of antigen presenting cells, activates iNKT cells to coordinate the generation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. In vaccines, the &#945;GalCer adjuvant is generally delivered in liposomes, but interestingly, little is known about the intracellular fate of &#945;GalCer&#8211;antigen conjugates resulting in the absence of clear &#8220;design rules&#8221; for this type of compounds and their formulations. To unravel the uptake mechanism of liposomal &#945;GalCer conjugates and understand the fate of its components, we synthesized sulfoCy7&#8211;&#945;GalCer 1 and sulfoCy5&#8211;&#945;GalCer 2. The fluorescent probes were obtained from a linker&#8211;functionalized &#945;GalCer, which was then modified with sulfoCy7/sulfoCy5. After formulation in liposomes, the cellular presentation was studied in a murine dendritic cell line using fluorescence imaging and flow cytometry. Imaging indicates that liposomes loaded with sulfoCy5&#8211;&#945;GalCer are taken up by DC2.4 cells in a heterogeneous and concentration&#8208;dependent manner. Additionally, fluorescence antibody staining confirms that &#945;GalCer is ultimately presented by CD1d receptors, but importantly is cleaved from sulfoCy5 before reaching the cell surface. These results validate our synthetic probes as useful in mechanistic studies of the uptake of &#945;GalCer&#8211;antigen conjugates as shown here for DC2.4 cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd/Cu Dual Catalysis for the Oxidative Dearomatization of PyrroleDerivatives: Mechanistic Insights and Biological Studies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have reported an oxidative dearoamatization of pyrrole derivatives to give a highly functionalized isoindolinone derivatives. Synthesized products have been analyzed for their non&#8208;cytotoxic behavior and two of them have been utilized for their antipromastigotic activity against L. Donovanai. In addition to that the mechanism has also been explored using DFT calculations.







Abstract
Herein we report dearomatization of pyrrole ring followed by rearomatization of cyclohexyl ring to obtain isoindolinone scaffold by a Pd/Cu dual catalysis approach in an atom economic way with moderate to high yield. The expected Pd/Cu catalyzed dual C(sp2)&#8208;H activation via normal catalytic cycle can be override by unusual oxidative dearomatization reaction which has been established by DFT calculation. The biological importance of isoindolinone scaffold insists us to successfully investigate in&#8197;vitro antileishmanial activity of L.Donovani.

         <title>Molecular Break Junction: A Stage for Redox Transformations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An exceptionally brilliant strategy to miniaturize electronic devices is to employ a single&#8208;molecule between two electrodes for carrier conduction at single&#8208;molecule break junctions (SMBJ). To understand the intrinsic mechanisms of operation at these junctions, extremely crucial is to study physical, chemical, and electrochemical properties employing single&#8208;molecules at SMBJs. Further, redox&#8208;based transformations at the nano&#8208;junction could be achieved electrochemically to allow efficient switching between different redox states of a single&#8208;molecule, showcasing the possibility of maneuvering transport properties with on&#8208;off states of the molecule. Herein, are presented the fundamentals of SMBJs, and the electrochemically influenced transformations or switching of organic molecules pursued at SMBJs. Such an understanding of electrochemical phenomena at the nanoscale dimension could bridge the knowledge gap between macroscopic electronic circuits and single&#8208;molecule electronic circuits, whereby the feasibility of switching between the states could maneuver the electronic properties as well as other photophysical parameters.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium Catalyzed Formation of Fused Pyridine Derivatives or Substituted Indoles from Hydrazine&#8208;Derived Enamines and Propargyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed transformations of secondary propargyl alcohols with hydrazine&#8208;derived enamines are presented, affording fused pyridines or substituted indoles depending on the hydrazine derivative used. The cascade reactions are catalyzed by an air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable bifunctional ruthenium complex and proceed via redox&#8208;isomerization of the propargyl alcohol, subsequent Michael addition and cyclocondensation. In case of phenylhydrazine a Fischer&#8208;indole synthesis also takes place, prior to the final release of the products.

The cascade reactions are catalyzed by an air- and moisture-stable bifunctional ruthenium complex and proceed via redox-isomerization of the propargyl alcohol, subsequent Michael addition and cyclocondensation. In case of phenylhydrazine a Fischer-indole synthesis also takes place, prior to the final release of the products. The produced heterocyclic motifs are important scaffolds in medicinal and agricultural chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Conversion Of N&#8208;Troponyl&#8208;Amino Acid Derivatives Into Cationic Troponyl&#8208;Oxazolidines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzoxazole and benzoxazolidine are constituents of various bioactive natural/synthetic molecules comprising benzenoid aromatic residue. However, non&#8208;benzenoid aromatic scaffolds such as tropone and tropolone are also found in natural products. This report describes the synthesis of unusual cationic troponyl&#8208;oxazolidine derivatives from N&#8208;troponyl&#8208;amino acids/peptides by Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed transformation. X&#8208;ray studies confirm the formation of the first tropylium cation annelated oxazolidine structures and support the formation of unique supramolecular self&#8208;assembly structures owing to the H&#8208;bonding. The CV studies of new tropylium cations reveal their reduction potential ca &#8208;1.2 V. Hence, cationic troponyl&#8208;oxazolidinyl amino acids/peptides could be promising analogs of benzoxazolidine for the development of therapeutic drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Roles of Divinylbenzene Co&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linker in &#160;a&#160;Threefold Cross&#8208;Linked Polystyrene&#8208;Phosphine Hybrid Monolith: Impact of Cross&#8208;Linking Degree on Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Continuous&#8208;flow organic transformations using immobilized catalysts are crucial for green and sustainable chemistry. Cross&#8208;linked polymer ligands offer high stability, ease of recovery through filtration, and thus enhance performance in continuous&#8208;flow reactions via transition&#8208;metal catalysis. Additionally, the cross&#8208;linking structure of the polymer support creates a unique reaction platform that controls the coordination behavior of the supported ligands and stabilizes the metal catalysts. However, insights into the material&#8208;based design for preparing highly active and durable immobilized metal catalysts are still limited. In this report, we propose a straightforward approach to boost both selective mono&#8208;coordination and effective stabilization of metal complexes. We developed threefold cross&#8208;linked polystyrene&#8208;triphenylphosphine hybrid monoliths with cross&#8208;linking structures adjusted by varying the content of divinylbenzene as co&#8208;cross&#8208;linker. The coordination behaviors and metal&#8208;support interactions of these monoliths were evaluated, highlighting the importance of co&#8208;cross&#8208;linker content in site&#8208;isolating phosphine units and stabilizing metal centers via arene&#8208;metal interactions on the polystyrene network. By optimizing the cross&#8208;linking structure, the monolith catalysts demonstrated exceptionally high catalytic activity and durability in Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;Cl transformations, such as Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings and Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig aminations in continuous flow. This underscores the utility of our monolith system in challenging transition&#8208;metal catalysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A novel series of aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluorocyclopropyl 1 and &#945;,&#946;,&#946;&#8208;trifluorocyclopropyl 2&#946;&#8208;lactams have been prepared and their activity explored across various Mycobacteria and also the ESKAPE panel of pathogens. The most active of these compounds 1a displayed good activity against clinically challenging Mycobacteria such as M. bovis BCG (MIC 0.39 mg/mL)) and did not show any significant activity against the ESKAPE pathogens indicating selectivity for this otherwise challenging class of pathogen. Compound 1a was however rapidly metabolised and toxic to a human model cell line (HepG2) limiting its clinical development at this stage. The compounds were designed to exploit a fluoride ion elimination mechanism concomitant with &#946;&#8208;lactam ring opening, as the basis of a mechanism induced trigger to generate a reactive intermediate (suicide inhibition). In model alkoxide reactions a representative from both classes 1 and 2 resulted in &#946;&#8208;lactam ring opening but only the more active mono&#8208;fluoro cyclopropane series 1 triggered fluoride ion elimination after ring opening and this may form the basis of its activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Organocatalysis: Simple Chiral Primary Diamine&#8208;TfOH&#8208;catalysed Asymmetric Aldol and Robinson Annulation Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemical organocatalysis, which integrates mechanochemistry and organocatalysis to provide a metal&#8208;and solvent&#8208;free synthetic method for synthesizing chiral products, has garnered significant interest recently due to its importance in green chemistry. In this study, simple, unmodified commercially available chiral primary diamines with TfOH were employed as catalysts in mechanochemical direct asymmetric aldol and Robinson annulation reactions. This protocol demonstrated high efficiency, atom economy and high stereoselectivity. Notably, direct asymmetric aldol reactions involving unreactive aromatic methyl ketones, which still is a challenge for mechanochemical organocatalysis, proceeded smoothly. Additionally, the first mechanochemical asymmetric Robinson annulation reaction was reported and chiral 3,5&#8208;diaryl&#8208;cyclohexenones were efficiently synthesized using this method. These findings highlight the potential of mechanochemical organocatalysis for asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient hydrogenation of organic compounds employing low&#8208;cost and easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize catalysts is highly desirable as the corresponding hydrogenated products have significant importance in pharmaceutical and fine&#8208;chemical industries. Herein, a cobalt(II) complex supported by &#945;&#8208;diimine ligand has been easily prepared by treatment of anhydrous CoCl2 with diimine, which can catalyze the hydrogenation of unsaturated bond with ammonia borane as the hydrogen source. A variety of ketones and aldimines bearing diverse functional groups can be reduced to corresponding alcohols and amines in moderate to excellent yields at ambient conditions. It is noteworthy that several readily reducible functional groups such as nitro and cyano are tolerated under the standard reaction conditions. Furthermore, the gram&#8208;scale reaction has been successfully carried out and the procedure could be handled easily, which both make this methodology general and practical.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed &#947;&#8208;alkenylation of unactivated alkenes with vinylcyclopropanes assisted by a strong coordinating 8&#8208;aminoquinoline directing group has been demonstrated. The protocol exhibits good substrate scope and selectivity. Substrate diversification and mechanistic investigations were carried out for the reaction. A plausible mechanism was also proposed based on the mechanistic investigation performed.







Abstract
Herein, we have demonstrated a palladium&#8208;catalyzed &#947;&#8208;alkenylation of unactivated alkenes with vinylcyclopropanes. A bidentate 8&#8208;aminoquinoline directing group was utilized for the regioselective &#947;&#8208;C(alkenyl)&#8722;H functionalization of unactivated alkenes with vinylcyclopropanes. This protocol exhibits wide substrate scope and good selectivity. Additionally, substrate diversification was performed to demonstrate the synthetic utility of the protocol. Mechanistic investigations were carried out to provide an insight to the reaction mechanism. A plausible mechanism was also proposed for the present methodology.

         <title>Continuous Flow Spirocyclization Reactions: Towards Efficient Synthesis of Chiral Spiropenicillanates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe the development of a continuous flow approach to chiral spiropenicillanates with remarkable bioactive properties from 6&#8208;alkylidenepenicillanates via phosphine&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of allenoates or via 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition with diphenyldiazomethane.
Model reactions were carried out using simple alkenes, such as methyl vinyl ketone and&#160;N&#8208;substituted maleimides, leading to the corresponding products in excellent yields (up to 96%). The [3+2] annulation reaction was subsequently extended to the reactivity of 6&#8208;alkylidenepenicillanates, a more complex 2&#960;&#8208;component with an exocyclic carbon&#8208;carbon double bond, allowing the synthesis of spirocyclic compounds. Two regioisomeric chiral spirocyclopentene&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams were obtained, in moderate to good overall yields (31&#8208;84%). The 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions between 6&#8208;alkylidenepenicillanates and diphenyldiazomethane under continuous flow conditions&#160;gave the corresponding spiro&#8208;1&#8208;pyrazolinepenicillanates in high yields (up to 81%).&#160;Thermal ring contraction, via N2&#160;extrusion, of spiro&#8208;1&#8208;pyrazolinepenicillanates under continuous&#160;flow conditions led&#160;to spirocyclopropanepenicillanates in quantitative yields.&#160;
The continuous flow proved to be an efficient methodology for the synthesis of&#160;spiropenicillanates and represents&#160;a more sustainable approach for the scale&#8208;up synthesis of spiropenicillanates with relevant biological activity.</dc:description>

         <title>[4+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition Reactions to Corannulene Accelerated by &#951;6&#8208;Coordination of Ruthenium Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination of Ru complexes to corannulene increases substantially its reactivity as a dienophile in Diels&#8208;Alder reactions because of the Pauli repulsion&#8208;lowering effect. Lowering of the repulsive Pauli repulsion term is driven by the charge transfer from the corannulene to the metal moiety.







Abstract
The influence of different (LRu)nII (L=Cp&#8211; (n=1, 2); C6H6) moieties &#951;6&#8208;coordinated to corannulene ((CpRu)+, (Benzene)Ru2+ and (CpRu)22+) has been explored by using the Activation Strain Model (ASM) of reactivity together with the Energy Decomposition Analysis (EDA) scheme. The results obtained have been compared with those obtained for the non&#8208;coordinated corannulene counterpart. It has been observed that the presence of the ruthenium moiety favors both kinetically and thermodynamically the [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction with cyclopentadiene. The factors governing these differences depend on the nature of the [Ru] complex. Whereas the interaction energy is solely responsible for the lower activation energy for the monocationic system (CpRu)+, not only the higher interaction but also the lower strain energy explain the much higher reactivity observed for the dicationic systems ((C6H6)Ru2+ and (CpRu)22+). In this latter case, the Pauli repulsion energy term is the factor controlling the differences in the interaction energies, following the so&#8208;called Pauli repulsion&#8208;lowering concept. Finally, when &#951;6&#8208;coordinating mono&#8208; or dicationic ruthenium complexes, although the [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction in the external rim bonds remains the thermodynamically and kinetically more favourable, the cycloaddition becomes also thermodynamically feasible in some internal bonds.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and convenient method is developed for the synthesis of 2&#8208;quinolinones from o&#8208;iodoanilines with acrylates or acrylic acids. The key to achieve the cyclization reaction is to utilize redox&#8208;neutral base. The reaction mechanism involving a Heck coupling intermediate is well investigated.







Abstract
A convenient and general method for the construction of 2&#8208;quinolinones was developed in this paper. The Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction of various o&#8208;iodoanilines with acrylates or acrylic acids proceeded smoothly to produce 2&#8208;quinolinones in 28&#8211;&gt;99&#8201;% yields. The key to achieve the cyclization reaction is to utilize suitable base, such as potassium pivalate and potassium acetate. Various synthetically useful functional groups, such as halogen atoms, methoxycarbonyl, and nitro groups, remained intact during the reaction. The effects of catalyst and base on this cyclization reaction and kinetic experiments were investigated to understand the aspect of the reaction.

         <title>Synthesis of Natural Product&#8208;like Indeno[2,1&#8208;b]indole/Shikimic Acid Hybrid Analogues with Anti&#8208;osteoclastogenic Activity via Photo&#8208;Nazarov Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indeno[2,1&#8208;b]indole and shikimic acid&#8208;like structures are natural privileged scaffolds in several bioactive NPs. In this work, we developed a high&#8208;efficient and diastereoselective synthetic approach to the construction of novel indeno[2,1&#8208;b]indole/shikimic acid hybrid analogues via photo&#8208;Nazarov reaction.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Indeno[2,1-b]indole and shikimic acid-like structures are natural privileged scaffolds in several bioactive NPs. In this work, we developed a high-efficient and diastereoselective synthetic approach to the construction of novel indeno[2,1-b]indole/shikimic acid hybrid analogues via photo-Nazarov reaction. The protocol is the first case of excited-state photo-Nazarov cyclization of indole-2-yl vinyl ketone to indeno[2,1-b]indole. And the yield of (6aS, 10aR)-product was up to 91% after the condition optimization. Even more attractive, several synthesized analogues exhibit potent RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis inhibitory activities, which suggests promising prospect of the novel indeno[2,1-b]indole/shikimic acid hybrid scaffold for anti-osteoporosis drug development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Formal General Method for the Synthesis of Spiroacetals: Easy Access to Oleocaran/Elmonin Core</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five [n,n]&#8208; and [m,n]&#8208;spiroacetals with five, six and seven membered rings were prepared by using a formal method from cheap starting materials and reagents and applying simple procedures. This method was further adapted for the synthesis of a more complex spiroacetal, namely the spiro[isobenzofuran&#8208;1,20&#8208;naphtho[1,8b,c]furan] skeleton of the enantiomeric couple oleocaran and elmonin, as an example demonstrating its potential.







Abstract
A general method for the synthesis of spiroacetals was investigated. Simple symmetrical [n,n]&#8208;spiroacetals (n=5,6) can be prepared from &#945;,&#969;&#8208;alkanediols by their conversion to the respective &#969;&#8208;benzyloxyalkyl bromides, addition of their Grignard reagents to ethyl formate, further oxidation of the resulting secondary alcohols and finally deprotection with spontaneous intramolecular acetalization. Access to the respective unsymmetrical [m,n]&#8208;spiroacetals (m,n=5,6,7) was similarly achieved by addition of the above Grignard reagent to a &#969;&#8208;benzyloxyalkanal, followed by the same reaction sequence. This method was further adapted for the synthesis of the unsubstituted structural core of natural spiroacetals oleocaran and elmonin, thus demonstrating its potential.

         <title>Catalytic Activity of Mono&#8208;and Bimetallic Rhodium(I) and Iridium(I) Complexes Bearing Carbon&#8208;Ether&#8208;Carbon (COC) Ligand for the Intramolecular Cyclization of 4&#8208;Pentynoic Acid</title>

         <dc:description>
The catalytic activity of a set of mono&#8208; and bimetallic Rh(I) and Ir(I) complexes featuring carbene&#8208;linker&#8208;carbene (COC) bis&#8208;triazolylidene ligands coordinated in a bridging or chelating fashion was assessed in the cyclization of 4&#8208;pentynoic acid.







Abstract
The catalytic performance of a series of mono&#8208; and bimetallic Ir(I) and Rh(I) complexes bearing the (COC) bis&#8208;triazolylidene ligand, coordinated in a bridging or chelating fashion, was evaluated in the cyclization of 4&#8208;pentynoic acid. The chelated mononuclear cationic complex [Ir(cod)(COC)]PF6 (cod=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene; COC=biscarbene ether) displayed the highest reaction rate for 4&#8208;pentynoic acid to form &#947;&#8208;methyl&#8208;ene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone (5&#8208;methylenedihydrofuran&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;one). Density Functional Theory calculations were carried out to rationalize the reaction mechanism which proceeds in three steps, namely coordination of the alkyne to the active catalyst followed by intramolecular cyclization and final reductive elimination. Its catalytic performance was further assessed against different substituted 4&#8208;pentynoic acid derivatives.

         <title>Saturated Heterocyclic Sulfamoyl Fluorides: Building Blocks for the SuFEx Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable and cost&#8208;effective procedure for the direct fluorosulfonylation of saturated (hetero)cyclic and functionalized amines using SO2F2 in basic media is reported. The obtained sp3&#8208;enriched sulfamoyl fluorides can be considered a new generation of building blocks for SuFEx chemistry: they participated in transformations tolerating the SO2F functionality and reactions at the sulfur atom with O&#8208;, N&#8208;, and C&#8208;nucleophiles.







Abstract
A scalable protocol for direct SO2F2&#8208;based fluorosulfonylation of saturated (hetero)cyclic and functionalized amines is reported. The method is cost&#8208;effective and applicable for multigram preparation of structurally diverse compounds, as illustrated by the synthesis of 58 building blocks decorated with common functional groups. A comparison of overall yields of products demonstrates the advantages of the present method over alternative approaches. The obtained functionalized sp3&#8208;enriched sulfamoyl fluorides can be considered a new generation of building blocks for SuFEx (sulfur fluoride exchange) chemistry. The synthetic utility of the synthesized building blocks was demonstrated by late&#8208;stage reactions tolerating the SO2F functionality as well as transformations to provide the corresponding sulfamide, sulfamate, and sulfonamide derivatives.

         <title>Expanding 1&#8208;Aminosugar Synthesis through Activated Glycals&#8217; Reactivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and efficient protocol for the synthesis of 1&#8208;aminosugars under mild reaction conditions has been developed. This method utilizes activated glycals as substrates and successfully achieves the Ferrier&#8208;type reaction in the presence of various alkyl amines to lead to 1&#8208;aminoglycosides in good yields and good to excellent &#946;&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
Glycal family offers an interesting platform whose reactivity let the possibility to reach diverse glycoanalogues. In particular, the Ferrier rearrangement allows the introduction of diverse nucleophiles on the anomeric position but stays limited with regard to the nitrogen&#8208;containing nucleophiles, which can be possibly used with success. Herein, we utilize peracetylated C2&#8208;substituted glycal substrates to achieve Ferrier&#8208;type 1&#8208;aminoglycoside compounds under activator&#8208;free conditions, resulting in moderate to good yields and good to excellent &#946;&#8208;selectivity. Various secondary amines have been successfully employed. We explored the influence of C2&#8208;substitution (electron&#8208;withdrawing character) and glycal configuration, synthesizing 20 different 1&#8208;aminoglycosides through this method.

         <title>Improving Zonisamide Manufacturing: Insights into Stereochemistry and Mechanisms for Continuous Optimization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zonisamide, an important anti&#8208;epileptic drug, was prepared with a new and convenient synthesis. This process involves the preparation of a key hydroxyiminosultone intermediate, whose stereochemistry was characterized by powder XRD, and a rearrangement reaction, whose mechanism was investigated with a combination of techniques (NMR, HRMS and kinetic profiles).







Abstract
Zonisamide is a heterocyclic sulfonamide widely employed as anticonvulsant. In this work, we report an efficient process for the preparation of zonisamide, obtained in a six&#8208;step synthesis from phenyl salicylate with an overall 31&#8201;% yield. The key step is represented by a base&#8208;promoted intramolecular rearrangement of a &#946;&#8208;ketosultone oxime, leading to the concomitant formation of the benzisoxazole ring and of the exocyclic sulfonic group. This intriguing transformation is investigated with a combination of analytical techniques (NMR, HRMS, PXRD), leading to a preliminary mechanistic proposal.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Helicenes from Centrally Chiral Precursors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a systematic overview of the asymmetric synthesis of helicenes from centrally chiral precursors via central&#8208;to&#8208;helical chiral conversion or transfer strategies. It covers a broad spectrum of reactions, including Fischer indolization, Povarov reaction, Michael reaction, [3+2] and [2+2+2] cycloadditions, showcasing the versatility of these approaches in constructing enantioenriched helicenes.







Abstract
Chiral helicenes are widely used in fields related to organic materials and molecular machines relevant molecules, as well as serving as privileged frameworks for chiral ligands and catalysts. Therefore, the research into asymmetric routes for the synthesis of chiral helical compounds has garnered significant interest in recent years. In this regard, chirality conversion/transfer from chiral precursors has emerged as a powerful strategy for the construction of chiral helicenes, allowing the synthesis of various types of chiral helical compounds. This strategy has become and will remain a prominent research topic in the field of asymmetric synthesis. In this review article, described between 2012 and 2024, the approaches for the synthesis of chiral helicenes by chirality conversion or transfer from centrally chiral precursors are summarized.

         <title>Synthesis of Enamides through Hydro&#8208;Functionalization of Ynamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of functionalized enamides as versatile synthetic intermediates reflects the constant strive and creativity in the design and execution of synthetic methods and contemporary interest in the exploration of ynamide chemistry. In this review, important developments in the hydrofunctionalization of ynamides toward the formation of functionalized enamides have been highlighted.







Abstract
Most of the methods for the synthesis of functionalized enamides from ynamides were developed in the last two decades showing the contemporary interest in the exploration of ynamide chemistry. The utilization of the intrinsic reactivity of the ynamide triple bond through keteniminium intermediacy, coordination with metals, and as a radical acceptor toward the development of strategies for the synthesis of functionalized enamides reflect the constant strive and creativity in the design and execution of synthetic methods. The present review summarizes the synthetic strategies developed during the last two decades and is divided into the sections depending on the type of hydrofunctionalization reaction. It may be predicted that this field of chemistry will continue to grow exponentially in the coming years and the ready availability of a wide range of ynamides now provides an excellent opportunity to further enrich mainstream synthetic methodologies.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrogenative Coupling of Aryldiazonium Salts with Terminal Alkynes for the Assembly of Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An eco&#8208;friendly NHC&#8208;palladium&#8208;catalyzed denitrogenative coupling of aryldiazonium salts with terminal alkynes in basic ionic liquid for the assembly of structurally diverse internal alkynes is accomplished. The basic ionic liquid [C3NH2mim]Br is crucial for this catalytic transformation. In the presence of 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of IMes&#8208;Pd&#8208;Im&#8208;Cl2 in [C3NH2mim]Br, both the terminal alkynes and aryldiazonium salt were well tolerated, thus giving the desired internal alkynes in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
An N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene palladium (NHC&#8208;palladium)&#8208;catalyzed denitrogenative coupling of aryldiazonium salts with terminal alkynes in ionic liquids has been accomplished. This catalytic strategy provides an effective and green synthetic protocol for the assembly of structurally diverse internal alkynes with excellent functional group compatibility and mild conditions. In the presence of 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of IMes&#8208;Pd&#8208;Im&#8208;Cl2 as the catalyst, a wide range of terminal alkynes and aryldiazonium salts could be excellently tolerated. Basic ionic liquid plays a crucial role in this catalytic system, which not only acts as the green solvent, but also provides basic environment for the carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation process. Notably, this catalytic system could be recycled up to six times and reused without significant loss of catalytic activity.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Seven&#8208;Membered Lactams: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioenriched seven&#8208;membered lactams represent an important structural motif and present in a wide range of biologically active compounds and drugs. Significant progress has been achieved in this domain more recently. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral seven&#8208;membered lactams.







Abstract
The optically active lactams represent an important structural motif and present in a wide range of natural products, biologically active compounds and drugs. Compared to the synthesis of chiral five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered lactams, the asymmetric construction of seven&#8208;membered lactams often presents a challenge due to their consequential entropic and enthalpic barriers. Over the past few decades, substantial efforts have been devoted to this field and chemists have developed various efficient strategies for the preparation of seven&#8208;membered lactams. In this review, we will highlight the recent advances in enantioselective formation of seven&#8208;membered lactams and the discussion will be logically divided into three parts according to the reaction mode. The aim of this review is to familiarize the Reader with new synthetic opportunities offered by these interesting methodologies.

Abstract
A diaminomethylenemalononitrile organocatalyst efficiently promoted asymmetric cascade Michael/Michael reactions between a 2&#8208;(trifluoromethylmethylene)indane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione derivative and &#945;&#8208;alkylidene succinimides, resulting in spiroindane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione derivatives. These derivatives feature four consecutive carbon stereocenters, including one stereocenter with a trifluoromethyl substituent, and were formed in high yield with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 94&#8201;% ee). This study marks the first successful example of using methyleneindane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione derivatives, bearing alkoxycarbonyl and trifluoromethyl groups at the &#946;&#8208;position, as Michael acceptors.

         <title>Base&#8208;Promoted Regioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Amino BODIPYs through Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling with Anilines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of &#945;&#8208;amino BODIPYs were synthesized through a base&#8208;promoted oxidative cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling with air as a green oxidant. Furthermore, these newly synthesized BODIPYs showed potential applications as organic probes.







Abstract
The construction of C&#8722;N bond at the &#945;&#8208;position of BODIPYs (boron dipyrromethene) not only enables flexible reactivity but also leads to strong electron&#8208;donating properties. In this study, a base&#8208;promoted oxidative cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling was developed to synthesize &#945;&#8208;amino BODIPYs with air as a green oxidant. By this strategy, a series of weak nitrogen nucleophiles, such as heteroaryl and aryl anilines, were installed to the &#945;&#8208;position. Remarkably, pyrrole, pyrazole and indole were also employed to realize the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;heteroaryl BODIPYs through direct functionalization. Further aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIE) properties and lipid droplet&#8208;targeting bioimaging experiments of representative dyes demonstrated their potential applications as organic probes.

Since the milestone contribution by Chen and White in 2007, bioinspired non&#8208;heme bis&#8208;amino&#8208;bis&#8208;pyridylmethyl Fe complexes have been at the forefront of studies related to designing catalytic approaches for direct oxidative functionalization of aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds. This, however, has not developed into large&#8208;scale synthetic applications to date. The present concept is aimed at briefly discussing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of non&#8208;heme Fe catalyzed oxidations of organic molecules with H2O2, the current oxidant of choice of bioinspired oxidation catalysis, mostly focusing on C&#8722;H oxidations, and analyzing the peculiarities of their reactivity through the prism of potential applications in fine organic synthesis.

         <title>Sustainable Domino C&#8722;N/C&#8722;C Bond Formation with Outstanding E Factors and High Volume Productivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This newly developed single&#8208;flask, solvent&#8208;free process accomplishes sequential C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C bond formations. It leads to (&#946;&#8208;cyano)anilines by use of aryl triflates, Schiff bases, and CH3CN as a reagent. Key features of this neat method include a domino process, ambient temperature, short reaction time, and alignment with sustainability principles.







Abstract
One of the primary concerns in the development of new chemical reactions pertains to the choice of solvents, many of which can have harmful ecological impacts. Additionally, a major portion of waste generated in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries comes from the solvents employed. The elimination of solvent usage is highly desirable for creation of environmentally friendly chemical processes as it leads to a substantial reduction in waste production. Accordingly, a novel neat reaction was developed for the synthesis of (&#946;&#8208;amino)nitriles as a prominent moiety through a domino process. It involved the use of silylphenyl triflates, Schiff bases, and acetonitrile (CH3CN) in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio, among which CH3CN served as a starting material rather than a solvent. This reaction was initiated by caesium fluoride (CsF) to form an aryne through 1,2&#8208;elimination followed by sequential 1,2&#8208;addition, proton transfer, and a second 1,2&#8208;addition. Complete conversion was carried out at 25&#8201;&#176;C for 1.0&#8197;h to give (&#946;&#8208;amino)nitriles in 76&#8211;88&#8201;% yields. This solvent&#8208;free reaction minimized waste production and reduced costs associated with extra reagents, solvents, and labour. It possesses a compelling E factor and impressive volume productivity. This reaction sets a new benchmark for solvent&#8208;free aryne domino processes in green chemistry advancements.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of the Indolo[2,3&#8208;&#945;]quinolizine Alkaloid (+)&#8208;Cuscutamine via a Diastereoselective Intramolecular Pictet&#8208;Spengler Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise total synthesis of the natural product (11S, 13R)&#8208;Cuscutamine was achieved involving a diastereoselective intramolecular acyl iminium ion mediated Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction. The diastereoselectivity of the reaction is consistent with previous studies that proceed via more highly puckered transition states and the present results thus reveals the importance of the steric contribution to the diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
A concise total synthesis of Cuscutamine was achieved involving a diastereoselective intramolecular acyl iminium ion mediated Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction. This synthetic strategy provided a direct route to (11S, 13R)&#8208;Cuscutamine (2) in only 3 steps with an overall yield of 56&#8201;% and an enantiomeric ratio of 88&#8201;%. The diastereoselectivity of the reaction is consistent with previous studies that proceed via more highly puckered transition states and the present results thus reveal the importance of the steric contributions to the observed diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Alkynylation of Carbazoles with Alkynyl Bromides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct alkynylation of carbazoles, without the need for oxidants or sensitive reagents, has been developed. The broad substrate compatibility, scalability, and mechanistic insights underscore the method's significance for pharmaceutical and materials science applications.







Abstract
Carbazole derivatives are vital in medicinal and materials chemistry, yet accessing diverse substitutions remains challenging. Here, we introduce a regioselective approach for C1 and C8 alkynylation of carbazoles via palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation. This method provides a direct route to mono&#8208; and di&#8208;alkynylated derivatives, addressing the scarcity of alkynylated carbazole&#8208;based materials. Our study broadens the synthetic toolbox for carbazole functionalization, offering potential applications in optoelectronics, bio&#8208;imaging, and beyond, while contributing to developing sustainable C&#8722;H activation methodologies.
