         <title>New Approaches in Catalytic Reactions Using Triphos: A Classical Privileged Ligand</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over the past decades, multiple catalytic transformations have been feasible due to the application of triphos (1,1,1&#8208;tris((diphenylphosphino)methyl)ethane) as privileged ligand. This review highlights relevant advances in selected ruthenium&#8208; and cobalt&#8208;triphos catalysed reactions such as N&#8208;alkylation, formic acid dehydrogenation, and bond cleavages.

Over the past decades, multiple catalytic transformations have been feasible due to the application of triphos as ligand. Its particular fac coordination mode, to a transition metal center provides a suitable flexibility enabling variation on the coordination mode resulting in metal stabilization. Most of the reported catalytic reactions have been dominated by the use of the ruthenium&#8208;triphos system, either by application of well&#8208;defined complexes or the in&#8201;situ formed complex. However, in the last years, the emergence of cobalt complexes with comparable or even superior catalytic performance than ruthenium have been reported. In this review, the use of triphos is focussed in selected reactions such as N&#8208;alkylation, formic acid dehydrogenation, and bond cleavage.

         <title>Substrate Divergent 4&#960;/6&#960; Electrocyclization of CF3&#8208;Quinolone Heterodendralenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 38, October 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A substrate&#8208;dependent 4&#960;/6&#960; electrocyclization of in&#8201;situ generated CF3&#8208;heterodendralenes from 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;trifluoroacetyl quinolones is described. Phenyl substitution favors 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization to give CF3&#8208;substituted cyclobuta[c]quinolones bearing a CF3&#8208;containing quaternary center, while vinyl substitution promotes 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization to yield CF3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;phenanthridones.

Herein, a substrate&#8208;divergent 4&#960;/6&#960; electrocyclization of hitherto unknown CF3&#8208;heterodendralenes is disclosed, generated in&#8201;situ from the 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;trifluoroacetyl quinolones. The reaction favors 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization in the presence of a phenyl substituent, producing cyclobuta[c]quinolones featuring a challenging CF3&#8208;all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter. Conversely, vinyl substitution promotes 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization to provide CF3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;phenanthridones.

         <title>Tuning Glycosyl Donor Reactivity via Nitroarene Protecting Groups: A Semiarmed Strategy for Selective Glycosylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 38, October 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular strategy reports to tune glycosyl donor reactivity using nitroarene protecting groups. These groups suppress donor reactivity and can be chemically converted into activating groups, enabling a switchable system. This approach broadens the armed&#8211;disarmed glycosylation strategy and allows for efficient, selective oligosaccharide synthesis using precisely controlled donor reactivity.

Herein, a modular strategy for tuning the reactivity of glycosyl donors using nitroarene (NA) protecting groups such as 4&#8208;nitrobenzyl, 4&#8208;nitrobenzoyl, and 4&#8208;nitrophenyl. The electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of the nitro group markedly reduces donor reactivity, enabling selective activation. Notably, these NA groups can be readily transform into electron&#8208;donating pivaloylaminoarene (PA) and methoxycarbonylaminoarene (MCA) groups via nitro reduction followed by acylation or carbamation. This chemical conversion significantly enhances donor reactivity, offering a switchable reactivity platform. Relative reactivity values (RRVs), determined through competitive glycosylation, establish the reactivity trend: NA &lt; arene &lt; PA &lt; MCA. Applying this strategy, an efficient synthesis of a series of disaccharides is achieved, demonstrating its utility in extending the conventional armed&#8211;disarmed approach in glycosylation chemistry.

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Arylated Lactam&#8208;Type Iminosugars by Cascade Radical Cleavage of &#945;&#8208;Amino Carbonyl Compound and Intramolecular Amidation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 38, October 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and efficient one&#8208;pot protocol has been developed for the synthesis of diverse N&#8208;arylated lactam&#8208;type iminosugars or 4&#8208;aminobutanamide derivatives through cascade radical cleavage of &#945;&#8208;amino carbonyl compounds and intra&#8208;/intermolecular amidation reactions.

A metal&#8208;free method is developed for the synthesis of N&#8208;arylated lactam&#8208;type iminosugars using hydrogen peroxide (35% in water) as an oxidant. The reaction of various &#945;&#8208;amino carbonyl compounds is performed in methanol, and the active methylene adjacent to the carbonyl group is rapidly removed to form a carboxylic acid as the key intermediate through a cascade radical cleavage reaction. Following an intramolecular amidation reaction, a series of N&#8208;arylated lactam&#8208;type iminosugars are prepared in satisfactory yields, providing an alternative protocol for the synthesis of such bioactive iminosugars. Additionally, several 4&#8208;aminobutanamide derivatives are obtained by intermolecular amidation of the carboxylic acid intermediate.

         <title>Exhaustive Hydrodechlorination of Trichloroacetamides under Electrochemical Conditions at Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 38, October 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogenation of trichloroacetamides to afford structurally diverse acetamide derivatives is achieved under environmentally benign, mild electrochemical conditions through an iodide&#8208;mediated crucial halogen&#8208;bonding interaction. The reaction mechanism is fully established by control experiments and by in&#8201;situ cyclic voltammetry.

A simple yet efficient electrochemical method is developed for accessing acetamide derivatives from allylic trichloroacetamides derived from the Overman reaction, even though the transformation is synthetically challenging under reductive conditions. The proposed mechanistic pathway of the reaction is fully supported by control experiments and electrochemical studies. Other attractive features, such as inexpensive electrode material and electrolytes, minimal chemical waste, broad substrate scope, consistent yield, operational simplicity, and scalability, make this method appealing.

         <dc:description>
Spirocyclic compounds are key scaffolds in many drugs and other bioactive molecules. While cyclopropanation of allenes is relatively straightforward, synthesis of spirocyclic compounds from these substrates is scarce. We report a photocatalytic, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free cyclopropanation of allenoates with oxadiazolines as carbene precursors . Thioxanthone, serving as an energy transfer catalyst, enables mild reaction conditions and short reaction times.

Spirocyclic compounds are valuable scaffolds in medicinal chemistry and are important components of numerous drugs and other bioactive molecules. Although the cyclopropanation of allenes using typical methods is relatively straightforward, only limited approaches for the synthesis of spirocyclic compounds from allenoates have been reported. Herein, a photocatalytic, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free cyclopropanation of these substrates using oxadiazolines as a source of nucleophilic carbenes is described. The application of thioxanthone as an energy transfer catalyst under violet light irradiation enables the formation of alkylidenecyclopropanes in synthetically useful yields.

         <dc:description>
A photoinduced Ullmann&#8208;type C&#63743;P bond&#8208;forming reaction is accomplished at room temperature with no additional ligand. This method features broad substrate scope, scalability, and product transformation.

A photoinduced copper&#8208;catalyzed coupling of diphenylphosphine with aryl halides is reported. This efficient C(sp2)&#63743;P bond formation is realized by blue LED irradiation of a copper(I) catalyst at room temperature with no additional ligand. A variety of sterically demanding and functionalized substrates are applied under mild reaction conditions to provide the corresponding triarylphosphines in moderate to good yields.

A novel monofluoroallylsulfonium salt (MFAS) is synthesized from the inexpensive industrial chemical 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene in three steps with high efficiency. This reagent reacts readily with a series of alkylzinc reagents under copper catalysis to yield allylic monofluorides with high regioselectivity and excellent yields.

A bench&#8208;stable and scalable monofluoroallylsulfonium salt (MFAS) has been developed for highly regioselective mono&#8208;fluoroallylation. This reagent is synthesized from the inexpensive industrial chemical 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene in three steps with high efficiency. The reaction of alkylzinc reagents with MFAS proceeds smoothly under copper catalysis, yielding allylic monofluorides with excellent regioselectivity and high reaction efficiency. The synthetic utility of this reagent is demonstrated by transformations of the monofluoroallylated products.

A cycloaddition strategy for the synthesis of 10&#8208;aryl&#8208;11H&#8208;indeno[2,1&#8208;a]azulenes, as well as their derivatives, is presented. The work highlights improve reactivity using enamines from 1&#8208;indanone and pyrrolidine, followed by electrophilic chlorination and oxidation. Structural, optical, and electrochemical investigations elucidate unique properties, offering promising applications in organic electronic and photonic devices.

An efficient synthesis of 10&#8208;aryl&#8208;11H&#8208;indeno[2,1&#8208;a]azulenes has achieved via [8&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition between 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;cyclohepta[b]furan&#8208;2&#8208;ones with an enamine is generated from 1&#8208;indanone and pyrrolidine in good yields. Oxidation of 10&#8208;aryl&#8208;11H&#8208;indeno[2,1&#8208;a]azulenes with 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;p&#8208;benzoquinone in aqueous acetone shows complete decomposition, whereas chlorinated derivatives undergoes the oxidation to afford the corresponding azuleno[2,1&#8208;a]indenones in moderate to good yields. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals that the 11H&#8208;indeno[2,1&#8208;a]azulene and azuleno[2,1&#8208;a]indenone cores are remarkably planar, while the appended aryl groups adopt a nearly orthogonal orientation owing to steric hindrance, thereby limiting conjugative interactions. Ultraviolet&#8208;visible and fluorescence spectroscopic investigations, supported by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations, indicated that the optical transitions are predominantly localized on the azulene unit and are subtly modulated by the electronic nature of the aryl substituents. In addition, electrochemical studies also demonstrate systematic variations in redox potentials according to the electronic characteristics of the aryl groups.

         <title>Multigram Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation of Functionalized Terminal Alkynes with B2Pin2</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 38, October 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Application of cheap and accessible reactants for copper&#8208;mediated borylation of functionalized terminal alkynes is described. Based on the thorough assessment of different ligands/additives for various types of substrates, a simple decision tree for the optimal reaction condition choice is proposed. Using the developed methodology, a series of synthetically valuable alkenyl boronates is prepared on 10&#8211;300&#8201;g scale in single run.

A comprehensive study of the commercially available ligands/additives in the formal copper&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration reaction of functionalized terminal alkynes is described. Based on the common reaction system (CuCl&#8211;B2Pin2), a set of common and inexpensive ligands or additives&#8212;namely, rac&#8208;BINAP, PPh3, [(t&#8208;Bu)3PH]BF4, and LiCl&#8212;is tested for its effects on the borylation regioselectivity and overall reaction efficiency. The results observed demonstrate correlation between the substrate nature (propargylic, homopropargylic, or higher homolog) and the ligand, which can be used for the preferential preparation of linear or branched isomer of the target alkenyl boronic species. It is found that LiCl and (t&#8208;Bu)3P can be used for preparation of &#946;&#8208;substituted alkenyl boronates, whereas &#945;&#8208;substituted isomers are preferentially obtained in the presence of triarylphopsphine ligands. The scope of the transformations covers derivatives of protected (homo)propargylic alcohols and amines and tolerated free alcohol, ether, silyl ether, ketal, ester, and alkene moieties. The practical utility of the discussed methodologies is proven by the multigram preparation of target building blocks (10&#8230;100&#8201;g for over 20 boronates, up to 300&#8201;g&#8212;for a few selected representatives).

The practical utility of the discussed methodologies is proven by the multigram preparation of target building blocks (10&#8230;100&#8201;g for over 20 boronates, up to 300&#8201;g&#8212;for a few selected representatives).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Latent&#8208;Functionality&#8208;Based Synthesis of the Furanoside Motif of Hygromycin A</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 38, October 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A latent functionality strategy is employed to construct the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketone motif within the sugar fragment of hygromycin A through the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of furan. Facile epimerization at the C5 position enables access to both the natural congeners of hygromycin A and structurally modified derivatives for potential medicinal applications.

Hygromycin A, a once&#8208;forgotten antibiotic first isolated in 1953, is recently rediscovered as a novel inhibitor of Lyme disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi. Given the increasing resistance of gut microbes to antibiotic treatments, there is an urgent need for new therapies with novel mechanisms of action. The molecular architecture of hygromycin A, characterized by its fragmented structure, makes it an appealing platform for derivatization. In this study, it develops a latent functionality strategy to introduce the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketone motif into the sugar fragment via the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of furan. The facile epimerization at the C5 position enables a rapid access congeners of hygromycin A. Furthermore, glycosylation with phenol derivatives provides a versatile method for establishing the unique stereogenic center of the furanoside in this class of compounds.

         <title>Multicomponent Synthesis of Fluorine&#8208;Containing Bioactive Compounds and Drugs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 38, October 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicomponent reactions are robust synthetic tools to assamble complex polyheterocycles and other interesting molecular architectures with potential application in medicinal chemistry, including their fluorine&#8208;containing analogues. Fluorine atoms placed strategically into bioactive molecules often enhance essential pharmacokinetic parameters like bioavailability, lipophilicity and metabolic resistance. Indeed, various marketed drugs contain fluorine atoms in their structures.

It is well known that fluorine atoms placed strategically into bioactive molecules often enhance essential pharmacokinetic parameters like bioavailability, lipophilicity, and metabolic resistance. In the same way, a relatively broad spectrum of marketed drugs contains one or more fluorine atoms in their structures, usually in the form of fluorine&#8208;, difluoromethyl&#8208;, trifluoromethyl&#8208;, or perfluoroalkyl aromatic moieties, being essential parts of their corresponding pharmacophores. Besides, multicomponent reactions (MCR) are highly convergent one&#8208;pot processes in which three or more smartly substituted/functionalized reagents are combined simultaneously, sequentially or consecutively, in the same reactor to assemble complex products (including polyheterocycles) containing most or all atoms from the reagents. Thus, the scope of the present review is to discuss selected MCR&#8208;based works since 2009 for the synthesis of bioactive compounds and drugs that contain at least one fluorine atom in their structures, as well as relevant results from in silico, in&#8201;vitro, and/or in&#8201;vivo studies against a variety of important target biomolecules, highlighting the role of fluorine&#8208;containing moieties.

         <title>Point&#8208;to&#8208;Axis Optical Activity Induction in Extended, Sterically Congested Chromophoric Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of terephthalaldehyde derivatives has been tested as a chirality sensor for primary amines. The central unit of the probe serves as an amine binder by forming imine bonds and is flanked by two extended chromophoric units. The impact of modifying the wings with diphenylamine or carbazole units, which affects the properties of the probes, is discussed.

The readily available, modular, and electronic circular dichroism (ECD)&#8208;silent derivatives of terephthalaldehyde (the probes) have exhibited an induced optical activity (OA) upon condensation with chiral primary amines. The central unit of the probe serves as an amine binder by forming imine bonds and is flanked by two extended chromophoric units (the wings). Modification of the wings by diphenylamine or carbazole units affects the sterical and spectroscopic properties of the probes. An increase in sterical congestion within the probe core results in a change in the mechanism of OA induction. In the more congested systems, the point&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transmission from the chiral amine (the inducer) to the chromophoric system leads to the adaptation of helical conformation by &#8220;the wings&#8221; and the appearance of nonzero Cotton effects in the low&#8208;energy part of the ECD spectrum. However, the sterically congested probes are sensitive to the chirality of the inducers but relatively indifferent to the differences in their structure. Thus, the chirality of the inducers triggers conformational change toward the thermodynamically preferred conformational diastereoisomer due to the probe's &#8722;1 to +1 operation scheme.

Quantum mechanical tunneling, an alternative reaction pathway to the classical thermal one, is rarely considered in organic synthesis. However, there is growing evidence of its profound impacts, for example, in limiting access to target molecules or determining reaction outcomes. This article highlights recent exemplary studies and explores how concepts like tunneling control and instability can inform synthesis design and optimization.

Quantum mechanical tunneling offers an alternative dynamical pathway to the classical (thermal) overcoming of energetic barriers, by penetrating these barriers instead. Recent years have shed light on its impact on organic synthesis in terms of kinetics, reaction outcomes, and lifetimes (and thus feasibility) of reactive intermediates or supposedly stable products. This concept article summarizes recent computational and experimental studies and illuminates how the insights from these studies, for example, regarding the concepts of tunneling control and instability, should inform synthesis design and optimization.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Convergent Synthesis of Heterocyclic Compounds via C&#63743;H Activation/Cyclization: An Overview and Summary Toward Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current progress in tandem C&#63743;H activation reactions involving terminal alkynes. It predominantly covers the synthesis of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered heterocycles, as well as fused heterocycles, with an emphasis on specific topics, including purely chemical synthesis, electrochemical synthesis, and enantioselective synthesis.

The development of one&#8208;step transformations to heterocyclic compounds would considerably boost the synthetic efficiency in organic chemistry. In recent years, numerous examples of the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed (TMC) C&#63743;H activation/annulation strategy have been reported. Despite remarkable progress achieved with internal alkynes, allenes, and alkyne surrogates, terminal alkynes remain challenging substrates. Due to their relatively acidic terminal protons, terminal alkynes easily undergo alternative homocoupling reactions under commonly used oxidative conditions, exhibiting significant difficulties in C&#63743;H functionalizations. To date, the C&#63743;H activation involving terminal alkynes remains one of the most promising and appealing areas in organic synthesis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current progress in tandem C&#63743;H activation reactions with terminal alkynes. With a strong emphasis on the catalysis of Rh and Co transition metals, it predominantly covers the synthesis of five&#8208;, six&#8208;membered heterocycles, and fused heterocycles. In this protocol, specific topics, such as purely chemical synthesis, electrochemical synthesis, and enantioselective synthesis, mechanistic details associated with the documented reactions are discussed. In addition, a tactical user guidance for terminal alkynes&#8208;participated C&#63743;H activation is also put forward.

         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H bond functionalization protocol for 1&#8208;naphthylamine derivatives is reported, enabling efficient and regioselective synthesis of 8&#8208;benzylated 1&#8208;naphthylamides directly from aryl aldehydes via benzylic C&#63743;H activation. Utilizing a bidentate directing group strategy, the reaction exhibits broad substrate tolerance with good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. The methodology effectively combines photochemical reactivity with Pd catalysis in a flow microreactor setup, facilitating the capture and use of short&#8208;lived reactive intermediates.

Herein, a continuous photo&#8208;flow protocol for quinolinamide&#8208;directed regioselective C&#8208;8 benzylation of 1&#8208;naphthylamine derivatives via C&#63743;H bond functionalization with flow&#8208;generated aryldiazomethanes is reported. A wide range of 8&#8208;benzylated&#8208;1&#8208;naphthylamide products are afforded in satisfactory yields upon palladium catalysis via a bidentate directing process under illumination by 12&#8201;W blue light&#8208;emitting diodes (450&#8201;nm). This mild, simple, and convenient synthetic method allows a wide range of easily handled aryl aldehydes, without the exclusion of either moisture or oxygen. This transformation is environmentally friendly and operationally simple, and it can be easily scaled up to the gram scale with good selectivity. Finally, an improved protocol for C&#63743;H functionalization is described, which relies on the use of a continuous&#8208;flow photo&#8208;microreactor.

         <title>A Greener Approach to 2,5&#8208;Furandicarboxylate Macrocycles and their Entropically Driven Ring Opening Polymerization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid&#8208;based polymers are obtained through the entropically driven ring&#8208;opening polymerization of the corresponding macrocyclic oligoesters (MCOs). MCOs are synthesized using cyclopentyl methyl ether as a green solvent and purified without column chromatography. Properties of the resulting polyesters are evaluated and compared between the different techniques.

Thermoplastic polyesters (PEs), with their versatile properties, are indispensable in everyday life. However, increasing concerns about the environmental impact of fossil&#8208;based polymers have driven research into renewable alternatives. Among bio&#8208;based polymers, furan&#8208;derived PEs such as poly(ethylene furanoate) (PEF) have garnered significant attention. The synthesis of PEF, as well as other similar 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA)&#8208;based polymers, is mainly based on bulk polycondensation (PC) that in general requires elevated temperatures and low pressure, making the process energy&#8208;intensive and vulnerable to thermo&#8208;oxidative degradation. In this view, entropically driven ring opening polymerization (ED&#8208;ROP) might represent an interesting potential alternative since it requires milder conditions and is intrinsically more atom economic. From these premises, this work focuses on developing an alternative synthetic strategy to bio&#8208;based PEs through ED&#8208;ROP of macrocycles derived from FDCA dimethyl ester (FDME). These macrocycles were prepared by reacting FDME with diols via pseudo&#8208;high dilution condensation (PHDC) using dibutyltin(IV) oxide as a catalyst and cyclopentyl methyl ether as a recyclable green solvent. Isolation of the pure macrocycles is achieved by simple crystallization from the reaction mixture. Subsequent ROP of pure macrocycles is investigated as a viable route to prepare the related PEs in mild reaction conditions.

The parent 5,5&#8242;&#8208;binaphtho[2,1&#8208;d]isoxazole and its 3,3&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl and 3,3&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl derivatives are synthesized via condensation of the respective dicarbonyl compounds with hydroxylamine, followed by cyclodehydration of the resulting dioximes. The dicarbonyl precursors are obtained through 4&#8208; or 6&#8208;step sequences from 1&#8208;naphthol or 1&#8208;naphthaldehyde, involving oxidation, methylation, demethylation, coupling, bromination, formylation, esterification, and Fries rearrangement.

[1,1&#8242;&#8208;Binaphthalene]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diol (BINOL) analog, [1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;diol, obtained by direct oxidative coupling of 1&#8208;naphthol, is acylated to [1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;diyl diacetate and then rearranged by the Fries reaction to 1,1'&#8208;{4,4'&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;[1,1'&#8208;binaphthalene]&#8208;3,3'&#8208;diyl}bis(ethan&#8208;1&#8208;one). Incorporation of aldehyde groups at the 3,3' positions of [1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;diol required oxidative coupling of 1&#8208;methoxynaphthalene to 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene, bromination, formylation, and demethylation. Incorporation of benzoyl groups at the 3,3' positions of [1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;diol required subjecting either 1&#8208;(4&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;naphthyl)(phenyl)methanone to the Ullmann reaction conditions or 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene to the Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction with benzoyl chloride. The 1,1&#8242;&#8208;(4,4&#8242;&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;diyl)dicarbonyls are converted to the corresponding dioximes, which then underwent cyclodehydration to the respective novel 5,5'&#8208;binaphtho[2,1&#8208;d]isoxazoles.

Incorporation of aldehyde groups at the 3,3&lt;i&gt;'&lt;/i&gt; positions of [1,1&#8242;-binaphthalene]-4,4&#8242;-diol required oxidative coupling of 1-methoxynaphthalene to 4,4&#8242;-dimethoxy-1,1&#8242;-binaphthalene, bromination, formylation, and demethylation. Incorporation of benzoyl groups at the 3,3&lt;i&gt;'&lt;/i&gt; positions of [1,1&#8242;-binaphthalene]-4,4&#8242;-diol required subjecting either 1-(4-bromo-1-hydroxy-2-naphthyl)(phenyl)methanone to the Ullmann reaction conditions or 4,4&#8242;-dimethoxy-1,1&#8242;-binaphthalene to the Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction with benzoyl chloride. The 1,1&#8242;-(4,4&#8242;-dihydroxy-1,1&#8242;-binaphthalene-3,3&#8242;-diyl)dicarbonyls are converted to the corresponding dioximes, which then underwent cyclodehydration to the respective novel 5,5&lt;i&gt;'&lt;/i&gt;-binaphtho[2,1-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]isoxazoles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A sustainable, ultrasound&#8208;assisted intramolecular (3&#8201;+&#8201;2) cycloaddition in water enables efficient one&#8208;pot access to fused&#8208;pyrrolizidine and indolizidine scaffolds. The method offers high atom economy, low E&#8208;factor, and reveals a striking mechanistic divergence between ultrasound and thermal pathways. Its practicality is showcased through gram&#8208;scale synthesis, late&#8208;stage functionalization, and potent anticancer activity against triple&#8208;negative breast cancer.

         <title>Amidine Syntheses from Classic to Contemporary for Medicinal Lead Compounds and Natural Products</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A revolution is underway in the synthesis of amidines with new methods unlocking complex, highly substituted amidines or closely related derivatives such as N&#8208;sulfonyl amidines. This review surveys recent advances in amidines and related compounds, including methods to install them and bioactive molecules prominently featuring the amidine functionality.

For close to 150&#8201;years, the Pinner reaction between nitriles and amines dominated the syntheses of amidines. Today, the Pinner reaction remains highly over&#8208;represented in recent syntheses of unsubstituted or simple amidines. However, a number of greener amidine syntheses unlock access to more complex, highly substituted amidines, or closely related derivatives such as N&#8208;sulfonyl amidines. This review surveys recent advances in amidines and related compounds, including methods to install them and bioactive molecules prominently featuring the amidine functionality. Complex amidines are readily synthesized using both traditional and multicomponent reactions, which often involve metals. Recent trends include metal&#8208;free methodologies and expanded structural diversity of amidine products. The second half of this article reviews the utility of amidines as carbonyl bioisosteres for natural products, functional linkers, or as a bioactive functional group. The biological activities of recently reported amidine&#8208;based compounds will be surveyed with an emphasis on promising antibacterial and antiproliferative compounds.

A methodology for the preparation of imines from amines by means of an electrocatalytic aminoxyl&#8208;mediated reaction.

A methodology is reported for the preparation of imines from amines by means of an electrocatalytic aminoxyl&#8208;mediated reaction. It is performed using readily available electrodes in a commercially available electrochemistry apparatus and does not require the use of a reference electrode. The methodology proceeds under mild conditions and delivers good to excellent isolated yields across a range of structurally diverse benzyl amines. Selectivity is high, with imines obtained in preference to the more commonly reported nitriles, and the process is readily scalable to the gram level. Operational simplicity and short reaction times make this method a valuable addition to the organic chemist's toolkit.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of 3,4&#8208;Disubstituted Pyrroles Through Three&#8208;Component Van Leusen Reaction of Propargylamines with Tosylmethyl Isocyanide and Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel three&#8208;component strategy for the synthesis of valuable 3,4&#8208;disubstituted pyrroles from easily available propargylamines, tosylmethyl isocyanide, and water in the presence of DBU has been developed.

A novel three&#8208;component van Leusen strategy has been developed for the efficient and straightforward synthesis of valuable 3,4&#8208;disubstituted pyrroles from easily available propargylamines, tosylmethyl isocyanide, and water. This transformation advances through the formation of a pyrrole framework via [3&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition with tosylmethyl isocyanide and a sequential nucleophilic substitution, ring&#8208;opening, and deprotonation/protonation cascade process. This reaction provides a convenient modular access to pyrrole derivatives with aryl and benzoyl groups through the formation of three new bonds and one heterocycle from readily available acyclic precursors in a single step.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manuscript reports a chelation&#8208;induced remote C&#63743;H functionalization of 8&#8208;aminoquinolinamides with p&#8208;quinone methides as alkylating agents. The method enables efficient coupling across diverse quinolinamides, demonstrating broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance.

Herein, a straightforward approach is reported for the palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative remote C&#63743;H alkylation of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline derivatives using para&#8208;quinone methides. This method enables selective C5&#8208;alkylation of quinolines and exhibits a site&#8208;selectivity distinct from that typically observed in convetional palladium&#8208;catalyzed sp2 C&#63743;H activation. The reaction proceeds via chelation&#8208;induced remote C&#63743;H functionalization, and a broad range of quinolinamides are successfully coupled with p&#8208;quinone methides, demonstrating excellent substrate scope and functional group tolerance. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest a reversible C&#63743;H metalation step as part of the catalytic cycle.

Electrochemical Tandem Cyclization of N&#8208;(But&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl)Anilines to Access Trifluoromethylated Tetrahydroquinoline Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a series of 34 trifluoromethylated tetrahydroquinoline derivatives were synthesized through a one&#8208;step trifluoromethylation/cyclization cascade reaction, enabling the simultaneous construction of two C&#63742;C bonds. This transformation was achieved using a green and efficient electrocatalytic approach, without requiring metal catalysts. Control experiments suggest that the reaction likely proceeds via a radical&#8208;initiated mechanism.

A novel electrochemical cascade strategy enables dual C&#63742;C bond formation through trifluoromethylation and C(sp2)&#8208;H functionalization of N&#8208;(but&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl)anilines derivatives. This protocol efficiently constructs structurally diverse trifluoromethylated tetrahydroquinoline derivatives in moderate to good yields. It operates under mild reaction conditions, uses readily available substrates, proceeds without metal catalysts, and achieves the construction of two C&#63742;C bonds in a single step. Detailed mechanistic studies demonstrate that a sequential single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process triggers the radical cascade reaction.

         <title>Spiro[3.3]heptane: A Versatile sp3&#8208;Rich Scaffold and its Synthetic Routes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sp3&#8208;rich spiro[3.3]heptane scaffold is a saturated, 3D bioisostere of benzene. This review summarizes key synthetic strategies, including [2+2] cyclizations and bond disconnections at C1&#63743;C2 or C4 (spiro&#8208;carbon) positions, offering a practical guide for accessing this emerging motif and expanding drug&#8208;like chemical space.

Among the growing class of sp3&#8208;rich scaffolds, spiro[3.3]heptane stands out for its rigid, 3D structure and favorable physicochemical properties. Its 3D saturated scaffold enables access to unique, nonplanar chemical space and has been explored as a saturated bioisostere of benzene in drug design. In this review, an overview of synthetic strategies developed to construct spiro[3.3]heptane derivatives is provided. These approaches are grouped according to key synthetic strategies, including formal [2+2] cyclization and bond disconnections at C1&#63743;C2 or C4 (spiro&#8208;carbon) positions. Representative examples are presented to illustrate each method's key transformations and strategic bond formations. This review is intended to support synthetic chemists interested in employing spiro[3.3]heptane as a building block and to provide a foundation for further exploration of this emerging motif.

         <title>Asymmetric Hydrosilylation of Ketones Catalyzed by Diaminocyclohexane/Zinc Complexes: A Comparative Study and Mechanistic Insight</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective hydrosilylation catalyzed by zinc with two ligands derived from cyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine is investigated. The reaction is fast, achieving complete conversion in minutes, with alcohol products showing e.e. up to 94%. Density functional theory calculations indicate that a zinc hydride intermediate, formed through ligand&#8208;selective silylation, is likely responsible for the catalytic activity.

The catalytic enantioselective hydrosilylation activity of zinc is investigated in the presence of two ligands derived from cyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine: N,N&#8242;&#8208;dibenzylcyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine (1) and a cage&#8208;like structure composed of six cyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine units (2). The reaction proceeds rapidly, achieving complete conversion within minutes and affording alcohol products with enantiomeric excesses of up to 94%. Despite the favorable results with the cage&#8208;like ligand (2), no significant advantage over ligand (1) is observed. In a second part, to gain insight into the reaction mechanism, various mechanistic experiments are conducted alongside density functional theory calculations. The findings suggest that ligand&#8208;selective silylation leads to the formation of a zinc hydride species, which is likely the active catalytic intermediate in this system.

         <title>Synthesis of Bioorthogonal Mycolic Acids: Chemoselective Reduction of &#946;&#8208;Ketoesters Containing an Alkyne Using the Noyori Catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal mycolic acids that are suitable probes for the study of the cell envelope of mycobacteria are synthesized by Noyori reduction of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters featuring a protected terminal alkyne. The triisopropylsilyl group is found to be very efficient in preventing the reduction of the alkyne. The prepared compounds will be of great interest for the study of mycomembrane biogenesis.

The asymmetric reduction of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters using the Noyori catalyst is a highly effective synthetic methodology, offering excellent stereocontrol for the preparation of enantiopure &#946;&#8208;hydroxyesters from prochiral substrates in high yields. This reaction has been used in the total synthesis of mycolic acids, which are &#945;&#8208;alkyl, &#946;&#8208;hydroxy fatty acids forming the main part of the mycobacterial cell outer membrane. Recently, the metabolism of mycobacteria has been explored using the chemical reporter strategy with bioorthogonal analogs or precursors of mycolic acids. Introducing a bioorthogonal alkyne into these compounds is a challenging task and particularly valuable for subsequent probe attachment via click chemistry. This work presents approaches for the synthesis of several alkyne&#8208;containing mycolic acids featuring the native structure of natural mycolic acids. The chemoselectivity of the enantioselective reduction of several &#946;&#8208;ketoesters using the Noyori catalyst in the presence of a protected terminal alkyne group is investigated. Conditions have been optimized to ensure that the alkyne remains intact during the reduction process. This study provides valuable tools for further mycomembrane studies using the CuAAC reaction and the optimized conditions extends the possibilities in the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters with an alkyne function.

         <title>Chemoselective Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Silyl Esters and Silyl Phosphonates over Cyclopropanation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalized allyl and vinyl silanes using diazo compounds in the presence of 1&#8201;mol% of [Cp*RuCl2]n as a catalyst, at 0&#8211;50&#8201;&#176;C, and CH3CN as a solvent, chemoselectively yielded &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated silyl esters and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated silyl phosphonate esters with good yields over the cyclopropanation. The plausible reaction mechanism has been realized with the help of density functional theory studies.

&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated silyl esters are an important class of compounds in organic, inorganic, and pharmaceutical chemistry, known for their versatility and unique reactivity.

         <title>A Density Functional Theory&#8208;Genetic Algorithm Approach for the Structural Elucidation of Linear Diamantane Polyesters and their Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diamondoid polyesters emit white light upon continuous infrared laser irradiation. The structures of the polyesters are microcrystalline as determined with solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy combined with computational analyzes.

We report a series of diamantane polyesters synthesized as head&#8208;to&#8208;head and side&#8208;to&#8208;side linear chain polymers. The incorporation of the bulky and rigid diamantyl moiety significantly enhances the thermal stabilities of these polymers compared to well&#8208;established linear aliphatic polyesters, such as poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone), poly(lactic acid), poly(butylene succinate), and poly(glycolic acid). This enhancement is confirmed by thermogravimetric analyzes, which show degradation onsets in the range of 520 to 580&#8201;&#176;C. The structural characterization of these polyesters posed significant challenges due to virtual insolubility in organic solvents, limiting the use of techniques such as mass spectrometry and liquid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. To address these challenges, a genetic algorithm for structure prediction based on periodic density functional theory computations was employed, yielding a structure that closely matches the powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data. Heavily constrained Rietveld refinement provided excellent agreement with the experimental results. These findings, combined with solid&#8208;state NMR data, have been integrated to provide a comprehensive understanding of the polyester properties. These polyesters demonstrate promising nonlinear optical responses, including white&#8208;light emission upon continuous infrared laser irradiation, making them candidates for optoelectronic applications.

         <dc:description>
1,2&#8208;Sulfonylative&#8208;arylation of N&#8208;phenyl acrylamides has been achieved under visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis conditions. Strained 3&#176;&#8208;cyclopropanols and 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;DHPs are exploited to trigger the acrylamide bisfunctionalization in the presence of SO2 for accessing S(VI) functionalized oxindoles bearing a &#946;&#8208;all&#8208;carbon quaternary center in moderate to good yields.

&#947;&#8208;Keto sulfones, despite being a medicinally relevant building block, have never been integrated with the bioactive oxindole scaffold present in several alkaloid natural products. On the other hand, strategies involving SO2 capture in organic molecules to access value&#8208;added products are gaining momentum. Therefore, a strategy en route to &#947;&#8208;keto alkylsulfonylated oxindoles bearing a &#946;&#8208;all&#8208;carbon quaternary center is disclosed. Toward this goal, the bisfunctionalization of N&#8208;(hetero)arylacrylamides has been realized via the strain&#8208;release driven ring&#8208;scission of strained 3&#176;&#8208;cyclopropanols in the presence of DABSO under visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis to access a library of &#947;&#8208;keto alkylsulfonylated oxindoles. Also, the aromaticity&#8208;driven bond&#8208;scission in pro&#8208;aromatics like 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;DHPs in the presence of Na2S2O5 under visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis has been exploited to trigger the alkylsulfonylative&#8208;arylation of N&#8208;(hetero)arylacrylamides to access a library of alkylsulfonylated oxindoles featuring a &#946;&#8208;all&#8208;carbon quaternary center. Broad substrate scope is demonstrated, and the mechanistic probing studies have been complemented with DFT calculations. Also, moderate to potent cytotoxic activity is observed against the tested triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cell lines for some of the synthesized sulfonylated oxindole derivatives. Further, evaluation of the mechanism of cell death for the most potent oxindole analog revealed that it induces apoptosis in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner.

         <title>A New Methodology for Preparing Benzylated Aminopyridines Yields Previously Inaccessible Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnBr2&#8208;induced benzylation of 4&#8208;aminopyridineswith suitable alcohols or diols provides access to novel organocatalysts of the unprecedented diarylpyrrolidionopyridine type, as well as new benzylmethylaminopyridine catalysts. These catalysts are practically inaccessible by other routes and exhibit high activity and site selectivity in the phosphorylation of amphiphilic diols.

p&#8208;Dialkylaminopyridines represent a key class of nucleophilic organocatalysts, widely used in alcohol&#8208;modifying reactions, among other applications. However, access to certain variants of these catalysts, particularly those with sterically congested secondary sphere, remains challenging or even unfeasible using previously established synthetic routes. Lewis acid&#8208;promoted benzylation or cyclative dibenzylation of simple aminopyridines with corresponding alcohols effectively overcomes these shortcomings. This innovative approach enables the synthesis of previously inaccessible (2,5&#8208;diarylpyrrolidino)pyridines and novel (N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;N&#8208;methylamino)pyridines bearing extended ortho&#8208;alkoxy tails on the aryl substituents. The new catalysts, characterized by their bulky secondary sphere, exhibit outstanding activity and high site&#8208;selectivity in the phosphorylation of a model diol amphiphile.

         <title>A New Paradigm for the Supramolecular Structure of Laterally Offset Diarenes: Polymorphs II of Para&#8208;Substituted Acetophenone Azines, Yp&#63743;Ph&#63743;(Me)C&#63742;N&#63743;N&#63742;C(Me)&#63743;Ph&#63743;Yp (Y&#8201;=&#8201;Cl, Br, CH3)</title>

         <dc:description>
While polymorphs I contain C2&#8208;symmetric enantiomers with pronounced azine twists and disrotatory phenyl twists, the acetophenone azine molecules in the new polymorphs II are Ci&#8208;symmetric with trans azine moieties and conrotatory phenyl twists. The three polymorphs II exemplify the new Paradigm IV for the supramolecular architectures of &#8220;laterally offset diarenes&#8221; and result in &#8220;shiplap/flat&#8221; idioteloamphiphile monolayers (IAMs).

The crystal structures of polymorphs II of acetophenone azines Yp&#63743;Ph&#63743;RC&#63742;N&#63743;N&#63742;CR&#63743;Ph&#63743;Yp with R&#8201;=&#8201;CH3 and Y&#8201;=&#8201;Cl (1M), Br (2M), and CH3 (8M) are discussed. The azine molecules in polymorphs II are Ci&#8208;symmetric with trans&#8208;azine moieties and conrotatory phenyl twists. Polymorphs 1M&#8208;I and 2M&#8208;I contain C2&#8208;symmetric enantiomers with pronounced azine twists and disrotatory phenyl twists and allow for strong lateral double T&#8208;contacts. The three polymorphs II exemplify the new Paradigm IV for the supramolecular architectures of &#8220;laterally offset diarenes&#8221; and result in &#8220;shiplap/flat&#8221; idioteloamphiphile monolayers. Intralayer lateral attraction is provided by edge&#8208;to&#8208;face arene&#8208;arene contacts between molecules with substantial longitudinal offset and involves arene edges bridging one azine&#8208;N and one phenyl center (EAzArB synthon) or one phenyl center and substituent Y (EYArB synthon) of different neighbors. These bridging synthons are characterized by a survey of pertinent structure parameters and their structural significance is corroborated by analysis of distance mapped Hirshfeld surfaces and the computation of 2D&#8208;fingerprint plots. The edge&#8208;to&#8208;face contacts are the most attractive intermolecular interactions, and these interactions are quantified via the computed pair interaction energies and the results of aromatic analyzer analysis. Synthon binding energies and lattice energies are determined to assess polymorph preference energies.

Intralayer lateral attraction is provided by edge-to-face arene-arene contacts between molecules with substantial longitudinal offset and involves arene edges bridging one azine-N and one phenyl center (EAzArB synthon) or one phenyl center and substituent Y (EYArB synthon) of different neighbors. These bridging synthons are characterized by a survey of pertinent structure parameters and their structural significance is corroborated by analysis of distance mapped Hirshfeld surfaces and the computation of 2D-fingerprint plots. The edge-to-face contacts are the most attractive intermolecular interactions, and these interactions are quantified via the computed pair interaction energies and the results of aromatic analyzer analysis. Synthon binding energies and lattice energies are determined to assess polymorph preference energies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Doped Hydrotalcite: A Heterogeneous Catalyst for the Selective Synthesis of 2&#8208;Substituted Benzimidazoles and Benzothiazoles Using Alcohols and Solvent&#8208;Free Reaction Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;doped calcium aluminium hydrotalcite was synthesised and employed for the selective synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted benzimidazoles and benzothiazoles. The developed protocol uses low oxidation chemicals (alcohols) under solvent&#8208;free reaction conditions, recyclable catalyst and broad substrate scope. Mechanistic study provides an insight into the mechanism of the reaction.

A heterogeneous iron&#8208;anchored calcium aluminum hydrotalcite is prepared and characterized appropriately using powder X&#8208;Ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X&#8208;Ray, transmission electron microscope, ourier&#8208;transform infrared, and thermogravimetric analysis. Further, X&#8208;Ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the presence of Fe in +3 oxidation state. The prepared heterogeneous catalyst is applied to the selective synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted benzimidazole and benzothiazole derivatives using alcohols and under solvent&#8208;free reaction conditions. The developed protocol is applicable to a broad range of substrates, including difficult aliphatic substrates. The Fe/CaAl hydrotalcite catalyst can also be recycled and reused effectively for two catalytic cycles. Furthermore, control experiments reveal the role of the catalyst and the plausible mechanistic pathway of the reaction.

         <title>A Family of Methylene&#8208;Bridged Fully Functionalized Polynitroarenes and Tetrazole&#8208;Based Energetic Materials</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of methylene&#8208;bridged fully functionalized polynitroarenes and tetrazole&#8208;based energetic materials is reported. This approach enables the modification of the energetic properties of polynitroarenes by mono&#8208; and tricationic salt formation.

Herein, to fine&#8208;tune the energetic properties of 2,4,6&#8208;trinitrobenzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;diamine/diol, these are combined with tetrazole via a methylene bridge. This strategy unlocks the tunability of polynitroarenes performances via salt formation, which is restricted in directly C&#63743;N connected polynitroarenes and azole derivatives. The amino/hydroxy functionalities between the nitro groups on the benzene ring provide extensive inter&#8208; and intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions, contributing to improved stability, whereas the tetrazole ring increases the nitrogen percentage and energetic performance. Due to the presence of one and three labile protons in the amino derivative (compounds 4) and hydroxy derivative (compounds 5), respectively, a series of mono&#8208; and tricationic salts are prepared to further fine&#8208;tune the overall performances. Among all the synthesized compounds, the tricationic energetic salt 10 (Dv&#8201;=&#8201;8135&#8201;m&#8201;s&#8722;1, IS&#8201;&gt;&#8201;40&#8201;J) exhibits energetic performance comparable to TATB and is insensitive. All the compounds are characterized through infrared spectroscopy, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, elemental analysis, and high&#8208;resolution mass spectra studies. The relationship between structure and properties is further explored using Hirshfeld surface, noncovalent interaction, Localized Orbital Locator (LOL)&#8208;&#960;, and electrostatic potential analysis.

         <title>The Nonlinear Optical Behavior of Linear Diamantane Polyamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diamondoid&#8208;based polyamides exhibit nonlinear optical properties, namely, they emit white light upon continuous&#8208;wave irradiation with infrared lasers. The use of diamantane monomers significantly enhances the thermal stability of such novel polyamides, thereby opening new avenues for efficient and durable, organic lighting applications.

We report the synthesis and characterization of a new family of single&#8208;component polyamides incorporating rigid diamantane monomers, and investigate their structural, thermal, and nonlinear optical properties. These polymers are largely amorphous and exhibit exceptional thermal stability, with decomposition events in the 400&#8211;600&#8201;&#176;C range, significantly exceeding those of conventional nylons such as nylon&#8208;6 and nylon&#8208;66. Thermal analysis further shows that polyamides containing aromatic units retain higher residual yields than purely aliphatic analogues. Powder X&#8208;Ray diffraction, dynamic light scattering, and scanning electron microscopy reveal pronounced morphological differences, ranging from irregular nanoscale particulates to smooth, rubbery domains. A direct correlation between morphology and optical behavior is observed: polyamides with disordered or finely particulate structures display intrinsic white&#8208;light emission (WLE, 490&#8211;700&#8201;nm, &#955;max&#8201;&#8776;&#8201;610&#8201;nm) under continuous near&#8208;infrared (980&#8201;nm) laser irradiation, whereas the smooth morphology suppresses this response. Importantly, this dopant&#8208;free WLE is unprecedented for polyamides, identifying diamantane&#8208;based polymers as an attractive platform for efficient, thermally robust, and cost&#8208;effective organic light&#8208;emitting materials.

Accessing new heterocyclic structural space on exposure of indigo&#8208;based substrates to carbene or carbenoid reactive intermediates is the key focus of this work. A number of unprecedented heterocyclic products have been discovered and their structures characterized. Mechanistic comment on the possible cascade processes leading to the products is also presented.

Reactions of N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethylindigo with dichlorocarbene or rhodium carbenoids have been investigated leading to the one&#8208;pot production of new, complex heterocyclic derivatives. One of these arises from an overall ring interconversion process with ring expansion to afford a novel eight&#8208;membered ring&#8208;fused benz[6,7][1,5]oxazocino[3,2&#8208;b]indol&#8208;13&#8208;one derivative. Alternatively, an overall ring construction process gives rise to an unprecedented spirocyclic 2H,4H&#8208;spiro[furo[3,2&#8208;b]indole&#8208;3,2&#8242;&#8208;indoline] system. A number of products with an embedded 6H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;a:3,4&#8208;b&#8242;]diindole core from reaction with a rhodium malonyl ester carbenoid intermediate are also reported, plus some other carbenoid&#8208;derived products. A solvent dependence is apparent with these reactions. Reaction path differences are also seen using N&#8208;methylindigo or the parent indigo as the substrate and possible mechanisms are proposed.

         <title>Nickel(II) Bromide Catalyzed Multicomponent Cyclization to Access 4&#8208;Substituted 2&#8208;Iminothiazolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of 2&#8208;iminothiazolines derived from sulfoxonium ylides is disclosed. The method overcomes current limitation of substrate scope. An array of useful functionalities is tolerated under reaction conditions.

A method is reported which allows for a three&#8208;component cyclization of sulfoxonium ylides, aryl isothiocyanates, and amines to yield 2&#8208;iminothiazolines. The method overcomes the limitation from the scope&#8208;of&#8208;substrate perspective. Success relies on the use of nickel(II) bromide, presumably acting as a Lewis acid catalyst. Investigation of substrate scopes reveals the compatibility of an array of useful functionalities.

         <title>Heavy Atom&#8208;Enhanced Photooxidation Performance of Carbazole&#8208;Substituted BODIPY Dyes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbazole&#8208;substituted halogenated BODIPY dyes exhibit enhanced intersystem crossing and singlet oxygen generation via the heavy&#8208;atom effect, enabling efficient photocatalytic oxidation of 1,5&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene to juglone.

In this study, halogenated BODIPYs (C&#8208;Br2&#8208;BDPY and C&#8208;I2&#8208;BDPY) bearing a carbazole group at the meso position are synthesized and characterized using various spectroscopic techniques. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of the C&#8208;I2&#8208;BDPY revealed that it crystallizes in a triclinic crystal system with a P&#8208;1 space group. The optical properties, singlet oxygen generation capacities, and photocatalytic activities of the BODIPY derivatives are evaluated with respect to juglone synthesis. While the nonhalogenated BODIPY (C&#8208;BDPY) exhibit negligible singlet oxygen generation (&#934;&#916;&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05), the iodinated (C&#8208;I2&#8208;BDPY) and brominated (C&#8208;Br2&#8208;BDPY) derivatives demonstrate considerably higher singlet oxygen quantum yields of 0.82 and 0.73, respectively. In the photooxidation reaction of 1,5&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) to juglone, these halogenated BODIPY compounds achieve conversion yields of 62.6% for C&#8208;Br2&#8208;BDPY and 87.8% for C&#8208;I2&#8208;BDPY within one hour. The turnover number values of the BODIPY photosensitizers show a continuous increase over time, indicating sustained product formation, whereas the turnover frequency values gradually decline, reflecting the decrease in reaction rate as the process progress. Density functional theory calculations support the experimental results by demonstrating that the presence of heavy atoms facilitates intersystem crossing and enhances the thermodynamic feasibility of the photooxidation reactions.

         <title>Ni(OAc)2 Catalyzed N&#8208;Formylation of Primary Sulfonamides Using Carbon Dioxide at Ambient Pressure</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of carbon dioxide as a formyl equivalent toward the N&#8208;formylation of primary sulfonamides has been developed. This Ni(OAc)2 catalyzed protocol employs carbon dioxide under ambient pressure and enables the formylation of aryl, heteroaryl, and alkyl sulfonamides.

A Ni(OAc)2 catalyzed N&#8208;formylation of primary sulfonamides using gaseous carbon dioxide is reported. A range of aromatic, heteroaromatic, and aliphatic sulfonamides are formylated under ambient pressure of carbon dioxide in a closed system. This redox&#8208;neutral method represents a mechanistically novel and operationally convenient method for employing carbon dioxide as a formyl equivalent.

Herein, an easy&#8208;to&#8208;access and TM&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step synthesis of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;aroyl&#8208;5&#8208;sulfonamide substituted benzo[b]furans bearing many functional groups of different electronic and steric nature using thioamides and N&#8208;tosylbenzoquinone imine at room temperature in open air is reported for the first time.

Benzofuran derivatives are core components in many biologically active natural and synthetic compounds including approved drugs. Herein, an easy&#8208;to&#8208;access and TM&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step synthesis of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;aroyl&#8208;5&#8208;sulfonamide substituted benzo[b]furans bearing many functional groups of different electronic and steric nature using thioamides (as a 2C synthon) and N&#8208;tosylbenzoquinone imine (as a CCO unit partner) at room temperature in open air is presented for the first time. The reaction proceeds via deprotonation/Michael addition/cyclization/aromatization cascades forming two new (C&#63743;C and C&#63743;O) bonds and one ring, liberating only H2S as a byproduct. High resolution mass spectrometry study endorses the key intermediates involved during reaction, validating excellent regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity. This protocol will not only provide an efficient and scalable method to access diverse benzo[b]furans that could be adaptable to late&#8208;stage functionalization but also enrich the research domain of thioamides.

         <title>Activation in Organic and Macromolecular Including Peptide Synthesis by Fluorinated Carboxylic Acids and Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept paper highlights the importance and the historical developments of activated carboxylic acids in organic, macromolecular, bioorthogonal, and peptide synthesis. It dicusses the use of activated ester, including fluorinated activated ester and other activated carboxylic acid derivatives. The reactivity of various classes of activated carboylic acid derivatives obtained by fluorinated is discussed by employing aminolysis and transesterification reactions.

This concept article discusses recent developments in activated esters, including fluorinated activated esters and other activated carboxylic acid derivatives. Activated carboxylic acid derivatives, including esters, are of interest since 1901 when Emil Fischer prepared the first peptide, and soon after, for the synthesis of Nylons, Kevlar, and other condensation polymers. Since the synthesis of sequence&#8208;defined peptides and methodologies for their construction relied mostly on the development of activated ester derivatives, the preparation of the peptide and amide bond is used as a strategy for the organization and the development of this concept article. Therefore, the acyl chlorides, anhydrides, numerous nonfluorinated activated esters, and fluorinated activated esters, including pentachlorophenyl, pentafluorophenyl, hexafluoroisopropyl, and other fluorinated esters, will be discussed in aminolysis and transesterification reactions. The synthesis of peptide and amide bond, the modification of polymers, the bioorthogonal chemistry, and the living chain&#8208;growth condensation polymerization are also briefly discussed. This concept article ends with a brief mention of the resurgence of acyl fluoride in organic and macromolecular chemistry.

         <title>All&#8208;Visible&#8208;Light Diarylethene Photoswitches and Control over Dynamic Conjugate Addition Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoswitches by fusing &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl motif with dithienylethene (DTE) scaffold. The photoswitches exhibit reversible photochromic behavior under visible&#8208;light, with enhanced efficiency through electronic modulation. Moreover, DTEs enable visible&#8208;light&#8208;controlled C&#63743;S bond formation and cleavage, providing a platform for recyclable and biocompatible materials.

All&#8208;visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoswitches are gaining significant attention for their environmental friendliness and biocompatibility. Here, a series of visible&#8208;light responsive photoswitches is presented by embedding &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl motifs into the ethene bridge of dithienylethene (DTE) scaffolds. Through electronic modulation and &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension, the absorption is redshifted into the visible range, enabling reversible photochromic ring&#8208;closure and ring&#8208;opening under blue and red light, respectively. Density functional theory calculations reveal that electron&#8208;withdrawing groups and extended conjugation narrow the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, enhancing photoswitching efficiency. Furthermore, these photoswitches also function as dynamic Michael acceptors, allowing visible&#8208;light&#8208;controlled C&#63743;S bond formation and cleavage with great reversibility. The work described offers a versatile platform for visible&#8208;light&#8208;regulated dynamic covalent chemistry and paves the way for the development of recyclable, biocompatible materials.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of Imino Lactones with Ylidene&#8208;Pyrazolones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction of imino lactones with ylidene&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones is catalyzed effectively by Cu(MeCN)4BF4/Fesulphos to give spiropyrazolones in good yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. A wide range of substrates is successfully applied, and spiropyrazolones bearing various substituents are obtained under the optimized conditions.

A Cu(MeCN)4BF4/Fesulphos complex successfully catalyzes the asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition (1,3&#8208;DC) of imino lactones with 4&#8208;ylidene&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones to afford bis&#8208;spirocyclic pyrrolidines in good yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr, 99% ee). In addition, exo'&#8208;(2,5&#8208;trans&#8208;4,5&#8208;trans)&#8208;pyrrolidine scaffolds are exclusively produced as single diastereomers. A wide variety of imino lactones bearing electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the phenyl groups and heteroaryl substrates is employed in this reaction. The substrate scope of ylidene&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones is investigated, and the substituents on the phenyl ring have limited effect on the product yields and stereoselectivity of the reaction.

         <title>Exploring the Regioselectivity of Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions of 2,6&#8208;Disubstituted Benzoquinones through DFT Calculations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of 19 substituents on the regioselectivity of Diels&#8211;Alder reactions is explored by quantum chemistry. Experimentally observed product distributions are compared favorably with calculated reaction barrier trends. Unlike interaction energies, the deformation energies corresponding to the two regioisomers differ significantly and follow the same trend as experimental product ratios.

Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;6&#8208;substituted&#8208;p&#8208;benzoquinones are studied using quantum chemical calculations. The effect of 19 substituents, including halomethyl, alkyl, vinyl, ethynyl, nitrile, trifluoromethyl, methoxy, cyclohexenyl, phenyl, and trifluoromethoxyphenyl groups, on the reaction barriers is explored by the B3LYP&#8208;D3, M06&#8208;2X, and DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T) methods. Gibbs free activation energies are compared for the two regioisomeric products experimentally observed in the reaction mixture. For 75% of the substituents, the calculated barrier difference (&#916;G&#8225;b &#8211; &#916;G&#8225;a) lies within 2.0&#8201;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 of the value determined from the experimentally observed product ratio a/b. Activation barriers are further analyzed in terms of the underlying deformation and interaction energies. The difference in deformation energies of transition states corresponding to the two regioisomers ranges from &#8722;8.0 to +8.0&#8201;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and is directly proportional to experimental ln(a/b) values. Differences in interaction energies between regioisomeric transition states are, in comparison, significantly smaller.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Promoted Aerobic Oxidation of Boronic Acids and Esters Utilizing a Benzothioxanthene Imide as the Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical aerobic oxidation protocol using a benzothioxanthene imide as the photocatalyst at a low catalyst loading (0.01&#8201;mol%) is developed for the oxidation of boronic acids and esters.

Herein, a sustainable and eco&#8208;friendly protocol is reported for the aerobic photochemical oxidation of boronic acids or esters, utilizing a dibenzothioxanthene imide as the photocatalyst at a very low catalyst loading (0.01%) in 2&#8208;propanol, employing a 456&#8201;nm irradiation source. Additionally, this protocol is successfully applied to a variety of substrates.

         <title>Environmental Control of Regio&#8208;/Stereoselectivity Across Mechanistically Similar Transformations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lewis Acid (LA) catalysis offers a unifying strategy to tune nucleophilic additions. By modulating electrophile activation, LAs shift regioselectivity in epoxide openings and diastereoselectivity in carbonyl additions by 43&#8211;76%. Strong LAs (e.g., AlCl3, SnCl4) amplify subtle bond or face differences, enabling predictable, high&#8208;impact control across mechanistically related transformations.

The control of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity in organic transformations remains a foundational challenge in synthetic chemistry. While chemoselectivity can often be influenced by careful selection of reagents or protective groups, controlling regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity is far more nuanced, often requiring highly specific reaction conditions. In this work, a unified approach for controlling both regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity across mechanistically related transformations is explored, specifically focusing on epoxide openings and carbonyl additions. It is demonstrated that the same environmental factors, here the nature of the Lewis acid (LA), can be leveraged to influence divergent outcomes in these two reaction types by amplifying inherent differences between reaction sites/faces, leading to highly selective transformations. The systematic evaluation of over 30 Lewis acids revealed a dichotomy between &#8220;labile&#8221; and &#8220;strong&#8221; activation modes, where strong LAs, such as AlCl3 and SnCl4, drive the highest levels of regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity for both transformations. Further, there exists nuanced differences between the degree of influence of some LA within these mechanistically related transformations. These findings suggest that environmental factors can be broadly applied across different mechanistic classes to achieve selectivity, offering a versatile strategy for reaction optimization.

         <title>Synthesis and Photophysical Analysis of Amphiphilic Azobenzene Surfactants for Photomechanical Actuation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Subtle electronic modifications of tailored amphiphilic azobenzene derivatives exhibit distinct cis&#8208;state half&#8208;lives despite similar activation barriers. The structural functionalization enables the molecules to be soluble in water and organic solvents, making them photomechanical surfactants with different behavior in oil&#8208;in&#8208;water versus water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions.

Photoswitchable amphiphiles are promising candidates for investigating light&#8208;responsive mechanical behavior in soft and biological systems, with potential applications in dynamic materials and adaptive interfaces. Azobenzene is the most studied photoactuator, but research typically focuses on its standard backbone, limiting control over its photophysical and kinetic properties. Modifying its conjugated core offers new opportunities for tuning its behavior. Here, the synthesis and characterization of water&#8208;soluble azobenzene derivatives featuring a hexaethylene glycol (OCH2CH2)6 unit terminated with a sodium sulfate (O&#63743;SO3Na) group, alongside subtle electronic modifications to the conjugated backbone, are reported. Their steady&#8208;state photophysical properties and reversible photoisomerization kinetics in aqueous environments under real&#8208;time observation are demonstrated. Despite similar activation parameters for the thermal cis&#8211;trans isomerization in some derivatives, their half&#8208;lives vary significantly, underscoring the overlooked role of the transmission coefficient in isomerization kinetics. Finally, these photo&#8208;responsive amphiphiles are showcased as dynamic surfactants in oil&#8208;in&#8208;water and water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions, visualizing their behavior through operando microscopy. These findings underscore their potential for tunable emulsions and adaptive soft matter applications.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross Coupling of N&#8208;Alkenyl Heterocycles and Aryl Sulfonium Salts: Expedient Access to N&#8208;Benzyl Heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of a site&#8208;selective C&#63743;H dibenzothiophenation with nickel&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) cross coupling reaction is developed, offering an orthogonal protocol to traditional SN2 and C&#63743;N coupling methods to bioactive N&#8208;benzylic heterocycles. The mild conditions and good functional&#8208;group compatibility permit the rapid construction of molecular complexity and late&#8208;stage functionalization of arenes.

A nickel&#8208;catalyzed system is developed that enables the coupling between aryldibenzothiophenium salts and N&#8208;alkenyl heterocycles. Traditionally, medicinally relevant N&#8208;benzylic heterocycles are constructed via harsh substitution conditions between the N&#8208;H heterocycle and a benzyl electrophile in the presence of strong bases. The C&#63743;C cross coupling strategy presents attractive potential for the synthesis of these important scaffolds, e.g., carboetomidate. Herein, it is documented that the combination of a site&#8208;selective C&#63743;H dibenzothiophenation with a nickel&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) cross coupling grants access to a diverse range of synthetically useful N&#8208;benzylic heterocycles, i.e., alkylated arenes. In particular, the mild conditions and good functional group compatibility permit the rapid assembly of molecular complexity and late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive compounds, such as clofibrate, fenofibrate, and fenbufen, thus providing an orthogonal protocol to existing SN2 and C&#63743;N coupling approaches.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Four&#8208;Component Radical Carbonylation Reaction for the Construction of Benzofuranamide Derivativesitle</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of fluoroalkylated and carbonylated benzofuran derivatives are efficiently prepared by a multicomponent free&#8208;radical strategy involving the migration of a double bond and the insertion of a carbonyl group. The domino process avoids the preparation of precursors in the multistep reaction by accurately controlling the addition order between components and uses cheap and readily available raw materials.

A novel palladium&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component radical tandem cyclization&#8208;carbonylation of 1,6&#8208;enynes with aniline, carbon monoxide, and ethyl difluoroiodoacetate is reported. This approach facilitates a multicomponent reaction involving tandem 1,2&#8208;double bond migration, thereby allowing the efficient synthesis of alkylamide&#8208;substituted benzofuranamide derivatives. The proposed strategy demonstrates a broad substrate scope, high efficiency in bond migratory&#8208;rearrangement, and controllable selectivity in the order of component addition.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Acyl Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling from Carboxylic Acids In&#8201;Situ Activated by HATU: An Efficient Way to Ketones Laid by Nitrogen Coordination</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed acyl Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reaction between carboxylic acids and organoboronic acids is developed by using HATU as the in&#8201;situ activator, which provided a mild and versatile method for ketones synthesis. Experimental and density functional theory&#8208;computation studies disclosed the detailed role of the nitrogen&#8208;atom and the likely pathways.

A palladium&#8208;catalyzed acyl Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling between carboxylic acids and organoboronic acids has been developed, employing hexafluorophosphate azabenzotriazole tetramethyl uronium as an in situ activator. Using Pd2(dba)3/PCy3 as the catalyst and K2CO3 as the base, the reaction accommodates a broad range of both aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids. Controlled experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the pyridine nitrogen plays a critical role in the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Influence of Levulinoyl Protecting Groups on Glycosylation Stereoselectivity and Glycosyl Cation Structure</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of levulinoyl protecting groups on the glycosylation stereoselectivity and glycosyl cation structure is studied for galactose and mannose building blocks.

The stereoselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;cis glycosidic bonds is historically challenging, and a common synthetic approach is based on the participation of remote protecting ester groups. Common intermediates of glycosylation reactions are glycosyl cations, whose structures are difficult to characterize. Here, the glycosylation reactions and structure of the glycosyl cations of galactose and mannose are investigated when protected with levulinic acid (Lev) at C4 and/or C6, respectively. The glycosyl cations can be assigned to rearranged structures as a consequence of ring opening, as well as dioxolenium ions that suggest remote participation. Some evidence for the long&#8208;range interaction of the Lev keto group is found as previously proposed, which could explain unusual solution&#8208;phase stereoselectivities observed.

         <title>Fast Nucleophilic Approach to Exhaustively Substituted Porphyrin Derivatives at the &#8220;Eastern Half&#8221;</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;step procedure including the nitration of simple porphyrinates (Zn2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+ complexes) and very attractive vicarious nucleophilic substitution of hydrogen reaction gives porphyrin derivatives with unique structures, exhaustively &#946;&#8208;substituted in the so&#8208;called &#8220;Eastern half.&#8221; These types of hydrophilic or amphiphilic target products are sought in anticancer photodynamic therapy. It seems they are practically unavailable by any other alternative methods.

meso&#8208;Tetraarylporphyrin chelates (of Zn2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+) are easily available from parent porphyrins. Their reactions with nitric acid (yellow fuming HNO3, d&#8201;=&#8201;1.52, diluted to 25%&#8211;50%), under optimized conditions in CHCl3 at room temperature, can be carried out selectively, thus giving mainly &#946;,&#946;&#8208;dinitro&#8208;substituted moieties (usually two or three isomers of the above complexes). These intermediates (obtained in overall yields of up to 73%), upon the reaction with carbanions bearing a leaving group X at the reactive center, afford the target products, the ones of vicarious nucleophilic substitution (VNS) of hydrogen. This approach allows the synthesis of porphyrin derivatives exhaustively &#946;&#8208;substituted in the so&#8208;called &#8220;Eastern half&#8221;, starting from a simple meso&#8208;tetraarylporphyrins. These types of products are sought in anticancer photodynamic therapy (PDT). Thus, the above two&#8208;step procedure including very attractive VNS reaction gives hydrophilic or amphiphilic moieties that seem to be potential PDT agents with unique structures, being practically unavailable by any other alternative methods.

         <title>1,3&#8208;Diazetidin&#8208;2&#8208;Ones: Synthetic Approaches and Therapeutic Promise within the Aza&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Lactam Family</title>

         <dc:description>
This review explores the synthesis, reactivity, and therapeutic potential of 1,3&#8208;diazetidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones&#8212;an underexplored class of aza&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams. Emphasis is placed on synthetic challenges, emerging methodologies, and their promise as &#946;&#8208;lactamase&#8208;resistant scaffolds in medicinal chemistry.

1,3&#8208;diazetidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones, overlooked members of the aza&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactam family, are structurally distinct four&#8208;membered nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles with strong potential in medicinal chemistry, particularly as &#946;&#8208;lactamase inhibitors and antibiotic analogues. This review provides a comprehensive overview of their synthesis, structural diversity, and biological significance. The most established synthetic method is the [2&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition between C&#63742;N nucleophiles and isocyanates, though this approach is highly substrate dependent and frequently leads to side products or cycloreversion. Alternative strategies&#8212;including photochemical and organometallic methodologies&#8212;have been explored but remain limited in scope. As a result, access to 1,3&#8208;diazetidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones is significantly constrained, impeding wider investigation and application. In&#8201;silico studies suggest favorable stability and reactivity profiles and indicate these compounds could circumvent &#946;&#8208;lactam resistance through hydrolysis&#8208;resistant enzyme intermediates. Several derivatives have demonstrated promising antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, and anticancer activities. Nevertheless, further synthetic innovation is essential to fully realize the therapeutic potential of this underexplored class of heterocycles.

         <title>Exploring the Chemical Reactivity of Triisopropylsilyl Dialkynylmethanol for the Synthesis of Dialkynylcarbinol&#8208;Related Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relevance of 1&#8208;(triisopropylsilyl)penta&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;ol as a versatile C5 organic framework is highlighted in both racemic and enantiopure form thanks to a finely optimized lipase&#8208;mediated enzymatic kinetic resolution procedure. This straightforward approach, exploiting the reactivity of the terminal alkyne group, opened the way for the most cytotoxic series to date of bioinspired lipidic alkynylcarbinols.

Prompted by the pharmacological relevance of lipidic alkynylcarbinols, 1&#8208;(triisopropylsilyl)penta&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;ol is exploited as a versatile C5 organic framework. Selective functionalization of this dissymmetrical dialkynylcarbinol precursor is achieved via the creation of either a Csp&#8211;Csp (alkyne), a Csp&#8211;Csp2 (alkene and aryl), or a Csp&#8211;Csp3 (RCHOH) bond. A novel series of racemic HSD17B11&#8208;bioactivated procytotoxic acetylenic lipids is accessed that revealed, amongst the most potent to date, with IC50 down to 27&#8201;nM on osteosarcoma U2OS cells. Click&#8208;type 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions, such as a copper&#8208;catalyzed reaction with a long&#8208;chain alkyl azide (CuAAC) and a base&#8208;promoted reaction with a lipidic nitrile oxide, are first described in a racemic version. Preparation of both enantiomers of 1&#8208;(triisopropylsilyl)penta&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;ol through kinetic enzymatic resolution with CAL&#8208;B immobilized on acrylic resin is carefully optimized. Finally, the use of resolved samples in 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions leads to the enantioenriched cycloadducts without significant epimerization of the carbinol center.

         <title>An Improved Synthesis of Ionizable Lipids D&#8208;Lin&#8208;KC2&#8208;DMA and D&#8208;Lin&#8208;MC3&#8208;DMA</title>

         <dc:description>
A new route to ionizable lipid KC2 through the double alkylation of TosMIC with linoleyl tosylate avoids problematic reactions, is higher yielding, and requires three fewer steps. Lipid MC3 is also more efficiently prepared by the new method.

Considerable interest exists in ionizable lipids (ILs) for the delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics. While not a component of a yet&#8208;approved medication, lipid KC2 is especially competent for the delivery of plasmid DNA, consequently it is in high demand on the part of research laboratories worldwide. Lipid MC3, a component of Onpattro, is a benchmark against which the efficacy of new ILs is evaluated. A new route to KC2 and MC3 through the double alkylation of TosMIC with linoleyl tosylate is described. The new synthesis avoids problematic reactions, proceeds in higher overall yield relative to the literature one, and in the case of KC2, involves three fewer steps.

         <title>Photoinduced Reduction and Deuteration of Aryl Halides with NHC&#8208;Boranes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced radical reduction and deuteration of aryliodides and arylbromides is achieved using NHC&#8208;borane without external initiators or photoredox catalysts. The reaction proceeds via aryl radicals and tolerates a broad range of functional groups, offering a practical and versatile approach for dehalogenation and isotopic labeling.

Herein, an operationally simple photoinduced radical reduction of aryliodides and arylbromides using NHC&#8208;borane as a reductant, without external radical initiator or photoredox catalyst, is reported. Mechanistic investigations indicate the key formation of an aryl radical, which undergoes facile reduction by NHC&#8208;borane. The method demonstrates compatibility with a broad range of functional groups, providing a valuable tool for synthesis and isotopic labeling.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Directed Sulfinylation of Distal C(sp3)&#63743;H Bonds by Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox/copper&#8208;cocatalyzed remote C&#63743;H sulfoxidation reaction is described that proceeds through radical&#8208;mediated 1,5&#8722;hydrogen atom transfer. A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction between N&#8722;alkoxypyridinium salts and sodium arylsulfinates gave a series of hydroxy sulfoxide derivatives. This transformation features redox&#8208;neutral conditions, broad functional group compatibility, and excellent site selectivity.

An efficient photoredox&#8208;catalyzed reaction is reported for site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#63743;H sulfoxidation of N&#8208;alkoxypyridinium salts using sodium arylsulfinates as sulfinyl donors. This transformation involves alkoxy&#8208;radical&#8208;directed 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (1,5&#8722;HAT) followed by C(sp3)&#63743;S bond formation. A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven, copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling strategy enables the synthesis of a series of hydroxyl sulfoxide derivatives.

         <title>Rapid Mechanochemical Synthesis of Azosulfones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid synthesis of azosulfones can be accomplished in a vibrational mechanical mill, giving up to quantitative yields in as little as 30&#8201;min. The tolerance of the method is demonstrates on a broad substrate scope and is successfully used to produce 30 different products. Spectroscopic and computational studies provide insight into the process and its selectivity.

Azosulfones represent a potent and stable surrogate for diazonium salts. Their wide application in C&#8211;H functionalizations catalyzed by transition metals and visible light is well&#8208;known in organic chemistry. Here, a single&#8208;step mechanochemical synthesis of azosulfones is reported, starting from readily available precursors, which has high conversion efficacy &#8722;80%&#8211;99% isolated yields are obtained in most cases. A substrate scope of 30 different compounds is obtained. This method requires no solvent, it is quick and has potential in terms of scalability and tolerance toward a broad range of functional groups, which makes it attractive for synthesis. Spectroscopic and computational studies are performed to explain the observed reactivity patterns.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Induced the Radical Cascade Cyclization of 2&#8208;Isocyanobiaryls via 1,2&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenanthridines, as important structural moieties of many naturally occurring products, pharmaceuticals, and functionalized polycyclic heteroarenes, have attracted considerable attention among chemists due to their significant potentials in pharmaceutical and material chemistry. Herein, a visible light&#8208;induced radical cascade cyclization of 2&#8208;isocyanobiaryls via 1,2&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer is described to rapidly synthesize phenanthridines under mild conditions. 

Phenanthridines, as important structural moieties of many naturally occurring products, pharmaceuticals, and functionalized polycyclic heteroarenes, have attracted considerable attention among chemists due to their significant potential in pharmaceutical and material chemistry. The hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process provides an important strategy for selective C&#63743;H functionalization. However, net 1,2&#8208;HAT processes have been reported and applied infrequently compared to the popularity of 1,5&#8208;HAT processes. Herein, a visible light&#8208;induced radical cascade cyclization of 2&#8208;isocyanobiaryls via 1,2&#8208;HAT is described to rapidly synthesize phenanthridines under mild conditions. This approach represents an example of radical cascade cyclization of 2&#8208;isocyanobiaryls via infrequent 1,2&#8208;HAT to access the phenanthridine core. This protocol features a 1,2&#8208;HAT, a radical cascade process, broad substrate scope, and good functional group compatibility under mild and oxidant&#8208;free reaction conditions.

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Aminomethyl&#8208;5R&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;Triazoles by Cyclization of Amidrazones: Multigram Approach and Revised Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of 3&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;5R&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoles from acyl hydrazides and methyl phthalimidoacetimidate is proposed. The reaction conditions are optimized to control the cyclization pathway, minimizing the formation of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole by&#8208;products. The intramolecular cyclization mechanism of amidrazones is discussed on the basis of quantum chemical calculations.

A series of 3&#8208;(aminomethyl)&#8208;5R&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoles is synthesized in gram&#8208;scale quantities starting from N&#8208;(cyanomethyl)phthalimide and carboxylic acid hydrazides. The intramolecular cyclization of amidrazones to give 1,2,4&#8208;triazolines is the key step. The main side products are 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazoles formed by a concurrent intramolecular condensation. Their amount depends on the steric and electronic nature of the substituent in the initial carboxylic acid hydrazide. Additionally, aminomethyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole is modified by the introduction of different substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4 of the heterocyclic scaffold. Quantum chemical calculations demonstrate a fine balance of activation energy values for the key stages in the formation of the two isomeric products. In contrast to the previously derived mechanism, the participation of water, not ammonia, is required as a&#8201;factor reducing the activation barriers for both reaction pathways.

         <title>Synthesis of Bis&#8208;Arylated Squaryls via Addition of Organocopper Species onto Squaryl Dichlorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple protocol for the iterative and selective introduction of diverse substituents relayed through organocopper chemistry has been developed, providing access to sophisticated bis&#8208;functionalized squaryl scaffolds. This provides a unified approach to access four&#8208;membered rings possessing useful functional handles.

Squaric chlorides serve as convenient, readily available building blocks in the synthetic path toward unsymmetrically substituted squaryls.

&lt;p&gt;A simple protocol for the iterative and selective introduction of diverse substituents relayed through organocopper chemistry has been developed, providing access to sophisticated bis-functionalized squaryl scaffolds. This provides a unified approach to access four-membered rings possessing useful functional handles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Squaric chlorides serve as convenient, readily available building blocks in the synthetic path toward unsymmetrically substituted squaryls. The use of in&#8201;situ generated arylcopper reagents enables precise, selective control over stoichiometry and facilitates the creation of a diverse library of sophisticated structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Base&#8208;mediated diastereoselective metal&#8208;free, double Michael [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] annulation reaction of p&#8208;quinone methides with alkylidene pyrazolones, isatin&#8208;derived N&#8208;Boc ketimine, and isatylidine malonitrile has been developed.

A metal&#8208;free, base&#8208;catalyzed double Michael diastereoselective [4&#8201;+&#8201;2] annulation reaction of para&#8208;quinone methides with alkylidene pyrazolones and isatin&#8208;derived N&#8208;Boc ketimines or isatylidine malonitriles has been developed, leading to biologically inspired spiro&#8208;heterocyclic derivatives under mild reaction conditions in a short reaction time.

Selective C&#63743;F Bond Activation in 1,1&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes: Synthesis of Functionalized Monofluoroalkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treatment of 2&#8208;aryloxy&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes with Me2AlCl promotes fluoride abstraction, followed by cyclopropane ring opening, to generate &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated oxocarbenium ions. These cations are trapped with nucleophiles such as arenes and silyl enol ethers to provide functionalized 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1&#8208;alkenes. The instability of vinyl cations prevents further fluoride abstraction, resulting in completely selective C&#63743;F bond activation.

Functionalized monofluoroalkenes (3&#8208;arylated and 5&#8208;oxygenated 1&#8208;aryloxy&#8208;2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1&#8208;alkenes) are synthesized via selective activation of the C&#63743;F bonds in 2&#8208;aryloxy&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes that are readily prepared from aryl vinyl ethers. Treatment of these difluorocyclopropanes with Me2AlCl promotes fluoride abstraction followed by cyclopropane ring opening to generate &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated oxocarbenium ions. These cations are subsequently trapped with nucleophiles, such as arenes and silyl enol ethers (Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208; and aldol&#8208;type reactions), to provide functionalized 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1&#8208;alkenes. Because of the instability of vinyl cations, further fluoride abstraction is suppressed, resulting in completely selective C&#63743;F bond activation.

A nickel&#8208;catalyzed carboalkoxylation and borylalkoxylation of the biphenylene C&#63743;C &#963;&#8208;bond has been developed to form the corresponding ring&#8208;opening oxygenative difunctionalization products. The key to success is the use of acetal&#8208;based, electron&#8208;deficient peroxides, which enable the otherwise challenging C&#63743;O cross coupling with nickel catalysts even under photo&#8208;free, thermal reaction conditions.

         <title>Exploration of Structure&#8211;Property Relationships by Altering Glycol Backbone Unsaturation (Double/Triple Bonds) in Furan&#8208;Based Polyesters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores how adding unsaturated groups to bio&#8208;based furanic polyesters can change their stiffness and heat resistance. While this offers new possibilities, it also needs careful control during production. It is shown that solution polycondensation works well for making these materials and offers a path toward more flexible, stable, and ecofriendly polymers.

This study highlights both the challenges and opportunities associated with developing bio&#8208;based furanic polyesters. Incorporating unsaturated moieties into glycol chains effectively modulates polymer rigidity and thermal properties, though it requires careful optimization of polymerization conditions. The findings demonstrate the viability of solution polycondensation for synthesizing high&#8208;quality FDCA&#8208;based polyesters with unsaturated glycols and pave the way for further investigations into polymer design strategies that balance flexibility, thermal stability, and environmental sustainability.

The efficiency of the concise catalytic process is demonstrated by the short-step synthesis of the bisnorlignan natural product pachypostaudin A.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Elucidating the Mechanism and Origin of Site Selectivity in the Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#63743;H Functionalization of a Thioamide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The detailed reaction mechanism of the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#63743;H activation/amidation of a thioamide has been extensively investigated using density functional theory methods. The origin of site selectivity in the C(sp3)&#63743;H activation step is elucidated through structural analysis.

In the present study, the mechanism of cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#63743;H activation/amidation reaction of thioamide has been investigated using density functional theory. The computational results indicate that the activation of the primary C(sp3)&#63743;H bond is more energetically favorable than the secondary C(sp3)&#63743;H bond. The formation of a five&#8208;membered cobaltacycle is the key intermediate for the amidation reaction with dioxazolone. Based on the calculations, the amidation reaction of cobaltacycle intermediate proceeds through the sequential stepwise decarboxylation, migratory insertion, and proto&#8208;demetalation processes. The extended transition state&#8208;natural orbitals for chemical valence analysis verify that the primary C(sp3)&#63743;H activation occurs predominantly due to the stronger interfragment interaction.

A cationic complex, [(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)RuLCl]+[PF6]&#8722;(1) {L&#8201;=&#8201;di(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)amine}, has been synthesized from the reaction of [(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)RuCl2]2 with di(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)amine in acetonitrile. The complex has been characterized by 1H and13C nuclear magnetic resonance&#160;spectroscopy and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. Additionally, the complex has been structurally characterized. This complex has been used as a homogeneous catalyst for the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones with benzylic alcohols as an alkylating agent in toluene at 120&#8201;&#176;C in the presence of Cs2CO3. The scope of the reaction extends to the synthesis of a fluorescent &#945;&#8208;alkylated product. Mechanistic insights suggest that the water molecule generated in&#8201;situ during the aldol condensation facilitates the reactivation of the catalytic species, thereby sustaining the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Sustainable Electrochemical Access to &#945;&#8208;Thiocyanate Ketones: A Metal&#8208;Free Protocol Utilizing Ammonium Thiocyanate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utilization of ammonium thiocyanate has been developed for the electrosynthesis of &#945;&#8208;thiocyanate ketones under environmental&#8208;friendly conditions, addressing limitations of conventional oxidative methods.

A robust and environmentally benign electrochemical method for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;thiocyanate ketones from aromatic ketones is reported. The protocol utilizes ammonium thiocyanate as both the thiocyanate source and supporting electrolyte in an undivided cell with platinum electrodes and an acetonitrile/water/sulfuric acid solvent system. This metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free transformation proceeds under mild conditions, exhibiting broad substrate scope, excellent functional group compatibility, and amenability to gram&#8208;scale operations. The developed approach offers a sustainable and practical alternative for accessing these valuable thiocyanated carbonyl compounds, addressing limitations of conventional oxidative methods.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Alkynylthiolation of Tertiary &#945;&#8208;Carbonyl Bromides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free alkynylthiolation of tertiary &#945;&#8208;carbonyl bromides with 1,2,3&#8208;thiadiazoles. Those reactions involve the in&#8208;situ generation of alkynylthiolate anions from 1,2,3&#8208;thiadiazoles in the presence of a base and then their halogenophilic nucleophilic substitution (SN2X) reactions. The exceptionally mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance highlight the utility of this method to prepare privileged motifs from readily available 1,2,3&#8208;thiadiazoles and tertiary &#945;&#8208;carbonyl bromides feedstocks. Gram&#8208;scale reaction and diverse synthetic transformations convincingly demonstrate the synthetic potential of this method.</dc:description>
