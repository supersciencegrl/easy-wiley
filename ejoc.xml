         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Multisubstituted Allenes via Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of Propargylic Acetates with Chlorohydrosilanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reductive cross&#8208;coupling of propargylic acetates and chlorohydrosilanes using nickel catalysts has been reported to produce a series of silyl&#8208;substituted allenes with high regioselectivity.







Abstract
This paper introduces an innovative strategy for the synthesis of multisubstituted allenes via nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The approach utilizes propargyl acetates and chlorosilanes to produce a variety of silyl&#8208;substituted allenes. The reaction conditions are notably mild, and the process is characterized by high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, as well as an impressive substrate scope. Furthermore, the method can be readily extended to the use of chlorogermane and chlorostannane, facilitating the synthesis of germanium or stannium&#8208;substituted allenes. This research not only offers a valuable strategy for the preparation of multisubstituted allenes but also significantly broadens the synthetic repertoire for the construction of highly functionalized molecules.

         <title>A Green Synthetic Approach to Construct C2&#8208;Quaternary Indolin&#8208;3&#8208;Ones at Room Temperature via Regioselective Oxidative Dearomatization of Indoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we have developed a novel and simple synthetic approach for producing diverse indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one using oxidant TBHP and In(OTf)3 catalyst at ambient temperature under solvent&#8208;free conditions, exhibiting regioselectivity and excellent functional group tolerance.







Abstract
A new synthetic strategy for the construction of C2&#8208;quaternary indole for the formation of Indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones has been explored via indium(III) trifluoromethansulphonate catalyst at room temperature with TBHP as a green oxidant in water. This approach for the oxidative dearomatization process allows for the production of the natural product Halichrome A and a broad range of C2&#8208;arylated Indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones under a milder condition in very good yields. The oxidative self&#8208;dimerization and self&#8208;trimerization of various indole derivatives have also been achieved under the same conditions.

         <title>Harnessing Oxoammonium Salts for Oxidations in Organic Synthesis and Catalysis: Origins and Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 47, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As efficient organic oxidant, oxoammonium salts have been applied in many reactions. Focusing on recent publications, this concept discusses these reactions from the mechanistic perspective, and summarized four types of reaction route at the oxoammonium cation.







Abstract
The oxoammonium cation has been identified as the true oxidant intermediate in many aerobic oxidations promoted by long&#8208;lived nitroxide radicals. Various oxoammonium salts have been synthesized and utilized to perform these oxidation reactions. In addition to alcohol dehydrogenation and oxidative coupling reactions, new types of reactions involving oxoammonium salts have recently been reported. This concept aims to discuss these oxidations from the perspective of reaction mechanisms, with a focus on progress made since 2019. Beyond the electron transfer route for synthesizing oxoammonium salts, four types of reaction mechanisms are included.

         <title>Computation&#8208;Guided Scope Exploration of a Conjugate Addition/Truce&#8208;Smiles Cascade Reaction for Scaffold Diversification</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 47, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explored variations of a conjugate addition/Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement/elimination cascade reaction that proceeds through spiro, bridged, or alternatively fused intermediates. None of these cascade substrates was found to undergo the desired cascade reaction. DFT calculations revealed that the Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement is the rate&#8208;limiting step for these processes. Based on these findings, we designed an alternative substrate that does undergo the cascade reaction, albeit with a different outcome.







Abstract
Based on the successful application of a nitroaryl transfer cascade reaction in the total synthesis of various monoterpene indole alkaloids proceeding via fused bicyclic intermediate, we investigated analogous cascade reactions involving spiro, bridged, and alternatively fused bicyclic intermediates. Unfortunately, none of these was found to afford the desired nitroaryl transfer product. DFT studies of the original cascade process revealed that the Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement is the rate&#8208;determining step. In addition, we found that the subsequent SO2 extrusion is accompanied by retro&#8208;Mannich ring opening, resulting in a stabilized enolate that only recyclizes after activation of the cyclic imine moiety. Computation of the reaction profiles of the proposed alternative cascade reactions showed that the barrier for the Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement is unreasonably high for the bridged and alternatively fused systems, but only moderately higher for the five&#8208;membered spiro system. Reasoning that even more electron&#8208;deficient arenesulfonamides should have a lower barrier for the Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement, we synthesized the corresponding 2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzenesulfonamide precursor and found that it indeed smoothly undergoes the nitroaryl transfer cascade at room temperature. In this case, however, the cascade reaction produces a cyclic imine product, as the intermediate 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenyl&#8208;substituted enolate is insufficiently nucleophilic to undergo the Mannich cyclization.

         <title>Diazo&#8208;Based Construction of Heterocyclic Systems Via a X&#8722;H Insertion/Cyclization Cascade</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 47, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept outlines an X&#8722;H insertion/cyclization cascade (X=heteroatom), a prominent strategy for the assembly of N,O,S&#8208;heterocycles from diazo compounds and X&#8722;H&#8208;tethered precursors. While focusing on the cyclization via an addition to multiple bonds, we have highlighted Michael&#8208;type and Conia&#8208;ene reactions, aldol condensation, and Mannich reaction as prevalent ring&#8208;closing modes.







Abstract
The X&#8722;H insertion reaction (X=heteroatom) of diazo compounds has emerged as an eminent and reliant approach for the construction of C&#8722;X bonds. By merging X&#8722;H insertion with the sequential ring&#8208;closing transformations, diverse heterocyclic systems can be obtained in a step&#8208;economical manner. In recent years, the X&#8722;H insertion/cyclization cascades and one&#8208;pot transformations attract more research attention, especially in the area of asymmetric synthesis. Concentrating on the assembly of N,O,S&#8208;heterocycles, this Concept elucidates the various combinations of X&#8722;H insertion reactions with cyclization via an addition to multiple bonds. The ring&#8208;forming strategies reviewed comprise of Michael&#8208;type and Conia&#8208;ene reactions, aldol condensation, and Mannich reaction.

         <title>Trivalent Heteroglycoclusters as Focal Point Pseudoenantiomers: Synthesis and Preliminary Biological Evaluation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 47, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of heteroglycocluster mirror images: Heterotrivalent cluster glycosides featuring three disctinct sugar ligands were prepared by the effective sequential glycosylation of a scaffold molecule incorporating an asymmetric focal point. Intermediate diastereomers were separated and one stereoisomer crystallized. The effect of relative glycoligand orientation was preliminarily assed in lectin binding assays.







Abstract
We describe the synthesis of the first heteroglycoclusters featuring three distinct carbohydrate ligands. The obtained pair of stereoisomeric glycoclusters were named &#8220;focal point enantiomers&#8221;, as the configuration of the focal point is the only varying stereogenic element in these molecules. The first pair of such diastereomeric heteroglycoclusters was accessible by an efficient sequence of protection and sequential glycosylation steps utilizing a mannosyl, a N&#8208;acetylglucosaminyl, and a galactosyl donor, respectively, which was applied to a prototype azido&#8208;functionalized tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS) scaffold molecule. The stereoisomers could be distinguished based on an X&#8208;ray structure of one of the isomeric key intermediates. As previously shown with divalent counterparts, such heterotrivalent cluster glycosides are useful tools for studying the fine&#8208;tuning of carbohydrate recognition. The azido functional group at the focal point of the synthetic scaffold molecule was employed in a conjugation reaction with a linker for further immobilization on a gold surface in order to fabricate glyco&#8208;SAMs (self&#8208;assembled monolayers). A preliminary biological evaluation of the focal point enantiomers was performed in solution using the well&#8208;known model lectin Concanavalin A and the important bacterial lectin FimH.

         <title>Organocatalytic Applications of Sulfonyl Squaramides in Anion&#8208;Recognition Strategies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 47, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Appealing, highly acidic N&#8208;sulfonyl squaramides have been designed and synthesized. This versatile architecture provided an excellent catalytic activity in anion&#8208;recognition strategies, as illustrated in the multicomponent dearomatization of 2&#8208;picoline with silyl ketene acetals and Friedel&#8208;Crafts tritylation of N&#8208;methylindole.







Abstract
A modular, 3&#8208;steps protocol for the synthesis of N&#8208;sulfonyl squaramides has been developed. The strategic installation of a tetrahedral, electron&#8208;withdrawing sulfonyl group into the squaramido core allowed the prevention of undesired self&#8208;aggregations, therefore upgrading the solubility in common organic solvents, and moreover, enhancing their H&#8208;bond donor abilities for molecular recognition. These unique features have been efficiently exploited in two different ion&#8208;pairing reactions: (i) the challenging C4&#8208;selective dearomatization of 2&#8208;picoline with silyl ketene acetals and (ii) the tritylation of N&#8208;methylindole. Furthermore, their catalytic activities have been directly compared with other common and well&#8208;established (thio)urea analogues and related H&#8208;bond donors, revealing that highly acidic designs are essential to reach optimal catalytic performances.

         <title>Synthesis of Anthracene&#8208;Based Mechanofluorochromic Molecules and Their Differential Mechanochromic Effects Triggered by Nitrogen Atoms</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 47, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By fine&#8208;tuning the position of the nitrogen atom, three anthracene&#8208;based mechanofluorochromic compounds were designed and synthesized. The three compounds exhibit similar photophysical properties in solution, but exhibit completely different photophysical properties and mechanofluorochromic properties in the solid state.







Abstract
To investigate the influence of nitrogen atoms on the mechanofluorochromic (MFC) properties, three novel anthracene&#8208;based MFC compounds were designed and synthesized, and the effects of nitrogen atom position changes on their photophysical properties and MFC properties were deeply explored. The structure of the three compounds maintains the anthracene and enone portions unchanged, with only subtle adjustments made to the position of the nitrogen atom in the pyridine moiety. Experimental verification revealed that these three anthracene&#8208;based compounds exhibit almost identical photophysical properties in solution but display significantly different fluorescence colors and distinct MFC properties in the solid state. The findings of this study not only offer a new perspective for understanding the MFC mechanism of anthracene&#8208;based compounds but also provide valuable insights for the design and development of novel MFC molecules.

         <title>Silver(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Syntheses of Triarylmethanes (TRAMs)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 47, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
After a broad screening of Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acids, AgNTf2 was shown to catalyze the synthesis of symmetrical and unsymmetrical triarylmethanes (TRAMs) in moderate to excellent yields (30&#8211;99&#8201;% yield, 35 examples) with the tolerance of ester and cyano groups.







Abstract
The synthesis of triarylmethanes was evaluated in the presence of various Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acids under the same stoichiometric conditions. An efficient silver(I)&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of triarylmethanes is reported. The reaction offers low catalyst loadings and quasi&#8208;stoichiometric conditions (1&#8211;1.2&#8197;equiv. of electrophile) to access to symmetrical and unsymmetrical TRAMs in moderate to excellent yields (35 examples). Broad substrate scope was observed, including compatibility with ester and cyano groups.

         <title>Construction of Multiple Five&#8208;Membered Rings in Dibenzo[g,p]chrysene Core for the Synthesis of a Nona&#8208;Cycle Buckybowl</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 47, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relevant synthesis to an unexplored nona&#8208;cycle buckybowl (C28H14, 3,10&#8208;dihydroindeno[7,1,2&#8208;pqr]&#8208;as&#8208;indaceno[3,2,1,8,7&#8208;defghi]chrysene) is described. The key precursor is a solution&#8208;processable hexacycle having twofold bromines and fourfold ethers. The bromines enabled forming the first two pentagons, and then the ethers facilitated yielding the nona&#8208;cycle C60&#8208;fragmentary bowl&#8208;structure, unattainable so far.







Abstract
C60&#8208;fragmentary bowl&#8208;shaped molecules, commonly referred to as &#8220;buckybowls&#8221;, are provocative compounds, and their inviting functions based on the non&#8208;planar &#960;&#8208;conjugation are expected. Yet, achieving synthesis of some kinds of the curved structure remaining challenging. Herein we report skeletal construction of a nona&#8208;cyclic buckybowl that is synthetically unachievable heretofore, namely, 3,10&#8208;dihydroindeno[7,1,2&#8208;pqr]&#8208;as&#8208;indaceno[3,2,1,8,7&#8208;defghi]chrysene. The key to success was solution&#8208;compatible process in which a multiple substituted dibenzo[g,p]chrysene is amenable to threefold formation of five&#8208;membered rings at its periphery. The resulting scheme here, coupled with the gently curved scaffold, offers a new insight into the solution&#8208;phase synthesis of curved and twisted polyarenes.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of (Z)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Thioenamide from (Z)&#8208;Enamide&#8208;Iodines and Thiols under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 47, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we firstly provided an efficient and general method for synthesis of polyfunctional (Z)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;thioenamide from (Z)&#8208;enamide&#8208;iodines reagents and thiols or thiophenols under mild condition. This method provided high yield of up to 95&#8201;% for the (Z)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;thioenamide, with all Z/E ratios reaching up to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1. The valuable (Z)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;thioenamides can serve as precursors for producing oxazoles and &#946;&#8208;amido sulfones.







Abstract
The (Z)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;thioenamides is a valuable motif in many drugs. However, it's stereoselective synthesis is still facing challenge. Herein, we firstly reported a general and efficient approach for highly stereoselective synthesis of them by using (Z)&#8208;enamide&#8208;iodines with thiols under transition metal&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>Controlled Ru (II) &amp; Rh (III) Catalyzed [4+2] &amp; [4+1] Carbo&#8208;Annulations via C&#8722;H Activation Using Sulfoxonium Ylide and Maleimide: Facile Access to Fused Benzoisoindole &amp; Spiroindanone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 47, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy has been developed to synthesize both complex spiroindanone&#8208;type molecules and benzoisoindole derivatives by taking advantage of the capabilities of sulfoxonium ylide to act as directing group as well as carbene source in the C&#8722;H activation/functionalization reactions, followed by transition metal&#8208;mediated carbo&#8208;annulations in [4+2] or [4+1] with maleimide derivatives







Abstract
A well&#8208;ordered strategy of sulfoxonium ylides as a directing group as well as carbene source for the Ru&#8208;catalysed [4+2] and Rh&#8208;catalysed [4+1] carbo&#8208;annulations with maleimides has been described. These novel methodologies have been successfully established for the synthesis of complex spiroindanones and benzoisoindoles containing compounds by the transition metal&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H activation/functionalization reactions. Further, Rh&#8208;catalysed [4+1] annulated compounds were obtained in the absence of any oxidant. A possible rationale for the remarkable divergent selectivity between the two catalysts has been proposed.

         <title>Homobarrelenones: Versatile Building Blocks for the Construction of Novel and Structurally Diverse Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 47, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Derivatization of tropolone&#8211;based homobarrelenones through hydrogenation, base&#8208;catalyzed solvolysis, and hydride reduction leads to structurally complex and highly functionalized scaffolds. Results from preliminary sperm motility assays underscore the importance of Michael acceptor moieties in the biological activity of this class of compounds.







Abstract
We describe the derivatization of tropolone&#8211;based homobarrelenones through simple transformations, including catalytic hydrogenations, base&#8208;catalyzed solvolysis, and hydride reductions. Despite being structurally complex and highly functionalized, the novel compounds had no significant cytotoxicity in sperm motility assays, underscoring the importance of Michael acceptor moieties in the biological activity of this class of compounds.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Four&#8208;Component Carbonylation Reactions of Acetylene: Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Perfluoroalkyl Acrylamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 47, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we have developed the first efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component carbonylation of acetylene toward &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl acrylamides. The synthetic utility of our protocol was showcased further in the diversification of ibrutinib and other bio&#8208;active molecules, demonstrating great potential for drug discovery.







Abstract
The simplest alkyne, acetylene, is a suitable C2 linker synthon that enables the connection of organic molecules with different functional groups. However, reactions of acetylene with advanced organic building blocks are much less explored compared to substituted alkynes. In this article, we present a straightforward palladium&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component carbonylation reaction with acetylene, CO, amines, and perfluoroalkyl halides that enables the preparation of various &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl acrylamides in one step. This protocol also provides a new strategy for the late&#8208;stage modification of bioactive molecules, as demonstrated by the construction of &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl ibrutinib derivatives.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 47, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic system utilizing TMS&#8226;OTf has been developed for the purpose of selectively thiolating electron&#8208;rich arenes and heteroarenes. Environment&#8208;friendly sulfur surrogates are employed for chalcogenation in this one&#8208;pot single strategy, which takes place under mild conditions and yields para&#8208;thio&#8208;substituted arenes and 3&#8208;sulfenyl&#8208;indoles in good to excellent yields.







Abstract
An efficient catalytic system employing TMS&#8226;OTf for the regioselective thiolation of electron&#8208;rich arenes with sulfonyl hydrazides has been developed. The reaction occurs in a solvent mixture of dichloroethane and trifluoroethanol under mild conditions, with the addition of water. This method furnishes a range of para&#8208;thio&#8208;substituted arenes and 3&#8208;sulfenyl&#8208;indoles in good to excellent yields, marking a significant advancement in organic synthesis.

         <title>Chemoselective Intramolecular Rauhut&#8208;Currier Reaction on a Labile Framework of Enone and Acrylamide: Tricyclohexylphosphine as a Stable and Economical Catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 47, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tricyclohexylphosphine mediated an Intramolecular Rauhut&#8208;Currier reaction, using acrylamide as a source of initial enolate, has been achieved. The reaction has broad substrate scope. Control experiments have been used to address the instability of precursors.







Abstract
Intramolecular Rauhut&#8208;Currier (IRC) reaction is an atom&#8208;economical way of making carbocyclic and heterocyclic rings. However, its sensitivity towards electronic and steric parameters limits the reaction and stems the need for further development. Acrylamides have been one such left out of their sensitivity. Herein we report an IRC reaction, using acrylamide as a source of initial enolate. The cyclization has been achieved on a labile and challenging framework, prone to decomposition. Different control experiments have addressed the instability of the precursor. Protocol was further extendable to annulation for benzo analogs. We also report tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy3) as a stable, commercial, and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use nucleophilic catalyst in the field of IRC reactions as compared to earlier well&#8208;established trimethyl and tributyl phosphines. Me3P and Bu3P although useful, are sensitive, prone to oxidation, and need careful handling. The protocol leads to the synthesis of piperidone and dihydroquinolone frameworks. A quick study to test the feasibility of catalyzing the Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) reaction by PCy3 was also done successfully, although in moderate yields.

         <title>Synthesis of Double Benzimidazole&#8208;Fused Quinazolines and Pyrimidines Catalyzed by Recyclable Magnetic Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;74</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 47, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic method of double benzimidazole&#8208;fused quinazolines and pyrimidines was developed by recyclable magnetic Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 catalyzed nucleophilic aromatic/vinylic substitution and oxidative cyclization of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;bromoaryl)&#8208;/2&#8208;(2&#8208;bromovinyl)benzimidazoles with benzimidazoles.







Abstract
2&#8208;(2&#8208;Bromoaryl)&#8208; and 2&#8208;(2&#8208;bromovinyl)benzimidazoles are combined and cyclized with benzimidazoles using a catalytic amount of magnetic Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 (Fe3O4@SiO2@Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;74) and a base under O2 atmosphere, yielding the corresponding double benzimidazole&#8208;fused quinazolines and pyrimidines. The catalyst can be recovered using a magnetic bar and reused multiple times without significant loss of catalytic activity. The reaction mechanism likely involves the initial formation of a C&#8722;N coupled intermediate through nucleophilic aromatic substitution, followed by oxidative cyclization.

         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free method for the &#945;&#8208;(hetero)arylation of indolyl acetamides was developed. Various (hetero)arylating reagents such as indoles, pyrroles, furan, N, N&#8208;dimethylanilines, and electron&#8208;rich benzenes were tolerated. The usage of an aryloxy group as the activator of amide led to the success of this transformation.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;(hetero)arylation of aryloxy&#8208;activated amides for access to diaryl&#8208;acetamides was developed. This base&#8208;mediated arylation reaction features mild reaction conditions and broad functional groups tolerance. The scope of (hetero)arylating reagents includes indoles, pyrroles, furan, N, N&#8208;dimethylanilines, and electron&#8208;rich benzenes. The applicability of this protocol was demonstrated by the gram&#8208;scale experiment and the derivatization of the target products.

An effective method for synthesizing multi&#8208;functionalized indolizine via tandem Knoevenagel&#8208;aldol cyclization, yielding a scaffold with a C6 hydroxy group and a C7 ethyl ester/aldehyde group under mild conditions with excellent efficiency.







Abstract
An effective method for the construction of a multi&#8208;functionalized pyridine motif of indolizine using the [4+2] annulation pathway involves tandem Knoevenagel&#8208;aldol cyclization as a critical step in the process. The production of an indolizine scaffold with a hydroxy group at the C6 position and an ethyl ester/aldehyde group at the C7 position was successfully accomplished using this approach with an excellent yield, with the use of a reagent that contains active methylene and operates under mild conditions. This straightforward and simple protocol allows extensions of the core moiety in a quick and dependable manner.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Preliminary In&#8208;Vitro Activity of 6&#8208;Hydroxyalkyl &#946;&#8208;Carboline Derivatives for the Development of Drug Conjugates Targeting MDM2</title>

The mouse&#8208;double&#8208;minute&#8208;2 (MDM2) protein represents a promising target for the development of novel anticancer therapies. A series of MDM2 inhibitors based on a &#946;&#8208;carboline scaffold and containing a functionalized alkyl chain of variable length at the 6&#8208;position, was synthesized, docked in the active site of MDM2 protein and tested for antiproliferative activity towards U87MG glioblastoma cell line







Abstract
The mouse&#8208;double&#8208;minute&#8208;2 (MDM2) protein, the main downregulator of the tumor suppressor p53 protein, represents a promising target for the development of novel anticancer therapies. However, the lack of selectivity and poor effectiveness in tumors bearing mutated&#8208;p53 impaired the approval of several MDM2 inhibitors for the market. In this context, the possibility of generating drug&#8208;conjugates within a MDM2 inhibitor is a growing research area aimed to overcome these drawbacks. Considering the promising MDM2 inhibition by the &#946;&#8208;carboline&#8208;based 1, in this work we explored the introduction of a new functionalization on it for a future conjugation while preserving its anticancer properties. Based on preliminary docking studies, we synthesized derivatives 2&#8201;a&#8211;d having linear hydroxyalkyl chains with different lengths at the 6&#8208;position of the &#946;&#8208;carboline core, which effectively preserved the submicromolar IC50 on wild&#8208;type&#8208;p53&#8208;U87MG glioblastoma cell line observed with 1. Candidates 2&#8201;a, d showed the functionalization was tolerated with respect of bioactivity also on mutated&#8208;p53&#8208;U138MG glioblastoma cell line, and their hydroxyl groups proved to be easily accessible when coupled to 4&#8208;pentynoic&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylethylenediamine affording derivatives 10&#8201;a, d with high yields. In summary, our results led to generating novel 6&#8208;hydroxyalkyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carboline compounds displaying a suitable hydroxyl&#8208;site useful to improve the efficacy and/or the tumor specificity of 1 through conjugation strategies.

Abstract
An efficient synthesis of polychloroalkylated indolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines has been achieved via aryldiazonium salt induced radical cyclization reaction of N&#8208;methylallyl&#8208;2&#8208;arylindoles with dichloromethane or trichloromethane. In this reaction, neither metal catalyst nor additional oxidant was required, and an isoquinoline ring was constructed by tandem radical additions on the nonactivated carbon&#8208;carbon double bond of allyl group in 2&#8208;arylindoles. This protocol features advantages of wide substituent scope, environmentally friendly conditions and good yields.

The first case of photo&#8208;Nazarov cyclization of indole&#8208;2&#8208;yl vinyl ketone to indeno[2,1&#8208;b]indole with 91&#8201;% yield for (6aS, 10aR)&#8208;product was developed. And the protocol was employed for the synthesis of a series of natural product&#8208;like analogues with novel indeno[2,1&#8208;b]indole/shikimic acid hybrid scaffold. Even more attractive, several synthesized analogs were proved potent anti&#8208;osteoclastogenic activity and promising pharmacological value.







Abstract
Indeno[2,1&#8208;b]indole and shikimic acid&#8208;like structures are natural privileged scaffolds in several bioactive NPs. In this work, we developed a high&#8208;efficient and diastereoselective synthetic approach to construct novel indeno[2,1&#8208;b]indole/shikimic acid hybrid analogues via photo&#8208;Nazarov reaction. The protocol is the first case of excited&#8208;state photo&#8208;Nazarov cyclization of indole&#8208;2&#8208;yl vinyl ketone to indeno[2,1&#8208;b]indole. (6aS, 10aR)&#8208;products were afforded in moderate to good yields (37&#8211;92&#8201;%) for most of substrates (91&#8201;% for model substrate 1&#8201;aa) after the condition optimization. Even more attractive, several synthesized analogues (2&#8201;t, 3&#8201;c and 3&#8201;d) exhibited potent RANKL&#8208;induced osteoclastogenesis inhibitory activities (inhibitory rate &gt;50&#8201;% at 5&#8197;&#956;M), which suggested promising prospect of the novel tetracyclic indeno[2,1&#8208;b]indole/shikimic acid hybrid scaffold for anti&#8208;osteoporosis drug development.

&lt;p&gt;The first case of photo-Nazarov cyclization of indole-2-yl vinyl ketone to indeno[2,1-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]indole with 91&#8201;% yield for (6a&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;, 10a&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-product was developed. And the protocol was employed for the synthesis of a series of natural product-like analogues with novel indeno[2,1-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]indole/shikimic acid hybrid scaffold. Even more attractive, several synthesized analogs were proved potent anti-osteoclastogenic activity and promising pharmacological value.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeno[2,1-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]indole and shikimic acid-like structures are natural privileged scaffolds in several bioactive NPs. In this work, we developed a high-efficient and diastereoselective synthetic approach to construct novel indeno[2,1-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]indole/shikimic acid hybrid analogues &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; photo-Nazarov reaction. The protocol is the first case of excited-state photo-Nazarov cyclization of indole-2-yl vinyl ketone to indeno[2,1-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]indole. (6a&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;, 10a&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-products were afforded in moderate to good yields (37&#8211;92&#8201;%) for most of substrates (91&#8201;% for model substrate &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;aa&lt;/b&gt;) after the condition optimization. Even more attractive, several synthesized analogues (&lt;b&gt;2&#8201;t&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;d&lt;/b&gt;) exhibited potent RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis inhibitory activities (inhibitory rate &amp;gt;50&#8201;% at 5&#8197;&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;M), which suggested promising prospect of the novel tetracyclic indeno[2,1-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]indole/shikimic acid hybrid scaffold for anti-osteoporosis drug development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functionalized Phosphorus&#8208;Doped Porous Organic Polymers (FPPOPs) &#8208;Promoted Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Arylation of Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 47, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel porous organic polymers (POPs) that exhibited tunable and hyper&#8208;crosslinked, regular pore sizes and abundant micro/mesoporous structure, were prepared from co&#8208;polymerization of vinyl&#8208;substituted polyhedral oligomeric silsequioxane (POSS) and vinyl&#8208;substituted triphenylphosphine (ViPPh3), and it possessed excellent performance in the enhancement of chemoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation of hydrosilanes.







Abstract
The development of novel catalyst systems, especially as highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts for Si&#8722;C bond &#8208;forming arylation reaction of hydrosilanes is highly desirable. Herein, we developed a simple and eco&#8208;friendly methodology for construction of functionalized phosphorus&#8208;doped porous organic polymers (FPPOPs) and its heterogeneous palladium catalyst through anchoring on FPPOPs bearing a phosphine ligand, in which the fabrication of FPPOPs was completed through the vinyl&#8208;substituted triphenylphosphine (ViPPh3) and vinyl&#8208;substituted polyhedral oligomeric silsequioxane (ViPOSS) as well as functional olefins via radical co&#8208;polymerization. All these FPPOPs could act as a phosphine ligand for Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation of hydrosilanes have been characterized by SEM, FTIR, and X&#8208;RAD. Moreover, the POSS&#8208;based functionalized phosphorus&#8208;doped porous organic polymers (POSS&#8208;PPOPs) proved to be a high efficiency catalyst system for Si&#8722;C bond &#8208;forming arylation of hydrosilanes with aryl iodides and with good yields as well as excellent chemoselectivity with low amount of catalyst under mild conditions. The mechanistic studies supported the effect of functional group on the catalytic activity of Pd/FPPOPs catalyst, which revealed that the weak coordination as well as non&#8208;covalent interaction between porous organic polymers and substrate played important role in the enhancement of chemoselectivity.

         <title>Electrooxidative Thiocyanation of Hydroxy&#8208; and Alkoxybenzenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 47, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an original method for thiocyanating C&#8722;H bonds in various phenols and their derivatives using readily available materials via electrogenerated (SCN)&#8322; and its Zn(II) complex. The process led to a diverse range of target products with yields of 36&#8211;97&#8201;% (include the drug riluzole and precursors for toltrazuril and ponazuril) under mild conditions.







Abstract
We developed an original method for thiocyanation of hydroxy&#8208; and alkoxy&#8208;substituted benzenes (including naturally occurring compounds) using electrogenerated thiocyanogen, (SCN)&#8322;. The presence of zinc chloride as a Lewis acid significantly enhances reaction efficiency by activating thiocyanogen. Cyclic voltammetry of the reactants and their combinations was employed to optimize reaction conditions and investigate the proposed mechanisms. This method demonstrated broad synthetic utility, leading to mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;thiocyanated arenes and various heterocycles with yields 36&#8211;97&#8201;%. Notable products include the neuroprotective drug riluzole and precursors for the antiprotozoal drugs toltrazuril and ponazuril.

We have developed an efficient Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed remote selective cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of broadly useful synthetic building blocks biphenyl Weinreb amides with carboxylic acids at room temperature. This work presents a remote selective Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of biphenyl Weinreb amides with carboxylic acids at room temperature. The broad substrate compatibility, scalability, and the directing groups modifiability highlights the method's significance for pharmaceutical applications.







Abstract
An efficient Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed remote selective cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of broadly useful synthetic building blocks biphenyl Weinreb amides with carboxylic acids is developed. This acetoxylation protocol is performed under room temperature using N&#8208;fluorobenzene&#8208;sulfonimide (NFSI) as the oxidant, exhibiting a wide range of functional group tolerance and affording &#948;&#8208;position&#8208; selective products up to 85&#8201;% yield. Notably, a diverse set of carboxylic acid&#8208;containing drugs is also found to be compatible under the current reaction conditions. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that this reaction presumably proceeds through a seven&#8208;membered palladacycle intermediate.

         <title>Filling the Gap within 10&#8208;Membered Heteroenediynes: Thiaenediyne &#8211; An Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 47, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiaenediyne, as a member of the heteroenediynes fused to a benzothiophene core, was synthesized using the S&#8208;type Nicholas cyclization. NBO analysis was used to demonstrate the primary role of the heteroatom in an enediyne core for the reactivity of enediynes in the Bergman cyclization.







Abstract
The heteroatom nature in 10&#8208;membered enediynes plays a crucial role in tuning of their reactivity in the Bergman cyclization, which is a decisive factor for the biological activity of enediynes. Although benzothiophene&#8208;fused O&#8208; and N&#8208;enediynes have been identified as promising biological objects, the corresponding thiaenediyne remains unknown. To fill this gap, we synthesized the thiaanalog and studied it in both practical and theoretical terms. While the Nicholas reaction has proven to be an effective cyclization technique for the preparation of heteroenediynes, in the case of thiaenediyne it was accompanied by an unusual acid&#8208;promoted intramolecular cyclization, forming a thiepinium salt. The S&#8208;enediyne has reduced reactivity in the Bergman cyclization relative to the N&#8208; and O&#8208;enediynes, attributed to the diminished alkyne bending and extended cd&#8208;distance. The NBO analysis of the entire series, namely the evaluation of &#960;in/out(C2&#8208;CC)&#8594;&#963;*(C&#8722;X) hyperconjugation, revealed that the S atom in S&#8208;enediyne provides stronger stabilization of the initial compound than the N atom in N&#8208;enediyne, while exhibiting the weakest stabilization of the Bergman cyclization transition state. NICS values were employed to examine the change in aromaticity along the Bergman cyclization coordinate. This approach, in conjunction with the NBO analysis, provides a foundation for further rational design of unnatural enediynes.

         <title>Catalyzing the Enantioselective Tail&#8208;to&#8208;Head Terpene Cyclization Inside Optically Active Hexameric Resorcin[4]arene Capsules: A Surprising Odd&#8208;Even Effect of the Catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 47, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the enantioselective tail&#8208;to&#8208;head terpene cyclization inside hexameric capsules self&#8208;assembled from optically active resorcin[4]arene derivatives. An unexpected odd&#8208;even effect was uncovered, where the enantioselectivity of the reaction depended on the number of methylene units present on the linear alkyl chain connected to the resorcin[4]arene derivative.







Abstract
Terpenes, created in Nature via tail&#8208;to&#8208;head terpene (THT) cyclizations, have long fascinated chemists due to their complex structures and biological activities. Recreating such THT cyclizations in the laboratory using man&#8208;made catalysts has been challenging. Especially difficult is performing the reaction in an enantioselective fashion, as the substrate is flexible and does not contain much functionality to form strong interactions with the chiral catalyst. This study explores the enantioselective THT cyclization inside hexameric capsules self&#8208;assembled from optically active resorcin[4]arene derivatives. An unexpected odd&#8208;even effect, where the enantioselectivity of the reaction depended on the length of the alkyl chain attached to the resorcin[4]arene capsule was uncovered. To our knowledge, this is the first example of an odd&#8208;even effect in the catalyst itself, and also the first instance in which this effect is related to the enantioselectivity of the reaction.

The Front Cover illustrates a new member of the heteroenediyne group obtained through Nicholas cyclization. Although thiaenediyne is the least reactive in the Bergman cyclization, its appearance allows the application of NBO analysis to the entire family of benzothiophene&#8208;conjugated heteroenediynes, thus substantiating the major role of the heteroatom in the enediyne moiety for the reactivity of enediynes in the Bergman cyclization. More details can be found in the Research Article by I.&#8197;A. Balova and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/ejoc.202401127).

         <title>Electroreduction Reactions Mediated by Organic Molecules: Recent Advances and Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 47, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organo&#8208;mediated electroreduction has emerged as a promising approach, in which organo&#8208;mediators can gain electrons from the electrode to form active intermediates and then efficiently activate the substrates through the electron transfer process. This review will provide a detailed description of electroreduction reactions mediated by organic molecules in recent years and elucidate the mechanism of the organo&#8208;mediators in the transformations.







Abstract
Electroreduction is an important aspect of organic electrochemistry. Its chemistry does not require the addition of additional reductants, making it an effective alternative to various traditional reduction reactions. Among them, organo&#8208;mediated electroreduction is recognized as a promising approach. Organo&#8208;mediators can be reduced directly at the cathode to form reactive radical anions that subsequently reduce the substrate via electron transfer (ET) to initiate the reaction being investigated. Organo&#8208;mediators typically have a more positive reduction potential, and their role in the whole reaction is similar to that of catalysts. Their addition transforms the ET process from the original heterogeneous process into a homogeneous one. Organo&#8208;mediated electroreduction can effectively avoid the over&#8208;electrolysis of the substrate and the product at the electrode and the intolerance of sensitive substrates or functional groups during electrolysis, thereby preventing the occurrence of side reactions. It can also prevent the excessive consumption of reagents and electrical energy while promoting the reaction to achieve higher or completely different selectivity. Considering the advantages of this type of reaction, this review will provide a detailed description of electroreduction reactions mediated by organic molecules in recent years and elucidate the mechanism of the organo&#8208;mediators in the transformations.

Site&#8208;specifically arylated heteroarenes constitute privileged scaffolds in medicinal chemistry and functional materials. Commonly used transition&#8208;metal based approaches present cost and environmental related issues, demanding sustainable alternatives. This article reports the recent transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free strategies for the regioselective C&#8722;H arylation/heteroarylation of heteroarenes. Arylations of several five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered, nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur containing heteroarenes using various arylation/heteroarylation reagents are comprehensively reviewed.







Abstract
Regioselectively arylated heteroarenes are privileged scaffolds with remarkable biological and optoelectronic properties. Traditional arylation approaches based on the transition&#8208;metal catalysis present various issues related to the cost of synthesis and environmental sustainability. The growing applications of arylheteroarenes in pharmaceuticals and cutting&#8208;edge technologies have fuelled interest in the development of green and cost&#8208;effective synthetic approaches. This article reports the recent progress in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free strategies for the regioselective C&#8722;H arylation/heteroarylation of heteroarenes. C&#8722;H arylations of several five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered, nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur containing heteroarenes using various arylation/heteroarylation reagents are comprehensively reviewed.

         <title>Direct Introduction of Perfluoroacyl (&#8722;CORF) Groups into Organic Substrates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 47, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct strategies towards the incorporation of perfluoroacyl (&#8722;CORF) groups into (hetero)aromatic compounds, &#8722;CORF substitutions at Csp3&#8722;H, alkyl halides, alkenes, amides, and N&#8208;atoms are discussed in detail. Future directions and perspectives in the field are suggested.







Abstract
The direct addition of perfluoroacyl (&#8722;CORF) groups to organic frameworks has seen a resurgence in interest due to the benefits of these groups in late&#8208;stage modification of pro&#8208;drugs and biologically active compounds, helping to identify new active leads. The presence of &#8722;CORF groups positively impacts the structure&#8208;activity relationships of these compounds. In that sense, both polar methods and radical protocols have been developed for the direct syntheses of trifluoromethyl and perfluoroalkyl ketones. In particular, methodologies to tame the unstable trifluoroacyl radical, which could be a key intermediate in the late&#8208;stage syntheses of trifluoroacyl&#8208;substituted compounds, has allowed much progress in this area. In the next sections, the direct incorporation of perfluoroacyl groups into (hetero)aromatic compounds, &#8722;CORF substitutions at Csp3&#8722;H, alkyl halides, alkenes, amides, and N&#8208;atoms will be discussed in detail, suggesting the future directions and perspectives in the field. These known reactions are summarized in Table&#8197;1.

In particular, methodologies to tame the unstable trifluoroacyl radical, which could be a key intermediate in the late-stage syntheses of trifluoroacyl-substituted compounds, has allowed much progress in this area. In the next sections, the direct incorporation of perfluoroacyl groups into (hetero)aromatic compounds, &#8722;COR&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; substitutions at C&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;H, alkyl halides, alkenes, amides, and N-atoms will be discussed in detail, suggesting the future directions and perspectives in the field. These known reactions are summarized in Table&#8197;1.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 47, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the continuous synthesis of ionic liquids and SILP&#8208;assisted continuous processes are reviewed in this manuscript. These catalyst frameworks still provide an attractive strategy in many organic transformations and provide a suitable tool for designing new synthetic approaches. This review focuses on recent developments in the research area from 2016 up until today.







Abstract
Herein, the developments in the field of continuous ionic liquid synthesis and continuous ionic liquid utilization from the last seven years are reviewed. Starting by discussing recent strategies for the preparation of ionic liquids themselves in different flow reactors, the review will further focus on various continuous strategies employing ionic liquids. The application of ionic liquids in continuous processes, particularly as supported catalytic layers, has drawn significant scientific interest in the last decades. These catalyst frameworks provide a versatile tool in many organic transformations, and their application became an attractive strategy in continuous catalytic approaches.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Macrocyclization for the Synthesis of Planar&#8208;Chiral Cyclophanes: Recent Updates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 47, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review of catalytic enantioselective macrocyclization for the synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral cyclophanes is provided. There are three primary methods for accessing these frameworks: transition metal&#8208;catalyzed, organocatalyzed, and biocatalyzed. These methods enable the control of the planar chirality during the macrocycles construction, significantly enhancing the synthesis efficiency. These accomplishments have significant implications for drug discovery, chiral catalysts, and materials science.







Abstract
The planar chirality of macrocycles is a fascinating research topic. Locking the configurational flip between the benzene ring and macrocycle leads to planar chirality, which can significantly enhance the biological activity of cyclophanes. Planar&#8208;chiral cyclophanes are widely used in pharmaceuticals, chiral catalysts, and functional materials. However, accessing planar&#8208;chiral cyclophanes via asymmetric catalysis has remained challenging. Among the various strategies, asymmetric macrocyclization provides a powerful tool for accessing planar&#8208;chiral cyclophanes. This method allows for control of the planar chirality when constructing the macrocycle and greatly improves the efficiency. There are three types of macrocyclization reactions: transition metal&#8208;catalyzed, organocatalyzed, and biocatalyzed. In addition, the chiral confinement strategy breaks through conservative synthetic approaches. This review summarizes these achievements, aiming to highlight the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of cyclophanes and inspire interested researchers.

         <title>Electrochemical Transformations of Enamines: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 47, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enamines, containing multi&#8208;reactive active sites, have received extensive attention and rapid development under the background of electrochemical renaissance in recent years. The review systematically summarizes recent electrochemical transformation of enamines and future perspectives of this field.







Abstract
Enamines, containing nucleophilic amino groups and activated C=C bonds, are important building blocks, and widely used in the synthesis of heterocycles, natural products, and pharmaceuticals. In recent years, electrosynthesis has gradually developed into a powerful protocol for constructing chemical bonds due to its high economy, environmental friendliness, and mild reaction conditions. This review summarized the recent advances in the electrochemical transformation of enamines, including the construction of heterocyclic compounds, C(sp2)&#8722;H bond functionalization of enamines for synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted alkenes, and the functionalization reactions of enamines via C=C double bond cleavage. The reaction conditions and mechanisms were systematically discussed, and the challenges and future directions of this field were included in this review.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Induced Amplification of Chiral Superstructures of Carbazole Porphyrins in Dynamic Supramolecular Aggregates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we investigated supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of carbazole porphyrins in mixture of chloroform and methanol. In chloroform, porphyrins assembled into micro&#8208;belt superstructures, however, 90&#8201;% MeOH in chloroform resulted chiral helical microfibres of 1 and twisted helical ribbons of 2, respectively. The chiral superstructures utilizing the fundamental self&#8208;assembly principle, in which one directional growth of chiral superstructures is due to &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of core of porphyrin along with hydrophobic interaction of the ethyl hexyl chain.







Abstract
Herein, we reported design, synthesis and investigation for supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of two types of carbazole porphyrins one with free base carbazole porphyrin (codes as 1), and second one zinc (II) metalated carbazole porphyrin (codes as 2) in the various ratios of chloroform (CHCl3, non&#8208;polar) and methanol (MeOH, polar) mixed solvent. Typically, in only chloroform both 1 and 2 produce micro&#8208;belt like structures, while increasing polar solvents i.&#8201;e. 90&#8201;% MeOH in CHCl3 (v/v, 9&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio), 1 resulted as helical microfibres, however, 2 assembled into twisted helical ribbons, respectively. The solution based solvophobic effect on self&#8208;assembly demonstrated by using circular dichroism (CD), UV&#8208;Vis and emission spectroscopy. Furthermore, X&#8208;ray diffraction was used to confirm amorphous nature of assembly and DFT for computational study used to find energy band gap between carbazole and porphyrin. Importantly, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was employed to visualise chiral supramolecular superstructures of 1 and 2, respectively. It is clear that growth of chiral superstructures is due to &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of porphyrin core along with hydrophobic interaction of the ethyl hexyl chain. Thus, it is clear that adjusting the ratio of polar to non&#8208;polar solvent, hydrophobic carbazole porphyrins confirmed formation of chiral superstructures.

         <title>&#946;&#8208;halovinyl Aldehydes: Multifaceted Versatile Building Blocks In Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vilsmeier&#8208;Haack reaction is an important tool to synthesize &#946;&#8208;halovinyl aldehyde which is a ptential aldo&#8208;x bifunctional building block (AXB3). Multiple reactive sites and high reactivity of formyl group and vinylic/benzylic halogen makes them fast reacting electrophiles offering fertile land for diverse organic transformations. In this review, we have assembled all the contributions from mid&#8208;2007 to Jan 2024.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;halovinyl aldehydes serve as a valuable building blocks in organic synthesis. These aldo&#8208;x bifunctional building blocks (AXB3s) contain a alkenic double bond (vinyl) as well as a formyl group along with a halogen atom (Cl, Br, I) bonded with the &#946;&#8208;carbon atom of vinyl aldehyde. Owing to the presence of these multiple reactive sites, &#946;&#8208;halovinyl aldehydes act as a suitable precursor for Michael addition, direct addition, addition&#8208;elimination reactions, cross&#8208;coupling reactions, condensation reactions, nucleophilic substitution reactions, domino reactions, MCRs, Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, functional group transformation reactions and enantioselective transformations. Therefore, a comprehensive review on synthetic exploration of &#946;&#8208;halovinyl aldehydes has been carried out for the generation of reactive intermediates and diverse bioactive heterocycles by using various C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;S and C&#8722;O bond forming reactions. In this review, we have assembled the literature from mid&#8208;2007 to Jan 2024.

         <title>Stereo&#8208; and Chemoselective Enrichment of sp3 Character in Post&#8208;Ugi Morpholines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive study aimed at reducing the degree of unsaturation and consequently increasing the sp3 character in post&#8208;Ugi morpholines is conducted. The scaffold assembly involves triphenylphosphine&#8208;promoted umpolung oxa&#8208;Michael cyclization of Ugi adducts derived from propiolic acid and glycolaldehyde dimer. Diastereoselective heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation, combined with chemoselective amide reduction, enables the controlled modulation of the morpholine core&#8216;s rigidity.







Abstract
We conducted a systematic study on synthesis and modification of morpholine core using Ugi adducts derived from propiolic acid and glycolaldehyde dimer. The assembly step involved triphenylphosphine&#8208;promoted 6&#8208;exo&#8208;dig umpolung oxa&#8208;Michael cyclization of Ugi&#8208;derived hydroxypropargylamides yielding 2&#8208;methylenemorpholin&#8208;3&#8208;one derivatives. Subsequent heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of the exocyclic double bond proceeded in a highly diastereoselective fashion establishing a relative cis configuration in the resulting sp3&#8208;enriched morpholinone scaffold. Finally, chemoselective amide reduction with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) allowed to obtain fully saturated morpholines while leaving the more sterically hindered exocyclic amide moiety intact. Taken together these findings outline the strategy for controlled reduction of the inherent rigidity of post&#8208;Ugi scaffolds.

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative Hydroxychalcogenation of Olefins with Disulfides/Thiols/Diselenides and H2O as Nucleophilic Oxygen Sources</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study details a novel electrochemical approach for the oxychalcogenation of olefins, employing disulfides, thiols, or diselenides as chalcogen sources and water as the nucleophilic oxygen source.







Abstract
A direct electrochemical redox reaction of olefins and disulfides/thiols/diselenides without external oxidants has been developed, which includes the hydroxychalcogenation of olefins. This procedure exhibited good functional group tolerance, and a series of &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfide/&#946;&#8208;hydroxyselenide derivatives were obtained in moderate to good yields. Mechanistic studies and cyclic voltammetry were also conducted to elucidate the reaction process.

         <title>Strong Acid&#8208;Free Homogeneous Catalytic Systems for the Ester Products Synthesis by Alkenes Alkoxycarbonylation: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The last 15&#8197;years publications on alkenes alkoxycarbonylation with alcohols and CO using homogeneous catalytic systems (based on Pd, Ru, Co, and Ni) in the absence of strong H&#8208;acids commonly used in these reactions were analyzed. As a result of these works, polyesters, monomers, and other valuable intermediates were obtained.







Abstract
Alkoxycarbonylation represents a method for the ester products synthesis from available reagents &#8211; unsaturated compounds, alcohols, and CO. The beginning of research on this reaction was laid in W. Reppe&#8217; works in 1953. In early works, halides and carbonyls of Co, Ni, Rh, and Ir were used as catalysts, and alkoxycarbonylation was often complicated by the unsaturated compounds hydroformylation or alcohol carbonylation. In recent decades, in the presence of the most active and selective Pd&#8208;phosphine systems with strong protonic acids, the products are typically only isomeric esters, which corresponds to the creating waste&#8208;free production principles. At present, a large&#8208;capacity synthesis process for methyl methacrylate, dubbed Alpha, is in operation, with the initial stage being ethylene methoxycarbonylation. In light of these developments, there is a growing interest among chemists and technologists in alkenes alkoxycarbonylation. The use of strong protonic acids as co&#8208;catalysts is essential for the formation of active catalytic complexes. However, these acids are highly corrosive and can cause the alkenes isomerisation. This review is devoted to the analysis of acid&#8208;free homogeneous Pd&#8208;, Ru&#8208;, Co&#8208;, and Ni&#8208;catalysts employed in alkenes alkoxycarbonylation over the past 15&#8197;years. As a result, polymers, monomers and other valuable linear and branched esters were obtained.

         <title>From Enzyme Encapsulation to Environmental Solutions: Photostable Laccase in Dopc Vesicles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The laccase enzyme offers significant advantages for the removal of organic contaminants; but its stability and effectiveness in bioremediation can be compromised by photo&#8208;induced degradation processes. To address this challenge, we investigated the immobilization of laccase in unilamellar and multilamellar vesicles of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) as a means to enhance its photo&#8208;stability while preserving its catalytic activity. Enzymatic activity was evaluated spectroscopically for both free and encapsulated laccase, before and after UVB irradiation.







Abstract
Our results demonstrate that DOPC vesicles effectively encapsulate the laccase enzyme, maintaining its activity within the vesicles. Moreover, the substrate syringaldazine, a model compound for laccase activity studies, was able to permeate through the bilayer. Notably, encapsulated laccase exhibited significantly higher retention of enzymatic activity (REA) post&#8208;irradiation compared to the free enzyme. In conclusion, both unilamellar and multilamellar vesicles provide substantial photoprotection for laccase against UVB light. This protective effect is attributed to the enzyme's confinement within a system that scatters high&#8208;energy photons.

&lt;p&gt;The laccase enzyme offers significant advantages for the removal of organic contaminants; but its stability and effectiveness in bioremediation can be compromised by photo-induced degradation processes. To address this challenge, we investigated the immobilization of laccase in unilamellar and multilamellar vesicles of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) as a means to enhance its photo-stability while preserving its catalytic activity. Enzymatic activity was evaluated spectroscopically for both free and encapsulated laccase, before and after UVB irradiation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results demonstrate that DOPC vesicles effectively encapsulate the laccase enzyme, maintaining its activity within the vesicles. Moreover, the substrate syringaldazine, a model compound for laccase activity studies, was able to permeate through the bilayer. Notably, encapsulated laccase exhibited significantly higher retention of enzymatic activity (REA) post-irradiation compared to the free enzyme. In conclusion, both unilamellar and multilamellar vesicles provide substantial photoprotection for laccase against UVB light. This protective effect is attributed to the enzyme's confinement within a system that scatters high-energy photons. Furthermore, the simplicity and ease of large-scale production of multilamellar vesicles present an advantageous option for various applications, including bioremediation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magnetite: a Green, Sustainable and Recyclable Catalyst for Direct Synthesis of Thioesters by C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A green and sustainable approach to the direct synthesis of thioesters has been developed using Fe3O4 as a low&#8208;cost, easily prepared, reusable and environmentally safe catalyst. The cross dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) of various thiols and aldehydes in water, or even in the absence of solvent, using tert&#8208;butylhydroperoxide as oxidant, under ligand and base&#8208;free mild conditions, afforded the corresponding thioesters in good to excellent yields. This simple protocol features broad substrate scope, good compatibility with different functional groups, as well as high atom&#8208;efficiency. The scalability, ease of (magnetic) recovery and reuse of the magnetite catalyst are additional eco&#8208;friendly attributes of this methodology. Moreover, the broad synthetic applications of thioesters further highlight the potential utility of the present protocol.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;component radical relay reaction of 1&#8208;acryloyl&#8208;2&#8208;cyanoindoles with 4&#8208;alkyl Hantzsch esters and Na2S2O5 to access alkylsulfonyl pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoledione derivatives has been developed.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component alkylsulfonylation/cyclization/hydrolysis relay reaction of 1&#8208;acryloyl&#8208;2&#8208;cyanoindoles with 4&#8208;alkyl Hantzsch esters and Na2S2O5 involving sulfur dioxide insertion has been established to access a series of alkylsulfonyl pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indolediones derivatives. With this method, a variety of primary and secondary alkyl radicals can be used for trapping sulfur dioxide and the corresponding alkylsulfonyl radical intermediates formed in&#8197;situ, followed by alkyl sulfonyl radical addition, cyclization and hydrolysis. This reaction involves selective cleavage of a carbon&#8208;carbon bond followed by successive formation of three new chemical bonds, in which the cyano group has dual roles as a radical acceptor and a carbonyl source.

         <title>Rare Earth Metal Reagents in Organic Synthesis: A Comprehensive Review</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare earth elements, as an important part of the periodic table, not only represent a frontier area but also possess unique chemical and physical properties that are distinct from those of main group elements and transition metals. Exploiting these unique characteristics to develop reaction systems not only holds profound academic value but also demonstrates extensive practical applications.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;mediated organic synthesis has significantly advanced the field of synthetic chemistry over the decades. While transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions have become foundational, characterized by well&#8208;understood mechanisms like oxidative addition and reductive elimination, rare earth metals have not received as much attention. This review aims to highlight the synthetic applications of rare earth metals, fostering increased interest in their exploration. We discuss various reactions facilitated by these metals, including substitution, addition, insertion into unsaturated bonds, and coupling reactions, showcasing their unique capabilities and potential in modern synthetic chemistry.

         <dc:description>
Using mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (mpg&#8208;C3N4) as a metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photocatalyst was developed for thiocyanation of alkenes under visible light irradiation with oxygen as green oxidant and without any other additives. The present protocol has excellent functional group tolerance and the desired tetrasubstituted alkenyl thiocyanides were obtained in moderate to good yields. Moreover, the recyclable mpg&#8208;C3N4 catalyst could be used at least 6&#8197;times without significant loss of activities.

         <dc:description>Reported here is a photocatalytic strategy for Ritter&#8208;type C&#8208;H amination of alkylarenes with nitriles. Under the irradiation of blue light and the catalysis of a simple Ce(III) salt, alkylarenes were brominated by CBr3COOH and thereby channeled to the normal Ritter pathway to afford amide products. A wide range of alkylarenes and nitriles were tolerated, with a few equivalents of a nitrile being feasible.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of 4&#8208;Aminotriazoles Through Click Cycloaddition and Generation of Iodonium(III) Triazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The divergent synthesis of 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles was accomplished through the Cu&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition of organic azides with alkynyliodonium(III) salts, followed by Cu&#8208;catalyzed triazole&#8208;amine coupling involving treatment with amines and amides. The in situ formation of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole iodonium salts is crucial to this approach, and the utilization of a Cu&#8208;catalyst facilitates cycloaddition and C&#8208;N bond formation. The synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;triazolyliodonium(III) salts proposed in this study offers advantages, including mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, and operational simplicity, while also providing efficient access to a complex and diverse range of 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Halogenation of Tyrosine N&#8208;Oxime Methyl Ester</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building blocks derived from tyrosine N&#8208;oxime have been used to construct natural products. We report the synthesis of nine halogenated tyrosine N&#8208;oxime derivatives reminiscent of biosynthetic precursors. Full conversion was ensured by the addition of p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (p&#8208;TsOH) for monohalogenation and a key oxidation&#8208;reduction sequence using excess N&#8208;bromo, N&#8208;chloro, or N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NBS, NCS, NIS) to provide dihalogenated derivatives.







Abstract
Efficient syntheses of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and heterodihalogenated derivatives of tyrosine N&#8208;oxime methyl ester are reported. Monohalogenation with N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS), N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide (NCS) or N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS) was optimized by addition of acid to suppress dihalogenation, affording bromo, chloro, and iodo derivatives in 71&#8201;%, 50&#8211;53&#8201;%, and 78&#8211;80&#8201;% yields, respectively. Homodihalogenation utilized a two&#8208;step, one&#8208;flask process via a spirocyclic intermediate, yielding dibromo, dichloro, and diiodo analogues, respectively (75&#8211;76&#8201;%, 54&#8211;56&#8201;%, 79&#8211;80&#8201;%). This strategy was extended to synthesize hetero&#8208;dihalogenated bromochloro, bromoiodo, and chloroiodo derivatives from monohalogenated analogues (50&#8211;77&#8201;%). Key to this approach was the formation of an oxidized spirocyclic intermediate using excess N&#8208;halosuccinimide, followed by Na&#8322;S&#8322;O&#8324; reduction. This method ensures complete conversion and simplifies purification. Nine halogenated building blocks were prepared. These methods provide practical access to versatile precursors for natural product synthesis and derivatization, offering potential for diverse synthetic applications including regioselective palladium&#8208;catalyzed couplings.

         <title>Benzoisoxazoles as Privileged Scaffolds in the Design and Synthesis of N&#8208;containing Molecules: A Recent Update</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exponential increase in the use of benzoisoxazoles as cycloaddition partners and amination reagents for the synthesis of highly valuable nitrogen&#8208;containing molecular scaffolds, particularly N&#8208;heterocycles, has garnered considerable attention. This review summarizes key advances from 2015 to 2024 in transformations of 2,1&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;benzoisoxazoles, with a focus on mechanisms, catalyst selectivity, and synthetic scope, while also addressing current challenges and future prospects.







Abstract
Benzoisoxazoles, with a distinctive 10&#8208;&#960;&#8208;electron system and significant polarity, readily trigger N&#8722;O bond cleavage, enabling multifaceted applications in organic synthesis. Over the past decade, the exponentially increased use of benzoisoxazoles towards the synthesis of highly valuable N&#8208;containing scaffolds, especially N&#8208;heterocycles, has garnered substantial attention. In this review, we summarize recent developments in the transformation of 2,1&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;benzoisoxazoles since 2015, highlighting the neglected resemblances of these two nitroxy heterocycles. Key processes in the assorted reactions of benzoisoxazoles, including mechanisms, scope, catalyst&#8208;controlled chemodivergence, current limitations, and developmental prospects, are also introduced and discussed.

     alt="Benzoisoxazoles as Privileged Scaffolds in the Design and Synthesis of N-containing Molecules: A Recent Update"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exponential increase in the use of benzoisoxazoles as cycloaddition partners and amination reagents for the synthesis of highly valuable nitrogen-containing molecular scaffolds, particularly &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocycles, has garnered considerable attention. This review summarizes key advances from 2015 to 2024 in transformations of 2,1- and 1,2-benzoisoxazoles, with a focus on mechanisms, catalyst selectivity, and synthetic scope, while also addressing current challenges and future prospects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benzoisoxazoles, with a distinctive 10-&#960;-electron system and significant polarity, readily trigger &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;O bond cleavage, enabling multifaceted applications in organic synthesis. Over the past decade, the exponentially increased use of benzoisoxazoles towards the synthesis of highly valuable &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-containing scaffolds, especially &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocycles, has garnered substantial attention. In this review, we summarize recent developments in the transformation of 2,1- and 1,2-benzoisoxazoles since 2015, highlighting the neglected resemblances of these two nitroxy heterocycles. Key processes in the assorted reactions of benzoisoxazoles, including mechanisms, scope, catalyst-controlled chemodivergence, current limitations, and developmental prospects, are also introduced and discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Hydroxylation of Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, substantial progress has been achieved in the synthesis of hydroxylated compounds from boronic acids. This review summarizes the representative methods over the past decade. The paper categorizes these methods based on the types of catalysts employed, encompassing a range of metal catalysts and non&#8208;metal catalysts, as well as other reaction types of catalyst&#8208;free.







Abstract
Hydroxylated compounds represent a significant and diverse class of substances in the field of chemistry. These compounds play critical roles in various chemical reactions and are essential components in numerous industrial applications. Recent years have witnessed remarkable advancements in the synthesis of hydroxylated compounds, especially those derived from boronic acids. The synthesis of hydroxylated compounds from boronic acids typically involves the utilization of various types of catalysts, which are essential for enhancing reaction rates and selectivity, including metal catalysts such as CuFe&#8322;O&#8324;, Cu@C&#8323;N&#8324;, AgNPs, and Ti0.97Ni0.3O1.97, as well as non&#8208;metal catalysts like polycaprolactone (PCL), TFB&#8208;BMTH COF materials, C70, and graphene oxide (GO). These catalytic reactions often require the addition of oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide (H&#8322;O&#8322;) or molecular oxygen, which serve as critical reagents in the hydroxylation process. In certain cases, organic bases act as electron donors to propel the reaction. Furthermore, some studies have reported oxidative hydroxylation reactions that are catalyst&#8208;free.This review aims to summarize the recent advancements and breakthroughs in the synthesis of hydroxylated compounds from boronic acids, with a particular focus on research conducted from 2014 to 2024.

A general methodology for the Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction of cycloenones and a variety of di&#8208; and tricarbonyl compounds. The methodology involves the use of a bifunctional Lewis base as catalyst in aqueous medium at room temperature. The synthetic applicability of the polyfunctionalized MBH adducts is demonstrated by the preparation of an acenaphtho[1,2&#8208;b]indole derivative.







Abstract
In this report, we present an extensive methodological study of the aqueous Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) reaction of a range of cycloenones with di&#8208; and tricarbonyl compounds, such as glyoxal derivatives, aliphatic and aromatic &#945;&#8208;keto esters, 1,2&#8208;diketones, diethyl ketomalonate, ninhydrin, acenaphthenequinone, and phenanthrene&#8208;9,10&#8208;dione, through mediation of a bicyclic imidazolyl alcohol (BIA) as catalyst in aqueous medium. The desired MBH adducts were obtained in up to 98&#8201;% yield. The synthetic applicability of the MBH adducts was demonstrated by the preparation of an acenaphtho[1,2&#8208;b]indole derivative.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acyl radical has assumed an eminent position in the synthetic chemistry due to its unique and often highly reactive nature. Using aldehyde as acyl radical source does not require the prefunctionalization of substrate. Furthermore, the formation of acyl radical can be achieved through a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process. In recent years, photochemical&#8208;, electrochemical&#8208;, and photoelectrochemical&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular HAT from aldehydes have been regarded as mild and sustainable routes for the generation of acyl radicals. Herein, we discuss some of the key advancements in the past 6 years in photo&#8208;, electro&#8208;, and photoelectro&#8208;catalyzed generation of acyl radicals from aldehydes and their utilization. We also highlight the mechanistic insights that have emerged from these transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Gem&#8208;Difluoroallylic Ketones Formation via Selective Carbonyl &#8211; C(sp3) Bond Cleavage of &#946;&#8208;Ketone Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and efficient method for constructing gem&#8208;difluoroallylic ketones via photo&#8208;induced selective carbonyl&#8722;C(sp3) bond cleavage of &#946;&#8208;ketone alcohols is reported. This method maintains excellent functional group tolerance and the resulting products can be readily transformed into other valuable chemical molecules. Moreover, mechanism studies indicate that this reaction initiates with a C&#8722;C bond &#946;&#8208;scission, generating carbon radicals through a PCET event.







Abstract
A photoinduced reaction for the formation of gem&#8208;difluoroallylic ketones via selective &#946;&#8208;scission of &#946;&#8208;ketone alcohols with &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes is described. This process demonstrates a broad substrate scope for both &#946;&#8208;ketone alcohols and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes. The reaction is proposed to proceed via an intramolecular PCET mechanism. The core of the strategy involves the oxidative cleavage of the carbonyl &#8211; C(sp3) bond in &#946;&#8208;ketone alcohols, facilitated by a base, to release acyl radicals, followed by the rapid addition of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes. Additionally, various downstream transformations were carried out with these compounds in a one&#8208;step operation. This protocol is also applicable to corresponding alkynylation and Minisci reactions.

         <title>S&#8208;Nucleophilic Imidazoline Ring Expansion: a Novel Approach to the Formation of Medium&#8208;Sized Thiolactames</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the formation of medium&#8208;sized heterocycles with a thioamide moiety has been developed. This is based on the expansion reaction of the imidazole ring under the action of an S&#8208;nucleophile.







Abstract
A novel method has been successfully developed for the synthesis of medium&#8208;sized heterocycles containing thioamide groups. This approach facilitates the expansion of the imidazoline moiety within the condensed ring system through the action of S&#8208;nucleophiles, enabling access to a broader and more diverse chemical space for natural product analogs and bioactive compounds. A series of [1,4,7]thia&#8208;(oxa&#8722;)diazecin&#8208;9&#8208;thiones were efficiently synthesized from diarene&#8208;fused [1.4]heteroazepines using this transformation, achieving yields ranging from 28&#8211;58&#8201;%.

         <title>Recent Advances in Diphenylmethanone Oxime Reagent Chemistry for Unsaturated Bond Bifunctionalization via Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The concurrent installation of C&#8208;X (C, O, S, N) and C&#8208;N bonds across unsaturated bond skeletons is an effective strategy for the preparation of ubiquitous motifs in pharmaceuticals and bioactive compounds. In recent years, the rapid development of bifunctionalization reactions has resulted in the emergence of bifunctional reagents as a research hotspot in this field. Among these, diphenylmethanone oxime reagents with highly active N&#8208;O bonds featuring low dissociation energy have significantly advanced the research of bifunctionalization. These reagents possess special features to simultaneously form two chemical bonds or introduce two functional groups, which not only streamlines synthetic pathways but also enhances synthetic efficiency, displaying an excellent atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy. In addition, diphenylmethanone oxime reagents have been extensively employed in organic synthesis, attributed to their ability to facilitate the construction of complex organic structures and to provide innovative reaction pathways. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of various diphenylmethanone oxime reagents and their applications in the bifunctional modification of unsaturated bonds through visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer catalysis (TTEnT).</dc:description>

         <title>Research Progress of Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;H Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past decade, rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H bond activation reactions have made significant progress and found broad applications in organic synthesis, biomedicine, and materials science. This is primarily attributed to their broad substrate scope, excellent functional group compatibility, and high reactivity. Currently, although considerable progress has been made, rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;H functionalization still heavily relies on directing groups to achieve selectivity, which significantly diminishes the reaction's efficiency. Additionally, the challenge of selectively functionalizing remote (meta/para) C&#8208;H bonds further complicates research in this field. In this review, we primarily focus on the research progress in rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;H functionalization from 2018 to 2024, categorizing reactions by type and providing a systematic overview of the mechanistic insights for each.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Starting materials for sustainable total synthesis often come from the chiral pool: carbohydrates, cyclitols, amino acids, and terpenes. In the terpene family, (&#8211;)&#8208;sclareol has served as a sustainable, readily available, and versatile chiral building block for the synthesis of numerous natural products. (&#8211;)&#8208;Sclareol possesses a unique structure that has consequently promoted its integration as a core framework within various structurally complex and biologically active substances, including sesquiterpenoids, diterpenoids, and sesterterpenoids. In fact, (&#8211;)&#8208;sclareol has facilitated access to diverse synthetic key intermediates, promoting the sustainable synthesis of several natural products. Herein, a critical and comprehensive review is presented covering the recent trends in sustainable total syntheses and the chiral pool approaches with emphasis on the synthesis of natural products through diverse synthetic routes employing (&#8211;)&#8208;sclareol as chiral educt.

         <title>Direct Reductive N&#8208;alkylation of Amines with Carboxylic Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report herein a facile direct method for the reductive N&#8208;alkylation of amines with carboxylic esters, using tert&#8208;butylmagnesium chloride (t&#8208;BuMgCl) as a mediator and Red&#8208;Al as the reducing agent, achieving up to 90&#8201;% yield and broad functional group tolerance. It has been successfully applied to synthesize cariprazine, an antipsychotic drug, showcasing its potential in complex amine synthesis.







Abstract
We report herein a facile direct method for the reductive N&#8208;alkylation of amines with carboxylic esters, using tert&#8208;butylmagnesium chloride (t&#8208;BuMgCl) as a mediator and Red&#8208;Al as the reducing agent. The direct amidation of esters with amines and t&#8208;BuMgCl generates the intermediate amides. Subsequently, without the need for isolation or purification, these intermediates reacted with Red&#8208;Al in the same reaction flask to generate amines up to 90&#8201;% yield. This process is characterized by the rapid reaction time, quantitative conversion, and broad ester scope with various functional groups. Notably, this method enables the successful transformation of amine with carboxylic esters to produce cariprazine, a pivotal antipsychotic drug substance.

         <title>DMAP&#8208;Catalyzed Efficient Diastereo&#8208; and Regioselective Synthesis of Isoxazolone&#8208;Based Bisspiroheterocyclic Oxindoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DMAP&#8208;catalyzed diastereoselective 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction of arylidene isoxazolones with N&#8208;(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl)isatin ketimines is reported, which provides an efficient access to spiro oxindole&#8208;pyrrolidine&#8208;isoxazolone derivatives bearing CF3 group and quaternary carbon stereocenters in good to high yields with excellent diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
A strategic approach to incorporate CF3 group into oxindoles, pyrrolidines, and isoxazolones to construct spiro heterocyclic skeletons with quaternary carbon stereocenters was developed. Using a DMAP catalyst under mild conditions, the controllable synthesis of spiro oxindole&#8208;pyrrolidine&#8208;isoxazoline derivatives was achieved via concerted 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions of arylidene isoxazolones with N&#8208;(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl)isatin ketimines. This method exhibits robust regioselectivity and provides a series of isoxazolone&#8208;based bispiro heterocycles in good to high yields (72&#8201;%&#8211;99&#8201;%) with excellent diastereoselectivity (in all cases &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr), offering new candidate compounds for drug screen.

         <title>Alkyne&#8208; and Azide&#8208;Functionalised Cyclophellitol Derivatives for Selective Glucuronidase Targeting</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epoxide and azidiride&#8208;functionalized sugar carbocycles can be powerful mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors, but can also be difficult to tune for specificity. We present here the synthesis of three glucuronic acid configured carbocycles functionalized with azides in place of oxygen 4 or alkynes on the aziridine, with the eventual aim of growing selectivity for heparanase.







Abstract
Heparanase is an endo&#8208;acting &#946;&#8208;glucuronidase responsible for the degradation of heparan sulfate structures in the extracellular matrix. The enzyme is found to be significantly upregulated in aggressive cancer types, aiding cell proliferation by liberation of growth factors, increasing angiogenesis and metastasis. Despite much interest in the development of inhibitors to control this activity, no compound targeting heparanase has yet been approved as a drug. While mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors derived from the natural product cyclophellitol are very potent enzyme inactivators through their reactive epoxide, one challenge in their development is in achieving selectivity for heparanase over related glycosidases while also maintaining a balance of appropriate pharmacological properties. We present here the synthesis of three cyclophellitol scaffolds presenting azide and alkyne handles at key positions, which are amenable to facile elaboration via copper&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions to aid in exploring the structure&#8208;activity relationship for selective inhibitors of heparanase.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Characterization of BODIPY based 1H&#8208;Tetrazole Ligands</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fluorescence active ligand system consisting of a BODIPY derivative, linked to a 1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl coordinating moiety via alkyl or benzyl spacers, is presented. The designed ligands exhibit remarkable emission properties even in solid state, which is complemented by crystal structure analysis. This enables future application of the ligands in various fields of coordination chemistry including spin&#8208;crossover photoluminescence coupled systems.







Abstract
Four novel fluorescence active ligands (1&#8211;4) consisting of a 1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl moiety as coordinating unit and a 4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene (BODIPY) derivative as fluorophore, bridged via alkyl (&#8208;(CH2)n&#8208;, n=1&#8211;3) or benzyl (&#8208;CH2&#8208;C6H4&#8208;) spacers were designed. Successful synthesis is demonstrated by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, as well as powder and single crystal XRD analysis. The methylene bridged ligand 2 (4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3,5,7&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;8&#8208;[(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methyl]&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene) crystallizes in different polymorphs and solvatomorphs, in contrast to the other three ligands, which show no polymorphism under identical conditions. Photophysical studies revealed high fluorescence quantum yields (69 &#8211; 95&#8201;%) in solution for the &#8208;(CH2)2&#8208; bridged ligand 3 (4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3,5,7&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;8&#8208;[(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethyl]&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene) and the &#8208;(CH2)3&#8208; bridged ligand 4 (4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3,5,7&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;8&#8208;[(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)propyl]&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene). Non&#8208;radiative decay due to rotational motion of the 1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208; and/or &#8208;CH2&#8208;C6H4&#8208; moiety for 2 and 1 (4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3,5,7&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;8&#8208;[4&#8208;((1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methyl)phenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene) respectively leads to reduced quantum yields of &#8805;35&#8201;%. Complete fluorescence quenching upon aggregation is prevented by installation of the sterically demanding 1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl moiety and a spacer in meso&#8208;position of the BODIPY core to elongate the intermolecular distances between two adjacent BODIPY cores. Detailed photophysical and crystallographic investigations are supported by theoretical calculations.

         <title>First Total Synthesis of Deinococcucin A, a Key Glycolipid Found in Cell Membranes of Extremophilic Bacteria</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first total synthesis of a glycolipid, deinococcucin A, isolated from a gut bacterium, member of extremophilic Deinococcus family. The synthesis started from N&#8208;acetylglucosamine, a sugar arising from chitin biomass, major constituent of crustacean's shell. The major difficulty was the synthesis of an &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amide moiety linked in alpha anomeric position of GlcNAc, which was efficiently obtained from the corresponding allyl group.







Abstract
Deinococcucin A is a secondary metabolite isolated from a gut bacteria of carpenter ant, member of extremophilic Deinoccocus family. The structure is a glycolipid containing N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine, linked in &#945; anomeric position to a chiral 2,3&#8208;dihydroxypropanamide moiety. We succeeded a new strategy starting directly from N&#8208;acetylglucosamine and transforming in an efficient manner an allyl group to the corresponding chiral &#945;&#8208;hydroxyamide. Three key steps were used: the oxidation of primary amine to nitrile using TCCA, as well as its hydrolysis to the corresponding amide using palladium (II) catalyzed conditions. The synthesis was completed in only 10 steps with an overall yield of 3&#8201;%.

         <title>Asymmetrically Fused Nanographene&#8208;Porphyrin Architectures</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenyl, pyrene, and hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) fragments are assembled around a central porphyrin core and interconnected under oxidative Scholl conditions to achieve the merging of the individual &#960;&#8208;systems. The three asymmetric porphyrin conjugates obtained this way exhibit intriguing optical features.







Abstract
A strategy to combine three standalone aromatic building blocks in one coherent, fully conjugated molecule is presented. Namely, benzene, pyrene, and hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) are assembled around a central porphyrin core in an ABAC type of geometry and interconnected under oxidative Scholl conditions to achieve merging of the individual &#960;&#8208;systems. The three asymmetric porphyrin conjugates obtained this way exhibit intriguing absorption features, namely strongly red&#8208;shifted and broadened spectra. The presented series of molecules demonstrates the ability to control and influence these optical properties with high precision by altering the size of the aromatic system in a controlled manner. Density functional theory calculations gave more profound insights into the electronic structure and optical transitions of the investigated fused architectures.

         <title>1,4&#8208;Dioxane as Precursor of &#8722;CH2CH2&#8722;: A Simple and Convenient Strategy to Synthesize 1,2&#8208;Disulfide Substituted Ethanes Initiated by Iodine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel precursor of &#8722;CH2CH2&#8722; has been achieved via the double C&#8722;O cleavage of 1,4&#8208;dioxane under the proton acid condition of HI. Control experiments suggest that 1,2&#8208;diiodoethane generated in&#8208;situ is crucial for the formation of the product. This protocol for the construction of various 1,2&#8208;disulfide substituted ethanes is very convenient and practical by its simple and mild conditions.







Abstract
An unprecedented I2&#8208;initiated nucleophilic ring opening reaction of 1,4&#8208;dioxane with thiols for the construction of various 1,2&#8208;disulfide substituted ethanes has been developed. Previously, dihalogenated ethane, acetylene or ethylene are often used as the pre&#8208;cursor of &#8722;CH2CH2&#8722;. Through the cleavage of two C&#8722;O bonds, 1,4&#8208;dioxane as precursor of &#8722;CH2CH2&#8722; has been achieved for the first time. In the presence of HI, thiols could be replaced by disulfides as nucleophile. This protocol is very convenient and practical by its simple and mild conditions.

         <title>Exploring the reactivity of (hetero)aryl amides in the Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam reaction with arylalkenyl boron reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of acetanilides and pyridyl acetamides is explored in the formation of a C&#8211;N bond through a Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam reaction yielding a wide scope of N&#8208;aryl E&#8208;enamides. The products obtained were applied in the synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycles via Heck reaction as proof of concept, illustrating the practical utility of the prepared N&#8208;aryl E&#8208;enamides.







Abstract
The unique reactivity and stability of enamides make them attractive reagents in organic synthesis. Herein, we investigated the reactivity of acetanilides and pyridyl acetamides in the formation of a C&#8722;N bond through a Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam reaction using arylalkenyl boron&#8208;based reagents yielding a wide scope of N&#8208;aryl enamides with an E configuration. The products obtained have been applied in the synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycles, an important scaffold in several biologically active compounds, via sequential Heck reaction to prove the practical utility of the prepared N&#8208;aryl enamides.

         <title>Immobilized Eosin Y on Modified Silica Nanoparticles and their Applications in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silica nanoparticles (SNPs) were synthesized, functionalized with amino groups and covalently linked to Eosin Y (EY) through amide bonds. The SNPs&#8208;EY photocatalyst was characterized by microscospy and spectroscopy techniques. It displayed efficient photocatalytic activity in oxidation, reduction, and energy transfer reactions, demonstrating its potential as a heterogeneous photocatalyst with superior catalytic performance compared to its homogeneous counterpart.







Abstract
The development of novel photocatalytic systems is crucial for advancing sustainable chemical processes in organic synthesis. In this study, we report the preparation, characterization, and application of a heterogeneous photocatalyst based on Eosin Y (EY) covalently immobilized on silica nanoparticles (SNPs). The SNPs&#8208;EY photocatalyst was thoroughly characterized using various techniques, including SEM, TEM, X&#8208;ray diffraction, UV&#8208;vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, solid&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy, XPS, FT&#8208;IR, TGA, and DLS. These analyses confirmed the successful immobilization of EY on SNPs and demonstrated the uniformity and favourable photophysical properties of the resulting hybrid material. The photocatalytic performance of SNPs&#8208;EY was evaluated in a series of model reactions, including aza&#8208;Henry reaction (cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling), reduction of nitrocompounds, and photooxidation of dimethylanthracene. The reaction results demonstrated that SNPs&#8208;EY is an effective and recyclable photocatalyst, offering yields comparable to or higher than those of homogeneous systems, while providing the advantages of easy separation and reuse. This study highlights the potential of SNPs&#8208;EY as a versatile photocatalyst for various organic transformations, promoting the advancement of green and sustainable chemistry.

         <title>Application of Laser&#8208;Generated Au&#8208;Ag/Al2O3 Nanoparticle Catalysts for the Selective Catalytic Oxidation of 5&#8208;(Hydroxymethyl) Furfural to 2,5&#8208;Furan&#8208;Dicarboxylic Acid</title>

         <dc:description>
With reference to the sustainability and green synthesis towards biomass valorization, we report highly active and selective oxidation of the renewable feedstock HMF (78&#8201;% conversion) into the commercially important chemical FDCA (80&#8201;% selectivity) by implying specially designed and synthesized bimetallic AuAg nanoparticle catalysts supported on Al2O3 by laser ablation under mild basic conditions.







Abstract
Conversion of lignocellulosic biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;(Hydroxymethyl) furfural (HMF) into 2,5&#8208;Furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) has a high potential to replace petroleum&#8208;based feedstocks for the production of plastics. In this study, a green synthesis strategy for the selective oxidation of HMF to FDCA is reported by using laser&#8208;generated and specifically designed bimetallic AuAg nanoparticle catalysts supported on Al2O3 using molecular oxygen as oxidant and water as a solvent. Although supported AuAg catalysts are already known as suitable catalysts for this reaction, the optimal reaction conditions (type of base, reaction temperature, oxygen pressure), Au&#8201;:&#8201;Ag composition, role of metal&#8208;support effects and origin of the active site still remain under debate. Interestingly, an Au9Ag1/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited the highest activity with a FDCA yield of up to 66&#8201;% at 80&#8201;% HMF conversion. Hereby, NaHCO3 (instead of NaOH) as a smoother base in 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 base:HMF ratio, low oxygen pressures of 5&#8197;bar, and a mild temperature of 150&#8201;&#176;C were found optimal. The yield remained fairly stable on reuse of the catalyst for 3 cycles without hints of catalyst sintering or leaching. The titration of surficial hydroxyls on the AuxAgy/Al2O3 surface showed the highest density of acidic hydroxyls for the most active Au9Ag1/Al2O3 catalyst. The respective hydroxyls potentially originate from metal&#8208;support interactions between the AuAg nanoparticles with the alumina support and act as Lewis acidic sites that oxidize the alcohol moiety of HMF to form FDCA with high selectively. In summary, this study shows that the catalytic activity of AuAg catalysts in HMF oxidation is not just linked to an alloying effect but also to a metal&#8208;support effect where the AuAg nanoparticles appear to directly affect the local acidity of the support.

         <title>Photolabile ortho&#8208;Nitro&#8208;Benzyl Carbonate as an Amino Protecting Group for Stereocontrolled Synthesis of 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;2&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;Glycosides</title>

         <dc:description>
The photolabile ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl carbonate (oNBC) was described as an amino protecting group for stereocontrolled synthesis of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glycosides. Under irradiation at 365&#8197;nm, deprotection of the multiple O&#8208; and N&#8208;oNBC protecting groups of glycosides was effectively achieved with aminomethyl polystyrene (P&#8208;CH2NH2) as the carbonyl scavenger.







Abstract
Traditional amino protecting groups are often removed under harsh conditions or incompatible with other protecting groups, rendering the synthesis of complex 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glycosides difficult. Here, we utilize the photolabile ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl carbonate (oNBC) as an amino protecting group for stereocontrolled synthesis of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glycosides. The gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation with per&#8208;O&#8208;oNBC&#8208;protected 2&#8208;N&#8208;phthaloyl (Phth)&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;, 2&#8208;N&#8208;trichloroacetyl (TCA)&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;, and 2&#8208;N&#8208;oNBC&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;glycosyl ynenoates proceeded smoothly to provide 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy glycosides with exclusive &#946;&#8208;selectivities via the neighboring group participation (NGP) effect. Removal of the multiple O&#8208; and N&#8208;oNBC protecting groups of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy glycosides was achieved under irradiation at 365&#8197;nm with aminomethyl polystyrene as the carbonyl scavenger.

         <title>(3+3)&#8208;Annulation of 2&#8208;Mercaptobenzimidazoles With &#945;&#8208;(Trifluoromethyl)Styrene Under Ultrasonic Irradiation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This protocol developed (3+3)&#8208;annulation of 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazoles with &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)styrene under ultrasonic irradiation. The cyclized product was formed through the Michael addition and intramolecular substitution reaction successively. The pure products were obtained with simple recrystallization.







Abstract
A rapid and facile sonochemical route for the [3+3] annulation of 2&#8208;mercapto benzimidazoles with &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)styrene was reported for the synthesis of fluorinated benzo[4,5]imidazo[2,1&#8208;b][1,3]thiazines. The reaction proceeds through the SN2/SNV pathway while the selective SN2 pathway is completely inhibited. The developed method is effective with a wide range of substrates, tolerating diverse functional groups. The pure products are obtained with high yield (up to 92&#8201;%) directly via recrystallization without column chromatography. Furthermore, applying sonochemical methodology reduces the reaction time and eliminates the need for expensive photocatalysts, ligands or oxidants.

         <title>Synthesis, Structures, and Physical Properties of ExTTF Substituted with Aryl Groups through Sulfur Bridges and the Electron Transfers with C60</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four molecular tweezers with good electron donor ability were synthesized and fully characterized. The UV&#8208;Vis absorption studies showed that intermolecular electron transfer existed between compounds 1&#8211;4 and C60.







Abstract
ExTTF derivatives (1&#8211;4) bearing aryl groups attached through sulfur bridges have been synthesized. The peripheral aryl groups have a certain influence on both the electronic and crystallographic properties of the exTTFs. Compounds 1&#8211;4 show two bands typical of exTTF derivatives near 360 and 430&#8197;nm. Compound 1 and 4 exhibit the characteristic electrochemical exTTF behavior, with one reversible two&#8208;electron process ranging depending on their substitution the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability. But 2 and 3 exhibit a similar single two&#8208;electron oxidation wave but electrochemically irreversible redox with peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak potential separation. And 3 has a low redox potential, which is significantly inconsistent with the electron absorption of pyridine substituents. The crystal structures of 1&#8211;4 exhibit the characteristic butterfly shape. Moreover, the peripheral aryl groups exhibit multiple alignment modes with respect to the central exTTF core, caused by their rotation about the two C&#8722;S bonds of the sulfur bridges. Under the interaction of multiple molecules, exTTF shows different molecular packing structures. Compounds 1&#8211;4 have charge transfer with C60 due to their good electron&#8208;donating ability, butterfly configuration, and free rotation of peripheral aryl groups. These results indicate that 1&#8211;4 organic electronic materials have potential applications in the field of supramolecular assembly.

         <title>Recent Developments in the Photochemical Reactions of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent times, photo&#8208;redox catalysis has emerged as a valuable tool in organic transformations owing to its environmentally friendly nature and utilization of abundant resources. This paper provides an overview of organic transformations achieved through metal and non&#8208;metallic photocatalysts or even without the necessity of photocatalysts from 2019 to 2024.







Abstract
The adoption of clean and renewable light sources is becoming increasingly prevalent in organic synthesis due to their welfare, workability and economic benefits. In recent times, photo&#8208;redox catalysis has emerged as a valuable tool in organic transformations owing to its environmentally friendly nature and utilization of abundant resources. Since harmful or polluting reagents are not needed for the organic photochemical reactions, these reactions provide insights into sustainable processes and green chemistry. N&#8208;Heterocyclic compounds (NHC's) constitute fundamental structural motifs in numerous organic compounds and are widely encountered in natural products and pharmaceuticals with diverse biological activities. Consequently, investigations into the synthesis and modification of these NHC's such as indole, carbazole, benzimidazole, quinoline, isoquinoline and pyridine hold particular significance for chemists and pharmacologists. This review provides an overview of the impact of photocatalysis on synthesis of NHC's and their modification from 2019 to 2024. These transformations are achieved through the utilization of both metal photocatalysts (e.&#8201;g., Ir, Pd, Co, Gd etc.) and non&#8208;metallic photocatalysts (e.&#8201;g., Eosin&#8208;Y, 4CzIPN, Mes&#8208;Acr+ClO4&#8722; etc.), or even without the necessity of photocatalysts. It is anticipated that this review will serve as a valuable resource for researchers delving into the promising realm of photocatalyzed transformations.

         <title>Amination of Alkylboronic Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkylboronic esters are high value chemical building blocks which can be used to make complex, C&#8208;sp3 rich molecules. The ability to convert the C&#8208;B bond in a range of C&#8208;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions, in addition to their broad functional group compatibility, gives alkylboronic esters significant synthetic utility. Methods to convert boronic esters into amines have particular interest, due to the wide prevalence of nitrogen&#8208;based functional groups in biologically active compounds, functional materials, and catalysts. In this review, we explore different methods for the amination of alkylboronic esters. These can be split into three distinct classes based on the mechanism of reaction: amination through 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangement, amination using nucleophilic &#8216;ate&#8217; complexes, and oxidative amination reactions such as alkyl variants of the Chan&#8208;Lam reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Photooxidation of Polystyrene into High&#8208;Value Chemicals</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an overview of recent studies in the photooxidative degradation of polystyrene into benzoyl compounds. It includes a comparative analysis of various degradation methods, highlighting their effectiveness and efficiency. Additionally, the review discusses the underlying mechanisms involved in the degradation process and addresses the challenges that remain in this field.







Abstract
Plastics play a crucial role in the survival and advancement of human civilization. However, the increasing challenge of plastic pollution presents significant obstacles. Disposal methods such as incineration and landfilling result in substantial resource wastage and pose potential environmental hazards. The slow progress in recycling and reusing waste plastics hinders their industrial application and effective response to environmental crises. Photocatalysis offers promising solutions for the future of plastic recycling, particularly with the recent increase in photocatalytic degradation methods for polystyrene (PS). This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in the photooxidation of PS into high&#8208;value chemicals.

A wide range of structurally diverse diazo reagents (including heterocyclic ones) as well as tetrazoles with different substituents in the fifth position have been used to prepare 2,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole derivatives in good and high yields and with high regioselectivity. It is shown that the regioselectivity of the reaction can decrease in the presence of electron withdrawing groups in the tetrazole, as well as in the presence of protic acids.

         <title>Tandem, Catalyst&#8208;Free C&#8722;C Synthesis of Nitriles from Aldehydes and Methyl Cyanoacetate with Sodium Hypophosphite</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we have reported a reaction that allows performing a Knoevenagel condensation, its adduct reduction, and subsequent decarboxylation in a single preparative step using cheap, stable, and convenient sodium hypophosphite. No metal catalyst is required. The reaction is scalable. The limitations of the method are also described in the paper.







Abstract
Saturated carbon chain elongation is a common refrain in numerous synthetic pathways. While the formation of C&#8722;C single bonds is of primary importance in organic synthesis, the simultaneous introduction of functional groups such as nitrile or ester can reasonably increase its practical utility for the preparation of multifunctional products. The Knoevenagel reaction is a powerful tool to create carbon backbones of organic molecules; however, it requires subsequent reduction and/or decarboxylation to achieve a product with a saturated carbon chain. Herein we report a convenient one&#8208;step protocol for the reductive condensation between methyl cyanoacetate and aldehydes in the presence of stable, ecologically benign, cheap and available in bulk amounts sodium hypophosphite as a reductant. A description of both the reaction capabilities and limitations is given in this paper.

         <title>Construction of Sulfur(IV)&#8208;Chiral Six&#8208;Membered Heterocycles by Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric (4+2) Dipolar Cyclization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric (4+2) cyclization was disclosed, providing a modular platform for the synthesis of chiral sulfur(IV)&#8208;containing six&#8208;membered heterocycles. These products enable the enantioselective preparation of a variety of other S&#8208;stereogenic derivatives.







Abstract
Chiral sulfur&#8208;containing compounds play an important role in asymmetric catalysis and synthesis, chiral pharmaceuticals, and chiral materials. While great progress has been made in the synthesis of these compounds, the asymmetric catalytic synthesis of chiral sulfur&#8208;containing heterocycles remains relatively limited compared to acyclic ones. In this study, we successfully report an efficient and highly selective synthesis of structurally diverse chirality&#8208;at&#8208;sulfur(IV) six&#8208;membered heterocycles under mild conditions via a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric (4+2) dipolar cyclization. More importantly, these products enable the enantioselective preparation of a variety of other S&#8208;stereogenic derivatives.

         <title>Photocatalytic Cascade Trifluoromethylation/Cyclization: Selective Synthesis of Trifluoroethylated Benzopyran and Benzopyranone Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic radical cascade cyclization reaction has been developed that enables the one&#8208;step synthesis of rare trifluoroethyl benzopyran derivatives with a wide variety of structures in excellent yields. This oxidant&#8208;free protocol offers several other advantages, including low catalyst loading, high regioselectivity, broad substrate scope, excellent functional group tolerance, and operational simplicity.







Abstract
We have realized a photocatalytic radical cascade cyclization reaction enabling the one&#8208;step synthesis of rare trifluoroethyl benzopyran derivatives with a wide variety of structures in excellent yields. Furthermore, the approach exhibits low catalyst loading, high regioselectivity and wide applicability under mild conditions. The selectivity of this transformation is influenced by the length of the carbon chain of the benzaldehyde, as demonstrated by density functional theory calculations. Additionally, scaling up the photocatalytic process can be readily accomplished.

         <title>Aryl Radicals Generated from Aryl Pinacol Boronates Modify Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl pinacol boronates generate aryl radicals under aqueous conditions. The formed aryl radicals can be used to functionalize peptide disulfides yielding&#160;S&#8208;arylated products, but they react readily with proteins as well competing with Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling used in bioorthogonal chemical biology applications. The overall reaction does not rely on metal, electro&#8208; or photocatalysis, and reflects the tunable Lewis acidity of organoboronates.







Abstract
We report here a distinct reaction, which generates aryl radicals from aryl pinacol boronates under mild aqueous conditions and can be used for peptide and protein modifications. The strategy leverages the versatile reactivity of aryl pinacol boronates to form aryl radicals in presence of ammonium persulfate (APS). The formed aryl radicals insert readily into peptide disulfide bonds while tolerating other functionalities. On the protein level, the reactivity extends beyond the disulfide bonds. The methodology benefits from the accessibility of starting aryl pinacol boronates, as well as biocompatible conditions. In contrast to conventional methods used for aryl radical generation, the strategy is metal&#8208;free, does not require photoinduction and can be readily performed under aqueous conditions. The mechanism of the reactions was investigated by radical&#8208;trapping experiments, spectroscopic analysis and oxygen scavenging. The presented approach broadens the application of aryl pinacol boronate esters in radical reactions.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular [5+2] Cycloaddition: Highly Regioselective Synthesis of Allene&#8208;Containing 2&#8208;Benzoxepines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the synthesis of allene&#8208;containing 2&#8208;benzoxepines has been developed on the basis of palladium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular [5+2] cycloaddition. The synthetic approach features ready substrate availability, broad substrate scope, satisfactory yields and excellent regioselectivity.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular [5+2] cycloaddition of propargylic carbonates with benzyl allenyl ethers has been developed for the synthesis of allene&#8208;containing 2&#8208;benzoxepines. The reaction proceeds by a pathway involving decarboxylative allenylpalladium formation, regioselective intermolecular insertion, and intramolecular nucleophilic attack. In this way, the sequential formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O bonds results in the generation of a 2&#8208;benzoxepine skeleton in a one&#8208;pot process.

         <title>Highly Diastereoselective Radical Cyclopropanation of Olefins via Cobaloxime&#8208;Based Metalloradical Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobaloxime complexes catalyze highly diastereoselective radical cyclopropanation of olefins with &#945;&#8208;aryl diazoacetates under mild conditions and low catalyst loading. A broad substrate scope including biologically active molecules is tolerated with high yields. This method is also amenable for gram&#8208;scale reactions, showcasing the application of cobaloxime&#8208;catalyzed metalloradical catalysis (MRC) in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Metalloradical catalysis (MRC), predominantly exemplified by metalloporphyrin complexes, has emerged as a promising strategy for regulating radical reactions and broadening their synthetic applications. In this paper, we report that cobaloxime complexes, functioning as a surrogate for metalloporphyrin systems, can mediate radical cyclopropanation of olefins using donor/acceptor&#8208;type carbene precursor &#945;&#8208;aryl diazoacetates through the MRC process. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, yielding cyclopropane derivatives in good yields with high diastereoselectivity. The reaction exhibits extensive substrate tolerance, encompassing gram&#8208;scale transformations and the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. Our discoveries underscore the potential of cobaloxime&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation as a valuable asset in organic syntheses and further expand the repertoire of metalloradical systems in catalysis.

         <title>Xanthone Synthesis through Catalysis: Exploring the Green Limits of Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Methods</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores recent advancements in the synthesis of xanthones, focusing on the transition from stoichiometric to catalytic methodologies, including homogeneous and heterogeneous approaches. Key environmental metrics, solvent selection, and reaction steps, among others, are analysed, showcasing the potential of modern catalytic techniques to develop greener synthetic processes.







Abstract
The transition from traditional stoichiometric methods to catalytic processes has significantly advanced the synthesis of xanthones, privileged structures with diverse biological activities. This review critically examines various homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic methodologies, emphasising their efficiency, and adherence to green chemistry principles. Through comparative analysis of key metrics such as Reaction Mass Efficiency (RME), Process Mass Intensity (PMI), E&#8208;factor, and Turnover Number (TON), we highlight the superior performance of heterogeneous catalysts, which demonstrate high reusability, selectivity, and minimal waste generation. The choice of solvent, a crucial factor in the environmental footprint of these processes, is also assessed, focusing on greener alternatives. The robust nature and economic viability of heterogeneous catalysts make them ideal for large&#8208;scale applications, offering suitable solutions for more environmentally&#8208;friendly xanthone production. Furthermore, the reduction in by&#8208;products and the importance of catalyst purity in pharmaceutical applications are discussed, underscoring the relevance of these advancements in meeting the rigorous standards of the industry. This review provides valuable insights into the ongoing evolution of catalytic strategies in xanthone synthesis, driving future developments in medicinal chemistry and green chemistry.

         <title>Scandium&#8208;Catalyzed Fischer Indole Synthesis: A Highly Efficient Construction of Complicated Indoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report an efficient scandium&#8208;catalytic reaction protocol for the classical Fischer indole synthesis, which can tolerate a wide variety of polycyclic substrates and allow us to easily construct complex indole structures in high yields for most cases. Moreover, in order to demonstrate the reaction efficacy, we also synthesized two quinazolinone&#8208;containing natural alkaloids, their analog, as well as an anticancer indenoindolone compound.

         <title>Assembly of Thiazino[3,4&#8208;a]Isoquinoline and Thiazepino[5,4&#8208;a]Isoquinoline Frameworks from Isoquinolinium 1,4&#8208;Zwitterionic Thiolates Through [5+1] and [5+2] Cycloaddition Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>
Using &#945;&#8208;bromo ketones and acetylenedicarboxylate as the respective reactive partners, the [5+1] and [5+2] cycloaddition reactions with isoquinolinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolates facilitate the construction of isoquinoline&#8208;fused thiazine and seven&#8208;membered N, S&#8208;heterocyclic frameworks under mild conditions. This cycloaddition approach exhibits exceptional substrate versatility and tolerance towards diverse functional groups.







Abstract
Two cycloaddition modes of isoquinolinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolates have been established. Upon choosing &#945;&#8208;bromo ketones as the counterpart, a range of isoquinoline&#8208;fused thiazines can be attained with yields ranging from moderate to excellent through a formal [5+1] reaction pathway, exhibiting remarkable substrate adaptability and resilience to diverse functional groups. Additionally, a library of unprecedented thiazepino[5,4&#8208;a]isoquinolines, a novel category of seven&#8208;membered heterocycles, has been synthesized via a [5+2] pathway utilizing acetylenedicarboxylate as the reactive component. Notably, this reaction process stands out for its exceptional 100&#8201;% atomic utilization efficiency.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C4,C5&#8208;Diarylation of Isoxazole&#8208;3&#8208;Carboxylate by Double C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization</title>

         <dc:description>
Conditions for the palladium&#8208;catalyzed C4,C5&#8208;diarylation of ethyl isoxazole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylate through double C&#8722;H bond activation are reported. This methodology, which employs commercially available substrates, an inexpensive base and an air&#8208;stable catalyst, provides simple one&#8208;pot access to a wide variety of C4,C5&#8208;diarylated isoxazoles, allowing straightforward tuning of their properties.







Abstract
The Pd&#8208;catalyzed C4&#8208;arylation of 3,5&#8208;disubstituted isoxazoles via C&#8722;H bond functionalization has been largely described. By contrast, the reactivity of isoxazoles in C&#8722;H bond functionalization with both unsubstituted C4 and C5 positions remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report on the reactivity in Pd&#8208;catalyzed double C&#8722;H bond arylation of an isoxazole with unsubstituted C4 and C5 positions. Conditions for the palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct C4,C5&#8208;diarylation of ethyl isoxazole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylate using aryl bromides as the aryl source are reported. This procedure tolerates several useful substituents on the aryl bromide such as nitrile, acetyl, formyl, benzoyl, alkoxycarbonyl, chloro, fluoro, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, cyanomethyl, tertbutyl and methoxy at para&#8208; and meta&#8208;positions. Conversely, with ortho&#8208;substituted aryl bromides, mixtures of mono&#8208; and di&#8208;arylated isoxazoles were generally obtained. This methodology provides a simple one pot access to a wide variety of C4,C5&#8208;diarylated isoxazoles from commercially available substrates allowing to modify easily their biological properties.

         <title>An Oxidative SNH Alkylamination of 5(6,7,8)&#8208;Nitroquinoline N&#8208;Oxides in Aqueous Dioxane Medium</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel approach to synthesize otherwise inaccessible 2&#8208;alkylaminoquinoline derivatives in moderate to excellent yields. The reaction is based on direct oxidative substitution of hydrogen and, unusually for a Chichibabin reaction, proceeds easily under mild conditions and in an aqueous environment. The synthesis is scalable. Some products were investigated for their antibacterial activity.







Abstract
A novel and efficient method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;alkylamino and 2&#8208;dialkylamino derivatives of N&#8208;oxides of 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, 7&#8208; and 8&#8208;nitroquinolines, which can potentially exhibit biological activity, as containing a pharmacophoric quinoline fragment, is described herein. The reactions of 5(6,7,8)&#8208;nitroquinoline N&#8208;oxides with various primary or secondary amines in the presence of potassium ferricyanide at in aqueous dioxane medium afforded the corresponding secondary and tertiary amines in moderate to excellent yields. This reaction is the first example of a Chichibabin reaction leading to the formation of 2&#8208;alkylaminoquinoline derivatives at position 2 under mild conditions. A study of the antibacterial activity of some products was carried out.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Multipath Compact Cyclophanes for Quantum Interference Studies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic model compounds with two parallel conductance paths are reported. Preliminary single molecule transport studies reflect the impact of substitution patterns of the different pathways. From a synthetic viewpoint interesting, the fragility of the thiophene model compounds required the consideration of alternative protection group strategies.







Abstract
To investigate interference phenomena and conductance properties in mechanically controlled break junctions (MCBJs), macrocycles 1 and 2 (BMCs: for BenzeneMacroCycles), containing a meta&#8208;substituted benzene moiety with solubilizing tert&#8208;butyl groups, as well as structures 3 and 4 (TMCs: for ThiopheneMacroCycles), featuring 2,5&#8208;connected 3,4&#8208;hexyl&#8208;thiophene corners, were synthesized. Macrocycles 1 and 2 respectively 3 and 4 differ in the positions of the acetyl&#8208;protected sulfur anchoring groups, which impacts both, the individual transport efficiency of their parallel electronic pathways and their overall molecular wire lengths. All macrocycles were synthesized based on a series of Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reactions. For 3 and 4, a 2&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridinyl)ethyl protecting group for the sulfur atoms was successful, while for macrocycles 1 and 2 the more common tert&#8208;butyl protecting group did the job. To our delight, proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept charge transport studies conducted in an MCBJ setup demonstrated the expected trends regarding improved conductance intensities for the TMCs compared to the BMCs. Furthermore, the corresponding molecular plateaus from the breaking experiments were in the expected length range of the S&#8722;S distances for all compounds. We also found that the overall conductance seems to follow a more complex transport mechanism than just the sum of contributions from both channels.

We also found that the overall conductance seems to follow a more complex transport mechanism than just the sum of contributions from both channels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structurally Innovative Benzimidazole&#8208;fused Ionic Organoselenium Compounds: Prevalence of Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N/Se Chalcogen Bonds with the Selenocyanate Receptor</title>

Chalcogen Bond. Presence of Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N or Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se chalcogen bonds are highlighted in the structurally innovative benzimidazole&#8208;fused cyclic selenazonium selenocyanates, cyclic selenazinium selenocyanates and the acyclic benzimidazolium analogs having two different types of selenocyanate units. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures of the compounds revealed the participation of both N and Se atoms of the SeCN counterions as ChB acceptors in building the Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N or Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se ChB interactions.







Abstract
The non&#8208;covalent interactions in molecules play important roles towards their applications in various aspects such as molecular recognition, catalysis, supramolecular chemistry, structural biology, pharmacology etc. Interestingly, among various non&#8208;bonding interactions, chalcogen bonding (ChB) has been extensively studied in different facets of crystal engineering over the last several years. The present study demonstrates the presence of Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N or Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se ChB in the benzimidazole&#8208;fused cyclic selenazonium selenocyanates (6&#8211;8), cyclic selenazinium selenocyanates (9&#8211;10) and the acyclic benzimidazolium analogs having two different types of selenocyanate units (11&#8211;12). The final organoselenium compounds were synthesized from benzimidazole in several steps in reasonably good yields. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures of the compounds revealed that both the N atom and Se atom of the negatively charged SeCN unit act as ChB acceptors in building the Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N or Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se ChB interactions along with the additional hydrogen bonding (HB) interactions. Moreover, the structural optimization and natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses were carried out using density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the natural charges on different Se centers and the strength of second&#8208;order perturbation energy (E2) for the ChB interactions. Finally, surface electrostatic potential (SEP) of the compounds was developed to visualize the formation of &#963;&#8208;holes.

         <title>Construction of Spiro Systems from Tetrathiafulvalene Derivatives by a Pinacol&#8208;Like Rearrangement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pinacol&#8208;like rearrangement of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives was found to yield spiro compounds under mild conditions with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine oxide (TEMPO) as a key reagent. The influence of various substituents was examined, and the mechanism was analyzed in detail. The findings highlight the broad applicability and selectivity of this transformation, offering valuable insight for the design of new TTF&#8208;based molecules.







Abstract
An efficient and generalized pinacol&#8208;like rearrangement of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives has been achieved using 2, 2, 6, 6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine oxide (TEMPO) as a key reagent, in place of a traditional metal catalyst. Examination of numerous TTF derivatives demonstrates the reaction's exceptional tolerance to a variety of substituents, achieving an overall yield of up to 97&#8201;%. The optimization of reaction conditions and evaluation of reaction applicability were achieved by varying factors such as the first redox potentials (E11/2) of the substrate molecule, substituent type, substituent position, number of substituents, and structural symmetry. Additionally, the reaction mechanism was explored using isotopic labeling, real&#8208;time monitoring UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Specifically, TTF is oxidized to TTF+&#8901; by p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH&#8901;H2O). TTF+&#8901; subsequently reacts with TEMPO and H2O to form a pinacol&#8208;like intermediate, which undergoes a rearrangement to release a 2, 2, 6, 6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;ol (TEMPOH) molecule, forming the rearranged product as a hydrogenated cation, this intermediate undergoes deprotonation, leading to the formation of the final spiro product. This investigation led to the identification of a class of reactions for the efficient conversion of TTF derivatives into their spiro products via pinacol&#8208;like rearrangement reaction.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Axially Diaryl Aldehydes by Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Desymmetrization Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axially chiral biaryl aldehydes are esteemed as valuable precursors for the development of innovative chiral catalysts, playing a pivotal role across a broad spectrum of research disciplines.The synthesis of axially chiral biaryl aldehydes with various structural features has been developed by reacting biaryl dialdehyde with aromatic amine in the presence of chiral phosphoric acid (CPA). It shows excellent enantioselectivity, mild conditions and good compatibility with different functional groups. These structures serve as promising precursors for a range of subsequent chemical transformations and are likely to have potential applications in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral ligands or catalysts.







Abstract
Axially chiral biaryl aldehydes are precursors for the synthesis of axially chiral compounds and novel chiral catalysts of great interest, which play vital roles in extensive research fields. However, limited strategies exist for the efficient synthesis of axially chiral aldehydes, and the construction of structurally diverse axially chiral aldehydes remains challenging. Herein, a strategy is reported for the synthesis of biaryl axially chiral aldehydes with varying structures from biaryl dialdehydes and aromatic amines in the presence of a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst. This protocol features excellent enantioselectivity, mild conditions, and good functional&#8208;group tolerance.

         <dc:description>
Herein, we develop an efficient approach to the chemical synthesis of well&#8208;defined &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;mannurarate di&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, hexa&#8208; and octasaccharides with purported anti&#8208;Alzheimer's activity, utilizing N&#8208;phenyl trifluoroacetimidate donors and thioglycoside acceptors for the stereoselective assembly of the desired &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;mannuronate linkages.







Abstract
Sodium oligomannate, a sophisticated mixture of acidic linear &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;oligomannurarate ranging from dimers to decamers with an average molecular weight of 670&#8764;880&#8197;Da, has gained conditional approval for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we develop an efficient approach to the chemical synthesis of well&#8208;defined &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;mannurarate di&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, hexa&#8208; and octasaccharides (1&#8211;4), utilizing N&#8208;phenyl trifluoroacetimidate donors and thioglycoside acceptors for the stereoselective assembly of the desired &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;mannuronate linkages. This approach features a straightforward protecting group strategy with only two types of protecting groups: tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) for the 4&#8208;OH at the non&#8208;reducing end and benzyl (Bn) for free hydroxyl and carboxylic acid moieties, thereby ensuring the stereoselective formation of the &#946;&#8208;mannosyl bonds and facilitating sequential transformation into the target &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;mannurarate oligosaccharides. The scalability of the present synthesis of these oligosaccharides paves the way for in&#8208;depth structure&#8208;activity relationship studies and pharmacological investigations of sodium oligomannates.

         <title>NHC&#8208;Catalyzed, Microwave&#8208;Assisted and Base&#8208;Dependent Reactions of Substituted Cinnamaldehydes Towards &#947;&#8208;Lactones or Saturated Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
10 NHCs were used as organocatalysts using microwacve irradiation and depending on the base used to generate the free carbene, &#947;&#8208;lactones or saturated esters were prepared from aryl&#8208;substituted cinnamaldehydes. Novel NHC hydrochloride salts and &#947;&#8208;lactones are reported together with the optimum reaction conditions and the broad scope of both reactions.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) generated from imidazolium, imidazopyridinium and imidazoquinolinium hydrochlorides in&#8197;situ using base and microwave irradiation were employed as organocatalysts to yield homoenolates from cinnamaldehyde and its aryl&#8208;substituted analogs. Depending on the catalytic base either &#947;&#8208;lactones were prepared when the strong base tBuOK was used or the corresponding saturated ethyl 3&#8208;aryl propionates were synthesized with the milder DIPEA base. Novel imidazopyridinium and imidazoquinolinium hydrochlorides were synthesized and were compared to commercially available NHCs IMes and IDip for their catalytic activity. The optimum reaction conditions were established using IMes and the broad scope of both reactions was investigated using the 4 most efficient NHCs.

         <title>Convergent Synthesis of Antitumor Aplysiatoxin Derivatives Based on a Combination of Ring&#8208;Closing and Cross Metathesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated a convergent synthesis of aplysiatoxin analogs based on a combination of ring&#8208;closing and cross metathesis. Synthetic analogs with different side chains revealed that a naphthol moiety did not improve binding to protein kinase C (PKC)&#8208;C1 domains, suggesting that the hydrogen bonding of the hydroxy group with the PKC&#8722;C1 domains may be more important than the CH/&#960; interaction.







Abstract
We investigated a convergent synthesis of aplysiatoxin analogs based on a combination of ring&#8208;closing and cross metathesis. The route provided four analogs (3&#8201;a&#8211;d) with different side chains to determine the CH/&#960; interaction with protein kinase C (PKC)&#8208;C1 domains. Biochemical evaluation revealed that a naphthol moiety did not improve binding to PKC&#8722;C1 domains, suggesting that the hydrogen bonding of the hydroxy group with the PKC&#8722;C1 domains may be more important than the CH/&#960; interaction.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, Spectral and Redox Properties of Phenoxazine Embedded Heteroporphyrins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenoxazine embedded heteroporphyrins containing one phenoxazine, two pyrroles and one heterocycle (furan, thiophene, selenophene or telluorophene) connected by four meso carbon atoms were synthesized, and their structure and electronic properties were compared with those of previously reported phenothiazine embedded heteroporphyrins.







Abstract
A series of phenoxazine embedded heteroporphyrins containing one phenoxazine, two pyrroles and one heterocycle, such as furan, thiophene, selenophene and telluorophene, connected by four meso carbon atoms were synthesized by condensing one equivalent of phenoxazine&#8208;based tripyrrane with one equivalent of the appropriate 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl&#8208;p&#8208;tolyl) heterocycle under acid&#8208;catalyzed conditions, and their structure, spectral and electrochemical properties were compared with those of previously reported phenothiazine embedded heteroporphyrins. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the phenoxazine embedded selenoporphyrin revealed that the selenophene ring, which is opposite the phenoxazine moiety, points outward from the macrocyclic core, and the phenoxazine unit deviated by an angle of 39.47&#176; from the mean plane defined by the four meso carbons atoms. The replacement of the phenothiazine unit in phenothiazine embedded heteroporphyrins with a phenoxazine unit led to significant alteration of the electronic properties of the macrocycles, as reflected in their spectral and electrochemical properties. The absorption spectra of phenoxazine embedded heteroporphyrins showed bathochromically shifted absorption bands, hypsochromically shifted fluorescence bands with decent quantum yields, more facile oxidation and more difficult reduction as compared to the corresponding phenothiazine embedded heteroporphyrins. DFT and TD&#8208;DFT studies were in support of the experimental observations.

         <title>Relative Stability and Basicity of Enamines from Aminocatalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relative stability of two series of enamines was examined using DFT (mainly M06&#8208;2X), MP2, and CCSD(T) calculations. A basicity scale for enamines derived from pyrrolidine and carbonyl compounds was then established. Another basicity scale was obtained for a second series of enamines, from propanal and various aminocatalysts.







Abstract
The relative thermodynamic stability of two series of enamines has been examined using DFT (mainly M06&#8208;2X), MP2, and CCSD(T) calculations, supplemented by 1H NMR spectroscopy in some cases. The basicity of enamines derived from pyrrolidine and various carbonyl compounds has been computationally compared in the gas phase and in water; the results indicate which enamines or iminium ions may predominate in nonpolar and polar acidic media when pyrrolidine and two or more carbonyl groups or carbonyl compounds are present in the reaction flask. The relative basicity of a second series of enamines, from propanal and chiral pyrrolidines or imidazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones, has also been investigated; this sheds light on the main intermediates that should be expected when two or more secondary amines are present in acid&#8208;catalyzed aldehyde reactions. Non&#8208;covalent interactions explain the stability of folded side&#8208;chain conformers of O&#8208;silylated prolinol enamines, according to the predictions of M06&#8211;2X, &#969;B97X&#8722;D, and B3LYP&#8722;D3 (but not B3LYP). The significant stability of iminium ions containing appropriate electron&#8208;donating atoms or groups accounts for the basicity of the corresponding enamines. These findings pave the way for the future development of dual aminocatalytic processes.

&lt;p&gt;The relative thermodynamic stability of two series of enamines has been examined using DFT (mainly M06-2X), MP2, and CCSD(T) calculations, supplemented by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectroscopy in some cases. The basicity of enamines derived from pyrrolidine and various carbonyl compounds has been computationally compared in the gas phase and in water; the results indicate which enamines or iminium ions may predominate in nonpolar and polar acidic media when pyrrolidine and two or more carbonyl groups or carbonyl compounds are present in the reaction flask. The relative basicity of a second series of enamines, from propanal and chiral pyrrolidines or imidazolidin-4-ones, has also been investigated; this sheds light on the main intermediates that should be expected when two or more secondary amines are present in acid-catalyzed aldehyde reactions.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The methylthio group plays a significant role in antitumor bioactive molecules, candidate drugs and natural products. Deuteration modification of drugs, which could prolong the half&#8208;life, reduce toxicity, and enhance targeting, has become an important strategy in the development and discovery of innovative drugs. Combining the unique properties of the methylthio group with the deuteration effect, the rapid introduction of trideuteromethylthiol groups into small organic molecules is essential for advancing the research and development of deuterated drugs. With the rapid development of new trideuteromethylthiolation reagents, this review first outlines the indirect introduction of trideuteromethylthiol groups, and then discusses the direct nucleophilic, electrophilic and free radical trideuteromethylthiolation methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Direct N&#8211;C(sp2) Nitrone Synthesis from Oxime</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrones are pivotal in organic chemistry, especially for the synthesis of natural and biologically active compounds via 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions and Kinugasa reactions. Although numerous methods have been reported for the synthesis of nitrones with an sp3 carbon connected to a nitrogen atom, the development of nitrones with an sp2 carbon linkage, including N&#8208;vinyl, N&#8208;aryl, and N&#8208;alkoxycarbonyl nitrones, remains relatively underexplored. This review summarizes the current research trends and methodologies for the direct synthesis of nitrones, in which an sp2 carbon is directly bonded to a nitrogen atom, beginning with oximes.</dc:description>
