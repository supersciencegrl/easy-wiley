         <title>Decatungstate Photocatalyzed Radical Addition of 9&#8208;substituted Fluorenes to [60]Fullerene: A Mechanistic Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An innovative, efficient regioselective functionalization of C  60  with  9H  &#8208;fluorenes has been disclosed. This efficient photochemical approach uses certain fluorenyl radicals in  9  &#8208;  position deriving from fluorenes through a hydrogen&#8208;atom abstraction process mediated by tetrabutylammonium decatungstate [(  n  &#8208;Bu  4  N)  4  W  10  O  32  ]. The single addition of these fluorenyl radicals to C  60  proceeded to produce [60]fullerene&#8211;fluorene dyads in a single step. The scope and mechanism of this new reaction have been examined. The primary kinetic isotope effect measurements signify the presence of a stepwise mechanism in which the C&#8208;H (D) bond scission is the rate&#8208;limiting step of the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Bidirectional Synthesis, Photophysical and Electrochemical Characterization of Polycyclic Quinones Using Benzocyclobutenes and Benzodicyclobutenes as Precursors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quinones have widespread applications in view of their interesting chemical and photophysical features. On the other hand, benzocyclobutenes (BCBs) are generally masked reactive dienes suitable for the [4+2] cycloaddition reactions. Here, benzocyclobutene (BCB) and benzodicyclobutenes (BDCBs) were prepared and further reacted with benzoquinone and naphthoquinone in order to obtain some new polycyclic quinones with highly extended&#160;&#960;&#160;systems, namely, 6&#8208;bromo&#8208;5,8&#8208;dimethoxyanthracene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione, 2,9(10)&#8208;dibromo&#8208;1,4,8,11&#8208;tetramethoxypentacene&#8208;6,13&#8208;dione, 9&#8208;bromo&#8208;7,10&#8208;dimethoxytetracene&#8208;5,12&#8208;dione, 3,10&#8208;dimethoxycyclobuta[b]anthracene&#8208;1,5,8(2H)&#8208;trione,&#160;&#8206;6,10,17,21&#8208;tetramethoxynonacene&#8208;1,4,8,12,15,19&#8208;hexaone, and 3,12&#8208;dimethoxycyclobuta[b]tetracene&#8208;1,5,10(2H)&#8208;trione.

         <dc:description>The regioselective  anti  &#8208;dichlorination and allylic chlorination of isolated double bonds is described using a combination of methyl phenyl sulfoxide and TMSCl. The method has been appropriately adjusted to fit the continuous flow technology requirements, aiming to a broader industrial implementation in the synthesis of pharmaceutically important compounds. Towards the same direction, a catalytic protocol has been developed, using sub&#8208;stoichiometric amount of sulfoxide and environmentally friendly H  2  O  2  as the stoichiometric oxidant, with comparable efficacy.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The N&#8208;confused pyritriphyrin(3.3.1) was synthesized by switching the bonding mode of subpyriporphyrin with inclusion of two o &#8208;phenylene rings in the macrocyclic core and prevails nonaromatic character due to the local aromatic characteristic of the embedded 3,5&#8208;diphenylpyridyl unit. The simplest contracted derivative of N&#8208;confused pyricalixphyrin such as calix[2]phyrin(2.2. 1.1.1 ) is mainly achieved; (a) along with N&#8208;confused pyritriphyrin; (b) by changing the reaction condition and (c) from N&#8208;confused pyritriphyrin by using simple reducing agent. The conversion of N&#8208;confused pyritriphyrin to respective calixphyrin analogue was elusive so far. The molecular structure of calixphyrin is unambiguously confirmed by crystal analysis which reveals its partial ruffled conformation with exclusively amine pyrrole units in the macrocyclic core in spite of steric congestion, which is unprecedented to date.</dc:description>

         <title>A Proline and 4&#8208;Hydroxyproline Based Approach to Enantiopure Pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;Substituted Pyridine and Pyrimidine Derivatives</title>

The three components, ammonia, acetylacetone, and proline derivatives are starting materials for &#946;&#8208;ketoenamides. Smooth subsequent transformations generate a library of enantiopure pyridine and pyrimidine derivatives.







Abstract
The optimized coupling of N&#8208;protected (S)&#8208;proline and (2S,4R)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyproline derivatives with (Z)&#8208;4&#8208;aminopent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;one provided the expected &#946;&#8208;ketoenamides in good to excellent yields. The subsequent intramolecular cyclizations afforded enantiopure pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives with pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;yl substituents. The nonaflates generated from these intermediates were excellent precursors for typical palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions. Oxidation with m&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid gave pyrrolidine N&#8208;oxides whose subsequent reactions were investigated. The condensation of &#946;&#8208;ketoenamides with hydroxylamine hydrochloride furnished the corresponding enantiopure pyrimidine N&#8208;oxides in good yields. The subsequent Boekelheide rearrangement provided hydroxymethyl&#8208;substituted pyrimidine derivatives together with minor components. Overall, this study nicely demonstrates the potential of (S)&#8208;proline&#8208; or (2S,4R)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyproline&#8208;derived &#946;&#8208;ketoenamides to approach a library of novel chiral pool&#8208;derived enantiopure functionalized pyridine and pyrimidine derivatives.

         <title>Stabilizing Indigo&#160;Z&#8208;isomer via Intramolecular Associations of Redox&#8208;Active Appendages</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoswitchable small molecules, such as  N  ,  N'&#8208;  disubstituted indigos, have received great interest within fields such as pharmacology, energy storage, and functional materials, as they represent key building blocks for reversible and non&#8208;invasive control of chemical processes. However, to ensure applicability of photochromic systems it is of paramount importance to manipulate the photostationary state. In this work, we achieved this by tethering two redox&#8208;active indenofluorene&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene units to an  N  ,  N'  &#8208;disubstituted indigo photoswitch. Upon two&#8208;electron oxidation, we observe significantly enhanced stability of the  Z  &#8208;isomer, compared to the neutral compound, illustrated by a substantial increase in the half&#8208;life from 0.48 seconds to 22 hours. This remarkable stabilization is ascribed to formation of strong, intramolecular pi&#8208;dimers between the oxidized subunits.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Open&#8208;Cage Fullerenes with Pyrrole, Pyrrolone, Pyridinone, Iminofuran, and Pyranone Fragments Embedded on the Rim of the Orifice</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The open&#8208;cage fullerene with a keto&#8208;lactone moiety reacted with aniline to form open&#8208;cage fullerenes with various functional groups on the rim of the expanded orifice. Decarbonylation and decarboxylation process took place under milder conditions compared to those for classical organic compounds. One water molecule could be trapped in the cavity of the new open&#8208;cage compounds as revealed by NMR and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data.







Abstract
An open&#8208;cage fullerene derivative with a pyranone and a diiminopentanone moiety was prepared. Further reaction with aniline could convert the pyranone moiety into a pyrrole moiety through the pyridinone moiety as an intermediate. During the process, decarboxylation and dehydroxylation aromatization reactions also took place on the diiminopentanone moiety and the two adjacent hydroxyl groups, thus forming iminofuran or pyrrolone moiety on the rim of the open&#8208;cage fullerene. Protonation experiment showed that the imino nitrogen atom on the rim of the orifice is more basic than the pyrrole nitrogen atom. The lone pair of the pyrrole nitrogen is partially conjugated with the &#960; system of the fullerene cage as shown by single crystal X&#8208;ray structures.

         <title>&#8220;Haliranium Ion&#8221;&#8208;Induced Intermolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts Alkylation in HFIP: Synthesis of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;Diaryl &#945;&#8208;Halo carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 33, Page 4737-4749, September 7, 2021. </description>

&#946;,&#946;&#8208;Diaryl &#945;&#8208;halo carbonyl compounds are versatile building blocks and common targets in organic synthesis. Herein we present metal&#8208;, oxidant&#8208; and additive free a mild method to access such halo&#8208;functionalized building blocks in excellent selectivities via haliranium ion&#8208;triggered Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type alkylation with a broad range of chalcones and cinnamate esters in HFIP.







Abstract
Here reports a highly regio&#8208; and diastereoselective haliranium ion&#8208;induced intermolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds in HFIP. The operationally simple and mild method affords the synthetically useful &#946;,&#946;&#8208;diarylated &#945;&#8208;halo carbonyl compounds in good yields after a very short reaction time. As an application, a few examples of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;diarylated olefins are prepared in excellent yields. Based on the experimental results and a qualitative study of 1D&#8208;NMR&#8208;experiments, a plausible reaction mechanism is proposed.

         <title>Electrochemical Direct Thiolation of Lactams with Mercaptans: An Efficient Access to N&#8208;Acylsulfenamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 33, Page 4728-4732, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A variety of N&#8208;acylsulfenamides are produced by the electrochemically enabled cross&#8208;coupling of readily available feedstocks under standard conditions. This protocol is practical and has wide substrate scope with good reaction efficiency (38 examples, up to 97&#8201;% yield). A possible free radical mechanism is preliminarily demonstrated.







Abstract
An efficient and eco&#8208;friendly electrochemical methodology for the oxidative cross coupling hydrogen evolution (CCHE) reactions of lactams with thiols is presented. Various electron deficient N&#8208;acylsulfenamides are smoothly produced in modest to excellent yields without using any external oxidant. Elementary mechanistic insight supports a possible free radical process and hydrogen is the only side product. This approach provides a safe, convenient, and economical preparation of synthetically important N&#8208;thiophthalimides on a gram scale.

         <title>Cucurbiturils Monofunctionalized on the Methylene Bridge and Their Host&#8208;Guest Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 33, Page 4733-4736, September 7, 2021. </description>

Monofunctionalized cucurbiturils bearing a nitro or an ammonium group were prepared. The macrocycles formed dimeric self&#8208;assembly, inclusion complexes with cucurbit[7]urils, and diastereomeric complexes with pyridinium guests.







Abstract
Monofunctionalization of cucurbiturils is essential for transferring these potent supramolecular macrocyclic hosts into real&#8208;world application. Here, we present the synthesis of cucurbit[6]urils 1 and 2 in which one methylene bridge is modified by a single substituent containing a nitro or an ammonium group. We investigated host&#8211;guest properties in water and 0.2&#8197;M NaCl using 1H&#160;NMR and isothermal titration calorimetry, particularly for 2. The macrocycle 2 self&#8208;associated into dimeric aggregates in pure water, but readily disassembled in the presence of NaCl or organic cations. Cucurbit[7]uril was able to encapsulate the ammonium substituent of 2 inside its cavity resulting in a complex of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry with an association constant of 3.1&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1. The presented host&#8211;guest properties together with further possible derivatization showcase the potential of cucurbiturils modified in the methylene position such as 1 and 2 for the development of advanced supramolecular systems.

We investigated host&#8211;guest properties in water and 0.2&#8197;M NaCl using &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#160;NMR and isothermal titration calorimetry, particularly for &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;. The macrocycle &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; self-associated into dimeric aggregates in pure water, but readily disassembled in the presence of NaCl or organic cations. Cucurbit[7]uril was able to encapsulate the ammonium substituent of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; inside its cavity resulting in a complex of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry with an association constant of 3.1&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The presented host&#8211;guest properties together with further possible derivatization showcase the potential of cucurbiturils modified in the methylene position such as &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; for the development of advanced supramolecular systems.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>HFIP&#8208;Promoted Substitution in the Ferrocene Series: Smooth Approach towards Original Catalysts**
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudo&#8208;benzylic substitution promoted by fluorinated solvent from various iodoferrocenes is described. These new reaction conditions allow the fast generation of libraries of derivatives for applications in catalysis for example, as demonstrated with the synthesis of original ligands used in cross&#8208;coupling reactions.







Abstract
Pseudo&#8208;benzylic substitution is an important reaction in the ferrocene series, especially to obtain ligands for catalysis. Herein, we described new reactions conditions, using fluorinated alcohols as both solvent and promoter, able to deliver iodoferrocene derivatives faster than using classical solvents. Various N, O, P and C&#8208;nucleophiles were found compatible with this transformation which occurs with full retention of stereochemistry. Original P,N&#8208;ligands were prepared by using iodine/lithium exchange&#8208;chlorophoshine trapping sequences, and their properties were evaluated in Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura and Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig coupling as well as in ketone &#945;&#8208;arylation reaction.

The work describes an intermolecular transthiolation of Ar&#8722;OTf using methyl 3&#8208;(alkyllthio) propanoate as an odourless thiol surrogate. A series of substituted aryl methyl sulfides have been obtained in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
A method for the odorless synthesis of unsymmetrical sulfides via Csp2&#8722;O and Csp3&#8722;S bond activation is presented. Using methyl 3&#8208;(methylthio) propanoate as a MeSH surrogate, a series of substituted aryl methyl sulfides have been obtained in moderate to good yields. This catalytic protocol can also tolerate methyl 3&#8208;(methylthio)propionate derivatives to afford the corresponding aryl sulfides.

         <title>Organocatalytic Desymmetrization of Meso&#8208;Aziridines Via Asymmetric Intramolecular Rearrangement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 33, Page 4560-4565, September 7, 2021. </description>

Enantioenriched N&#8208;tosyl&#8208;4&#8208;aminocyclopentenone, a key synthon for the preparation of natural products and many nucleoside inhibitors, was obtained via a new ring&#8208;opening of a strained aziridine in high yields and in moderate (up to 74&#8201;% ee, 87&#8201;:&#8201;13&#8197;er) enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Herein we report the first organocatalytic method for the desymmetrization of meso&#8208;aziridines that does not require the use of an external nucleophilic reagent. The process was designed upon a base promoted rearrangement of bicyclic meso&#8208;cyclopentanone aziridines, that progresses in intramolecular fashion to provide densely functionalized cyclic ketones, key intermediates for the preparation of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients. The key enantio&#8208;determining step proceeded under the catalysis of a bifunctional thiourea organocatalyst. The process provides an entry to a class of highly functionalized chiral amines, 4&#8208;aminocyclopentenones, not accessible with previous desymmetrization methods. The ambiphilic nature of the products makes them versatile synthetic intermediates in the preparation of natural products and popular antiviral nucleoside inhibitors, for example abacavir.

         <title>Reactions of Allenes with strong Borane&#8208;Based Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 33, Page 4707-4714, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of allenes with strong boron&#8208;based Lewis acids leads to a plethora of chemical transformations that proceed via interesting mechanisms, often including skeletal rearrangements of the former allene as an elementary step. Furthermore, many of these transformations form new C&#8722;C bonds are thus relevant to synthetic organic chemistry.







Abstract
In recent years, reactions of unsaturated organic molecules with strong boron&#8208;based Lewis acids have attracted considerable attention. In this review, reactions of allenes with boron&#8208;based Lewis acids, especially such ones equipped with perfluorophenyl rings, are discussed. It is shown that depending on the substitution pattern of the allene and the borane, a surprisingly broad variety of chemical transformations can be observed. These transformations often include unexpected skeletal rearrangements of the former allene. Furthermore, some transformations require only catalytic amounts of the borane&#8208;based Lewis acid. Within this minireview, emphasis is given to the mechanistic aspects of these transformations, and similarities in the initial reaction steps are outlined.

Celebrating the tenth year of the prestigious Nobel prize in 2010 for palladium chemistry; still, palladium stands strong over other transition metals for its versatility. Cascade reactions in contemporary organic synthesis reduced cost and time through careful design. This review outlines Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions in organic synthesis from the post&#8208;Nobel era.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization received much attention in organic synthesis due to its efficiency and rapid transformation of simple starting materials into complex molecular skeletons. Celebrating the 10th year of the prestigious Nobel prize for palladium chemistry, we witness it still proceeds strong over other transition metals for its versatility. Cascade reactions in contemporary organic synthesis reduced cost and time through careful design. It has emerged as the first choice, a powerful tool for multiple bond formations in one step with a wide range of functional group tolerance due to the deep understanding of various pathways. A variety of compounds with biological relevance with complex molecular scaffolds have been achieved using these cascade coupling reactions. This review outlines Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions from the post&#8208;Nobel era. Nevertheless, more discoveries and endless possibilities for new transformations are underway.

         <title>Stereoselective Cross&#8208;Coupling of Grignard Reagents and Conjugated Dienylbromides using Iron Salts with Magnesium Alkoxides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 33, Page 4701-4706, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of dienic scaffolds by Fe&#8208;mediated coupling between Grignard reagents and dienyl bromides is reported. This methodology involves the use of magnesium alkoxides as additives, and can be applied to targets of industrial interest, such as insect pheromones. Mechanistic studies suggest that the active species is an organoiron(II) complex, showing that no reduction of the precursor to low oxidation states is required.







Abstract
A convenient procedure allowing iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl or aryl Grignard reagents and conjugated dienyl bromides is reported, relying on the use of cheap and non&#8208;toxic magnesium alkoxides as sole additives. An excellent stereoselectivity is observed in the alkyl&#8208;dienyl series. This sequence has been applied to the synthesis of the sex pheromone of codling moth, illustrating its applicability for obtaining targets of industrial interest. Preliminary mechanistic studies carried out on the aryl&#8208;dienyl cross&#8208;coupling suggest that in&#8197;situ generated ate homoleptic organoiron(II) species act as catalytically relevant intermediates. A modified preparative method for the realization of THF solutions of dienyl bromides as &#8220;ready&#8208;to&#8208;use&#8221; coupling partners is also discussed, circumventing the thermal instability of those derivatives.

         <title>Carboxylic Acid Promoted, Redox&#8208;Neutral Ru&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Allylation of Aromatic Ketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 33, Page 4611-4615, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative method for the weakly coordinating, ketone&#8208;directed C(sp2)&#8722;H allylation of aromatic ketones such as substituted acetophenones, 3&#8208;acetyl indoles, and chalcones was developed under redox&#8208;neutral conditions. 1&#8208;Adamantane carboxylic acid plays a crucial role in improving the reactivity of the [RuCl2(p&#8208;cymene)]2 catalyst at mild reaction temperatures. This method provides an access to various synthetically useful terminal olefin systems in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
A redox&#8208;neutral, carboxylic acid promoted, [RuCl2(p&#8208;cymene)]2 catalyzed, weakly coordinating, carbonyl assisted C&#8722;H allylation of aromatic ketones has been developed. The beneficial effect of carboxylic acid on the ruthenium catalyst towards C&#8722;H allylation of aromatic ketones has been further explored, using commercially available allyl acetate under mild reaction conditions. In addition, this method requires redox&#8208;neutral reaction conditions, easily accessible starting materials, and shows excellent functional group compatibility.

         <title>Isolation of a Cyclopentasilane from Magnesium Reduction of a Linear Hexasilane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 33, Page 4641-4646, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Mg0 promoted reduction of a sterically hindered 1,6&#8208;dibromohexasilane yielded a cyclopentasilane as the main product. The disilane t&#8208;BuPhHSi&#8208;SiHPht&#8208;Bu was identified as a minor product, which suggests a possible mechanism involving elimination of a transient silylene SiPht&#8208;Bu.







Abstract
The reductive cyclization of two linear hexasilanes is contrasted, where a methylated precursor yielded a cyclohexasilane while the tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;functionalized analog unexpectedly yielded a cyclopentasilane. A comprehensive analysis using X&#8208;ray diffraction, IR, HR, HRMS, and multinuclear (1H, 13C and 29Si) 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy identified the 1,2&#8208;dihydrodisilane tBuPhHSi&#8208;SiHPhtBu as an additional product, which was interpreted as supportive of a mechanism involving silylene elimination. The results of this study may prove informative about substituent effects in the practice of complex organosilicon molecular synthesis.

         <title>C&#8208;5 Aryl Substituted Azaspirooxindolinones Derivatives: Synthesis and Biological Evaluation as Potential Inhibitors of Tec Family Kinases</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 33, Page 4630-4640, September 7, 2021. </description>

A new series of nineteen compounds was synthesized by developing on two positions of 5&#8242;&#8208;arylspiro[piperidine&#8208;4,3&#8242;&#8208;pyridin]&#8208;2&#8242;(1&#8242;H)&#8208;one moiety. The structure&#8208;activity relationships of these compounds were investigate against a panel of ITK and BTK cancer cell lines. Four of the N&#8208;acylated derivatives with C5&#8208;benzodioxyl group exhibited an excellent antiproliferative activity against Jurkat, CCRF&#8208;CEM, CEM&#8208;DNR and RAMOS cell lines.







Abstract
The interleukin&#8208;2&#8208;inducible kinase (ITK) and Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) are two crucial Tec family kinase members with important roles in the development of hematopoietic malignancies, autoimmune disorders and other diseases in humans. Thus, ITK and BTK are key targets for drug development. Spirooxindoles are important scaffolds for the synthesis of small molecules with broad and potent biological activities. In this study, we performed a structure&#8208;activity relationship study of a new series of 5&#8242;&#8208;(benzo[d][1,3]dioxol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)spiro[piperidine&#8208;4,3&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolo[2,3&#8211;b]pyridin]&#8208;2&#8242;(1&#8242;H)&#8208;one linked with N&#8208;acyl and C&#8208;5 aryl&#8208;substituted scaffolds in a panel of ITK and BTK cancer cell lines. Four compounds 11, 12, 14, and 15 showed high antiproliferative activity against ITK and BTK cell lines. Compounds 11 and 12 with a C&#8208;5 benzodioxole group and gem&#8208;dialkyl group attached to carbonyl on piperidine were highly effective in ITK&#8208;high Jurkat and CEM cell lines, and compound 14, a biotin analogue, was identified as a good inhibitor of BTK&#8208;high RAMOS cells. Compound 15 with cyclopropyl group attached to carbonyl on piperidine also showed good activity in ITK and BTK cell lines.

         <title>Organocatalysis Meets Hydrocarbon Oxyfunctionalization: the Role of N&#8208;Hydroxyimides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 33, Page 4715-4727, September 7, 2021. </description>

Organocatalysis and C&#8722;H bond oxyfunctionalization are two rising research areas. The use of N&#8208;hydroxyphtalimide&#8208;based systems towards the selective oxyfunctionalization of hydrocarbons is a powerful synthetic approach, affording new efficient and selective protocols. This short review provides an overview of relevant contributions on this field, both in homogeneous and heterogeneous phase.







Abstract
The merging of organocatalysis and C&#8722;H bond oxyfunctionalization has demonstrated to be a powerful approach towards the development of new efficient and selective synthetic protocols. Both research areas have witnessed a tremendous growth over the past two decades, with a high number of studies mainly reporting the use of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) and related compounds in the selective oxyfunctionalization of hydrocarbons. Additionally, heterogeneous NHPI&#8208;based systems can provide a green and sustainable perspective for oxidation reactions. Nevertheless, reports related to this latter approach are still scarce and need further scouting in terms of types of supports used. This short review accounts for relevant contributions from 2010 onwards on the use of NHPI&#8208;based systems for hydrocarbon oxyfunctionalization.

         <title>[11C]HCN Radiochemistry: Recent Progress and Future Perspectives</title>

11C&#8208;Cyanation is an important radiochemistry method for labeling organic molecules with carbon&#8208;11 positron emitter (11C, t1/2=20.4&#8197;min). This minireview covers the 11C&#8208;cyanation method development in the past two decades as well as their application in the synthesis of new 11C&#8208;labeled radiotracers.







Abstract
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a unique non&#8208;invasive imaging tool for studying in&#8197;vivo biological processes. It utilizes short&#8208;lived positron emitter labeled organic molecules to study biological events in real&#8208;time. To incorporate the positron emitter into a molecule of biological interest, radioactive synthons are developed to facilitate radiolabeling chemistry. In addition to 11C&#8208;methylation with [11C]CH3I/[11C]CH3OTf, 11C&#8208;carbonylation with [11C]CO, and 11C&#8208;carboxylation of organometallic reagents with [11C]CO2, 11C&#8208;cyanation with [11C]HCN is another frequently used 11C&#8208;labeling methodology. It can lead to the generation of [11C]organo&#8208;nitriles, [carbonyl&#8208;11C]carboxylic acids, [carbonyl&#8208;11C]aldehydes, [carbonyl&#8208;11C]amides, [11C]alkyl amines, [tetrazoyl&#8208;11C]tetrazoles, [11C]CN&#8208;containing heterocycles, etc. This review recognizes the important roles of 11C&#8208;cyanation reactions with the emphasis of recent advances, along with the discussion of molar activities (Am) of [11C]HCN based radiotracers and prompts for future potential [11C]cyanide based radiotracer development.

The Front Cover shows, in analogy with butterflies that undergo change of shape through their life cycle, the transformative rearrangement of bicyclic meso&#8208;aziridines to form cyclopentenones. In this unprecedented reaction, chirality was liberated from an achiral precursor and was set free to fly to make drug precursors. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C. Monasterolo, M. F. A. Adamo et&#8197;al.

Two types of benzotrithiophene derivatives bearing acceptor units have been synthesized, and some physical properties have been estimated. Organic thin&#8208;film solar cells using two types of benzotrithiophene derivatives as non&#8208;fullerene acceptors showed the power conversion efficiency. In addition, these materials were found to be effective for the ternary blend organic solar cells as the additive.

The HOMO&#8208;LUMO levels of 1 and 2 were determined by photoemission spectroscopy and UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy. Binary blend and ternary blend bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells with non&#8208;fullerene acceptors 1 and 2 were fabricated with the inverted device structures of glass/ITO/ZnO/active_layer/MoO3/Ag. Both binary blend BHJ solar cells with 1 and 2 show lower JSC and larger VOC values than P3HT&#8201;:&#8201;PCBM solar cells. On the other hand, ternary blend BHJ organic solar cells, including 10&#8201;% of 1, exhibited a larger power conversion efficiency than P3HT&#8201;:&#8201;PCBM solar cells because the JSC value was largely improved.

         <title>Recent Advances in Organic Synthesis Using Light&#8208;Mediated N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
The development of dual catalytic systems mediated by light is on the rise. In particular, light&#8208;mediated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis has recently experienced an exponential growth. This minireview gives an overview on the activation modes and synthetic opportunities that the combination of photoredox/NHC catalysis has to offer and discuss other approaches that do not require the use of an external photocatalyst.







Abstract
The combination of photocatalysis with other ground state catalytic systems have attracted much attention recently due to the enormous synthetic potential offered by a dual activation mode. The use of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) as organocatalysts emerged as an important synthetic tool. Its ability to harness umpolung reactivity by the formation of the Breslow intermediate has been employed in the synthesis of thousands of biologically important compounds. However, the available coupling partners are relatively restricted, and its combination with other catalytic systems might improve its synthetic versatility. Thus, merging photoredox and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis has emerged recently as a powerful strategy to develop new transformations and give access to a whole new branch of synthetic possibilities. This review compiles the NHC catalyzed methods mediated by light, either in the presence or absence of an external photocatalyst, that have been described so far, and aims to give an accurate overview of the potential of this activation mode.

         <title>Triplet&#8208;Forming Thionated Donor&#8208;Acceptor Chromophores for Electrochemically Amphoteric Photosensitization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 33, Page 4647-4652, September 7, 2021. </description>

Thiocarbonylation has been shown to be a promising tool for developing heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free triplet photosensitizers from donor&#8722;acceptor chromophores. It was demonstrated that triplet&#8208;state formation from the thiocarbonyls is independent of the donor&#8722;acceptor interactions and that the thionated chromophores can be utilized as amphoteric photoredox catalysts that have comparable catalytic activities to common inorganic photosensitizers.







Abstract
A series of piperidine&#8208;naphthalene monoimide, donor&#8722;acceptor (D&#8722;A) chromophores and their thionated derivatives were prepared. The physical properties of the chromophores were studied by spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements and DFT calculations. Relative to their non&#8208;thionated counterparts, the thionated D&#8722;A chromophores display enhanced visible&#8208;light absorption and 1O2&#8208;sensitization quantum yields and negligible fluorescence, suggesting facile triplet formation of this class of molecules. This behavior originates from the significant n&#8208;&#960;* character in the singlet excited state, resulting in large spin&#8208;orbit coupling between the singlet/triplet manifolds regardless of the degree of D/A interactions. With the electrochemically active D/A moieties and high triplet energy, the thionated chromophores can be used as amphoteric photosensitizers to catalyze reductive and oxidative photoreactions with efficiency comparable to Ru(bpy)32+ as the sensitizer. Our results demonstrate that thiocarbonylation can be utilized in amide/imide&#8208;containing D&#8722;A chromophores to provide a wide range of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free redox&#8208;active photosensitizers.

A highly efficient protocol for the synthesis of thio&#8208;/selenopyrrolines has been developed via a SnCl4&#8208;catalyzed (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of aryl thio&#8208;/selenocyanates with donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs). The protocol rendered a variety of thio&#8208;/selenopyrrolines in good to excellent yields.







Abstract
A straightforward protocol has been developed to access thio&#8208;/selenopyrrolines through a (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of aryl thio&#8208;/selenocyanates with donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) in the presence of SnCl4 as a Lewis acid catalyst. Further, good chemoselectivity was observed when DACs were treated with 3&#8208;cyano phenyl thiocyanate. These results suggest that thiocyanate is more reactive than nitrile moiety in such (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition reactions.

         <title>Electrochemical and Spectroscopic Studies on Triarylamine&#8208;Polychlorotriphenylmethyl Dyads with Particularly Strong Triarylamine Donors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 33, Page 4690-4700, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new donor&#8208;acceptor dyads with a particular electron&#8208;rich triarylamine (TAA) donor and the perchlorotriphenylmethyl radical acceptor (PCT) are probed for their propensity to equilibrate with their zwitterionic valence tautomers TAA+&#8208;PCT&#8722;. The UV/vis/NIR and EPR spectroscopic profiles of their oxidized and reduced forms were recorded, but failed to identify such isomers in the neutral state. The cations have an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state, situated slightly below the triplet state.







Abstract
We present two new donor&#8208;acceptor dyads composed of a polychlorotriphenylmethyl radical (PTM.) as the acceptor (A) and bis(4&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl)(phenyl)amine (TPAN) or 2,2&#8217;:6&#8217;,2&#8217;&#8217;:6&#8217;&#8217;,6&#8208;trioxytriphenylamine (TOTA) as particularly electron&#8208;rich triarylamine (TAA) donors (D). We assessed their electrochemical properties and electronic structures by cyclic voltammetry, UV/vis/NIR spectroscopy, EPR spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. By establishing the spectroscopic fingerprints of the oxidized and reduced forms, we probe for the possible coexistence of a zwitterionic TAA+&#8208;PTM&#8722; valence tautomer (VT), besides neutral TAA&#8208;PTM.. UV/vis/NIR and EPR spectroscopic studies at variable temperature and in various solvents however provide no indication for such equilibria. Quantitative spin counting experiments by EPR spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations indicate that the one&#8208;electron oxidized forms of these dyads possess an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state which is energetically slightly below the triplet state

         <title>A 2000 to 2020 Practitioner&#8217;s Guide to Chiral Amine Based Enantioselective Aldol Reactions:Common Ketone Substrates,Best Methods,in Water Reaction Environments,and Defining Nuances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We begin with an extensive introduction for the non&#8208;expert regarding enantioselective, amine catalyzed, aldol reactions (Sections 1&#8208;3). There, a broad prospective is provided regarding: methodology limitations, mechanism, in water versus on water definitions and their theoretical basis, small&#8208; and large&#8208;scale physical&#8208;mechanical aspects, solid versus liquid starting material considerations, reproducibility, ball milling, diketone substrates, etc. The thematic emphasis then turns to practical outcomes for the reaction of nineteen aliphatic, cyclic, and aromatic ketones with 4&#8208;nitrobenzaldehyde and benzaldehyde prior to 2021. The ketone substrates are listed in Section 4 of the TOC and their structures are shown in Figure 1. Each ketone is linked to a summary defined by a: (i) schematic, (ii) text summary, (iii) catalyst Figures, and (iv) tabular reaction/product data. Individual ketone summaries, at times, represent the distillation of over six hundred research articles, and the data refinement and its tabular reconstitution is not reproducible using a chemical database search with filters. In the review&#8217;s broadest use, the Figure 1 ketone structures serve as templates to extrapolate to a hypothetical substrate holding more functionality, but of related steric and electronic similarity. This pseudo matching permits a rapid answer to, &#8220;Does this methodology suit the ketone substrate at hand or not?&#8221; In a positive outcome, the best reaction conditions (stoichiometry, catalyst structure and loading, solvent, time, etc.) to affect aldol product formation (yield, dr, and ee) are delineated. A second envisioned use allows the directed construction of diketone substrates (after viewing the tabularized data of Section 4), which then undergo regioselective mono&#8208;aldol product formation. This tactic, reacting one carbonyl moiety while the other remains unreacted, avoids ketone protection&#8208;deprotection, and is shown for the advantageous synthesis of an Alzheimer drug candidate.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;Free Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Azide&#8208;Alkyne Click Cycloadditions (CuAAc) in Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents as Green and Catalytic Reaction Media</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows the use of natural deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as catalytic green solvents for the &#8220;click&#8221; Copper&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition of azides to alkynes (CuAAc) affording 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles in excellent yields. These solvents have green properties for their low or absent volatility and toxicity and are formed from natural compounds, therefore they are biocompatible. The DESs revealed their catalytic features due to their reducing properties and their basic behavior thanks to the H&#8208;bond network, which makes the use of any base as well as sacrificial reductants superfluous. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. V. Giofr&#232;, M. Tiecco et&#8197;al.

The Front Cover shows the Palais Saint Georges (in Rennes, France, where the presented work was performed). Like every summer night, projectors shine nice pictures on this 400&#8208;year&#8208;old palace. We have decided to shine our helically chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;gold(I) complexes on it. These chiral complexes possess attractive features coming from the presence of the [5]helicenic moiety, such as strong circular dichroism activity, dual emission and moderate circularly polarized phosphorescence with a timescale up to the millisecond range at room temperature. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J. Crassous et&#8197;al.

         <title>Synthesis of Pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline Class of Natural Product Crispine A</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presented minireview provides an exclusive literature overview on the methodologies adopted for the synthesis of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline natural product crispine A over the last nine decades. The synthesis of crispine A was cumulated via Bischler&#8208;Napieralski cyclization, Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization, N&#8208;alkylation/acylation cyclization, oxidative cyclization, asymmetric hydrogenation reaction, and other miscellaneous reactions.







Abstract
As a naturally occurring small&#8208;molecule, various optical isomers of chiral pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline alkaloid crispine A represent a potential class of chiral molecules in contemporary organic chemistry, and possess diverse biological activities. The range of pharmacological activities include antidepressant, antiplatelet, antileukemic, and anticancer activities. This review provides an overview of the literature on the strategies, employed in the synthesis of crispine A in their racemic and enantiopure forms via Bischler&#8208;Napieralski cyclization, Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization, N&#8208;Alkylation/Acylation&#8208;cyclization, Oxidative cyclization, and Asymmetric hydrogenation in the period of 1931&#8211;2021. This study accentuates the need for the developing more effective synthesis, and search for involved biological applications for the pyrroloisoquinoline class of natural product. Attention has been drawn towards the use of relatively less documented but easily accessible naturally occurring diastereomeric scaffolds namely, garcinia and hibiscus acids. These lactones obtained from (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxycitric acids bearing chemically amenable functional groups are investigated as an ideal choice for the enantiopure synthesis of the (&#8722;)&#8208;(R)&#8208; and (+)&#8208;(S)&#8208;Crispine A structural frame work.

This study accentuates the need for the developing more effective synthesis, and search for involved biological applications for the pyrroloisoquinoline class of natural product. Attention has been drawn towards the use of relatively less documented but easily accessible naturally occurring diastereomeric scaffolds namely, garcinia and hibiscus acids. These lactones obtained from (+)- and (&#8722;)-2-hydroxycitric acids bearing chemically amenable functional groups are investigated as an ideal choice for the enantiopure synthesis of the (&#8722;)-(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)- and (+)-(&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-Crispine A structural frame work.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis of Diverse Seleno&#8208;Glycolipids via the Transacetalization of Selenoacetals</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seleno&#8208;glycolipids are attractive detergents for X&#8208;ray structural studies of membrane proteins. To expand the scope of available seleno&#8208;glycolipids, we established a facile synthesis toward novel mono&#8208; and diseleno&#8208;glycolipids with various glycan and lipid moieties; this proceeds via transacetalization of selenoacetals and glycosyl imidates. This work demonstrates the first synthesis of diseleno&#8208;glycolipids.







Abstract
Seleno&#8208;glycolipids, in which glycosidic oxygens are replaced with selenium atoms, are attractive detergents for X&#8208;ray structural studies of membrane proteins. However, the development of seleno&#8208;glycolipids has been hampered by difficulties associated with their chemical syntheses. In this study, we report a facile synthesis of novel seleno&#8208;glycolipids with various glycan and lipid moieties, which proceeds via transacetalization of selenoacetals and glycosyl imidates. This work not only provides a route to monoseleno&#8208;glycolipids, but also demonstrates the first synthesis of diseleno&#8208;glycolipids.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8211;H ethoxycarbonylation of indoles and arylpyridines using diethyl dicarbonate is developed. The catalytic process features an additive&#8208;free ethoxycarbonylation reaction, wherein only ethanol and CO2&#160;are produced as byproducts, providing a CO&#8208;free and operationally simple protocol. The introduced ethoxycarbonyl group is easily transformed into other ester and amide functionalities in a single step. Moreover, the reaction can be successfully applied on gram scale, and allows for the efficient synthesis of indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid esters and isophthalates.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Symmetrical and Unsymmetrical Thiosulfonates from Disulfides via Electrochemical Induced Disulfide Bond Metathesis and Site&#8208;Selective Oxidation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical, oxidative generation of symmetrical and unsymmetrical thiosulfonates is presented. First, the oxidation of disulfides yielding symmetrical thiosulfonates was realised. The direct synthesis is performed using a simple quasi&#8208;divided cell design, whereby the usage of a supporting electrolyte is unnecessary. Its principle was then expanded to the conversion of unsymmetrical disulfides that were in situ generated via metathesis of two symmetrical disulfides. This enables a direct access to unsymmetrical thiolsulfonates without any pre&#8208;functionalisation or elaborate synthesis of the starting materials for the first time. The scope of the reaction was investigated by converting different functionalised aliphatic and aromatic disulfides in moderate to very good yields. Furthermore, a sensitivity assessment for an improved reproducibility and a robustness screen to determine the compatibility of the reaction against functional groups were performed.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Promoted Glycosylation for the Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;Glycosyl Sulfonyl Amides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycosyl sulfonyl amides are synthesized in a self&#8208;promoted N&#8208;glycosylation with high &#946;&#8208;selectivity and in high yields. Armed and disarmed glycosyl donors of different size and with different protective groups react smoothly with sulfonyl amides, such as protected asparagine derivatives.

Abstract
N&#8208;Glycosyl N&#8208;sulfonyl amides have been synthesized by a self&#8208;promoted glycosylation, i.&#8201;e. without any catalysts, promotors or additives. When the reactions were carried out at lower temperatures a mixture of N&#8208; and O&#8208;glycosides were observed, where the latter rearranged to give the &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;glycosides at elevated temperatures. By this method sulfonylated asparagine derivatives can be selectively &#946;&#8208;glycosylated in high yields by trichloroacetimidate glycosyl donors of different reactivity including protected glucosamine derivatives. The chemoselectivity in the glycosylations as well as the rearrangements from O&#8208;glycosides to &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;glycosides gives information of the glycosylation mechanism. This method gives access to glycosyl sulfonyl amides under mild conditions.

         <title>Applications of Purine Ring Opening in the Synthesis of Imidazole, Pyrimidine, and New Purine Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ring system of purine is remarkably stable, but can be opened at either side, if properly activated. In this review, purine ring opening reactions leading to imidazole and pyrimidine derivatives are summarized. Purine ring opening is also a powerful tool for the synthesis of new ring&#8208;modified purine derivatives (e.&#8201;g., N1&#8208;labelled analogs) by various rearrangement pathways.







Abstract
Purines, which are regarded as relatively stable heterocyclic systems, can be opened at both pyrimidine and imidazole rings. Purine ring opening also serves as a tool for the preparation of ring&#8208;modified purines through rearrangement/recyclization mechanisms. The obtained imidazole, pyrimidine, and purine derivatives are privileged molecular scaffolds in medicinal and agricultural chemistry. Purine ring&#8208;opening approach is a useful alternative for their synthesis, which competes well with de novo approach or modification of a conserved heterocyclic core. The substitution patterns and groups that activate purines towards ring opening are reviewed. Moreover, mechanistic studies using labelled substrates, which are leading to rearranged purine derivatives are covered. Furthermore, an insight into imidazole ring opening upon exposure of purine system to DNA damaging agents is provided.

         <title>Base&#8208;Free Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Azide&#8208;Alkyne Click Cycloadditions (CuAAc) in Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents as Green and Catalytic Reaction Media**
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Click copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition reactions (CuAAc) were performed in recyclable natural deep eutectic solvents (NADESs) as green and catalytic solvents. No reducing agent was needed thanks to the NADESs&#8217; activity and the reactions did not need any base as the alkyne hydrogen was involved in the H&#8208;bonds of the NADESs.







Abstract
The click cycloaddition of azides to alkynes affording 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles is a widely used and effective chemical transformation, applied to obtain relevant products in medicine, biology, and materials science. In this work, a set of natural deep eutectic solvents (NADESs) has been investigated in the copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition reactions (CuAAc) as green and catalytic reaction media. The use of these innovative solvents has been shown to improve the reaction effectiveness, giving excellent yields. NADESs proved to be &#8220;active&#8221; in their reducing capabilities in several cases and for the absence of added bases in all the performed reactions: DFT calculations demonstrated in fact the involvement of H&#8208;bonds between DESs and alkynes, as well as stabilization of copper catalytic intermediates. The green experimental conditions, the absence of a base, the low temperatures, the lowering of reagent amounts, and the possibility of recycling of the solvents, outline the great potential of NADESs for CuAAc.

         <title>Interactions of Cellulose Model Compound D&#8208;Cellobiose with Selected Metal Chlorides in Water: Identification of Chelating Oxygen Atoms</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding interactions of metal ions with cellulose is an important step in development of efficient catalytic methods for processing cellulose. In this study, density functional theory methods were used to identify oxygen atoms interacting or chelating with selected metal chlorides of Li + , K + , Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ , Sn 2+ , Zn 2+ and La 3+ with cellulose model compound D&#8208;cellobiose. Calculated metal&#8208;oxygen distances of energy minimized D&#8208;cellobiose: metal chloride 1: 2 mixtures revealed that the metal ions approach between the two glucose rings in &#945;/&#946;&#8722;D&#8208;cellobiose, and O 4 , O 9 are the preferred interaction/chelation points. DFT study supported a previous 13 C NMR chemical shift change based experiments. ZnCl 2 showing the shortest metal&#8208;oxygen distances in approach to &#945;/&#946; D&#8208;cellobiose is known to produce the largest 13 C NMR chemical shift changes in D&#8208;cellobiose. In &#945;&#8208;anomer, average closest metal&#8208;oxygen distances and NMR shift changes co&#8208;related at 95% confidence interval with liner regression R 2 = 0.8582 and Sy.x = 0.5722.</dc:description>

         <title>Helically Chiral NHC&#8208;Gold(I) Complexes: Synthesis, Chiroptical Properties and Electronic Features of the [5]Helicene&#8208;Imidazolylidene Ligand</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The golden twist: Monodentate [5]helicene&#8208;imidazolylidene gold(I) complexes were prepared in good yields and structurally characterized. Benefiting from the presence of the configurationally stable [5]helicenic unit, they exhibit appealing chiroptical features, such as strong circular dichroism, moderate circularly polarized phosphorescence and dual emission with phosphorescence lifetimes up to the millisecond range.







Abstract
We describe the preparation of helically chiral gold(I) complexes bearing a [5]helicenic&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand. They were successfully obtained as enantiopure compounds by semi&#8208;preparative chiral HPLC and their structural, chiroptical, and photophysical properties were subsequently investigated. Notably, strong electronic circular dichroism, dual emission from singlet and triplet states, with the timescale of the latter up to the millisecond range at room temperature, and moderate circularly phosphorescence were observed. The &#963;&#8208;donating and &#960;&#8208;accepting properties of the constituent helical ortho&#8208;fused &#960;&#8208;conjugated carbene were investigated by classical quantitative analysis of the IR stretching frequencies and NMR characteristics of the corresponding Ir(CO)2Cl complex and selenourea.

         <title>Lewis&#8208;Acid&#8208;Catalyzed (3+2)&#8208;Cycloadditions of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes with Thioketenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of dialkyl 2&#8208;methylidene tetrahydrothiophene&#8208;3,3&#8208;dicarboxylates was prepared from (tert&#8208;butyl)iso&#8208;propyl thioketene via Lewis acid catalyzed (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition with D&#8208;A cyclopropanes. In all studied cases the (Z)&#8208;diastereoisomer was found as the main product.







Abstract
The reactivity of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) cyclopropanes towards thioketenes was investigated. In a (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition using Sc(OTf)3 as a Lewis acidic catalyst, the corresponding exocyclic thioenol ethers (2&#8208;methylidene tetrahydrothiophenes) were formed in moderate to good yields. Unsymmetrical thioketenes provided E/Z mixtures at the double bond, with the Z isomer being preferred.

         <title>Microwave Assisted Condensation of Benzylic Alcohols and Alkynes Promoted by Zinc Halides: Concise Access to Alkenyl Halides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple Lewis acid&#8208;mediated route for the synthesis of alkenyl halides is described under microwave&#8208;assisted conditions. The reaction proceeds through the condensation between sec&#8208;alcohols and terminal acetylenes, and regioselective hydrohalogenation across the triple bond in the presence of simple and commercially available zinc halides. Unlike earlier reports, this methodology is successfully exemplified with three halide sources. As a result, a diverse range of alkenyl halide products has been accomplished. Further, indenes were obtained as the end products when  tert  &#8208;alcohols and arylacetylenes were used, wherein, the Thorpe&#8211;Ingold, as well as electronic effects, would be dominant. Furthermore, when an electron&#8208;rich arylacetylene was employed, directed to yield carbonyl products.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanically Interlocked Molecules for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview presents recent examples of mechanically interlocked structures for biological and medical applications. Topics discussed include smart drugs, theranostics, sensing of medically relevant species, as well as protein&#8208; and DNA engineering. Utilizing the unique properties of the mechanical bond to construct functional systems for biomedical applications can serve as a paradigm for further developments in these fields.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) carry great potential in different fields of chemistry, based on their specific structures, their internal dynamics, their stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior, and other unique features of the mechanical bond. This minireview presents some of the most recent developments in their use for medical and biological applications. For example, they have been used to influence, enhance or block the action of therapeutic agents to enable targeted drug delivery. The dynamic structural properties have been used to generate switches and transporters, as well as sensors for various medically relevant species. Building MIMs by incorporating biomolecules like DNA and proteins has served as a novel way to control their properties.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Polymer Bioconjugates Prepared by Post&#8208;Polymerization Modification of Alternating Copolymers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward strategy is proposed for the synthesis of protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugates using one of the oldest polymers, the poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride). Different poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) copolymers were successfully prepared by RAFT polymerization in dioxane using the 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;propyl dodecyl trithiocarbonate as chain transfer agent (CTA) and AIBN as initiator. Original biomacromolecules were successfully prepared by post&#8208;polymerization modification.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugates have shown great promise in biomedical and life science applications including drug delivery and diagnosis. The current bioconjugation strategies suffer from lack of efficiency and versatility. In this article, poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) copolymers were first prepared by RAFT polymerization and characterized by different analytical techniques. Then, the poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) precursors were functionalized with primary amine such as azidopropylamine and amino poly(ethylene glycol). The reaction of amino compounds with maleic anhydride was found to be a highly efficient, a versatile, and a facile chemical ligation reaction for the synthesis of macromolecules with quantitative yield under mild conditions. The main benefit is the incorporation of a wide range of functionality by easily changing the primary amine compound. For the amphiphilic graft copolymers based on poly(ethylene glycol), aggregation behavior in water was investigated. In a second part, azido&#8208;functionalized polystyrene copolymers were used to prepare a new protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugate by copper&#8208;free click chemistry reaction.

         <dc:description>An eco&#8208;friendly bifunctional alkali&#8208;promoted gold&#8208;based catalyst with redox and basic properties for the oxidative dehydrogenative coupling of anilines to symmetrical and unsymmetrical aromatic azo compounds was developed. We realized a base additives/toxic oxidant&#8208;free, safer, and environmentally friendly process, with reasonable reusability of the catalyst achieved under milder reaction conditions. Notably, the enhanced catalytic activity was also linked to increased basic site concentration, low reduction temperatures, and the effect of lattice oxygen on the nanomaterials. The increased basic strength of the cation&#8208;promoted catalyst improved the electron density of the active Au species, resulting in faster desorption and a higher yield of the desired aromatic azo compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Labelled Spiro[3.3]heptane&#8208;Derived Building Blocks: Is Single Fluorine the Best?</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convergent synthesis of a series of mono&#8208; and bifunctional 6&#8208;fluoro&#8208;spiro[3.3]heptanes &#8211; advanced fluorine&#8208;labelled conformationally rigid building blocks for medicinal chemistry &#8211; is developed. The target products were obtained on a multigram scale (up to 302&#8197;g), characterized (pKa, LogP, and Sw), and assessed with the lead&#8208;likeness criteria.







Abstract
A reliable methodology for constructing 6&#8208;fluoro&#8208;spiro[3.3]heptane scaffold is developed. A vast library of 2&#8208;mono&#8208; and 2,2&#8208;difunctionalized 6&#8208;fluoro&#8208;spiro[3.3]heptane&#8208;derived building blocks were obtained in a multigram scale (up to 302&#8197;g) though the convergent synthetic strategy. This class of compounds was designed for medicinal chemistry as fluorine&#8208;labelled conformationally restricted isosteres of cyclohexane framework. The structure was confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction study, and the physico&#8208;chemical properties (acidity, lipophilicity and water solubility) were characterized.

&lt;p&gt;A convergent synthesis of a series of mono- and bifunctional 6-fluoro-spiro[3.3]heptanes &#8211; advanced fluorine-labelled conformationally rigid building blocks for medicinal chemistry &#8211; is developed. The target products were obtained on a multigram scale (up to 302&#8197;g), characterized (p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;, Log&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;, and S&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;), and assessed with the lead-likeness criteria.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reliable methodology for constructing 6-fluoro-spiro[3.3]heptane scaffold is developed. A vast library of 2-mono- and 2,2-difunctionalized 6-fluoro-spiro[3.3]heptane-derived building blocks were obtained in a multigram scale (up to 302&#8197;g) though the convergent synthetic strategy. This class of compounds was designed for medicinal chemistry as fluorine-labelled conformationally restricted isosteres of cyclohexane framework. The structure was confirmed by X-ray diffraction study, and the physico-chemical properties (acidity, lipophilicity and water solubility) were characterized. Finally, the generation of virtual compound libraries using the LLAMA software showed that the monofluorinated spiro[3.3]heptane-derived building blocks demonstrated the highest propensity to populate the lead-like chemical space as compared to non- and difluorinated counterparts, as well as cyclohexane derivatives, while retaining similar three-dimensionality features.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of 4,7,12,15&#8208;Tetrasubstituted [2.2]Paracyclophanes: A Modular Route Involving Optical Resolution</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a practical synthetic method for preparing bis&#8208;(  para  )&#8208;  pseudo  &#8208;  ortho  and bis&#8208;(  para  )&#8208;  pseudo  &#8208;  meta  type 4,7,12,15&#8208;tetrasubstituted [2.2]paracyclophanes. Regioselective double Rieche formylation was successfully applied to the corresponding dibromo[2.2]paracyclophanes under slightly modified conditions. Aldehydes reacted in an unknown direction with Rieche formylation agents, dichloromethyl methyl ether and titanium (IV) tetrachloride, leading to the formation of benzal chlorides. Formylated products were obtained after hydrolysis of these benzal chloride derivatives. Optical resolution was performed with the diastereomer method and (  R  P  )&#8208; 4,12&#8208;dibromo&#8208;7,15&#8208;diformyl[2.2]paracyclophane was successfully obtained in an enantiomerically pure form (99%  ee  ). Their synthetic utility is demonstrated with some exploratory transformations to access corresponding differently functionalized tetrasubstituted [2.2]paracyclophane derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Synthesis of a Hexapeptide by Fragment Coupling in a Ball Mill</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of long peptides is generally considered as being a challenge to peptide chemists, in addition to producing significant amounts of toxic waste, such as DMF. Here we show that using solvent&#8208;less methods, such as ball milling, enabled the production of the hexapeptide Boc&#8208;(Ala&#8208;Phe&#8208;Gly)  2  &#8208;OBn at the gram scale with high overall yield (77%, 5 linear steps). This is the longest peptide chain synthesized in a ball mill to date, in which the amino acid sequence is precisely controlled. This study complements the current fundamental knowledge required to synthesize longer and more difficult peptide chains (or small proteins) by using peptide fragment couplings in a ball mill.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, a series of &#945;&#8208;amino acids (L&#8208;Phe, D&#8208;Phe, L&#8208;Trp) and several &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dipeptides (H2N&#8208;L&#8208;Val&#8208;N&#8208;Bn&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Ala&#8208;COOH and H2N&#8208;L&#8208;Leu&#8208;N&#8208;Bn&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Ala&#8208;COOH) intercalated into hydrotalcite (Mg/Al, x = 0.333) were prepared by high speed ball milling (HSBM) assisted rehydration/reconstruction methods, followed of sonication and mechanical stirring. All organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid samples were characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and FTIR&#8208;ATR spectroscopy. The catalytic activity of the resulting hydrotalcite&#8208;supported materials (natural and hybrid) was evaluated in the asymmetric Michael addition reaction of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;aldehydes to N&#8208;substituted&#8208;maleimides. Pristine (HTS), calcined (HTC) and water&#8208;reconstructed (HTR&#8208;l) hydrotalcite&#8208;derived materials exhibited very low catalytic activities, affording racemic mixtures of the anticipated Michael adduct. By contrast, hybrid materials showed better activities, especially HTR&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid catalysts afforded Michael products in up to 94% yield and with rather high enantioselectivity (enantiomeric ratio, e.r., up to 99:1) at room temperature under neat reaction conditions. The effect of solvents and Br&#248;nsted basic or acidic additives was evaluated using the best hybrid catalyst, HTR&#8208;L&#8208;Phe. In addition, recycling and reuse of the catalyst (up to 4 cycles) and large&#8208;scale experiments was successfully carried out.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem Nenitzescu reaction/nucleophilic aromatic substitution to form novel pyrido fused indole frameworks</title>

         <dc:description>5&#8208;Hydroxyindoles are privileged structures that form part of various bioactive compounds. The Nenitzescu reaction of quinones and enamines is one of the most powerful methods to obtain 5&#8208;hydroxyindoles. In this work, we have applied the Nenitzescu reaction to 2&#8208;(2&#8208;chloropyrid&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzoquinones. Mixtures of regioisomers were obtained that could be separated in the 4&#8208; and 6&#8208;substituted analogues, and then cyclized separately in a metal&#8208;free base&#8208;catalyzed reaction, affording novel tetracyclic indole derivatives. These are indeed the first examples reported in the literature of the &#8203;linear pyrido[3',&#8203;2':4,&#8203;5]&#8203;furo[3,&#8203;2&#8208;&#8203; b ]&#8203;indole and angular 1 H &#8208;&#8203;pyrido[2',&#8203;3':4,&#8203;5]&#8203;furo[2,&#8203;3&#8208;&#8203; c ]&#8203;indole systems. The regioselectivity and the yield of the Nenitzescu reaction was found to be dependent on the N &#8208;substituent at the enamine. Furthermore, we analysed the UV&#8208;Vis and PL spectra of the new systems, and this was supported by DFT calculations, allowing to compare the properties of angular compared to linearly shaped compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Indoles by Reductive Cyclization of Nitro Compounds Using Formate Esters as CO Surrogates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkyl and aryl formate esters were evaluated as CO sources in the Pd&#8208; and Pd/Ru&#8208;catalyzed reductive cyclization of 2&#8208;nitrostyrenes to give indoles. Whereas the use of alkyl formates requires the presence of a ruthenium catalyst such as Ru3(CO)12, the reaction with phenyl formate can be performed by using a Pd/phenanthroline complex alone. Phenyl formate was found to be the most effective CO source, allowing to obtain the desired products in excellent yields, often higher than those previously reported with pressurized CO. The reaction tolerates many functional groups, including sensitive ones like a free aldehydic group or a pendant pyrrole. Detailed experiments and kinetic studies discern between a metal&#8208;catalyzed and a base&#8208;mediated activation of phenyl formate confirming that just the base is effective in catalyzing its decarbonylation. The reactions can be performed in a single thick&#8208;walled glass tube with as little as 0.2 mol&#8208;% palladium catalyst and even on a 2 g scale.

Whereas the use of alkyl formates requires the presence of a ruthenium catalyst such as Ru3(CO)12, the reaction with phenyl formate can be performed by using a Pd/phenanthroline complex alone. Phenyl formate was found to be the most effective CO source, allowing to obtain the desired products in excellent yields, often higher than those previously reported with pressurized CO. The reaction tolerates many functional groups, including sensitive ones like a free aldehydic group or a pendant pyrrole. Detailed experiments and kinetic studies discern between a metal-catalyzed and a base-mediated activation of phenyl formate confirming that just the base is effective in catalyzing its decarbonylation. The reactions can be performed in a single thick-walled glass tube with as little as 0.2 mol-% palladium catalyst and even on a 2 g scale. The same protocol can be extended to other nitro compounds, affording different heterocycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Critical ligand and salt effects in organomagnesiate&#8208;promoted 3,3&#8208;disubstituted phthalides synthesis from 2&#8208;iodobenzoate derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phthalides, also called isobenzofuranones, are widespread in many biologically active compounds and natural products. To date, most of their synthetic routes are non&#8208;convergent. Herein we report a convergent route using a metal halogen exchange (MHE) strategy. Indeed MHE of easily available 2&#8208;iodobenzoate derivatives, using the bimetallic organomagnesiate complex (rac)&#8208;(BIPHEN)BuMgLi, where (rac)&#8208;BIPHEN is (rac)&#8208;5,5',6,6'&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;3,3'&#8208;di&#8208; t &#8208;butyl&#8208;1,1'&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;2,2'&#8208;diol, followed by addition of a ketone which lead to an intramolecular cyclisation, and the formation of a series of diverse 3,3&#8208;disubstituted isobenzofuranones in good yield. Among the several MHE agents investigated, (rac)&#8208;(BIPHEN)BuMgLi was the only one to make such a process possible with full tolerance of various reactive functional substituents useful for subsequent transformations. The synthetic pathway to access the magnesiate has been found to play a prominent role in its reactivity. Therefore, the bimetallic magnesiate complex has been characterized by solution&#8208;state 1H, 7Li and 1H DOSY NMR experiments.</dc:description>

Negative solvatochromism was found and temperature&#8208;dependent as well as time&#8208;resolved fluorescence measurements were made. Long lifetimes of the excited states (30 &#8208; 50 ns) were detected.

         <title>Alkylation of electron&#8208;deficient olefins through conjugate addition of organozinc reagents: An update</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review focuses on the applications of organozinc reagents in conjugate addition reactions. Organozinc compounds are a class of organometallic reagent used in various reactions like addition, substitution and coupling reactions. The conjugate addition or 1, 4&#8208;addition is one of the most useful bond forming strategies used in organic synthesis since broad range of nucleophiles can be employed in the reaction. Addition of organozinc to electron&#8208;deficient olefins attracts synthetic chemists as it preferably undergoes conjugate addition over 1,2&#8208;addition unlike other organometallic reagents, such as Grignard reagent or organolithium. Many natural products were also synthesized by applying the conjugate addition reaction of organozinc. Moreover, organozinc reagents have superior functional group compatibility and can be easily prepared relative to other organometallic compounds. Consequently, conjugate additions of organozinc reagents were highly studied and having a review on it is very important at present. Though a few reviews are available, they are either not directly on the organozinc reagents or on the conjugate addition. We hope that this review article will be of great use to organic researchers.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>d  &#8208;Xylose is a special monosaccharide found in various organisms, which is characterized by conformational dynamics between different pyranose ring forms depending on the substitution pattern. With a perspective to study the conformational equilibria of xylosides and eventually use them as conformational switches, we sought an entry into a flexible synthesis of 2,4&#8208;diamino&#8208;xylosides. In particular, we synthesized 4&#8208;bromophenyl 2,4&#8208;diamino&#8208;3&#8208;  O  &#8208;(4&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;  d  &#8208;xyloside from  l  &#8208;arabinose utilizing a concomitant epimerization and differentiation at position 4 and iodosulfonamidation of a difunctional xylal at a later stage of the synthetic pathway. This strategy provides xylose derivatives with high stereochemical precision and a high degree of functionalization. The obtained xylose derivatives are of interest as conformational hinge molecules and as orthogonally protected triamino scaffold molecules.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present work describes the preparation of halohydrins from 2&#8208;halocyclobutanones by means of reactions with Grignard reagents at &#8208;78 &#176;C. We discovered that the prepared cyclobutanols underwent a thermal ring&#8208;opening reaction. Depending on the structure of the starting cyclobutanol, different products were formed. More specifically, 1&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;bromocyclobutan&#8208;1&#8208;ol was found to open to &#947;&#8208;substituted butyrophenones. A novel 1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;inden&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene derivative was obtained for indene&#8208;derived cyclobutanols. Based on the outcomes of the performed experiments, a mechanism for the ring&#8208;opening of cyclobutanols can be proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of the Substituent and Amino Group Position on the Lipase&#8208;Catalyzed Resolution of &#947;&#8208;Amino Esters: A Molecular Docking Study Shedding Light on CaLB Enantioselectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The kinetic resolution of N&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl g&#8208;amino methyl esters bearing different stereocenters at alpha (&#947;2), beta (&#947;3), or gamma (&#947;4) positions was carried out by enantioselective hydrolysis with Candida antarctica lipase B (CaLB) in 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;butanol solvent. The results show that the process is significantly less enantioselective for the &#947;2&#8208;amino methyl ester (E = 2.5), the &#947;3&#8208;amino methyl ester (E = 7.6), and the &#947;4&#8208;amino methyl ester (E = 8.3) when compared with the kinetic resolution of analogous N&#8208;protected &#946;3&#8208;amino esters (E &gt; 80). Based on these results, molecular docking studies were carried out, through which particular regions in the CaLB catalytic cavity were analyzed. The steric exclusion region composed of Ile189 and Val190 residues, together with the amino bonding region that induces a hydrogen bond with the Asp134 residue, appear to be responsible for the high selectivity in the resolution of carboxylic acid derivatives with beta stereocenters. This interaction is well preserved for &#946;&#8208;amino esters as substrates. By contrast, &#947;&#8208;amino esters exhibit greater conformational diversity, so the effectiveness of the interaction is reduced, which apparently is responsible for the loss of enantioselectivity in the resolution process.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The kinetic resolution of N-tert-butoxycarbonyl g-amino methyl esters bearing different stereocenters at alpha (&#947;2), beta (&#947;3), or gamma (&#947;4) positions was carried out by enantioselective hydrolysis with Candida antarctica lipase B (CaLB) in 2-methyl-2-butanol solvent. The results show that the process is significantly less enantioselective for the &#947;2-amino methyl ester (E = 2.5), the &#947;3-amino methyl ester (E = 7.6), and the &#947;4-amino methyl ester (E = 8.3) when compared with the kinetic resolution of analogous N-protected &#946;3-amino esters (E &amp;gt; 80).

         <dc:description>The present review describes the homogenous catalytic methodologies for the synthesis of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridines involving C&#8211;C bond formation from C&#8211;H bond. There are three main approaches to build well&#8208;decorated 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridines from C&#8211;H bond cleavage: i) the formation of C2&#8211;C2' bond  via  the dimerization of (activated) pyridines, ii) the C&#8211;H bond heteroarylation of activated pyridine, or iii) the late&#8208;stage functionalization of (activated) 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridines including photoredox processes. Besides the scope and limitation of each methodologies, the relevant mechanisms of reaction are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Flexible Synthesis and Herbicidal Activity of Fully Substituted 3&#8208;Hydroxypyrazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and herbicidal efficacy of a novel library of fully substituted 3&#8208;hydroxypyrazoles is reported. A final step diversification approach was employed to efficiently introduce various substituents in the 1&#8208; and 4&#8208;positions of the pyrazole. A scalable, multi&#8208;gram synthesis of the lead compound is also described.







Abstract
The synthesis and herbicidal efficacy of a novel library of fully substituted 3&#8208;hydroxypyrazoles is reported. An efficient, divergent approach to introduce phenyl, phenoxy, phenylsulfanyl, anilino and benzyl substituents in the 4&#8208;position of the pyrazole, alongside a flexible synthesis of N1&#8208;alkyl analogues is described via final step diversification of key intermediates. Herbicidal screening of the prepared compounds against key weed species identified the lead compound 2&#8208;[4&#8208;(2,4&#8208;difluorophenoxy)&#8208;1,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl]oxy&#8208;5&#8208;fluoropyrimidine, which was prepared on a multi&#8208;gram scale using an optimised synthetic route.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Norbornadienes via in situ Cracking of Dicyclopentadiene using Continuous Flow Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The norbornadiene (NBD)&#8208;quadricyclane (QC) photoswitch has recently attracted attention due to its use in molecular solar thermal energy systems (MOST). Normally for device testing, several grams are needed. One way of synthesizing NBDs efficiently is through the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between alkynes and cyclopentadiene. However, scaling up the reaction can be troublesome in a research lab environment. Also, dicyclopentadiene needs cracking before utilization as a time&#8208;consuming step. Here, we developed a method where we both scale up the synthesis in a single reaction step that involves both  in situ  cracking of dicyclopentadiene and direct reaction of cyclopentadiene with acetylene derivatives using a tubular coiled stainless steel flow reactor. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we synthesized 6 different NBD compounds, and scaled the synthesis to produce 87 g of a novel NBD in 9 h. The NBD is further characterized, showing promising properties for MOST applications. Our new method shows that flow chemistry is an attractive technique for the fast and efficient synthesis of large quantities of NBDs, needed to develop future real&#8208;life devices and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation of Lactams from Cyclic Anhydrides via N&#8208;Carboxyanhydride Intermediates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic anhydrides can be readily converted to ring&#8208;contracted lactams after sequential silylazidation, protonolysis, Curtius rearrangement and catalysis of ring closure by DMAP, in an operationally simple procedure. Succinic anhydrides do not form ring&#8208;contracted &#946;&#8208;lactams but instead generate &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides which serve as activated analogues of &#946;&#8208;amino acids of use in &#946;&#8208;peptide and polymer chemistry.







Abstract
The ring contraction&#8208;lactamisation of anhydrides upon reaction with trimethylsilylazide in the presence of an amine catalyst has been studied. Under controlled conditions, 5,&#8208; 6&#8208; and 8&#8208;membered ring lactams can be generated from cyclic anhydrides in an operationally simple procedure. In the case of &#947;&#8208;lactams, the methodology allows for the synthesis of challenging systems incompatible with the usual disconnection involving an amine and an activated carbonyl group. The synthesis of simple larger ring lactams is hampered by inaccessible monomeric cyclic anhydride precursors &#8208; a problem which can be circumvented through rigidification. Succinic anhydrides make N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides of use in polymer chemistry and as &#946;&#8208;peptide precursors.

         <title>Compounds combining a macrocyclic building block and flexible side&#8208;arms as carbohydrate receptors: syntheses and structure&#8208;binding activity relationship studies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of new representatives of compounds combining a macrocyclic building block and flexible side&#8208;arms were prepared and their ability to act as carbohydrate receptors evaluated. The target compounds were obtained via multi&#8208;step syntheses, which included the preparation of numerous precursors as well as the isolation of a large number of by&#8208;products. The structure&#8208;binding activity relationship studies comprise in particular the variation of the side&#8208;arms in order to demonstrate the importance of the presence of a hydrogen bond donor in these units for the effective complexation of carbohydrates. Based on the findings of our previous studies, the variation of the bridge units is limited to benzene&#8208; and pyrrole&#8208;based moieties, whereby the use of the last&#8208;mentioned bridge type was expected to produce more effective systems. This assumption was confirmed by  1  H NMR titrations and isothermal titration calorimetry.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Lactams by Reductive Amination of Carbonyl Derivatives with &#969;&#8208;Amino Fatty Acids under Hydrosilylation Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented efficient method for the reductive amination of carbonyl derivatives with &#969;&#8208;amino fatty acids under hydrosilylation conditions was developed leading to the corresponding lactams. A variety of pyrrolidinones, piperidinones, 2&#8208;azepanones were prepared in up to 95&#8201;% isolated yields (29 examples).







Abstract
An efficient method for the preparation of lactams from &#969;&#8208;amino fatty acids under hydrosilylation is described. A variety of lactams such as pyrrolidinones, piperidinones and 2&#8208;azepanones were selectively synthesised in moderate to excellent yields (29 examples, up to 95&#8201;% isolated yields) with a good functional group tolerance.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient method for the preparation of lactams from &lt;i&gt;&#969;-&lt;/i&gt;amino fatty acids under hydrosilylation is described. A variety of lactams such as pyrrolidinones, piperidinones and 2-azepanones were selectively synthesised in moderate to excellent yields (29 examples, up to 95&#8201;% isolated yields) with a good functional group tolerance. Notably, no metallic based catalyst was required to perform this transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis and Functionalization of C6/C7 Substituted Pyrido[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted pyrido[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidines are accessible by a reaction sequence consisting of HWE&#8208;reaction, a Z/E&#8208;photoisomerization, and ring closure of the pyridine ring. Bis&#8208;pyridopyrimidines can be obtained from 7&#8208;amino&#8208;pyrido[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidines.







Abstract
An efficient synthesis of functionalized pyrido[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidines is reported. Starting from 4&#8208;aminopyrimidine&#8208;3&#8208;carbaldehydes, a Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons olefination followed by a photoisomerization/cyclization installed the fused pyridine ring. Using substituted HWE&#8208;reagents various substituents could be introduced in the 7&#8208;position of the pyrido[3,2&#8208;d]pyrimidines. Functionalization of the pyridone substructure allowed late variation in the 6&#8208;position. In order to obtain amine&#8208;linked bis&#8208;pyridopyrimidines, 7&#8208;bromo&#8208;pyridopyrimidines were converted with their 7&#8208;amino&#8208;counterpart by Hartwig&#8211;Buchwald amination.

         <title>Aryl Fluoroalkyl Sulfoxides: Optical Stability and pKa Measurement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Key properties of chiral aryl fluoroalkyl sulfoxides with strong synthetic potential were studied. After resolution by enantioselective chromatography, their optical stability was investigated by thermal enantiomerization via enantioselective chromatography. Their &#916;G&#8800; values range from 38.2 to 41.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at 214&#8201;&#176;C. In addition, the pKa values of six aryl difluoromethyl sulfoxides were determined via indirect UV&#8208;visible spectrophotometric titrations in DMSO and are in the range of 20.3&#8211;22.5.







Abstract
The enantiomeric separation of aryl trifluoromethyl and difluoromethyl sulfoxides was realized via chiral chromatography. The configurational stability of each set of enantiomers was then studied by thermal enantiomerization. The &#916;G&#8800; values obtained cover a range of 38.2&#8211;41.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at 214&#8201;&#176;C, thus demonstrating their optical stability at room temperature. However, a shorter half&#8208;life time has been observed for difluoromethyl sulfoxides. Furthermore, the acidities of six aryl difluoromethyl sulfoxides were determined in DMSO by an overlapping indicator method using UV&#8208;visible spectrophotometric titrations. The pKa values fall in range of 20.3&#8211;22.5 and differ by about 10&#8197;log units compared to non&#8208;fluorinated analogues.

         <title>A Scalable High&#8208;Yielding and Selective Oxidative Heck Cross&#8208;Coupling &#8211; A Key Step for the Synthesis of trans&#8208;Stilbenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;step synthesis leading to the trans&#8208;stilbene molecular scaffold was successfully designed and performed. In order to carry out this synthetic pathway, a highly selective and high yielding oxidative Heck cross&#8208;coupling method was developed and optimized. A trans&#8208;stilbene derivative [(E)&#8208;5&#8208;(2&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid]] required in a medicinal chemistry project was successfully up&#8208;scaled (&gt;1000&#215;) and exploited for the production of the substance on a multi&#8208;gram (150&#8197;g) scale.







Abstract
A selective oxidative Heck cross&#8208;coupling method was developed and optimized as a pivotal step for a synthetic route leading to the trans&#8208;stilbene framework. The developed method and synthesis were needed in a SAR study in progress that concerned design and development of an inhibitor for the human cell xCT antiporter system. The developed oxidative Heck cross&#8208;coupling method was examined with a variety of substrates and reagents to produce a library of different substituted trans&#8208;stilbenes, which revealed the method to hold a very good tolerance for an assortment of functional groups. The final synthetic route was successfully scaled&#8208;up (from mg scale) and performed in a 150&#8197;g (&gt;1000&#215;up&#8208;scaled) batch run to obtain an overall yield of 73&#8201;% (over three steps), which corresponds to a mean step yield of 90&#8201;%. The inhibitor candidate DC10 [(E)&#8208;5&#8208;(2&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;benzoic acid] was produced in multi&#8208;gram quantities (&#8776;33&#8197;g) that subsequently was forwarded for animal efficacy and toxicology studies. The scaled&#8208;up process constitutes the first example of an oxidative Heck cross&#8208;coupling on &gt;100&#8208;gram scale.

         <dc:description>
Achieving control over the diastereoselectivity of 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions to obtain maximum number of diastereomers under simple operation is an enduring challenge. In this work, the diastereodivergent 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated arylketones and azomethine ylides was studied experimentally and theoretically. The reaction produced pyrrolidines (endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;adducts under Ag(I) and Cu(II) catalysis respectively) with four contiguous stereogenic centers bearing a fluorinated quaternary stereogenic center at C4.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Dipolar cycloaddition of &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated arylketones and azomethine ylides has been experimentally and theoretically investigated. The reaction proceeded in a diastereodivergent fashion: in contrast to our previous results where exo&#8208;adducts were obtained under Cu(II) catalysis, herein we have achieved the endo&#8208;selective 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition using Ag(I) catalyst. Theoretical DFT calculations have been performed to understand the origin of diastereoselectivity switch, possible mechanism, and geometrical features of organometallic intermediates of both catalytic processes. The free&#8208;energy profiles suggested that the Michael addition step is the rate determining step, and the coordination between silver atom and carbonyl oxygen atom of enone is the driving force behind endo&#8208;selectivity.

     alt="Diastereodivergent 1,3-Dipolar Cycloaddition of &#945;-Fluoro-&#945;,&#946;-Unsaturated Arylketones and Azomethine Ylides: Experimental and Theoretical DFT Studies"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving control over the diastereoselectivity of 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions to obtain maximum number of diastereomers under simple operation is an enduring challenge. In this work, the diastereodivergent 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of &#945;-fluoro-&#945;,&#946;-unsaturated arylketones and azomethine ylides was studied experimentally and theoretically. The reaction produced pyrrolidines (&lt;i&gt;endo-&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;exo-&lt;/i&gt;adducts under Ag(I) and Cu(II) catalysis respectively) with four contiguous stereogenic centers bearing a fluorinated quaternary stereogenic center at C4.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1,3-Dipolar cycloaddition of &#945;-fluoro-&#945;,&#946;-unsaturated arylketones and azomethine ylides has been experimentally and theoretically investigated. The reaction proceeded in a diastereodivergent fashion: in contrast to our previous results where &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-adducts were obtained under Cu(II) catalysis, herein we have achieved the &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;-selective 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition using Ag(I) catalyst. Theoretical DFT calculations have been performed to understand the origin of diastereoselectivity switch, possible mechanism, and geometrical features of organometallic intermediates of both catalytic processes. The free-energy profiles suggested that the Michael addition step is the rate determining step, and the coordination between silver atom and carbonyl oxygen atom of enone is the driving force behind &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Azaphilone pigments from Hypoxylon rubiginosum and H.&#160;texense: absolute configuration, bioactivity, and biosynthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report new stromatal azaphilone pigments rubiginosins D&#8722;F from the ascomycete  Hypoxylon rubiginosum  , and rubiginosins D and G from  H.&#160;texense  , along with known monomeric and dimeric congeners. Structures were elucidated using comprehensive HRMS, NMR, and ECD analysis, revealing azaphilones from both fungi to be exclusively C&#8209;8(  S  )&#8208;configured. The orsellinic acid (OA)&#8208;carrying rubiginosins A, D and dimeric rutilins A&#8722;B exhibited cytotoxicity, while rubiginosins F&#8722;G bearing linear polyketide side chains and rutilins A&#8722;B were antimicrobial. Structures of the differently&#8208;substituted azaphilones were linked to two putative biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs;  hraza1  /  2  ) in  H.&#160;rubiginosum  , which are proposed to collaboratively synthesize the OA&#8208;substituted azaphilones. These share high homology with the azaphilone&#8208;forming BGCs  hfaza1  /  2  from  H.&#160;fragiforme  . Comparison of  hraza  and  hfaza  suggests that lack of an FAD&#8208;dependent monooxygenase and acyltransferase gene in  hraza1  prevent formation of C&#8208;8(  R  )&#8208;configured fatty acid&#8208;substituted azaphilones in  H.&#160;rubiginosum  . The polyketide synthase&#8208;derived side chain of rubiginosins C and F&#8722;G is not encoded in the respective BGCs, showing that a third BGC is hypothetically involved in their formation. Cross&#8208;interaction of three BGCs forming a single molecule is unprecedented in fungal natural product biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Supported Synthesis of Adenosine Nucleotides and Derivatives on a Benzene&#8208;Centered Tripodal Soluble Support</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy based on anchoring C(6) azidopurine nucleoside derivative to a tripodal soluble support allows to access the corresponding adenosine nucleotides. We extended the scope of the method to methylene bisphosphonate analogues and N6&#8208;benzylamine derivative.







Abstract
The first soluble&#8208;phase synthesis of adenosine nucleotides including &#945;,&#946; and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;methylene bisphosphonate analogues on a multi&#8208;pod support is reported. Anchoring of a 2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;protected purine nucleoside to the tripodal support via the nucleobase was successfully achieved using a microwave assisted Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition. Then, phosphorylation was performed, followed by cleavage with aqueous ammonia to provide adenine derivatives, and finally deprotection. When using benzylamine instead of ammonia, a derivative with N6&#8208;benzylamine adenine as nucleobase was obtained. This methodology allows to access adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;mono, di and triphosphates, as well as various analogues of pharmacological interest in modest to good yields.

         <title>Heteroaliphatic Dimethylphosphine Oxide Building Blocks: Synthesis and Physico&#8208;Chemical Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multigram synthesis of saturated heterocyclic dimethylphosphine oxides (derivatives of azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, and morpholine) &#8211; advanced building blocks for medicinal chemistry &#8211; as well as their physico&#8208;chemical properties (pKa, logP, and Sw) are disclosed.







Abstract
Scalable synthesis of saturated heterocyclic dimethyl phosphine oxides (derivatives of azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, and morpholine) is disclosed. The key steps of the synthesis relied on the reactions of HP(O)Me2, i.&#8201;e. the phospha&#8208;Mannich (the Kabachnik&#8208;Fields&#8208;type) condensation with cyclic imines or monoprotected diamines, palladium&#8208;catalyzed reactions of alkenyl halides or trifltates (generated from cyclic ketones), as well as base&#8208;mediated nucleophilic substitution, Michael addition, or oxirane ring opening. It was shown that introducing the P(O)Me2 group into the saturated heterocyclic core had very strong impact on the compound's basicity: the corresponding &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;isomeric derivatives were by ca. 4, 2, and 1.6&#8197;pKa units less basic, respectively, as compared to the parent saturated heterocycle. Meanwhile, the P(O)Me2&#8208;substituted compound was more basic than its SO2i&#8208;Pr and SO2NMe2&#8208;containing isosteres (by ca. 1.2 and 0.4&#8197;pKa units, respectively). It was also demonstrated that the P(O)Me2 group typically increased the compound's hydrophilicity and aqueous solubility. In particular, the LogP values for the corresponding derivatives were by ca. 1.4&#8211;1.7 and 0.6&#8197;units lower than for the non&#8208;substituted counterpart and sulfonamide/sulfone isosteres, respectively. Finally, a potential of the synthesized building blocks to generate lead&#8208;like three&#8208;dimensional compound libraries was confirmed using the Nelson's LLAMA tool.

A robust gram&#8208;scale synthesis, physico&#8208;chemical characterization, and lead&#8208;likeness assessment of novel 4&#8208;di/trifluoromethyl&#8208;2&#8208;heterabicyclo[2.1.1]hexane building blocks as fluorinated 2,4&#8208;methanoproline analogues and phenyl isosteres are disclosed.







Abstract
A gram&#8208;scale synthesis, physico&#8208;chemical characterization, and lead&#8208;likeness assessment of 4&#8208;di/trifluoromethyl&#8208;2&#8208;heterabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes as fluorinated bicyclic proline analogues and phenyl isosteres are disclosed. The key step of the synthesis included iodocyclization of fluorinated 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;/3&#8208;aminomethyl methylenecyclobutanes; with the amino derivatives, the reaction was accompanied with carboxylation and further cyclization. Apart from the corresponding 4&#8208;di/trifluoromethyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;methanoprolines, a series of fluorinated oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexane&#8208;derived building blocks relevant to medicinal chemistry (i.&#8201;e. primary iodides, carboxylic acids, alcohols, azides, primary amines, sulfonyl chlorides, and alkynes) were prepared. For representative derivatives of the resulting fluorinated 2&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes, pKa and logP values were measured to clarify their potential as the possible phenyl isosteres. Apart from the somewhat increased acidity, fine&#8208;tuned lipophilicity intermediate between that of non&#8208;fluorinated or aromatic counterparts was observed. Finally, the potential of the title building blocks was demonstrated by generation of virtual compound libraries using the LLAMA software. The resulting libraries fitted perfectly the lead&#8208;like chemical space, had higher three&#8208;dimensionality, and showed lower mean lead&#8208;likeness penalty as compared to those obtained from either non&#8208;fluorinated or aromatic derivatives.

         <title>Functionalized 5&#8208;Amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles, their Hetero&#8208; and Macrocyclic Derivatives: Preparation and Synthetic Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach for the synthesis of new 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles with carboxylate group at the C&#8208;2 position, connected to the heterocycle directly or through an aliphatic linker, was developed. This process features readily available starting materials, simple operations, and good to high yields. Wide synthetic applicability of the obtained compounds was also successfully demonstrated by further modifications.







Abstract
An approach to a series of new 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles is described. Synthesis of the title compounds relied on a two&#8208;step sequence including heterocyclization of 2&#8208;amido&#8208;3,3&#8208;dichloroacrylonitriles with aliphatic secondary amines (dimethylamine, morpholine), primary aliphatic amines with active functional groups (2&#8208;aminoethanol and glycine ethyl ester), and aniline. An efficient and straightforward protocol introduces a carboxylate group at the C&#8208;2 position of 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoxazoles, connected to the heterocycle directly or through an aliphatic linker. This carboxylic group is an attractive motif that can be found in a variety of drug&#8208;relevant compounds and also used for further modifications. Furthermore, efficient transformations of selected trisubstituted compounds were used to demonstrate their rich synthetic potential &#8211; e.&#8201;g., as precursors to 2&#8208;(4&#8208;cyano&#8208;5&#8208;(dimethylamino)oxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetamides, oxazole&#8208;containing macrocyclic structures, 2&#8208;(oxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetamides, amino pyrazoles, 3&#8208;(4&#8208;cyano&#8208;5&#8208;aminoxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)coumarins, and oxazole amino acids.

         <title>Monoprotected Diamines Derived from 1,5&#8208;Disubstituted (Aza)spiro[2.3]hexane Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted (aza)spiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. Structural characterization of the obtained spirocyclic compounds provided a rationale for their applications in design of saturated ring isosteres and peptidomimetics.







Abstract
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted spiro[2.3]hexane and 5&#8208;azaspiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. In both cases, the method relied on the cyclopropanation of the corresponding cyclobutane or azetidine derivatives. In the case of monoprotected 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexanes, the title products were obtained as single diastereomers. X&#8208;Ray diffraction studies supported by exit vector plot (EVP) analysis showed that the obtained building blocks are promising piperidine/cycloalkane isosteres with potential utility to drug discovery. Also, conformations observed in the crystalline state for the two different diastereomers of 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexane derivatives prompt their application in design of &#946;&#8208;turn and sheet&#8208;like peptidomimetics, respectively.

         <title>Last of the gem&#8208;Difluorocycloalkanes 2: Synthesis of Fluorinated Cycloheptane Building Blocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isomeric gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane derivatives were obtained in two to six synthetic steps from readily available starting materials. The developed synthetic approaches were shown to be efficient for a multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of target compounds and involved six&#8208;membered ring homologation and/or deoxofluorination reactions as the key steps.







Abstract
The gem&#8208;difluorocycloalkane family was extended to all possible regioisomers of the gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane, monofunctionalized by carboxilic&#8208;, amino&#8208; or keto&#8208; group, that were synthesized on a multigram scale. The preparation of the corresponding building blocks was achieved from readily accessible starting materials either via six&#8208;membered ring homologation or deoxofluorination of the appropriate seven&#8208;membered cyclic ketones.

         <title>Reaction of N,N&#8208;Disubstituted Polyfluoroalkanethioamides with Diazomethane: Entry to New Thiirane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4&#8208;dioxane derivatives are discussed.






New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between N,N&#8208;disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

  Multigram synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates relying on efficient 4&#8211;5&#8208;step reaction sequences is described. The title compounds was obtained in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield).
  
  
  
  
 
 
  An approach to the synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates on a multigram scale was developed. Two synthetic strategies were evaluated: the first based on the lithiation&#8211;borylation of the corresponding 2&#8208;bromoallyl derivatives, and the other relying on regioselective hydroboration of the appropriate hetera&#8208;substituted enynes. The second method appeared to be more efficient in terms of scalability and substrate scope. Further steps included ring closing&#8208;metathesis, mild palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation with diazomethane, and reaction with KHF2 and furnished the title compounds in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield, 4&#8211;5 steps).

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;Sultams by One&#8208;Pot Reductive Cyclization of Cyanoalkylsulfonyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
  A multigram synthesis of spirocyclic &#947;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;sultams is reported, which are advanced building blocks for organic synthesis and drug discovery. The synthesis proceeds through a one&#8208;pot reductive cyclization of cyclic cyano sulfonyl fluorides.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  One&#8208;pot intramolecular cyclization of novel sp3&#8208;enriched cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluorides into spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;sultams is disclosed. The method relies on nitrile group reduction followed by sulfonylation of amino group thus formed upon mild conditions (NaBH4, NiCl2&#183;6H2O in MeOH). Cyclization proceeds smoothly with considerable efficiency (48&#8211;84&#8201;%, 10 examples) on up to 30 g scale. The cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluoride intermediates can be obtained via S&#8208;nucleophilic substitution in &#946;&#8208;functionalized alkanenitriles or double alkylation of &#945;&#8208;alkylthioacetonitrile, followed by oxidative chlorination with Cl2 and further reaction with KHF2. The title mono&#8208; and bifunctional sultams are advanced sp3&#8208;enriched building blocks for drug discovery and organic synthesis providing novel substitution patterns and frameworks mimicking saturated nitrogen heterocycles such as pyrrolidine/pyrrolidone.
