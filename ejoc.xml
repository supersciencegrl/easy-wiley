         <title>An Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission&#8208;Based Fluorescence Turn&#8208;On Probe for Efficient Detection of HS&#8722; in Water, Wine, and Living Cells</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 18, May 8, 2023. </description>

Probe TPA&#8208;M exhibits excellent response to HS&#8722; with high selectivity, remarkable anti&#8208;interference ability, rapid response time (&lt;10&#8197;min) and low detection limit (5.64&#215;10&#8722;8&#8197;M) in THF/H2O (2/8, v/v, HEPES=20&#8197;mM, pH=7.3), and has been successfully applied to practically detect hydrogen sulfide in water, wine, and living cells.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), as one of the important endogenous biological regulators, plays a critical role in mediating a wide range of physiological processes. The development of rapid, sensitive, and reliable detection techniques for H2S would be highly appealing. In this paper, a new type of AIE&#8208;based fluorescence turn&#8208;on probe TPA&#8208;M for the detection of H2S has been constructed, involved the rapid release of AIE&#8208;based fluorophore TPA&#8208;CHO with a remarkable fluorescence turn&#8208;on phenomenon in THF/H2O (2/8, v/v, HEPES=20&#8197;&#956;M, pH=7.3) medium, exhibiting the attractive advantages such as high sensitivity with the detection limit as low as 1.92&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;ppm, excellent selectivity over other anion analytes and biothiols, significant anti&#8208;interference ability and fast response time (within 10&#8197;min). What's more, the practical application evaluation indicated that the probe TPA&#8208;M could be efficiently employed in imaging exogenously added H2S in living MCF&#8208;7&#8197;cells and detecting H2S in actual water and wine samples.

         <title>Catalytic C&#8722;C/C&#8722;H Bond Activation Relay for Synthesis of Fluorescent Naphthoquinolizinium Salts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 18, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequential catalytic C&#8722;C/C&#8722;H bond activation relay starting from 1&#8208;azabiphenylene via intermediate benzo[h]quinolines allows short syntheses of various 5,6,10,11&#8208;tetrasubstituted naphtho[2,1,8&#8208;ija]quinolizinium salts bearing various types of substituents. The salts exhibit strong fluorescence (up to &gt;99&#8201;%) ranging from 420&#8211;600&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a series of novel cationic nitrogen&#8208;embedded polyaromatic hydrocarbons with a planar geometry. The synthetic pathway is based on catalytic C&#8722;C/C&#8722;H bond activation relay that enabled preparation of regioselectively 5,6,10,11&#8208;tetrasubstituted naphtho[2,1,8&#8208;ija]quinolizinium salts bearing various types of substituents. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analyses of selected compounds confirmed planarity of the quinolizinium core. Most of the prepared compounds exhibited strong fluorescence (&#934;s up to &gt;99&#8201;%) ranging from 420&#8211;600&#8197;nm depending on the substitution pattern. According to DFT calculations LUMO is always distributed over the quinolizinium framework regardless of the attached substituents, whereas delocalization of HOMO is related to the substitution pattern. Electrochemical measurements show irreversible reduction of all compounds, which is supported by the calculated location of LUMO orbitals.

         <title>Synthesis of Aryl&#8208; and Alkyl&#8208;Containing 3&#8208;Methylene&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxy Esters via a Barbier Allylation Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 18, May 8, 2023. </description>

This study reports the applicability of Zn and In&#8208;mediated Barbier allylation conditions in the synthesis of synthetic building blocks containing the 3&#8208;methylene&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxy core motif.







Abstract
The formation of C&#8722;C bonds via the allylation of carbonyl compounds has been widely applied in total syntheses. Amongst the many possible strategies, the Barbier&#8208;type allylation in aqueous media has received only moderate attention over the last decades despite its mild reaction conditions. In this study, we investigated the indium (In0) and zinc (Zn0) mediated Barbier allylation reaction to efficiently synthesize base&#8208;labile 3&#8208;methylene&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxy containing building blocks for natural product total synthesis. As model study we selected the allylation of lipidic undecanal with ethyl 3&#8208;(bromomethyl)but&#8208;3&#8208;enoate in the presence of either Zn0 or In0 and investigated the effects of additives on yields and selectivities. We then applied the optimized reaction conditions to sterically demanding allyl bromides and functionalized aromatic aldehydes yielding eleven new homoallylic alcohols, one of which was further transformed via oxidation and reduction sequences.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Acyl Lactonization of Alkenes with Acyl Chlorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 18, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic acyl lactonization of alkenoic acids with simple and inexpensive acyl chlorides has been developed for a modular synthesis of acyl lactones. The protocol allows an efficient construction of biologically important phthalide framework, which features excellent yields, good functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. Preliminary mechanistic investigations revealed that the transformation probably proceeded through a free radical pathway.







Abstract
A photocatalytic acyl lactonization of unsaturated carboxylic acids using simple and inexpensive acyl chlorides has been developed for a modular synthesis of acyl lactones. Significantly, the simple protocol could allow an efficient construction of biologically important phthalide framework. The transformation could be extended to a wide variety of unsaturated carboxylic acids, including substituted 2&#8208;vinyl benzoic acids and different types of alkenoic acids. Moreover, a series of aroyl, heteroaroyl chlorides could serve as coupling partners. Notably, functional groups including MeO, F, Cl and Br could survive. It is believed that acyl radicals generated from acyl chlorides under photoredox catalysis reacted with alkenes via atom&#8208;transfer radical addition (ATRA) and triggered subsequent lactonization in the process. Preliminary mechanistic investigations revealed that the transformation probably proceeded through a free radical pathway.

         <title>Decarboxylative Mannich Reactions with N&#8208;Alkyl Imines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 18, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decarboxylative Mannich reactions with substituted malonic acids half oxyesters as pronucleophiles has been applied to N&#8208;alkyl imines. Key to success was the use of an organocatalyst in combination with acid additives to favor the desired pathway. These conditions were also found to be compatible with the in&#8197;situ generation of the imine, leading to an original multicomponent reaction.







Abstract
The use of N&#8208;alkyl imines in decarboxylative Mannich reaction with substituted malonic acids half oxyesters (SMAHOs) has been developed to afford a direct access to secondary &#946;2,3&#8208;aminoesters. The transformation occurs under very practical conditions (DABCO as a catalyst in bulk toluene and open to air) and can be performed with a broad range of each substrate in yields of 36 to 97&#8201;%. Importantly, the reaction was found to require the use of acidic additives in combination with the organocatalyst to limit the competitive olefination reaction.

         <title>Thermolysis of Geminal Diazido Malonamides: Simple Access to Tetrazoles and Functionalization of In Situ Formed Isocyanates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 18, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrazole or urea compound: The thermolytical decomposition under microwave irradiation of diazidated malonamides was studied. A variety of different tetrazoles could be synthesized in three steps starting from diethyl malonate. Furthermore, the formation of isocyanates in&#8197;situ was investigated.







Abstract
In recent years, the development of synthetic methods to afford nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles has become increasingly popular. Among these, tetrazoles &#8211; an important class of aromatic heterocycles &#8211; are of significant interest for example, in medicinal chemistry serving as important bioisosteres. Herein, we present a method to easily access C&#8208;substituted tetrazoles via thermolysis of geminal diazido malonamides. Formation and functionalization of in&#8197;situ formed isocyanates and corresponding reactions were also studied.

         <title>Sydnone Methides: Intermediates between Mesoionic Compounds and Mesoionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 18, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sydnone methides can be deprotonated to form anionic NHCs which were converted into selenoethers and phosphanyl derivatives.







Abstract
Sydnone methides represent an almost unknown class of mesoionic compounds which possess exocyclic carbon substituents instead of oxygen (sydnones) or nitrogen (sydnone imines) in the 5&#8208;position of a 1,2,3&#8208;oxadiazolium ring. Unsubstituted 4&#8208;positions give rise to the generation of anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes by deprotonation. Preparations of new sydnone methides are described here. They can be represented by mesomeric structures with either exocyclic carbanionic groups like &#8722;C(CN)2&#8722;, &#8722;C(CN)(COOMe)&#8722;, &#8722;C(CN)(CONH2)&#8722;, and &#8722;C(CN)(SO2Me)&#8722;, or with the corresponding exocyclic C=C double bonds as a common feature with mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins. An X&#8208;ray single structure analysis revealed a length of 140.7(3)&#8197;pm of the exocyclic bond in the solid state. From the coalescence temperature (55&#8201;&#176;C) determined by a series of 13C&#8197;NMR experiments (150&#8197;MHz) at various temperatures, an energy of rotation of 18.5&#8197;Kcal/mol was calculated for this bond. The 13C&#8197;NMR signals of the anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, from which the 2&#8208;mesityl&#8208;substituted anionic NHC proved to be stable up to 10&#8201;&#176;C, are highly shifted upfield (&#948;carbene=157.9&#8197;ppm&#8722;160.5&#8197;ppm). The carbenes can be reacted in&#8197;situ with elemental selenium and chlorophosphanes to yield sydnone methide selenoethers after methylation and 4&#8208;phosphanylsydnone methides in good to excellent yields, respectively.

         <dc:description>
Milling the group 14. The preparation of a hypercoordinate silicon species based on Martin spirosilane bearing a perfluoroethyl chain and its use in solution and in the solid state by mechanochemistry has led to the intriguing observation of the nucleophilic behavior of this bench&#8208;stable salt. In this report, the characterization, the properties and the chemical reactivity of this species are highlighted and rationalized.







Abstract
We herein report the first synthesis of a Martin silicate bearing a pentafluoroethyl chain. The full characterisation of this new pentacoordinated silicon species is detailed. Insights on its electronic properties based on structural, physicochemical and computational data are provided. A comparative study of reactivity in solution and in solid state by mechanochemistry has been performed in order to assess the ability of this bench&#8208;stable salt to act as a safe C2F5&#8208;alkylation reagent in a nucleophilic or radical manner.

Iron&#8208;catalyzed trifluoromethylation of indole&#8208;tethered alkene with Togni's reagent to construct CF3&#8208;containing spiro[indole&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidine] and tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives under mild and convenient conditions has been disclosed.







Abstract
An iron&#8208;catalyzed trifluoromethylation of indole&#8208;tethered alkene with Togni's reagent to construct CF3&#8208;containing spiro[indole&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidine] and tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives under mild and convenient conditions has been disclosed. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction proceed through a CF3 radical addition to the alkene, followed by sequential dearomatizing spiocyclization of the indole and oxidation to afford the spiro[indole&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidine] derivatives. Meanwhile, when the substituent at the C2 position of the indole is hydrogen, the CF3&#8208;containing tetrahydrocarbazole is obtained through trifluoromethylation of alkene and cyclization of indole.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Linearly Fused Triquinanes through Tandem&#8208;Metathesis: Access to Basic Core of Cucumin, Capnellene, Chondrosterin, and Xeromphalinone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 18, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem&#8208;metathesis approach to linearly fused tricyclic enone 1 and cis&#8208;anti&#8208;cis&#8208;type hydroxy&#8208;triquinane 2 has been described in an efficient manner starting with exo&#8208;dicyclopentadiene&#8208;1&#8208;one. The tricyclic enone 1 was found to be a core unit of triquinane&#8208;based natural products such as cucumin, capnellene, chondrosterin, and xeromphalinone.







Abstract
Herein, a short synthetic approach to linearly fused tricyclic enone 1 and cis&#8208;anti&#8208;cis type hydroxy&#8208;triquinane 2 has been described in an efficient manner by employing tandem&#8208;metathesis as a key step. The triquinane&#8208;based enone 1 is prepared by a Babler&#8211;Dauben oxidation of hydroxy&#8208;triquinane 2, which is assembled by following a three&#8208;step sequence involving a regio&#8208; and stereoselective allylation, vinyl Grignard addition, and tandem&#8208;metathesis. Our strategy relies on exo&#8208;tricyclic ketone, which is derived from readily available exo&#8208;dicyclopentadiene&#8208;1&#8208;one. The newly synthesized molecules were identified and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data. It is worth mentioning that tricyclic enone 1 is present as a core unit of many naturally occurring polyquinanes, particularly xeromphalinone family members. Hence, our approach may be useful in the synthesis of such bioactive molecules.

The Front Cover illustrates the self&#8208;assembly of a cartoon parachute group conducting experiments. The picture is inspired by supramolecular self&#8208;assembly processes leading to endohedral&#8208;functionalized cages. Such cages can mediate or catalyze chemical reactions with their endohedral groups or metals/complexes directly interacting with them. Cover design by Emily C. Monkcom. More information can be found in the Review by M. Otte.

Endohedral&#8208;functionalized cage compounds play an increasing role in cage chemistry. Here, the recent developments of reactions that are mediated or catalyzed by such endohedral&#8208;functionalized cages is reviewed. The article is structured according to the role that the endohedral group plays with respect to the reaction mediated or catalyzed.







Abstract
The introduction of enhanced functionalization is a key aspect in the current design of cage chemistry. At the moment, several approaches are intensively investigated. The synthesis of cage compounds that display endohedral functionalization plays a key role among them. Here, the studies of reactions that occur in endohedral&#8208;functionalized cage compounds is reviewed. After an introduction in current trends in cage&#8208;chemistry the discussion of reactions in endohedral&#8208;cage compounds is divided into three sections. These are: 1) Endohedral groups that are by themselves functional, 2) endohedral groups that can bind to a transition&#8208;metal complex and 3) endohedral groups that can bind by themselves to a metal. The article closes with an outlook on additional current developments in the field of endohedral&#8208;functionalized cage&#8208;compounds, which may contribute in the future towards reactivity in cage compounds.

This Review provides an overview of various synthetic methodologies and the application of peptides in drug discovery.







Abstract
Peptides are described as naturally occurring short chains of amino acids and offer great potential as therapeutic agents because of their target selectivity, safe, and well tolerable. Hence, there is an increased interest in peptides in pharmaceutical research and development and approximately more than 170 peptide therapeutics are currently being evaluated in clinical trials and many are being used as therapeutic drugs for various diseases including COVID&#8208;19. The present Review article focuses on recent progress in peptide drug discovery and advancements in synthetic methodologies to enhance their stability and physiological activity of peptides and as well peptidomimetics.

Electron&#8208;rich hydrazone&#8208;based molecules centred on thiophene or pyrrole &#960;&#8208;bridges have been investigated in their optical and electrochemical properties as potential hole transport material for use in perovskite solar cells. A brief cost analysis has also been carried out to evaluate the sustainability of their synthetic process.







Abstract
A series of organic electron&#8208;rich &#960;&#8208;bridged symmetric hydrazones, composed of two donor moieties connected through a thiophene&#8208; or a pyrrole&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;spacer, has been synthesized as a suitable alternative to 2,2&#8217;,7,7&#8217;&#8208;tetrakis[N,N&#8208;di(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino]&#8208;9,9&#8217;&#8208;spirobifluorene (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD), considered the benchmark hole transporting material (HTM) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The cheap synthetic protocol is suitable for potential large&#8208;scale production. All the compounds were characterized, showing good energy levels alignments with the perovskite and very close energy levels to the Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. Furthermore, computational analysis confirmed the electrochemical trend observed. The costs of synthesis were estimated, as well as the produced waste to synthesise the final HTMs, underlining the low impact of these compounds on the environment with the respect to Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. Overall, the relevant electrochemical properties and the low cost of the synthetic approaches allow these compounds to be a greener and easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize alternative to the Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD for industrial development of PSCs.

         <title>Stereoselective Mannich Reactions in the Synthesis of Enantiopure Piperidine Alkaloids and Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Piperidine alkaloids are members of the alkaloid family that is characterized by the presence of a six&#8208;membered nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycle. Piperidine alkaloids are found mainly in plants and often exhibit interesting biological and pharmacological activities. Despite the accumulation of these natural products in plants, relatively low quantities of alkaloids are produced in absolute terms and thus synthesis of alkaloids and derivatives thereof remains relevant to identify targets for drug discovery. Throughout the years, researchers have come up with a myriad of methods to synthesize piperidine derivatives. This review describes methods that employ stereoselective Mannich reactions to create the core of piperidine alkaloids. Asymmetric induction in the Mannich reaction has been achieved by a range of methods that have been divided into three conceptual approaches: (1) chiral pool&#8208;based (internal asymmetric induction), (2) chiral auxiliary&#8208;based (relayed asymmetric induction) and (3) asymmetric catalysis&#8208;based (external asymmetric induction). Of each approach, we describe the reaction mechanism and rationalize the stereochemical outcome of the Mannich products.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Suzuki Coupling Strategy toward New Nile Red Derivatives with Improved Two&#8208;Photon Brightness</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 14 Nile Red analogues with (hetero)aryl substituents at the 2&#8208; or 3&#8208;positions were synthesized from convenient Suzuki couplings. Two&#8208;photon excitation efficiency and general fluorescent properties were evaluated. A 4&#8208;aminophenyl group resulted in extreme solvent sensitivity, and a thien&#8208;2&#8208;yl group led to significantly redshifted emission, large Stokes shift and high two&#8208;photon brightness.







Abstract
Chemical fine&#8208;tuning of fluorophores is a pivotal step towards development of next generation fluorescent dyes for microscopy. With the advent of high&#8208;resolution two&#8208;photon excitation fluorescence imaging, there is a growing demand for very sensitive laser dyes that can be efficiently excited using commercial Ti:sapphire laser sources in the first near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;I, 780&#8211;1020&#8197;nm). Using the fluorescent dye Nile Red as the lead structure, we report a robust and concise Suzuki coupling approach for the synthesis of 14 new Nile Red analogues that feature extended &#960; ring systems and diverse functionalities. For this set, we gauged their two&#8208;photon excitation efficiency in NIR&#8208;I as well as evaluated their general fluorescent properties (emission wavelength, Stokes shift, quantum yield and solvatochromism). Several of the new fluorophores were found to display very favorable characteristics. In particular, the derivative featuring a 4&#8208;aminophenyl group in the 2&#8208;position of Nile Red exhibited extreme solvent sensitivity, and the thien&#8208;2&#8208;yl substituted Nile Red derivative showed significantly redshifted emission, large Stokes shift and high two&#8208;photon brightness.

         <title>Photoinduced Glycosylation Using a Diarylthiophene as an Organo Lewis Photoacid Catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoinuduced glycosylations of trichloroacetimidate donors and several alcohols using diarylthiophenes as organo Lewis photoacid catalysts proceeded smoothly to give the corresponding glycosides in good to high yields. In addition, the present glycosylation method was applied successfully to the total synthesis of a biologically active natural product, cholesteryl 6&#8208;O&#8208;myristoyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;glucoside.







Abstract
Here reports an photoinduced glycosylation of trichloroacetimidate donors and several alcohols using 3,11&#8208;dimethoxydinaphthothiophene as an organo Lewis photoacid catalyst upon long&#8208;wavelength UV&#8208;LED light (385&#8197;nm) irradiation. The reaction proceeded under mild reaction conditions smoothly to give the corresponding glycosides in good to high yields. In addition, the present glycosylation method was applicable to a wide range of trichloroacetimidate donors and acceptors. Furthermore, the dinaphthothiophene catalyst could be recovered and reused without any loss of efficiency. Moreover, this glycosylation method was applied successfully to the total synthesis of a biologically active natural product, cholesteryl 6&#8208;O&#8208;myristoyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;glucoside.

         <title>Lithiation and Alkylation of the Imidazole Backbone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the alkylation of the imidazole backbone has been developed. Imidazole was protected with tetrahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran&#8208;2&#8208;yl and chloro groups, respectively. The backbone (position 5) of imidazole was then lithiated and alkylated with haloalkanes, aldehydes, and ketones. The protective groups were removed by treatment with acid and base and hydrogenation. The method proved good functional group tolerance.







Abstract
A concise improved method for the alkylation of the imidazole backbone has been developed. The positions 1 and 2 of the imidazole ring were protected with tetrahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran&#8208;2&#8208;yl and chloro groups, respectively. Position 5 of imidazole was then lithiated, whereupon alkylation could be conducted by means of a variety of electrophilic reagents including haloalkanes, aldehydes, and ketones. Finally, the two protective / auxiliary groups on the positions 1 and 2 were easily removed by means of treatment with acid and base and hydrogenation, respectively. The developed method proved good functional group tolerance but demanded non&#8208;bulky molecular moieties in the vicinity of the attaching C&#8208;atom of the reagent. The novel alkylating method was used to synthesize two new NHC&#8722;Ag complexes holding branched alkyl groups on the imidazole backbone.

         <title>Exploitation of Dimeric Cyclic Cysteine as Helix Inducer in Ultra&#8208;Short Peptides for Cu(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Michael Addition on Chalcones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic cysteine analogues were efficiently used as constrained unnatural amino acids proving able to induce stable conformation in Leu&#8208;Val containing peptides. These ultra&#8208;short peptides were then used as chiral ligands in copper(II) complexes and applied to the asymmetric Michael addition on differently substituted chalcones.







Abstract
A dimeric cyclic cysteine analogue, i.e. (1R,1&#8242;R,2R,2&#8242;R)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;disulfanediylbis (aminocyclohexane&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acid), was used as a constrained unnatural amino acid and as a folding inducer in ultra&#8208;short Leu&#8208;Val&#8208;containing peptide. Our results showed that both free dimer amino acid L1 and its peptide derivative L2 are able to chelate Cu(II). The obtained complexes resulted to be catalytically active in Michael addition reaction of nitromethane on different types of chalcones. L1&#8208;Cu(II) was shown more reactive in terms of conversion, while, in neat conditions, L2&#8208;Cu(II) allows to obtain an interesting 60&#8201;%&#8197;e.e. on pyridine chalcone.

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocyclic and Fused Isoxazoline Building Blocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly efficient multigram synthesis of spirocyclic and fused isoxazoline building blocks is described. Isoxazoline&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates were synthesized via a regioselective 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction of 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;(hydroxyimino)acetate and carbo&#8208; or heterocyclic alkenes bearing endo&#8208; or exocyclic C=C double bonds, resulting in fused or spirocyclic isoxazolines, respectively. The preparation of up to 300 g of these compounds was achieved in a single run. The ester group of isoxazolines was then subjected to common synthetic transformations for the synthesis of corresponding building blocks, including alcohols, chlorides, azides, amines, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, amino acids and their derivatives, difluoromethyl&#8208;substituted compounds, and bicyclic &#947;&#8208;lactones. Additionally, a direct cycloaddition&#8208;based approach to the synthesis of aminoalkyl&#8208; and chloromethyl&#8208;substituted isoxazolines was proposed to improve their preparation. The described isoxazoline building blocks are expected to be valuable tools for drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>: 2&#8208;Cyanobenzaldehye (also called 2&#8208;formylbenzonitrile) and related 2&#8208;acylbenzonitriles belong to a class of bifunctional aromatic compounds that emerged as useful starting materials in developing efficient cascade&#8208;type reactions leading to different heterocyclic compounds. The variety of sometimes unpredictable mechanisms that rise from these structurally simple starting materials renders this class of compounds unique to afford, through divergent cascade reactions, heterocycles like isoindolinones, phthalides (also known with the name of isobenzofuranones), imidates, and in less extent isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;imine, six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered heterocycles, porphyrins, also in asymmetric way exploiting different organocatalytic activation modes. To give a picture, this chemistry can be associated to Goldberg variations which stem from a common motive in a pressing and surprising way. Emphasis is also given to the synthetic methods for the access to substituted 2&#8208;cyanobenzaldehydes and 2&#8208;acylbenzonitriles which allowed to enlarge the scope of the described cascade reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemistry and Applications of Functionalized 2,4&#8208;Thiazolidinediones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive look at the synthesis and chemistry of TZD derivatives, with their general modes of reactivity describing in detail the pros and cons of each strategy, as a guide for the design and the proper election of the synthetic route for novel functional TZD reagents. Also, the routes are reinforced with illustrations of the use of TZD chemistry into biological candidates that have emerged in more in recent years.







Abstract
Thiazolidinedione (TZD) is one of the privileged heterocyclic rings and has shown many biological applications in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. This review covers the synthetic approaches of TZD and its derivatives, different synthetic techniques for affording the desired regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, and the techniques that would enhance reaction conditions such as microwave, one&#8208;pot, or ultrasound synthesis.

&lt;p&gt;This review provides a comprehensive look at the synthesis and chemistry of TZD derivatives, with their general modes of reactivity describing in detail the pros and cons of each strategy, as a guide for the design and the proper election of the synthetic route for novel functional TZD reagents. Also, the routes are reinforced with illustrations of the use of TZD chemistry into biological candidates that have emerged in more in recent years.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thiazolidinedione (TZD) is one of the privileged heterocyclic rings and has shown many biological applications in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. This review covers the synthetic approaches of TZD and its derivatives, different synthetic techniques for affording the desired regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, and the techniques that would enhance reaction conditions such as microwave, one-pot, or ultrasound synthesis. It focuses on synthetic challenges of glitazones and the transformation of other heterocycles to TZD. Moreover, the chemical and biological behavior of TZD through the substitution in the N3 position, modification of the C5 position, annealing in complex heterocyclic systems, and hybridization with other pharmacologically attractive moieties are discussed. All reactions mentioned are provided as possible with different reaction conditions, mechanisms, derivatives scope, yield and clarified by applications of such reactions in the construction of potential medicinal agents. The review also answers questions about rapid racemization of glitazones, their toxicity, considering TZD as pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS) or not, and the influence of saturation of 5-position of TZD in their biological activities. This review is a comprehensive guide to make informed decisions for construction of TZD derivatives with biological potentials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Concise Synthesis, Conformational Study, and Aroma Properties of Carba&#8208;Homologues of Helvetolide and Serenolide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The insertion of a methylene unit into the structure of powerful musky odorants completely shifts the odour of their homologues to intense and persistent sweet aroma with floral and herbal aspects.







Abstract
We have designed, prepared, and evaluated a set of racemic (un)saturated carba&#8208;homologues of prominent musks Helvetolide and Serenolide. The short synthesis employs commercially available Artemone and/or Herbac, that are transformed in three steps to the target compounds. Their qualitative olfactory analysis revealed that incorporation of methylene bridge into the backbone chain of parent compounds completely erases the original musk scent and such new derivatives exhibit a pleasant and often intense sweet(ish) aroma of fruit with floral and herbal aspects. The results of computational modelling suggest that previously postulated horseshoe shape conformation might be necessary but not sufficient prerequisite for musk&#8208;scented compounds. Thus, we offer an alternative hypothesis based on the structural differences between metallocomplexes of Helvetolide and/or Serenolide vs. their (un)saturated carba&#8208;homologues with zinc&#8208;atom as a model for the putative metal&#8208;binding site in human olfactory receptors.

         <title>A Mechanistic Perspective on the Mechanochemical Method To Reduce Carbonyl Groups with Stainless Steel and Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical reduction of the carbonyl group has been investigated using temperature&#8208;controlled mixer mill. The design of solvent&#8208;free organic transformation has resulted in increased interest in mechanochemistry, the water&#8208;mediated mechanochemical reduction was conducted in a stainless&#8208;steel vial. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reduction proceeds through a single electron transfer pathway, with iron and nickel as essential components for the reaction.







Abstract
Mechanochemistry through high&#8208;speed ball milling has become an increasingly popular method for performing organic transformations. This newfound interest in high&#8208;speed ball milling is in part driven by the benefit of performing reactions in the absence of solvent. Mechanochemical reactions are often conducted in stainless&#8208;steel vials with stainless&#8208;steel balls. Since stainless steel is made of several readily oxidizable metals (Fe, Cr, and Ni), reduction reactions using water as a hydrogen source were explored using a temperature&#8208;controlled mixer mill. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reduction proceeds via a single electron transfer (SET) pathway, with iron and nickel being essential components for the reaction.

         <title>The meta and para OH Substitution Effect on C&#8208;Phenyl&#8208;Nitrilimine Bond&#8208;Shift Isomers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The geometric and electronic structure of 1,3&#8208;dipolar species, in particular of nitrile imines, can be surprisingly intricate. A particular example is the C&#8208;phenyl&#8208;nitrilimine, which exists as two energy minima that constitute bond&#8208;shift isomers. Questioning whether substituents in the phenyl ring could affect the existence of such bond&#8208;shift isomers, here we investigate the meta and para OH substituted derivatives. These two nitrile imines were generated in an argon matrix at 15 K by UV&#8208;irradiation of 2H&#8208;tetrazole precursors and found to photoisomerize to carbodiimides via 1H&#8208;diazirines. Using IR spectroscopy and quantum mechanical calculations, the C&#8208;(3&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)&#8208;nitrilimine was established to exist as two bond&#8208;shift isomers, with predominant propargylic and allenic type structures, whereas the C&#8208;(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)&#8208;nitrilimine was established to exist only as one species with a significant allenic type structure. The different effects of the OH substitution in meta and para positions on the bond&#8208;shift isomerism are rationalized with the support of Natural Resonance Theory and Hirshfeld atomic charges. Such fundamental knowledge, on the understanding of how substitution affects the structural characteristics of C&#8208;phenyl&#8208;nitrilimines, opens the door to modulate the chemistry of this important class of reactive compounds (e.g. in cycloaddition reactions) by appropriate tuning of their substitution (substituent type and position).</dc:description>

         <title>Yb(OTf)3 Anchored on Crosslinked Chitosan Microsphere: A Green Heterogenized Catalyst for the Synthesis of Bispiro&#8208;Fused Heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Yb(OTf)3 anchored on crosslinked chitosan microsphere (Yb(OTf)3@CCM) was prepared by facile processes. Using Yb(OTf)3@CCM as a green heterogeneous catalyst, the three&#8208;component [3+2] cycloaddition of isatins, tetrahydroisoquinolines and 5&#8208;alkenyl rhodanines was developed, which gave access to a suite of architecturally complex bispiro&#8208;fused heterocycles merging four pharmacophores.







Abstract
Using renewable biomass chitosan as a raw material, crosslinked chitosan microsphere (CCM) was prepared by inverse suspension, which was then immersed in the ethanol solution of Yb(OTf)3 to fabricate CCM&#8208;supported Yb(OTf)3 (Yb(OTf)3@CCM). The three&#8208;component [3+2] cycloaddition of isatins, tetrahydroisoquinolines and 5&#8208;alkenyl rhodanines was developed with Yb(OTf)3@CCM as a green heterogeneous catalyst, which gave access to a suite of architecturally complex bispiro&#8208;fused heterocycles merging four pharmacophores with moderate to excellent yields (50&#8211;96&#8201;%) and diastereoselectivities (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). The reaction mechanism was preliminarily clarified by controlled experiments and dynamic high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry studies. The synthetic potential of this protocol was proved by a gram&#8208;scale reaction which furnished the product with comparable results (85&#8201;% yield and 72&#8201;:&#8201;28 dr). Moreover, the catalyst could be recovered just through filtering, washing and drying process, and reused five times with the catalytic activity remaining in an acceptable range (from 93&#8201;% to 73&#8201;% yield).

         <dc:description>A direct and regioselective lithiation was realized on N&#8208;Boc pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;f][1,2,4]triazine, simply utilizing the distinct sigma&#8208;acidity on C&#8208;9. Starting from this enabling discovery, C&#8208;glycoside formation, cyanation, and global deprotection steps constitute one of the most efficient syntheses of GS&#8208;441524. Furthermore, transient protection was applied on GS&#8208;441524 with phenyl boronic acid, and facilitated a powerful one&#8208;pot synthesis of remdesivir.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Multicomponent Synthesis of Oxazolidinones from Primary Amines and Cesium (Hydrogen)Carbonate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A facile multicomponent, catalyst&#8208;free oxazolidinone synthesis from primary aliphatic or aromatic amines, dibromoethane (DBE), and the usage of either cesium carbonate or cesium hydrogencarbonate as the simultaneous base and C1 source is reported. The applicability of this technically simple reaction was demonstrated by a broad scope with generally high yields, enabling concise late&#8208;stage functionalization of amino groups into N&#8208;substituted oxazolidinones. The proposed operating reaction mechanism consists of a first&#8208;step nucleophilic substitution reaction between DBE and the primary amine, followed by the formation of a carbamate or carbonate intermediate and subsequent cyclization. Additional versatility of the herein&#8208;developed protocol has been showcased in a medicinal chemistry approach by the generation of an oxazolidinone&#8208;modified dipeptidyl peptidase 8 (DPP8) inhibitor.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Arylselanyl Benzothiophenes through Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Radical Cyclization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, the synthesis of 3&#8208;(arylselanyl)benzothiophenes has gained significant attention from the synthetic community due to their promising biological features as drug candidates. While notable syntheses of these compounds have been reported, they have certain limitations, such as the need for sensitive/harsh reaction conditions, toxic/sensitive catalysts or reagents. We developed a novel method for synthesizing 3&#8208;arylselanyl benzothiophenes through visible light&#8208;mediated radical cyclization. Diaryl selenides were used as aryl selenium sources under the irradiation of white LEDs (5 W). The reactions were conducted under mild conditions, where the desired products were obtained at room temperature without the need for catalysts or additives.&#160;Our method facilitates the rapid access to various benzothiophene derivatives, which are important scaffolds in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
An I2&#8208;mediated oxidative amidation leads to a wide variety of primary &#945;&#8208;ketoamides from aryl methyl ketones with ammonium carbamodithioate is described. Control experiments indicated an iodination/nucleophilic substitution/Kornblum oxidation/amidation mechanism.







Abstract
Here we report the preparation of primary &#945;&#8208;ketoamides via a highly efficient molecular iodine&#8208;mediated oxidative amidation of aryl methyl ketones with ammonium carbamodithioate. A self&#8208;sequenced iodination/nucleophilic substitution/Kornblum oxidation/amidation mechanism was proposed. In this mechanism, &#945;&#8208;thiocyanatoacetophenone is the key intermediate.

         <title>A Light&#8208;Induced Decarboxylative&#8208;Elimination of Substituted Maleimides as a Strategy Towards Triggered Photorelease</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photodecarboxylation&#8208;elimination reaction of various substituted maleimides is described, with convenient wavelength tunability through modulation of the maleimide substituents. These versatile reagents, which are readily constructed and diversified by nucleophilic substitution reactions on bromomaleimides, offer enticing new opportunities for triggered photorelease.







Abstract
Herein we report on photodecarboxylations of various substituted maleimides, resulting in an elimination reaction. Furthermore, we establish facile wavelength tunability through modulation of the maleimide double bond substituents. We envisage that these versatile reagents, which are readily constructed and diversified by nucleophilic substitution reactions on bromomaleimides, will offer new opportunities for triggered photorelease.

         <title>Thioether&#8208;Substituted Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of novel mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and hexafluorinated hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs) and their conversion into their thioether&#8208;substituted analogs is reported. The substitution reaction with the corresponding thiolates was performed microwave&#8208;assisted to significantly reduce the reaction time. With increasing amount of fluorination or thioether&#8208;substituents, a decreasing extinction coefficient can be observed for the HBCs. Successive addition of thioether&#8208;moieties leads to a bathochromic shift of the absorption and emission bands, whereas the nature of the attached thioether does not affect the optoelectronical properties. To further tune the electronic environment of the HBC core, a successive oxidation to the corresponding sulfone as well as the formation of the sulfonium salts were performed. With that, the electron&#8208;donating thioethers were transformed into electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents, resulting in an inversed electron demand in the periphery of the core. The so obtained compounds showed decreased extinction coefficients and a broadening of the absorption and emission bands.</dc:description>

         <title>Dihydroazulene &#8211; Boron Subphthalocyanine Conjugates with Oligo(phenyleneethynylene) Bridging Unit: Photoswitchable Fluorophores</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we have linked the dihydroazulene (DHA) / vinylheptafulvene (VHF) photo&#8208;/thermoswitch and the boron subphthalocyanine (BsubPc) fluorophore via an axial oligo(phenyleneethynylene) bridging unit into new DHA&#8208;BsubPc conjugates. The objectives were to elucidate the influence of BsubPc on the DHA/VHF switching reactions and the influence of DHA/VHF on the BsubPc fluorescence in these conjugates for which the entire axial substituent connected to the boron comprises one large conjugated scaffold. We present the synthesis and properties of DHA&#8208;BsubPc conjugates with varying peripheral substituents on the BsubPc core, being either unsubstituted (H12BsubPc) or partially fluorinated (F6BsubPc). Fluorination of the BsubPc core provided a remarkable increase in the reversibility of the DHA&#8208;VHF interconversions promoted by light and heat, respectively, and accompanied by on/off switching of the BsubPc fluorescence. Synthetically, the units were connected using Sonogashira coupling reactions of suitable acetylenic building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Methylene Tetrahydrofurane&#8208;Fused Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A reliable method is disclosed to introduce a fused methylene tetrahydrofuran ring into carbohydrates. The resulting bicyclic saccharides can be used as scaffolds in medicinal chemistry and drug design. In addition, the enol ether functionality serves as a handle that enables modification in biological systems via photoclick chemistry. The approach is based on the regioselective oxidation of the C&#8208;3 hydroxy group in gluco&#8208;configured pyranosides, followed by stereoselective indium&#8208;mediated allylation. The ring formation is induced by an iodocyclization reaction with a neighboring hydroxy group. Subsequent dehydrohalogenation affords the desired methylene&#8208;tetrahydrofuran&#8208;containing carbohydrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of Hypervalent Iodine(III) Reagents Bearing Transferable N&#8208;Based Groups</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypervalent iodine reagents have the ability of inverting the polarity of functional groups bound to iodine, a reactivity known as umpolung. This reactivity makes hypervalent iodine compounds highly attractive for the creation of electrophilic synthons of known nucleophiles. This strategy results in novel synthetic disconnections and the creation of new Nu(nucleophile)&#8208;N bond.
Electrophilic sources of nitrogen&#8208;based groups have been known for many decades and are of great synthetic importance. Traditionally, these reagents are limited to few examples. With the use of hypervalent iodine, the transfer of a wide diversity of nitrogen sources became a possibility. This review compiles the latest reported examples of hypervalent iodine reagents capable of electrophilic transfer of nitrogen&#8208;based groups.

This reactivity makes hypervalent iodine compounds highly attractive for the creation of electrophilic synthons of known nucleophiles. This strategy results in novel synthetic disconnections and the creation of new Nu(nucleophile)-N bond.
Electrophilic sources of nitrogen-based groups have been known for many decades and are of great synthetic importance. Traditionally, these reagents are limited to few examples. With the use of hypervalent iodine, the transfer of a wide diversity of nitrogen sources became a possibility. This review compiles the latest reported examples of hypervalent iodine reagents capable of electrophilic transfer of nitrogen-based groups. It showcases the preparation of such reagents, their synthetic utility and reaction mechanisms involving these group transfer reagents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multicomponent Reactions Based on SO2 Surrogates: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The&#160;incorporation of&#160;sulfonyl&#8208;derived functional groups has received intensive attention owing to its widespread application in biologically active compounds, pharmaceuticals and materials. In the past decade, the multi&#8208;component sulfonylation reactions achieved through sulfur dioxide (SO2) insertion strategy have emerged as a novel and attractive approach to access sulfonyl&#8208;containing compounds. The utilization of SO2 surrogate for SO2 insertion in the multicomponent reactions&#160;exhibits improved flexibility and step economy. Moreover, some advances have been achieved in the challenging but practical asymmetric multicomponent reactions&#160;for construction of high value&#8208;added chiral sulfones. This review aims to summarize the progress made in the multicomponent reactions based on SO2 surrogates in the recent three years. Finally, the potential and challenges&#160;in this field for&#160;synthesis of sulfonyl&#8208;containing molecules are pointed out.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Rhodomyrtone Analogs Modified at C7</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We developed a route to rhodomyrtone analogs that feature different acyl groups at C7. Since electrophilic substitution reactions on the aryl part of the rhodomyrtone core led to C5 derivatives, the C5 position was blocked by a chlorine. Subsequent Duff type formylation followed by Grignard addition to the aldehyde group and oxidation gave various phenones. The benzyl protecting groups were removed by hydrogenation or boron tribromide. Some derivatives turned out to be quite active against multiple resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains and a rhodomyrtone resistant mutant (RomR). The chlorine at C5 seems to have a beneficial effect on the antibacterial activity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A regioselective bromination or chlorination reaction of 1&#8208;naphthaldehydes is described. Without additive, the palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H halogenation showed a C8&#8208;regioselectivity, whereas the formation of an aromatic imine intermediate allowed a switch to a C2&#8208;reactivity. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations were performed to explain the regioselectivity and the synthesized halogenated products were used as key building blocks to access polycyclic natural product skeletons.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkyl Bridged Nitropyrazoles &#8208; Adjustment of Performance and Sensitivity Parameter</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Starting from 3,5&#8208;dinitro&#8208;4&#8208;methylaminopyrazole (2), six different energetic salts and three new derivatives of methylene bridged nitropyrazoles were synthesized. The derivatives bear a methylamino (4), methylnitramino (5), and azido group (7). All compounds were intensively characterized using single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and DTA/TGA measurements. The sensitivities were determined according to BAM standard methods and the energetic properties calculated using the EXPLO5 code. The energetic salts were compared with each other and with ANTA in terms of their energetic properties. On the basis of the methyl&#8208; and ethyl bridged derivatives, it was shown how the introduction of methylamino (4) and methylnitramino (5) groups in an alkyl&#8208;bridged nitropyrazole system modify its properties (performance &amp; sensitivities). In addition, azido compound 7 was contrasted with its literature known constitutional isomer and investigated for its suitability as a potential metal&#8208;free primary explosive.</dc:description>

         <title>New Trends in Asymmetric Phase Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric phase transfer catalysis constitutes an ever increasingly useful tool to construct chiral skeletons under mild and practical conditions. This Review describes new concise pathways for the synthesis of chiral motifs made possible by the design of new chiral PTC catalysts such as chiral onium salts, chiral phosphate anions and chiral bis&#8208;urea hydrogen bond donors.







Abstract
70 removed from dedication as F. Cozzi turns 72&#8197;years this year, the article is however included in the collection webpage, and the related footnote has been added. Phase Transfer Catalysis (PTC) is a powerful tool to perform reactions in a practical fashion, both in laboratory and industrial scale. Significant cost savings and major process improvements can be achieved in reactions performed under PTC conditions. In the last few years remarkable results in stereoselective reactions were achieved using chiral, non&#8208;racemic quaternary ammonium salts. Moreover, the use of bulky, chiral phosphate anions paired with achiral cations to generate lipophilic ion pairs allowed to design new avenues for the stereoselective construction of important building blocks. Hydrogen bond interactions were also shown to provide new pathways for asymmetric nucleophilic substitutions using insoluble reagents under PTC conditions. This Review will focus on recent advances in developing practical synthetic routes to construct molecules in a stereoselective fashion under PTC conditions.

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Synthesis of Chain&#8208;Deuterated Sphingosine and Its Derivatization to Produce Ceramide, Sphinganine and Sphingosine&#8208;1&#8208;Phosphate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sphingosine plays crucial roles in various cellular functions. Deuterated molecules are widely used as the important tools to explore the structure, property, and function of biochemical materials. We here report a gram&#8208;scale synthesis of sphingosines with different deuterated chains. The synthesis started from different protiated fatty acids, which underwent hydrothermal platinum&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange to produce the deuterated chains with different length. The Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons (HWE) coupling of a chiral amino acid derivative with the deuterated chains generated the unsaturated ketone precursors. The following stereoselective reduction via cyclic Felkin&#8208;Anh transition led to the desired anti&#8208;amino alcohol geometry. This efficient protocol enabled the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of the chain&#8208;deuterated sphingosines. The subsequent synthesis of the chain&#8208;deuterated derivatives, i.e. ceramide, sphinganine and sphingosine&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate, is also described. Their deuterium content was simultaneously characterised by 1H NMR and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrum (HRMS).</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Chemical Space of Non&#8208;Proteinogenic N4&#8208;Substituted Asparagine: Racemic, Enantioenriched, and Deuterated Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A site&#8208;selective carbamoylation strategy to access non&#8208;proteinogenic N4&#8208;modified asparagines has been described. The protocol is characterized by mild reaction conditions, high functional group compatibility, and a wide diversity of functionalized carbamoyl radicals. The protocol was further extended to access peptide&#8208;, pharmaceutical&#8208;, and natural products N4&#8208;asparagine conjugates as well as enantioenriched unnatural N4&#8208;asparagines. Besides that, deuterated analogues were achieved with the insertion of D2O and enantioenriched derivatives could be obtained in 15 minutes in continuous&#8208;flow conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Polystyrene&#8208;Supported Aminocatalyst Derived from Diarylprolinol for Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;Amination of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of polystyrene&#8208;supported aminocatalysts with a triazole linker from diphenyl prolinol were developed. Their catalytic activity, substrate scope, and reusability were demonstrated in asymmetric &#945;&#8208;amination of aldehydes.







Abstract
A new class of polystyrene&#8208;supported aminocatalysts with a triazole linker from diphenyl prolinol were developed. Their catalytic activity was tested in the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;amination of aldehydes. The substrate scope of this catalysis was studied under the optimized reaction conditions. The reusability of the polystyrene&#8208;supported aminocatalyst was demonstrated up to four cycles. Based on the reaction results, a reaction mechanism was proposed for the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;amination of aldehydes.

         <title>Recent Advances on Electric Field Induced Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electric field is currently being used more directly for chemical reactions. Experiments showed that the existence of electric fields in non&#8208;redox processes may alter the catalytic activity, rate enhancement, and selection. It is anticipated that this interaction between electric fields and chemical reactions will create new avenues for producing materials with desired properties in a number of chemical disciplines, including synthetic organic chemistry, catalysis, nanotechnology, membrane technology, and enzyme catalysis. Specifically, in this review we discussed the elegant experimental investigations carried out using the scanning tunneling microscope, interfacial electric fields and designed local electric fields. The results of these studies have been remarkable, leading to new information on the function of electric fields in controlling chemical reactivity and selectivity in different reactions, offering a glimpse of the great potential of electrostatic fields. This cutting&#8208;edge scientific advancement not only presents the core concepts of the field&#8208;induced chemical transformations but also encourages the creation of new modern techniques in chemistry and other fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Free Carboxylic Acids: The Trend of Radical Decarboxylative Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exceptional versatility of carboxylic acids has been extensively exploited in organic synthesis across several decades. There has been a recent upsurge of radical decarboxylative transformations. The process can be initiated under mild conditions, and the resultant radicals have orthogonal reactivities to closed&#8208;shell species, thus providing immense opportunities for streamlining novel reactions. The use of free carboxylic acids is the most desirable owing to its high atom and step economy. Aiming to demonstrate the attractiveness of the strategy and to inspire chemists to tackle existing challenges, this review outlines the recent advances on radical decarboxylative functionalization of free carboxylic acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbofluorination of &#960;&#8208;Bonds and Related Reactions Involving Tandem C&#8211;C/C&#8211;F Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the unique properties of C&#8211;F bonds, organofluorine compounds occupy a privileged space in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and polymer industries.

         <title>Tetrathiaporphyrine: A Novel Natural Product from Allium Subgenus Melanocrommyum</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel structure of a red pigment from Allium species, subgenus Melanocrommyum, has been successfully elucidated using X&#8208;ray crystallography. This revealed the compound to be a tetrathiaporphyrine, which has been synthesized in two steps starting from pyrrole.







Abstract
A novel purple&#8208;red pigment from the plant genus of Allium (onions, leeks), subgenus Melanocrommyum (drumstick onions), is described. Because of this pigment, which reminds of blood, some species of the subgenus Melanocrommyum are used in Southwest and Central Asia as herbal medications, as spices or as vegetables. A proposal for the formation of this structure is provided, which is the first example of a tetrathiaporphyrin in nature. The described substance shows low stability towards thermal stress, light and oxidant; additionally, its symmetric nature made structural elucidation a challenge. It could be shown that, contrary to previous reports, the structure of the red pigment is that of a tetrathiaporphyrin. Full structure elucidation was only possible by X&#8208;ray crystallography and total synthesis of the intended molecule. Further on, the newly discovered red pigment was used for the modification of nanoparticles and monitoring its polymerization events using SPR.

         <title>Axial Chirality in Alkylidene&#8208;Cyclic Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axial chirality is an interesting stereoisomeric phenomenon in organic chemistry and a key structural feature of several organic compounds. Atropisomer such as biaryls, anilides and diaryl ethers is one type of axially chiral compound, whose axial chirality is resulted from rotationally blocked C&#8211;X (C, N, O) single bond. Allenes, spiranes and alkylidenecycloalkanes are another type of axially chiral compounds and their axial chirality come from the perpendicular geometry of two pairs of substituents. The axial chirality in atropisomers, allenes and spiranes have been widely investigated and well developed, while the similar chirality in alkylidene&#8208;cyclic molecules gained very limited attentions. This concept focuses on summarizing recent advances of axial chirality in alkylidene&#8208;cyclic molecules and arouses the research interests to this promising field.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Domino Semipinacol&#8208;Schmidt Reaction: Diastereoselective Synthesis of 7&#8201;a&#8208;epi&#8208;(+)&#8208;Lepadiformine C and Formal Synthesis of 7&#8201;a&#8208;epi&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;Lepadiformine A</title>

         <dc:description>
A TiCl4 Lewis acid&#8208;mediated domino semi&#8208;pinacol&#8208;Schmidt reaction&#8208;based approach has been developed for the diastereoselective synthesis of 7&#8201;a epi&#8208;lepadiformine C (+)&#8208;7 and azatricyclic core of 7&#8201;a epi&#8208;lepadiformine A (+)&#8208;8&#8201;a.







Abstract
A concise approach has been developed for the diastereoselective synthesis of the azatricyclic core of (&#8722;)&#8208;7&#8201;a&#8208;epi&#8208;lepadiformine A (8&#8201;a) and (&#8722;)&#8208;7&#8201;a&#8208;epi&#8208;lepadiformine C (8&#8201;b) using stereoselective domino semipinacol&#8208;Schmidt reaction as a key step. In presence of TiCl4, the oxaspiropentane&#8208;azide derivatives underwent stereoselective domino cyclization to furnish the corresponding angularly fused azatricyclic cores in very good yields. Moreover, azatricyclic core of (&#8722;)&#8208;7&#8201;a&#8208;epi&#8208;lepadiformine A has also been realized, in a stepwise manner, through the intramolecular Schmidt reaction of azido&#8208;spirocyclobutanone intermediate. The synthetic utility of domino semipinacol&#8208;Schmidt reaction is further shown in the diastereoselective synthesis of (+)&#8208;7&#8201;a&#8208;epi&#8208;lepadiformine C (7).

         <title>A Photochemical Protocol for the Synthesis of Weinreb and Morpholine Amides from Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical protocol for the synthesis of Weinreb amides and morpholine amides from carboxylic acids is presented. Various carboxylic acids were directly coupled to N,O&#8208;dimethylhydroxylamine and morpholine, upon irradiation with either LED 370&#8197;nm or sunlight in the presence of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine and bromotrichloromethane, providing amides in moderate to high yields.







Abstract
In recent years, the development of light&#8208;mediated methods for synthetic applications has attracted high interest, because such methods constitute alternative approaches for the production of valuable chemical products. We study herein a photochemical protocol for the synthesis of Weinreb amides and morpholine amides from carboxylic acids. Various carboxylic acids were directly coupled to N,O&#8208;dimethylhydroxylamine, upon irradiation with either LED 370&#8197;nm or sunlight in the presence of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine and bromotrichloromethane, providing Weinreb amides in moderate to high yields. Similarly, morpholine amides were obtained in satisfactory to high yields under sunlight or LED 370&#8197;nm irradiation. Thus, the versatile building blocks Weinreb amides and morpholine amides may be efficiently synthesized directly from carboxylic acids by light&#8208;mediated approaches, without the need of coupling reagents or pre&#8208;activation of carboxylic acids.

         <title>Ammonium Acetate Catalyzed Formation of 1,5&#8208;Benzodiazepines through [4+2+1] Cycloaddition Involving 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ammonium acetate in ethanol is a clean and efficient protocol for the multicomponent construction of 1,5&#8208;benzodiazepines, being an appropriately mild catalyst in the case of the acid&#8208;sensitive biobased platform 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (5&#8208;HMF). The protocol is tolerant to many functional groups in substituted diamines, alkynones or alkyl alkynoates, and furanic aldehydes.







Abstract
The use of the renewable platform molecule 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (5&#8208;HMF) in multi&#8208;component reaction with a diamine and an alkynone to generate seven&#8208;membered 1,5&#8208;benzodiazepines is described. Due to the sensitivity of 5&#8208;HMF to strong acidic and basic conditions, the investigation required an in&#8208;depth revisit of reaction parameters as compared to benchmark aldehydes. Among catalysts/solvents couples, ammonium acetate in ethanol proved to be a clean and efficient system. These optimized conditions were subsequently used to investigate the scope of the reaction providing a library of 1,5&#8208;benzodiazepines in moderate to good yields from a wide range of diversely substituted diamines and alkynones or alkyl alkynoates.

         <title>Overcoming Thermodynamically Driven Retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction through a Cascade One&#8208;Pot Process Exemplified by a Bio&#8208;Based Platform Chemical</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this contribution, we describe a new approach to apply thermodynamically unfavored reactions in synthetic chemistry and to integrate them in cascade processes. By means of a new developed procedure for multi&#8208;step one&#8208;pot syntheses, we succeeded in completely converting a thermodynamically labile Diels&#8208;Alder adduct, which strongly tends to react back, to the target product with high conversion of &gt;99% and in excellent yield by coupling with a rapid subsequent hydrogenation reaction. In detail, the process is based on the use of a rotating reaction vessel to form a thin product film of the thermodynamically labile Diels&#8208;Alder product from 2&#8208;methylfuran and maleic acid anhydride (as two bio&#8208;based raw materials), which then slowly dissolves into solution and is immediately converted by hydrogenation to the target product. Such a combination of Diels&#8208;Alder reaction and hydrogenation in a sequential one&#8208;pot process without by&#8208;product formation enables the efficient production of the product, which represents a valuable bio&#8208;based platform chemical. In addition, this process concept generally opens a perspective for the integration of thermodynamically unfavorable reaction steps in multi&#8208;step one&#8208;pot cascade processes while obtaining the desired target products in high yields.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this contribution, we describe a new approach to apply thermodynamically unfavored reactions in synthetic chemistry and to integrate them in cascade processes. By means of a new developed procedure for multi-step one-pot syntheses, we succeeded in completely converting a thermodynamically labile Diels-Alder adduct, which strongly tends to react back, to the target product with high conversion of &amp;gt;99% and in excellent yield by coupling with a rapid subsequent hydrogenation reaction. In detail, the process is based on the use of a rotating reaction vessel to form a thin product film of the thermodynamically labile Diels-Alder product from 2-methylfuran and maleic acid anhydride (as two bio-based raw materials), which then slowly dissolves into solution and is immediately converted by hydrogenation to the target product. Such a combination of Diels-Alder reaction and hydrogenation in a sequential one-pot process without by-product formation enables the efficient production of the product, which represents a valuable bio-based platform chemical. In addition, this process concept generally opens a perspective for the integration of thermodynamically unfavorable reaction steps in multi-step one-pot cascade processes while obtaining the desired target products in high yields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
