         <title>Selenoureido Calix[6]arenes: A Novel Platform for Pseudorotaxane Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroditopic calix[6]arenes are widely employed macrocycles for the synthesis of pseudo&#8208;oriented interlocked systems and stimuli&#8208;induced molecular machines, among others. Herein, we introduce a new calix[6]arene receptor functionalised with three phenylselenoureido groups. These hydrogen&#8208;bonding donor moieties are able to promote the threading of viologen&#8208;based organic axles inside the macrocyclic cavity to form a stable pseudorotaxane species. Preliminary investigations using 1H&#8208;NMR measurements and semi&#8208;empirical and DFT studies suggested its further use as a platform for the synthesis of rotaxanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Ferrocenyl&#8208;azole Derivatives: Synthesis, DFT Calculation and Unlocking the Anticancer Potential</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Series of novel azoles comprising ferrocenyl, phenyl and thiophenyl derivatives were unveiled via amination of sp2 hybrid vinyllic chlorides in the catalytic presence of iron cluster. Various ferrocenated azoles were evaluated against prostate cancer cells and demonstrated a significant potency at low concentration. HOMO&#8208;LUMO levels and energy gap was calculated by DFT.







Abstract
Herein, a series of novel ferrocenyl/phenyl/thiophenyl&#8208;azoles was disclosed by vinylic amination of ferrocenyl/phenyl/thiophenyl substituted &#946;&#8208;chloro cinnamaldehydes and acrylonitriles. A highly economical and robust chalcogen&#8208;stabilized iron selenide carbonyl cluster Fe3Se2(CO)9 worked as an efficient catalyst under aerobic conditions. The amination of ferrocenyl/phenyl/thiophenyl substituted &#946;&#8208;chloro&#8208;vinylic Csp2&#8208;Cl with azole derivatives was fully established and fabrication of the Csp2&#8208;N bond was completely supported by various spectral analysis. Moreover, wide range of substrates with functionally different azoles were investigated for the present reaction and good to excellent transformation was recorded. Some of the selected ferrocenated azole derivatives were screened for anti&#8208;cancer activity against the prostate cancer cells (PC&#8208;3) and found to be highly active at low concentration of 5.77&#8197;&#956;M with IC50 value. Furthermore, HOMO and LUMO levels and energy gap of some selected compounds were calculated by the density functional theory (DFT).

         <title>Halogenation of Alkenes Using Three&#8208;Component Reactions: A Decade of Development</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkenes are valuable feedstocks in organic synthesis. One effective method for synthesizing organic halides with functional groups in close proximity involves the direct difunctionalization of alkenes via three&#8208;component reactions. This approach not only reduces the number of steps involved in the synthesis process, but also minimizes waste generation and enables the formation of complex molecules from simple starting materials. In this review, we mainly discuss decade developments (2013&#8208;2023) in two categories: (1) halogenation via three&#8208;membered ring intermediates, involving haliranium, thiiranium, seleniranium, aziridinium and epoxide species; (2) halogenation via a radical pathway. Reactions with I2, BiI3, NaI, Bu4N+[I(O2CAr)2]&#8208;, NIS, NBS, NCS, DBH, BsNMeBr, HBr, HCl, KI, NH4I, I2O5, Et3N&#183;3HF, Selectfluor, CuI, CuBr, CuCl, LiCl, KBr, NaCl, SOCl2, Py&#183;9HF, NFSI, TBSCl et al have been recorded and how the added reagents work will be discussed. We hope this review will do help for future research in this area.</dc:description>

         <title>Daphnicyclidin Alkaloids 2001&#8211;2023</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article provides a chronological overview of the 23 structurally diverse daphnicyclidin alkaloids isolated to date and highlights the various synthesis contributions that have been published to date on this unique group of alkaloids.







Abstract
The Daphniphyllum alkaloids represent a particularly diverse class of complex diterpene alkaloids, which are characterized by their enormous structural diversity. The daphnicyclidins, a subgroup of these alkaloids, stand out due to their unique pentafulvene structural motif. This review article gives an overview of the compounds that have been isolated so far and can be assigned to this subgroup. Furthermore, all synthesis approaches and total syntheses published to date are presented.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;free Chloroamination Cyclization Cascade with Sodium Hypochlorite: from N&#8208;(Pentenyl)sulfonylamides to 2&#8208;(1&#8208;Chloromethyl)pyrrolidines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
No catalyst is needed to cyclize a sulfonylated aminoalkene in the presence of commercial sodium hypochlorite, a catalytic amount of a base in tetrahydrofuran (THF), thus obtaining valuable 2&#8208;chloromethylpyrrolidines via a domino process and a key nitrogen&#8208;centered radical







Abstract
A mild and catalyst&#8208;free protocol to obtain several 2&#8208;chloromethylpyrrolidines by the use of a commercial solution of sodium hypochlorite is here reported, without the need for a light source. The choice of the solvent revealed to be crucial in the success of the reaction. Mechanistic studies, both experimental and computational, confirmed a radical mechanism, where the deprotonation step, followed by the oxidation of a N&#8208;centered anion to the corresponding radical, allowed 2&#8208;chloromethylpyrrolidines, by a very fast cyclization, to be obtained. Sodium hypochlorite plays the role of both the oxidant and the chlorine source.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationships of Glucose&#8208;based PdII&#8208;Bis(NHC) Complexes in a Model Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sugar&#8208;based NHC&#8208;complexes of palladium(II) have been prepared from glucosyl imidazolium ionic liquid precursors in high yields in a simple synthetic protocol. These complexes enable Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions in ethanol with low catalyst loadings of 0.005&#8197;mol%.







Abstract
The authors of this work have optimized a novel synthetic route towards glucose&#8208;based PdII&#8208;bis(NHC) complexes in only 4 steps with total yields up to 73&#8201;%. The synthesis route encompasses an Appel reaction towards 6&#8208;iodo&#8208;glucopyranosides, followed by acyl&#8208;protection, then quaternization with imidazoles and finally the conversion of these acyl&#8208;protected glucosyl imidazolium salts to their respective palladium(II)bis(NHC) complexes, via an intermediary silver(I) complex. Overall, 11 acyl&#8208;protected glucosyl imidazolium iodides as NHC&#8208;precursors and 15 complexes have been synthesized. The structure&#8208;activity relationships of different functionalizations in these complexes and their reactivity in a model Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura between bromobenzene and 4&#8208;tolueneboronic acid reaction has been investigated, and a highly reactive complex leading to &gt;99&#8201;% yield at 0.005&#8197;mol% catalytic loading has been found.

         <title>Synthesis and Application of Well&#8208;Defined Fluoroalkyl Zinc Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reviewed the preparation and application of these zinc fluoroalkyl complexes, with a focus on recently reported reactions with potential synthetic interest. From the perspective of reaction mechanism, the transfer of trifluoromethyl from zinc complexes to copper catalysts formed the highly active trifluoromethyl copper reagents, which can be directly used for the fluoroalkylation.







Abstract
Fluoroalkyl groups play an irreplaceable role in the field of pharmaceutical and agrochemical industry due to their unique properties. Based on this, it is crucial to effectively introduce fluoroalkyl groups into target molecules. In this review, we describe the synthesis of well&#8208;defined fluoroalkyl zinc complexes and their applications in the fluoroalkylation of compounds. Different from the reactivities of copper fluoroalkyl complexes, fluoroalkyl zinc complexes often needed to be combined with copper or nickel catalysts when participating in fluoroalkylation reactions. From the perspective of reaction mechanism, the transfer of trifluoromethyl from zinc complexes to copper catalysts formed the highly active trifluoromethyl copper reagents, which can be directly used for the fluoroalkylation. In most cases, the desired target products were provided with excellent yields.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Tabernanthine and Ibogaline: Rapid Access to Nosyl Tryptamines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total syntheses of tabernanthine and ibogaline were enabled by application of a thermal coupling of nosyl aziridine and indoles in eight steps each, 10 and 14&#8201;% yield respectively. A Friedel&#8208;Crafts type macrocyclization facilitated key C&#8722;C bond formation. Regio&#8208; and diastereoselective hydroboration&#8208;oxidation of the resultant macrocyclic alkene enabled C&#8722;N bond formation and furnished the completed isoquinuclidine ring system.







Abstract
We describe the first total syntheses of tabernanthine and ibogaline. Entry to these iboga alkaloid natural products is enabled by a thermal coupling of indoles and aziridines to furnish the requisite nosyl tryptamine starting materials. This route features a Friedel&#8208;Crafts type alkylation to form the key indole&#8208;isoquinuclidine C&#8722;C bond. Finally, a regio&#8208; and diastereoselective hydroboration&#8208;oxidation enables C&#8722;N bond formation to close the isoquinuclidine ring system and deliver tabernanthine and ibogaline in 10 and 14&#8201;% yield respectively. Both syntheses were completed in eight steps.

         <title>Synthesis of Noncoded Amino Acids Bearing a Salicylaldehyde Tag for the Design of Reversible&#8208;Covalent Peptides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the design and synthesis of two novel noncoded &#945;&#8208;amino acids, incorporating a lysine&#8208;engaging salicylaldehyde tag on the side chain. These key building blocks open to the versatile positioning of the electrophile tag within peptide sequences, enabling tailored design of reversible&#8208;covalent peptide binders for clinically&#8208;relevant proteins.







Abstract
Insertion of electrophilic species on the structure of small molecule ligands or peptides is a well&#8208;known strategy to increase their binding affinity for the target protein of interest. Among these reactive units, the salicylaldehyde (SA) tag can form remarkably stable imine bonds with the &#1013;&#8208;amino group of lysine, a highly frequent residue in proteins. In this work, we describe the optimized synthesis of two new noncoded &#945;&#8208;amino acids, starting from l&#8208;homoserine and featuring the SA tag on the side chain. One of these final compounds was successfully inserted into a model tripeptide through in&#8208;solution synthesis. These building blocks will allow the versatile insertion of the SA tag at suitable position of peptide sequences, opening to a tailored design of Lys&#8208;engaging peptide ligands.

Described the construction of racemic and enantiopure (D&#8208; and L&#8208;) fluorene&#8208; or fluorenone&#8208;based novel unnatural amino acid scaffolds. A library of fluorene&#8208; or fluorenone motif installed amino acid motifs possessing anti stereochemistry including phenylalanine norvaline, leucine, norleucine, and 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid, alanine, and non&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives was accomplished. This work is a contribution towards enriching fluorene&#8208; or fluorenone&#8208;based (fluorenyl) unnatural amino acid scaffolds.







Abstract
This paper reports the construction of racemic and enantiopure (D&#8208; and L&#8208;) fluorene and fluorenone&#8208;based novel unnatural amino acid derivatives. The Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed bidentate directing group&#8208;aided arylation of prochiral &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds in racemic, enantiopure carboxamides of amino acids with iodofluorenes was reported. The construction of novel examples of fluorene and fluorenone motifs containing amino acids comprising of norvaline, leucine, phenylalanine, norleucine, 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid derivatives having the anti&#8208;stereochemistry (with good enantiopurity) was accomplished. The construction of bis fluorenyl alanine scaffolds and fluorenyl motif&#8208;containing non&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid (aminoalkanoic acid) derivatives was also reported. Examples of removal of the directing group (8&#8208;aminoquinoline) and phthalimide&#8208;protecting group present in the fluorenyl&#8208;based unnatural amino acid derivatives have been shown. Accordingly, fluorene motif&#8208;based amino acid esters and free amino group&#8208;containing unnatural amino acid derivatives were synthesized. The stereochemistry of the major (anti) diastereomers obtained via the prochiral &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H arylation of norvaline, leucine, phenylalanine, norleucine, 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid derivatives was ascertained from the X&#8208;ray structure of a representative compound. Fluorene&#8208; and fluorenone&#8208;based motifs are vital skeletons in materials and medicinal chemistry research. Accordingly, this work is a contribution towards enriching the library of fluorene and fluorenone unnatural amino acid scaffolds.

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Naturally Occurring Cyclic Tetrapeptide JM&#8208;47and Analogues through Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of a Common Scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular protocol for the total synthesis of naturally occurring cyclic tetrapeptide JM&#8208;47 and analogues has been developed and features cross&#8208;metathesis&#8208;based diversification of a macrocyclic scaffold. The synthesis proceeds in good overall yields and with high stereochemical integrity.







Abstract
A unified approach to access the naturally occurring cyclic tetrapeptide JM&#8208;47 and some of its structural variants from a common macrocyclic scaffold has been developed. The key reactions involved a difficult macrocyclization to access the scaffold, and its late&#8208;stage diversification by cross&#8208;metathesis to access the natural product as well as analogues. The synthesis proceeded in good overall yield and high stereochemical integrity. It also confirms the structure and configuration assigned to JM&#8208;47.

         <title>Commercial Transaminases for the Asymmetric Synthesis of Bulky Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Commercially available transaminases are valuable tools for the synthesis of chiral amine building blocks and are very accessible to the synthetic chemistry community. We demonstrate that selected commercially available enzymes from Codexis&#8217; transaminase collection can accept and aminate bulky&#8208;bulky ketones in up to 99&#8201;%&#8201;ee.







Abstract
Transaminase&#8208;catalysed asymmetric amination is a valuable transformation for the synthesis of chiral amines. However, its use in synthetic chemistry has been curtailed by a narrow substrate scope and limited information on commercially available catalysts. In this work we have explored the substrate scope of selected commercially available transaminases, focusing on prochiral ketones bearing two bulky substituents and their application in both enzyme&#8208;catalysed and enzyme&#8208;triggered reactions. (R)&#8208; and/or (S)&#8208;selective enzymes converted methyl&#8208;, isopropyl&#8208;, n&#8208;butyl&#8208;, and cyclohexyl&#8208;phenone substrates to the corresponding amines in the range of 6&#8211;&gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee. In some cases, a stereochemical switch was detected, in which (R)&#8208;enantioselectivity was observed with enzymes typically assigned as (S)&#8208;selective. Upscaling of selected biotransformations provided chiral amines, in &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee and up to 40&#8201;% isolated yield. Furthermore, transaminase&#8208;triggered reactions, which were previously limited to methyl&#8208; and ethyl&#8208;derivatives, were expanded to phenyl&#8208;derivatives for the formation of a cis&#8208;2,6&#8208;disubstituted piperidine and 2,4&#8208;diphenyl pyrroline, and isolated in up to 67&#8201;% yield.

         <title>Direct Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C5&#8208;Arylation of 1,3,4&#8208;Oxadiazoles with Aryl Chlorides Promoted by Bis(di&#8208;isopropylphosphino) Ferrocene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct arylation of 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazoles proceeds efficiently at low catalyst loading (0.5 to 1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) with the decisive assistance of sterically constrained ferrocenyldiphosphane ligands. This protocol tolerates electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on the (heteroaryl)aryl halide.







Abstract
The direct palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazoles with challenging aryl chloride substrates is promoted by the use of a specifically designed electron&#8208;rich ferrocenyl diphosphane. This protocol employs 0.5 to 1.0&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst loading without any additives such as copper or ammonium salts, and equally tolerates electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on the (heteroaryl)aryl halides, as illustrated by the efficient synthesis in 86&#8201;% yield of the anti&#8208;tubercular agent PHOXPY (2&#8208;(5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyrazine) by a late&#8208;stage arylation using 2&#8208;chloropyrazine.

         <title>Decatungstate Catalyzed Benzylic C&#8722;H Trifluoromethylthiolation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a decatungstate catalyzed trifluoromethylthiolation of the benzylic C&#8722;H bond. The reaction features mild conditions and good functional group tolerance, generating corresponding products in moderate to good yields with a slight excess of benzylic substrates or as limiting reagents.







Abstract
Here we report a mild protocol for benzylic C&#8722;H trifluoromethylthiolation using sodium decatungstate (NaDT) as the photocatalyst. Wherein, photoactivated DT abstracted the benzylic hydrogen atom via a radical process. This transformation works well with a slight excess of benzylic substrates or as limiting reagents for better purification. The reaction shows mild conditions and good functional group tolerance. Moreover, the protocol could be applied to gram&#8208;scale synthesis.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;ones were prepared by an efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot reaction of arylhydrazides, arylboronic acids and DMF. Moderate to good yield of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;ones were obtained using DMF as the carbonyl source and arylboronic as the aryl source. This reaction involved ligand exchange and transmetalation of copper catalysts with arylhydrazides and arylboric acids, followed by reductive elimination and intramolecular cyclization. Compared to the previous work, this work employs the stable and readily available aryl hydrazide and arylboronic substrates that enhance the practicality of this strategy, and this strategy features a short reaction time, relatively low heating temperature, convenient and more secure. Further, this protocol has the features of high functional group tolerance and reaction scalability.</dc:description>

They were reacted with 2&#8208;benzofuryl&#8208; and 2&#8208;benzothienyllithiums to form symmetrical and unsymmetrical diarylketones, or underwent deprotolithiation&#8208;electrophilic trapping sequences at their 3 position. From 3&#8208;iodinated derivatives, copper&#8208;catalysed N&#8208;arylation of azoles was performed, followed by lithium amide&#8208;promoted cyclisation, to give &#8216;tripentone&#8217; analogues. The diarylketones were also iodinated at their 3,3&#8217; positions and then engaged in the copper&#8208;promoted double N&#8208;arylation of anilines, giving rise to a family of original pentacyclic derivatives. A preliminary assessment of their electrochemical and biological properties was carried out, showing promising results against the proliferation of melanoma cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Formal [4+2] Cycloaddition of Ethynylethylene Carbonates for the Construction of 3,4&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[b][1,4]oxazines</title>

         <dc:description>
A formal [4+2] cycloaddition reaction of ethynylethylene carbonates and 2&#8208;aminophenols has been developed successfully for the synthesis of a series of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[b][1,4]oxazine derivatives.







Abstract
A formal [4+2] cycloaddition reaction of ethynylethylene carbonates and 2&#8208;aminophenols has been developed for the synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[b][1,4]oxazines bearing quaternary carbon atoms. The reaction features mild reaction conditions, good functional group compatibility and good yields. Furthermore, when using chiral PyBox ligand, this strategy could also achieve the asymmetric synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[b][1,4]oxazines. Application studies indicated that the hydroxymethyl group of final products was an excellent functional group that can be further modified easily.

         <title>High Yield Synthesis of Spirocyclic Dienones from Phenols Employing Tribromide Catalysed Dearomatization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalytic strategy towards the tribromide&#8208;catalyzed dearomative spirocyclization reaction is described employing tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) and oxone as an oxidising agent. This methodology leads to the exclusive formation of spirofurano dienones without rearomatization or halogenation. Our group has been on trails of tribromide&#8208;catalyzed dearomative transformation during the last decade, and now this exhibits the first report which delivers high functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope with excellent yield (up to 99%) and good diastereoselectivity (dr up to 14:1).&#160;The oxidation of naphthols as well as phenols is achieved under this mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Fluorinated organic compounds represent an important and growing family of active ingredients in various fields, including material science, pharmaceutical chemistry and biological science. Developing efficient synthetic methods toward fluorinated organic compounds have attracted much attention. In recent years, transition&#8208;metal catalyzed reaction of trifluoro diazo compounds involving trifluoro diazo compounds and their surrogates were a powerful and convenient approach to afford trifluoromethyl&#8208; and difluoromethyl&#8208;substituted compounds of value. In this review, the recent progress in this area is described in the sequence of 2,2,2&#8208;trifluorodiazoethane as carbene precursor, ethyl 3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;diazo&#8208;propionate as carbene precursor, trifluoroethyl amines/amine hydrochloride as the CF3CHN2 surrogate as well as trifluoro aldehydes/ketones N&#8208;sulfonylhydrazones as the trifluoro diazo compounds surrogate.</dc:description>

         <title>2&#8208; and 3&#8208;Fluorocyclobutane Building Blocks for Organic and Medicinal Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multigram synthesis of 3&#8208;fluorinated cyclobutane building blocks has been disclosed. The proposed synthetic schemes were based on the nucleophilic fluorination and eventually led to 3&#8208;fluorocyclocutanecarboxylic acid as a key target compound and intermediate. Further functional group transformations provided monofluorinated cyclobutane&#8208;derived alcohols, amines, bromides, thiols, sulfonyl chlorides, etc. Furthermore, the synthesis of diastereopure cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;isomeric 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;fluorocyclobutane&#173;carboxylic acids and amines was also performed. In both cases, diastereomer separation was used to obtain pure stereoisomers. The effect of the fluorine position and relative spatial orientation on the physicochemical properties of the corresponding monoflurinated derivatives was studied by measurements of pKa and logP values.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Functionalization of para&#8208;Quinones: A Historical Review and New Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct functionalization of quinones has always fascinated research communities due to their biological and redox activities and subsequent application. Quinone motifs play a vital role as precursors for many bioactive compounds and materials; hence, many ingenious methodologies have been elaborated for exploring these units. A significant part of the synthetic strategies towards the functionalized quinones has been achieved by installing substituents on hydroquinones, phenols, or quinone itself by different oxidative coupling reactions via radical pathways with or without the utilization of metal catalysts. The functionalization of simple quinones via direct C&#8208;H bond remains challenging due to their inherited electronic nature and high bond dissociation energy. This review article summarizes the recent advancement made for functionalized quinones through direct functionalization of simple quinones. Our primary focus will be on the synthetic approaches and mechanistic pathways of these reactions that have appeared in the last two decades, along with a short historical importance of the quinone family.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemistry in Organic Synthesis: An Italian Journey through Innovations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemistry, as an enabling technology, harnesses mechanical force to drive chemical reactions, presenting compelling advantages in organic synthesis within the principles of green chemistry.&#160;This review explores how its unique advantages and alignment with sustainable practices have been widely developed in different scientific fields in Italy. As a transformative strategy for organic synthesis, mechanochemistry has been portrayed in this review as a valuable synthetic alternative due to the various advantages, such as solvent reduction and new reaction pathways, that its use brings. Nonetheless, the improvements brought about by its use have also been crucial in other fields of chemistry described by Italian scientists. In this whole context, Italian researchers have analysed both already optimised processes and new feasible pathways, paving the way for new avenues previously hampered by all the limitations that belong to in&#8208;solution chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of a Cobalt Catalyst from ZIF&#8208;67 and Application in the Hydrogenation of N&#8208;Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogenation of N&#8208;heteroarenes to saturated N&#8208;heterocycles is an important reaction in organic synthesis. Hydrogen is a green&#8208;reducing reagent and has been widely applied in industrial production. The development of an appropriate catalyst to realize hydrogenation under low pressure and temperature is desired. In this study, we developed a cobalt&#8208;based catalyst derived from ZIF&#8208;67, and it exhibits high activity for N&#8208;heteroarene hydrogenation under 5&#8208;20 bar hydrogen, which is relatively low compared to reported catalytic systems. This nano&#8208;cobalt catalyst shows a broad substrate scope and can be reused without obvious activity loss.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Propargyl Sulfides as Radical Trappers for the Synthesis of Sulfonyl Allenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work showcases a novel visible&#8208;light mediated allenylation protocol employing propargyl sulfides as a pioneering radical trapping methodology. A diverse array of substituted sulfonyl allenes were successfully synthesized under mild conditions with commendable levels of chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selectivity. Mechanistically, this process entails the formation of sulfonyl radicals, their subsequent addition to alkynes, the subsequent elimination of S&#8208;centered radicals, and Cl&#8208;atom abstraction, thereby facilitating the propagation of this radical chain reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Stability, Meisenheimer Complex Formation, and Charge&#8208;Transfer Properties of Ultra&#8208;Electron&#8208;Deficient Tetracyano&#8208;Naphthalene Diimides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetra&#8208;cyano substituted naphthalene diimides (TCNDIs) with calculated LUMO of &#8208;5.2 eV, form one of the strongest electron&#8208;acceptors known to date. However, the synthesis and isolation of this class of molecules remain challenging due to its reactivity emanating from its ultra&#8208;electron&#8208;deficiency. Herein we have established an improved synthetic methodology of TCNDIs with cost&#8208;effective reagents and circumventing metallic catalysts. The synthesis is amenable to TCNDIs with the shortest axial alkyl groups, i.e., methyl group and also longer alkyl chains. We also gained insight on how axial alkyl chain lengths influence electron&#8208;deficiency, Meisenheimer complex formation, reactivity, and charge&#8208;transfer of TCNDIs from computation, spectroscopy, and electrochemical studies. The TCNDIs with Me/Et axial groups were found to be more susceptible to moist solvents vis&#8208;&#224;&#8208;vis the TCNDIs with longer alkyl groups. The single crystal structures of the TCNDIs show infinitely &#960;&#8208;stacked structure, and a new C=O&#183;&#183;&#183;C&#8801;N or C&#8801;N&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; motif is discerned. Finally, toluene&#8208;mediated charge&#8208;transfer properties of TCNDIs in the single crystals as well as in solution have been examined.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Insights into Cinchona&#8208;Based Phase Transfer Catalysis

for Asymmetric Conjugate Cyanation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of asymmetric organic molecules has experienced a huge development over the last
few decades. Phase&#8208;transfer catalysis has been proven to be one of the most powerful methods
for these asymmetric transformations. However, the study of the mechanism of these catalysts and
the different interactions that they can establish with the reactants has failed to keep pace. In the
present study, the conjugate cyanation of two different &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones are studied in the
presence of a well&#8208;known alkaloid quinine&#8208;derived PTC, along with different modifications. The study
includes the comparison of different binding modes between the catalysts and the different reactants,
the mechanistic study of the reaction and the analysis of the non&#8208;covalent interactions established
within the complexes and their role in the global enantioselectivity of the process.</dc:description>

The formation of the two new C&#8722;C bonds proceeds through a Michael addition followed by a cyclization. Such reactions are usually difficult with pronucleophiles not bearing an additional geminal electron&#8208;withdrawing group. Operational simplicity, transition metal&#8208;free mild conditions, high yields and excellent regio&#8208; and diastereocontrol are advantages of this protocol.







Abstract
Efficient cyclopropanation reactions of aryl or styrylacetonitriles with vinyl selenones under mild conditions were described. By this approach, synthetically challenging 1&#8208;vinylcyclopropane&#8208;1&#8208;carbonitriles were accessible in good yields. This methodology features the advantage of operational simplicity, broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, mild temperature, and a high level of regio&#8208; and diastereo&#8208;control.

         <title>Synthesis of Sulfo(xo)nium Diacylmethylides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfo(xo)nium diacylmethylides as stable and readily prepared sulfur ylides are versatile synthons. This concept article summarizes their synthetic methods, including the condensation of active methylene compounds with sulfides/sulfoxides, transylidations of diazo compounds and iodonium ylides with sulfides/sulfoxides, acylation of sulfo(xo)nium monoacylmethylides, and the reaction of electron&#8208;deficient alkynes and sulfoxides. Their substrate scopes, proposed mechanisms, selected product examples, limitations, and applications are discussed.







Abstract
Sulfo(xo)nium diacylmethylides (sulfur ylides) are simple, stable, readily prepared, and versatile synthons. Compared with the sulfo(xo)nium monoacylmethylides, they can be compatible with more rigorous reaction conditions and showcase unique characteristics due to their excellent stability. This concept article provides an account for the syntheses of sulfo(xo)nium diacylmethylides, including the utilization of active methylene compounds, carbene precursors, sulfo(xo)nium monoacylmethylides, and electron&#8208;deficient alkynes as substrates, with discussions on substrate scopes, proposed mechanisms, selected product examples, and applications. Challenges for further exploration and prospect on sulfo(xo)nium diacylmethylides in the future are also suggested.

         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free carbonyl reduction and hydrodefluorination of &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethyl enones with hydrosilanes was developed for the synthesis of a variety of gem&#8208;difluorovinyl alcohols. The hydrosilane could act as both a reductive agent and a C(sp3)&#8208;F bond&#8208;breaking promoter under mild reaction conditions. Synthetically useful organofluorides could be readily constructed by the further transformations of the obtained products.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Enabling Cyanation of Electron&#8208;poor Carbons with Acetone Cyanohydrin</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein is reported an electrochemical procedure based on the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction of acetone cyanohydrin at a Pt cathode enabling the cyanation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208; unsaturated carbonyl and imines. Catalytic current, along with a correspondingly reduced quantity of supporting electrolyte, facilitates the scalability of the procedure, ensuring brief electrolysis times while maintaining a simple electrochemical design.







Abstract
The Pt&#8208;cathode hydrogen evolution reaction (Pt&#8208;HER) of acetone cyanohydrin provides an alternative method for introducing the cyano group onto electrophilic carbons of imines and chalcones. The synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles and &#946;&#8208;cyano ketones has been achieved smoothly with a small excess of cyanating agent (2 equivalent), catalytic amount of supporting electrolyte and low electricity consumption (0.02&#8197;F/mol). Besides demonstrating a general atom economy, the high Faradaic efficiency, allows for a scale&#8208;up with low&#8208;demanding electrochemical design and short electrolysis times.

         <title>Direct Introduction of an Acetyl Group at the &#945;&#8208;Carbon Atom of an Arene Ring through an Amide Photo&#8208;Fries Rearrangement upon Exposure to UV Light</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;Fries rearrangement using benzoheterocyclic compounds, which are widely used in pharmaceuticals, was studied. Under ultraviolet (UV) light, benzoheterocyclic compounds containing an N&#8208;acetyl group underwent rearrangement of the acyl group directly to the &#945;&#8208;position past the adjacent bridgehead carbon. This environmentally friendly method could be useful in organic synthesis, the pharmaceutical industry, and biochemistry.







Abstract
We employed an amide photo&#8208;Fries rearrangement for the synthesis benzoheterocyclic compounds and found that direct acylation of the &#945;&#8208;carbon atom in an arene ring can occur upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. In this reaction, the N&#8208;acetyl group of amides underwent rearrangement to the &#945;&#8208;position across the bridgehead carbon atom under UV&#8722;C light. The reaction conditions were gentle and safe. Moreover, this reaction proves to be more convenient for selectively manipulating benzoheterocyclic compounds in comparison to traditional approaches involving Lewis acid catalysts or anionic reagents.

         <title>Electrochemical Decarboxylative Addition of N&#8208;Aryl Glycines to Enaminones: Access to C3&#8208;Aminomethyl Chromones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical decarboxylative addition of N&#8208;substituted glycines to enaminones has been developed for the synthesis of C3&#8208;aminomethyl chromones. The products could be generated under oxidant&#8208;, catalyst&#8208;, and light&#8208;free conditions at room temperature, and could act as valuable building blocks to construct polysubstituted pyrimidines with potential bioactivities.







Abstract
An electrochemical decarboxylative addition of N&#8208;substituted glycines to enaminones has been developed and conducted under oxidant&#8208;, catalyst&#8208;, and light&#8208;free conditions in acetonitrile at room temperature by using electron as the traceless oxidant, which provided a green approach to C3&#8208;aminomethyl chromones. The resulting products were formed through radical addition/oxidation/cyclization or electrophilic addition/cyclization pathway and could act as valuable building blocks to construct polysubstituted pyrimidine derivatives.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalysed syn&#8208;Selective Arylnickelation and Cyclisation of Ketone/Imine&#8208;Tethered Terminal Alkynes with Arylboronic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein the substrate scope of a nickel&#8208;catalysed syn&#8208;selective arylnickelation and cyclisation with arylboronic acids is expanded to include ketone and imine&#8208;tethered terminal alkynes. The reaction proceeds via a syn&#8208;aryl nickelation of a terminal alkyne followed by cyclisation of the resulting alkenylnickel species. Along with this the first enantioselective version of the reaction has been developed using PHIM type P,N ligands.







Abstract
Herein we report a syn&#8208;arylnickelative cyclisation with ketone&#8208; and imine&#8208;tethered terminal alkynes (16 examples) in yields of up to 89&#8201;%. The reaction proceeds via a syn&#8208;aryl nickelation of a terminal alkyne followed by cyclisation of the resulting alkenylnickel species onto the ketone or imine. The enantioselective version of this transformation has also been explored with enantioselectivities of up to 83&#8201;:&#8201;17&#8197;er observed.

This study demonstrates an efficient dearomative hydroalkylation of indoles using alkanes or ethers as alkyl radical sources and TBADT as a cost&#8208;effective photocatalyst for direct hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). Successful conversion of these heterocyclic derivatives into 2&#8208;alkylindolines with good to excellent yields and high diastereoselectivity is achieved under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Application of the Photo&#8208;Fries Reaction as a Key Step in the Preparation of Valuable Aryloxyethyl Selenocyanates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multistep straightforward sequence involving the photo&#8208;Fries rearrangement reaction as a key step has been developed for the preparation of aryl selenocyanate WC&#8208;9 analogues. Derivatization the resulting 2&#8208;hydroxyphenones bearing alkyl chains and a phenyl group, followed by acid deprotection, tosylation (or mesylation) and finally treatment with potassium selenocyanate provided the target analogues in good yields.







Abstract
A multistep sequence leads to the preparation of a series of aryl selenocyanate WC&#8208;9 homologues, which are interesting compounds with potential biological activity against Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. The synthetic sequence involves the application of the photo&#8208;Fries rearrangement reaction as a key step for the preparation of a series of 2&#8208;hydroxyphenones bearing alkyl chains of different length and a phenyl group. These intermediates are obtained upon direct irradiation (254&#8197;nm) of 4&#8208;phenoxyphenyl esters in different solvents at room temperature. Then, reaction of the 2&#8208;hydroxyphenones with 2&#8208;(2&#8208;bromoethoxy)tetrahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran followed by acid deprotection, tosylation (or mesylation) reaction and, finally, nucleophilic attack with potassium selenocyanate provides the target aryloxyethyl selenocyanate homologues in good yields.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Sterically Hindered &#945;&#8208;Allyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Aryl Lactams via Palladium&#8208;Catalysed Decarboxylative Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation</title>

         <dc:description>
The Pd&#8208;catalysed decarboxylative asymmetric allylic alkylation (DAAA) of sterically hindered &#945;&#8208;aryl,&#946;&#8208;amido allyl ester lactams has been developed. The key step in the synthesis of a range of &#945;&#8208;aryl lactam substrates for catalysis was a Pb&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;arylation. A substrate scope of 11 examples of DAAA showed that products containing the di&#8208;ortho&#8208;methoxy&#8208;substituted phenyls and naphthyl groups gave rise to the highest enantioselctivities of up to 82&#8201;% ee.

The key step in the synthesis of a range of &#945;&#8208;aryl lactam substrates for catalysis was a Pb&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;arylation of a &#946;&#8208;amido allyl ester affording 14 novel examples of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amido allyl ester lactams in good yields (up to 80&#8201;%). The Pd&#8208;catalysed DAAA was optimised with the 2,4,6&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl&#8208;containing substrate. Using (S,S)&#8208;DACH&#8208;phenyl Trost as the optimal chiral ligand, enantioselectivities of up to 82&#8201;% ee were obtained. A substrate scope of 11 examples of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amido allyl ester lactams showed that products containing the di&#8208;ortho&#8208;methoxy&#8208;substituted phenyls and naphthyl groups gave rise to the highest ees, whereas products not bearing this substitution pattern showed lower enantioselectivities (&lt;60&#8201;% ee). Transition states to rationalise the observed stereochemical outcome are proposed.

         <title>Iron Photocatalysis Applied to Oxidative Amidation of Aldehydes with NaCl</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated oxidative amidation of aldehydes promoted by a photoactive complex of Fe2SO4 with 2&#8208;picolinic acid, NaCl as a chlorine source, Na2SO8 as an oxidant, and acetone as the solvent is reported. Fe2SO4 is an earth&#8208;abundant metal salt that is commercially readily available and environmentally sustainable. Sodium chloride is a green and sustainable chlorine source.







Abstract
A synthesis of amides from aldehydes promoted by the photoactive complex of Fe2SO4 with 2&#8208;picolinic acid, NaCl as a chlorine source, and Na2S2O8 as a benign oxidant is reported. The reaction is mediated by visible light and is carried out at room temperature in the absence of additives. Fe2SO4 is a readily available earth&#8208;abundant metal (EAMs) salt, which does not need to be prepared and is environmentally sustainable. Both aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes and mono&#8208; and disubstituted amines have been investigated for this transformation. This study opens intriguing perspectives for extending the application of photoactive complex iron salts toward halogenation processes as well as for C&#8722;H activation reactions and contributes to the field of earth&#8208;abundant metal based catalysis.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Electrooxidative Annulation of Naphthol with Acrylate via C&#8722;H Bond Activation for the Synthesis of Naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]furan</title>

         <dc:description>
We have sythesized naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]furan derivatives using iridium catalyzed electrochemical coupling of naphthol and acrylates. Ir&#8208;catalyzed oxidant&#8208;free electrochemical C&#8722;H annulation is achieved by electrooxidative C&#8722;H acrylation via weak O&#8208;coordination. This method does not require additives and external chemical oxidants in the syntheses of naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]furans.







Abstract
Iridium catalyzed electrochemical coupling of naphthols with acrylates for the syntheses of naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]furan derivatives are herein reported. Ir&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical C&#8722;H annulation is accomplished within a supportive catalysis manifold, paving the way for electrooxidative C&#8722;H acrylation via weak O&#8208;coordination. The merge of iridium catalysts and electric current not only minimizes the need for a stoichiometric amount of chemical oxidants but also confirms broad reaction compatibility with a variety of electronically and sterically diverse substrates. This utility provides a valuable method for producing a wide range of naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]furan derivatives in good to moderate yields.

         <title>Selective Oxidation of Sufur&#8208;Containing Flavones: Synthesis of Sulfoxide/Sulfone&#8208;Flavonoids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocol is proposed for the selective oxidation of flavones, providing various sulfoxide/sulfone&#8208;flavonoids in excellent yields. This strategy features excellent selectivities, high yields and broad substrate scope. The combination of oxone (2KHSO5&#183;KHSO4&#183;K2SO4) as the sole oxidant and NaHCO3/Na2CO3&#160;as the buffer play an important role in the process, in which the amounts of oxone and reaction temperatures are the key to the outstanding selectivities and high efficiency of the reaction. It should be noteworthy that a class of novel sulfone&#8208;flavonols is also synthesized through triple oxidation. Moreover, the glycosylation of sulfone&#8208;flavonols has been realized.</dc:description>

         <title>The Inorganic Ligand&#8208;Supported Copper Catalyst Catalyzing Alkyne Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using (NH4)4[CuMo6O18(OH)6] as the catalyst, accelerates the Glaser&#8208;Hay coupling of alkynes under easy conditions with moderate&#8208;to&#8208;high yields. Both symmetric and asymmetric couplings can be achieved with high selectivity. In addition, the catalyst is non&#8208;toxic, green, environment&#8208;friendly, and it can be recycled for at least six times while maintaining the catalytic activity.







Abstract
Glaser&#8208;coupled synthesized 1,3&#8208;diyne can participate in the generation of conjugated polymers and is now widely used in organic and polymer synthesis. Currently, the catalyst in coupling are mostly based on the complexation of noble metals with complex organic ligands, which inevitably increases the research cost and storage difficulty. However, polyoxometalates (POMs), with acidic and redox properties, can be used as an excellent inorganic ligands with low cost and easy storage. In this work, we have synthesized copper catalyst 1, (NH4)4[CuMo6O18(OH)6] with polyoxometalates as inorganic ligands in a facile way and applied them in the coupling of alkynes to obtain (non)symmetrical conjugated 1,3&#8208;diynes in high yields without bases, finally proposing a reasonable reaction path. In addition, the catalyst showed good tolerance to a variety of different groups, further demonstrating its excellent catalytic activity. It is worth mentioning that the catalyst maintained its good structure and activity after six cycles, demonstrating its promising potential for industrial applications. Thus, this paper provides a new strategy for the preparation of (un)symmetrical diynes using polyoxometalates of Cu as catalyst, and also demonstrates the potential of multi&#8208;acid catalyst for organocatalytic applications.

In this work, we have synthesized copper catalyst &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[CuMo&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] with polyoxometalates as inorganic ligands in a facile way and applied them in the coupling of alkynes to obtain (non)symmetrical conjugated 1,3-diynes in high yields without bases, finally proposing a reasonable reaction path. In addition, the catalyst showed good tolerance to a variety of different groups, further demonstrating its excellent catalytic activity. It is worth mentioning that the catalyst maintained its good structure and activity after six cycles, demonstrating its promising potential for industrial applications. Thus, this paper provides a new strategy for the preparation of (un)symmetrical diynes using polyoxometalates of Cu as catalyst, and also demonstrates the potential of multi-acid catalyst for organocatalytic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Two epimeric pairs of N&#8208;Ts&#8208;protected cyclohexylamines that incorporate an unsaturated side&#8208;chain at the C2 position have been prepared. Contrary to expectations, none of these underwent clean, photochemically&#8208;induced intramolecular hydroamination reactions to give the corresponding perhydro&#8208;indole or &#8208;quinolines. However, they did participate in efficient olefin cross metathesis (OCM) reactions with methyl crotonate.

         <title>A Perspective on Centrohexaindane Chemistry and a Deep&#8208;Sleeping &#8220;Cartesian&#8221; Seed</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple functionalization of the unique three&#8208;dimensional framework of centrohexaindane is discussed in terms of known and yet unknown substitution patterns at the molecular periphery. The potential to employ centrohexaindane derivatives for various molecular extensions in the 3&#8208;space, including the generation of three&#8208;dimensional organic networks based on the C17&#8208;centrohexaquinacene motif, is addressed as a perspective.







Abstract
Centrohexaindane (C41H24), a structurally unique polyaromatic hydrocarbon bearing six mutually fused indane wings stretched out along the Cartesian axes of space, may be viewed as a seed for the construction of covalent and supramolecular three&#8208;dimensional frameworks. A kaleidoscope of established and yet&#8208;to&#8208;be&#8208;explored aspects of centrohexaindane chemistry is presented in this article. After addressing some ideas about the naked centrohexacyclic (and topologically nonplanar) C17&#8208;core, which can be considered a &#8220;centrohexaquinacyne&#8221;, the diversity of known but mostly unknown functionalization patterns at the framework of centrohexaindane is addressed in increasing order of substitution at the twelve equivalent peripheral positions. The variety of centrohexaindanes bearing three identical groups is displayed including a very first access to a centrohexaindane that bears a C3&#8208;symmetrically functionalized tribenzotriquinacene (TBTQ) unit and, thus, a potential for 3D oligocondensation. The diversity of known tetra&#8208; and hexasubstituted centrohexaindane derivatives is presented and conceivable synthesis strategies are discussed for even more highly functionalized derivatives. Finally, the successful access to centrohexaindanes with exhaustive functionalization and hydrocarbon extension at the twelve peripheral positions completes this overview on what may be a vastly open field, still.

         <title>Synthesis and Application of a New Class of Planar and Centrally Chiral Ferrocenyl Amino Alcohol Ligands</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 18, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly enantioselective, facile, scalable, and robust synthesis of a new family (14 examples) of amino alcohol ligands possessing planar and central chirality that is described. They were applied to the diethylzinc and diphenylzinc additions to aldehydes with up to 98&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee and 82&#8201;% yield and 88&#8201;% ee, respectively.







Abstract
A family of ferrocenyl amino alcohols (14 examples) has been prepared from the corresponding planar chiral ketones and evaluated as a new class of chiral ligands for asymmetric ethyl&#8208; and phenylzinc additions to aldehydes. The highly enantioselective synthesis of these ligands is facile, scalable, robust and relies on the use of cheaply available starting materials. Asymmetric ethyl additions proceeded smoothly at ambient temperature, with reaction times as short as 1&#8197;hour furnishing the desired products in up to 90&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee. The corresponding phenyl additions afforded products in up to 81&#8201;% yield and 88&#8201;% ee. The observed stereochemical outcome for the addition of diethylzinc was rationalized and the key proposed transition state was supported by an analysis of the X&#8208;ray structures of a series of amino alcohol ligands.

A photocatalyst&#8208;free visible&#8208;light protocol was developed to access a variety of 3&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;methoxyisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones. Two initiation mechanisms proved to be effective for transformation.







Abstract
Aryl diazonium salts are versatile compounds known for their reactivity in various transformations. In this study, we explored the arylation of 3&#8208;methylene isoindolinones using aryl diazonium salts. The objective was to develop a method for accessing 3&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;methoxyisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones, a class of compounds with diverse biological activities and synthetic importance. Optimization of the reaction conditions revealed the significance of light irradiation for improved yields. The substrate scope investigation demonstrated the compatibility of various diazonium salts and N&#8208;substituents on the 3&#8208;methylene isoindolinone scaffold, yielding the corresponding methoxy lactams with high yields. Mechanistic insights were obtained by observing the effect of base and light irradiation. Two initiation mechanisms were proposed: in the presence of a base, the reaction could proceed even without light irradiation, while light irradiation was necessary in the absence of a base. DFT calculations were performed to elucidate the mechanism of the reaction and provide energetic considerations

We describe the one&#8208;pot direct N&#8208;acylation of indazole with carboxylic acids using DMAPO/Boc2O system. This system is simple and provides N1&#8208;acyl indazoles in high yield with high N1 selectivities. This new method exhibits a wide substrate scope (&gt;40 examples). In addition, a new synthesis of N1&#8208;functionalized alkyl indazoles utilizing N1&#8208;acyl indazoles as starting materials was achieved.







Abstract
This report describes the one&#8208;pot direct N&#8208;acylation of indazole with carboxylic acids using our previously developed 4&#8208;(N,N&#8208;dimethylamino)pyridine N&#8208;oxide (DMAPO)/di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl dicarbonate (Boc2O) system. This simple system provides N1&#8208;acyl indazoles in high yield with high N1 selectivities and does not require the use of activated derivatives of carboxylic acids or high temperatures. This new method exhibits a wide substrate scope (&gt;40 examples). In addition, a new synthesis of N1&#8208;functionalized alkyl indazoles utilizing N1&#8208;acyl indazoles as starting materials was achieved. This stepwise protocol is useful for the selective synthesis of structurally diverse N1&#8208;functionalized alkyl indazoles, which are difficult to synthesize by other methods such as the Mitsunobu reaction and classical SN2 alkylation of indazole.

         <title>Chiroptical Properties of a Cryptophane Soluble at Neutral pH</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 18, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anti&#8208;cryptophane&#8208;3 derivative sequesters cesium and thallium cations in aqueous solutions. This article describes the synthesis of the two enantiomers of compound 3 as well as the determination of their absolute configuration by VCD spectroscopy associated with DFT calculations. An ECD spectroscopy study assesses the ability of cesium and thallium to induce conformational changes in compound 3.







Abstract
This article reports the synthesis of the two enantiomers of a water&#8208;soluble cryptophane 3 enabling cesium and thallium complexation at neutral or basic pH. The two enantiomers of 3 were obtained in a two steps synthesis from cryptophane 4, a molecule decorated with three phenol groups and three other phenol groups protected by benzyl units. The two enantiomers of 4 were isolated from liquid chromatography using chiral stationary phase. The absolute configuration of the two enantiomers of 3 was determined by vibrational circular dichroism combined with theoretical calculations. Contrary to cryptophane 1 that present large spectroscopic changes upon cesium and thallium complexation, the electronic circular dichroism spectra of compound 3 exhibit moderate spectral changes suggesting that this compound cannot change the conformation of its linkers as easily as cryptophane 1.

         <title>NIS/TEMPO&#8208;Promoted Oxidative Cyanation and Nitro&#8208;Mannich Reaction of Tertiary Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 18, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
NIS/TEMPO&#8208;mediated procedure for the C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reaction of tertiary amines with trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) and nitroalkanes was developed. The N&#8208;Mannich base formed from the tertiary amine and NIS had a stabilizing effect on the iminium intermediate.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free N&#8208;iodosuccinimde (NIS)/2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyloxy (TEMPO)&#8208;promoted protocol was developed for the oxidative cyanation and nitro&#8208;Mannich reaction of tertiary amines via a cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reaction under mild conditions. Several control experiments were performed; the coupling reaction outcomes indicated that the C&#8722;N coupled intermediate (N&#8208;Mannich base) formed from the tertiary amine and NIS had a stabilizing effect on the iminium cation.

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed One&#8208;Pot Multi&#8208;Step Synthesis of N&#8208;Polyheterocycles from Nitroarenes and Glycols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 18, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem process for the synthesis of N&#8208;polyheterocycles from easily available nitroarenes catalyzed by a dioxomolybdenum(VI) complex is described, where the byproduct generated in the first step is incorporated into the final structure. A broad variety of nitrogenated compounds are synthesized in overall good yields in a one&#8208;pot manner.







Abstract
We report the efficient, sustainable one&#8208;pot synthesis of a wide variety of N&#8208;polyheterocycles, such as imidazo&#8208;quinolines and quinoxalines, and furoquinolines, from easily available nitroaromatics and glycols via a molybdenum catalytic domino reduction&#8208;imine formation&#8208;intramolecular cyclization&#8208;oxidation sequence. It is worth highlighting that the recycling and incorporation of the waste carbonyl byproduct, generated in the reduction step, into the final compound is realized. In addition, the overall efficiency and atom economy of the process are further improved owing to the participation of one reaction intermediate as reductant that allows lowering the amount of external reducing agent employed.

Abstract
The treatment of diethyl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydroaminophosphonate&#8197;1 with various arenes (ArH=toluene 2&#8201;a, benzene 2&#8201;b, anisole 2&#8201;c, bromobenzene 2&#8201;d, chlorobenzene 2&#8201;e, benzyl alcohol 2&#8201;f, p&#8208;xylene 2&#8201;g) in acetic acid (AcOH) at 120&#8201;&#176;C for 8&#8197;h in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 (10&#8201;%&#8201;mol, OAc=acetate) and AgOAc (3.4&#8197;equivalents) results in the formation of the corresponding &#946;&#8208;aryl derivatives E&#8208;Ar(H)C=C(NHAc)P(O)(OEt)2 3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;g. The reaction proceeds through double C&#8722;H activation (arene and alkene) and subsequent C&#8722;C oxidative coupling (Fujiwara&#8211;Moritani reaction), processes catalyzed by Pd and assisted by Ag. The obtained products 3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;g are isosteric analogs of phenylalanine and are obtained with high selectivity. Thus, geometrical E&#8208;isomers have been obtained in all studied cases, however mixtures of ortho&#8208;/meta&#8208;/para&#8208;isomers are observed when the activated position in the starting arene 2 is considered.

         <title>SO2F2&#8208;Mediated Thioesterification of Carboxylic Acids with Thiols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 18, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article described the thioesterification of carboxylic acids with thiols through the activation of sulfonyl fluoride (SO2F2). The presented one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step protocol was compatible with aryl/alkyl carboxylic acid including drug molecules.







Abstract
The generation of thioesters through thioesterification of carboxylic acid has significant synthetic value given the easy availability of various carboxylic acids and the extensive application of thioesters. An economical and rapid thioester synthesis approach is still needed. Herein, we achieved thioesterification of carboxylic acids with valuable glycosyl thiol, aromatic and aliphatic thiols mediated by sulfonyl fluoride (SO2F2). The compatibility of numerous carboxylic acid substrates was tested, including (hetero)aromatic and aliphatic carboxylic acids and the reaction proceeded smoothly under mild conditions at good yields. Late&#8208;stage modification of drug molecules rac&#8208;Naproxen and Loxoprofen proved feasible. Besides, the gram&#8208;scale reaction demonstrated the utility of this protocol.

         <title>Investigations on Superbase Mediated Reactivity of N&#8208;Tosylhydrazones with Aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;Quinone Methide Precursors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 18, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigations were made on the chemoselectivity in superbase&#8208;mediated reactions of N&#8208;tosylhydrazones with aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide precursors. Under super basic conditions, the reaction of N&#8208;tosylhydrazone with ortho&#8208;aminobenzyl afforded 2&#8208;substituted quinoline while the reaction of former with N&#8208;(2&#8208;(chloromethyl)phenyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylbenzenesulfonamide furnished azine sulphonamides.







Abstract
We have encountered a superbase&#8208;mediated chemoselective reaction of N&#8208;tosylhydrazones with aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide precursors. When tosylhydrazone was treated with ortho&#8208;aminobenzyl alcohol in super basic conditions (KOH+DMSO), we observed the formation of 2&#8208;substituted quinoline. The reaction was found to be general, and by this method, mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted quinolines could be made. We could prove experimentally and theoretically that the reaction proceeded via the formation of an azine from the basic decomposition of N&#8208;tosylhydrazones. Finally, the reaction of tosylhydrazone with N&#8208;(2&#8208;(chloromethyl)phenyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylbenzenesulfonamide (aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide precursor) under super basic conditions afforded hydrazine substituted sulfonamides.

         <title>Selective Transformation of 1,3&#8208;Cyclooctadiene into Novel Functionalized Azaheterocycles, &#946;&#8208;Amino Esters, and Lactams by Means of Ring&#8208;Rearrangement Metathesis</title>

Diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of some novel functionalized azaheterocyclic &#946;&#8208;amino esters with multiple chiral centers from 1,3&#8208;cyclooctadiene&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;amino acids has been accomplished through stereocontrolled metathesis protocols.







Abstract
Diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of some novel functionalized azaheterocyclic &#946;&#8208;amino esters with multiple chiral centers from 1,3&#8208;cyclooctadiene&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;amino acids through a stereocontrolled synthetic route has been accomplished. The strategy was based on the creation of some novel unsaturated N&#8208;protected cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino esters from 1,3&#8208;cyclooctadiene. Products were subjected to ring&#8208;opening metathesis (ROM) followed by selective ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM). A comparative investigation on the selectivity, regarding the catalysts, yields, conversions, and substrate directing effect on ring&#8208;rearrangement metathesis (RRM) transformation has been accomplished. Importantly, the procedure used in this synthetic process does not affect the configuration of the chiral centers. The pathway takes place across conservation of the configurations of the stereocenters; therefore, the architectural skeleton of the starting cyclooctene&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;amino acids predetermined the structure of the new azaheterocyclic systems.

Herein, we summarized the recent advances of 2&#8208;nitroglycals including its synthetic methods and its applications. Using 2&#8208;nitroglycals, 2&#8208;aminoglycosides, nitro&#8208;polyol derivatives, sugar&#8208;furan derivatives, sugar&#8208;pyrrole molecules, 2,3&#8208;diaminoglycosides and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;dithioglycosides were obtained via Michael&#8211;type addition, retro&#8208;Henry&#8208;type reaction, C1/C3&#8208;Ferrier rearrangement and [3+2] N&#8208;heterocyclic addition. Most of these conversions are achieved via mild organo&#8208;catalysis glycosylation methods.

         <title>Photoinduced Remote Selective C(sp3)&#8208;H Alkylation Mediated by Cesium formate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we developed a photoinduced remote selective C(sp3)&#8722;H alkylation of protected amines in the presence of cesium formate. The protected amines were synthesized from commercially available inexpensive 2&#8208;iodo benzoyl chloride. Under mild reaction conditions, the in situ generated aryl radical is converted to alpha&#8208;amidoalkyl radical via [1,5]&#8208;HAT process, which combines with different Michael acceptors and affords corresponding alkylation products in good yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that formate anion acts as a source of carbon dioxide radical anion (CO2&#8226;&#8722;) and hydrogen atom donor was directly confirmed by isotope&#8208;labeling studies.</dc:description>

         <title>New Avenues for the Synthesis of Oxa&#8208;Cycles Using Lewis/Br&#248;nsted Acid Mediated Carboxygenation and Carboalkoxylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent advancements in organic synthesis have witnessed a remarkable transformation through the functionalization of alkynes. In this review, important developments on the Lewis/Br&#248;nsted acid mediated strategies of 1,1/1,2&#8208;carboxygenation and carboalkoxylation of alkynes for the formation of oxa&#8208;cycles have been highlighted.







Abstract
The cascade functionalizations of alkynes have provided many elegant methods for the synthesis of useful scaffolds. Amongst these functionalizations, the ones comprising C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O bond formation have been utilized extensively due to the abundant presence of oxygenated motifs in various bio&#8208;active natural as well as unnatural products. Transition&#8208;metal catalysis is a mainstay for these tandem functionalizations as they are very efficient. However, their utilization does typically involve stoichiometric additives like other metal salts and/or Lewis acids/Br&#248;nsted acids (LA/BA). Thus, approaches that rely solely on using LA/BA, make these vital transformations not only eco&#8208;friendly and atom economical but also cost beneficial are fast emerging as complementary alternatives. The present review addresses the gap in the literature by summarizing recent developments in LA/BA mediated 1,1/1,2&#8208;carboxygenation and carboalkoxylation of alkynes for the synthesis of oxa&#8208;cycles. The reaction mechanisms are particularly emphasized to bring out understanding needed from the point of future developments in this domain.

         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones with aryl aldehyde without an external photocatalyst was developed. By this protocol, various 3&#8208;acylated quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones were generated under mild conditions in high yields with good functional group compatibility of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and aryl aldehydes. Mechanism studies revealed that the bromide radical (Br&#8901;) and bromomethyl radical (BrCH2&#8901;) generated from the homolytic cleavage of excited&#8208;state CH2Br2 maybe act as the hydrogen abstracting reagent during this process.







Abstract
A simple strategy to 3&#8208;acylated quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones via a photo&#8208;induced cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones with commercially available aldehyde under metal free conditions without an external photocatalyst was developed. In this transformation, various 3&#8208;acylated quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones were generated in high yields with good functional&#8208;group tolerance.

&lt;p&gt;A visible-light-induced cross-dehydrogenative coupling of quinoxalin-2(1H)-ones with aryl aldehyde without an external photocatalyst was developed. By this protocol, various 3-acylated quinoxalin-2(1H)-ones were generated under mild conditions in high yields with good functional group compatibility of quinoxalin-2(1H)-ones and aryl aldehydes. Mechanism studies revealed that the bromide radical (Br&#8901;) and bromomethyl radical (BrCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;) generated from the homolytic cleavage of excited-state CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; maybe act as the hydrogen abstracting reagent during this process.

         <title>Imidazolium Dicyanomethylides as N&#8208;Ylide Precursors of Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazolium&#8208;ylides are conjugated mesomeric betaines with an exocyclic anionic carbon substituent. These ylides were converted by deprotonation into anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, which can be formulated with two negative charges on the carbene carbon atom due to their origin. Subsequent reaction with selenium gave anionic selenourea compounds.







Abstract
In the past, the use of nitrogen ylides focused primarily on cycloadditions, where the 1,3&#8208;dipole was used as a building block for the formation of heterocycles such as pyrroles or pyrrolinones. In this work, we present a new perspective on imidazolium dicyanomethylides with their synthesis and utilization as anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). The values of relative carbene formation energies (CREF) for a wide range of substituted imidazolium ylides unknown in the literature showed promising properties. In situ trapping reactions of these anionic NHCs with selenium led to anionic, water&#8208;soluble compounds that exhibited remarkable coordination behavior according to X&#8208;ray structure analyses. In addition, the 77Se shifts of the investigated compounds were measured to draw conclusions about their &#960;&#8208;acceptance.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Hydroquinone Linked 3,3&#8217;&#8208;Steroid Dimers via a Modified Mitsunobu Protocol</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient one&#8208;step procedure for the synthesis of O,O&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene&#8208;linked saturated steroid dimers through a modified Mitsunobu protocol is described. The formation of hydroquinone dialkyl ethers from secondary alcohols (steroidal or nonsteroidal) requires the use of a three&#8208;component PBu3/TMAD/Et3N system in a non&#8208;polar solvent. This method allows for the synthesis of a wide range of products with potential biological activity.







Abstract
A successful approach for the construction of steroid dimers with a hydroquinone linker under PBu3/TMAD/Et3N/toluene conditions is described. This study provided a new one&#8208;step methodology for the design and synthesis of bis&#8208;steroidal 1,4&#8208;phenylene diethers using mild and effective reagents.

         <title>Towards the Stable Binding of Mercury: Synthesis and Functionalization of Dibenzyldiazabicyclononane Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A universally applicable synthesis route for the preparation of functionalized diazabicyclononane compounds was elaborated starting from a readily available 1,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;3,7&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1] nonan&#8208;9&#8208;ol by alkylation of both secondary amines with modified benzyl residues containing a bromo, trimethylstannyl, trimethylsilyl, and pinacolboranyl residue. High yields (65&#8208;88%) were achieved, supporting the intended purpose of these compounds: efficient mercuration reactions to stably bind Hg2+. Finally, the C&#8208;9 position of two functionalized diazabicyclononanes was further modified by introducing an azide functionality. This enables the conjugation to biomolecules of interest via click chemistry combined with a tracking by the introduced mercury isotopes.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of DNA&#8208;Conjugated Aryl Diazonium Intermediates in DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept article aims to offer a systematic overview of the progression and utilization of DNA&#8208;conjugated diazonium intermediates, thereby contributing to the renewed comprehension of their applications and potential in chemical biology.







Abstract
Aryl diazonium intermediates have emerged as highly versatile intermediates in modern organic synthesis and chemical biology, demonstrating remarkable reactivity under mild reaction conditions. Their significance has extended to DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DELs), where they serve as valuable alternatives to traditional aryl halide&#8208;based cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Aryl diazonium intermediates as N2&#8208;annulation synthons can efficiently transform into benzotriazinone core on DNA besides C&#8722;C coupling. This concept paper illuminates recent advances in this field, emphasizing their applications and potential across various facets of DELs, off&#8208;DNA chemistry, DELs selection, and DNA&#8208;based probes. It is anticipated that these developments will propel the broader utilization of DNA&#8208;conjugated aryl diazonium salt intermediates in DELs, protein labeling, hit discovery, and other interdisciplinary fields.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The construction of bicyclo[1.1.1.]pentanes (BCPs) typically require the cumbersome use of labile [1.1.1.]propellane in solution and involve multicomponent radical reactions, which commonly produce undesired by&#8208;products that hinder the efficient construction of BCPs. In this paper, we present a catalyst&#8208;free strategy by constructing an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex utilizing the naturally electron&#8208;deficient nature of BCP thianthrenium salt, which were irradiated with visible light to obtain trifluoromethyl&#8208;BCP radicals through a SET process, subsequently reacted with various substituted quinoxalines. Moreover, the successful structural modification of drug molecule derivatives confirm&#160;the utility of this scheme in the field of drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically&#8208;Enabled Construction of N&#8208;Acyl Iminophosphoranes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;acyl iminophosphoranes have shown significant potentials in various areas. This paper presents two electrochemical strategies for the successful construction of a series of substituted N&#8208;acyl iminophosphoranes using electrochemical activation of hydroxylamines or dioxazolones to generate unprotected amide radicals and radical anions. The simple undivided cell with inexpensive electrode setups (graphite felts, carbon rods, and copper sheets) provides excellent substrates tolerance under mild conditions. This simple electrochemical construction of N&#8208;acyl iminophosphoranes also has good scalability, practicability and extensibility. Furthermore, synthetic transformations of the N&#8208;acyl iminophosphorane products have demonstrated the application potentials of the P=N bond.</dc:description>

         <title>4&#8208;Methyltetrahydropyran: a Versatile Alternative Solvent for the Preparation of Chiral BINOL Catalysts and the Asymmetric Alkylation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report that the highly hydrophobic ether 4&#8208;MeTHP&#160;constitutes&#160;a promising resource for the development of sustainable synthetic methodologies grounded on the use of organometallic reagents. The beneficial effects of 4&#8208;MeTHP as reaction media&#160;are&#160;illustrated in the organolithium&#8208;promoted anionic&#160;ortho&#8208;Fries rearrangement of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL)&#8208;based carbamates under bench&#8208;type conditions. The use of 4&#8208;MeTHP induces&#160;a remarkable and unexpected stability of the organolithiums species, enabling the efficient preparation of chiral (bis)carboxamide catalysts. Furthermore, superior performances of 4&#8208;MeTHP than other environmentally responsible solvents&#160;are&#160;observed using the synthesized BINOL catalysts in the asymmetric addition of organozinc reagents to aldehydes. Spectroscopic studies in solution suggest that 4&#8208;MeTHP plays a key role in these reactions&#160;by inducing the preferential formation of a reactive monomeric dinuclear complex. This methodology allows for the asymmetric assembly of enantioenriched secondary alcohols in good yields and high&#160;stereoselectivity, working at 0 &#176;C and under air.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dehydrogenation of unactivated alkanes to form versatile alkenes is an important but challenging task in synthetic chemistry. Enabled by a radical&#8208;mediated formyl group migration, a novel visible light&#8208;induced remote desaturation of aldehydes is developed, delivering a panel of trifluoromethylated &#948;,&#949;&#8208; or &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes in moderate to excellent yields with good functional group tolerance at room temperature. Mechanistic studies indicate a reaction pathway comprising the cascade trifluoromethylation of C&#8208;C double bonds, intramolecular addition to aldehydes, &#946;&#8208;fragmentation of alkoxy radicals, single electron transfer oxidation, and deprotonation. It provides a good complementary approach to the existing desaturation protocols.</dc:description>

         <title>Systematic Investigation of Optical and Chiroptical Properties of Chiral &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Oligomers in Solution and Thin Films</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic investigation of four different families of structurally&#8208;related chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated oligomers, prepared by synthetic strategies involving Palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling protocols, was performed in chloroform solution (absorbance, photoluminescence) and spin&#8208;coated thin films (absorbance, photoluminescence, ECD, optical microscopy).







Abstract
Four families of structurally related chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated oligomers bearing a hydroquinone (HQ), 1,5&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene (Naph), benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophene&#8208;4,8&#8208;diol (BDT) or 9H&#8208;carbazole (CBZ) central core, for a total of 11 new compounds, have been synthesized by simple and versatile synthetic strategies involving Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling protocols: a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction, a Sonogashira/desilylation/Sonogashira sequence or a Sonogashira/desilylation/acyl Sonogashira sequence. A systematic investigation of the optical and chiroptical features of the final chiral dyes was performed in chloroform solution and on spin&#8208;coated thin films. The ECD investigation was crucial in revealing that, even within the same family of organic dyes, minor variations in the nature and length of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone can result in very different solid&#8208;state arrangements at different hierarchical scales.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric reaction of 5&#8208;aminopyrazoles with naphthoquinone esters has been established with a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst, providing a wide range of axially chiral naphthylpyrazole derivatives in moderate to excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;% yield) with up to 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee. A preliminary mechanistic investigation was conducted.

A wide range of unprecedented axially chiral naphthylpyrazole derivatives (29&#8197;examples) have been synthesized in moderate to excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;% yield) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee) by utilizing chiral phosphoric acid as a catalyst. This protocol features mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, good scalability and facile derivatization. Moreover, preliminary mechanistic investigation was conducted to elucidate the mechanism.

         <title>Synthesis of 1,4&#8208;Disubstituted and 1&#8208;Substituted &#946;&#8208;Carbolines via 3&#8208;Substituted 2&#8208;Acylindoles</title>

         <dc:description>
Convenient methods are reported for the synthesis of 1,4&#8208;disubstituted and 1&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;carbolines from 3&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;acylindoles, which are accessible through two one&#8208;pot multistep reactions via oxomethylated benzenesulfonamide intermediates. The acylindoles are subsequently subjected to aminomethylenation with formamide derivatives or chemoselective reduction, followed by ring closure with ammonium salts.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Carbolines represent a large class of bioactive natural products, whereby most of these alkaloids bear residues at C1, and occasionally at C3, and only limited examples of 1,4&#8208;disubstituted &#946;&#8208;carbolines are known. In this project we worked out a novel approach to 1,4&#8208;disubstituted &#946;&#8208;carbolines and performed a comprehensive analysis of the scope and limitations of this methodology. The 1,4&#8208;disubstituted &#946;&#8208;carbolines were synthesized via 3&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;acylindoles, for which effective synthesis procedures were developed. Our studies revealed that a broad range of target compounds with electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at C4 are accessible. Limitations of this method arose from competing CH and NH acidities of precursors. Nevertheless, the work described herein provides a unique approach to highly substituted &#946;&#8208;carbolines. In addition, intermediates from this route opened a novel approach to 1&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;carbolines utilizing a chemoselective Mo(CO)6&#8208;catalyzed amide reduction with tetramethyldisiloxane.

         <title>Hypersensitive Inhibition of Organocatalysts by Halide Salts: Are Two Catalysts Involved in the Mannich Reaction?</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Can you kill two catalysts with one chloride? Thiourea/urea catalysts are sensitive to inhibition by chloride salts, but here we find that they appear to be too sensitive. Are two catalysts inhibited by a single chloride ion, or are there two catalysts involved in the reaction? Our kinetic detective story suggests the latter!







Abstract
Conformationally flexible tertiary amine &#8211; thiourea&#8722;urea catalysts 1 and 2 for the Mannich reaction between imines and malonate esters are efficiently inhibited by quaternary ammonium halides. NMR titrations, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and NOE experiments showed that the catalysts bind chloride and bromide ions with relatively high affinities (K=103&#8211;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 in acetonitrile). The halide ions not only block the active site of the catalysts, but they also induce refolding into catalytically inactive conformations upon complexation in an allosteric&#8208;like event. At substoichiometric inhibitor:catalyst ratios, the catalysts displayed hypersensitivity to the inhibitors, with overall rates that were lower than those expected from simple 1st order kinetics and 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inhibitor:catalyst stoichiometry. To rationalize the observed hypersensitivity, different kinetic scenarios were examined. For catalyst 2 and the Takemoto catalyst (6), the data is consistent with 2nd order dependency on catalyst concentration, suggesting that a mechanism involving only a single catalyst in the catalytic cycle is not operative. For catalyst 1, an alternative scenario involving 1st order in catalyst and catalyst poisoning at low concentrations of 1 could also rationalize the hypersensitivity. Interestingly, inhibition of catalysts 1 and 2 by halide salts led to significant loss of enantioselectivity, in contrast to the Takemoto catalyst 6 which was inhibited but with essentially no change in enantioselectivity.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Branch&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Alkylation of Indoles and Azoles with Alkenes: An Additive&#8208; and Solvent&#8208;Free Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward nickel&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the C&#8722;H alkylation of indoles and azoles is disclosed that proceeds under additive&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free conditions. The reaction utilizes readily available alkenes as alkylating partners and delivers Markovnikov products with tolerance of sensitive functionalities.







Abstract
The development of sustainable protocols for the synthesis of alkylated heteroarenes is crucial owing to their widespread existence in medicinally relevant and bioactive natural products. Herein, we describe an efficient, additive&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free approach for the regioselective C&#8722;H alkylation of indoles and azoles with alkenes using a nickel catalyst, which proceeds through a chelation&#8208;assistance strategy. The reaction exclusively provided branched alkylated products with the compatibility of alkyl, alkoxy, fluoro, trifluoromethyl, alkene, cyano, ester, and carbonyl groups. This protocol is applicable to other heteroarenes, such as imidazoles and benzimidazoles, providing the desired alkylated products with exclusive Markovnikov selectivity. The synthetic utility and scale&#8208;up of the reaction are demonstrated, and the protocol is in concord with the principles of green chemistry. Alkylation proceeds through facile and reversible C&#8722;H nickelation and alkene insertion processes, presumably involving rate&#8208;limiting reductive elimination.

&lt;p&gt;The development of sustainable protocols for the synthesis of alkylated heteroarenes is crucial owing to their widespread existence in medicinally relevant and bioactive natural products. Herein, we describe an efficient, additive- and solvent-free approach for the regioselective C&#8722;H alkylation of indoles and azoles with alkenes using a nickel catalyst, which proceeds through a chelation-assistance strategy. The reaction exclusively provided branched alkylated products with the compatibility of alkyl, alkoxy, fluoro, trifluoromethyl, alkene, cyano, ester, and carbonyl groups. This protocol is applicable to other heteroarenes, such as imidazoles and benzimidazoles, providing the desired alkylated products with exclusive Markovnikov selectivity. The synthetic utility and scale-up of the reaction are demonstrated, and the protocol is in concord with the principles of green chemistry. Alkylation proceeds through facile and reversible C&#8722;H nickelation and alkene insertion processes, presumably involving rate-limiting reductive elimination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Potassium tert&#8208;Butoxide&#8208;Promoted Aerobic Dehydrazination of Arylhydrazines: From Arylhydrazines to Substituent Aromatics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficiently aerobic dehydrazination of arylhydrazines promoted by potassium tert&#8208;butoxide (tBuOK) is detailed in this study. This method smoothly produces aromatics analogues from arylhydrazines using catalytic amount of tBuOK under practical conditions, exhibiting excellent functional group tolerance and a broad substrate scope. The application potential of this approach is further demonstrated through the preparation of deuterated, iodinated and brominated aromatics. Moreover, it shows that this aerobic base&#8208;mediated dehydrazination could be utilized to prepare unsymmetrical aryl sulfides, selenides and tellurides with high efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Optical Property Modulation of Substituted [2.2]Paracylophanes through Through&#8208;Space Conjugation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>4,16&#8208;para&#8208;substituted [2.2]paracylophane with naphthalene (PCP&#9148;NAP), anthracene (PCP&#9148;ANTH), and tetraphenylethylene (PCP&#9148;TPE), as new through&#8208;space conjugated dimers, were prepared by the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction of 4,16&#8208;diboryl[2.2]paracyclophane and the corresponding bromo derivative using Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst and KOH as a base. The synthesized compounds were fully characterized by NMR and HR&#8208;MS, and their photophysical and electrochemical properties were studied. The photoluminescence quantum yield of PCP&#9148;NAP, PCP&#9148;ANTH were determined to be 0.21, 0.50 and for PCP&#9148;TPE in aggregated state 0.31, respectively. PCP&#9148;TPE exhibited aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics when the water fraction was greater than 50% in THF/water mixtures. PCP&#9148;ANTH and PCP&#9148;TPE were also characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, and single crystals of PCP&#9148;ANTH were obtained from the centrosymmetric monoclinic space group C2/c. A single crystal of PCP&#9148;TPE crystallizes in the centrosymmetric triclinic space group P&#9148;1, with one molecule residing at the inversion center. The observed properties of these &#960;&#8208;stacked dimers were compared with respect to through&#8208;space conjugation and conjugation length in the structure.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report the construction of C5&#8208;indole unnatural amino acid derivatives via the diastereoselective Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed prochiral &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H arylation of racemic (DL), and enantiopure L&#8208; and D&#8208;carboxamides of amino acids with 5&#8208;iodoindoles. Independently, indole&#8208;based compounds and amino acid motifs are important small molecules in organic synthesis and drug discovery research. This report aimed to contribute to enriching the library of indole&#8208;based unnatural amino acid derivatives. The synthesis of examples of C5&#8208;indole motif&#8208;installed amino acid derivatives comprising norvaline, phenylalanine, leucine, norleucine, 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid having anti&#8208;stereochemistry was accomplished. The synthesis of the C5&#8208;indole motif&#8208;containing non&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid (aminoalkanoic acid) derivatives was also reported. The C&#8208;H arylation reactions of racemic and enantiopure carboxamides with 5&#8208;iodoindoles afforded the corresponding indole unnatural amino acid derivatives with good diastereoselectivity (anti, dr &gt;95:5 and enantiopurity (er up to 99:1). Removal of the directing group (8&#8208;aminoquinoline), phthalimide group and preparation of indole amino acid esters and free amino group&#8208;containing indole unnatural amino acid motifs were also shown. The utility of the methodology was shown by synthesizing indole motif&#8208;containing pyrrolidone and peptide molecules. The stereochemistry of the major (anti) diastereomers was ascertained from the X&#8208;ray structure of a representative compound.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This review aims to highlight the role that computational chemistry has played in advancing the supramolecular chemistry field. We demonstrated recent uses of computational methodologies to elucidate noncovalent interactions in various processes occurring in supramolecular systems. We also emphasized the contributions of these techniques to studying reactions within confined space, showing how computational methodologies help clarify the effects of reactivity and conformational locking. Furthermore, we underscore the utilization of Molecular Dynamics (MD) in elucidating dynamical processes, understanding temperature and pressure effects, and exploring conformational space within supramolecular chemistry. Finally, we highlight the impact that the age of machine learning has on computational chemistry, showing how these universal approximators can enhance existing methods, predict properties, and efficiently explore the chemical space encompassed by these complex systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Copper&#8208;Free Sonogashira Coupling in Water and under Ambient Atmosphere</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sonogashira coupling on aryl bromides can be carried out under micellar conditions, in the absence of copper(I) catalyst, and under ambient atmosphere. Key of the success is the use of Kolliphor EL, a surfactant capable to form oxygen&#8208;free lipophilic domains in water. The method is applied toward the preparation of both (hetero)arylalkynes and luminescent molecular materials.







Abstract
Sonogashira coupling is one of the cornerstone Palladium mediated cross coupling reactions, giving a direct and high yield access to symmetric and non&#8208;symmetric alkynes with high tolerance of substituents. The method generally requires the use of CuI as a cocatalyst, an inert atmosphere to protect palladium catalyst, somewhat harsh conditions like prolonged heating and the use of organic solvents due to the hydrophobicity of reagents and products. Leveraging on the opportunities offered by micellar catalysis, we here present a general methodology to perform Sonogashira coupling in water, with moderate or no heating, under air, without copper co&#8208;catalysts and at very low catalyst loading. The method offers the same generality and scope of organic solvents based couplings, but strongly improves sustainability while offering excellent yields.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of Cyclic Tertiary Alcohols with Lipase A from Candida Antarctica</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing vinyl hexanoate as an acyl donor with Na2CO3 is the key to substantially improving the reaction rate, substrate scope, and product stability in the KR of racemic tertiary alcohols using commercially available lipase A from Candida antarctica. The KR conditions were applied to cyclic tertiary alcohols containing tetralin, dihydroindene, chromane, and thiochromane moieties, yielding esters with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;catalyzed acylative kinetic resolution (KR) and dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic primary and secondary alcohols have been widely reported to produce esters with high enantiomeric purity. In contrast, similar KRs of tertiary alcohols have been reported for only a limited range of substrates and require prolonged reaction times of several days. To gain deeper insight into the substrate scope and increase the process efficiency, we examined the reaction conditions using commercially available immobilized lipase A from Candida antarctica and found that the addition of the heterogeneous, inorganic base sodium carbonate significantly increased the reaction rate while maintaining high enantioselectivity. The use of vinyl hexanoate as the acyl donor provided esters that were stable during chromatography purification. The optimized reaction conditions were then successfully applied to a range of cyclic tertiary alcohols containing tetralin, dihydroindene, chromane, and thiochromane skeletons having, in part, a substituent on the aromatic ring. In this study on the structure&#8211;reactivity relationship of enzymatic KR&#8208;type reactions, we achieved &gt;30&#8201;% conversion for various tertiary alcohols in 24&#8197;h at 25&#8201;&#176;C, producing optically active esters with 88&#8211;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee.

         <dc:description>
A photocatalyzed oxidation of functionalized cyclobutanones to access &#947;&#8208;lactones has been performed in acetonitrile at room temperature, using 9,10&#8208;anthraquinone as catalysts in the presence of TFA. The process furnish good to excellent yields of the desired compounds in 4&#8211;16&#8197;h reaction and after simple filtration of the recyclable catalyst.







Abstract
A photocatalyzed oxidation of functionalized cyclobutanones to access &#947;&#8208;lactones has been performed in acetonitrile at room temperature, using anthraquinone derivatives as catalysts in the presence of TFA. The best reaction results were obtained by using 3&#8197;mol&#8201;% of 9,10&#8208;anthraquinone as a catalyst under 370&#8197;nm irradiation in an O2 environment. The scope and the limitations of this reaction have been investigated using both 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;substituted cyclobutanones, as well as enantiopure ketones, to obtain full preservation of their stereochemical identity after the oxidation. The process furnishes in most cases the desired compounds with high purity after catalyst removal by simple filtration, and reducing the production of solvents waste.

Under strong superacidic conditions and with sufficient time cyclization of two (di)protonated molecules of DAMN is observed, yielding a tetracationic pyrazine species.

         <title>Structural and Electronic Impacts of the Axial Substitution at the Phosphorus Center of C(sp3)&#8208;Bridged P&#8208;Heterotriangulenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematic functionalization of the phosphorus center in the bowl&#8208;shaped dimethylmethylene&#8208;bridged P&#8208;heterotriangulene allowed efficient modulation of its optoelectronic and structural properties. Thorough experimental and theoretical studies revealed the relationship between the s&#8208;character of the P&#8722;X bond and the bowl depth. The compounds form co&#8208;crystals with C60.







Abstract
The structural and electronic properties of the dimethylmethylene&#8208;bridged P&#8208;heterotriangulene have been systematically modulated by functionalization of its phosphorus center. The optoelectronic properties of the obtained derivatives in solution were characterized by UV/Vis absorption and emission spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and 31P NMR spectroscopy. The solid state structures were analyzed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The experimental results were corroborated by density functional theory calculations which revealed the crucial influence of the axial substitution on the bowl&#8208;shaped geometry of the phosphorus&#8208;centered polycyclic scaffold, which is proportional to the s&#8208;character of the P&#8722;X bond. The advantage of the bowl&#8208;shaped P&#8208;heterotriangulene scaffold was demonstrated by successful co&#8208;crystallization with fullerene C60.

         <title>Direct and Stereoselective Protecting&#8208;Group&#8208;Free N&#8208;ADP&#8208;Ribosylation through Traceless Staudinger Ligation</title>

A direct and &#945;&#8208;selective protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free N&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylation through traceless Staudinger ligation is successfully developed. The stereoselectivity of this protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free N&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylation is comfirmed by an enzymatic degradation experiment and HPLC analysis using synthetic standards. This method enables the facile and rapid synthesis of N&#8208;linked ADP&#8208;ribosyl molecules with complete &#945;&#8208;selectivity and moderate yields.







Abstract
Adenine diphosphate (ADP)&#8208;ribosylation catalyzed by bacterial toxins is the addition of an ADP&#8208;ribose moiety to specific amino acid residues in target proteins such as arginine, asparagine, glutamine, and histidine through 1,2&#8208;cis(&#945;)&#8208;glycosidic bond formation. ADP&#8208;ribosylation modifies host cell functions, altering normal cellular processes to facilitate their survival, and replication. Despite the development of click chemistry and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis&#8208;based approaches, the synthesis of structurally well&#8208;defined naturally occurring N&#8208;linked ADP&#8208;ribosyl molecules remains challenging. Herein, we report a direct and &#945;&#8208;selective N&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylation using unprotected &#946;&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosyl azide and triphenylphosphine esters through traceless Staudinger ligation. The stereoselectivity of this protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free N&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylation was validated by enzymatic degradation experiment and high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography, referencing synthetic standards. This method facilitated the facile and rapid synthesis of N&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosyl acetamide, biotin, fluorescent dye, amino acids, and tripeptide with complete &#945;&#8208;selectivity and moderate yields (37&#8211;55&#8201;%).

         <title>Fusion of Cyclohepta[def]fluorene Units: Toward Synthesis of High&#8208;Spin Non&#8208;Benzenoid Nanographenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;benzenoid diradicaloids possessing high&#8208;spin ground states are attractive synthetic targets given their high potential for spintronics and quantum computing. Nevertheless, the synthesis of such compounds remains highly challenging due to their inherent instability. In this work, we present the synthetic attempt towards creating a non&#8208;benzenoid diradicaloid (1) with a triplet ground state by fusing two cyclohepta[def]fluorene units onto a benzene ring. Our synthetic approach involves both oxidation and reduction pathways. In the oxidation path, we obtained the partially dehydrogenated products 1+H and 1+2H containing an indeno[1,2&#8208;b]fluorene core from the tetrahydro precursor (2). However, further dehydrogenation to afford the target molecule (1) did not proceed. On the other hand, with the reduction pathway, a novel tetraketone precursor (9) with two pairs of pentagons and heptagons was successfully synthesized. The subsequent nucleophilic attack however was proved to be difficult probably due to the unselective nucleophilic addition on the zigzag nanographene ketones. Furthermore, UV&#8208;vis absorption, cyclic voltammetry, and theoretical calculations were conducted to explore the optical, electrochemical properties, and aromaticity of all the obtained molecules (1+H, 1+2H and 9). Although the desired target 1 is not achieved, our work provides insight into designing novel high&#8208;spin non&#8208;benzenoid NGs based on nonalternant cyclohepta[def]fluorene system.</dc:description>

         <title>2&#8208;Methylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines (2&#8208;pyNHOs): Highly Nucleophilic Enamines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high reactivity of 2&#8208;methylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines also known as 2&#8208;methylpyridinium derived N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (2&#8208;pyNHOs) has been recognized in organic synthesis, yet a quantification of their nucleophilicity is lacking. Herein we used stopped&#8208;flow photometry to determine the nucleophilicity of a series of 2&#8208;pyNHOs from the kinetics of their reactions with quinone methides and benzhydrylium ions as reference electrophiles in four organic solvents at 20 &#176;C. The kinetic data was evaluated by using the Mayr&#8208;Patz equation, lg k(20 &#176;C) = sN(N + E), which gave nucleophilicity parameters N (and sN). With N in the range of 19.4 to 21.2 (in DMSO), 2&#8208;pyNHOs exceed the reactivity of classical enamines, such as pyrrolidino&#8208;cyclopent&#8208;1&#8208;ene. The addition of 2&#8208;pyNHOs to quinone methides resulted in the formation of zwitterionic adducts with pyridinium and phenolate moieties. Subsequent tautomerization yielded entirely neutral pyridine&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ylidene&#8208;phenol species in several cases. Formation of the zwitterionic adducts from 2&#8208;pyNHOs and neutral electrophiles was almost equally fast in the polar solvents acetonitrile and DMSO, but proceeded one to two orders of magnitude slower in the less polar solvents dichloromethane or THF.</dc:description>

         <title>The Environmental Pollutant NO3&#8226; Rapidly Damages Alkene Moieties in Lipids Through Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The presence of alkene moieties in fatty acids of (phospho)lipids and cholesterol derivatives makes them highly susceptible to damage by nitrate radicals (NO3&#8226;), potentially formed through simultaneous exposure to the environmental air pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO2&#8226;) and ozone (O3). Absolute rate coefficients derived from reactions with simplified model systems range from 4 to 8 &#215; 109 M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in acetonitrile, ranking among the highest determined for NO3&#8226; reactions with biomolecules in solution to date. Alkenes featuring an electron&#8208;withdrawing carbonyl substituent also display notable reactivity with k values of (2.5 &#177; 1.0) &#215; 108 M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Calculations suggest that these reactions are initiated by oxidative electron transfer (ET) involving the C=C bond, followed by recombination of the resulting alkene radical cation with nitrate anion (NO3&#8722;) to form the nitrate adduct radical as the kinetically controlled product. Conversely, saturated fatty acid derivatives and cholestanol react with NO3&#8226; through hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with rate coefficients of 106 &#8211; 107 M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, indicating that biomolecules with a considerable number of non&#8208; or moderately activated sp3 C&#8211;H bonds are also highly susceptible to NO3&#8226; attack. These findings underscore the potential health hazards associated with exposure to combined NO2&#8226; and O3 gases.</dc:description>

         <title>Atropisomeric Properties of 5N&#8208;Benzoyl&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzodiazepin&#8208;2&#8208;ones: Substituent Effects on Rotation around the Ar&#8211;N(CO) Axis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>5N&#8208;Benzoyl&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzodiazepin&#8208;2&#8208;ones with various substituents were synthesized and their atropisomeric properties were analyzed. For the rotational isomers (E/Z) based on the amide bond [N&#8213;C(=O)], the E&#8208;isomers were preferentially formed regardless of the substituents. Atropisomers (aR/aS) due to the Ar&#8213;N(CO) (sp2&#8213;sp2) axis were isolated using chiral HPLC, and the rotational barrier (&#916;G&#8225;) in thermal isomerization was measured. The rotation barrier about the Ar&#8213;N(CO) axis was affected by both the substituents at the C6&#8208;position and the p&#8208;substituents on the benzoyl group. The substituents at C6 (R1) caused both steric and electronic effects. On the other hand, the p&#8208;substituents (R2) on the benzoyl group caused electronic effects: the electron&#8208;donating group (EDG) lowered the &#916;G&#8225; value, whereas the electron&#8208;withdrawing group (EWG) raised it. The &#916;G&#8225; values were linearly correlated with the magnitude of the electronic effect (Hammett &#963; constants) of functional groups (R2). The EDG causes an increase in the electron density on the carbonyl moiety in the amide, which may disturb the planarity of the amide bond, resulting in a decrease in the &#916;G&#8225; value.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Tether Length on endo/exo Stereoselectivity in Alkene&#8211;Arene meta&#8208;Photocycloaddition Reactions towards the Aphidocolin/Stemodin Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intramolecular alkene&#8208;arene meta&#8208;photocycloadditions are powerful transformations that use the enhanced reactivity of photoexcited benzene rings to facilitate addition of an alkene 1,3 across donor groups and form complex three&#8208;dimensional fused&#8208;ring systems from readily accessible starting materials. Intramolecular examples have traditionally been restricted to 3&#8208;membered tethers, with cycloaddition resulting from exo&#8208;conformation. However, by judicious tether design we have demonstrated that a 4&#8208;membered tether can also proceed in good yield; interestingly, via an endo&#8208;exciplex (1.2:1) enabling access to both natural product skeletons and interesting scaffolds for medicinal chemistry research.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Optical and Theoretical Characterization of Imidazo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines and Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines emit intense blue luminescence, suggesting their possible use as emitter molecules in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. We synthesized several new imidazo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines and found they possessed a characteristic hypsochromic effect and even increased quantum efficiency compared to the homolog imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines, as measured by UV&#8208;vis&#8208; and fluorescence spectroscopy in solution. The energies of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals were calculated using density functional theory and experimentally determined by cyclic voltammetry in solution. We obtained a maximum fluorescence quantum yield of 48% at 446 nm for the newly synthesized 3&#8208;(4&#8208;cyanophenyl)&#8208;1&#8208;(pyridyl)imidazo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline with an optimized substitution pattern. For 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridinyl)imidazo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline, a quantum yield of 33% was obtained at an even shorter emission wavelength of 431 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Diarylindanones and 2&#8208;Arylindenes from Trisubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Esters Derived from Highly Strained 2,3&#8208;Diarylcyclopropenones and Coumarin Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel strategy has been developed for the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;diarylindanones and 2&#8208;arylindenes through the formation of trisubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters by the ring opening of 2,3&#8208;diarylcyclopropenones in the presence ofa catalytic amount of TPP under mild reaction conditions. Initially, PPh3 activates the diarylcyclopropenone to generate the phosphonium adduct, which simultaneously reacts with 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins to afford the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters instead of Wittig olefination. Subsequently, these &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters undergo a smooth Friedel&#8208;Crafts type cyclization with arenes in the presence of AlCl3 to give a new series of 2,3&#8208;diarylindanones in good to excellent yields. Additionally, the reduction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters with NaBH4 followed by the acid catalyzed cyclization of resulting allylic alcohols afforded the 2&#8208;arylindenes in good yields. This is the first report on the use of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters as precursors for diarylindanones and arylindenes synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Topological Structural Chemistry of Fused Bicycloalkanes Allowing Homeomorphic Conversions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fused bicycloalkanes have&#160;several structures with different orientation of the substituents, such as out,out&#8208;, in,in, and in,out&#8208;structures. Some bicycloalkanes can undergo homeomorphic conversion between certain structures, for instance an out,out&#8208;structure convert to an in,in&#8208;structure. This homeomorphism can be achieved by one chain passing through the macroring. In this report, topological structural chemistry of fused bicycloalkanes and their analogues allowing homeomorphic conversions were&#160;reviewed. Although the concept of homeomorphism in fused bicycloalkanes was proposed 50 years ago, comprehensive researches on their structural chemistry are still ongoing. These understandings are highly relevant to the fundamentals of many fields of chemistry, including structural chemistry, theoretical chemistry, natural products chemistry, and materials science.</dc:description>

         <title>Multicomponent Tandem Cyclization/Aromatization Reaction: Access to 2&#8208;Substituted Naphthothiazoles and Benzothiazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A straightforward, metal&#8208;free multicomponent tandem cyclization/aromatization approach for the synthesis of naphthothiazoles and benzothiazoles has been described. This method employs &#945;&#8208;tetralone and cyclohexenones as the starting materials, styrene derivatives as a one&#8208;carbon synthon, ammonium salt as the N source, elemental sulfur as the S source, and an oxidant. This approach offers a broad substrate scope, including &#945;&#8208;tetralone and cyclohexenones adorned with different functional groups, resulting in moderate to high yields of the desired products.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Access to Tetrasubstituted N&#8208;H Pyrroles by Catalytic 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of Azomethine Ylides and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Ynones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient synthetic strategies for the preparation of tetrasubstituted N&#8208;H pyrrole derivatives, especially in an environmentally benign fashion, still remains momentous, yet challenging. Herein, we report a Cu(II)&#8208;catalyzed tandem reaction of 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;ynones and glycine iminoesters, followed by&#160;Cu(II)&#8208;promoted oxidative (air) dehydrogenative aromatization, allowing de novo access to tetrasubstituted N&#8208;H pyrroles in up to 81% yield under green reaction conditions. The possible reaction pathway is tentatively proposed. Finally, fully substituted pyrroles can be available via N&#8208;alkylation, and the preliminary phase&#8208;transfer catalytic asymmetric N&#8208;alkylation is also studied to give an axially chiral pyrrole.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Regioselective Synthesis of Bio&#8208;Based Hydroxyurethanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New furan, carvone and limonene&#8208;based carbamates have been synthesized with high regioselectivity under solvent&#8208;free and mild reaction conditions. Moreover, a detailed study on the reaction conditions allowed for the drastic reduction of the TBD loading with almost no effect on the regioselectivity.







Abstract
The regioselective synthesis of carbamates from bio&#8208;derived cyclic carbonates and amines by using 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD) as an organocatalyst is reported. This methodology led to the preparation of a wide range of bio&#8208;sourced hydroxyurethanes from furan&#8208;, carvone&#8208; and limonene&#8208;based scaffolds under solvent&#8208;free and mild reaction conditions. Moreover, a comprehensive analysis of the process allowed us to optimize the catalyst loading with little or no impact on the process regioselectivity.

         <title>Synthesis of a Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane&#8208;Containing Aromatic Lipoxin B4 Analogue and Heteroaromatic Congeners</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the asymmetric synthesis of an aromatic analogue of lipoxin B4 containing a conformationally rigid and potentially more metabolically resistant bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) ring incorporated into the upper alkyl chain. This was achieved via the design of a key BCP&#8208;containing fragment that could be used as a common intermediate in the synthesis of the target analogue as well as other heteroaromatic congeners.







Abstract
Lipoxins are pro&#8208;resolving mediators that play an important role in the resolution phase of the innate inflammatory response. However, because of their chemical and metabolic instability, the design of more stable synthetic analogues of lipoxin A4 and lipoxin B4 is an ongoing area of study. Herein we report the asymmetric synthesis of an aromatic lipoxin B4 analogue containing a conformationally rigid and potentially more metabolically resistant bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) ring incorporated into the upper alkyl chain. This was achieved by the development of a 9&#8208;step chiral&#8208;pool synthesis of a novel BCP&#8208;containing boronic ester coupling partner which could serve as a common precursor to the target analogue as well as other analogues with further modifications to the aromatic core.

         <title>Dielectrophilic Approach to Sequential Heterofunctionalization of Ethylene from Vinylthianthrenium Salt</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vinylthianthrenium salt was employed as the starting material for a formal difunctionalization of ethylene. Its 1,2&#8208;dielectrophilic property enables the sequential incorporation of two distinct nucleophiles onto ethylene. Through this method, we achieve the formation of a C&#8722;C bond and a C&#8722;X bond (X=N, O, halogen) on ethylene, in a single step performed under mild conditions.







Abstract
Vinyl thianthrenium salt is a compound with interesting electrophilic properties capable of reacting with two distinct nucleophiles. By using &#946;&#8208;keto esters as one of the reaction partners, it is possible to insert a chain of two carbon atoms with a further functionalization under mild conditions. We have studied this new methodology which involves the stepwise formation of a C&#8722;C and a C&#8722;X bond (with X=N, O, etc.) in one step without the use of metals. Depending on the reaction conditions and the starting ketoester, a varied reactivity has been observed and described.

         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated radical heteroarylation of 2&#8209;mercaptothiazolinium salts with N&#8208;heteroarenes is reported, furnishing the corresponding functionalized N&#8208;heteroarenes in good to high yields. Various alkyl bromides were converted conveniently into redox&#8208;active thiazolinium salts and subsequently into alkyl radicals by reaction with an excited&#8208;state photocatalyst. This mild protocol permits efficient functionalization of various N&#8208;heteroarenes with a wild range of cyclic and acyclic primary and secondary alkyl groups.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Polyol esters are abundant bio&#8208;based resources. Integration of polyol esters into the production chain of fine chemicals would reduce carbon emission and improve the sustainability of the chemical industry. An efficient synthetic route towards phenoxyethanols was developed through catalytic hydroxyethylation of phenols with ethylene glycol diacetate as the reagent. This method showed the potential of ethylene glycol diester as a safe and sustainable substitute for ethylene oxide, a useful but toxic reagent. A variety of phenoxyethanol esters were produced in high yield under simple catalytic conditions. Mechanism studies revealed the reaction underwent a neighboring group participation process.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Aza&#8208;Bicyclic Maleimide Skeleton by Addition&#8208;Ring Opening Cascade Reaction of Vinylogous Oxindole</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method has been developed to achieve for addition&#8208;ring opening cascade reaction, according a series of aza&#8208;bicyclic maleimide derivatives with good yields and diastereoselectivities.







Abstract
An efficient method has been developed to facilitate the addition&#8208;ring opening cascade reaction of vinylogous oxindole, resulting in the synthesis of a variety of aza&#8208;bicyclic maleimide derivatives with high yields and exceptional diastereoselectivities. Furthermore, the product could be effectively and easily transformed into the difluoromethylenecyclohexane skeleton through a dehydrofluorination process. This methodology demonstrates significant potential for the synthesis of aza&#8208;bicyclic maleimide skeleton, which possesses biological or pharmaceutical activity.

         <title>Heteroaryl 2&#8208;Sulfonamide Synthesis by SN2 Reaction&#8211;Oxidation Cascade</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient SN2&#8208;oxidation cascade reaction for synthesizing heteroaryl 2&#8208;sulfonamides from disulfanes and amines is described. The methodology has broad scope, affording heteroaryl 2&#8208;sulfonamides in moderate to good yields, and was applied to the synthesis of H3B&#8208;968, a potential Werner Syndrome Protein (WRN) small molecule inhibitor.







Abstract
Heteroaryl 2&#8208;sulfonamides are an important structural moiety in drug discovery. However, reports of the efficient synthesis of these scaffolds are rare. Herein we disclose new reaction conditions to synthesize heteroaryl 2&#8208;sulfonamides from disulfanes and amines through an SN2&#8208;oxidation cascade. The approach is compatible with a wide variety of heteroaryl and amine substrates and can be conducted on a gram scale. A potential Werner Syndrome Protein (WRN) small molecule inhibitor H3B&#8208;968 was also synthesized by this method.

         <title>Polymorphism and White Light Emission of 1&#8208;Bromo&#8208;3,5,7&#8208;triphenyladamantane Compared with 1,3,5,7&#8208;Tetraphenyladamantane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted diamondoid polymorphs were identified and show different white&#8208;light emission spectra upon continuous infrared laser irradiation. The polymorphicity arises from a competition of London dispersion interactions either as short CH&#8211;&#960; or Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br contacts.







Abstract
Here we report our investigation of 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,5,7&#8208;triphenyladamantane (1) and the elucidation of polymorphic crystals (1&#8201;A and 1&#8201;B) using single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. In the monoclinic crystal system of 1&#8201;A (P21/n), we observed CH&#8211;&#960; interactions, while Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br interactions are absent. Conversely, the Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br interactions are an apparent factor in the formation of the monoclinic crystal system of 1&#8201;B (R
). We compare our findings with 1,3,5,7&#8208;tetraphenyladamantane (2), characterized by numerous CH&#8211;&#960; interactions in the solid. Computational analyses were employed to investigate the interactions within the characteristic dimers present in the unit cells of 1&#8201;A and 1&#8201;B, including visualization of noncovalent interactions and the use of the atoms&#8208;in&#8208;molecules approach as well as MO analyses. These support the notion of London dispersion (LD) dimer&#8208;dimer interactions in 1&#8201;A between the phenyl moieties, whereas 1&#8201;B exhibits additional dimer&#8208;dimer Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br contacts. In contrast, the crystals of 2 are exclusively held together by CH&#8211;&#960; stacking LD interactions, a feature absent in the polymorphs of 1. Both polymorphic forms of 1 emit white light when subjected to 900&#8197;nm continuous wave laser irradiation, displaying a subtle blue shift compared to 2. The absence of CH&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions between the dimers of 1 causes a small red&#8208;shift in the emission spectrum.

         <title>Effects of a Larger N&#8208;Heterocyclic Ring in Rofecoxib Analogues on AIE Activity and Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two AIE&#8208;active analogues, 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF and 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF, with different N&#8208;heterocyclic rings were synthesized. Compound 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF with a larger N&#8208;heterocyclic ring showed an increase in the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) by a factor of around 10 in the solid as well as more multifunctional applications, such as mechanochromism, acidochromism, and lipid droplets imaging ability.







Abstract
Two analogues of rofecoxib, 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF and 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF, were designed according to the strategy of heterocyclic ring enlargement and facilely synthesized in a facile manner by Knoevenagel reactions. The first compound, 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF, had low quantum yields (QY) of 3.0&#8201;% in the solid states. After replacing the pyrrolidinyl with piperidinyl, the resulting 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF had a significantly increased QY, with a value of 28&#8201;%. The root&#8208;mean&#8208;square deviation (RMSD) values between S0 and S1 of 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF and 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF in tetrahydrofuran were 0.51, 0.35&#8197;&#197;, respectively. As compared with 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF, compound 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF exhibited a smaller RMSD, which indicated a lower non&#8208;radiative transition rate. A single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study and Hirshfeld surfaces analysis revealed that 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF had a more nonplanar molecule structure and a weaker &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction, which might result in a higher fluorescence intensity and QY. Owing to its better aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior, compound 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF showed more multi&#8208;functional applications, including mechanochromism, acidochromism, and lipid droplets imaging ability. These results imply that the strategy of heterocyclic ring enlargement provides a new paradigm for the design of new luminogens with AIE properties.

         <title>Exploring the Reactivity of Melanins as Photocatalysts for Reductive Dehalogenations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reductive dehalogenation of &#945;&#8208;halogenated carbonyl compounds has been performed by exploiting four different melanin polymers in the role of photocatalyst. The reaction smoothly took place under visible light irradiation in the presence of sodium ascorbate as an additive. The melanin obtained from 5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole 2&#8208;carboxylic acid offered the best performance, especially in the reduction of brominated substrates.







Abstract
Four melanin polymers prepared from different precursors (5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole, 5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole 2&#8208;carboxylic acid, 1,8&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene and dopamine) have been adopted as photocatalysts in the reductive dehalogenation of a series of model &#945;&#8208;halogen carbonyl derivatives. The best performing melanin was that obtained from 5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole 2&#8208;carboxylic acid, which allowed to dehalogenate efficiently both bromomalonate esters and phenacyl bromide; on the other hand, chloromalonate esters were almost unreactive under the same reaction conditions. Electrochemical and control experiments enabled to elucidate the reaction mechanism, demonstrating the key role of electrons as charge carriers in the observed photocatalytic process.

         <title>Halogen Promoted Desulfurative Cleavage of Cyclopropylmethyl Thioethers and Amination of the Formed Cyclopropylcarbinyl Cations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclopropylmethyl sulfides react with N&#8208;fluorosulfonimide (NFSI) or molecular iodine, enabling C&#8722;S cleavage to generate cyclopropylcarbinyl cations, which evolve through cyclopropane ring&#8208;opening reactions into homoallyl cations suitable to react with nucleophiles present in the reaction media. This desulfurative cleavage of cyclopropylmethyl thioethers under non&#8208;acidic conditions facilitates homoallylation of N&#8208;based nucleophiles such as alkyl or aryl amines as well as sulfonimides through a one&#8208;pot protocol in one or two steps depending of the nucleophile.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Synthesis Applied to Optoelectronic and Energy Materials: Design, Applications and Limitations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic Covalent Chemistry can bring together simple components to create complex self&#8208;assembled materials. This strategy is so far under&#8208;investigated in the field of optoelectronic and energy materials. However, it has the potential to rapidly produce self&#8208;assembled organic semiconductors or stimuli responsive devices. Herein, we highlight the advantages of the dynamic covalent approaches and their limitations when applied to this field.







Abstract
Dynamic Covalent Chemistry, consisting in the use of dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) to create complex objects by working at the thermodynamic equilibrium, has undeniable advantages for the preparation of conjugated systems with tailored optoelectronic properties for organic electronics. Chemists can combine simple building blocks with simple functional groups of appropriate geometry, structure and stoichiometry to build multidimensional conjugated architectures. Dynamic covalent reactions are often precious metal&#8208;free, generate little to no side products and are very efficient. DCBs however afford sensitive materials, and consequently a balance needs to be found between the ease of synthesis, the stability and the performances. The dynamicity of the target materials hence can considerably reduce their applicability in organic electronics where strongly stable materials are needed, but opens the door to stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviour and recyclability. A way to overcome dynamicity issues is to lock DCBs, but often at the cost of decreased conjugation. In this review, we will highlight how DCBs are employed to prepare functional optoelectronically active materials, such as discrete molecules, polymers or covalent organic frameworks, applied in fields ranging from organic light&#8208;emitting diodes and solar cells to organic batteries and transistors. We will also discuss their limitations, benefits and the current challenges to overcome.

         <title>Double Winding Vine&#8208;Shaped Biphenyl with Molecular Asymmetry. Synthesis, Structure, and Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biphenyl strapped by two chains between benzene rings gives a double winding vine&#8208;shaped structure suggesting a new class of molecular asymmetry, in which enantioinversion hardly occurs.







Abstract
A biphenyl derivative in which two benzene rings are strapped with two chains is prepared. The synthesized product shows molecular asymmetry, which was confirmed by HPLC analysis with chiral column and named as winding vine&#8208;shaped biphenyl. The synthesis of such vine shaped molecule was performed by ring&#8208;closing metathesis or alternatively by annulation with nosylated ethylenediamine. The structure of the obtained product was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis.

     alt="Double Winding Vine-Shaped Biphenyl with Molecular Asymmetry. Synthesis, Structure, and Properties"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biphenyl strapped by two chains between benzene rings gives a double winding vine-shaped structure suggesting a new class of molecular asymmetry, in which enantioinversion hardly occurs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A biphenyl derivative in which two benzene rings are strapped with two chains is prepared. The synthesized product shows molecular asymmetry, which was confirmed by HPLC analysis with chiral column and named as winding vine-shaped biphenyl. The synthesis of such vine shaped molecule was performed by ring-closing metathesis or alternatively by annulation with nosylated ethylenediamine. The structure of the obtained product was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. The absolute configuration of the molecular asymmetry was assigned after leading to the corresponding camphor sulfonamide through denosylation and re-amidation process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A ChemoEnzymatic Approach for the Preparation of &#8220;Linear&#8208;Shaped&#8221; Diaryl Pyrazines as Potential Antiprotozoal Agents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from simple, commercially available aromatic aldehydes, &#8220;linear&#8208;shaped&#8221; diaryl pyrazines were prepared by a novel chemoenzymatic route comprising a biocatalyzed benzoin condensation reaction and a transaminase&#8208;mediated tandem process of transamination and cyclization. The obtained pyrazines were tested for their potential leishmanicidal and antiplasmodial activity in&#8197;vitro.







Abstract
Nitrogenous heterocyclic rings are present in a wide range of drugs, natural compounds, and fine chemicals and are considered privileged scaffolds in medicinal chemistry. Seeking novel anti&#8208;protozoal drugs acting on new targets or by novel mechanisms of action, we focused on a preliminary evaluation of the potential of &#8220;linear&#8208;shaped&#8221; diaryl pyrazines. To this purpose, a two&#8208;enzyme chemoenzymatic synthesis of this heteroaromatic core was carried out. Specifically, starting from simple, commercially available aromatic aldehydes, the target pyrazines were obtained through a sequence of biocatalytic benzoin condensation, chemical oxidation and a transaminase&#8208;mediated tandem process of transamination and cyclization. The profiles of the compounds as antiprotozoal agents were evaluated in&#8197;vitro against parasites cultures of the Leishmania and Plasmodium genera and using the human cell line HepG2.

         <title>[N&#8722;I&#8722;N] Type Halogen Bonding: Structure, Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[N&#8722;I&#8722;N] type halogen bonds have gradually attracted much attention. This concept summarizes the structure, classification, synthesis, and application of [N&#8722;I&#8722;N] type halogen bonds. The challenges in this field were identified and its development prospects are also discussed.







Abstract
Halogen bond has received widespread attention in recent years due to the vast applications in supramolecular chemistry, sensing and crystal engineering. In contrast to the normal halogen bonds, [N&#8722;I&#8722;N] type halogen bond exhibits enhanced strength and solvent resistance capabilities. It adopts a bonding geometry of the three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron bond, where the nitrogen can be a neutral, positive, or negative species such as pyridine, saccharin, and urotropine moieties. The emerging new type halogen bond has found specific potentials in constructing supramolecular architectures and catalysis. This concept provides a brief summary based on recent developments of [N&#8722;I&#8722;N] type halogen bonding, reviewing and summarizing its synthesis, structure and application.
