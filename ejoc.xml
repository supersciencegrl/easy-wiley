         <title>Organocatalytic Asymmetric Cyclization Reactions with &#947;&#8208;Hydroxyenones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of recent advancements in &#947;&#8208;hydroxyenone&#8208;based organocatalytic asymmetric cyclization techniques is given in this review paper. Because &#947;&#8208;hydroxyenones are bifunctional, they are an effective building block for creating oxa&#8208;heterocycles.

This review article provides an overview of the recent developments in organocatalytic asymmetric cyclization strategies utilizing &#947;&#8208;hydroxyenones.&#8201; Due to the bifunctional nature of &#947;&#8208;hydroxyenones, it is a powerful building block for synthesizing oxygen&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. The cyclization strategies are systematically categorized based on the nature of the organocatalysts employed: (i) chiral prolinol analogs, which obtain tetrahydrofuran&#8208;fused 3,4&#8208;dihydrocoumarins and 2,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted tetrahydrofurans; (ii) chiral bifunctional squaramides, affording diverse spirocyclic frameworks such as spiro&#8208;tetrahydrofuran&#8208;pyrazolones, morpholinones, and oxindole&#8208;derived systems; (iii) chiral bifunctional thioureas, which forms 1,3&#8208;dioxolanes, oxazolidines, and cyclic acetals; (iv) multifunctional modular organocatalysts, affording enantioenriched &#945;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones; and (v) other chiral organocatalysts which cannot be grouped in previous categories such as Song's chiral oligoethylene glycol as a cation&#8208;binding catalyst leads to the generation of chiral 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazinanes.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of 10&#8208;Aryl&#8208;11H&#8208;indeno[2,1&#8208;a]azulenes and Azuleno[2,1&#8208;a]indenones</title>

         <dc:description>
A cycloaddition strategy for the synthesis of 10&#8208;aryl&#8208;11H&#8208;indeno[2,1&#8208;a]azulenes, as well as their derivatives, is presented. The work highlights improve reactivity using enamines from 1&#8208;indanone and pyrrolidine, followed by electrophilic chlorination and oxidation. Structural, optical, and electrochemical investigations elucidate unique properties, offering promising applications in organic electronic and photonic devices.

An efficient synthesis of 10&#8208;aryl&#8208;11H&#8208;indeno[2,1&#8208;a]azulenes has achieved via [8&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition between 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;cyclohepta[b]furan&#8208;2&#8208;ones with an enamine is generated from 1&#8208;indanone and pyrrolidine in good yields. Oxidation of 10&#8208;aryl&#8208;11H&#8208;indeno[2,1&#8208;a]azulenes with 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;p&#8208;benzoquinone in aqueous acetone shows complete decomposition, whereas chlorinated derivatives undergoes the oxidation to afford the corresponding azuleno[2,1&#8208;a]indenones in moderate to good yields. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals that the 11H&#8208;indeno[2,1&#8208;a]azulene and azuleno[2,1&#8208;a]indenone cores are remarkably planar, while the appended aryl groups adopt a nearly orthogonal orientation owing to steric hindrance, thereby limiting conjugative interactions. Ultraviolet&#8208;visible and fluorescence spectroscopic investigations, supported by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations, indicated that the optical transitions are predominantly localized on the azulene unit and are subtly modulated by the electronic nature of the aryl substituents. In addition, electrochemical studies also demonstrate systematic variations in redox potentials according to the electronic characteristics of the aryl groups.

         <title>Multigram Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation of Functionalized Terminal Alkynes with B2Pin2</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Application of cheap and accessible reactants for copper&#8208;mediated borylation of functionalized terminal alkynes is described. Based on the thorough assessment of different ligands/additives for various types of substrates, a simple decision tree for the optimal reaction condition choice is proposed. Using the developed methodology, a series of synthetically valuable alkenyl boronates is prepared on 10&#8211;300&#8201;g scale in single run.

A comprehensive study of the commercially available ligands/additives in the formal copper&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration reaction of functionalized terminal alkynes is described. Based on the common reaction system (CuCl&#8211;B2Pin2), a set of common and inexpensive ligands or additives&#8212;namely, rac&#8208;BINAP, PPh3, [(t&#8208;Bu)3PH]BF4, and LiCl&#8212;is tested for its effects on the borylation regioselectivity and overall reaction efficiency. The results observed demonstrate correlation between the substrate nature (propargylic, homopropargylic, or higher homolog) and the ligand, which can be used for the preferential preparation of linear or branched isomer of the target alkenyl boronic species. It is found that LiCl and (t&#8208;Bu)3P can be used for preparation of &#946;&#8208;substituted alkenyl boronates, whereas &#945;&#8208;substituted isomers are preferentially obtained in the presence of triarylphopsphine ligands. The scope of the transformations covers derivatives of protected (homo)propargylic alcohols and amines and tolerated free alcohol, ether, silyl ether, ketal, ester, and alkene moieties. The practical utility of the discussed methodologies is proven by the multigram preparation of target building blocks (10&#8230;100&#8201;g for over 20 boronates, up to 300&#8201;g&#8212;for a few selected representatives).

         <title>Copper Coils as Efficient and Inexpensive Reactors for the Synthesis of Tetrazoles in Flow Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;coil reactors are used for the synthesis of tetrazoles starting from benzonitriles in continuous flow. The reaction is carried out at high temperatures and residence times, in the presence of sodium azide, making the flow chemistry approach safer than the batch alternatives. Several tetrazoles have been prepared, including a key precursor of sartan drugs.

Sartans are an important family of drugs used to treat hypertension. A common characteristic of most of them is a biphenyl moiety with a tetrazole ring in the ortho position of the phenyl&#8211;phenyl bond. This tetrazole is typically synthesized from the respective nitriles through a [3&#8201;+&#8201;2] azide&#8208;nitrile cycloaddition. However, the use of large amounts of azides at high temperatures for extended periods of time is inherently concerning, as serious accidents can occur if safety protocols are not thoroughly developed and implemented. The implementation of these procedures in continuous flow would therefore be beneficial from the safety perspective. In this article, a method is presented for the preparation of tetrazoles from the respective nitriles employing a copper coil as reactor and catalyst. The reaction parameters have been studied and optimized to maximize conversion. A variety of benzonitriles with different ring substituents have been transformed in moderate to good yields and copper leaching has been analyzed, showing that the copper leached is enough to catalyze this reaction. More interestingly, the method has been applied to obtain the tetrazole ring present in a key intermediate used in sartan manufacturing, a highly sterically hindered compound.

         <title>Substrate Divergent 4&#960;/6&#960; Electrocyclization of CF3&#8208;Quinolone Heterodendralenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A substrate&#8208;dependent 4&#960;/6&#960; electrocyclization of in&#8201;situ generated CF3&#8208;heterodendralenes from 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;trifluoroacetyl quinolones is described. Phenyl substitution favors 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization to give CF3&#8208;substituted cyclobuta[c]quinolones bearing a CF3&#8208;containing quaternary center, while vinyl substitution promotes 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization to yield CF3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;phenanthridones.

Herein, a substrate&#8208;divergent 4&#960;/6&#960; electrocyclization of hitherto unknown CF3&#8208;heterodendralenes is disclosed, generated in&#8201;situ from the 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;trifluoroacetyl quinolones. The reaction favors 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization in the presence of a phenyl substituent, producing cyclobuta[c]quinolones featuring a challenging CF3&#8208;all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter. Conversely, vinyl substitution promotes 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization to provide CF3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;phenanthridones.

         <title>Cellulose&#8208;Based Nanosponges Loaded with Palladium as Efficient Heterogeneous Catalysts for the Synthesis of Challenging Derivatives with Pharmaceutical Relevance</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a cellulose&#8208;based heterogeneous palladium catalyst (CNS&#8208;Pd) for the efficient and selective Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant heterocyclic derivatives, including scaffolds derived from unstable boronic molecules. The study emphasizes the use of mild conditions, high yields, and reduced palladium leaching, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional homogeneous systems in complex molecule synthesis.

Developing efficient catalytic systems is crucial for synthesizing complex heterocyclic compounds used in pharmaceuticals. However, key motifs, like pyridine and furan derivatives, pose challenges due to regioselectivity and sensitivity to harsh conditions. Conventional homogeneous palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, while effective, suffer from catalyst recovery issues, palladium contamination, and environmental concerns. To overcome these limitations, this study explores cellulose&#8208;based nanosponges as sustainable palladium supports for heterogeneous catalysis, enhancing stability and green chemistry integration. These nanostructured materials, synthesized from cellulose, provide a high&#8208;surface&#8208;area scaffold that enhances uniform palladium dispersion, with a 22% w/w overall loading measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, and prevents metal leaching, integrating green chemistry principles and a safe&#8208;and&#8208;sustainable&#8208;by&#8208;design approach. In this work, the optimization of Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura couplings using CNS&#8208;Pd under mild conditions, showcasing the efficiency and selectivity of this heterogeneous catalyst in the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant heterocyclic derivatives, is presented. Notably, high reaction yields (65%&#8211;99%) even with unstable boronic derivatives are achieved, which are typically synthesized using homogeneous catalysts, often with poor yields, selectivity and purity of the final products. The obtained results underscore the potential of biopolymer&#8208;based catalysts to drive innovation in sustainable pharmaceutical synthesis, effectively bridging the gap between heterogeneous catalysis and pharmaceutical chemistry.

         <title>Efficient Hydrosilylation Reaction of Olefins Catalyzed by a Dinuclear Ruthenium Complex</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under mild reaction conditions, the dinuclear ruthenium catalyst is used to achieve an anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrosilylation reaction of olefins. Notably, the reaction is extremely selective and no alkenylsilanes, olefin reduction products, or isomerization products are detected in this reaction.

Dinuclear metal synergistic catalysis is presented as a strategy for the hydrosilylation of olefins. Both aliphatic and aromatic olefins smoothly undergo anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrosilylation under mild reaction conditions to produce the corresponding organosilicon products in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields (42&#8211;96%) with high selectivity. The formation of alkenylsilanes, olefin reduction products, and isomerization products is not observed. Synthetically valuable functional groups such as chloro atom, methoxycarbonyl, and ester are tolerated well under the current reaction conditions. Control experiments and mechanistic studies suggest a synergistic catalytic mechanism involving bimetallic cooperation.

         <title>Molecular Iodine&#8208;Mediated Functionalization of &#945;&#8208;Carbonyl Sulfoxonium Ylides with Thiocyanates, Xanthates, and Dithiocarbamates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for synthesizing &#945;&#8208;xanthates, &#945;&#8208;thiocyanates, and &#945;&#8208;dithiocarbamates has been developed. By employing molecular iodine and the potassium salts of xanthates, thiocyanate, and dithiocarbamates, a wide range of products is obtained, with yields reaching up to 83%. Sulfoxonium ylides derived from esters, ketones, amides, heterocycles, and steroids are successfully functionalized under these conditions.

In this work, a straightforward, rapid, and cost&#8208;effective protocol is presented for synthesizing three distinct classes of &#945;&#8208;functionalized sulfoxonium ylides&#8212;&#945;&#8208;xanthate, &#945;&#8208;thiocyanate, and &#945;&#8208;dithiocarbamate&#8212;via molecular iodine&#8208;mediated reactions. This method demonstrates broad substrate tolerance, including heterocycles and steroids, delivering 25 examples with yields of up to 83%. Experimental studies revealed that iodine reacts with xanthates to form disulfides, which subsequently act as electrophiles for nucleophilic attack by the ylide.

         <title>An Efficient Asymmetric Synthesis of Finerenone via Evans&#8217; Chiral Auxiliary</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study demonstrates Evans&#8217; (R)&#8208;4&#8208;benzyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazolidinone auxiliary enables efficient asymmetric synthesis of finerenone, achieving stereoselective naphthyridine core construction with 86:14 dr and 80% yield. Subsequent ammonia&#8208;mediated transamidation of the ethyl ester completes finerenone formation.

This article reports a new application of Evans&#8217; chiral auxiliary for an efficient asymmetric synthesis of finerenone. This new application successfully achieves the key step of stereoselective construction of the naphthyridine core of finerenone, with a high diastereomeric ratio (dr 86:14) and an 80% yield of the desired product via Evans&#8217; chiral (R)&#8208;4&#8208;benzyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazolidinone. The downstream transamidation of ethyl ester, with ammonia, leads to the formation of finerenone.

         <title>Anion Recognition&#8208;Induced Selective Separation of Phosphates from Complex Aqueous Matrices by Self&#8208;Assembled Molecular Capsule</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triethanolamine&#8208;based anion receptor functionalized with H&#8208;bond donating urea groups has been designed and synthesized for selective separation of hydrophilic phosphates from aqueous media of high anionic and cationic complexity. Competitive extraction experiments reveal exclusive formation of the phosphate complexes in the presence of an excess of competing anions, a prerequisite for efficient phosphate recovery from eutrophic aquatic systems.

Selective recognition of an oxoanion necessitates the design and synthesis of hydrogen bond donor receptors capable of discriminating between anions of comparable size, shape, and basicity. A urea&#8208;functionalized second&#8208;generation tripodal anion receptor has been demonstrated to selectively encapsulate and separate phosphate ions (PO43&#8208;, and HPO42&#8208;) from aqueous matrices of high anionic and cationic complexity. Competitive liquid&#8211;liquid extraction (LLE) experiments reveal exclusive formation of phosphate complexes in the presence of an excess of competing oxoanions and halide, which is a prerequisite for efficient phosphate recovery from highly eutrophic aquatic systems and also important for therapeutic applications as an effective phosphate binder. Tetrabutylammonium hydroxide has served as a receptor solubilizer and an anion&#8208;exchange agent, facilitating phosphate transfer from the aqueous to the organic phase (dichloromethane) in exchange for hydroxide ions. The identity and purity of the LLE&#8208;derived anion complexes are confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (1H, 13C, and 31P) and mass spectroscopy, establishing phosphate selectivity of the receptor. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals phosphate encapsulation within a &#960;&#8208;stacked dimeric capsular assembly of the receptor (2:1 host&#8211;guest complex).

Competitive extraction experiments reveal exclusive formation of the phosphate complexes in the presence of an excess of competing anions, a prerequisite for efficient phosphate recovery from eutrophic aquatic systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selective recognition of an oxoanion necessitates the design and synthesis of hydrogen bond donor receptors capable of discriminating between anions of comparable size, shape, and basicity. A urea-functionalized second-generation tripodal anion receptor has been demonstrated to selectively encapsulate and separate phosphate ions (PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt;, and HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;) from aqueous matrices of high anionic and cationic complexity. Competitive liquid&#8211;liquid extraction (LLE) experiments reveal exclusive formation of phosphate complexes in the presence of an excess of competing oxoanions and halide, which is a prerequisite for efficient phosphate recovery from highly eutrophic aquatic systems and also important for therapeutic applications as an effective phosphate binder. Tetrabutylammonium hydroxide has served as a receptor solubilizer and an anion-exchange agent, facilitating phosphate transfer from the aqueous to the organic phase (dichloromethane) in exchange for hydroxide ions. The identity and purity of the LLE-derived anion complexes are confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, and &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P) and mass spectroscopy, establishing phosphate selectivity of the receptor. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals phosphate encapsulation within a &#960;-stacked dimeric capsular assembly of the receptor (2:1 host&#8211;guest complex).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Morpholine&#8208;2,5&#8208;Diones by Tandem of Azido&#8208;Ugi and Ugi Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tandem of the azido&#8208;Ugi and four&#8208; or three&#8208;component Ugi reactions (Ugi&#8208;4CR, Ugi&#8208;3CR) becomes a new and unusual approach for the construction of a morpholine&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione ring functionalized with a tetrazole moiety. Preisolation of Ugi bisamides is an alternative to the one&#8208;pot transformation with intramolecular cyclization. Subsequent conversion of the morpholine&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones enables the preparation of their NH&#8208;unsubstituted tetrazole derivatives.

3,4&#8208;Disubstituted morpholine&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones containing a tetrazole moiety are unexpected products of a tandem combination of azido&#8208;Ugi and Ugi reactions. The formation of the classical products &#8211; Ugi bisamides &#8211; is not observed at all in many cases. When the simplest C1&#8208;C3 aliphatic aldehydes are used and the reaction conditions are controlled, their isolation is possible. However, when butanal and pentanal as well as para&#8208;substituted benzaldehydes are used, only products of post&#8208;Ugi transformations, morpholine&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones, can be isolated. The latter can be synthesized either sequentially from the corresponding Ugi bisamides by post&#8208;Ugi transformation or in a one&#8208;pot procedure with prolonged stirring of the reaction mixture of four components&#8211;&#945;&#8208;aminomethyltetrazole, aldehyde, monochloroacetic acid, and isocyanide. A small targeted library of 15 morpholine&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones containing a tetrazole moiety is obtained by a novel approach. Furthermore, these compounds are able to eliminate the N&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl group from the tetrazole nitrogen in the presence of acid to form the corresponding NH&#8208;unsubstituted tetrazole derivatives of morpholine&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones.

         <title>C4&#8208;Regioselective Dearomatization of Quinolinium Salts via Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traceless switch of regioselectivity: without employing any directing groups, the change of selectivity in the Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman reaction with N&#8208;alkylquinolinium electrophiles is attained. Simply by modifying the counterion in the azaarenium salt and the reaction conditions, a C4&#8208;addition of acrylate can be accomplished, complementing the earlier C2&#8208;selective protocol.

An intermolecular Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman reaction employing N&#8208;benzylquinolinium salts as electrophiles is developed. The reaction proceeds through a C4&#8208;selective dearomatization of the quinolinium substrate, contrary to the C2&#8208;regioselectivity that is observed in a previous report on a similar process. The switch in the regioselectivity is accomplished through the change of the counterion in the quinolinium salt to PF6&#8722; and the alteration of the reaction conditions, such as the application of a different catalyst (DABCO). The reaction allows for the preparation of functional group&#8208;rich products featuring the important 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline scaffold, complementing the earlier method which provides the corresponding 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinoline counterparts. The developed reaction is compatible with a range of substrates that also encompasses acridinium salts.

Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed directing group&#8208;assisted C&#63743;H functionalization, offers atom&#8208;economical routes to synthesize and functionalize complex molecules. This review covers recent advancements in N,O&#8208;bidentate directing group&#8208;assisted C&#63743;O, C&#63743;N, C&#63743;S, C&#63743;B, and C&#63743;C bond formations, integrating mechanistic insights, diverse catalysts, and synthetic applications, emphasizing their profound impact on modern organic synthesis.

During the past decades, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H functionalization has gained recognition as a powerful method in organic synthesis. This strategy provides efficient and atom&#8208;economical pathways for quickly creating molecular complexity by harnessing the abundant C&#63743;H bonds found in readily accessible chemical feedstocks. Synthetic organic chemists discover directing group (DG)&#8208;assisted C&#63743;H activation as a key tool for achieving efficient and site&#8208;selective C&#63743;H functionalization. Bidentate directing groups are particularly effective in this regard, offering a high degree of control over the reaction site. Among various directing groups, N,O&#8208;bidentate systems have gained significant attention due to their strong coordinating ability and versatility in enabling regioselective transformations. This review highlights recent advances in C&#63743;O, C&#63743;N, C&#63743;S, C&#63743;B, and C&#63743;C bond formation reactions facilitated by N,O&#8208;bidentate directing groups. The discussion encompasses mechanistic insights, catalyst systems, and synthetic applications, demonstrating the broad utility of these strategies in modern organic synthesis. A comparative analysis of different N,O&#8208;bidentate ligands and their role in tuning reactivity and selectivity is also presented.

A simple and efficient one&#8208;pot protocol has been developed for the synthesis of diverse N&#8208;arylated lactam&#8208;type iminosugars or 4&#8208;aminobutanamide derivatives through cascade radical cleavage of &#945;&#8208;amino carbonyl compounds and intra&#8208;/intermolecular amidation reactions.

A metal&#8208;free method is developed for the synthesis of N&#8208;arylated lactam&#8208;type iminosugars using hydrogen peroxide (35% in water) as an oxidant. The reaction of various &#945;&#8208;amino carbonyl compounds is performed in methanol, and the active methylene adjacent to the carbonyl group is rapidly removed to form a carboxylic acid as the key intermediate through a cascade radical cleavage reaction. Following an intramolecular amidation reaction, a series of N&#8208;arylated lactam&#8208;type iminosugars are prepared in satisfactory yields, providing an alternative protocol for the synthesis of such bioactive iminosugars. Additionally, several 4&#8208;aminobutanamide derivatives are obtained by intermolecular amidation of the carboxylic acid intermediate.

A novel monofluoroallylsulfonium salt (MFAS) is synthesized from the inexpensive industrial chemical 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene in three steps with high efficiency. This reagent reacts readily with a series of alkylzinc reagents under copper catalysis to yield allylic monofluorides with high regioselectivity and excellent yields.

A bench&#8208;stable and scalable monofluoroallylsulfonium salt (MFAS) has been developed for highly regioselective mono&#8208;fluoroallylation. This reagent is synthesized from the inexpensive industrial chemical 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene in three steps with high efficiency. The reaction of alkylzinc reagents with MFAS proceeds smoothly under copper catalysis, yielding allylic monofluorides with excellent regioselectivity and high reaction efficiency.

Isoquinolin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;one is a core structure in many bioactive molecules, natural products, and advanced materials. Its efficient and sustainable synthesis has garnered significant attention in organic synthesis. This review highlights recent advancements in the synthesis of isoquinolin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;one via metal&#8208;catalyzed, metal&#8208;free, photocatalytic, and electrocatalytic methods.

This abstract highlights recent advancements in the synthesis of isoquinolin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;one via metal&#8208;catalyzed, metal&#8208;free, photocatalytic, and electro&#8208;catalytic methods. Transition metal catalysis, employing palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, cobalt, copper, etc. complexes, enables versatile cyclization and functionalization pathways. Metal&#8208;free approaches leverage organo&#8208;catalysts and green oxidants for milder, environmentally benign conditions. Photocatalysis utilizes visible&#8208;light&#8208;active catalysts, enabling oxidative or reductive transformations with minimal waste. Electrocatalysis, offering tunable electrochemical conditions, facilitates C&#63743;H activation and coupling strategies under ambient conditions. These methodologies display high regio&#8208; and chemo&#8208;selectivity, broad substrate scope, and improved sustainability. Advances in these areas underscore the synergistic potential of combining catalytic techniques for the design of novel synthetic routes. This review serves as a foundation for developing more efficient and eco&#8208;friendly approaches to constructing the isoquinolin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;one scaffold.

         <title>A C3&#8208;Symmetric Diphenylethylendiamine&#8208;Based Catalyst in the Asymmetric Michael Addition of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones with 4&#8208;Hydroxycoumarin and 4&#8208;Hydroxyquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;One</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two C3&#8208;symmetric organocatalysts with multiple amino groups are prepared and employed in the asymmetric addition of 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarin and quinoline&#8208;2&#8208;one to unsaturated ketones. The all&#8208;amino version of the catalyst induces the better stereoselectivity and provides the products in up to 95% yield. A successful gram&#8208;scale reaction and catalyst reuse (three&#8208;fold) attest to the potential of the C3&#8208;symmetric catalyst.

Even though the amino&#8208;organocatalysis has been known for decades, the use of chiral C3&#8208;symmetric multiamino catalysts in asymmetric synthesis is not widespread. Herein, the previously employed approach for the chiral 1,2&#8208;diamino&#8208;cyclohexane to the enantiopure 1,2&#8208;diphenylethylendiamine is extended. The independent activity of each catalytic subunit is also confirmed for this enantiopure motif by offline high&#8208;resolution electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) experiments. The advantages and limitations of this novel approach in the asymmetric Michael addition of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones to 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarin and 4&#8208;hydroxyquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;one, achieving up to 95% yield and moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good stereocontrol (enantiomeric ratio up to 80:20) are evaluated. In the pool of synthetized molecules, there are two novel compounds, and one is prepared for the first time using organocatalysis. In addition, some of these molecules show an intrinsic scavenging ability on ABTS&#8226;+ radical.

         <title>The Dihydroindeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene Core: From Syntheses to Properties and Potential Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the latest research progress in synthesis and application of variously decorated aromatic compounds possessing the indeno[2.1&#8208;c]fluorene scaffold is summarized. In addition to covering synthetic endeavors, their transformation to other structurally related aromatic compounds and their physical properties and possible applications are also outlined.

In the last decade, substances possessing the dihydroindeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene scaffold show interesting photophysical properties and other potential applications in electronics. The aforementioned compounds belong to the family of five regioisomeric dihydroindenofluorenes, but unlike other ones, they possess angular or, in the case of higher congeners, helical shape. This review is mainly focused on various synthetic approaches to compounds possessing the dihydroindeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene scaffold and their conversions to other polyaromatic hydrocarbons. In addition, their physicochemical and photophysical properties, and current and/or potential applications are briefly described as well.

         <title>Nickel Chloride Hexahydrate&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Synthesis of Quinolines and Bis&#8208;Quinolines Under Aerial Oxidation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of quinoline and bis&#8208;quinoline derivatives is reported using nickel chloride hexahydrate catalyst via Michael addition followed by aldol condensation from &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone and o&#8208;aminobenzyl alcohol. The protocol enables access to products in good to excellent yields in toluene at 100&#8201;&#176;C and in open&#8208;air condition under green chemistry metrics of the reaction.

Two&#8208;component synthesis of quinoline and bis&#8208;quinoline derivatives using nickel chloride hexahydrate as a catalyst via Michael addition followed by aldol condensation from &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone and o&#8208;aminobenzyl alcohol. This protocol enables access to phenyl(2&#8208;phenylquinolin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methanone and bis(2&#8208;phenylquinolin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methanone derivatives in good to excellent yields using toluene solvent at 100&#8201;&#176;C temperature in open&#8208;air condition. Nickel chloride hexahydrate has been utilized in this study to oxidize benzyl alcohols to intermediate benzaldehydes. Green chemistry metrics of the reaction explain the dominance of the methodology.

         <title>Mild Photocatalytic Hydrodecarboxylation of Fatty Acid Derivatives using Xanthene Dyes for Biomass Valorization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elegant xanthene&#8208;based method for metal&#8208; and hydrogen&#8208;free photocatalytic deoxygenation of lipidic biomass is reported, featuring DIPEA as a dual&#8208;function sacrificial reductant and hydrogen donor, enabling efficient one&#8208;pot Cn&#8211;1 hydrocarbon synthesis under mild, open&#8208;air conditions.

A complementary and practical method for the synthesis of renewable Cn&#8211;1 hydrocarbons with yields of up to 80%, via mild photocatalytic hydrodecarboxylation of fatty acids activated as N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters, is reported herein. Inexpensive, easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, and environmentally friendly xanthene dyes (Eosin Y or Fluorescein&#8208;Na2) act as photocatalysts, with DIPEA serving as both sacrificial reductant and hydrogen donor. The reactions proceed under visible light, at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, in open&#8208;air conditions. Additionally, a one&#8208;pot application is demonstrated, involving in&#8201;situ ester formation and scale&#8208;up using a real mixture of fatty acids derived from vegetable oil, for photocatalytic biomass valorization.

Fjord&#8208;Stitching Strategy Enables Chiral Heteroatom&#8208;Doped Zigzag Hydrocarbon Belts! Herein, the synthesis of chiral heteroatom&#8208;embedded hydrocarbon belts via fjord&#8208;stitching C&#63743;N coupling reactions of easily accessible resorcin[4]arene and resorcin[6]arene derivatives with diverse chiral amines is demonstrated.

Herein, the synthesis of diverse chiral O/N&#8208;doped zigzag hydrocarbon belts based on bridging of the fjords of resorcin[4]arene and resorcin[6]arene derivatives with chiral amines through palladium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular C&#63743;N bond formation reactions is reported. The resulting nanobelts exhibit unique chiral cavity structures and demonstrate intriguing chiroptical properties.

Our iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation methodology affords high product yields and does not require pre&#8208;functionalized substrates &#8211; a distinct advantage over conventional Heck&#8208;type cyclization protocols. Substrate scope and mechanistic investigations reveal that electron&#8208;donating substituents on the ring D moiety are critical for successful cyclization.These observations are consistent with a reaction pathway involving electrophilic aromatic substitution of an iridium species onto ring D.

An intramolecular iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation process is described for the synthesis of the title scaffold from phenacyl enamide substrates. This method achieves high yields while eliminating the requirement for prefunctionalized substrates, as compared to Heck&#8208;type cyclization methodologies. Substrate scope and mechanistic studies indicate that the presence of electron&#8208;donating substituents in the incipient ring D moiety is essential for the cyclization, consistent with a pathway involving electrophilic aromatic substitution of iridium in ring D.

         <title>Cobalt(I)&#8208;Catalyzed E&#8208;Selective Hydroalkynylation of Terminal Alkynes or Internal Alkynes with Silyl&#8208;Substituted Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cross&#8208;hydroalkynylation of silyl&#8208;substituted terminal alkynes, acting as CH&#8208;donor alkynes, with aryl&#8208; or alkyl&#8208;substituted terminal alkynes, acting as acceptor alkynes, is described. Cross&#8208;hydroalkynylation with internal alkynes acting as acceptor alkynes is successful when at least one aryl substituent is present. The reaction optimization is performed by the Design of Experiments approach, limiting the needed test reactions to a minimum.

A stereoselective cross&#8208;dimerization between silyl&#8208;substituted donor alkynes and aryl&#8208; or alkyl&#8208;substituted terminal acceptor alkynes using an in&#8201;situ generated Co(I)&#8208;phosphine catalyst is reported. The reaction optimization for both classes of acceptor alkynes is conducted via Design of Experiments and showed high E&#8208;selectivities using different reaction conditions. Moreover, activated internal alkynes are successfully applied as acceptor alkynes in the cross&#8208;hydroalkynylation, leading to highly substituted 1,3&#8208;enynes in good regioselectivities and good to excellent yields.

         <title>A Fullerene&#8208;Based Selenosugar Ball</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fullerene hexakis&#8208;adduct decorated with 12 peripheral seleno&#8208;d&#8208;talitol moieties is synthesized efficiently with a Th&#8208;symmetry from a hexakis&#8208;adduct of [60]fullerene prepared by a cycloaddition reaction and subsequent copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition click chemistry. This new compound is characterized by analytical and spectroscopic techniques and is tested on human keratinocyte HaCaT cells to determine its cytotoxicity and potential applications.

Fullerenes functionalized with selenosugar moieties are of particular interest because of their important properties, as one fragment enhances the properties of the other. Selenosugars are not only solubilizing groups, but their intrinsic biological properties also provide additional attractive features to the conjugates. Here the synthesis is reported of a fullerene hexakis&#8208;adduct decorated with 12 peripheral seleno&#8208;d&#8208;talitol moieties with a Th&#8208;symmetric structure, which can be efficiently synthesized from the hexakis&#8208;adduct of [60]fullerene prepared via a cycloaddition reaction and subsequent copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition click chemistry. This large&#8208;scale system, refer to as the selenosugar ball (SeB), has been characterized by 1H&#8201;NMR and 13C&#8201;NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, UV&#8208;spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Theoretical calculations using the multilevel DFT&#8208;B3LYP&#8208;D3(BJ)/6&#8211;311&#8201;G(2&#8201;d,p)//PM7 methodology are performed to predict the most stable conformation for the compound and to determine the factors that control the geometry of this molecule. In addition, some physicochemical parameters are estimated. Also, this new compound is tested on human keratinocyte HaCaT cells to determine its cytotoxicity and potential applications.

         <title>The Reactivity of &#945;&#8208;Fluorinated Mono&#8208; and Diketones Uncovers their Potential as Electrophilic Warheads for Reversible Covalent Drugs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential of fluorinated mono&#8208; and diketones as electrophilic warheads for reversible covalent drugs is described by studying their equilibria reactions with the protected nucleophilic amino acids serine, cysteine and lysine.

Fluorinated diketones (FDKs) are electrophilic moieties holding unique molecular properties that make them potential reversible and multifaceted covalent warheads for drug design. To further explore this potential, the multicomponent equilibrium systems of various fluorinated monoketones (FMKs) and FDKs in the presence of the relevant nucleophilic amino acids serine, cysteine, and lysine are studied. These equilibrium systems are investigated using 19&#8201;F&#8208; and 13C&#8208; NMR spectroscopy, and reveal that for both cysteine and lysine most of the FMKs and FDKs studied may potentially serve as electrophilic warheads for reversible covalent drugs.

         <title>Exploring the Impact of Topological Variations on the Stability of the Ground Singlet and Lowest&#8208;Lying Triplet States of Catacondensed Hexabenzenoids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of topological features on the stability of 37 catacondensed hexabenzenoids in their ground singlet and lowest&#8208;lying triplet states is investigated using a multivariate regression model. This analysis reveals key structural factors governing stability, providing insights into the design of polybenzene&#8208;based materials.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) such as tetracenes, pentacenes, hexacenes, and some higher acenes play a central role in organic electronics due to their unique electronic properties. The impact of topological variations on the relative stability of PAH isomers in different electronic states is poorly understood, with limited insights into how Clar &#960;&#8208;sextets and topological features such as bay, cove, fjord, and K&#8208;regions influence stability in their ground singlet (S0) and lowest&#8208;lying triplet (T1) states. In this work, density functional theory calculations of the S0 and T1 states of the 37 catacondensed hexabenzenoids are performed. A multivariate linear regression model with relative energy as the dependent variable and a series of topological parameters as the independent variables is used to quantify the effect of topology in the relative stability of the catacondensed hexabenzenoids. Analysis shows that, in S0, stability is enhanced by an increase in the number of Clar &#960;&#8208;sextets and K&#8208;regions and decreased by the presence of coves and fjords. In T1, the main stabilizing factors are the number of Clar &#960;&#8208;sextets and the number of rings involved in the antiaromatic region, whereas topological regions such as K&#8208;edges, bays, coves, or fjords are destabilizing.

         <title>Novel Ambergris Odorants Devoid of Ketal Functions: Sustainable Synthesis of 4&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;Cedren&#8208;8&#8208;yl)Butan&#8208;2&#8208;Ones and Potent Methoxy Derivatives by Claisen Chemistry**</title>

         <dc:description>
The mystery behind the new odorant. Ambronova from sustainable &#945;&#8208;cedrane is not only the unusual polar methoxy group in the ketal moiety but also two novel methoxy ketones accessible in pure form by Claisen chemistry from &#946;&#8208;cedren&#8208;9&#945;&#8208;ol and methoxy acetone. Their highly potent dry&#8208;woody ambergris notes prove that a ketal function is no prerequisite for a dry woody ambergris odorant.

Challenging the importance of the ketal functionality in ambergris odorants, the optionally &#945;&#8208;methoxy substituted ketones 18&#8211;20 are designed using an olfactophore model and synthesized by Claisen chemistry from &#946;&#8208;cedren&#8208;9&#945;&#8208;ol (25) as a sustainable starting material with methoxy acetone (15) and acetone dimethyl ketal (29) as synthetic building blocks. Elimination of one alkoxy group with phosphoric acid in pyridine furnished vinyl ethers to which &#946;&#8208;cedren&#8208;9&#945;&#8208;ol (25) is added in the presence of acetic acid. Thermal Claisen rearrangement of the resulting adducts then provides the target compound 18&#8211;20 that possesses potent dry woody&#8208;ambery odors with musky aspects that make them ideally suited for oud accords. Surprisingly, the &#945;&#8208;methoxy substituted ketones 18 and 19 are also formed in the synthesis of the new odorant Ambronova, where they contribute to a more musky&#8208;soft, sensual&#8208;animalic character compared to Ambrocenide (1) with additional peppery accents. The content of the desirable 3&#8208;methoxy ketone 19 could be increased by using 1,2,2&#8208;trimethoxypropane (21), thereby finetuning the Ambronova quality. These results show that a ketal functionality is no longer an indispensable prerequisite for an ambergris odorant, which should facilitate the design of further high&#8208;impact ambergris odorants devoid of ketal functionalities with potentially enhanced biodegradability.

         <title>Denitrogenative Triazole Ring Cleavage in Synthesis of 2&#8208;Functionalized (Cyclo)alkyl&#8208;4.5&#8208;Unsubstituted Oxazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 2&#8208;(cyclo)alkyl&#8208;substituted oxazoles is synthesized via a denitrogenative triazole ring&#8208;cleavage strategy. The solvent&#8208;free conditions allow the introduction of primary and secondary amines, as well as carboxylic and alkoxycarboxylic groups on the (cyclo)alkyl side chain. The approach is also applicable to optically active substrates, enabling the synthesis of oxazole&#8208;containing &#945;&#8208;amino acids from readily available D&#8208; and L&#8208;aspartic acid.

Denitrogenative triazole ring cleavage is applied for the preparation of a broad set of 2&#8208;(cyclo)alkylo&#8208;xazole derivatives. The proposed procedures involve carrying out the reaction of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole with various functionally substituted acid chlorides in sulfolane or under neat conditions. Despite the exothermic nature of the reaction, it affords the target products in high yield. Various functional groups are tolerated in the (cyclo)alkyl chain such as protected primary and secondary amine and esters. The developed procedure is applied for the preparation of optically active amino acids featuring oxazole moiety.

Recent Advances in Catalyst&#8208;Mediated [6&#8201;+&#8201;4] Cycloaddition Reactions: A Concise Review</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Higher&#8208;order cycloaddition reactions, especially [6+4] cycloaddition reactions, have been widely applied in the construction of 10&#8208;membered rings and natural compounds. However, these reactions encounter several challenges, including achieving regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, overcoming high activation energy barriers, and managing multiple reaction pathways. In this review, we summarize the reported on [6+4] cycloaddition reactions, highlighting various catalysts, including metal, Lewis acid, organocatalysts, and enzyme&#8208;based catalysts.

Higher&#8208;order cycloaddition reactions (CRs) are significant in providing quick access to different polycyclic and complex molecules. In particular, [6&#8201;+&#8201;4] CRs have been widely applied in the construction of 10&#8208;membered rings, bridged molecules, and natural compounds. However, these reactions encounter several challenges, including achieving regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, overcoming high activation energy barriers, and managing multiple reaction pathways. Over the past decade, numerous catalysts have been developed to address these challenges. The present review summarizes the reported research (2000&#8211;2024) on [6&#8201;+&#8201;4] CRs, highlighting various catalysts, including metal, Lewis acid, organocatalysts, and enzyme&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>A Concave Mirror Photoreactor Design for Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel concave mirror&#8208;based photoreactor boosts reaction rates across diverse visible&#8208;light transformations. This modular, cost&#8208;effective design enhances illumination of the reaction mixture, accelerates photocatalytic transformations and supports small&#8208;scale experiments, offering a practical solution for researchers in the field.

A novel photoreactor design for enhanced reaction efficiency and reproducibility is disclosed. The performance of the new setup with a spherical mirror&#8208;like architecture is evaluated through six versatile visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven transformations reported in the literature. Inexpensive, modular, and adaptable, photoreactor enables an increase in optical power and provides significant acceleration of photocatalytic reactions in all cases. Parallel experiments as well as small&#8208;scale chemistry are also examined.

         <title>Synthesis of Thioxothiazolidinone and Iminothiazolidinone Derivatives via Dicyano Epoxide&#8208;Based Multicomponent Reactions in Green Media</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;component reaction of dicyanoepoxide toward the efficient synthesis of thiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thiones, 2&#8208;imino&#8208;thiazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones and amido dithiocarbamate, in green media has been described. The use of green solvents, metal and catalyst&#8208;free, mild reaction conditions and excellent product yields are among the most important advantages of this sustainable approach.

A green and efficient multicomponent protocol has been developed for the synthesis of thiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thiones via the reaction of carbon disulfide, primary amines, and dicyanoepoxides in water. The transformation proceeds under mild, catalyst&#8208;free conditions, offering broad substrate scope and good to excellent yields. Notably, using secondary amine selectively affords a dithiocarbamate derivative, highlighting tunable chemoselectivity. A complementary reaction involving isothiocyanates, primary amines, and dicyanoepoxides in ethanol enables access to 2&#8208;imino&#8208;thiazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones. Both methods provide sustainable, scalable routes to biologically relevant heterocycles.

Syntheses of Annoglabasin A and Annomosin A, ent&#8208;Kaurane Diterpenoids from Annonaceae, Using Stevia Sweetener as a Cost&#8208;Effective Synthetic Source</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article describes a cost&#8208;effective and scalable synthetic method for the preparation of ent&#8208;kaurane diterpenoids from commercially available stevia sweeteners. By enabling the efficient synthesis of ent&#8208;kaurenol, this approach facilitates access to a wide variety of structurally diverse and stereochemically defined kaurane derivatives, including annomosin A and annoglabasin A.

A practical and cost&#8208;effective method is developed for preparing steviol from commercially available stevia sweetener. As steviol can be efficiently converted into ent&#8208;kaurenol, this strategy enables the large&#8208;scale synthesis of ent&#8208;kaurenol and its derivatives. To demonstrate the versatility of ent&#8208;kaurenol as a synthetic intermediate, several derivatives are synthesized, including carboxylic acid and diol compounds with controlled C&#8208;16 stereochemistry. This methodology is applied to the synthesis of the ent&#8208;kaurane dimer annomosin A, isolated from Annona squamosa, and the bioactive diterpene annoglabasin A, from Annona glabra. The approach allows access to structurally diverse kaurane derivatives with defined C&#8208;16 stereochemistry and is readily extendable to the synthesis of kaurane dimers. Given the limited understanding of the biosynthetic pathways and biological functions of natural kaurane dimers, this synthetic strategy provides a valuable platform for future structural and functional investigations.

         <title>Sonogashira&#8208;like Reaction of the Biellmann BODIPY and Fluorescence Staining of the Tomato Crop Bacterial Pathogen Clavibacter michiganensis with the Resulting Products</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A meso&#8208;methylsulfanyl&#8208;BODIPY derivative (Biellmann BODIPY) underwent Sonogashira&#8208;like cross&#8208;coupling with terminal alkynes under mild conditions to yield a family of novel fluorescent meso&#8208;arylethynyl BODIPYs. These derivatives are characterized by photophysical and computational methods, and some are successfully applied as fluorescent markers for the selective staining of the phytopathogen Clavibacter michiganensis.

Meso&#8208;methylsulfanylBODIPY (Biellmann BODIPY) participated in a Sonogashira&#8208;like reaction with terminal alkynes, thereby broadening its application as a privileged building block. A series of meso&#8208;substituted BODIPYs with arylethynyl groups of different electronic character is prepared (7 new derivatives), as well as a single by&#8208;product having a meso&#8208;double bond. The photophysical properties of the series are experimentally studied by static and dynamic spectroscopy, and the results are rationalized by theoretical calculations. The molecules with triple bonds present absorption and emission maxima that are redshifted with respect to the derivative with a double bond, and larger fluorescence quantum yields, likely because of lower energy losses due to internal conversion.

Interestingly, the BODIPY bearing the &#8211;C&#8801;C&#8211;SiMe3 group does not interact with the bacteria, while for the other two derivatives, the stained Cm are clearly detected by laser scanning microscopy.

&lt;p&gt;A meso-methylsulfanyl-BODIPY derivative (Biellmann BODIPY) underwent Sonogashira-like cross-coupling with terminal alkynes under mild conditions to yield a family of novel fluorescent meso-arylethynyl BODIPYs. These derivatives are characterized by photophysical and computational methods, and some are successfully applied as fluorescent markers for the selective staining of the phytopathogen &lt;i&gt;Clavibacter michiganensis&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meso-methylsulfanylBODIPY (Biellmann BODIPY) participated in a Sonogashira-like reaction with terminal alkynes, thereby broadening its application as a privileged building block. A series of meso-substituted BODIPYs with arylethynyl groups of different electronic character is prepared (7 new derivatives), as well as a single by-product having a meso-double bond. The photophysical properties of the series are experimentally studied by static and dynamic spectroscopy, and the results are rationalized by theoretical calculations. The molecules with triple bonds present absorption and emission maxima that are redshifted with respect to the derivative with a double bond, and larger fluorescence quantum yields, likely because of lower energy losses due to internal conversion.

         <title>Decarboxylative Alkylation of Difluoroenoxysilanes via Visible Light&#8208;Excited Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Complex</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven decarboxylative alkylation reaction is reported, mediated by a photoexcited electron donor&#8211;acceptor complex formed by redox&#8208;active esters and triphenylamine.

This study presents a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven, photocatalyst&#8208;free method for synthesizing &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroketones via electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex activation. Using cost&#8208;effective aliphatic carboxylic acid derivatives redox&#8208;active esters, the protocol enables decarboxylative difluoroalkylation under mild conditions, achieving high yields (up to 94%) with triphenylamine. Mechanistic studies confirm radical intermediates and a 1:1 EDA complex stoichiometry. The method demonstrates broad substrate scope and successful late&#8208;stage drug modifications, offering a sustainable approach to fluorinated bioactive compounds.

Galactose Oxidase&#8208;Catalyzed Benchtop and Electrochemical Oxidation of C1&#8208;Alkylated &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Galactopyranoside Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wild&#8208;type galactose oxidase (GalOx) is used to oxidize C&#8208;1 substituted &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;galactopyranosides bearing linear, branched, or cyclic groups. Reaction conditions are optimized for both benchtop and electrochemical setups. Substrate&#8208;dependent reactivity trends reveal that C&#8208;1 modifications influence enzyme&#8211;substrate interactions without preventing oxidation. Electrochemical activation offers a viable horseradish peroxidase&#8208;free alternative.

The reaction conditions of wild&#8208;type galactose oxidase (GalOx)&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of C&#8208;1 alkylated &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;galactopyranoside derivatives are established and optimized. The benchtop oxidation reaction uses a three&#8208;enzyme system comprising GalOx, catalase, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Under the optimized conditions, methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;galactopyranoside achieves 86% conversion after 24&#8201;h of reaction at room temperature. No previous study has investigated how the C&#8208;1 position of &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;galactopyranoside derivatives influences GalOx&#8211;substrate interactions. To address this, a panel of C&#8208;1 alkylated &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;galactopyranoside derivatives is synthesized and tested for the first time. The results show that although GalOx tolerates modifications at the C&#8208;1 position, the size, shape, and electronic properties of the substituent significantly affect catalytic efficiency. The same &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;galactopyranoside derivatives are also investigated on an electrochemical setup, which replaces the HRP activator with electrochemical activation. The electrochemical activation method achieves comparable conversion and preserves substrate specificity, offering a promising and cost&#8208;effective alternative to traditional enzymatic setups. This work provides a foundation for understanding C&#8208;1 structural tolerance in GalOx&#8211;substrate interactions and demonstrates electrochemical activation as a promising and practical alternative to traditional enzymatic activation.

         <title>General and Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Selective Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Alkylation of Arenes and Heteroarenes with Non&#8208;Activated Olefins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convenient and scalable Ni&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;Marovnikov hydroaryation non&#8208;functionalized olefins has been developed.

The majority of C&#8211;C coupling reactions between arenes and olefins result in the formation of branched isomer products, exhibiting what is known as Markovnikov selectivity. However, alternative catalytic strategies are required to modulate this selectivity, thereby yielding linear isomer products that are crucial for various significant applications. In this study, a straightforward Ni0&#8211;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyst is presented for the anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroarylation of unactivated olefins with arenes (benzene) and heteroarenes (pyridine, indole, and imidazopyridine derivatives). The active catalyst species are in&#8201;situ generated from NHC ligands and a stable NiII salt that is reduced by an alkaline hydride (NaH, LiH). This strategy circumvents the elaborate procedures that have been employed to synthesize and isolate Ni0&#8211;NHC complexes. The assessment of &gt;15 reactions between olefins and (hetero)arenes shows the formation of linear isomers as the predominant products, with yields ranging from moderate to excellent and exceptional selectivity.

         <title>Synthetic Route to Fluoroalkylselenylchalcogeno Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of molecules with emerging fluorinated substituents associating fluoroalkyl group, selenium and another chalcogen (RF&#8211;Se&#8211;E&#8211;R) has been described. These molecules were easily obtained by using electrophilic fluoroalkylselenolating reagents and thiols, selenols, disulfides, diselenides or ditellurides.

In order to obtain new molecules with specific properties, the design of new fluorinated emerging group is an interesting approach. Herein, the development of new fluorinated motifs is described by associating fluoroalkyl groups with selenium and another chalcogen. Such compounds are obtained by efficient electrophilic fluoralkylselenolations of chalcogen substrates by using two previously described reagents. Thus, molecules bearing RFSeS, RFSeSe and RFSeTe motifs have been obtained with good yields.

         <title>Effects of Ring Strain on Molecular Dynamics of Sterically Hindered 4,7&#8208;Phenanthroline Unit</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sterically hindered 1,10&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;4,7&#8208;phenanthroline derivative is synthesized via the Povarov reaction and incorporated into a cyclic conjugated structure via a gold macrocyclic complex to evaluate effects of ring strain on molecular dynamics of the 4,7&#8722;phenanthroline moieties. The rotation rate of the phenyl groups in the cyclic trimer is faster than that in the model compound without ring strain. 

The Povarov reaction is a well&#8208;known multicomponent reaction for the synthesis of quinoline derivatives from anilines, arylaldehydes, and dienophiles such as electron&#8208;rich alkenes and alkynes. In this study, a sterically hindered 1,10&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;4,7&#8208;phenanthroline derivative is synthesized via the Povarov reaction and incorporated into a cyclic conjugated structure to evaluate the effects of ring strain on the molecular dynamics of the 4,7&#8208;phenanthroline moieties. The phenanthroline derivative is converted into a cyclic trimer, [3]McPhen, via a gold (Au) macrocyclic complex. The rate of rotation of the phenyl groups in [3]McPhen is found to be faster than that in the model compound without ring strain. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the ring strain of [3]McPhen causes a favorable orientation of the phenyl groups for rotation. This research offers valuable insights into the influence of ring strain on the dynamics of the molecular components.

         <title>Fast Oxidative Coupling Giving Functionalized Biaryls via Organocuprates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast access to functionalized symmetrical biaryls from bromoarenes has been achieved by a flash&#8208;flow sequence involving lithiation, transmetalation to copper, and oxidative coupling. Flash sequence has enabled the coupling of the substrates including reactive functional groups such as bromo, cyano, and nitro groups within seconds.

A fast, continuous&#8208;flow, and sequential reaction system composed of organolithium generation&#8211;transmetalation&#8211;coupling within seconds are developed. The choice of oxidants and the equivalent of copper species remarkably vary the reaction selectivity toward the biaryl coupling and/or the phenol formation. Short&#8208;lived aryllithium species, including bromo&#8208;, cyano&#8208;, or nitro&#8208;substituents, are successfully controlled under fast&#8208;flow conditions, despite the instability after transmetalation giving the organocopper species.

         <title>5&#8208;Bromo&#8208;8&#8208;Nitro&#8208;1&#8208;Naphthoic Acid as Protective Group for Alcohols Under Mitsunobu Conditions</title>

         <dc:description>
Protection of alcohols is carried out using the readily available 5&#8208;bromo&#8208;8&#8208;nitro&#8208;1&#8208;naphthoic acid (NNapOH). Under Mitsunobu conditions, primary and secondary alcohols are converted into the corresponding esters, which are subsequently deprotected under mild reduction conditions.

The use of the readily available 5&#8208;bromo&#8208;8&#8208;nitro&#8208;1&#8208;naphthoic acid (NNapOH) as a protective group for primary and secondary alcohols is described. Protection is carried out under Mitsunobu conditions, and the protective group can be readily removed under mild reducing conditions, due to the significant steric strain between C&#8208;1 and C&#8208;8 naphthalene substituents. The reaction has been tested with different hydroxy substrates, including monoalcohols, 1,2&#8208;diols, and the anticancer ribonucleoside 5&#8208;fluorouridine. Interestingly, in the case of linear 1,2&#8208;diols, protection occurs preferentially at the secondary alcohol. In addition, orthogonal protection is obtained with N&#8208;Boc hydroxy amino acid derivatives.

         <title>Photochemical Arylation Reactions Mediated by a Terpyridine Cobalt Complex</title>

         <dc:description>
The cobalt(II) complex [Co(4'&#8208;MeO&#8208;tpy)2](PF6)2 catalyzes the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven arylation of 1&#8208;methyl&#8208; and 1&#8208;phenylpyrrole, 1,3,5&#8208;trimethoxybenzene, and bis(pinacolato)diborane. This work demonstrates that cobalt&#8208;mediated C&#63743;H arylation can be significantly enhanced through ligand modification.

The complex [CoII(4&#8242;&#8208;MeO&#8208;tpy)2](PF6)2 (4&#8242;&#8208;MeO&#8208;tpy&#8201;=&#8201;4&#8242;&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8243;&#8208;terpyridine) effectively mediates the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven arylation of pyrroles, 1,3,5&#8208;trimethoxybenzene, and bis(pinacolato)diborane (B2Pin2). Mechanistic studies suggest the reaction likely proceeds via a halogen atom transfer mechanism facilitated by an &#945;&#8208;aminyl radical. This work highlights the potential of optimizing the ligand framework and reaction conditions to advance the application of earth&#8208;abundant transition metal complexes in photoredox catalysis.

A trifluoromethylation/cyclization of alkenes to access trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted fused indoles using trifluoromethylsulfonyl&#8208;pyridinium salt is achieved under photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions.

A photochemical trifluoromethylation/cyclization of alkenes to access trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted fused indoles using trifluoromethylsulfonyl&#8208;pyridinium salt (TFSP) is achieved under photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions. Mechanistic studies revealed the formation of an electron donor&#8211;acceptor complex between indole and TFSP, distinguishing this protocol from iridium&#8208;catalyzed TFSP&#8208;based trifluoromethylation reactions and suggesting a different mechanistic pathway.

         <title>Nucleophilic Trifluoromethoxylation of Benzyl Bromides via Carbonyl Diimidazole</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Previous reports on accessing trifluoromethoxylated compounds have been limited by utilizing toxic/volatile/expensive precursors that required multistep preparation of trifluoromethylating reagents. Herein, this study proposes an efficient nucleophilic trifluoromethoxylation protocol via commercially available, inexpensive, bench&#8208;stable and solid reagent, carbonyl diimidazole and AgF as the fluoride source through a novel mechanism not involving AgOCF3 as an intermediate.

An operationally simple nucleophilic trifluoromethoxylation protocol via an inexpensive, commercially available and bench stable reagent, carbonyl diimidazole and AgF is presented. Mechanistic studies are performed to reveal that this method does not proceed through the conventional trifluoromethoxide anion pathway that generates toxic difluorophosgene as an intermediate.

         <title>Fluorescent &#946;&#8208;Sheet&#8208;Based Peptide Hydrogels with Aggregation&#8208;Enhanced Emission Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent hydrogels from 1,8&#8208;naphtalimide&#8208;based peptides are designed and characterized; the materials are injectable and present enhanced emission upon &#946;&#8208;sheet formation.

Novel fluorescent peptide hydrogels are reported by combining 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide&#8208;derived amino acids with a previously developed peptide&#8208;based controlled drug release matrix. Aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission is achieved by inserting the fluorescent naphthalimide moieties in a peptide sequence with self&#8208;assembling properties. The formation of &#946;&#8208;sheets directs the orientation of the luminescent side chains, leading to the avoidance of aggregation&#8208;caused quenching. The relation between the &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;underpinned fiber formation and the emission characteristics is further elucidated by spectroscopic and microscopic techniques, including correlative fluorescence and atomic force microscopy imaging. Owing to the incorporation of the naphthalimide moiety, the gelation concentration is lowered and the gel strength improved. The resulting hydrogels does not contain any organic solvent (in contrast to ample literature examples), present thixotropic behavior, and the fluorescent properties are sensitive to environmental conditions such as temperature and medium. These features make the soft biomaterials interesting for applications such as biosensing, real&#8208;time bioimaging, and 3D printing. The high tunability of the peptide sequence composition and configuration, as well as the chemical structure of the 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide moiety, allows for modulating the material toward desired properties.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Rearrangement Driven Formal (3&#8201;+&#8201;2) Cycloaddition of Enaminone&#8208;Based Thioalkynes with Nitriles to Form Thiazole Containing Bis&#8208;Heterocycles</title>

         <dc:description>
The multi&#8208;bond forming reactions in a single synthetic operation remain an attractive yet challenging transformation. Herein, one&#8208;pot synthesis of thiazole&#8208;containing dihydropyridone derivatives, driven by ring rearrangement and formal (3&#8201;+&#8201;2) cycloaddition reaction of enaminone&#8208;based alkynyl sulfide with nitrile, is reported. This protocol is operationally simple and features a wider substrate scope delivering medicinally relevant scaffold.

Herein, a one&#8208;pot synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydropyridin&#8208;2(H)&#8208;one containing thiazole derivatives is reported by Bronsted acid&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;rearrangement and formal (3&#8201;+&#8201;2) cycloaddition reaction of enaminone&#8208;based thioalkyne with alkyl/aryl nitrile. The developed protocol demonstrates a wide substrate scope for both the reacting partners with high atom&#8208;economy furnishing very high to excellent yields of pharmaceutically relevant bis&#8208;heterocyclic derivatives. Based on outcome of the product and control experiments, a plausible reaction mechanism has also been proposed. The gram&#8208;scale synthesis and further synthetic transformation demonstrate the synthetic efficacy and utility of the developed protocol.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of Secondary Alcohols Using Connon Type Catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The kinetic resolution of alcohols mediated by Connon&#8208;type catalysts depends on electronic substituent effects rather than substrate or catalyst size.

Chiral pyridine derivatives following the general design principle proposed by Connon et al. are employed in the Lewis base mediated kinetic resolution of secondary alcohols. Variations in the size of substrates and catalyst substituents are found to impact reaction selectivity in a nonsystematic manner, while best selectivities are found for catalyst variants carrying electron&#8208;acceptor&#8208;substituted side chains. Solvent effects are found to be small for the most active and most selective catalysts studied, but more significant for less selective catalysts. The quantitative assessment of reaction kinetics points to a rather limited contribution of background acylation reactivity, but to a very significant temperature effect on reaction outcome.

         <title>Expanding the Chemical Space of Sugar Frameworks by Quaternization of the Anomeric Carbon Atom</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel C,C and C,N bifunctional fucosides are stereoselectively obtained starting from a common anomeric bromide intermediate. The developed methodology expands the chemical space at the anomeric position of fucose and supports future applications in glycomimetics design.

The anomeric position of carbohydrates is a privileged site for structural diversification in the development of glycomimetics. Quaternization of the anomeric carbon represents a promising strategy to enable dual and orthogonal functionalization at C&#8208;1, while preserving critical binding features. Herein, the synthesis of novel bifunctional C&#8208;fucoside scaffolds, bearing a quaternary anomeric center, is reported. The strategy employs radical bromination of &#946;&#8208;cyano and &#946;&#8208;carbomethoxy fucosides to access key anomeric &#945; (axial) bromide intermediates, which enable downstream derivatization via azide substitution or C&#63743;C bond formation through radical allylation. The latter reaction occurs with high &#945; (axial) selectivity from the &#946;&#8208;carbomethoxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fucosyl bromide, while mixtures are obtained from the corresponding &#946;&#8208;cyano derivative. Azide substitution occurs with full inversion of configuration starting from both bromides. While attempts at amide coupling are hampered by anomeric epimerization, copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition proceeds efficiently, yielding &#945;&#8208;C,&#946;&#8208;N&#8208;fucosides with high yields and selectivity. The developed methodology expands the chemical space at the anomeric position and supports future applications in ligand design, multivalent systems, and carbohydrate&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Advances in Organoboron&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Glycosylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article focuses on the advancements in utilizing boron&#8208;based organocatalysts, specifically organoboranes and boronic acids, in glycosylation reactions. It highlights how these organocatalysts are being used to enhance the efficiency as well as the scope of regio&#8208; and stereoselective glycosylation, a crucial process in the synthesis of complex carbohydrates and glycoconjugates.

The efficient and stereoselective formation of glycosidic bonds remains a long&#8208;standing challenge in carbohydrate chemistry, particularly in the synthesis of complex glycans, while conventional chemical methods often involve metal&#8208;based catalysts and require harsh reaction conditions, which result in reduced chemo&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and sometimes regiocontrol, particularly as chemical complexity in the substrates increases. In recent decades, organocatalysis has been a revolutionary approach, which offers sustainable and selective glycosylation strategies. Among the various organocatalysts explored, organoborons have demonstrated exceptional promise as mild and versatile activators of glycosylation reactions and for controlling the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity. This review highlights the recent advances in the use of boron&#8208;based organocatalysts, specifically organoboranes and boronic acids, in glycosylation reactions. Herein, the focus is placed on their mechanistic roles as Lewis acids, their interactions with hydroxyl&#8208;containing substrates, and their ability to modulate regioselectivity and stereoselectivity. Key contributions of boronic acids and organoboranes in promoting 1,2&#8208;cis and 1,2&#8208;trans glycosidic linkages, activating various classes of glycosyl donors, and enabling regio&#8208; and stereoselective transformations under mild conditions are critically examined. It is divided into two main sections: the first part focuses on the highly Lewis&#8208;acidic borane B(C6F5)3 catalyzed glycosylation, and the second part discusses RB(OH)2&#8208;based glycosylation and its potential for future research.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of 9&#8208;Fluorenone&#8208;Benzothiadiazole&#8208;Based Donors: Synergistic Optimization of Photovoltaic Properties in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
9&#8208;Fluorenone(FN) and benzothiadiazole units have become important building blocks for organic solar cells (OSCs) due to their excellent charge transport prperties, strong electron affinity, and planar molecular structures. However, the 9&#8208;fluorenone&#8208;benzothiadiazole (FN&#8208;BT) system suffers from poor solubility and insufficient light absorption, limiting its photovoltaic performance. To overcome these challenges, three novel small&#8208;molecule donors (SMDs) are developed: two asymmetric (TPAFNBT and TPAFNDOBT) and one symmetric (TPAFN)2DOBT, based on their molecular framework. Side&#8208;chain modifications and &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension are investigated the effect on device performance. The symmetric donor (TPAFN)2DOBT shows particularly promising properties, with extended absorption and an optical bandgap of 1.93 eV. The introcuced alkyl side chains significantly improved material processability and film quality. Notably, (TPAFN)2DOBT&#8208;based devices achieve a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.09 V coupled with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.25%, representing the highest efficiency reported for solution&#8208;processed FN&#8208;BT photovoltaic systems. This work demonstrates that molecular engineering through strategic side&#8208;chain design and &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension can effectively enhance the performance of SMDs. These findings provide valuble design principles for developing advanced active layer materials in organic photovoltaic.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 28, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we report a mild and efficient photoredox&#8208;catalyzed dioxygenation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes with alcohols, preserving both fluorine atoms and resulting in the formation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers. This approach is operationally simple, utilizes inexpensive and widely available reagents, and showcases broad functional group compatibility. Preliminary mechanistic investigations point to a radical&#8208;mediated mechanism, which involves a concerted SN2&#8208;like ring&#8208;opening functionalization.







Abstract
gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes are valuable synthetic intermediates in organofluorine chemistry; however, their reactivity often involves intermediates prone to fluorine elimination, leading to monofluorinated products. Here, we present a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed dioxygenation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes with alcohols, which retains both fluorine atoms and yields &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers. This method is operationally simple, employs inexpensive and standard reagents, and demonstrates broad functional group tolerance. The reaction is scalable, enabling the use of the gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropane motif as a masked precursor for &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers in synthetic sequences. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest a radical&#8208;mediated process involving concerted SN2&#8208;like ring&#8208;opening functionalization.

Here, we present a photoredox-catalyzed dioxygenation of &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluorocyclopropanes with alcohols, which retains both fluorine atoms and yields &#945;,&#945;-difluorinated-1,3-diethers. This method is operationally simple, employs inexpensive and standard reagents, and demonstrates broad functional group tolerance. The reaction is scalable, enabling the use of the gem-difluorocyclopropane motif as a masked precursor for &#945;,&#945;-difluorinated-1,3-diethers in synthetic sequences. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest a radical-mediated process involving concerted S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2-like ring-opening functionalization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A photoinduced radical cascade that does not require a photocatalyst or an oxidant has been developed for the convenient synthesis of difluoromethylated dihydroisoquinolones by the use of a difluoromethyl phenoxathiinium salt. The reaction features mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, high yields, and good functional&#8208;group tolerance.

A mild photocatalyst&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free photoinduced reaction for the convenient synthesis of difluoromethylated dihydroisoquinolones from N&#8208;allylbenzamides with a difluoromethyl phenoxathiinium salt (CF2H&#8208;PXT+) is presented, which involves a radical difluoromethylation/cyclization cascade process with broad substrate scope and good functional&#8208;group tolerance. Using this method, a broad range of N&#8208;allylbenzamides are successfully converted to the desired difluoromethylated dihydroisoquinolones in good to high yields.

         <title>Facilitating the Isolation of Polar Natural Products: Mild 1,1&#8242;&#8208;Carbonyldiimidazole&#8208;Enabled Method for Derivatization of Acids and Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 28, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, 1,1&#8242;&#8208;carbonyldiimidazole, a relatively inexpensive reagent with inherently low toxicity, is utilized to activate polar natural products containing carboxylic acids and alcohols to enable the formation of less polar species (N&#8208;acylimidazoles and N&#8208;acyloxymidazoles). These intermediates are readily converted into methyl esters and carbonates by treatment with methanol.

Many secondary metabolites containing carboxylic acid and alcohol functional groups are highly polar and can be difficult to purify and isolate from complex extracts obtained from natural sources. The conversion of these natural products to their corresponding alkyl esters/carbonates under mild conditions can simplify their purification and isolation. However, traditional derivatization methods have often relied on toxic and/ or corrosive reagents that can also lead to byproduct formation or epimerization in some instances.

These intermediates are readily converted into methyl esters and carbonates by treatment with methanol. It is anticipated that this rather simple and versatile derivatization method can facilitate the efficient isolation of secondary metabolites bearing polar carboxylic acid and alcohol residues.

         <title>Selective Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Photoredox &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8211;H Alkynylation of Cyclic Amines under Visible Light</title>

A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8211;H alkynylation of cyclic amines is developed using [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2&#183;6H2O as a photocatalyst and 1&#8208;bromoalkynes as coupling partners. The method enables the efficient synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aminoalkynes with moderate to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies suggest a radical pathway initiated by single&#8208;electron transfer, and the protocol is scalable under mild photoredox conditions.

A direct visible&#8208;light &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8211;H bond alkynylation of N&#8208;aryl pyrrolidine derivatives with 1&#8208;bromoalkynes has been developed, enabling the synthesis of propargylic amines. This transformation utilizes [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2&#183;6H2O as a photocatalyst, driven by blue LED (455&#8201;nm) irradiation. Detailed mechanistic studies and cyclic voltammetry support the proposed reaction pathway, where the C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp) bond formation occurs via the oxidation of &#945;&#8208;amino radicals, followed by a radical coupling with 1&#8208;bromoalkynes. This approach offers a straightforward, efficient, and selective method for synthesizing a wide range of cyclic &#945;&#8208;aminoalkynes, yielding moderate to good yields.

         <title>Alkyne&#8208;Dependent Synthesis of Pyrrolines and Propargylamines through Metal&#8208;Free Decarboxylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 28, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free multicomponent decarboxylative reaction has been developed, enabling the highly regioselective and efficient synthesis of various pyrrolines and propargylamines. The approach is environmentally benign, readily implemented, and tolerates a wide range of functional groups.

Pyrrolines are crucial in the discovery and development of pharmaceuticals. Herein, a metal&#8208;free multicomponent decarboxylative reaction has been developed that is extremely effective and brief. The reaction is performed to form iminium salt intermediates through decarboxylative condensation of N&#8208;benzylglycines and formaldehyde. Subsequent chemoselective [3 + 2] cyclization or nucleophilic addition of alkynes leads to the generation of various pyrrolines or propargylamines in moderate to good yields, respectively. The approach is environmentally benign, easily implemented, and tolerates a wide range of functional groups.

         <title>Green Synthesis of Hantzsch Dihydropyridines from Biorenewable Furans Derived from Lignocellulosic Biomass</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 28, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable methodology is developed for the synthesis of dihydropyridines from furanic aldehydes derived from lignocellulosic biomass, using p&#8208;sulfonic calix[4]arene as a catalyst and microwave irradiation heating. The reaction occurs in the absence of solvents, with short reaction time and satisfactory yields. Twenty one compounds are obtained, seven of which are reported for the first time. Catalyst reusability is demonstrated.

Hantzsch dihydropyridines constitute a class of N&#8208;heterocycles with significant pharmacological and technological applications. Due to their importance, the development of new sustainable synthetic methodologies for producing dihydropyridines is of great interest. This work presents the synthesis of dihydropyridines via the Hantzsch multicomponent reaction. Furanic aldehydes derived from lignocellulosic biomass are used as substrates, and p&#8208;sulfonic acid calix[4]arene (CX4SO3H) is employed as an organocatalyst, under microwave irradiation (MWI). The furanic compounds are reacted with ethyl acetoacetate and ammonium acetate in the presence of 1.0&#8201;mol% of CX4SO3H for 10&#8201;min at 80&#8201;&#176;C under MWI. Twenty one dihydropyridines are synthesized in yields ranging from 43% to 96%. Two dihydropyridines are obtained as crystals suitable for X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and their crystallographic data are provided. Moreover, the catalytic system can be reused for seven reaction cycles without significant yield loss. The developed methodology offers numerous advantages. It enables the production of dihydropyridines from renewable substrates via a multicomponent reaction in a single step, with a short reaction time.

     alt="Green Synthesis of Hantzsch Dihydropyridines from Biorenewable Furans Derived from Lignocellulosic Biomass"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sustainable methodology is developed for the synthesis of dihydropyridines from furanic aldehydes derived from lignocellulosic biomass, using &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-sulfonic calix[4]arene as a catalyst and microwave irradiation heating. The reaction occurs in the absence of solvents, with short reaction time and satisfactory yields. Twenty one compounds are obtained, seven of which are reported for the first time. Catalyst reusability is demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hantzsch dihydropyridines constitute a class of N-heterocycles with significant pharmacological and technological applications. Due to their importance, the development of new sustainable synthetic methodologies for producing dihydropyridines is of great interest. This work presents the synthesis of dihydropyridines via the Hantzsch multicomponent reaction. Furanic aldehydes derived from lignocellulosic biomass are used as substrates, and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-sulfonic acid calix[4]arene (CX4SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H) is employed as an organocatalyst, under microwave irradiation (MWI). The furanic compounds are reacted with ethyl acetoacetate and ammonium acetate in the presence of 1.0&#8201;mol% of CX4SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H for 10&#8201;min at 80&#8201;&#176;C under MWI. Twenty one dihydropyridines are synthesized in yields ranging from 43% to 96%. Two dihydropyridines are obtained as crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis, and their crystallographic data are provided. Moreover, the catalytic system can be reused for seven reaction cycles without significant yield loss. The developed methodology offers numerous advantages. It enables the production of dihydropyridines from renewable substrates via a multicomponent reaction in a single step, with a short reaction time. The process uses a reusable organocatalyst and eliminates the need for solvents or metal catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning Gramicidin S: How &#948;&#8208;Phenylproline Affects Turns and Interaction with Membrane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 28, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing a phenyl group at the 5&#8208;cis position of proline in gramicidin S markedly alters its conformation. This substitution induces a double &#947;&#8208;turn that disrupts the native &#946;&#8208;sheet and hinders membrane insertion.

The incorporation of a phenyl ring at the 5&#8208;position of proline markedly influences the conformation and membrane interactions of gramicidin S. Herein, the structural and biophysical consequences of introducing cis&#8208;5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;L&#8208;proline into gramicidin S are computationally investigated, with a particular focus on its conformational behavior and lipid bilayer interactions. Using a homochiral model dipeptide, it is shown that cis&#8208;5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;L&#8208;proline promotes the formation of a double &#947;&#8208;turn, significantly altering the peptide's folding characteristics. This conformational bias is transferred to the modified gramicidin S scaffold, where it perturbs the native amphipathic balance and results in less favorable membrane interactions. These findings underscore the pivotal role of proline&#8208;derived modifications in shaping the structural and functional properties of cyclic peptides and offer valuable insights into how targeted substitutions can modulate peptide&#8211;membrane interactions.

         <title>Ecofriendly Borylation of Allylic Acetates via Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Dual&#8208;Role Base Activation</title>

         <dc:description>
A glovebox&#8208;free, scalable Ni&#8208;catalyzed borylation of allylic acetates using cost&#8208;effective reagents and a recyclable ligand is presented. The reaction proceeds in EtOAc with a dual&#8208;role base, delivering a diverse range of allylic boronates in yields up to 97%.

Allylic boronates are valuable synthons in organic chemistry, making the development of efficient and sustainable preparation methods highly desirable. A nickel&#8208;catalyzed borylation of unactivated allylic acetates using a recyclable N&#8208;donor ligand system in ethyl acetate is reported. The method employs an innovative dual&#8208;role base that simultaneously activates diboron reagents and reduces air&#8208;stable NiBr2, eliminating the need for external reductants. The approach shows excellent compatibility across a diverse array of substrates, delivering the desired products with isolated yields up to 97%. Its operational simplicity is evidenced by glovebox&#8208;free conditions and successful multigram&#8208;scale implementation (13&#8201;mmol scale, yields up to 95%), underscoring the method's practicality as a ecofriendly alternative to conventional allylic borylation.

         <title>Formal Higher&#8208;Order [8 + 3] Cycloaddition of Azaheptafulvenes with Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 28, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formal higher&#8208;order [8+3] cycloaddition of azaheptafulvenes with donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes is developed to access cyclohepta[b]pyridines, exhibiting broad substrate accommodation. The nucleophilic cyclopropane ring opening is a key process of the [8+3] cycloaddition, and most probably proceeds via a &#8220;exploded&#8221; SN2 transition state with a high degree of carbocation character.

Cyclohepta[b]pyridine derivatives have attracted significant attention owing to their unique bioactivities. Herein, the authors describe an efficient method to access various cyclohepta[b]pyridine derivatives through formal higher&#8208;order [8&#8201;+&#8201;3] cycloaddition of azaheptafulvenes with donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes catalyzed by Yb(OTf)3. This method exhibits broad substrate accommodation and gives the corresponding products in high yields and selectivity.

The first synthesis of pentafluorosulfanylated oxazoles has been developed. They are prepared using a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization of SF5&#8208;alkynes and nitriles.

This work reports the first synthesis of pentafluorosulfanylated oxazoles through a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of SF5&#8208;alkynes and nitriles. It describes 18 examples of 4&#8208;SF5&#8208;oxazoles with NMR yield ranging from 3% to 75%. While the isolation of the pure pentafluorosulfanylated oxazoles proves challenging, the fluorinated heterocycles can nonetheless be obtained in yields between 14% and 52%, opening the door for their use as a novel fluorine&#8208;containing scaffold.

         <title>Reaction of Nitrones with Phosphinylallenes: DFT Mechanistic Investigations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 28, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of the reaction between phosphinylallenes and nitrones is investigated by DFT calculations to elucidate the overall pathway and the stereochemical outcome. The initial (3+2) cycloaddition delivers an unstable isoxazolidine ylidene intermediate, spontaneously rearranging to the 4&#8208;phosphinylpyrrolidin&#8208;3&#8208;one via a radical pathway. This study describes the successive reaction steps and shows how conformational and steric effects influence selectivity.

The reaction between phosphinylallenes and nitrones efficiently leads to 4&#8208;phosphinylpyrrolidin&#8208;3&#8208;ones. The mechanism of this transformation is investigated theoretically to elucidate the overall pathway and the stereochemical outcome. The process begins with a (3+2) cycloaddition between the nitrone and the allene, delivering an isoxazolidine ylidene intermediate. This intermediate has never been isolated; it spontaneously rearranges to the final 4&#8208;phosphinylpyrrolidin&#8208;3&#8208;one via homolytic cleavage of the N&#63743;O bond, followed by rotation and C&#63743;N recombination of the biradical intermediate.

     alt="Reaction of Nitrones with Phosphinylallenes: DFT Mechanistic Investigations"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanism of the reaction between phosphinylallenes and nitrones is investigated by DFT calculations to elucidate the overall pathway and the stereochemical outcome. The initial (3+2) cycloaddition delivers an unstable isoxazolidine ylidene intermediate, spontaneously rearranging to the 4-phosphinylpyrrolidin-3-one via a radical pathway. This study describes the successive reaction steps and shows how conformational and steric effects influence selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reaction between phosphinylallenes and nitrones efficiently leads to 4-phosphinylpyrrolidin-3-ones. The mechanism of this transformation is investigated theoretically to elucidate the overall pathway and the stereochemical outcome. The process begins with a (3+2) cycloaddition between the nitrone and the allene, delivering an isoxazolidine ylidene intermediate. This intermediate has never been isolated; it spontaneously rearranges to the final 4-phosphinylpyrrolidin-3-one via homolytic cleavage of the N&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O bond, followed by rotation and C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N recombination of the biradical intermediate. The computational results provide valuable insights for achieving diastereo- and enantioselective synthesis of 4-phosphinylpyrrolidin-3-ones through careful selection of substituents on the nitrone and allene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Amphiphilic Naphthalenediimides and Investigation of their Bioimaging Potential in Large Unilamellar Vesicles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 28, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient synthesis of a small library of nonsymmetrical panchromatic naphthalenediimides is reported. The electron&#8208;donating groups on the aromatic core are varied to tune the fluorophores' photophysical properties . The ability of the dyes to partition and light up inside the lipid bilayer membrane in liposomal models is investigated to evaluate key features for designing compact tracers for cell membrane staining.

New fluorescent probes for bioimaging outlook are constantly required to in&#8208;depth elucidate relevant biochemical processes and macrodomains. Among them, the targeted imaging of cellular membranes is of high importance due to their complex biochemical function. In this work, a small library of amphiphilic core&#8208;substituted 1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenediimides (cNDIs) has been synthesized and investigated. This approach aims to evaluate how fluorophores with the same molecular structure and hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance but bearing different small structural moieties, needed to tune their optical features, can stain the lipid bilayer membrane in large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) as cell membrane models. The photophysical properties and the partition kinetic into different LUVs have been analyzed with respect to the probe structure and the specific photophysical traits related to cNDIs core substitution spanning the whole visible spectrum. The obtained results and preliminary cell imaging analyses represent versatile key data to support the design of new amphiphilic fluorescent sensors for bioimaging.

An efficient method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;fluorobenzamides is established from 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazinone using tetrafluoroboric acid under thermal and photochemical conditions.

An efficient method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;fluorobenzamides is established from 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazinones using tetrafluoroboric acid. The reactions proceed under mild thermal conditions, providing a wide range of functionalized 2&#8208;fluorobenzamides in 65%&#8211;80% yields. On the other hand, the reaction proceeds with 58%&#8211;63% yields at room temperature under visible light using blue LED conditions. Simple operation, metal&#8208;free conditions, and broad substrate scope are the benefits of the developed methodology.

Four rhodanine&#8208;derived conjugated systems, incorporating N,N&#8208;diphenylamine and extended with furan or thiophene, undergo glycosylation at the rhodanine nitrogen atom with yields up to 49% in 5 steps. The optoelectronic properties remain unaffected by the presence of glucose. Devices fabricated using the synthesized materials blended with PC71BM in a bulk heterojunction configuration clearly exhibit a photovoltaic effect.

Rhodanine&#8208;derived conjugated systems, incorporating N,N&#8208;diphenylamine and extended with either furan or thiophene, are glycosylated through the nitrogen atom of the rhodanine ring. The optoelectronic properties of these dyes are investigated, revealing that the presence of glucose does not negatively impact their beneficial properties. Additionally, solar cells are built using these systems, demonstrating their photovoltaic capabilities.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced C&#9472;S Bond Formation Catalyzed by the Organic Photocatalyst Eosin Y</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 28, July 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, the formation of C&#9472;S bonds promoted by organic photosensitizer eosin Y under visible light has attracted great interest and attention among chemists. This article reviews the research results on the formation of C&#9472;S bond promoted by organic photocatalyst eosin Y under visible light since 2015, and discusses representative examples and reaction mechanisms.

The development of green and efficient C&#9472;S bond formation methods has received significant attention from synthetic chemists because the C&#9472;S bonds widely occurs in many important drugs and natural biological compounds. In recent years, photochemical organic conversion promoted by visible light has attracted the interest of many organic chemists. Compared with the traditional methods, visible light as the photoredox catalysis of renewable energy has been proved to be a mild and powerful tool that can promote the activation of organic molecules through the single electron transfer process. Therefore, this strategy has been widely applied in the formation of C&#9472;C and C&#9472;heteroatom bonds. This article reviews the research results on the formation of carbon sulfur bond promoted by organic photocatalyst Eosin Y under visible light in recent years, and discusses representative examples and reaction mechanisms.

         <title>Multistep Reactions Initiated by Amine&#8208;Based Organometallic Methods</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advent of C&#8211;H activation and other organometallic methodologies making use of transient directing groups or free amines themselves for the elaboration of amine substrates provides unique access to cascade&#8208;type reactions that can generate significant molecular complexity in one pot.

The pursuit of atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical pathways to access complex heterocycles and functionalized scaffolds has driven advances in the use of transient and free amine directing groups that exploit native coordination properties for multistep synthesis. Traditional protection&#8208;functionalization&#8208;deprotection sequences, while effective in some circumstances, introduce inefficiencies that compound across multistep syntheses. The following strategies address three critical challenges: 1) eliminating auxiliary installation/removal, 2) enabling multistep functionalization without intermediate isolation (in many cases), and 3) maintaining compatibility with sensitive functional groups. This review aims to collectively summarize the developments in amine&#8208;based synthesis that make use of the amine both as a directing group and a reactive partner in subsequent reaction steps. By analyzing mechanistic insights and substrate scope limitations across these methodologies, one can identify unresolved challenges and provide insight on future directions.

         <title>Nucleophilic Substitution of Alkyl Halides with Secondary Phosphine Oxides under Solvent&#8208;Free Conditions for the Synthesis of Tertiary Phosphine Oxides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the green and efficient synthesis of tertiary phosphine oxides, possible self&#8208;induced side reactions can be avoided by replacing trivalent phosphorus esters with secondary phosphine oxides. The resulting transformation has clear advantages over conventional Michaelis&#8211;Arbuzov reactions.

The development of a metal&#8208;free Michaelis&#8211;Arbuzov reaction for green and efficient construction of C&#63743;P(V) compounds represents a significant advancement in organophosphorus synthesis. Herein, a nucleophilic substitution strategy between alkyl halides and secondary phosphine oxides under solvent&#8208; and metal&#8208;free conditions is reported, using sodium iodide as the catalytic promoter. This method provides a facile operation for the synthesis of diverse tertiary phosphine oxides with significant advantages. Firstly, the reaction exhibits broad substrate compatibility, covering a range of aliphatic halides and phosphorus nucleophiles. Secondly, it can be scaled up to the gram level without sacrificing efficiency, and the reaction pathway clearly established through rational studies. Particularly noteworthy is the complete elimination of transition metal catalysts and organic solvents, which aligns with the principles of green chemistry.

         <title>Photocatalytic Decarboxylation of Carboxylic Acids by Iron Catalysis for the Construction of C(sp3)&#63743;O Bonds under Visible Light</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;catalyzed, visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven decarboxylative strategy has been developed for C(sp3)&#63743;O bond formation. This method features broad substrate scope, mild conditions amenable to gram&#8208;scale reactions, and potential for late&#8208;stage functionalization.

The facile construction of C(sp3)&#63743;O bonds holds significant importance in organic synthesis. Herein, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven iron&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylation of alkyl carboxylic acids is reported, enabling C(sp3)&#63743;O bond formation through the trapping of generated alkyl radicals with TEMPO. This method is characterized by its low cost, broad substrate compatibility, and operational simplicity. Not only does it provides an efficient approach to C(sp3)&#63743;O bond construction, but also it demonstrates potential applications in synthetic chemistry through subsequent modifications of TEMPO derivatives.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Alkynylthiolation of Tertiary &#945;&#8208;Carbonyl Bromides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free alkynylthiolation of tertiary &#945;&#8208;carbonyl bromides with 1,2,3&#8208;thiadiazoles. Those reactions involve the in&#8208;situ generation of alkynylthiolate anions from 1,2,3&#8208;thiadiazoles in the presence of a base and then their halogenophilic nucleophilic substitution (SN2X) reactions. The exceptionally mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance highlight the utility of this method to prepare privileged motifs from readily available 1,2,3&#8208;thiadiazoles and tertiary &#945;&#8208;carbonyl bromides feedstocks. Gram&#8208;scale reaction and diverse synthetic transformations convincingly demonstrate the synthetic potential of this method.</dc:description>

         <title>[3]Radialene fluorophores with pH&#8208;switchable emission and stable absorption maxima</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the first push&#8208;pull quino [3]radialene fluorescent dye. Here, the novel bis(dicyanomethylene)&#8208;[3]radialene electron acceptor was connected to a benzimidazole donor. With protonation a substantial red&#8208;shift of fluorescence wavelength is observed, while the absorption maximum remains stable. This process is accompanied with an increased fluorescence quantum yield to about 70%. Further, we explain the findings by a combined experimental and theoretical approach and find that vibronic coupling plays a crucial role. This study highlights the yet unexplored potential of [3]radialene&#8208;based motifs for the design of environment&#8208;responsive fluorophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Diverse &#946;,&#946;&#8208;Diaryl &#946;&#8208;Siloxy Diamines and Application as Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#946;,&#946;&#8208;Diaryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;siloxy diamines were developed as a tunable scaffold for structurally diverse diamine&#8208;based organocatalysts. Synthesis was initiated with the reaction of an oxazolidine methyl ester from L&#8208;serine with various Grignard reagents, introducing a wide range of diaryl substituents at the &#946;&#8208;position. By adjusting the reaction sequence of the silylation and amination steps, the developed synthetic approach enabled the incorporation of diverse aryl, silyl, and amine groups, including cyclic, acyclic tertiary, and secondary amines, into 1,2&#8208;diamines. The resulting diamines were evaluated as catalysts in the enantioselective fluorination of &#946;&#8208;diketones in water using NFSI. Although the yield was similar to that of the conventional catalyst C1, the enantioselectivity was improved, reaching up to 53% ee.</dc:description>

         <title>New Approaches in Catalytic Reactions Using Triphos: A Classical Privileged Ligand |</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past decades multiple catalytic transformations have been feasible due to the application of triphos as ligand. Its particular fac coordination mode to a transition metal center provides a suitable flexibility enabling variation on the coordination mode resulting in metal stabilization. Most of the reported catalytic reactions have been dominated by the use of the ruthenium&#8208;triphos system, either by application of well&#8208;defined complexes or the in situ formed complex. However, in the last years the emergence of cobalt complexes with comparable or even superior catalytic performance than ruthenium have been reported. In this review we have focused on the use of triphos in selected reactions such as N&#8208;alkylation, formic acid dehydrogenation and bond cleavage.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Synthesis of Biogenic CuO Nanoparticles from Agro&#8208;Waste for One&#8208;Pot C&#8211;N Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a simple, green, and cost&#8208;effective method for synthesizing copper oxide nanoparticles (CuONPs) using waste cotton shell (WCS) ash extract, which serves as a natural base (pH 12), replacing conventional inorganic bases. The green&#8208;synthesized CuONPs exhibit excellent catalytic activity in heterogenous catalysis facilitating C&#8211;N bond formation, a key strategy for accessing various bioactive nitrogen heterocycles. TEM analysis reveals spherical morphology of the CuO nanostructure with an average particle size of 15.5 nm. The catalyst efficiently promotes the synthesis of quinoxaline derivatives via cyclization of terminal alkynes and o&#8208;phenylenediamine, offering broad substrate scope (17 quinoxaline derivatives), good yields, and recyclability. This methodology is also applicable to aliphatic terminal alkynes. Additionally, CuONPs also catalyzed the aza&#8208;Michael addition reactions of amines with &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated compounds at room temperature, affording excellent yields. The protocol tolerates a wide range of amines, including acyclic, cyclic (up to seven&#8208;membered rings), primary, secondary, and heterocyclic amines. Synthesis of 14 aza Michael addition products are reported. Furthermore, the CuO nanostructures exhibits high stability and reusability for up to five cycles with minimal loss of activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Bioorthogonal Mycolic Acids: Chemoselective Reduction of &#946;&#8208;Ketoesters Containing an Alkyne Using the Noyori Catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric reduction of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters using the Noyori catalyst is a highly effective synthetic methodology, offering excellent stereocontrol for the preparation of enantiopure b&#8208;hydroxyesters from prochiral substrates in high yields. This reaction has been used in the total synthesis of mycolic acids, which are &#945;&#8208;alkyl, &#946;&#8208;hydroxy fatty acids forming the main part of the mycobacterial cell outer membrane. Recently, the metabolism of mycobacteria has been explored using the chemical reporter strategy with bioorthogonal analogues or precursors of mycolic acids. Introducing a bioorthogonal alkyne into these compounds is a challenging task and particularly valuable for subsequent probe attachment via click chemistry. This work presents approaches for the synthesis of several alkyne&#8208;containing mycolic acids featuring the native structure of natural mycolic acids. The chemoselectivity of the enantioselective reduction of several b&#8208;ketoesters using the Noyori catalyst in the presence of a protected terminal alkyne group was investigated. Conditions have been optimized to ensure that the alkyne remains intact during the reduction process. This study provides valuable tools for further mycomembrane studies using the CuAAC reaction and the optimized conditions extends the possibilities in the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters with an alkyne function.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions in Aqueous Micellar Media</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thanks to their ability to efficiently and reliably construct carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds, cross&#8208;coupling reactions remain at the forefront of chemical research in both academic and industrial settings. However, the growing emphasis on sustainability has exposed the shortcomings of cross&#8208;coupling chemistry in several areas, including the preponderance towards toxic polar aprotic solvents, high loadings of precious metal catalysts, and production of large quantities of waste. In recent years, micellar reaction media, formed by dissolution of surfactant molecules in water, have emerged as a sustainable alternative to organic solvents, allowing for use of water as the bulk medium while circumventing the usual solubility issues associated with its use. This Review introduces the fundamentals of surfactants for synthesis and summarises recent advances in cross&#8208;coupling chemistry in micellar media, with a focus on improving both sustainability and reaction performance using micellar technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen peroxide &#8208; responsive aminoferrocene prodrugs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aminoferrocene (AF)&#8208;based prodrugs are activated in cancer cells through reactions with H&#8322;O&#8322; and other reactive oxygen species (ROS), generating electron&#8208;rich AF&#8217;s. These, in turn, induce the production of highly toxic O2&#183;&#8208; and HO&#183;, leading to cancer cell death. Effective activation of these prodrugs depends on their ability to target intracellular organelles rich in ROS, as non&#8208;targeted prodrugs are practically inactive. In this study, we replaced the boronic acid pinacol ester&#8212;previously used as a ROS&#8208;trigger&#8212;with an &#945;&#8208;ketoamide fragment, which is more selective and sensitive to H&#8322;O&#8322;. This modification enhanced the anticancer efficacy of untargeted AF prodrugs, reducing the IC&#8325;&#8320; from 23.9&#8211;35.5 &#956;M (previously reported prodrug 13b) to 5&#8211;6.4 &#956;M (new prodrug 2a) in human ovarian cancer A2780 and Burkitt&#8217;s lymphoma BL&#8208;2 cells. Further analysis confirmed that the anticancer effect of 2a is driven by its ability to markedly increase intracellular ROS levels in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aminoferrocene (AF)-based prodrugs are activated in cancer cells through reactions with H&#8322;O&#8322; and other reactive oxygen species (ROS), generating electron-rich AF&#8217;s. These, in turn, induce the production of highly toxic O2&#183;- and HO&#183;, leading to cancer cell death. Effective activation of these prodrugs depends on their ability to target intracellular organelles rich in ROS, as non-targeted prodrugs are practically inactive. In this study, we replaced the boronic acid pinacol ester&#8212;previously used as a ROS-trigger&#8212;with an &#945;-ketoamide fragment, which is more selective and sensitive to H&#8322;O&#8322;.

         <title>Organocatalytic Halogenation&#160;of Aromatic and Heteroaromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The halogenation of aromatic and heteroaromatic systems has attracted considerable attention in recent decades owing to the importance of haloaromatics in biologically relevant compounds and their role as essential building blocks for more complex systems. In recent years, various research groups have explored the challenge of developing new synthetic methodologies for electrophilic halogenation. Nevertheless, these methods continue to encounter several challenges, such as waste products from halogenating agents, toxic or contaminating reagents, and problems with low regioselectivity, with polyhalogenation&#8212;often the predominant side reaction&#8212;occurring in some cases. In this context, organocatalysis has emerged as a promising approach to address these limitations. This review highlights key organocatalytic strategies reported in the last 14 years and discusses experimental aspects, mechanisms, and selectivity issues in chlorination, bromination, fluorination, and iodination of aromatic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Point&#8208;to&#8208;axis optical activity induction in extended, sterically congested chromophoric systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The readily available, modular and electronic circular dichroism (ECD)&#8208;silent derivatives of terephthalaldehyde (the probes) have exhibited an induced optical activity upon condensation with chiral primary amines. The central unit of the probe serves as an amine binder by forming imine bonds and is flanked by two extended chromophoric units (&#8220;the wings&#8221;). Modification of the wings by diphenylamine or carbazole units affects the sterical and spectroscopic properties of the probes. An increase in sterical congestion within the probe core resulted in a change in the mechanism of optical activity induction. In the more congested systems, the point&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transmission from the chiral amine (the inducer) to the chromophoric system led to the adaptation of helical conformation by &#8220;the wings&#8221; and the appearance of non&#8208;zero Cotton effects (CEs) in the low&#8208;energy part of the ECD spectrum. However, the sterically congested probes were sensitive to the chirality of the inducers but relatively indifferent to the differences in their structure. Thus, the chirality of the inducers triggers conformational change towards the thermodynamically preferred conformational diastereoisomer due to the probe's &#8212;1 &#8208; +1 operation scheme.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Singlet&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Substituted Benzo[c]chromeno[4,3,2&#8208;gh]phenanthridines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted environmentally benign synthesis of various 9&#8208;alkylbenzo[c]chromeno[4,3,2&#8208;gh]phenanthridine derivatives in the presence of 5 mol % disodium salt of eosin Y (EY) as photocatalyst is reported from 2&#8208;(7,8,9,10&#8208;tetrahydrobenzo[c]phe&#8208;nanthridin&#8208;6&#8208;yl) phenol derivatives, which were prepared through a three&#8208;component reaction. In the present protocol, EY photosensitized singlet oxygen (&#185;O&#8322;) promotes intramolecular cyclization through an oxidative hetero cross&#8208;coupling reaction, followed by aromatization to provide the final product in a single step, which has not been reported earlier. The mechanism of the reaction was established through DFT calculation and by trapping of the oxygen radical intermediate A with BHT, which was confirmed through 1H, 13C NMR spectra and HRMS. This process forms the highly fused hexacyclic heteroaromatics without requiring any metal catalyst or dehydrogenating agent. This intramolecular photocyclization, through the triplet energy transfer (EnT) process, is a fascinating example of the oxidative coupling reaction via distal sp3&#8208;C&#8208;H.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Directed C&#8211;H Heteroarylation of 2&#8208;Pyridones Using Cyclic Iodonium Ylides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;Pyridone is a crucial building block in bioactive natural products and serves as a vital intermediate for the synthesis of bioactive nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. Recent advancements in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization have enabled the direct modification of 2&#8208;pyridones, circumventing the need for pre&#8208;functionalization. In this study, we report a Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed, C6&#8208;selective C&#8211;H heteroarylation of 2&#8208;pyridones using cyclic iodonium ylides as carbene precursors. The versatility and broad applicability of this method are demonstrated through the efficient synthesis of diverse compounds featuring both 2&#8208;pyridone&#8208;pyridine and cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Escape from Flatland: Pericyclic Reactions and Rearrangements of Diazofluorene with Biarylcyclooctynes for the Generation of Helicene&#8208;Like Phenanthro&#8208;Pyrazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the voyage of two flat, highly unsaturated systems into the third dimension. Specifically, we investigated the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of 9&#8208;diazofluorene with a rapidly growing class of strained dipolarophile&#8212;biarylcyclooctynes. We found that the initial spirocyclic 3H&#8208;pyrazole cycloadducts are isolable, and can be subjected to controllable [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic shifts. These van Alphen&#8211;H&#252;ttel rearrangements generate either the metastable 4H&#8208;pyrazoles&#8212;another spirocyclic fused&#8208;ring system with a highly contorted structure&#8212;or the thermodynamically favored 1H&#8208;pyrazoles. The 1H&#8208;pyrazoles display extended conjugation and can be classified as [5]&#8208;helicenes containing a phenanthro&#8208;pyrazole fused to a dihydro&#8208;cyclooctatetraene. Overall, these studies provide a modular framework to control heteroatom placement, ring size, and ring fusion in the syntheses of carbon&#8208;rich materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated Silyl Esters and Silyl Phosphonates Over Cyclopropanation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated silyl esters are an important class of compounds in organic, inorganic and pharmaceutical chemistry, known for their versatility and unique reactivity. The conjugated system in these compounds enables for Michael addition reactions, making them useful intermediates in the synthesis of complex organic/inorganic molecules, including pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and natural products. Having realized the importance of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated silyl esters, we have devised a strategy to synthesize various functionalized allyl and vinyl silanes using diazo compounds and respective silanes. Herein we have demonstrated that the allyl and vinyl silanes can react with diazo compounds in a chemoselective manner offering a versatile method for constructing C&#8208;C bond formation over the cyclopropanation reaction in the presence of 1 mol% of [Cp*RuCl2]n as a catalyst under mild conditions. Direct C&#8208;H bond functionalization of allyl and vinyl silanes with alpha diazo esters and phosphonate diazo showcasing the adaptability of silicon&#8208;based chemistry in modern organic synthesis. The plausible mechanism of the reaction has been realized with the help of DFT calculations. All the synthesized &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated siliyl esters were isolated and characterized by using sophisticated analytical and spectroscopic techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorus Heterocycles for Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds exhibit significant potential for applications in electroluminescence, owing to their distinctive electronic structures and varied chemical properties. Phosphorus heterocycles serve multifunctional roles within organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), including as emitters, host matrices, and electron and hole blocking layers, contributing to enhanced device performance. Their intrinsic structural characteristics confer key advantages, including superior thermal stability, high fluorescence quantum yields, and suitable energy level alignment, all of which are essential for optimizing electroluminescent efficiency. Herein, we overview recent progress of electroluminescent phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocyclics materials and discuss their structure property relationships, which would provide insights into expanding the applicability of OLEDs.</dc:description>
