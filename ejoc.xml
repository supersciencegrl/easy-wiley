         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Dendrimer&#8208;Like Oligoguanidines and Their Use in a Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 5, February 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the synthesis and redox properties of the first redox&#8208;active dendrimer&#8208;like oligoguanidines are reported. One of the compounds is then applied, in its oxidized state, in a representative aryl&#8208;aryl coupling reaction.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;active organic dendrimers are of interest for a variety of applications, e.&#8201;g. as components in optoelectronic devices and energy&#8208;storage (battery) materials, and were also used to model enzymatic reactivity. Here, we report the first synthesis of redox&#8208;active dendrimer&#8208;like oligoguanidines, assembling six or twelve guanidino groups attached to aromatic cores in one molecule. The novel oligoguanidines, being strong electron donors, are characterized in their stable (neutral and dicationic) redox states. Redox processes occur preferrentially at the core, while the periphery provides highly Br&#248;nsted basic sites. The combined electron and proton acceptor properties of the molecules in their stable oxidized dicationic redox state motivate applications in proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes. In this work, we test their application in a representative intramolecular oxidative aryl&#8208;aryl coupling reaction.

         <dc:description>
An electrochemically and catalytically regulated chemoselective C&#8722;S bond coupling reaction for the production of aryl sulfides and sulfones is reported.







Abstract
This work describes an electrochemical enabled nickel&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective C&#8722;S bond coupling protocol for the production of aryl sulfides and sulfones. By simply switching the nickel catalysts and electrodes, this electrochemical C&#8722;S bond coupling has demonstrated excellent redox activity, scalability and sustainability. Furthermore, the mechanism for this electrochemical cross&#8208;coupling reaction has been investigated.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Cascade Annulation Approach for Modular Assembly of Alkynyl/Benzoyl Functionalized Quinolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 5, February 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise and efficient method for the synthesis of alkynyl/benzoyl&#8208;functionalized quinolines through TfOH&#8208;promoted cascade 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition/intramolecular annulation/aromatization process is established.







Abstract
A concise and efficient synthetic method for alkynyl quinolines through TfOH&#8208;promoted cascade 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition/intramolecular annulation/aromatization process is established. By virtue of reactive aza&#8208;o&#8208;AQM (in&#8197;situ generated from modular propargylamine), this reaction proceeds smoothly to afford a variety of alkynyl quinolines in good to excellent yields. This transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free process features halogen groups tolerance, such as the &#8722;Cl, &#8722;Br, and &#8722;I groups; thus, this protocol circumvents the inherent shortcomings of the existing Sonogashira coupling of halogenated quinolines.

         <title>Synthesis of Azido&#8208;Dienediols by Enzymatic Dioxygenation of Benzylazides: An Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 5, February 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A study on the Winstein rearrangement on substituted azidodienediols is presented. Substrates bearing a methyl group at the ortho or meta position produced exclusively rearranged exo&#8208;diendiols, while in the case of para methyl substrates, an equilibrium mixture of rearranged and non&#8208;rearranged products was observed. Finally, chloro substituents in the diene moiety completely prevented the Winstein rearrangement to take place.







Abstract
Allylic azides are versatile structural motifs in organic synthesis because the proximal double bond enables a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement, named as the Winstein rearrangement. In this work, an experimental and theoretical study on the double Winstein rearrangement occurring in azidodienediols derived from the biocatalytic dihydroxylation of substituted benzylazides is presented. Substrates bearing a methyl group at the ortho or meta position produced exclusively rearranged exo&#8208;diendiols with the azide group anti to the diol moiety as the major constituent. In the case of para methyl substrates, an equilibrium mixture of rearranged and non&#8208;rearranged products was observed, indicating that a full conversion to the exo&#8208;dienediols is not possible within this substitution pattern. On the other hand, the presence of a chloro substituent in the diene moiety completely precluded the Winstein rearrangement to take place, giving rise exclusively to the traditional cis&#8208;cyclohexadienediols. The observed results were analyzed to determine the mechanistic and kinetic aspects and scope limitations of the reaction as a synthetic tool.

         <title>Photochemistry at Scale: Wireless Light Emitters Drive Sustainability in Process Research &amp; Development</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 5, February 4, 2022. </description>

Our study demonstrates a seamless scale&#8208;up of photochemical C&#8722;C&#8208;cross&#8208;couplings of aryls and alkyls via dual Ir/Ni photoredox catalysis. The herein described novel type of internal illumination using wirelessly powered LEDs inside the reaction media allows for efficient scaling and intensification of those reactions, maintaining virtually identical reaction profiles over all scales. The system is readily applicable to other light&#8208;driven reactions as well.







Abstract
Carbon&#8722;carbon bond formation by dual Iridium&#8208;Nickel photoredox catalysis has gained a lot of attention for late&#8208;stage cross&#8208;couplings of alkyls with aryls. However, the scalability of such reactions is greatly impeded by the poor light penetration depth into the strongly absorbing reaction media. Wireless internal illumination is a novel technique which circumvents the light penetration issue efficiently and therefore allows to scale photon&#8208;driven reactions by conventional methods. Here we demonstrate that industrially relevant photoredox C&#8722;C couplings can be scaled seamlessly to different volumes, achieving qualitatively and quantitatively the same results at all scales. The use of conventional reactor types allows stirred, bubble column or fixed&#8208;bed operation mode and is fully compatible with heterogeneous reaction mixtures. By minimizing reflection losses, we could also show a significant advantage in the reaction rate over an externally illuminated setup at the same light intensity.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Reactions Controlled by Ring&#8208;Chain Tautomerism of 2&#8208;Formylbenzoic Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 5, February 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A broad range of dynamic covalent reactions was developed from ring&#8208;chain tautomers of 2&#8208;formylbenzoic acid and N&#8208;, O&#8208;, and S&#8208;mononucleophiles. The neighboring carboxyl group plays a crucial role in thermodynamic stabilization and kinetic activation. The reversibility was proved through component exchange, and substrate selectivity was also modulated. The mechanistic insights revealed pave the way for future design.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) is an intensive area of research as it has found utility in the creation of molecular assemblies, complex systems, and ordered frameworks. Herein we demonstrate the development of dynamic covalent reactions (DCRs) of common N&#8208;, O&#8208;, and S&#8208;mononucleophiles by controlling ring&#8208;chain tautomerism of 2&#8208;formylbenzoic acid. The regulation of distinct dual reactivity of interconverting open aldehyde and cyclic hemiacetal forms, the thermodynamic stabilization through chelation and delocalization, as well as the kinetic effect resulting from neighboring group participation, enabled the realization of DCRs of a broad range of alcohols, thiols, primary amines, and secondary amines exhibiting high efficiency and fast equilibrium. The dynamic nature of the system was verified through component exchange, and the switch of DCRs was achieved through the manipulation of substrate selectivity. The investigation of mechanism shed insights on the dependence of reaction pathways on nucleophiles, laying the foundation for future design and application.

         <title>Third Time is a Charm &#8211; Protonating Tricarboxybenzenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 5, February 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tricarboxybenzenes were (tri&#8208;)protonated, resulting in the formation of astonishingly stable species. The different isomers are stabilized by mesomerism and hyperconjugation depending on the substitution pattern. These effects are observable by X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy and also computable by NPA and NICS calculations, enabling qualitative and quantitative statements.







Abstract
Triprotonation of the three constitution isomers of tricarboxybenzene was accomplished. Furthermore, the preparation of selected mono&#8208; and dications showed the sequence of protonation steps. The cations were mostly isolated as [SbF6] and [AsF6] species, which were characterized by Raman and NMR spectroscopy as well as X&#8208;ray structure determination. To further elucidate the experimental results, quantum chemical calculations are employed, especially in regard to charge distribution with NPA charges and aromaticity by NICS(0) values. Thermal decomposition of the compounds was investigated in order to explore the possibility of acyl cation formation. The influence of the aromatic system, substitution pattern and anomeric effect concerning the properties of the respective compounds was thus explained.

         <title>PAHs Containing both Heptagon and Pentagon: Corannulene Extension by [5+2] Annulation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 5, February 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general synthetic method based on hydroboration, electrophilic borylation, dehydrogenation and [5+2] annulation affords molecules with both bowl&#8208; and saddle&#8208;shape and the inclusion of a formal azulene unit. Their optical and electronic properties were studied to elucidate the ramifications of different substituents. Furthermore, their aromaticity was assessed through theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Utilizing Pd&#8208;catalyzed [5+2] annulation a series of heptagon&#8208;extended corannulenes could be synthesized from a borinic acid precursor furnished by C&#8722;H borylation strategy. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed the presence of two conformational enantiomers crystallizing in a racemic mixture. Through their embedded five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered rings these polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) exhibit both negative and positive curvature and UV/Vis/NIR absorption spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry experiments provided insights into the influence of larger flanking aromatic systems and electron&#8208;donating substituents encompassing the heptagonal ring. Through [5+2] annulation of acenaphthylene an azulene&#8208;containing PAH with intriguing optoelectronical properties including a very small bandgap and absorption over the whole visible spectrum could be obtained. Theoretical calculations were employed to elucidate the long&#8208;wavelength absorption and aromaticity.

         <dc:description>
An iodine&#8208;mediated synthesis strategy for rapid synthesis of sulfenamides was reported. By using iodine as oxidant, various thiophenols and amines (mainly secondary amines) could quickly and smoothly proceed the CDC reaction, affording the target N&#8722;S formation products with good yields. The protocol features metal&#8208;free, easy performance, short reaction time, variety of substrates and good yields, showing potential synthetic value for the preparation of a diversity of biologically or pharmaceutically active compounds.







Abstract
A highly efficient and convenient method for the water&#8208;involved synthesis of &#946;&#8208;keto dithiocarbamates has been developed. In the presence of minimal water, the desired products were obtained in good to excellent yields by using thiuram disulfide reagents and substituted &#945;&#8208;haloacetophenones as starting materials. This protocol features high atom economy, mild conditions, good functional tolerance and good to excellent yields, showing potential value for the preparation of some biologically and pharmaceutically active compounds.

         <title>Substituted Malonic Acid Half Oxyesters (SMAHOs): Green Nucleophiles for Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 5, February 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted malonic acid half&#8208;oxyesters constitute an original family of pro&#8208;nucleophiles, which could be used as enolate equivalents in decarboxylative processes. These reagents are particularly well&#8208;suited for the development of organocatalyzed processes, and this strategy has recently led to the development of eco&#8208;compatible olefination and addition reactions.







Abstract
Substituted malonic acid half&#8208;oxyesters (SMAHOs) constitute an original family of malonic acid derivatives. They could be mostly used as pro&#8208;nucleophiles through decarboxylative processes, making them enolate equivalents for the elaboration of greener methodologies. In addition to the native ester function, the presence of a substituent on the malonic position affords additional opportunities for structural diversification. These reagents are particularly well&#8208;suited for the development of organocatalyzed processes, which has recently led to olefination and addition reactions as relevant synthetic routes to elaborated structures under mild conditions.

         <title>Cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;Catalyzed Controllable Pinacol Rearrangement with Activated Hydride Migration</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 5, February 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrobenzoin compounds performed a novel pinacol rearrangement with hydride migration in the presence of cucurbit[7]uril to yield the ketone products selectively.







Abstract
A selective pinacol rearrangement of hydrobenzoin compounds was established through a heterogeneous catalysis strategy in the presence of cucurbit[7]uril. As an unexpected consequence, the ketone was generated as the sole product with the cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;controlled hydride migration under optimized conditions. The five recycled runs suggested the catalytic activity of the cucurbit[7]uril remained. The experimental analysis and DFT calculation disclosed the important role of supramolecular encapsulation of substrates within the cavity of the macrocyclic host to fix the phenyl groups on hydrobenzoin compounds and trigger the hydride migration, therefore, ketone was the prior product.

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;Substituted Indoles by Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Cyclization of 1&#8208;Halo&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzene with Alkynes</title>

         <dc:description>
A tandem addition/reductive cyclization pathway for producing 2&#8208;substituted indoles from 1&#8208;halo&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzene and terminal alkynes is reported for the first time. The direct C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond formation involves a Sonogashira&#8208;type coupling reaction followed by reductive cyclization. The stable and robust dppf ligated Pd dithiolate complex was employed as catalyst and Zn as an inexpensive reductant.







Abstract
An effective process for synthesizing 2&#8208;substituted indoles in a one&#8208;pot tandem reaction of 1&#8208;halo&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzene and terminal alkynes through addition/reductive cyclization is presented. This protocol involves a Sonogashira&#8208;type coupling reaction followed by reductive cyclization employing dppf (1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene) ligated Pd dithiolate complex as a catalyst and Zn as an inexpensive reductant. This efficient and tandem process tolerates broad functional groups with moderate to good yields. The gram&#8208;scale synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted indole has also been demonstrated. This protocol provides an alternative route for the synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted indoles.

         <title>Template Synthesis of Novel Norcorrole Complexes with a Phenyl&#8208;substituted Phosphorus Center</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 5, February 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel norcorrole complexes with a phenyl&#8208;substituted phosphorus center were synthesized as the new examples of norcorrole main&#8208;group element complexes. These phosphorus complexes were found to have aromaticity resulting from the peripheral 18&#8208;electron &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. Moreover, the phenyl&#8208;substituted phosphorus complex exhibited unique optical properties such as a stronger Q&#8208;band than Soret&#8208;band and a fluorescent emission with significantly small Stokes shift.







Abstract
Novel norcorroles complexes with a phenyl&#8208;substituted phosphorus center were synthesized by a template method and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction. It was proved that these new norcorrole phosphorus complexes have aromaticity similar to the very recently reported norcorrole complex with a methoxy&#8208;substituted phosphorus center. This aromaticity results from the peripheral 18&#960;&#8208;system consisting of two methine carbons and four amine&#8208;type pyrrole units with formally pentavalent phosphorus center. On the other hand, these phenyl&#8208;substituted phosphorus complexes showed quite characteristic and strong Q&#8208;band derived from less symmetricity of the molecules than other porphyrinoids.

The two steps were separately optimized for buffer and pH to obtain the expected products.

         <title>Synthesis of Pyranocyclopentaindolines Representing the Western Sections of Janthitrem B, JBIR&#8208;137, and Shearinine&#8197;G</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of pyranocyclopentaindolines: Tetracycles representing the ABCD partial structures of the fungal indole diterpenes janthitrem B, JBIR&#8208;137, and shearinine G were synthesized starting from indoline. The hydroxylated western section of janthitrem B was obtained in eight steps and 10&#8201;% overall yield.







Abstract
The synthesis of the ABCD tetracyclic partial structures of the fungal indole diterpenes janthitrem B, JBIR&#8208;137, and shearinine G is reported. The route starts from 5&#8208;formylated indoline that is coupled to a dihydropyran moiety, followed by Prins cyclization. A diene was obtained that was oxygenated in a divergent manner. The hydroxylated tetracyclic western half of janthitrem B was obtained in eight steps and 10&#8201;% overall yield. We also share our experience with alternative approaches passing via alkynylated precursors. This includes the gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of a 6&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;5&#8208;prenylindoline.

This includes the gold-catalyzed cycloisomerization of a 6-ethynyl-5-prenylindoline.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Acylation of Hexaphenylbenzene for the Synthesis of [5]Cumulenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexaphenylbenzene is appended to [5]cumulenes, a marriage of sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;carbon building blocks for synthetic allotropes.







Abstract
The Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation of hexaphenylbenzene is reported, and the reaction favorably provides the monoacylated products 1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;b. The resulting ketones 1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;b are used as precursors for the formation of [5]cumulenes, including 6&#8201;b in which the sterically demanding HPB moiety affords a diethynyl[5]cumulene that features significant stability (persistence) versus the analog 6&#8201;c which lacks the HPB endgroups. The unsymmetrical substitution pattern of the two most soluble derivatives 6&#8201;b and 6&#8201;c, allows for estimation of rotational barriers for diethynyl[5]cumulenes via VT NMR studies of cis&#8208;trans isomerization. For both molecules, the barrier to rotation is ca. 15&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, which is attenuated in comparison to other [5]cumulenes due to the presence of the ethynyl endgroups.

         <title>Silk&#8722;Fibroin&#8208;Supported Palladium Catalyst for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura and Ullmann Coupling Reactions of Aryl Chlorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silk&#8722;fibroin&#8208;supported palladium catalyst (Pd/SF) was successfully applied in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura and Ullmann coupling reactions of aryl chlorides. Structural investigation of Pd/SF by WAXS analysis, together with the help of a computational model, supported the hypothesis of catalytic pockets where monoatomic Pd species can form stable complexes with SF.







Abstract
Recently, we have reported the preparation of a silk fibroin&#8208;supported Palladium catalyst (Pd/SF) and its use in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of aryl iodides. Since its synthetic applicability and structural features are still far from being fully explored, a deeper investigation is reported here. Pd/SF is tested as a catalyst for the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura and Ullmann coupling reactions of aryl chlorides, in H2O/EtOH solvent mixture under atmospheric conditions. Starting from the analysis of the products of the Pd/SF promoted Ullmann reactions of poly&#8208;haloarenes, we can hypothesize the existence of catalytic pockets where monoatomic palladium species can form stable complexes with SF. To shed light on this hypothesis, Pd/SF is characterized by Wide&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering (WAXS) analysis, which supports the supposition of catalytic pockets. Finally, using a computational model developed by Molecular Mechanic Energy Minimization we have estimated the dimension of the catalytic pocket of Pd/SF (about 15&#8197;&#197;), in good agreement with the experimental results.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Antibiotic Properties of Amino&#8208;Functiona&#173;lized Aromatic Terpenoids Related to Erogorgiaene and the Pseudopterosins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Following a concept of&#160;Hergenrother (Nature&#160; 2017 , 545 , 299) we addresses the question of whether certain antimicrobially active aromatic&#160;natural products can be converted into more potent broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotics by introducing an aminoalkyl side chain. Phenolic mono&#8208; and sesquiterpenoids (incl. carvacrol, xanthorrhizol, and 7&#8208;hydroxycalamenene) as well as the diterpenes 7&#8208;hydroxy&#173;erogor&#173;giaene and 9&#8208;deoxy&#173;pseudo&#173;pterosin A were converted into amino&#8208;functionalized analogs, that display either an amino&#8208;methyl or a 2&#8208;amino&#8208;ethoxy substituent, &#160;by Pd&#8208;catalyzed nitromethylation/reduction of the aryltriflates, by O &#8208;alkylation of the phenols with bromoacetonitrile/reduction, or by ortho &#8208;hydroxymethylation/amination. An efficient enantio&#173;selective total synthesis of 7&#8208;hydroxy&#173;erogorgiaene (8 steps, 29% overall yield) and 9&#8208;deoxy&#173;pseudo&#173;pterosin A (9 steps, 30% overall yield) was elaborated using an asymmetric Co&#8208;catalyzed hydrovinylation (91% ee ) of 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;styrene as the chirogenic step. Other C&#8208;C bond forming steps include a Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling and diastereo&#173;selective Lewis acid&#8208;mediated cyclizations. A total of 16 amino derivatives of natural products were prepared and tested for their antibacterial properties. Some diterpene&#8208;derived amines showed high efficacy against Gram&#8208;positive ( S. aureus SG511, S. aureus HG003, B. subtilis 168; MIC = 0.5 to 2 &#181;g/ml) and&#160;Gram&#8208;negative bacteria&#160;( E. coli K12; E. coli I&#8208;11276b; MIC = 8 to 32 &#181;g/ml).</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Following a concept of&#160;Hergenrother (Nature&#160; 2017 , 545 , 299) we addresses the question of whether certain antimicrobially active aromatic&#160;natural products can be converted into more potent broad-spectrum antibiotics by introducing an aminoalkyl side chain. Phenolic mono- and sesquiterpenoids (incl. carvacrol, xanthorrhizol, and 7-hydroxycalamenene) as well as the diterpenes 7-hydroxy&#173;erogor&#173;giaene and 9-deoxy&#173;pseudo&#173;pterosin A were converted into amino-functionalized analogs, that display either an amino-methyl or a 2-amino-ethoxy substituent, &#160;by Pd-catalyzed nitromethylation/reduction of the aryltriflates, by O -alkylation of the phenols with bromoacetonitrile/reduction, or by ortho -hydroxymethylation/amination. An efficient enantio&#173;selective total synthesis of 7-hydroxy&#173;erogorgiaene (8 steps, 29% overall yield) and 9-deoxy&#173;pseudo&#173;pterosin A (9 steps, 30% overall yield) was elaborated using an asymmetric Co-catalyzed hydrovinylation (91% ee ) of 3-methoxy-4-methyl-styrene as the chirogenic step. Other C-C bond forming steps include a Pd-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling and diastereo&#173;selective Lewis acid-mediated cyclizations. A total of 16 amino derivatives of natural products were prepared and tested for their antibacterial properties. Some diterpene-derived amines showed high efficacy against Gram-positive ( S. aureus SG511, S. aureus HG003, B. subtilis 168; MIC = 0.5 to 2 &#181;g/ml) and&#160;Gram-negative bacteria&#160;( E. coli K12; E. coli I-11276b; MIC = 8 to 32 &#181;g/ml).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Investigations into Supramolecular Lyotropic Liquid Crystals based on 1,3,5&#8208;Benzenetricarboxaramides by NMR&#8208;spectroscopy</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New supramolecular lyotropic liquid crystals (LLC) based on 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxamides (BTAs) with  n  &#8208;alkylaniline sidechains are described. Using NMR spectroscopy we investigate the effects of different chain lengths along the homologous series and of non&#8208;BTA additives on liquid crystalline behaviour. From this, we attempt to answer two questions: First, how aliphatic chain length and the addition of further aromatic rings affect the self&#8208;assembly process in general and compared to previously reported systems with purely aliphatic sidechains. Second, whether or not these modifications are suitable to increases the resulting LLC phases&#8217; resilience against disrupting effects of further, non&#8208;BTA additives.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing medicinally relevant O&#8208;benzofused heterocycles through C&#8208;X activation: Recent trends</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the present review, we address the recent advances in the elaboration of medicinally relevant oxygen benzofused heterocycles by palladium and copper assisted C&#8208;X activation of halo arene precursors. This attractive transformation has shown remarkable versatility and efficiency as a synthetic toolkit leading to the construction of numerous scaffolds with high structural diversity in an atom&#8208;economical manner. We covered recent examples that considered the application of this strategy using miscellaneous coupling partners and conditions. The halo arene motif has proven to be a brilliant candidate principally due to its availability and cost, and in this review, we showcase relevant and appropriate examples of its use in catalytic reactions leading to medicinally important targets.</dc:description>

         <title>Manifestations of Antiaromaticity in Organic Materials: Case Studies of Cyclobutadiene, Borole, and Pentalene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modern synthetic strategies have enabled the proliferation of seemingly unstable antiaromatic species into several molecular and materials applications. These destabilizing moieties offer a unique way of tuning the electronic properties of organic materials. In this Review, the history, synthetic strategies, and applications of important conjugated building blocks based upon the antiaromatic cores of cyclobutadiene, borole and pentalene are explored.







Abstract
This Review surveys the experimental and synthetic history of three classic antiaromatic cores: cyclobutadiene, borole, and pentalene. The coverage extends from the bare molecular cores to fused or substituted variants that impart thermodynamic or kinetic stability to the antiaromatic systems. Recent studies to utilize the unusual properties of these antiaromatic cores in the context of advanced electronic materials are discussed.

This process provided an enantiopure stereolabile &#945;&#8208;bromoketone, which after diastereoselective carbonyl group reduction led to the corresponding anti and syn&#8208;bromohydrins with excellent diastereoselectivities. These bromohydrins can be used as precursors for the synthesis of enantiopure 2&#8208;(1&#8208;Hydroxyalkyl)piperidines. The utility of this methodology was illustrated by the diastereodivergent synthesis of hemlock alkaloid (+)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;conhydrine and its diastereomer (&#8722;)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;conhydrine.







Abstract
Diastereodivergent syntheses of the enantiopure hemlock alkaloid (+)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;conhydrine and its diastereomer (&#8722;)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;conhydrine are reported. Our approach relies on efficient Crystallization&#8208;Induced Diastereomer Transformation (CIDT) of an epimeric mixture of a &#951;,&#947;&#8208;dibromo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketosulfoxide, optically pure only at the sulfur atom, that provided a stable &#945;&#8208;bromoketone, and diastereoselective &#946;&#8208;ketosulfoxide reduction that led to the corresponding anti and syn&#8208;bromohydrins with high level of asymmetric induction.

         <title>Dual Catalysis in Rhodium (II) Carbenoid Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual catalysis represents an alternative archetype in carbene chemistry that surpasses traditional single metal&#8208;catalyst systems. By employing dual catalyst systems, one can improve the efficiency of existing reactions and enable new chemical transformations. Reactions involving dual synergistic catalysis are increasingly valuable as they offer convenient strategies for synthesizing challenging quaternary carbon centers and bioactive core structures. This review article focuses on trapping diazo&#8208;derived, rhodium (II) zwitterionic intermediates with varying electrophiles such as Michael acceptors, alkynes, p&#8208;allyl Pd(II) complexes, and the Nicholas intermediate.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the present paper, we described the efficient enantioselective kinetic resolution (KR) of racemic diastereocontrolled secondary alcohols bearing a quaternary stereocenter using a commercially available chiral isothiourea organocatalyst. This methodology is a general KR leading to the enantiocontrol of acyclic quaternary stereocenter with high levels of stereoselectivity (s up to 185) on a large scope. The hydroxyl function can easily serve as a traceless group by oxidation or reduction process.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic study of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural in Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienaym&#233; reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the present study we explored the reactivity of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (5&#8208;HMF), a renewable platform chemical, as the aldehyde component in the Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienaym&#233; (GBB) multicomponent reaction. Given the limited stability of 5&#8208;HMF under conventional conditions used for this reaction, acidic milieu in combination with high temperature or long reaction times, we explored factors which influence the course of the reaction (solvent, catalyst, time and temperature) within the guidelines of previously reported green reaction conditions. Mild conditions and short reaction times were achieved to obtain good conversion and selectivity values. The reaction scope was exemplified by preparing a small compound library based on the optimized conditions varying the amidine and the isocyanide component. The hydroxymethylfuran moiety present in the GBB products, imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]heterocycles, provides useful functionalization for further transformations, which could expand the diversity of the chemical space.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;catalytic enantioselective synthesis of 1,3&#8208;diols containing a tetrasubstituted fluorinated stereocenter</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enantioselective construction of fluorohydrins featuring a tetrasubstituted stereocenter embedded in complex frameworks represents an important challenge. Herein, we report a multicatalytic strategy enabling the stereoselective preparation of a new type of scaffold containing such challenging fluorohydrin motif. The sequence is based on an organocatalyzed fluorination of &#945;&#8208;disubstituted aldehydes followed by a diastereoselective copper&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative aldol reaction. Reduction of the generated b&#8208;hydroxy ketone followed by a Lewis base&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution enables the isolation of original fluorinated 1,3&#8208;diols with perfect diastereo&#8208; and enantio&#8208;control.</dc:description>

         <title>Isoprostanoids, Isofuranoids and Isoketals &#8208; From Synthesis to Lipidomics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A huge diversity of oxygenated metabolites originated from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) had been discovered discovered. Radical cascades are involved in the biosynthesis of these metabolites, and the radical initiation can be performed either inside the active site of an enzyme in the extracellular medium, or in membrane on phospholipids. The development of convergent and flexible chemical strategies to prepare these compounds by organic chemists, along with the development of sophisticated mass spectrometry methods has boosted the knowledge regarding PUFA metabolites. Also, isoprostanoids have emerged as indicators of oxidative stress in humans and their environment. This review provides a brief overview on the chemical strategies and analytical methods achieved over the past thirty years.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report the synthesis of ferrocene (Fc) conjugated selenopeptides using a new modified solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPSS) protocol and study their self&#8208;assembled nanostructure formation into spheres, nanofibers and nanotubes. We have successfully synthesized four selenopeptide conjugates: two containing both selenocysteine (Sec) and Fc; the rest have either one of the units. These molecules are well&#8208;characterized with various spectroscopic techniques, including 1D and 2D NMR. The importance of Fc unit, aromatic moieties and weak intermolecular interactions on the self&#8208;assembled process is revealed by systematic morphological studies.</dc:description>

         <title>An Improved Protocol for the Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Reaction Allows Unprecedented Broad Synthetic Scope</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the combination of DABCO and acetic acid under solvent&#8208;free conditions, the Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction rate of both activated and non&#8208;activated aldehydes increased significantly. The disclosed procedure is operationally simple and is compatible with a wide array of both nucleophilic and electrophilic reaction partners.







Abstract
The Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) reaction has been stablished as an important C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming transformation between carbonyl&#8208;containing compounds and activated olefins. However, the slow reaction rate usually observed with electron&#8208;rich electrophilic partners hinders a more widespread use of this reaction. In order to overcome this drawback, the effects of several Br&#248;nsted acids on the rate of DABCO&#8208;catalyzed MBH reactions were evaluated. The protocol is operationally simple, involving neat and open&#8208;flask conditions, and is compatible with a wide range of reagents. We suggest a general acid catalysis mechanism to be responsible for the rate increase. The synthetic versatility of the MBH adducts is exemplified with a two&#8208;steps diastereoselective synthesis of the natural product (&#177;)&#8208;sitophilure. We hope this acid&#8208;mediated protocol to have potential use as a general methodology for the MBH reaction.

         <title>The First Total Synthesis of Racemic Chebulic Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Key steps of the total synthesis of racemic chebulic acid are a cerium&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of an &#946;&#8208;oxoester and a cyanide&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;transformation of the respective intermediate product to the &#948;&#8208;lactone structure.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of racemic chebulic acid is reported, which is the aglycon of several antioxidant ingredients of the fruit of the Terminalia chebula tree. The route started with the straightforward preparation of an indanone&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;oxoester from a benzaldehyde derivative (84&#8201;% over the first five steps). The side chain of the target compound was then introduced by conjugated addition of a cuprate reagent derived from dimethyl succinate, which was followed by the first key step of the synthesis: a cerium&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of an &#946;&#8208;oxoester. The second key step was the cyanide&#8208;catalyzed ring transformation of the cyclic &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoester to a &#948;&#8208;lactone. Finally, chebulic acid was obtained after six&#8208;fold demethylation of three methyl ester moieties and three phenolic ether functions. The overall synthetic route consists of nine consecutive steps and was accomplished in 15&#8201;% overall yield.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade and Divergent Synthesis of Indolobenzazepines and Indoloquinolines from Nitrogen&#8208;Tethered 1,8&#8208;Diynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cascade hydroamination and cycloisomerization of nitrogen&#8208;tethered 1,8&#8208;diynes proceeded by cationic Au(I) catalysts. The divergent synthesis of indolo[1,7&#8208;ab]benzazepines and indolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinolines was achieved by the choice of phosphine ligands. The fluorescent aza[6]helicene could also be prepared by this protocol.







Abstract
We describe the divergent construction of two nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic systems by gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerizations. The gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade hydroamination and 7&#8208;endo&#8208;dig&#8208;selective cycloisomerization of nitrogen&#8208;tethered 1,8&#8208;diynes yielded indolo[1,7&#8208;ab]benzazepines in one pot. In contrast, when Johnphos&#8208;coordinated gold catalyst was used, the same 1,8&#8208;diynes were transformed into indolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinolines by 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig&#8208;selective cycloisomerization along with rearrangement of the substituent on one of the alkynes. The reaction of a naphthalene&#8208;tethered substrate provided a helically chiral aza[6]helicene.

&lt;p&gt;Cascade hydroamination and cycloisomerization of nitrogen-tethered 1,8-diynes proceeded by cationic Au(I) catalysts. The divergent synthesis of indolo[1,7-&lt;i&gt;ab&lt;/i&gt;]benzazepines and indolo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]quinolines was achieved by the choice of phosphine ligands. The fluorescent aza[6]helicene could also be prepared by this protocol.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Benzylic Silylation of Diarylmethyl Carbonates with Silylboranes under Base&#8208;Free Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A palladium&#8208;catalyzed benzylic silylation of diarylmethyl carbonates with silylboranes has been developed. The reaction proceeds smoothly even under external base&#8208;free conditions, and the corresponding benzylic silanes are formed in good to high yields. The obtained benzyl silane derivatives can work as the benzylic nucleophiles by the action of a suitable fluoride source and react with some carbon electrophiles to deliver the corresponding benzylic C&#8211;C cross&#8208;coupled products. Additionally, while still preliminary, the allylic silylation of the isoelectronic allylic carbonates is also achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Multispin Systems with a Rigid Ferrocene&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;diyl&#8208;Substituted 1,3&#8208;Diazetidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diimine Coupler: A General Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach to high&#8208;spin molecules with a ferrocenophane core is proposed based on the reaction of intramolecular [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of ferrocene&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;diyl bis(carbodiimide) derivatives formed by the stepwise reaction of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(triphenylphosphoranylidenamino)&#8208;ferrocene with organic isocyanates. The direction of [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition is controlled by substituents in the isocyanates, thereby offering an excellent tool for the creating weakly coupled diradicals.







Abstract
This paper describes the stepwise aza&#8208;Wittig reaction of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(triphenylphosphoranylidenamino)&#8208;ferrocene with a paramagnetic isocyanate, namely, 3&#8208;isocyanato&#8208;2,2,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl, and then with substituted arylisocyanates. The intermediate product (a paramagnetic betaine), which is the product of an intramolecular nucleophilic attack of the nitrogen atom of the iminophosphorane moiety on the carbon atom of the carbodiimide functional group, was isolated and structurally characterized. Subsequent interaction of the betaine with arylisocyanates under mild conditions gave spin&#8208;labeled ferrocenophanes with the 1,3&#8208;diazetidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diimine coupler. It was found that the mutual arrangement of the substituents in the latter depends on the nature of the substituents in the arylisocyanate. Iodophenyl derivatives of 1,3&#8208;diazetidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diimines were cross&#8208;coupled with the gold(I) nitronyl nitroxide&#8208;2&#8208;ide complex, thus yielding diradicals: metallocenophanes functionalized with various types of nitroxide substituents. Molecular and crystal structures of all mono&#8208; and diradicals were solved by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;ethynylphosphonamidate building blocks were used for a chemoselective addition of two thiol&#8208;containing modules in a row to facilitate a simple protocol for the construction of protein&#8208;protein conjugates and homogeneous Antibody&#8208;Drug&#8208;Conjugates (ADCs). A third chemoselective modification step allows a highly modular assembly that yields homogeneous and precise Antibody&#8208;Drug&#8208;Fluorophore&#8208;Conjugates (ADFCs).







Abstract
Bis&#8208;ethynylphosphonamidates allow for a simple chemoselective addition of two thiol&#8208;containing modules in a row. We describe four such bis&#8208;electrophiles that carry different functional O&#8208;substituents with tunable hydrophilicity and enable further subsequent conjugations, thus facilitating a simple protocol for constructing protein&#8208;protein conjugates. An increased spacer length between the two ethynylphosphonamidates simplifies the formation of a conjugate from two bulky proteins. We apply these reagents to obtain homogeneous Antibody&#8208;Drug&#8208;Conjugates (ADCs) from DM1 and trastuzumab with excellent cytotoxicity and selectivity for the targeted cell line. Moreover, a bis&#8208;ethynylphosphonamidate, carrying an additional alkyne for a chemoselective triple conjugation, has been subjected to fluorescent labeling of an ADC specifically at the drug site give an Antibody&#8208;Drug&#8208;Fluorophore&#8208;Conjugate (ADFC), allowing for the observation of intracellular trafficking after ADC uptake into the targeted cell.

         <title>Free&#8208;Radical Epimerization of D&#8208; into L&#8208;C&#8208;(glycosyl)methanol Compounds Using 1,5&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple epimerization of  C&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;Gly  p  )methanol into  C&#8208;(&#946;&#8208;L&#8208;Gly  p  )methanol compounds is described. The radical sequence involved homolytic cleavage of the C5&#8211;H bond by 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer promoted by the 1&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;yl radical and subsequent hydride addition with inversion of configuration. This methodology allows the preparation of rare  C&#8208;(&#946;&#8208;L&#8208;Ido  p  )&#8208;,  C&#8208;(&#946;&#8208;L&#8208;Altp)&#8208;,  C&#8208;(&#946;&#8208;L&#8208;Gulp)&#8208;,  C&#8208;(&#946;&#8208;L&#8208;Allp)methanol glycosides starting from carbohydrates of the  D&#8208;series.

The influence of the sugar ring conformation and the electronegativity of the substituents on the stereochemical outcome will be addressed.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A simple epimerization of  C-(&#945;-D-Gly  p  )methanol into  C-(&#946;-L-Gly  p  )methanol compounds is described. The radical sequence involved homolytic cleavage of the C5&#8211;H bond by 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer promoted by the 1&#8217;-O-yl radical and subsequent hydride addition with inversion of configuration. This methodology allows the preparation of rare  C-(&#946;-L-Ido  p  )-,  C-(&#946;-L-Altp)-,  C-(&#946;-L-Gulp)-,  C-(&#946;-L-Allp)methanol glycosides starting from carbohydrates of the  D-series. It can also be applied to transform  L- into  D-configured  C-glycosyl compounds, as illustrated by the formation of  C-(&#946;-D-6dGulp)- and  C-(&#946;-D-6dAltp)methanol from readily accessible  L-rhamno  and  L-fuco  analogs, respectively. In further development of this procedure compounds with  C-(&#946;-L-Araf)- and  C-(&#946;-L-5dRibf)methanol structures have also been synthesized.

         <title>Theoretical Study on Si&#8210;Cl Bond Activation in Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Chlorosilanes with Organoaluminum</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic cross&#8208;coupling of chlorosilanes has recently emerged as an efficient method for the synthesis of organic silicon compounds. Direct Si&#8210;Cl bond activation by transition metals is a key elementary reaction in these methods. This theoretical study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of activation of the strong Si&#8210;Cl bond in Pd&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction to gain insights for rational catalyst design. Our results suggest two plausible pathways for the bond activation: (i)  trans  &#8208;oxidative addition and (ii) S  N  2&#8208;type oxidative addition assisted by a Lewis acid. With an increase in Cl substituents of chlorosilanes,  trans  &#8208;oxidative becomes highly feasible due to their higher Lewis acidities, in which the facile formation of the Pd&#8594;Si interaction enables the smooth activation of the Si&#8210;Cl bond. The general mechanism of direct Si&#8210;Cl bond activation presented here may prove useful for the rational design of catalysis in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>1,2&#8208;Boryl Migration Enables Efficient Access to Versatile Functionalized Boronates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organoboronates are synthetically useful and highly valuable building blocks in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Two&#8208;electron reactions allow for the rapid construction of organoboronates via nucleophilic 1,2&#8208;boron shift of boron ate complexes or MIDA&#8208;mediated 1,2&#8208;boryl migration. Radical approaches through 1,2&#8208;boron shift of neutral boronic esters or boron ate complexes have been demonstrated to be feasible, providing complementary methods to access these privileged scaffolds. In this minireview, we highlight recent achievements and discuss future opportunities, with an emphasis on different operative modes of catalysis and reaction pathways.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new approach to access 1,3&#8208;diene derived quinolinone compounds has been realized using a mild reaction protocol employing a metal free catalyst (1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene) (4CzIPN), blue LED as activation source and benefits from a sustainable solvent dimethylcarbonate (DMC). The mechanism is postulated as an amide&#8208;tethered enyne intramolecular [2+2]&#8208;photocatalyzed cycloaddition&#8208;retrocycloaddition sequence, proceeding via a cyclobutene intermediate species.

         <title>A Convenient Synthesis of Fluoroalkylated Benzimidazole&#8208; or Indole&#8208;fused Benzoxazines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluoroalkyl group is of particular interest in pharmaceutical chemistry. Since benzimidazole&#8208; or indole&#8208;fused benzoxazines are important motifs in numerous biologically active molecules, the incorporation of a fluoroalkyl group into these molecules may provide more opportunities for drug developments. Herein we describe the first synthesis of fluoroalkylated benzimidazole&#8208; or indole&#8208;fused benzoxazines by using fluoroalkylated propiolates as building blocks. The reactions proceeded smoothly under mild conditions to give the desired products in moderate to high yields. Notably, benzimidazole&#8208;fused products were obtained by a convenient one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step process.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical C&#8722;X/C&#8722;H Functionalization: An Alternative Strategy Access to Pharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the pursuit of clean pharmaceutical production, chemists in the medicinal industry require access to new sustainable methodologies to reduce and even eliminate the pollution generation, which is mainly raised by the overuse of organic solvents, during the chemical synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). In this context, the solvent&#8208;free/less mechanochemical functionalization of small molecules has gradually emerged as a powerful strategy for the green synthesis and modification of APIs, bioactive compounds, and functional materials. In this minireview article, we present an overview of mechanochemical C&#8722;X/C&#8722;H functionalization applications to medicinal chemistry efforts, involving cross&#8208;coupling, cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling, oxidative coupling (via C&#8722;H activation pathway), and direct coupling (via radical pathway) as key steps for the preparation of APIs  and bioactive compounds  .</dc:description>

         <title>Chasing polycyclic natural products: 5/6/5&#8208; or 5/6/6&#8208;carbotricyclic scaffold construction via stereodivergent Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of chiral hydrindanes and their boron complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral  trans&#8208;hydrindanes (bicyclo[4.3.0]nonanes) are important building blocks of polycyclic natural products. In order to access 5/6/5&#8208; and 5/6/6&#8208;carbotricyclic scaffolds scope and limitation of [4+2] cycloadditions of tetrahydroindanones with various dienes were studied. Cyclopentadiene gave a tetracylic  endo&#8208;(R,R)&#8208;diastereomer under acid&#8208;catalysis, whereas &#8232;thermal conditions provided the  endo&#8208;(S,S)&#8208;diastereomer with the opposite diastereofacial &#8232;selectivity. The stereodivergent outcome was rationalized by high&#8208;level quantum&#8208;chemical computations which revealed the acid&#8208;catalysis to be a kinetically controlled reaction and the thermal cycloaddition to be under thermodynamic control. Stereochemical assignment of the cycloadducts was facilitated by conversion of the 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls with BF3&#183;OEt2  into &#8232;BF2&#8208;chelate complexes. Subsequent thermal Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of BF2&#8208; or BBN&#8208;chelates (from 9&#8208;BBN&#8208;OTf) gave  endo  /  exo  &#8208;mixtures of the (R,R)&#8208; and (S,S)&#8208;diastereomers, while more elevated temperatures yielded primarily the  endo/exo&#8208;(S,S)&#8208;diastereomers. Thermal [4+2] cycloadditions with 2,3&#8208;dimethylbutadiene proceeded with lower diastereoselectivity as the &#8232;reaction was kinetically controlled according to calculations. Attempted Diels&#8208;Alder&#8208;reactions with furan gave furyl&#8208;substituted indanones rather than cycloadducts.</dc:description>

         <title>Combination of Asymmetric Organo&#8208; and Biocatalysis in Flow Processes and Comparison with their Analogous Batch Syntheses</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A sequential&#8208;type as well as a tandem&#8208;type chemoenzymatic flow cascade combining an organocatalytic aldol reaction and a biocatalytic reduction to form stereoselectively a 1,3&#8208;diol with two stereogenic centers were developed. Initially, a comprehensive screening of 24 alcohol dehydrogenases was carried out and the identified candidates were applied in different multi&#8208;step flow cascades. All four stereoisomers of the desired 1,3&#8208;diol product are accessible  via  a sequential flow approach with product formation&#8208;related conversions of up to 76% over two steps, isolated yields of up to 64% and enantiomeric excess of &gt;99% in all cases. In addition, a tandem&#8208;type flow process, performing both reaction steps simultaneously, was established leading to 51% conversion with &gt;99%  ee  and 8:1 d.r. and representing a combination of the fields of asymmetric chemocatalysis, biocatalysis and flow chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;phase synthesis of macrocyclic peptides via side&#8208;chain anchoring of the ornithine &#948;&#8208;amine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic peptides represent a popular class of macrocyclic drug candidates and therefore their solid phase synthesis has attracted much attention. In this contribution we present an efficient method of side&#8208;chain anchoring for ornithine and lysine residues to be used in the standard Fmoc&#8208;based synthesis of cyclic peptides via on&#8208;resin cyclization. We demonstrate that the side chain of ornithine and lysine protected with  N  &#8208;Boc&#8208;group can efficiently be converted to the isocyanate which is then immobilized on Wang&#8208;type resin in almost quantitative yield. We further show the synthesis of four biologically active cyclic peptides employing the side chain ornithine anchoring. Our method is at least on a par with the previously reported methodologies in terms of yield and the purity of the final products and is arguably operationally more straightforward.</dc:description>

         <title>2&#8208; and 6&#8208;Purinylmagnesium Halides in Dichloromethane: Scope and New Insights into the Solvent Influence on the C&#8722;Mg Bond</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly functionalized purine systems were obtained using aldehydes and, for the first time, ketones through a recently developed iodo&#8208;Mg exchange methodology that works in DCM. DFT calculations suggested that the observed major stability of the C&#8722;Mg bond generated in DCM at higher temperature compared to the one in THF might be derived from a less polar character of the C&#8722;Mg bond in such non&#8208;coordinating solvent.







Abstract
The generation of positionally stable purin&#8208;2&#8208; and 6&#8208;yl magnesium halides is complicated by the often very rapid isomerization to give the 8&#8208;yl Grignards. By conducting the reaction in dichloromethane (DCM), we demonstrated that the anion isomerization can be stopped and these stable purin&#8208;2&#8208; and 6&#8208;yl Grignards react directly with a broad scope of aldehydes in good yields. Furthermore, purine functionalization with ketones has been achieved for the first time in the presence of LaCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2LiCl. Density functional theory calculations offer a possible explanation of the special role played by solvent in this chemistry and show that in DCM the C&#8722;Mg bond has a less polar character, whereas in THF it is predominantly ionic and much more basic in nature.

         <title>Synthesis and Studies of Potential Inhibitors of CD73 Based on a Triazole Scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several series of substituted 1,4,5&#8208;triazole derivatives bearing various aryls, alkyls and indoles groups were synthetized, as inhibitors of 5&#8242;&#8208;ectonucleotidase CD73, and evaluated for their potential inhibitory effect on purified recombinant hCD73 enzyme and in cell&#8208;based assays. Among them, some compounds were found to be potent enzymatic inhibitors at 10&#8197;&#956;M.







Abstract
The ecto&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;nucleotidase CD73 is involved in the production of immunosuppressive adenosine in the tumoral microenvironment and recently became a validated target in immuno&#8208;oncology. To avoid formation of CD73&#8208;produced adenosine, several series of potential inhibitors of the target enzyme based on a triazole scaffold were synthetized and evaluated on recombinant purified hCD73 and in cell&#8208;based assays.

         <title>A Hexagonal Shape&#8208;Persistent Nanobelt of Elongated Rhombic Symmetry with Orthogonal &#960;&#8208;Planes by a One&#8208;Pot Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triptycenes with their predefined D 3h &#8208;symmetry are excellent molecular building blocks to construct shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles having &#960;&#8208;orbitals orthogonal to the ring plane. However, up to now, there are only a very few examples of fused and rigid iptycene macrocycles synthesized in several consecutive steps in overall yields below 1%. Here we present the simple one&#8208;step one&#8208;pot approach to an iptycene nanobelt, which forms in &gt;2% and can readily isolated from the polymeric by&#8208;product by gel&#8208;permeation chromatography.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Proving Syntheses of the Polyenoyltetramic Acids Pyranonigrin J and I</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The polyenoyltetramic acids pyranonigrin J (3) and py&#173;ranonigrin I (4) had been isolated from Aspergillus niger. Their or&#173;igins from and roles in biosynthesis as well as the S&#8208;con&#173;figura&#173;tions of their stereocenter had been deduced from expres&#173;sion ex&#173;periments with modifications of the corresponding gene cluster. We corroborated this stereochemical assignment after ex&#173;ecuting the first total syntheses of both compounds because they had es&#173;sentially the same specific rotations as their natural coun&#173;ter&#173;parts. Our syntheses used the &#946;&#8208;ketothioester 18 as a con&#173;junctive re&#173;a&#173;gent. It was combined with the l&#8208;serine derivatives (S)&#8208;19 or (S)&#8208;21 (&#8220;Western building blocks&#8221;), respectively, through aminolyses.

         <dc:description>A Wittig reaction of 3&#8208;hydroxyphtalide (11) gave ortho&#8208;sty&#173;rene&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid (12).

This led to aryl &#8220;methyl&#8221; ketones whose sp3&#8208;carbon was substituted by Cl + OMe (in 14a), 2 &#180; Cl (in 14b), OtBu (in 17a), SPh (in 17b) or SO2Ph (in 17c). The enolates of these ketones were C&#8208;allylated. This furnished the benzene&#8208;fused octa&#8208;1,8&#8208;dienones 7a&#8208;b and 9a&#8208;c, respectively.

Their ke&#173;tone moieties were a,a&#8208;disubstituted (in 8a&#8208;b) or a&#8208;monosub&#173;stituted (in 10a&#8208;c). Each substitution pattern allowed to generate the hydroxy&#173;enone&#160; motif of the corresponding benzocyclo&#173;heptatrienone &#8208; or 6,7&#8208;benzotropolone &#8208; 6a: The MeO&#8208; and PhS&#8208;con&#173;tain&#173;ing benzo&#173;cy&#173;clohep&#173;tadienone 8a gave 6,7&#8208;benztropo&#173;lone methyl ether (15) by sulf&#173;oxide formation and pyrolysis; 15 was demethyl&#173;ated with BCl3.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient palladium/CuTC cocatalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction procedure for the synthesis of C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;acyl nucleosides from the corresponding nucleoside 5&#8242;&#8208;carbothioates and boronic acids is described.

The chemical functionalization at C&#8208;5&#8217; position of nucleosides has been significantly less studied compared to the C&#8208;1&#8217;, C&#8208;2&#8217; and C&#8208;3&#8217; sugar positions in spite of its potential important role for biological activity. We describe here the synthesis of new carbothioate nucleosides which were then engaged in a Liebeskind&#8208;Srogl reaction with various boronic acids for the preparation of diversely modified C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;acyl nucleosides. Applied to pyrimidine nucleosides in the DNA and RNA series, the reaction showed a broad substrate scope and more than 25 examples were synthesized in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent isolated yields. This general and efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed and Cu(I)&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;coupling represents a convenient method to prepare a diverse set of 5&#8217;&#8208;modified nucleosides and paves the way for further transformation into a variety of potentially bioactive compounds via the possible conversion of the C&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;ketone.

&lt;p&gt;An efficient palladium/CuTC cocatalyzed cross-coupling reaction procedure for the synthesis of C-5&#8217;-acyl nucleosides from the corresponding nucleoside 5&#8242;-carbothioates and boronic acids is described. The procedure is fast, efficient, and it tolerates a wide variety of functionalities, thus expanding the so far limited chemical methods for C-5&#8217; diversification of deoxy- and ribonucleosides.

         <dc:description>The first continuous flow syntheses of sulfur&#8208; and selenium&#8208;NHC (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) adducts in unprecedented short reaction times and high yields are reported.

         <title>Discrepancy Regarding the Dethreading of a Dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 Macrocycle through a Perfluorobutyl End in [2]Pseudorotaxanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and dethreading study of DB24C8&#8208;based pseudorotaxanes are reported. The pseudorotaxane axles contain ammonium and carbamate stations as well as a repulsive nonafluorobutyl group as one of the two extremities. This extremity prevents any threading of the DB24C8. However, dethreading of pseudorotaxanes is possible and the kinetic rate depends on the presence and localization in the encircled axle of secondary sites of interactions (carbamates).







Abstract
Here are reported the synthesis and characterization of four new dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8)&#8208;based ammonium&#8208;containing pseudorotaxanes, for which one of the two encircled axle's extremities consists of a perfluorobutyl moiety. The subsequent dethreading of the DB24C8 over the perfluorobutyl extremity was studied. Although the perfluorobutyl extremity of an ammonium&#8208;containing axle did not allow threading of DB24C8, dethreading of a perfluorobutyl extremity&#8208;containing pseudorotaxane was possible and its rate depended on both the strength of the template&#8208;to&#8208;DB24C8 complex and the nature of the axle. In particular, dethreading process may be assisted by the presence, in the threaded axle, of a poor secondary site of interaction for the DB24C8 and this assistance proved to be higher when this site is close to the DB24C8.

         <title>Construction of benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles by epoxide &#8211; heteronucleophile cyclization: applications in the synthesis of natural products and designed molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Construction of benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles, specifically which have one or more sp  3  stereogenic carbon atoms on the heterocyclic ring, by intramolecular ring&#8208;opening cyclization of epoxides with  O  &#8208; and  N  &#8208;nucleophiles is a powerful synthetic tool in organic synthesis. In this review, we analyze the efficiency of such a heterocyclization approach in natural product synthesis and synthetic methodologies published since the year 2000. In addition to briefly discussing the synthetic methods of accessing the requisite epoxide substrates, important aspects of the subsequent cyclization reaction, such as reaction conditions,  endo  &#8208; versus  exo  &#8208;regioselectivity, protecting or functional group compatibility, and enantio&#8208; and distereoselectivity are analysed. Noteworthy is that although the literature of organic chemistry in the last four decades has witnessed a large number of reviews/book chapters on epoxide ring&#8208;opening chemistry, this is the first time that the current topic is systematized as a dedicated review.</dc:description>

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Synthesis of a Hexapeptide by Fragment Coupling in a Ball Mill</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using solvent&#8208;less techniques such as ball milling, a hexapeptide was synthesized in gram scale without using any toxic solvents. To date, this hexapeptide is the largest precisely controlled amino acid sequence ever synthesized in a ball mill. This study paves the way to future developments for the synthesis of longer peptides (and proteins) by using ball milling.







Abstract
Synthesis of long peptides is generally considered as a challenge to peptide chemists, in addition to producing significant amounts of toxic waste, such as DMF. Here we show that using solvent&#8208;less methods, such as ball milling, enabled the production of the hexapeptide Boc&#8208;(Ala&#8208;Phe&#8208;Gly)2&#8208;OBn at the gram scale with high overall yield (77&#8201;%, 5 linear steps). This is the longest peptide chain synthesized in a ball mill to date, in which the amino acid sequence is precisely controlled. This study complements the current fundamental knowledge required to synthesize longer and more difficult peptide chains (or small proteins) by using peptide fragment couplings in a ball mill.

         <title>A 2000 to 2020 Practitioner&#8217;s Guide to Chiral Amine Based Enantioselective Aldol Reactions:Common Ketone Substrates,Best Methods,in Water Reaction Environments,and Defining Nuances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We begin with an extensive introduction for the non&#8208;expert regarding enantioselective, amine catalyzed, aldol reactions (Sections 1&#8208;3). There, a broad prospective is provided regarding: methodology limitations, mechanism, in water versus on water definitions and their theoretical basis, small&#8208; and large&#8208;scale physical&#8208;mechanical aspects, solid versus liquid starting material considerations, reproducibility, ball milling, diketone substrates, etc. The thematic emphasis then turns to practical outcomes for the reaction of nineteen aliphatic, cyclic, and aromatic ketones with 4&#8208;nitrobenzaldehyde and benzaldehyde prior to 2021. The ketone substrates are listed in Section 4 of the TOC and their structures are shown in Figure 1. Each ketone is linked to a summary defined by a: (i) schematic, (ii) text summary, (iii) catalyst Figures, and (iv) tabular reaction/product data. Individual ketone summaries, at times, represent the distillation of over six hundred research articles, and the data refinement and its tabular reconstitution is not reproducible using a chemical database search with filters. In the review&#8217;s broadest use, the Figure 1 ketone structures serve as templates to extrapolate to a hypothetical substrate holding more functionality, but of related steric and electronic similarity. This pseudo matching permits a rapid answer to, &#8220;Does this methodology suit the ketone substrate at hand or not?&#8221; In a positive outcome, the best reaction conditions (stoichiometry, catalyst structure and loading, solvent, time, etc.) to affect aldol product formation (yield, dr, and ee) are delineated. A second envisioned use allows the directed construction of diketone substrates (after viewing the tabularized data of Section 4), which then undergo regioselective mono&#8208;aldol product formation. This tactic, reacting one carbonyl moiety while the other remains unreacted, avoids ketone protection&#8208;deprotection, and is shown for the advantageous synthesis of an Alzheimer drug candidate.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein&#8208;Polymer Bioconjugates Prepared by Post&#8208;Polymerization Modification of Alternating Copolymers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward strategy is proposed for the synthesis of protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugates using one of the oldest polymers, the poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride). Different poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) copolymers were successfully prepared by RAFT polymerization in dioxane using the 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;propyl dodecyl trithiocarbonate as chain transfer agent (CTA) and AIBN as initiator. Original biomacromolecules were successfully prepared by post&#8208;polymerization modification.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugates have shown great promise in biomedical and life science applications including drug delivery and diagnosis. The current bioconjugation strategies suffer from lack of efficiency and versatility. In this article, poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) copolymers were first prepared by RAFT polymerization and characterized by different analytical techniques. Then, the poly(styrene&#8208;alt&#8208;maleic anhydride) precursors were functionalized with primary amine such as azidopropylamine and amino poly(ethylene glycol). The reaction of amino compounds with maleic anhydride was found to be a highly efficient, a versatile, and a facile chemical ligation reaction for the synthesis of macromolecules with quantitative yield under mild conditions. The main benefit is the incorporation of a wide range of functionality by easily changing the primary amine compound. For the amphiphilic graft copolymers based on poly(ethylene glycol), aggregation behavior in water was investigated. In a second part, azido&#8208;functionalized polystyrene copolymers were used to prepare a new protein&#8208;polymer bioconjugate by copper&#8208;free click chemistry reaction.

         <title>Supported Synthesis of Adenosine Nucleotides and Derivatives on a Benzene&#8208;Centered Tripodal Soluble Support</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy based on anchoring C(6) azidopurine nucleoside derivative to a tripodal soluble support allows to access the corresponding adenosine nucleotides. We extended the scope of the method to methylene bisphosphonate analogues and N6&#8208;benzylamine derivative.







Abstract
The first soluble&#8208;phase synthesis of adenosine nucleotides including &#945;,&#946; and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;methylene bisphosphonate analogues on a multi&#8208;pod support is reported. Anchoring of a 2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;protected purine nucleoside to the tripodal support via the nucleobase was successfully achieved using a microwave assisted Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition. Then, phosphorylation was performed, followed by cleavage with aqueous ammonia to provide adenine derivatives, and finally deprotection. When using benzylamine instead of ammonia, a derivative with N6&#8208;benzylamine adenine as nucleobase was obtained. This methodology allows to access adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;mono, di and triphosphates, as well as various analogues of pharmacological interest in modest to good yields.
