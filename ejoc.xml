         <title>Redox&#8208;Convertible Groups to Expand the Substrate Scope for Pentafluorosulfanylation of Styrenes by Photocatalytic Activation of Sulfur Hexafluoride</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The redox properties of the substrates must fit to the photoredox cycle for the activation of SF6. Strong electron&#8208;donating groups turned &#945;&#8208;phenyl styrenes into a redox&#8208;inactive state. These substrates are converted into redox&#8208;active derivatives by reversible modifications of the critical substituents. This concept of redox&#8208;convertible substituents allows a significant expansion of the substrate scope.

The photocatalytic activation of sulfur hexafluoride, SF6, is an important synthetic method to access pentafluorosulfanylated organic compounds because of the nontoxic properties of this gas. However, the redox properties of the organic substrates must fit to the photoredox cycle for the activation of SF6. Strong electron&#8208;donating groups turned &#945;&#8208;phenyl styrenes into a redox&#8208;inactive state. These substrates has to be converted into redox&#8208;active derivatives by reversible modifications of the critical substituents. This concept of redox&#8208;convertible substituents has been successfully applied to expand the substrate scope for the pentafluorosulfanylation of &#945;&#8208;phenyl and &#945;&#8208;methyl styrenes by using SF6.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Asymmetric Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Dihydrobenzofurans by [4 + 1] Annulation with Substituted Salicyl N&#8208;Phosphonyl Imines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aggregation&#8208;induced asymmetric synthesis of trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran compounds was achieved via the reaction of salicyl N&#8208;phosphonyl imines with sulfur ylide. This transformation proceeds through a [4 + 1] annulation pathway, affording products in good to excellent yields with tunable diastereoselectivities. By employing various THF/EtOH cosolvent systems in conjunction with group&#8208;assisted purification (GAP) chemistry, the conventional aggregation cosolvent systems were shown to play a crucial role in enhancing diastereoselectivity and modulating aggregate formation. This was supported by studies involving aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), aggregation&#8208;induced polarization (AIP), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The developed protocol provides a practical and versatile synthetic approach to 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran scaffolds, highlighting the utility of aggregation&#8208;induced asymmetric synthesis (AIAS) as a powerful strategy for achieving stereocontrol.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical gem&#8208;Bisarylation of Hydrazone: Access to Bis(indolyl)methane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electrochemical organic method for the direct synthesis of bis(indolyl)methane derivatives is presented, with the reaction of hydrazones and indoles. This developed approach is effective for aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroaromatic aldehydes, which react with a range of electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor indoles to produce the desired BIMs in good to excellent yields. Additionally, potential antiobesity drug was also successfully synthesized with various indole derivatives under the influence of an electric current, and the transformation of BIMs demonstrated the application potential of this protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions in Aqueous Micellar Media</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thanks to their ability to efficiently and reliably construct carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds, cross&#8208;coupling reactions remain at the forefront of chemical research in both academic and industrial settings. However, the growing emphasis on sustainability has exposed the shortcomings of cross&#8208;coupling chemistry in several areas, including the preponderance towards toxic polar aprotic solvents, high loadings of precious metal catalysts, and production of large quantities of waste. In recent years, micellar reaction media, formed by dissolution of surfactant molecules in water, have emerged as a sustainable alternative to organic solvents, allowing for use of water as the bulk medium while circumventing the usual solubility issues associated with its use. This Review introduces the fundamentals of surfactants for synthesis and summarises recent advances in cross&#8208;coupling chemistry in micellar media, with a focus on improving both sustainability and reaction performance using micellar technologies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The photocatalytic decarboxylation of &#945;&#8208;amino acids is an effective route to &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals which is also amenable to the derivatization of peptides through selective C&#8211;C bond formation at the C&#8208;terminus. We report that, in the presence of an iridium photocatalyst, allylic difluorides are suitable radical traps to capture &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals produced from &#945;&#8208;amino acids, ultimately amounting to a defluorinative 3&#8208;fluoroallylation reaction. The catalytic system was applied to the derivatization of a wide breadth of N&#8208;protected amino acids and dipeptides in high yields, and the transformation displays great functional group tolerance. &#945;&#8208;Amino acids of all substitution levels at the &#945;&#8208;carbon led to the desired products in high yields.

         <title>Determination of the Transfer Rates of Porphyrins from Polysaccharide to Lipid Membranes in the Preparation of Lipid Membrane&#8208;Incorporating Porphyrins via the Host&#8208;Exchange Process</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substituents of porphyrins determine whether porphyrins will transfer from polysaccharides to liposomes by the host&#8208;exchange method. A method involving cyclodextrin&#8208;induced liposome destruction is developed for determining the transfer rates of porphyrins from polysaccharides to liposomes.

Developing straightforward and efficient methods for incorporating functional hydrophobic guest molecules into lipid membranes is essential for the application of liposomes as drug delivery systems. In a previous study, the preparation of lipid&#8208;membrane&#8208;incorporated C60, C60 derivatives, and C70 (LMICx) was reported through a host&#8208;exchange method, wherein these molecules were transferred from &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin to liposomes. Herein, a similar host&#8208;exchange approach is applied to prepare lipid&#8208;membrane&#8208;incorporated porphyrins (LMIPors), transferring porphyrins from polysaccharides to liposomes. However, until now, there has been no means to determine the transfer rates. To determine the transfer rates of porphyrins from polysaccharides to liposomes, a method involving the collapse of LMIPors via complex formation between lipids and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin is developed. It is believed that this method is general and can be deployed to liposomes incorporating various guest molecules prepared as drug delivery systems on the host&#8208;exchange process.

         <title>Photochemical Synthesis of 2,6&#8208;Linked Anthracene Oligomers without Introducing Extra Substituents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates a photochemical method to synthesize 2,6&#8208;linked anthracene oligomers, addressing solubility challenges and achieving efficient &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Using photochemical precursors, selective photoirradiation converts them into oligomers, highlighting the versatility of this method. This approach allows for the synthesis of thin films, offering new applications in organic electronics.

Photoconvertible precursors of 2,6&#8208;linked anthracene oligomers (trimer, tetramer, and pentamer) are synthesized through repeated Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Upon exposure of these precursors to light at 450&#8201;nm, which corresponds to the n&#8211;&#960;* transition of diketone moieties, yellow precipitates are formed, suggesting the conversion to the corresponding anthracene oligomers from the precursors. The disappearance of 1H nuclear magnetic resonance peaks after photoirradiation indicates the formation of anthracene oligomers with less solubility. High&#8208;resolution (HR) mass spectrometry evidently indicates the oligomer formations, and infrared (IR) spectral analysis for thin films show the disappearance of peaks originating from the carbonyl groups, also supporting the conversion. The absorption spectra after photoirradiation indicate a red shift in the absorption peaks accompanying oligomer formations, suggesting an extension of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. The low solubility of the resulting anthracene oligomers in organic solvents highlights the effectiveness of this synthetic strategy using the photoconvertible precursor. This study provides a practical method to synthesize acene oligomers without the introduction of extra substituents.

         <title>Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocyclic&#8208;Cyclobutane&#8208;Fused Bicyclic &#947;&#8208;Lactones from 2&#8208;Hydroxycyclobutanone and Carboxamide&#8208;Bearing Wittig Reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of 2&#8208;hydroxycyclobutanone with a Wittig reagent bearing a benzooxazolone moiety results in the formation of a cyclobutane&#8208;fused bicyclic &#947;&#8208;lactone with the heterocyclic unit located at the bridgehead position. The proposed mechanism involves the transfer of the acyl ylide fragment and an intramolecular Wittig reaction to provide an intermediate butanolide, followed by an aza&#8208;Michael addition with the free heterocyclic component.

A cascade reaction has been established that enables access to structurally diverse 2&#8208;oxabicyclo[3.2.0]heptan&#8208;3&#8208;ones bearing a benzo[d]oxazol&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;one moiety at the bridgehead quaternary center in moderate to good yields in a single operation. The reaction illustrates the potential of 2&#8208;hydroxycyclobutanone as a substrate for the rapid preparation of unusual and complex molecular frameworks.

         <title>Nitrile N&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Based Fluorescent Probe to Impart Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission to Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent probes have been used extensively in chemical biology. However, there are a few fluorescence probes that covalently bind to less polar compounds without a catalyst. Herein, the design, synthesis, and click reaction of pyrene&#8208;based nitrile N&#8208;oxide (Pyrene&#8208;NO) are reported. The optical properties of the adducts of Pyrene&#8208;NO indicate that Pyrene&#8208;NO imparts the aggregation&#8208;induced emission behaviors to alkene&#8208;containing compounds.

Fluorescent probes have been used extensively in chemical biology, allowing the visual observation of bioactive compounds. While many variations of fluorescent probes that react to polar functional groups have been developed, there are few fluorescent probes that directly modify less polar compounds. In this article, pyrene&#8208;containing nitrile N&#8208;oxide (Pyrene&#8208;NO) has been designed and synthesized as a fluorescent dye clickable to alkenes without a catalyst. Pyrene&#8208;NO shows good reactivity to a terminal alkene, a polymer methacrylate, and a natural unsaturated lipid with internal alkenes to give the corresponding cycloadducts with pyrene as the fluorescent dye. The cycloadducts show aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behaviors in a poor solvent. While the adducts to 1&#8208;hexene or polymer methacrylate show AIE in water, the adduct to castor oil, as a natural glycerolipid, shows AIE in MeOH. The AIE behaviors are evidenced by the dependence of fluorescence intensity on the concentration and the enhanced fluorescence at 77&#8201;K compared with that at room temperature. It is suggested that the aggregation of the cycloadduct in the poor solvent would kinetically suppress the nonradiative deactivation of the excited state of pyrene based on interactions with oxygen, leading to an increase in fluorescence intensity.

         <title>Green Approach for Copper&#8208;Free Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira Cross&#8208;Coupling using Saponin&#8208;Based Micellar Catalysis in Water at Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A micellar catalysis that is derived from commercially available saponin for copper&#8208;free, Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling under mild reaction conditions has been developed. Using this green and sustainable method, a broad range of aryl/heteroaryl and alkyl terminal alkynes were cross&#8208;coupled with aryl/heteroaryl halides at ambient temperature in an aqueous medium. The commercially available, inexpensive, and plant&#8208;based natural saponin served as a surfactant for a micellar system that effectively enabled C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp) cross&#8208;coupling with a wide range of substrates. The attractive features of this protocol are the use of water as a reaction medium, the in&#8208;situ generation of the micellar&#8208;catalysis system from biodegradable natural saponins, good functional group tolerance, scalability of the products, and notably the ability to retain the catalyst activity by recycling the aqueous reaction medium.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen peroxide &#8208; responsive aminoferrocene prodrugs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aminoferrocene (AF)&#8208;based prodrugs are activated in cancer cells through reactions with H&#8322;O&#8322; and other reactive oxygen species (ROS), generating electron&#8208;rich AF&#8217;s. These, in turn, induce the production of highly toxic O2&#183;&#8208; and HO&#183;, leading to cancer cell death. Effective activation of these prodrugs depends on their ability to target intracellular organelles rich in ROS, as non&#8208;targeted prodrugs are practically inactive. In this study, we replaced the boronic acid pinacol ester&#8212;previously used as a ROS&#8208;trigger&#8212;with an &#945;&#8208;ketoamide fragment, which is more selective and sensitive to H&#8322;O&#8322;. This modification enhanced the anticancer efficacy of untargeted AF prodrugs, reducing the IC&#8325;&#8320; from 23.9&#8211;35.5 &#956;M (previously reported prodrug 13b) to 5&#8211;6.4 &#956;M (new prodrug 2a) in human ovarian cancer A2780 and Burkitt&#8217;s lymphoma BL&#8208;2 cells. Further analysis confirmed that the anticancer effect of 2a is driven by its ability to markedly increase intracellular ROS levels in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Halogenation&#160;of Aromatic and Heteroaromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The halogenation of aromatic and heteroaromatic systems has attracted considerable attention in recent decades owing to the importance of haloaromatics in biologically relevant compounds and their role as essential building blocks for more complex systems. In recent years, various research groups have explored the challenge of developing new synthetic methodologies for electrophilic halogenation. Nevertheless, these methods continue to encounter several challenges, such as waste products from halogenating agents, toxic or contaminating reagents, and problems with low regioselectivity, with polyhalogenation&#8212;often the predominant side reaction&#8212;occurring in some cases. In this context, organocatalysis has emerged as a promising approach to address these limitations. This review highlights key organocatalytic strategies reported in the last 14 years and discusses experimental aspects, mechanisms, and selectivity issues in chlorination, bromination, fluorination, and iodination of aromatic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Point&#8208;to&#8208;axis optical activity induction in extended, sterically congested chromophoric systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The readily available, modular and electronic circular dichroism (ECD)&#8208;silent derivatives of terephthalaldehyde (the probes) have exhibited an induced optical activity upon condensation with chiral primary amines. The central unit of the probe serves as an amine binder by forming imine bonds and is flanked by two extended chromophoric units (&#8220;the wings&#8221;). Modification of the wings by diphenylamine or carbazole units affects the sterical and spectroscopic properties of the probes. An increase in sterical congestion within the probe core resulted in a change in the mechanism of optical activity induction. In the more congested systems, the point&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transmission from the chiral amine (the inducer) to the chromophoric system led to the adaptation of helical conformation by &#8220;the wings&#8221; and the appearance of non&#8208;zero Cotton effects (CEs) in the low&#8208;energy part of the ECD spectrum. However, the sterically congested probes were sensitive to the chirality of the inducers but relatively indifferent to the differences in their structure. Thus, the chirality of the inducers triggers conformational change towards the thermodynamically preferred conformational diastereoisomer due to the probe's &#8212;1 &#8208; +1 operation scheme.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A direct visible&#8208;light &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8211;H bond alkynylation of N&#8208;aryl pyrrolidine derivatives with 1&#8208;bromoalkynes has been developed, enabling the synthesis of propargylic amines. This transformation utilizes&#160;[Ru(bpy)3]Cl2&#183;6H2O&#160;as a photocatalyst, driven by blue LED (455 nm) irradiation. Detailed mechanistic studies and cyclic voltammetry support the proposed reaction pathway, where the C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp) bond formation occurs via the oxidation of &#945;&#8208;amino radicals, followed by a radical coupling with 1&#8208;bromoalkynes.

         <title>Kinetic Estimation of Ring Opening of Cyclopropylvinyl Radical Using Radical Substitution Reaction on at the Tin Atom</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present study investigated kinetic estimation of cyclopropylvinyl radical. Treatment of cyclopropane&#8208;substituted 1,6&#8208;enyne with Bu3SnH resulted in multi&#8208;component radical cascade reaction, which commenced with addition of Bu3Sn radical to unsaturated amide followed by 5&#8208;exo&#8208;radical cyclization, generating cyclopropylvinyl radical intermediate. The intermediate then underwent either the ring cleavage of the adjacent cyclopropane ring, yielding the allene product, or the formation of dihydrostannole which was formed through direct radical substitution on a tin atom. The reaction path depended on the concentration of Bu3SnH. We applied this cascade process for a mechanistic probe to explore the radical reaction, and estimated kinetic parameters of the ring cleavage of the cyclopropylvinyl radical, which has not been well investigated.</dc:description>

The intermediate then underwent either the ring cleavage of the adjacent cyclopropane ring, yielding the allene product, or the formation of dihydrostannole which was formed through direct radical substitution on a tin atom. The reaction path depended on the concentration of Bu3SnH. We applied this cascade process for a mechanistic probe to explore the radical reaction, and estimated kinetic parameters of the ring cleavage of the cyclopropylvinyl radical, which has not been well investigated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Blue&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Desulfurization of Thioamides under Hydrosilylation Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 22, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insert text for Table of Contents here. This contribution described the first general iron&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenative desulfurization of thioamides under hydrosilylation, the transformation being driven by blue light irradiation at ambient conditions. Well&#8208;defined Fe(IMes)(CO)4 catalyst was used in the presence of phenylsilane under ambient conditions to promote selectively the reduction of thioamides furnishing the corresponding amines via the sole cleavage of the C=S bond. (30 examples, 29&#8211;97&#8201;% yields)







Abstract
Up to now, there were only few reports on Earth&#8208;abundant transition metal catalyzed reductions of thioamides, one of the explanation of this scarcity being the possible metallic catalyst poisoning due to the adsorption of species containing sulfur. In this contribution, we report the first general iron&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenative desulfurization of tertiary thioamides under hydrosilylation conditions at ambient temperature, the reaction being driven by blue light irradiation. To perform selectively the reduction of thioamides leading to amines (30 examples, 29&#8211;97&#8201;% yields), highlighting the sole cleavage of the C=S bond, Fe(IMes)(CO)4 catalyst was used in the presence of phenylsilane under ambient conditions.

Silver&#8208;Mediated Cascade Synthesis of Open&#8208;Cage Fullerenes from C60 and Propargylic Carbonates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 22, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bisfulleroids featuring an eight&#8208;membered ring orifice are synthesized in a one&#8208;pot approach via a multistep reaction sequence involving heating a solution of fullerene C60 and propargylic carbonates in the presence of a silver catalyst. The implementation of this strategy for the introduction of various substituents is thoroughly investigated.

In recent years, open&#8208;cage fullerenes (i.e., fullerene derivatives featuring an orifice within their cage structure) have attracted significant attention across multiple research areas in materials, coordination, supramolecular, and biomolecular chemistry. However, the methodology available for the preparation of open&#8208;cage fullerenes remains limited. Herein, it is discovered that upon heating fullerene C60 with propargylic carbonates in the presence of silver trifluoroacetate, a cascade of reaction steps is initiated, resulting in the one&#8208;step synthesis of the corresponding open&#8208;cage bisfulleroids. Moreover, the feasibility of introducing various substituents via this methodology is confirmed. Notably, the proposed protocol facilitates the synthesis of bisfulleroid derivatives, wherein a hydrogen atom resides on one side of the bridgehead carbon at the orifice, while an aryl or alkyl substituent is strategically introduced on the opposite side. This approach provides structural diversity for the synthesis of open&#8208;cage fullerenes and is expected to promote the widespread application of open&#8208;cage fullerene derivatives.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;free Three&#8208;Component Halophosphorothiolation of Enamides/Enoates for Regioselective Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Halogenated Phosphorothioates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 22, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and practical strategy for catalyst&#8208;free, three&#8208;component regioselective phosphorothiolation&#8208;halogenation of enamides/enoates is reported, enabling the synthesis of diverse amide/ester&#8208; and halogen&#8208;containing phosphorothioates in high yields. In addition, chlorophosphorothiolated amides can further undergo intramolecular cyclization to access phosphorothioated lactams. All of the tested compounds demonstrate potent and selective inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase.

A three&#8208;component regioselective phosphorothiolation&#8208;halogenation of enamides/enoates with P(O)SH compounds and NXS (X&#8201;=&#8201;Cl, Br) under catalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free conditions has been demonstrated. This strategy readily affords an array of valuable amide/ester&#8208; and halogen&#8208;containing phosphorothioates in good to excellent yields, featuring simple operations, diverse functional group tolerance, and easy scale&#8208;up. Preliminary studies reveal that the electrophilic phosphoranesulfenyl chlorides/bromides generated in&#8201;situ may be a key intermediate. Furthermore, phosphorothioated lactams can be easily obtained through the intramolecular substitution reaction of chlorophosphorothiolated amides. Notably, all of the tested products displayed potent and selective inhibitory activity toward butyrylcholinesterase.

         <dc:description>
A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed fluoro/fluorosulfonamidation reaction of styrenes by using 1&#8208;fluorosulfamoyl&#8208;pyridinium salt as a bifunctional reagent is described, which allows for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;fluoro sulfamoyl fluorides under mild conditions.

In this study, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated two&#8208;component &#946;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;fluorosulfonamidation reaction of styrenes is demonstrated. The bench&#8208;stable reagent, N&#8208;fluorosulfamoyl&#8208;pyridinium tetrafluoroborate can be used as a photoredox&#8208;active nitrogen&#8208;centered radical precursor and also as the fluoride source. This transformation can convert a series of styrenes to functional group&#8208;enriched products, including substrates with electron&#8208;donating or withdrawing groups, as well as di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituents on the C&#63743;C double bond.

         <title>Nonenzymatic Carboxylate Phosphorylation in Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 22, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phosphorylation of carboxylic acids to acyl phosphates is a recurring reaction in the core of microbial metabolism, a set of processes thought to date back to the origins of life. This study shows that carboxylate phosphorylation occurs in water without enzymes or adenosine triphosphate (ATP), enabled by diamidophosphate and nitrite.

The core pathways of autotrophic microbial metabolism have been proposed to be fossils of self&#8208;organized prebiotic chemistry. In recent years, numerous reactions within these pathways have been shown to occur nonenzymatically, supporting this hypothesis. However, the phosphorylation of carboxylic acids to the corresponding acyl phosphates, a recurring metabolic reaction, has notably yet to be demonstrated without enzymes. Here, this study shows that carboxylate phosphorylation is promoted by diamidophosphate and sodium nitrite in the presence of water, driven by the release of dinitrogen. The reaction occurs in minutes at 0&#8211;50&#8201;&#176;C to convert carboxylic acids to acyl amidophosphate intermediates, which then undergo nitrite&#8208;promoted hydrolysis to give the corresponding acyl phosphates. The partial overlap in scope with important metabolic carboxylates and the concentrated acidic conditions likely limit its direct applicability in metabolic origins of life scenarios. Nonetheless, the work represents a step forward in understanding nonenzymatic carboxylate phosphorylation and helps clarify how the transformation might eventually be rendered compatible with a protometabolism.

         <title>Tagitinin C, a Sesquiterpene Lactone, and Derivatives as Proteasome Inhibitors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 22, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tagitinin C, a sesquiterpene lactone from Tithonia diversifolia, shows a good level of activity on the proteasome system. Although the molecule is sensitive to light, pH changes, and nucleophiles, a derivatization program is devised to build intellectual property and obtain more stable analogs.

Tagitinin C, a germacranolide isolated from Tithonia diversifolia, is shown to be an inhibitor of the proteasome pathway. It is, however, a particularly unstable molecule, sensitive to acids, bases, nucleophiles, and light. Herein, a series of modifications aimed at improving the chemical and biological properties of the molecule is described. This study particularly focuses on isobutyrate chain replacement with other esters or ethers. The key steps are the cross&#8208;conjugated dienone reactivity neutralization by reduction and methylene lactone protection with morpholine or imidazole. Selective saponification of the isobutyrate is also achieved with crude pig liver esterase, leading to tagitinol C in moderate yield. Heliangine from the Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus) and hydroxylated derivatives of tagitinin C from the common sunflower (Helianthus annuus), two abundant field crops, constitute alternative sources of germacranolide derivatives not accessible from tagitinin C. Some esters are more potent than the lead compound, whereas the di&#8208;ethers display higher activity levels, probably due to better in&#8201;vivo stability.

         <title>Oxidative Cyclization of 1,7&#8208;Dienes Induced by &#945;&#8208;Oxyalkyl/Acyl Radicals to Access Functionalized Benzo[b]azepin&#8208;2&#8208;Ones</title>

         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free oxidative cascade cyclization strategy is presented that enables the efficient transformation of 1,7&#8208;dienes with readily available radical precursors, including alcohols, ethers, and aryl aldehydes, into structurally diverse benzo[b]azepin&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives.

A metal&#8208;free cascade oxidative cyclization method has been developed for synthesizing functionalized benzo[b]azepin&#8208;2&#8208;ones from 1,7&#8208;dienes using alcohols, ethers, or aryl aldehydes. The reaction generates &#945;&#8208;oxyalkyl or acyl radicals by direct C(sp3)&#63743;H or C(sp2)&#63743;H cleavage, avoiding photocatalysts and transition metals. This approach offers a mild strategy for the synthesis of benzo[b]azepine derivatives with high atom economy and efficiency. Mechanistic studies, including radical trapping and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry analysis, confirm a radical&#8208;mediated pathway involving cyclization and single&#8208;electron transfer.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Isomerization of Oxabicyclic Alkenes to 1,2&#8208;Naphthalene Oxides: A Density Functional Theory Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 22, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed isomerisation of unsymmetrical C1 and aryl&#8208;substituted 7&#8208;oxabenzonorbornadienes is studied using density functional theory (DFT). Elucidating the three&#8208;step catalytic cycle: oxidative addition, &#951;1&#8208; to &#951;3&#8208;allyl isomerisation, and reductive elimination determined the rate&#8208;determining step to be the oxidative addition. DFT calculations provide mechanistic insights into the steric and electronic effects behind the formed regioisomers.

The mechanism and regioselectivity of ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed isomerization of C1&#8208;substituted, unsymmetrical oxabenzonorbornadienes (OBDs) are investigated using density functional theory (DFT). This study elucidates a three&#8208;step catalytic cycle: oxidative addition, &#951;1&#8208; to &#951;3&#8208;allyl isomerization, and reductive elimination. Analysis of the free energy profile identifies oxidative addition as the rate&#8208;determining step and as the primary contributor to regioselectivity. DFT calculations predict that electron&#8208;deficient OBDs preferentially yield 1,2&#8208;naphthalene oxide, while electron&#8208;rich OBDs favor the formation of 1&#8208;naphthol products, in agreement with experimental findings.

         <title>Nickel(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Homocoupling of Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 22, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic system for the homocoupling reactions of various terminal alkynes has been developed. This reaction is characterized by cheap and stable NiCl2 as catalyst, 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline as the ligand, air as the oxidant, mild reaction conditions, and excellent functional group compatibility, demonstrating great potential for practical applications in the construction of symmetric 1,3&#8208;diyne derivatives.

The homocoupling of terminal alkynes is a key approach for constructing 1,3&#8208;diynes, typically relying on copper&#8208;based bimetallic systems. Herein, a catalytic system is developed based on nickel chloride, using 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline as the ligand and air as the oxidant, which successfully enables the homocoupling reactions of various terminal alkynes. This reaction is characterized by cheap and stable NiCl2 as catalyst, mild reaction conditions, and excellent functional group compatibility, demonstrating great potential for practical applications.

         <title>Synthesis of N,N'&#8208;Bisindoles via Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Formal (4 + 1) Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 22, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for the efficient synthesis of N,N'&#8208;bisindoles has been established by gold&#8208;catalyzed formal (4&#8201;+&#8201;1) cycloaddition.This reaction occurred via a domino aza&#8211;Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement/aza&#8211;Michael addition sequence, which allows for the formation of two C&#63743;N bonds and the direct construction of an indole ring.

Indole&#8208;based heterocycles are commonly found in natural products and pharmaceuticals, so the synthesis of such heterocycles has become an important research area. In spite of the rapid development of this research area, the synthesis of N,N'&#8208;bisindoles remains challenging and is far less developed. Herein, we present the synthesis of N,N'&#8208;bisindoles via gold&#8208;catalyzed formal (4&#8201;+&#8201;1) cycloaddition of alkynylcyclohexadienones with N&#8208;aminoindoles, which involves a domino aza&#8211;Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement/aza&#8211;Michael addition sequence. This reaction allows for the formation of two C&#63743;N bonds and the direct construction of an indole ring, leading to the synthesis of a range of N,N'&#8208;bisindoles in moderate to high yields with broad functional group tolerance. This work not only provides a new and efficient strategy toward the synthesis of N,N'&#8208;bisindoles but also enriches the research contents of formal (4&#8201;+&#8201;1) cycloadditions and domino reactions.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Selenylation of 2&#8208;Alkenylanilines for the Synthesis of 3&#8208;Selanylindoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 22, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrosynthesis of valuable 3&#8208;selanylindoles by selenylation of 2&#8208;alkenylanilines under metal&#8208;free and chemical oxidant&#8208;free conditions is described. The reaction involves a radical pathway and features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and straightforward operation.

An electrocatalytic cascade selenylation/oxidation of 2&#8208;alkenylanilines enables the assembly of various 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;selanylindoles in one&#8208;pot under chemical oxidant&#8208;free and transition metal&#8208;free conditions is disclosed. A series of functional 3&#8208;selanylindoles are smoothly furnished in acceptable yields. This electrocatalytic strategy is flexibly suitable for diverse diaryl diselenides and 2&#8208;alkenylanilines. This method is highlighted by broad substrate scope, good functional group compatibility, mild conditions, and easy operation. The preliminarily mechanistic experiments suggest that a radical pathway is probably involved in this protocol.

         <title>Recent Advances in Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed/Mediated C&#63743;SCF3 Bond Formation Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 22, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review (2014&#8211;2024) explores transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed strategies for C&#63743;X trifluoromethylthiolation (SCF3), a pharmacologically critical group with unique electronic and lipophilic properties. Three approaches are systematically analyzed: directing group&#8208;enabled C&#63743;H activation, cross&#8208;coupling methodologies, and light&#8208;assisted transition metal catalysis. Mechanistic insights, substrate adaptability, and current limitations are critically evaluated, emphasizing advances in the field of constructing C&#8208;SCF3 bond.

The trifluoromethylthiolated group (SCF3) is characterized by its strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability, excellent lipophilicity, good stability, and bioavailability, making it highly relevant for applications in drug design and development. This review summarizes recent advances in C&#63743;X (H, Cl, OTf, B(OH)2) trifluoromethylthiolation reaction from 2014 to 2024. The discussion is organized into three major sections: 1) transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H trifluoromethylthiolation reactions facilitated by directing groups, 2) transition metal&#8208;catalyzed trifluoromethylthiolation via cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and 3) light&#8208;assisted transition metal&#8208;catalyzed trifluoromethylthiolation reactions. Additionally, this review examines the substrate scope, limitations, and partial mechanisms associated with these transformations.

         <title>C&#63743;H Functionalization and Cyclization Reactions Using Hypervalent Iodine Reagents: A Review on Synthetic Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 22, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hypervalent iodine reagents (HIRs) are organoiodine compounds with iodine in +3 or +5 oxidation states. They mimic transition metals in oxidative reactions but are greener, easier to handle, and highly selective. HIRs are versatile tools widely used in oxidation, functional group transfer, cyclisation, and bond formation, offering sustainable and efficient options in synthetic organic chemistry.

Using hypervalent iodine reagents as a mediator or catalyst in C&#63743;H functionalization and cyclization reactions has emerged as a powerful strategy in organic synthesis. This review exhaustively probes the recent advancements in this field, focusing on copious reactions enabled by hypervalent iodine (III/V) reagents. The versatility of iodine as a promoter in numerous transformations, including C&#63743;H activation, functionalization, and cyclization processes is highlighted. The general mechanistic pathway of iodine in mediating these transformations, along with the underlying principles governing the selectivity and reactivity of these transformation processes, is discussed. Furthermore, reactions leading to the synthetic utility and applicability of iodine&#8208;catalyzed/promoted C&#63743;H functionalization and cyclization reactions in synthesizing complex natural products and biologically active molecules are showcased. Overall, this review provides valuable insight for researchers and pharmacists interested in harnessing the potential of hypervalent iodine in developing sustainable and efficacious synthetic methodologies.

Furthermore, reactions leading to the synthetic utility and applicability of iodine-catalyzed/promoted C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H functionalization and cyclization reactions in synthesizing complex natural products and biologically active molecules are showcased. Overall, this review provides valuable insight for researchers and pharmacists interested in harnessing the potential of hypervalent iodine in developing sustainable and efficacious synthetic methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reaction of Nitrones with Phosphinylallenes: DFT Mechanistic Investigations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction between phosphinylallenes and nitrones efficiently leads to 4&#8208;phosphinylpyrrolidin&#8208;3&#8208;ones. The mechanism involved in this reaction was theoretically studied to understand the overall pathway and the stereochemical outcome of the transformation. The first step of the mechanism is a (3+2) cycloaddition between the nitrone and the allene delivering an isoxazolidine ylidene intermediate. This never isolated intermediate undergoes a spontaneous rearrangement to the final 4&#8208;phosphinylpyrrolidin&#8208;3&#8208;one through the homolytic N&#8211;O bond cleavage followed by rotation and C&#8211;N recombination of the biradical intermediate. The computational results obtained from this study are highly informative for potentially obtaining diastereoisomerically and enantiomerically pure 4&#8208;phosphinylpyrrolidin&#8208;3&#8208;ones by a judicious choice of substituents on nitrone and allene.</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying the True Catalyst: A Mn(II) Salt versus&#160;Mn(II) Complexes in Epoxidation with m&#8208;Chloroperbenzoic Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidant meta&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid (m&#8208;CPBA) is used widely for the epoxidation of alkenes, yet its efficiency is often limited under ambient conditions. In this study we investigate the catalytic activity of a Mn(II) salt and mononuclear Mn(II) complexes, two of which are reported here for the first time, in the epoxidation of alkenes with m&#8208;CPBA under ambient conditions. Time&#8208;resolved Raman spectroscopy was used to monitor substrate conversion, oxidant consumption, and product formation. The data reveal that simple Mn(II) salts exhibit significantly higher catalytic activity than Mn(II) complexes, indicating that ligand coordination inhibits the reactivity of the manganese centre. The catalytic efficiency of Mn(II) perchlorate was particularly notable, achieving near&#8208;complete oxidation of styrene within minutes under mild conditions. Furthermore, epoxidation of a range of alkenes demonstrated that Mn(II) salts provide broad substrate scope and high selectivity. These findings suggest that simple Mn(II) salts can serve as highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective catalysts in alkene epoxidations with m&#8208;CPBA.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free HFIP&#8208;Promoted Synthesis of Benzhydryl Derivatives from Stilbenes as Masked Electrophiles under Oxidative Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An umpolung strategy allowing the use of stilbenes as electrophiles in substitution reactions is developed that relies on a combination of m&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid and hexafluoroisopropanol. This new step&#8208;economic approach gives rise to benzhydryl derivatives by the use of different nitrogenated, oxygenated, and sulfur&#8208; and carbon&#8208;based nucleophiles.

Benzhydryl derivatives are synthesized by a new strategy involving the use of stilbenes as an electrophilic reaction partner through umpolung reactivity in a nucleophilic substitution reaction. The transformation, which requires oxidative treatment with meta&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid and the presence of 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) as an essential solvent and reaction promoter, occurs through multiple consecutive steps. Under these conditions, different benzhydryl derivatives are synthesized by coupling stilbenes with a variety of nitrogenated, oxygenated, and sulfur&#8208; and carbon&#8208;based nucleophiles.

         <title>Luminescent click&#8208;pyrenyl nucleosides as novel building blocks for nucleic acids: synthesis, photophysics, confocal microscopy studies and oligonucleotide conjugation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of dinucleoside analogues with a &#8220;pyrenyl&#8208;triazole&#8208;N&#8208;(triazole)2&#8221; linker substituting the natural phosphodiester linkage. The compounds were obtained stepwise with the copper&#8208;catalyzed Huisgen (3+2) azide alkyne cycloaddition reaction of azidopyrene&#160;&#160;tripropargylamine, and the respective nucleoside azide. Due to the presence of the pyrenyl entity, compounds show unimolecular (in diluted solutions) or excimer (at higher concentrations and in the solid state) emission. Luminescence allowed to track their spatial distribution inside living MCF&#8208;7 cells by using confocal microscopy. The compounds showed am affinity to lipid membranes and localize in a form of granules or larger aggregates in the area of the cytosol including, in particular, the perinuclear region. Representative nucleoside was appended to the 5&#8217;&#8208;terminus of the deoxyribonucleotide 5&#8217;&#8208;d(TTT CTT TCC CTC)&#8208;3&#8217;. The resulting conjugate forms stable B&#8208;type DNA duplex with complementary oligonucleotide.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Films: Preparation, Properties, and Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as a class of crystalline porous materials, have attracted substantial interest due to their tunable structures and diverse functionalities. This review examines recent advancements in the preparation of COF films, with a particular focus on the strategies employed to synthesize these materials while achieving high crystallinity and porosity. The challenges encountered during the synthesis and application of COF films are discussed, including the necessity for scalable production methods and the optimization of their properties for practical applications. Current research and innovation efforts in the field of COF films are poised to broaden their potential applications across various domains. Although the synthesis of large&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystal COF films presents significant challenges, the progress observed in this area offers promising avenues for unlocking the full potential of COF films in electronic and optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Upcycling Food Waste: Ursolic Acid as Sustainable Feedstock</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a sustainable strategy to access the ursane class of natural products. Our complexity&#8208;controlling synthesis (CCS) approach employs ursolic acid &#8211; readily obtained from apple pomace, a waste product of apple juice production &#8211; as sustainable feedstock to access 24 natural products of the ursane family in short synthetic sequences (1&#8211;12 steps) and good yields (up to 98%).</dc:description>

         <title>Gold&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of substituted 4&#8208;pentafluorosulfanyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first synthesis of pentafluorosulfanylated oxazoles through a gold(I) catalyzed cyclization of SF5&#8208;alkynes and nitriles. We describe 17 examples of 4&#8208;SF5&#8208;oxazoles with NMR yield ranging from 3% to 75%. While the isolation of the pure pentafluorosulfanylated oxazoles proved challenging, the fluorinated heterocycles could nonetheless be obtained in yields between 14 and 52%, opening the door for their use as a novel fluorine&#8208;containing scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Preparation of Nickel Porphyrins Bearing Two to Four Nitro Groups at &#946;&#8208;Positions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation, isolation, and identification of dinitro, trinitro, and tetranitro metalloporphyrins bearing nitro groups on pyrrole rings&#8212;desirable intermediates that enable fundamental changes in the chemico&#8208;physical properties of the porphyrin core&#8212;were studied. All six possible dinitro&#8208;Ni&#8208;TPP isomers were formed; three were isolated as pure substances using column chromatography, while the remaining three were inseparable. All possible trinitro&#8208;Ni&#8208;TPP isomers were prepared and isolated, except for the 2,7,13 isomer. Attempts to synthesize tetranitro&#8208;Ni&#8208;TPP either through direct nitration of metalloporphyrin or via direct condensation of the nitropyrrole building blocks were unsuccessful. The molecular structures were unambiguously identified using 2D NMR experiments. Some experimental observations, though not all, were consistent with quantum chemical calculations performed on the geometry, energy, Fukui indices, dipole moments of nitroporphyrins, and the energy of nitration intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>An Efficient Asymmetric Synthesis of Finerenone via Evans' Chiral Auxiliary</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article reports a new application of Evans' chiral auxiliary for an efficient asymmetric synthesis of finerenone. This new application successfully achieves the key step of stereoselective construction of the naphthyridine core of finerenone, with a high diastereomeric ratio (dr 86:14) and an 80% yield of the desired product via Evans&#8217; chiral (R)&#8208;4&#8208;benzyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazolidinone. The downstream transamidation of ethyl ester, with ammonia, leads to the formation of finerenone.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic chemistry continues to evolve by discovering and applying novel catalytic systems that enable efficient and selective transformations. Herein, we report on developing and utilizing a newly synthesized organophotocatalyst for C&#8208;H functionalization and isomerization reactions. A pyridazine derivative is successfully used here as a photocatalyst to synthesize 1,3&#8208;oxazines via C&#8208;H functionalizations of Betti bases (a&#8208;aminoalkyl naphthols) and for the E&#8208;Z isomerization of 2&#8208;(alkylthio)&#8208;substituted&#8208;1,4&#8208;enedione derivatives. A tentative mechanism is also proposed for the catalytic behavior of the novel photocatalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>The Novel Radical&#8208;Based Strategies for the Construction of &#945;&#8208;Allenols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Allenols have become common advanced synthons for the synthesis of various of structures and are a frequent motif in natural products and pharmaceuticals. The special reactivity could occur due to the synergistic effect of the allene and hydroxy functional groups. Thus, many remarkable and elegant protocols have been explored through ionic pathways for the construction of &#945;&#8208;allenols. Recently, the rapid growth of radical chemistry has provided an alternative strategy to obtain &#945;&#8208;allenols through single&#8208;electron transfer. As compared to the ionic pathway, the radical pathway has clear advantages, such as mild conditions, high efficiency, and excellent selectivity control. In this Review, we summarize the most important contributions for the construction of &#945;&#8208;allenols via radical intermediates by categorizing them into different types of substrates. Additionally, mechanistic studies and synthetic challenges are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Behavior of Cobalt Complexes Bearing Imine&#8208;Pyridine&#8208;Oxazoline Ligands in Isoprene Polymerization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of cobalt complexes bearing imine&#8208;pyridine&#8208;oxazoline ligands were successfully synthesized and characterized. Upon activation with diethylaluminum chloride (AlEt2Cl), these cobalt complexes exhibited high catalytic activity in isoprene polymerization and provided cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;co&#8208;3,4 polyisoprene (cis&#8208;1,4/3,4 &#8776; 2:1). Among them, a complex featuring a diphenylmethyl substituent, demonstrated the highest thermal stability, maintaining a catalytic activity of up to 1.06&#215;105 g&#183;mol&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 at 70 &#176;C. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis showed that this complex adopted a trigonal bipyramidal configuration via N,N,N&#8208;tridentate coordination to cobalt center. Both the ligand architecture and the polymerization temperature were found to play critical roles in determining the catalytic performance and the structural properties of the resulting polymers. Furthermore, the influence of various polymerization parameters on catalytic activity and selectivity was systematically investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Fluorination of Proline Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates gem&#8208;difluorination of challenging proline substrates using electrochemical methods, both in vessel and flow, and highlights the occurrence of characteristic by&#8208;products and a higher conversion using a flow approach. Different thiol precursors are tested to identify key molecular features required for this reaction to occur.

The introduction of a fluorine into aliphatic substituents of lead candidates can impart unique structural characteristics that allow fine tuning of drug interactions; therefore, mild, specific, or late&#8208;stage fluorination procedures are of growing interest in medicinal chemistry, with the potential to be applied in F&#8208;18 radiochemistry. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of &#8220;reagent&#8208;less&#8221; electrochemical fluorination leading to mono&#8208; and gem&#8208;difluorinated proline cores featured in important fibroblast&#8208;activating protein inhibitors. Our study highlights the importance of using the appropriate activator substituents for allowing the process, the impact of different reaction parameters, and characterizes the various byproducts that are generated in the reaction. We have tested the reaction using a commercially available batch system and flow apparatus, achieving maximum yields of &gt;90% (batch) for mono&#8208; and of 6% (batch) and 9% (flow) for the gem&#8208;difluorinated proline model. These proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept results indicate that the flow approach is more efficient, but that different activating substituents will be needed to achieve higher yields.

         <title>Synthesis of a Selena&#8208;Hybrid [5]Radialene Derivative and Exploration of Polycyclic Heteroterphenoquinones as Ambipolar Charge Carriers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polycyclic heteroterphenoquinone with an embedded selenophenoradialene moiety is synthesized and its properties studied, including hole and electron mobilities alongside those of its thia&#8208;counterpart.

para&#8208;Terphenoquinone (pTPQ) in which a benzenoid ring has been replaced with a heterocycle is known as heteroterphenoquinone (HTPQ). While (H)TPQs are typically non&#8208;emissive and potentially open&#8208;shell species, it is recently reported that fully fused polycyclic HTPQs (or PHTPQs) bearing a sulfur heteroatom can either exhibit fluorescence or antiaromaticity depending on the &#960;&#8208;conjugation arrangement in the core. Since the synthesis of PHTPQs is rare, until now limited to the reported compound containing a sulfur atom, a selenium&#8208;containing fluorescent PHTPQ is now synthesized while attempting the isolation of elusive dinaphtho&#8208;dicyclopenta[b,d]selenophene. The fluorescent PHTPQ is further dehydrogenated to synthesize the first PHTPQ with an embedded selenophenoradialene (selena&#8208;hybrid [5]radialene), which is found to exhibit antiaromatic properties. The narrow optical highest occupied molecular orbital&#8211;lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO&#8211;LUMO) gap, short intermolecular interactions in the solid state, and redox amphoterism prompt the investigation of its ambipolar charge transport properties alongside the thia&#8208;analogue. The electron mobilities for PHTPQs comprising selenaradialene (1.96&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;3&#8201;cm2&#8202;&#8201;&#8202;V&#8722;1&#8202;&#8201;&#8202;s&#8722;1) and thiaradialene (1.58&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;3&#8201;cm2&#8202;&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;&#8202;s&#8722;1) cores are found to be one order of magnitude higher than that of the holes due to low&#8208;lying LUMO energy levels.

The mechanism of the reaction was established through DFT calculation and by trapping of the oxygen radical intermediate A with BHT, which was confirmed through 1H, 13C NMR spectra and HRMS. This process forms the highly fused hexacyclic heteroaromatics without requiring any metal catalyst or dehydrogenating agent. This intramolecular photocyclization, through the triplet energy transfer (EnT) process, is a fascinating example of the oxidative coupling reaction via distal sp3&#8208;C&#8208;H.</dc:description>

This reaction was catalyzed by DABCO(TfOH)&#8322; a homogeneous catalyst with HFIP serving as solvent. The process, performed exclusively in DABCO(TfOH)&#8322;, demonstrated excellent catalytic activity, yielding high product amounts (84&#8208;98%) and showing broad functional group compatibility, which enabled the efficient synthesis of both natural alkaloids and BIM derivatives.

         <title>Assembly of 1,2,3&#8208;Triazole&#8208;Fused Polycyclic Compounds by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8211;H Bond Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A palladium&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;fused heterocycles, such as 1,4,5,6&#8208;tetrahydrobenzo[c][1,2,3]triazolo[4,5&#8208;e]azepines and 4,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[5,6]oxepino[3,4&#8208;d][1,2,3]triazoles, is reported. The method was found to be versatile, high&#8208;yielding, and even suitable for domino and one&#8208;pot sequential protocols combining the copper&#8208;catalyzed reaction of alkynes and organic azides (CuAAC) with palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H bond activation. A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Syntheses of the Linearly&#8208;Fused Prenylated Indole Alkaloids Asperversiamides H and M via Oxidative Rearrangement of the Putative Biosynthetic Precursor Dihydrocarneamide A</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthesis of the linearly&#8208;fused prenylated indole alkaloid dihydrocarneamide A is reported and on treatment of this with a peracid it undergoes oxidative fragmentation to give a previously unreported isomer of the natural product amoenamide A. In contrast, treatment of dihydrocarneamide A with an oxaziridine afforded a mixture of the oxindole&#8208;containing natural products asperversiamides H and M.

An improved synthesis of the alkaloid dihydrocarneamide A is reported and this has been subjected to a biomimetic&#8208;type oxidative rearrangement using an oxaziridine and so affording the oxidole&#8208;containing and prenylated indole alkaloids (PIAs) asperversiamides H and M. This work serves to confirm the structure assigned to the latter. Oxidation of dihydrocarneamide A using m&#8208;chloroperbenzoic (m&#8208;CPBA) affords an oxidative fragmentation product representing the linear isomer of the PIA amoenamide A and thus a potential &#8220;natural product in&#8208;waiting&#8221;. Furthermore, oxaziridine&#8208;mediated oxidation of the epimer of dihydrocarneamide A (and the enantiomer of the structure assigned to the natural product asperversiamide F) afforded a mixture of two hitherto unreported oxindoles. Given the manner in which these last two products have been formed it seems likely that these, too, are &#8220;natural products in&#8208;waiting&#8221;. Certain cytotoxic and antimicrobial properties of key compounds are reported.

         <title>Formation of Prenylated Pterocarpans from Synthetically Derived Demethylmedicarpin by Regioselective Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Hydroarylation and Related Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The readily prepared pterocapan (&#177;)&#8208;demethylmedicarpan has been converted, via two&#8208;fold etherification then either gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation (IMHA) or aromatic Claisen rearrangement reactions, into the illustrated natural products including (&#177;)&#8208;erybraedins A and B. The IMHA reactions proceed regioselectively and may be directed through coordination of the gold catalyst to the ring oxygens.

Three prenylated pterocarpans including erybraedin A and erybraedin C have been synthesized from (&#177;)&#8208;demethylmedicarpin, itself prepared in four simple steps starting from resorcinol and 2,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenylacetic acid. A gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed and two&#8208;fold intramolecular hydroarylation (IMHA) reaction of a readily derived bis&#8208;propargyl ether of (&#177;)&#8208;demethylmedicarpin proceeds with remarkable regioselectivity to afford the racemate of a recently reported but yet&#8208;to&#8208;be named bis&#8208;2H&#8208;chromene&#8208;annulated pterocarpan&#8208;containing natural product. A possible explanation for this potentially very useful selectivity is advanced. In a related reaction sequence, a readily derived bis&#8208;allyl ether of (&#177;)&#8208;demethylmedicarpin undergoes a thermally&#8208;induced and two&#8208;fold aromatic Claisen rearrangement to give a 1:5 mixture of the racemic modifications of the isomeric and cytotoxic natural products erybraedin A and erybraedin C.

         <title>Assembly of Molecular Complexity by Carbene Organocatalytic Multicomponent Reactions Involving &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Aldehydes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over the past decades, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis has emerged as a powerful tool for multicomponent reactions (MCRs), enabling precise control over selectivity, stereochemistry, and functional group compatibility. This review highlights recent advancements in NHC&#8208;catalyzed MCRs involving &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, exploring their mechanisms, scope, and limitations, with the aim for development of carbene organocatalytic MCRs for the efficient synthesis of value&#8208;added molecules.

The pursuit of molecular complexity is central to modern organic synthesis, as complex molecules are essential across various fields. The development of catalytic multicomponent transformation strategies provides an efficient approach for the rapid and selective construction of complex molecular frameworks. Over the past decades, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene organocatalysis has emerged as a powerful tool in multicomponent reactions (MCRs), enabling precise control over selectivity, stereochemistry, and functional group compatibility that significantly facilitate the assembly of complex molecular structures. This review provides an overview of recent advancements in carbene&#8208;catalyzed MCRs involving &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, with an emphasis on reactions incorporating three or more reactants. These transformations are categorized into electron&#8208;pairing and radical pathways, with a detailed discussion of their mechanisms, scope, and limitations. Ultimately, this review aims to advance the development of catalytic strategies that leverage carbene organocatalysis to enable the efficient synthesis of value&#8208;added molecules from simple precursors.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Catalytic Access to Indanes via Intermolecular Cyclization from Internal Olefins/Ethers and Mechanism Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A green and sustainable protocol has been developed for metal&#8208;free synthesis of substituted indanes through Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular cyclization. Employing the acidic ionic liquid [BsPy][OTf] as a catalyst, this methodology achieved good selectivities to synthesize substituted indanes through intermolecular cyclization of benzyl ethers and internal olefins while eliminating metallic reagents, halogens, and post&#8208;reaction neutralization steps. Moreover, the acidity of ionic liquids was one of the significant factors affecting the yield and the selectivity. [BsPy][OTf] exhibited good selectivity and activity, and also had excellent recyclability. Controlling experiments revealed a carbocation&#8208;mediated pathway. DFT calculation indicated that the selectivity of indane as cyclization product is supported by both thermodynamics and kinetics&#160; catalyzed by [BsPy][OTf], and the product is determined to be substituted olefin controlled by kinetics using [MeBs(dio)TMP][OTf] as the catalyst. Moreover, the distance of C1&#8943;C5 to construct the indane ring is shorter and more readily to occur via cyclization path in [BsPy][OTf]&#8208;catalyzed system compared with that of [MeBs(dio)TMP][OTf].</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The work describes the copper (I)&#8208;catalyzed convenient synthesis of 5,5&#8242;&#8208;bis&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles by reacting glycosyl azides with terminal alkynes in the presence of di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide (DTBP) as oxidant in refluxing toluene. The reaction proceeds through intramolecular &#8216;click&#8217; followed by Csp2&#8208; Csp2 bond formation in the successive steps under one&#8208;pot conditions. The devised protocol is further extended to access biocompatible tetrakis(1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl) sialoconjugates under a two&#8208;step pathway followed by Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction. The developed glycoconjugates has been characterized using extensive spectroscopic analysis, including NMR (1H &amp; 13C), IR, and HRMS datas and also single crystal X&#8208;ray of compound 5e. Notably, the reaction proceeds in a one&#8208;pot fashion with high atom economy, where wide substrate scope with diversity in products finally validates the importance of the devised protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Multideuteration of (Hetero)Arenes via Hydrogen Isotope Exchange</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following the recent approval of deuterated drug &#8220;deutetrabenazine&#8221; and the commercialization of deuterated emissive materials for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, multideuteration technology has advanced significantly. Various strategies have been developed, utilizing both rare and earth&#8208;abundant metals to achieve efficient multideuteration. This review explores recent advancements in metal&#8208;catalyzed multiple deuteration, discusses current challenges, and highlights future opportunities in this rapidly evolving field.

Deuteration has gained a prominent role as a powerful method for investigating kinetic isotope effects in chemical reactions. Recent studies show that deuteration can significantly alter the pharmacokinetic and toxicological profiles of drug molecules, thereby enhancing their therapeutic efficacy. As a result, deuteration is being increasingly integrated into pharmaceutical development. At the same time, introducing deuterium into organic electronic materials helps to reduce high&#8208;frequency molecular vibrations, thus broadening the range of applications of organic materials, traditionally dominated by inorganic components. Since the approval of the deuterated drug deutetrabenazine in 2017 and the commercialization of deuterated emissive materials for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, multideuteration technologies have advanced considerably. Various strategies utilizing both rare and earth&#8208;abundant metals to achieve efficient multideuteration have been reported. This review examines recently developed metal catalysts for multiple deuteration, discusses current challenges in deuteration methods, and explores future opportunities in this rapidly evolving field.

         <dc:description>Using (Z)&#8208;3&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;chloropropenals, we have developed an efficient route for the stereoselective synthesis of unsymmetrical 3,3&#8208;diarylpropenals in high yield with very good retention of stereochemistry. Consequently, we have found an efficient route for the stereoselective synthesis of 3,3&#8208;diarylpropenoic acids which are precursors to 4&#8208;arylcoumarins. The Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling of (Z)&#8208;3&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;chloropropenals with arylboronic acid derivatives yields unsymmetric 3,3&#8208;diarylpropenals in high yields with excellent retention of stereochemistry. These 3,3&#8208;diarylpropenals are then oxidized to the corresponding acrylic acids, and lactonized to form 4&#8208;arylcoumarins.&#160;&#160;The lactonization reaction consistently occurs with the aryl group that is cis to the acid group, i.e. with the aryl group that is introduced in the Suzuki coupling step. Thus, the stereochemical retention of the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling step results in the ability to make a diverse catalogue of 4&#8208;arylcoumarins with complete stereoselective control. A variety of 4&#8208;arylcoumarins were synthesized via this route with several different aryl substituents at both positions with good yields and excellent stereochemical purity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Biaryls via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction between Arene Carboxylic Acids and Aryl Thianthrenium Trifluoromethanesulfonates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel decarboxylative palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling between easily available arene carboxylic acids and (hetero)aryl sulfonium salts has been studied. It turns out that (hetero)arylthianthrenium trifluoromethanesulfonates are the most efficient coupling partners and afford the desired biaryls in moderate to excellent yields. At the end of the reaction, thianthrene can be easily recovered and reused for another cross&#8208;coupling.

A simple aryl&#8211;aryl bond&#8208;forming reaction via palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling between cheap and easily accessible arene carboxylic acids and aryl thianthrenium trifluoromethanesulfonates is described. It turns out that the use of PdCl2 in the presence of Ag2CO3 in DMSO at 120&#8201;&#176;C is the most efficient system for performing this reaction. Various biaryls, bearing electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, including sterically hindered biaryls are successfully obtained. The amount of waste generated during this cross&#8208;coupling is minimized since thianthrene obtained as a by&#8208;product can be easily recovered and reused after reaction.

         <dc:description>
An efficient method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;fluorobenzamides is established from 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazinone using tetrafluoroboric acid under thermal and photochemical conditions.

An efficient method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;fluorobenzamides is established from 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazinones using tetrafluoroboric acid. The reactions proceed under mild thermal conditions, providing a wide range of functionalized 2&#8208;fluorobenzamides in 65%&#8211;80% yields. On the other hand, the reaction proceeds with 58%&#8211;63% yields at room temperature under visible light using blue LED conditions. Simple operation, metal&#8208;free conditions, and broad substrate scope are the benefits of the developed methodology.

         <title>Amino&#8208;Acid&#8208;Encoded Enantioselective Photocatalysis in Self&#8208;Assembled Porphyrin&#8211;Amino Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the excellent photocatalytic ability of porphyrin and the chiral advantage of amino acids, porphyrin has been modified using amino acids. The porphyrin&#8211;amino acids can exhibit opposite trends in enantioselectivity in the photocatalytic oxidation of tyrosine reaction. Moreover, the porphyrin&#8211;phenylalanine derivatives with carboxyl&#8208;terminal groups catalyze 700.10% more dityrosine in d&#8208;type substrates than in l&#8208;type substrates.

Porphyrin&#8208;based nanomaterials have attracted much attention in photocatalysis due to their excellent photoelectrocatalytic ability and strong intermolecular interaction forces. Herein, a series of chiral assemblies of porphyrin&#8211;amino acid derivatives are prepared by linking different types of amino acids with terminal modifications to tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin via covalent bonding and their catalytic ability in enantioselective photocatalytic oxidation of tyrosine is investigated. The results show that the amino acid type and terminal groups significantly affect the macroscopic assembly morphology and microscopic chiral space of the porphyrin&#8211;amino acid derivatives, which is consistent with the results of molecular dynamics simulations and further impacts the rate and enantioselectivity of tyrosine chiral photocatalytic oxidation. These results provide new avenues for applying porphyrin derivatives in chiral photocatalysis.

A facile amination reaction has been developed of unprotected 6&#8208;Cl purine and various bioactive amine derivatives under catalyst&#8208;free, solvent&#8208;free condition. Further, one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole attached unprotected hybrid nucleosides is shown.

An efficient catalyst&#8208;free, solvent&#8208;free amination reaction has been developed for the synthesis of various bioinspired 6&#8208;substituted aminopurine nucleoside analogs in good yields. In this sustainable approach, unprotected 6&#8208;substituted aminopurine nucleoside analogs are synthesized via amination reactions of unprotected 6&#8208;Cl purine nucleosides with various amine derivatives. Notably, the method offers a simple, eco&#8208;friendly, unifying protocol for the synthesis of various bioinspired molecules with highly functional group tolerance. Additionally, to demonstrate its synthetic applicability, a one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component reaction protocol &#160;has been shown for the synthesis of novel 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;attached hybrid nucleosides containing various drug core moieties via click chemistry.

         <title>Organic photocatalyst Eosin Y catalyzes the formation of C&#8208;S bonds under visible light</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of green and efficient C&#8208;S bond formation methods has received significant attention from synthetic chemists because the C&#8208;S bonds widely occurs in many important drugs and natural biological compounds. In recent years, photochemical organic conversion promoted by visible light has attracted the interest of many organic chemists. Compared with the traditional methods, visible light as the photoredox catalysis of renewable energy has been proved to be a mild and powerful tool that can promote the activation of organic molecules through the single electron transfer (SET) process. Therefore, this strategy has been widely applied in the formation of C&#8208;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. This article reviews the research results on the formation of carbon sulfur bond promoted by organic photocatalyst Eosin Y under visible light in recent years, and discusses representative examples and reaction mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective C&#8208;H Amination of Lupane&#8208;Type Triterpenoids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A synthetic protocol for rhodium&#8208;catalyzed, site selective C&#8208;H amination of the betulin scaffold has been developed. Under catalytic conditions, betulin&#8208;derived 28&#8208;O&#8208;sulfamate ester undergoes intramolecular C&#8208;H amination to afford 1,2,3&#8208;oxathiazinane&#8208;2,2&#8208;dione&#8208;fused lupane triterpenoids with a C16/C22 selectivity ratio 9:1. Introduction of a C16&#8208;substituent enables a second sequential C&#8208;H amination, which occurs with C22 selectivity. Betulin&#8208;derived oxathiazinanes can be cleaved and the ring&#8208;opened products provide straightforward access to 16&#8208;amino&#8208; and 16&#8208;azido&#8208;betulin, 16&#8208;amino&#8208;betulinic and 16&#8208;amino&#8208;betulonic acids. Betulin analogs with selectively introduced amine and azide functionalities are versatile building blocks for further medicinal chemistry applications in semi&#8208;synthetic triterpenoid series.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Atropisomeric Diarylamines Enabled by Bromine&#8208;Masked Indolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the use of a bromine atom as a masking group for the synthesis atropisomeric diarylamines via N&#8208;arylation of 7&#8208;bromoindolines. The bromine atom acts as a bulky group to temporarily stabilize the configuration by steric hindrance. Upon unmasking, less sterically hindered diarylamines are obtained, with configurational stability potentially maintained through intramolecular hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
Herein, we report the use of a bromine atom as a masking group for the synthesis atropisomeric diarylamines via organocatalytic N&#8208;arylation of 7&#8208;bromoindolines. The bromine atom acts as a bulky group to temporarily stabilize the configuration by steric hindrance. Upon unmasking, less sterically hindered diarylamines are obtained, with configurational stability potentially maintained through intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Moreover, the gram&#8208;scale reaction and post&#8208;modifications of the axially chiral diarylamines demonstrated the utility of this protocol. Thermal racemization experiments combined with X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed the respective contributions of steric repulsion and intramolecular hydrogen bonding in stabilizing the configurations. This approach not only provides a useful method for the atroposelective construction of conical diarylamines, but also paves the way for a better understanding of stable axial chirality and its role in shaping chemical reactivity and biological activity.

         <title>Sunlight&#8208;Driven, Catalyst&#8208;Free Synthesis of Cyclobutanes by [2+2] Cycloaddition of Fluorinated Heterochalconoids in Solution</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cyclobutane ring constitutes an interesting scaffold for the development of new materials and drugs. In this work we describe the [2+2] cycloaddition of chalconoid precursors bearing fluorinated and heterocyclic moieties to produce cyclobutane derivatives in solution. The reaction is promoted by sunlight and does not require any added photocatalyst. The regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity output depends on the heteroaromatic system and the number of fluorine atoms. Experimental results and DFT calculations support a mechanism through the formation of an EDA complex between two molecules of the chalconoid.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure of Geminal Diol&#8211;Type Intermediates and Their Reactivity in Modern Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gem&#8208;diols, as crucial intermediates in organic reactions, have been characterized using advanced analytical methodologies. This concept systematically examines the thermodynamic stability and synthetic accessibility of gem&#8208;diol&#8208;type structures, focusing on their reactivity in organic synthesis and their utility in mechanistic studies.

Geminal diol (gem&#8208;diol) moieties commonly exist in equilibrium with ketones or aldehydes when water is present in the system. While significant progress has been made in their structural characterization, recent studies have increasingly focused on the reactivity of gem&#8208;diol intermediates. In parallel, gem&#8208;diol&#8208;type hydroxyl&#8208;oxoammonium species have been reported as key intermediates in various reactions. Accordingly, this concept highlights recent advances in the structural elucidation of gem&#8208;diol&#8208;type intermediates and, more importantly, discusses their reactivity and potential application in organic reactions. In addition to typical gem&#8208;diol species, the discussion also encompasses other gem&#8208;diol&#8208;type species with O&#63743;C(sp3)&#63743;O or O&#63743;N(sp3)&#63743;O centers derived from C(sp2)&#63742;O or N(sp2)&#63742;O centers, respectively. The ultimate aim is to inspire the development of more efficient strategies for employing such gem&#8208;diol&#8208;type intermediates in organic synthesis.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method has been developed for Michael/electrophilic substitution cascade reaction via bifunctional organocatalysis to synthesize a diverse array of spiro&#8208;oxindole derivatives bearing bis&#8208;tetrasubstituted carbon centers, achieving high yields and exceptional diastereoselectivities. This strategy, in conjunction with traditional metal catalysis, facilitates the switchable, chemodivergent synthesis of spiro&#8208;oxindoles.

An efficient method has been developed for Michael/electrophilic substitution cascade reaction between 3&#8208;pyrrolyl&#8208;oxindoles and unsaturated ketoesters, utilizing bifunctional organocatalysis. This approach enables the synthesis of a diverse array of spiro&#8208;oxindole derivatives bearing three stereogenic centers, two of them quaternary, achieving high yields and exceptional diastereoselectivities. Furthermore, the resulting products can be readily converted into tetrahydropyridine skeletons through an elimination process in one pot. This strategy, in conjunction with traditional metal catalysis, facilitates the switchable, chemodivergent synthesis of spiro&#8208;oxindoles, offering significant synthetic flexibility and potential for broader applications.

This strategy, in conjunction with traditional metal catalysis, facilitates the switchable, chemodivergent synthesis of spiro-oxindoles, offering significant synthetic flexibility and potential for broader applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insight on p&#8208;Acetoxybenzyl Carbonate as an Orthogonal Hydroxyl Protecting Group in Oligosaccharide Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new protecting group can be easily installed in one synthetic step and selectively removed by using catalytic amounts of ytterbium(III) triflate at room temperature. Moreover, this new protecting group is orthogonal with tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS), p&#8208;methoxybenzyl (PMB), acetonides, and benzylidenes groups. Finally, the new protecting group is applied to oligosaccharide synthesis to prove their stability under glycosylation conditions.

This study describes the utility of p&#8208;acetoxybenzyl carbonate (ABC) group for the protection of hydroxyl functions. This hydroxyl protecting group can be easily prepared using inexpensive commercially available 4&#8208;hydroxybenzyl alcohol as the starting material. The ABC group can be selectively removed through ytterbium(III) triflate&#8208;catalyzed transesterification at room temperature without affecting commonly used acid&#8208;cleavable protecting groups, such as tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS), p&#8208;methoxybenzyl (PMB), acetonide, and benzylidenes. Notably, the ABC protecting group is stable under glycosylation conditions in oligosaccharide synthesis.

Bicyclo[1.1.0]butane derivatives are a class of strained electrophiles. A variety of carboxamide derivatives of these electrophiles are converted under palladium catalysis into a series of 3&#8208;allylindolin&#8208;2&#8208;one products. The moderate&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields and the broad substrate scope indicate that this reaction is a highly appealing strategy

As a novel class of reactive electrophiles, bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCB) remain relatively underexplored. Herein, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes is disclosed that provides a variety of 3&#8208;allylindolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields with very good functional group tolerance. This protocol features mild reaction conditions and broad substrate scope.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of efficient ambipolar charge&#8208;carrier transporting deep&#8208;red to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores, namely MNTFT, PNTFT, and BMNTFT, based on an asymmetric donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor' (D&#8208;A&#8208;D') structure, as well as their application as non&#8208;doped emitters in NIR organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The molecules comprise naphtho[2,3&#8208;c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (Nz) as a strong A, bis(4&#8208;diphenylaminophenyl)fluorene as D, and either diphenylamine or dimethylaminophenyl as D'. Both experimental and theoretical investigations confirm that they exhibit hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) excited states, which enable the pathways for harvesting triplet hot exciton via high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing (hRISC) with intense NIR emissions (&#8764;708 nm). Their asymmetrical D&#8208;A&#8208;D' features benefit well&#8208;balanced hole and electron mobilities, resulting in a successful application as a non&#8208;doped emissive layer in the OLEDs with decent performance. Particularly, the MNTFT&#8208;based non&#8208;doped device shows an NIR emission with a peak at 710 nm, a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 2.51%, and a low turn&#8208;on voltage of 3.2 V. These results represent a significant advancement in the development of NIR fluorescent materials and OLED devices, meeting key requirements for various applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the [3+2] Cycloaddition Reaction of Azomethine Ylides with Methyl Vinyl Ketone in the Triplet Excited State: A Molecular Electron Density Theory Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photochemically induced [3+2] cycloaddition of azomethine ylide with methyl vinyl ketone begins with the formation of a triplet biradical intermediate INT1 via the transition state structure TST1. The formation of the final spirooxindole SOIS0 requires intersystem crossing at INT1. The reaction in the triplet state is only 589 times faster than in the ground state.

The [3+2] cycloaddition (32CA) reaction of an azomethine ylide with methyl vinyl ketone in the ground and first triplet excited states has been studied within the framework of molecular electron density theory. A density functional theory&#8208;based reactivity analysis indicates that, while azomethine ylide behaves as a supernucleophile in both states, vinyl ketone acts as a strong electrophile. This 32CA reaction presents a very low activation energy both in the ground state, 3.40&#8201;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, and in the triplet state, 1.47&#8201;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, in the gas phase. While in the ground state, the 32CA reaction is entirely ortho regio and fully endo stereoselective, in the triplet state it is entirely ortho regioselective but only partially endo stereoselective. In the ground state, the reaction proceeds to form the spirooxindole after passing through the transition state structure, whereas in the triplet state, the reaction stops at a biradical intermediate, which requires an intersystem crossing to yield the final spirooxindole. Analysis of the kinetic parameters of the 32CA reaction in the two states in methanol indicates that in the triplet state, the reaction is only 589 times faster than in the ground state.

Enantioselective Desymmetrization of Bisphenol Derivatives by Organocatalytic Sulfonylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient organocatalytic strategy involving the desymmetrization&#8211;sulfonylation of bisphenols is introduced for the synthesis of chiral 1,1&#8208;diarylalkanes. A chiral thiourea catalyst enables the selective sulfonylation of one hydroxyl group with a sulfonyl chloride in a CHCl3/H2O system under basic conditions, affording the reaction products with high yields and enantioselectivities.

Chiral 1,1&#8208;diarylalkanes are synthesized by enantioselective desymmetrization of bisphenol derivatives through an organocatalytic sulfonylation reaction. The methodology involves the selective sulfonylation of one enantiotopic hydroxyl group of a bisphenol using a sulfonyl chloride with a chiral thiourea catalyst in a CHCl3/H2O system under basic conditions. The resulting products are obtained in good to high yields (up to 97%) with high enantioselectivity (up to 90.5:9.5 er). Remarkably, compounds that are almost enantiomerically pure can be obtained from the mother liquor after crystallization.

         <title>Benzochalcogenodiazoles, Synthesis, and Applications in Medicinal Chemistry and Photomedicine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzochalcogenodiazoles (BXD) including benzoxadiazoles, benzothiadiazoles, and benzoselenadiazoles are initially mainly designed for optoelectronic materials as electron&#8208;deficient cores. Nevertheless, they are now extending their application to biology. In this review, the synthesis of BXDs and their use in medicinal chemistry as lipophilic aromatics and in photomedicinal chemistry as photosensitizers will be presented.

Benzochalcogenodiazoles (BXDs) (BOD: benzoxadiazole, BTD: benzothiadiazole, or BSD: benzoselenadiazole) are aromatic bicyclic compounds, containing chalcogen atoms, with applications ranging from material to medicinal chemistry. The recent developments in their preparation and functionalization are taking advantage of new methodologies such as C&#63743;H activation and photocatalysis. After being almost restricted to organic semiconductor materials for optoelectronics applications, they are gaining more and more interest in medicinal chemistry as lipophilic aromatic fragments. Their unique optical properties make them attractive in biological imaging and in photomedicine, with emission up to the near&#8208;infrared biological transparency window. The nature of the chalcogen atom influences their optical properties, with sulfur and selenium atoms favoring phototherapy over fluorescence. This review will not describe optoelectronic materials and fluorophores based on BXD but will focus on the preparation of BXD&#8208;containing compounds, and their medicinal and photomedicinal applications.

         <title>Streamlining Vorinostat Synthesis: A Chemoenzymatic Continuous Flow Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoenzymatic protocol for the synthesis of histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat has been established. Immobilized lipase from C. antarctica (imm&#8208;CaLB) allowed the functionalization of suberanoyl acid 1 and further conversion to vorinostat via ion&#8208;exchange resin treatment. The continuous flow system affords vorinostat in high yield, avoiding chromatographic purifications, shortening the reaction time and minimizing solvent usage and waste production.

Anticancer agent vorinostat is one of the only three commercialized histone deacetylase inhibitors approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of cutaneous T&#8208;cell lymphoma. Several synthetic pathways and only one biocatalytic approach have been designed over the years. However, no chemoenzymatic approaches have been described to date. Herein, the first two&#8208;step protocol for the obtainment of vorinostat is presented, which combines the chemical acylation of aniline followed by the lipase&#8208;catalyzed (immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica) condensation and the final hydrolysis with an acidic resin. Initially, batch studies allow to obtain vorinostat in high yield (70%) in 16&#8201;h using eco&#8208;friendly t&#8208;amyl alcohol as the reaction medium. Subsequently, the protocol is transferred to a continuous flow reactor, which reduces the overall time to 4&#8201;h while keeping the same final yield. Furthermore, the developed procedure minimizes solvent waste and enhances system automation, paving the way for a feasible application to further hydroxamic acid moieties of pharmaceutical interest.

         <title>Photoinduced Copper&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Arylation Reaction of N&#63743;H Heteroarenes Using Aryl Thianthrenium Salts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted copper&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;arylation protocol is described that enables direct C&#63743;N bond construction between N&#63743;H heteroarenes and arenes by the use of aryl thianthrenium salts. This photoactivation strategy demonstrates extensive substrate scope and offers a means to retain an activated functional group (such as Br, CHO, and CN) for subsequent derivatization reactions.

Herein, an efficient photoinduced copper&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;arylation reaction is presented, which occurs through the cross&#8208;coupling of N&#63743;H heteroarenes with aryl thianthrenium salts (Ar&#8208;TTs). This photoactivation strategy exhibits broad substrate scope and offers a method for preserving activated functional groups (such as Br, CHO, and CN) for subsequent derivatization reactions.

Fluorescent Bis&#8208;Dihydropyridine Hybrids: Design, Synthesis, and Redox Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, photophysical, and electrochemical properties of hybrid derivatives of nonsymmetrical bis&#8208;dihydropyridines are described. These compounds are obtained by multicomponent Hantzsch ester synthesis followed by a click reaction. Interestingly, photophysical and electrochemical properties of this class of compounds will allow them to be considered for potential applications in biological processes and their potential antioxidant activity.

A set of eight fluorescent symmetric and nonsymmetric bis&#8208;dihydropyridine hybrid molecules (DHP&#8211;DHP) are designed and synthesized through the sequential multicomponent Hantzsch ester synthesis followed by the azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition reaction methodology with the formation of a nonenolizable triazole linker between the two dihydropyridine portions. The luminescence properties are evaluated by absorption and fluorescence emission (steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved) techniques, aided by density functional theory calculations. The redox properties of this new series of DHP derivatives are also evaluated.

         <title>NNN Palladium(II)Pincer Complex in a Borrowing Hydrogen Process: Alkylation of Indoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NNN&#8211;Pd(II) pincer complex is utilized in the selective synthesis of C3&#8208;alkylated indoles as well as the synthesis of bis(indolyl)methanes by tuning the reaction conditions using the same substrates. The control experiments and quantum chemical analysis suggest that C3 functionalization of indole involves a &#8220;borrowing hydrogen process.&#8221;

Recently, an azine NNN&#8211;Pd(II) nonpalindromic pincer complex is generated, and its application in acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling is explored. This article establishes the application of the same pincer complex in the borrowing hydrogen process (BHP). Herein, the selective synthesis of C3 alkylated indoles (CAIs) is reported. Remarkably, this catalyst enables the synthesis of bis(indolyl)methanes (BIMs) by tuning the reaction conditions using the same substrates. The control experiments and quantum chemical analysis suggest that C3 functionalization of indole involves BHP. The formation of BIMs is an additional advantage.

         <title>Photoinduced Reaction of Diiodoperfluoroalkanes with Aromatic Compounds: Divergent Synthesis of Two Product Types</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of aromatic compounds with diiodoperfluoroalkanes are investigated, and it is found that different products can be synthesized depending on the reaction conditions and amounts of reagents. In particular, the reaction of 1,4&#8208;diiodoperfluorobutane under UV irradiation provides unique cyclic perfluoroalkyl aromatic compounds.

Both UV&#8208;light&#8208;promoted and organic&#8208;dye&#8208;catalyzed visible light&#8208;promoted reactions of diiodoperfluoroalkanes with an iodine substituent at both ends and substituted anilines are attempted. In the reactions with 1,6&#8208; and 1,8&#8208;diiodoperfluoroalkanes in the presence of an excess amount of aniline, both ends of the iodide reacts to give a diamine, and the reaction with an excess amount of diiodide gives a monoiodide, in which one end of the diiodide has reacted with the aniline. In contrast, in the case of the 1,4&#8208;diiodoperfluoroalkane, the UV reaction yields cyclization products in which both ends of the diiodine has reacted with the same aromatic ring, while the visible light reaction yields products in which only one end has reacted. Since synthetic examples of such cyclization products are limited, the reaction with various aromatic compounds is tried and it has been shown that it is effective for electron&#8208;rich aromatic rings. The mechanism of these reactions is discussed and the importance of the redox potential of the iodides is pointed out.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Multicomponent Reactions for the Synthesis of Diverse Heterocyclic Frameworks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review reports the state of the art of light&#8208;promoted reactions (blue, white, and green light), published in last five years (2021 up until the current date), in which either photocatalyst or no photocatalyst are required for the effective synthesis of divergent heterocyclic scaffolds under visible catalysis via multicomponent reactions.

The characteristics of visible light, including its sustainability, eco&#8208;friendliness, and potential for renewable energy, have made visible light&#8208;powered catalysis an intriguing research topic of great interest. In this case, photoredox catalysis uses a single&#8208;electron transfer mechanism under mild reaction conditions to produce very reactive radical species with frequently unusual reactivities. This work is the most comprehensive review of photochemical methods for producing divergent heterocycles through multicomponent reactions, covering important developments since 2021. This review is structured according to the kind of synthesized heterocyclic scaffold. Additionally, different study findings&#8217; scopes, limitations, and mechanistic studies are covered.

         <title>Recent Advances in Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Sulfinyl Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in catalytic preparation of chiral sulfinyl compounds via transition&#8208;metal&#8208;, organo&#8208;, and biocatalysis are summarized. This review comprises applications in catalytic asymmetric synthesis of various types of enantiopure sulfinyl derivatives (including sulfoxides, sulfinate esters, sulfinamides, and sulfoximines) and is arranged according to the catalytic types.

Chiral sulfinyl architectures have emerged as one of most important structural motifs in modern drug and agrochemical discovery due to their unique physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. They are also recognized as versatile platforms for novel chiral ligands, organocatalysts, and auxiliaries in asymmetric synthesis. Benefitting from the development of transition metal catalysis, organocatalysis, and biocatalysis technologies in recent years, attention has exploited to new tactics for the asymmetric construction of chiral sulfinyl compounds and their derivatives. This review highlights the advances in the field of catalytic preparation of enantiopure sulfinyl derivatives (including sulfoxides, sulfinate esters, sulfinamides, and sulfoximines) since 2020, with an emphasis on the substrate scope, mechanistic aspect, unmet challenges, and future opportunities.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Carboxylation of Aryl Boronates in Supercritical CO2</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carboxylation using stable and abundant CO2 as a carbon source would be an attractive option in synthetic organic chemistry if the use of highly reactive organometals or toxic and expensive transition metals can be avoided. Herein we report a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free direct carboxylation of aryl trialkoxyboronates in supercritical CO2 (scCO2), promoted by a catalytic amount of ZnO. The use of cage&#8208;shaped trialkoxyboronates, which are both nucleophilic and soluble in scCO2, is the key to this reaction. DFT calculations indicate that the high pressure and high temperature of scCO2 with the ZnO catalyst compensate for the high activation energy of direct carboxylation of the boronates.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Rhamnose&#8208;Modified Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;Containing Saponins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of triterpenoid saponins bearing a Lewis&#8208;X trisaccharide analogue, in which the fucose residue is replaced by a rhamnose, is presented. These saponins, designed as negative controls in dendritic cell&#8208;specific intercellular adhesion molecule&#8208;3&#8208;grabbing nonintegrin&#8208;targeted therapeutic applications, are prepared through iterative and convergent glycosylation strategies, achieving good overall yields and complete control over stereoselectivity.

The synthesis of betulinic acid and echinocystic acid saponins featuring an unnatural analogue of the Lewis&#8208;X trisaccharide, in which the l&#8208;fucose residue is replaced by l&#8208;rhamnose, is reported. These triterpenoid saponins are designed as negative controls for dendritic cell&#8208;specific intercellular adhesion molecule&#8208;3&#8208;grabbing nonintegrin&#8208;targeted antiviral and immunological studies. The target saponins are synthesized using both iterative and convergent strategies, requiring nine and six steps, respectively, for the longest linear sequence starting from allyl betulinate and allyl echinocystate. Glycosylation reactions are performed using trihalogenoacetimidate and thioglycoside donors, which provide excellent yields and complete control over stereoselectivity. This work establishes a robust foundation for the synthesis of lupane&#8208; and oleanane&#8208;type triterpenoid saponins incorporating Lewis&#8208;X trisaccharide analogues.

         <title>Green&#8208;Light Cerium Photocatalysis Enabled by Pyridine N&#8208;Oxide Ligands</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridine N&#8208;oxides are found to be hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer ligands in cerium photocatalysis. Compared to previous described systems, the corresponding photoactive cerium(IV)&#8208;complex exhibits a distinct bathochromic shift, which enables the CH&#8208;hydrazination of small molecules with green light.

Pyridine N&#8208;oxides are reported as neutral ligands in cerium photocatalysis. By using those neutral ligands, photoactive Ce(IV)&#8208;species are generated, which show an extensive bathochromic shift compared to previously employed cerium&#8208;based complexes. This allows the effective utilization of green light in the redox&#8208;neutral CH&#8208;hydrazination of small molecules under very mild photocatalytic conditions.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Diastereoselective Radical Ring Opening of Bicyclobutanes to 1,1,3,3&#8208;Tetrasubstituted Cyclobutanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NHC&#8208;catalyzed radical ring opening of bicyclobutanes with readily accessible aldehydes and Togni I regents to afford 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetrasubstituted CF3&#8208;containing cyclobutanes is developed, which exhibits exclusive regioselectivity and up to excellent diastereoselectivity under mild conditions.

Herein, the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed ring opening of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) with aldehydes and Togni I reagents through a three&#8208;component radical relay process is reported, which affords 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetrasubstituted cyclobutanes. This reaction exhibits exclusive regioselectivity and up to excellent diastereoselectivity under mild and operating&#8208;simple conditions. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and several product derivatizations demonstrate their potential utilities as versatile building blocks in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Synthesis of Soluble Nickel&#8211;Salphen Ligand Complexes as Near&#8208;Infrared Dyes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five soluble nickel&#8208;salphen&#8208;type near&#8208;infrared dyes are synthesized by expanding the conjugation and introducing substituent groups. After the introduction of thiophene and electron&#8208;withdrawing terminal groups, these complexes exhibit a red shift in absorption, along with enhanced solubility in polar solvents and superior photothermal stability.

Salphen metal complexes have the advantages of simple synthesis, high stability, and excellent optical properties. However, their poor solubility, severe aggregation, and short absorption wavelengths limit their application as near&#8208;infrared dyes. In this study, five soluble Ni&#8211;salphen complexes with strong NIR absorption are synthesized by introducing alkyl chains and extending conjugated cores. The results show that the introduction of thiophene and electron&#8208;withdrawing end&#8208;groups has resulted in the red&#8208;shifted absorption of these complexes, with the absorption edge reaching 800&#8201;nm. These compounds have well solubility in organic solvents, more soluble than 8&#8201;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1 in chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, etc. The target molecules also have excellent photostability and thermal stability (Td&#8201;&gt;&#8201;325 &#176;C).

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Base mediated 1,2&#8208;addition/oxa&#8208;Michael reaction sequence for the synthesis of sulfonylated isochromene is developed. The role of solvent is found to be crucial for the transformation. The method is extrapolated for the naphthalene and isocoumarine synthesis.

A base&#8208;promoted annulation via 1,2&#8208;addition/alkyne&#8208;allene isomerization/oxa&#8208;Michael cyclization of sulfonyl enynals for the synthesis of sulfonylated isochromene is developed. The choice of solvent plays a crucial role in this transformation to give the sulfonylated iscohromenes. The reaction mechanism is supported by the react&#8208;IR experiment. To emphasize the practical utility, the sulfonylated isochromene is deftly elaborated into diversely substituted naphthalene and isocoumarine.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Selective Desulfurization of Thioamides in Water and an Open System</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel protocol of selective desulfurization of thioamides to amines with dimethylaminoborane (DMAB) without catalysts, operating in neat water under an open system, is studied.

The selective reduction of the unsaturated substrates in green solvent is highly desired yet however, remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Especially the selective desulfurization of thioamides usually requires hazardous highly reactive reagents or transition metal catalysts in high&#8208;pressure conditions. Herein, a novel protocol of selective desulfurization of thioamides to amines with dimethylaminoborane (DMAB) without catalysts, operating in neat water under an open system, is presented. Notably, the selectivity of the reaction is effectively controlled with a simple Lewis acid additive through computational design. The combination of density functional theory and experimental mechanism studies reveals the important synergistic cooperation by DMAB and Lewis acid additive to facilitate the hydrogenative desulfurization process in an aqueous solution.

         <title>Synthesis of a Library of Bifunctional N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligand Precursors with Hydrogen Bond Donor Subunits</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward two&#8208;step synthesis to bifunctional precursors of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) is developed. Based on this, a library of imidazolium&#8208;based NHCs, with a variety of hydrogen bond donor groups in the backbone is prepared. The utility of the bifunctional NHC ligands is demonstrated in transition metal catalysis with the resulting palladium(II) and copper(I) complexes.

Bifunctional N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) with additional hydrogen bond donor groups in the backbone are important organocatalysts and ligands for transition metal complexes. Herein, a straightforward synthetic approach to a library of bifunctional imidazolium salts, precursors for the respective NHCs with amidine, squaramide, and (thio)urea moieties as hydrogen bond donors, is reported. The preparation of bifunctional palladium(II) and copper(I) NHC complexes and their application in catalysis is presented.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Induced Trifluoromethylation of (Hetero)Arenes by Using SF6 as an Oxidant</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light&#8208;driven trifluoromethylation protocol using SF6 as an oxidant has been developed. This method achieves regioselective C(sp2)&#8211;CF3 bond formation under mild conditions with Rose Bengal catalyst, blue LEDs and bench&#8208;stable CF3SO2Na. The reaction affords moderate to excellent yields across various (hetero)arenes, which facilitates the efficient utilization and degradation of the potent greenhouse gas SF6.

As a potent greenhouse gas, SF6 remains an underexplored oxidant despite its strong electronegativity. In this work, a visible light&#8208;driven trifluoromethylation protocol using SF6 as an oxidant has been developed. This method achieves regioselective C(sp2)&#8211;CF3 bond formation under mild conditions with Rose Bengal catalyst, blue LEDs and bench&#8208;stable CF3SO2Na, facilitating efficient utilization and degradation of the greenhouse gas SF6.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;Pyridone is a crucial building block in bioactive natural products and serves as a vital intermediate for the synthesis of bioactive nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. Recent advancements in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization have enabled the direct modification of 2&#8208;pyridones, circumventing the need for pre&#8208;functionalization. In this study, we report a Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed, C6&#8208;selective C&#8211;H heteroarylation of 2&#8208;pyridones using cyclic iodonium ylides as carbene precursors.

         <dc:description>
An aryl&#8208;to&#8208;alkyl 1,4&#8208;palladium migration/Sonogashira coupling reaction has been developed. By extensive optimization of the reaction conditions, the regioselectivity was effectively modulated and allowed the synthesis of migratory alkynylation products in moderate to good yields.

This study presents the successful development of an aryl&#8208;to&#8208;alkyl 1,4&#8208;palladium migration/Sonogashira coupling reaction, enabling the synthesis of migratory alkynylation products in moderate to good yields. The regioselectivity is effectively modulated through extensive optimization of reaction conditions. Mechanistic investigations, supported by stoichiometric experiments with palladium complexes, provide insights into the catalytic cycle and the migratory pathway.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Tetrahydropyridines via Borrowing Hydrogen Strategy</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a manganese&#8208;catalyzed borrowing hydrogen cyclization of secondary alcohols with &#947;&#8208;amino alcohols in a practical synthesis of 2,3,4,5&#8208;tetrahydropyridines is reported. A wide range of different 1&#8208;substituted ethanols&#160;and 3&#8208;amino alcohols could undergo the homogenous manganese&#8208;catalyzed process smoothly and furnish the corresponding products with overall moderate to good yields.

Tetrahydropyridines are versatile compounds widely used in organic synthesis and drug manufacturing. Herein, a manganese&#8208;catalyzed borrowing hydrogen coupling of 1&#8208;substituted ethanol derivatives with &#947;&#8208;amino alcohols is reported. This novel protocol has a broad substrate scope with good functional group tolerance and affords a diverse library of valuable 2,6&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydropyridines in moderate to good yields. Mechanistically, the reaction proceeds sequentially through catalytic dehydrogenation, dual cross&#8208;condensation, and further hydrogenation of the formed unsaturated intermediates to yield the desired tetrahydropyridines.

         <title>New Glycoconjugates Containing Selenium and Polyphenols. Stereoselective Synthesis by Pummerer&#8208;like Rearrangement.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two series of novel six&#8208;membered Se&#8208;glycoconjugates containing hydroxycinnamic acids marked by well&#8208;known antioxidant properties are synthesized, exploiting a Mitsunobu reaction and a Pummerer&#8208;like rearrangement. A first example of six&#8208;membered selenosugar with selenium in the ring and bearing an acetal&#8208;like functional group at C&#8208;1 was reported, which is a useful precursor of hydrolytically stable oligosaccharide and nucleoside mimics.

In the last 20&#8201;years the exploitation of antioxidant activity of selenobased compounds has improved, just due to the use of Ebselen, a selenocompound, as a Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) mimic. However, their clinical use seems to be compromised by the low solubility in water. To deal with this problem, it is possible to take advantage of the new approach including selenosugars in which selenium replaces heterocyclic oxygen. In this frame, to optimize the antioxidant properties of selenosugars, the glycoconjugation with a polyphenolic unit, which is a molecule capable of inhibiting or disabling the action of free radicals, has been considered in this work. The Mitsunobu reaction mechanism links covalently the primary alcoholic function of selenobased glycosyl donors, coming from the commercially available d&#8208;mannose, and phenolic moiety acceptors, to obtain the corresponding glycoconjugates, has been exploited affording the products in efficient yields. A density functional theory (DFT) theoretical study is carried out to help understand the possible influence of the seleno donor on the reactivity. Crucially, a new pathway based on Pummerer&#8208;like rearrangement followed by a glycosylation, gave a selenosugar with selenium in the ring and bearing an acetal&#8208;like functional group at C&#8208;1. All compounds are characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy confirming their structures and purity.

Attempting to address the growing synthetic complexity (SC) of conjugated polymers, the interdependent syntheses of the common acceptors 4,7&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (Br2BTD), 5,8&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihexylquinoxaline (Br2Qx), and 4,7&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2H&#8208;benzotriazole (Br2BTA) are all revisited. The SC Index is determined for both the traditional and optimized syntheses, showing improvements in the generation of all three acceptors.

In an attempt to address the growing problem of synthetic complexity in conjugated organic polymers, the synthesis of the common acceptor units 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (BTD), quinoxaline (Qx), and 2H&#8208;benzotriazole (BTA) have been revisited, along with their dibromo derivatives necessary for use in catalytic cross&#8208;coupling. In addition to reducing the total number of synthetic steps, efforts have been made to reduce hazardous reagents and simplify purification. Synthetic complexity index values for both established and newly reported methods are then generated in order to provide a qualitative evaluation of the reduced contribution of these common building blocks to the synthetic complexity of all materials that contain them.

         <title>Escape from Flatland: Pericyclic Reactions and Rearrangements of Diazofluorene with Biarylcyclooctynes for the Generation of Helicene&#8208;Like Phenanthro&#8208;Pyrazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the voyage of two flat, highly unsaturated systems into the third dimension. Specifically, we investigated the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of 9&#8208;diazofluorene with a rapidly growing class of strained dipolarophile&#8212;biarylcyclooctynes. We found that the initial spirocyclic 3H&#8208;pyrazole cycloadducts are isolable, and can be subjected to controllable [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic shifts. These van Alphen&#8211;H&#252;ttel rearrangements generate either the metastable 4H&#8208;pyrazoles&#8212;another spirocyclic fused&#8208;ring system with a highly contorted structure&#8212;or the thermodynamically favored 1H&#8208;pyrazoles. The 1H&#8208;pyrazoles display extended conjugation and can be classified as [5]&#8208;helicenes containing a phenanthro&#8208;pyrazole fused to a dihydro&#8208;cyclooctatetraene. Overall, these studies provide a modular framework to control heteroatom placement, ring size, and ring fusion in the syntheses of carbon&#8208;rich materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem Synthesis of Pyrrolidine and Piperidine Derivatives from Propargylic Alcohols Under Multimetallic Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 2&#8208;carbonylmethyl substituted pyrrolidines and piperidines can be accessed from readily available propargylic alcohols and N&#8208;protected amino olefins through a tandem Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement/olefin cross&#8208;metathesis/intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition under Au and Ru catalysis. The stereochemical outcome of the Au&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition is kinetically controlled and depended on the nitrogen protecting group.

Herein reported is tandem synthesis of 2&#8208;carbonylmethyl pyrrolidine/piperidine derivatives from propargylic alcohols under multimetallic catalysis. A Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement of propargylic alcohols under cationic Au catalysis, followed by in&#8201;situ olefin cross&#8208;metathesis with appropriately protected amino olefins delivered &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, which without isolation underwent an intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition to afford a variety of pyrrolidine and piperidine derivatives. The scope of the present tandem reaction is investigated to show that common amine protecting groups, such as Ts, Ns, Cbz, and Bz, are well tolerated. Addition of a catalytic amount of bismuth(III) triflate is required for promoting the intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition where the N&#8208;protected amino group is less nucleophilic.

&lt;p&gt;A series of 2-carbonylmethyl substituted pyrrolidines and piperidines can be accessed from readily available propargylic alcohols and N-protected amino olefins through a tandem Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement/olefin cross-metathesis/intramolecular aza-Michael addition under Au and Ru catalysis. The stereochemical outcome of the Au-catalyzed intramolecular aza-Michael addition is kinetically controlled and depended on the nitrogen protecting group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein reported is tandem synthesis of 2-carbonylmethyl pyrrolidine/piperidine derivatives from propargylic alcohols under multimetallic catalysis. A Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement of propargylic alcohols under cationic Au catalysis, followed by in&#8201;situ olefin cross-metathesis with appropriately protected amino olefins delivered &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated ketones, which without isolation underwent an intramolecular aza-Michael addition to afford a variety of pyrrolidine and piperidine derivatives. The scope of the present tandem reaction is investigated to show that common amine protecting groups, such as Ts, Ns, Cbz, and Bz, are well tolerated. Addition of a catalytic amount of bismuth(III) triflate is required for promoting the intramolecular aza-Michael addition where the N-protected amino group is less nucleophilic. The stereochemical consequence of the present tandem reaction is found to be dependent on the amine protecting group.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Anion&#8208;Binding&#8208;Catalyzed Nucleophilic Addition to 4&#8208;Quinolones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first organocatalytic enantioselective formal 1,4&#8208;addition to 4&#8208;quinolones has been developed. This method relies on chiral triazole&#8208;based anion&#8208;binding catalysis using enol nucleophiles, complementing previous metal catalytic approaches. Moderate to good yields and enantioselectivities were achieved by in&#8201;situ silylation and formation of a key quinolinium&#8208;catalyst chiral contact ion pair, allowing for chirality transfer to the product upon nucleophilic attack.

Chiral quinolones and their derivatives are predominant synthetic building blocks and pharmacological agents. Nevertheless, their synthesis mostly relies on transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective 1,4&#8208;additions of organometallic reagents such as Grignard, organozinc, or organoboron species for alkylation, arylation, and alkynylation reactions. Herein, the first organocatalytic enantioselective formal 1,4&#8208;addition to challenging 4&#8208;quinolones is reported, upon in&#8201;situ silylation to the corresponding quinolinium ions, followed by asymmetric nucleophilic attack to this type of substrates. This method complements previous metal&#8208;catalyzed approaches by enrolling enol nucleophiles and relies on anion&#8208;binding catalysis using a chiral triazole&#8208;based anion binder. The enantioenriched 2&#8208;substituted 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4&#8208;quinolones were thus obtained in good yields (up to 97% yield) and enantioselectivities up to 89:11 e.r. Finally, the easy access to 4&#8208;amino and &#947;&#8211;amino alcohol derivatives by post&#8208;functionalization, as well as to enantiopure compounds (&gt;99:1 e.r.), was showcased. The notable features of this protocol include its mild reaction conditions, avoiding the use of transition metals, broad functional group tolerance, and potential application toward the synthesis of chiral 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4&#8208;quinolones and tetrahydroquinolines as important skeletons of bioactive and natural products.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Ligand Cooperation for Iron(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Wittig&#8208;Type Olefination from Alcohols in Air</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot in situ alcohol oxidation&#8211;Wittig reaction in air using aphosphine&#8208;free Fe(II) catalyst (1) bearing a redox&#8208;active tridentate arylazo pincer was used to synthesize a broad range of substituted E olefins by dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols and phosphonium ylides. Mechanistic investigations revealed active participation of the arylazo scaffold as an electron and hydrogen reservoir in the catalytic cycle.

An iron&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot tandem in&#8201;situ oxidation&#8211;Wittig reaction is reported for the synthesis of alkenes. Using a bench&#8208;stable Fe(II) catalyst with a redox&#8208;noninnocent 2&#8208;((4&#8208;chlorophenyl)diazenyl)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligand scaffold, a broad spectrum of substituted E olefins is synthesized in good yields by the reaction of alcohols with phosphorus ylides. Control reactions and spectroscopic studies indicate synergistic participation of the ligand, which acts as a reservoir of electrons and hydrogen, during the dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols with the phosphorus ylides.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Allylation and Tandem Allylation&#8211;Cycloisomerization of Stannylated Propargyl Acetates with Allylsilanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and general method for the gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed allylation and tandem allylation&#8211;cycloisomerization of stannylated propargyl acetates with allylsilanes for the synthesis of 1,5&#8208;enynes, with a terminal alkyne, and bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes was developed. Stannylated propargyl acetates proved useful for improving the selective formation of 1,5&#8208;enynes and bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes. The tributylstannyl group is a transient protecting group that prevents side reactions.

Bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes, synthesized by the cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;enynes, serve as key scaffolds in various natural products. Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;enynes is an efficient route to bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes. However, gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed 1,5&#8208;enyne synthesis, particularly with a terminal alkyne, has not yet been fully explored. This study presents a mild and general method for the gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed allylation and tandem allylation&#8211;cycloisomerization of stannylated propargyl acetates with allylsilanes, yielding 1,5&#8208;enynes with terminal alkyne moiety and bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes. The catalytic system ((4&#8208;MeOC6H4)3PAuCl/AgSbF6) enabled the efficient synthesis of 1,5&#8208;enynes with good to high yields and regioselectivities. In addition, gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed tandem allylation&#8211;cycloisomerization using (JohnPhos)Au(MeCN)SbF6 afforded bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes with high regiocontrol. Stannylated propargyl acetates proved crucial in enhancing selectivity for both product classes.

         <title>Electroreductive Intramolecular Heck&#8208;Type Cyclization for the Synthesis of Benzofused Oxygenated Heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electroreductive strategy for synthesizing diverse benzofused oxygenated heterocycles via 5&#8208; or 6&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization. This method eliminates the need for transition&#8208;metal catalysts while suppressing competing hydrogenation and halogenation pathways at the exocyclic carbon radical center. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, exhibits excellent substrate tolerance, and improves atom economy.

Conventional synthetic routes to benzofused oxygenated heterocycles, such as dihydrobenzofuran, chromane, and isochromane derivatives, often involve complex synthetic conditions, high costs, and environmental concerns. The key to addressing this challenge lies in achieving transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C(sp2)&#63743;I bond cleavage to enable intramolecular radical cyclization. Inspired by electroreductive strategies, a convenient, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free electroreductive tandem reaction is developed for synthesizing dihydrobenzofuran, chromane, and isochromane derivatives. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that this approach not only simplifies synthetic conditions but also suppresses competing hydrogenation and halogenation pathways at the exocyclic carbon radical center.

The key to addressing this challenge lies in achieving transition-metal-free C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;I bond cleavage to enable intramolecular radical cyclization. Inspired by electroreductive strategies, a convenient, transition-metal-free electroreductive tandem reaction is developed for synthesizing dihydrobenzofuran, chromane, and isochromane derivatives. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that this approach not only simplifies synthetic conditions but also suppresses competing hydrogenation and halogenation pathways at the exocyclic carbon radical center.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photochemical arylation reactions mediated by a terpyridine cobalt complex</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The complex [CoII(4'&#8209;MeO&#8209;tpy)2](PF6)2 (4'&#8209;MeO&#8209;tpy = 4'&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2,2':6',2''&#8208;terpyridine) effectively mediates visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven arylation of pyrroles, 1,3,5&#8209;trimethoxybenzene and bis(pinacolato)diborane (B2Pin2). Mechanistic studies suggest the reaction likely proceeds via a halogen atom transfer mechanism facilitated by an &#945;&#8209;aminyl radical. This work highlights the potential of optimizing the ligand framework and reaction conditions to advance the application of earth&#8208;abundant transition metal complexes in photoredox catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>SnCl2&#8208;Catalyzed Phosphorylation of Alcohols and Selective Phosphorylation/Phosphinoylation of Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, stannous chloride catalyzed phosphorylation of alcohols and selective phosphorylation of carbohydrates are explored, giving a new approach to obtain biologically active phosphorylated molecules.

Phosphorylated molecules, particularly phosphorylated carbohydrates, have garnered significant interest due to their distinct biological activities, driving an urgent demand for efficient phosphorylation strategies. Herein, the successful development of a SnCl2&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the phosphorylation of alcohols and carbohydrates is demonstrated. Notably, the reaction efficiency is found to be critically dependent on the addition order of SnCl2 and N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine, a phenomenon systematically investigated through mechanistic studies. A one&#8208;pot sequential ketalization/phosphorylation strategy is established for polyol substrates, enabling streamlined access to phosphorylated derivatives. The versatility of this approach is further exemplified by achieving selective phosphorylation/phosphinoylation of carbohydrates.

         <title>Chemoselective Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated Silyl Esters and Silyl Phosphonates Over Cyclopropanation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated silyl esters are an important class of compounds in organic, inorganic and pharmaceutical chemistry, known for their versatility and unique reactivity. The conjugated system in these compounds enables for Michael addition reactions, making them useful intermediates in the synthesis of complex organic/inorganic molecules, including pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and natural products. Having realized the importance of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated silyl esters, we have devised a strategy to synthesize various functionalized allyl and vinyl silanes using diazo compounds and respective silanes. Herein we have demonstrated that the allyl and vinyl silanes can react with diazo compounds in a chemoselective manner offering a versatile method for constructing C&#8208;C bond formation over the cyclopropanation reaction in the presence of 1 mol% of [Cp*RuCl2]n as a catalyst under mild conditions. Direct C&#8208;H bond functionalization of allyl and vinyl silanes with alpha diazo esters and phosphonate diazo showcasing the adaptability of silicon&#8208;based chemistry in modern organic synthesis. The plausible mechanism of the reaction has been realized with the help of DFT calculations. All the synthesized &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated siliyl esters were isolated and characterized by using sophisticated analytical and spectroscopic techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Transition Metal&#8208;Free Strategies for the Transformation of Amides into Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This comprehensive review articulates the recent advances in transition metal&#8208;free methodologies for amide bond activation. By integrating mechanistic insights with synthetic applications, it delineates sustainable strategies for the construction of carbonyl frameworks. Emphasis is placed on nucleophilic substitution, radical&#8208;mediated processes, and catalyst&#8208;driven approaches, providing a valuable resource for the efficient transformation of amides into esters, ketones, imides, and aldehydes.

Amides are fundamental functional groups in organic synthesis and play crucial roles in medicinal chemistry and materials science. Traditionally, amide transformations have often relied on transition metal catalysts; however, recent advances have demonstrated efficient transition metal&#8208;free strategies for amide bond activation. This review provides a comprehensive overview of emerging methodologies that enable selective formation of C&#63743;N, C&#63743;C, C&#63743;O, C&#63743;H, and C&#63743;X bonds. Key developments that offer sustainable and practical alternatives to conventional approaches include borate&#8208; and boronic acid&#8208;mediated transamidations, phosphoric acid&#8208;promoted transformations, and radical&#8208;based strategies. Additionally, nucleophilic substitutions with carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen&#8208;based nucleophiles have expanded the synthetic utility of amides by yielding diverse carbonyl and heterocyclic compounds. Mechanistic insights into these transformations reveal the role of electronic and steric effects in amide reactivity. By categorizing these methodologies based on amide substrates and reaction pathways, this review aims to provide a valuable resource for researchers seeking efficient, metal&#8208;free strategies for amide bond manipulation.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Ectocarpin A</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully enantioselective total synthesis of ectocarpin A, a new oxylipin, has been achieved in 12 steps starting from tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;cyclopentafuranone. Key steps include the formation of the chiral core, diastereoselective epoxidation, enzymatic desymmetrization of a 1,4&#8208;diol, epimerization, and strategic Wittig and Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefinations to construct the carbon framework.

A total enantioselective synthesis of ectocarpin A, an oxylipin identified through the first hydroperoxide bicyclase activity of CYP5164A3 in brown algae, has been successfully completed in 12 steps starting from tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;cyclopentafuranone. Key transformations include the creation of the chiral tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;cyclopentafuranone, a diastereoselective epoxidation, an enzymatic desymmetrization of a 1,4&#8208;diol, an epimerization, and both Wittig and Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefinations to build the carbon framework of ectocarpin A.

&lt;p&gt;A fully enantioselective total synthesis of ectocarpin A, a new oxylipin, has been achieved in 12 steps starting from tetrahydro-1H-cyclopentafuranone. Key steps include the formation of the chiral core, diastereoselective epoxidation, enzymatic desymmetrization of a 1,4-diol, epimerization, and strategic Wittig and Julia-Kocienski olefinations to construct the carbon framework.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ring&#8208;Rearrangement&#8208;Driven Formal (3+2) Cycloaddition of Enaminone&#8208;Based Thioalkynes with Nitriles to Form Thiazole&#8208;Containing Bis&#8208;heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydropyridin&#8208;2(H)&#8208;one containing thiazole derivatives by Bronsted acid&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;rearrangement and formal (3+2) cycloaddition reaction of enaminone&#8208;based thioalkyne with alkyl/aryl nitrile. The developed protocol demonstrates a wide substrate scope for both the reacting partners with high atom&#8208;economy furnishing very high to excellent yields of pharmaceutically relevant bis&#8208;heterocyclic derivatives. Based on outcome of the product and control experiments, a plausible reaction mechanism has also been proposed. The gram&#8208;scale synthesis and further synthetic transformation demonstrate the synthetic efficacy and utility of the developed protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Dioxygenation of gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes to Generate &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes are valuable synthetic intermediates in organofluorine chemistry; however, their reactivity often involves intermediates prone to fluorine elimination, leading to monofluorinated products. Here, we present a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed dioxygenation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes with alcohols, which retains both fluorine atoms and yields &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers. This method is operationally simple, employs inexpensive and standard reagents, and demonstrates broad functional group tolerance. The reaction is scalable, enabling the use of the gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropane motif as a masked precursor for &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers in synthetic sequences. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest a radical&#8208;mediated process involving concerted SN2&#8208;like ring&#8208;opening functionalization.</dc:description>
