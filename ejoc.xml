         <title>Hydroxymethyl&#8208;Substituted Tetrathiatriarylmethanol with Variable Reactivity: Selective Access to Three Different Trityl Radicals by Unique Acid&#8208;Mediated Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrathiatriarylmethyl radicals have found wide applications in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and imaging as well as dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). Recently, intense effort has been devoted to the derivatization of trityl radicals, but there is still a lack of highly efficient methods for access to these radicals. Herein, we report novel acid&#8208;mediated protocols for straightforward and selective synthesis of the hydroxymethyl, aldehyde and methyl derivatives of trityl radicals from the sole substrate hydroxymethyl&#8208;substituted tetrathiatriarylmethanol. The resulting trityl radicals exhibit various redox properties as shown by their cyclic voltammetric results. Importantly, the use of these protocols enables site&#8208;specific deuteration of the three trityl radicals, which show unique EPR spectral properties. Overall, our study reveals the crucial effect of the acids on the synthesis of these trityl radicals and provides a new approach for selective access to different trityl radicals, thus enriching their synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Recycling of Polycarbonates via Ammonolysis and Polycaprolactones by KOH&#8208;Catalyzed Methanolysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple chemical method for the depolymerization of two polyesters namely, poly(bisphenol A carbonate) and poly (&#1013;&#8208;caprolactone) has been developed. The reaction conditions are devoid of any heavy metal catalysts and simple to perform at large scale.







Abstract
Chemical recycling polymer waste is a highly required technology to follow the current carbon&#8208;neutral trend. Here, we present practical recycling methods for poly (bisphenol A carbonate) (PC) and poly(&#1013;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL). PC can be converted to bisphenol A and urea with excellent product yield at 80&#8201;&#176;C via ammonolysis using ammonium salt (ammonium&#8208;formate or &#8208;carbonate) instead of liquid ammonia that is usually used in previous PC recycling. PCL can be converted to methyl 6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;hexanoate monomer with excellent yield at 80&#8201;&#176;C via methanolysis catalyzed by KOH.

         <title>Boron Complexes of Tridentate Acyl Pyridylhydrazones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the development of the chemistry and applications of boron dipyrromethene dyes (BODIPYs), numerous other platforms based on boron complexes of N&#8208;donor ligands have emerged as molecular optoelectronic materials. By tailoring the structure of the ligand bound to boron, the optical and electronic properties of a compound can be precisely tuned for unique properties, such as aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) in the case of boron difluoride hydrazones (BODIHYs). We examine the impact of modifying the typical bidentate hydrazone ligand structure used to prepare BODIHYs to enable a tridentate coordination mode to produce boron complexes of tridentate acyl pyridylhydrazones. This change allows for the use of arylboronic acids as sources of boron and facilitates the inclusion of complex organic components at the boron centre, including the formation of dye&#8208;dye conjugates. The synthesized compounds exhibit distinct optical and electronic properties when compared to BODIHYs, such as reversible electrochemical reduction and up to a &gt;300 nm pseudo&#8208;Stokes shift in the solid state, all of which were supported by density functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitration of Pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines with NaNO2/HFIP</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A&#160;mild&#160;nitration of&#160;pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines has been reached using sodium nitrite as nitro source in HFIP at ambient temperature. A variety of nitro&#8208;bearing pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline derivatives has been efficiently prepared in poor to quantitative yields&#160;(28&#8208;98%).&#160;These products can be easily transformed to primary amines and amide by simple chemical reactions. Treatment of other nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles such as&#160;pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoline&#160;and substituted indoles under this developed reaction system afforded nitro&#8208;bearing N&#8208;heterocycles in relatively lower yields (15&#8208;19%).</dc:description>

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Functionalization/Cyclization Reactions of Cycloalkanols under Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cycloalkanols ring&#8208;opening functionalization/cyclization reactions are efficient approaches for preparation of a wide range of distally substituted ketones and structurally valuable cyclic compounds, respectively. This mini&#8208;review summarizes the recent progress in ring&#8208;opening transformation of cycloalkanols under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Cycloalkanols ring&#8208;opening transformation is one of the most valuable and wide area of research. Among the numerous methods that have been developed, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free approaches have attracted great interest from both chemists and pharmacologists. This is largely due to the advantages of being environmentally benign, cost&#8208;effective and operationally simple. Here we provide a comprehensive outline on recent advances in the synthesis of distally substituted ketones and cyclic compounds via ring&#8208;opening transformation of cycloalkanols under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Induced Photoredox and Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;N Cross&#8208;Coupling: A Mechanistic Perspective</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article explores the recent achievements and mechanistic development made in the field of photoredox/copper&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling covering several reactions including, decarboxylative, multicomponent, Ullman type coupling, alkylation, and arylation reactions.







Abstract
The formation of C&#8722;N bonds is a vital technique in organic synthesis for creating nitrogen&#8208;containing motifs, which has extensive uses in agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and natural products. Significant progress has been made in constructing C&#8722;N bonds using transition metal catalysis. Nevertheless, utilizing alkyl substrates for the formation of Csp3&#8722;N bonds is a notable challenge. Synergistic photoredox and copper catalysis have proven to be a powerful tool to tackle this challenge. The development of this research domain is still in its early stages owing to the chemical and technical complexities of this catalytic process. This review attempts to summarize in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of the photoredox/copper dual catalysed C&#8722;N coupling reactions taking into consideration of recently reported experimental and theoretical studies.

         <title>Synthesis, Structures, and Electrochemical and Optical Properties of Vinyl&#8208;Extended Tetrathiafulvalene Functionalized with Two 2,6&#8208;Dicyano&#8208; &#955; 5&#8208;Phosphinine Units</title>

         <dc:description>Derivatives of&#160;vinyl&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) functionalized two 2,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;&#955;5&#8208;phosphinine units&#160;(3a&#8208;c) have been successfully synthesized. Cyclic voltammograms of all the derivatives are composed of three&#8208;pairs of redox waves.The first and second redox waves correspond to one&#8208;electron transfer processes, in which the extended TTF moiety participated predominantly. The third redox wave corresponded to a&#160;two&#8208;electron transfer process, in which the two 2,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;&#955;5&#8208;phosphinine units were involved.&#160;The redox potentials&#160;at which the tetracations of&#160;3a&#8208;c&#160;were generated&#160;were considerably more negative than expected, probably due to the formation of stable closed&#8208;shell structures by conjugation between 2,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;&#955;5&#8208;phosphinine units.&#160;X&#8208;ray structure analyses of&#160;3b,&#160;3c,&#160;and&#160;(3b2+)(Sb2Cl82&#8208;)(C6H5OCH3) revealed that the vinyl&#8208;extended TTF moiety in all the compounds adopts an almost planar structure, while the phosphinine units are significantly inclined to the EBDT plane.&#160;The fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the emission intensity of&#160;3b&#160;was very small in both the neutral and oxidized states.&#160;

         <title>Ring&#8208;Expansion Reactions of the Biomass Derivative Cyrene via Enamine Dihalocyclopropanation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ring&#8208;expansion of Cyrene has been developed via the enamine using a dihalocyclopropanation/ring&#8208;opening approach. The outcome for the ring&#8208;expansion was sensitive to solvent, with the ring&#8208;expansion favored in DMF, giving access to halogenated homologated levoglucosenone. A reductive dehalogenation was observed with extended heating in DMF.







Abstract
A ring&#8208;expansion process for the biomass derivative Cyrene obtained from levoglucosenone has been developed using gem&#8208;dihalocyclopropanes as intermediates. The process involves conversion of Cyrene to an enamine, reaction with an in&#8197;situ generated dihalocarbene, and then ring&#8208;opening. Competition between endocyclic and exocyclic olefinic products was switchable using solvent and temperature, and ring&#8208;expanded alkenyl halides were obtained in 50&#8211;64&#8201;% yield from Cyrene. Under extended heating, dehalogenation occurred giving homologated levoglucosenone in 25&#8201;% overall yield from Cyrene in 3 steps.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Alkylation of N&#8208;Heterocycles with Nitriles via Heteroarylphosphonium Intermediates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzothiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;phosphonium and pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;phosphonium salts react with nitrile anions via a proposed nucleophilic aromatic substitution pathway which together with the direct synthesis of phosphonium salts from benzothiazoles and pyridines constitutes an efficient and simple two&#8208;step protocol for C&#8722;H functionalization of these heterocycles.







Abstract
Heteroarylphosphonium salts are easily accessible, versatile intermediates in functionalization of N&#8208;heterocycles. Direct C&#8722;C bond formation by net substitution of the phosphine has so far required transition metal catalysts, the use of strongly basic reagents or redox catalysis. Here we describe a C&#8722;C bond formation in direct reactions of benzothiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;phosphonium and pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;phosphonium salts and nitrile anions which, together with the direct synthesis of phosphonium salts from benzothiazoles and pyridines, constitutes an efficient and simple two&#8208;step protocol for C&#8722;H functionalization of these heterocycles under mild conditions.

         <dc:description>
Fluorinated triarylboranes are employed as a metal free and sustainable catalysts for alkylation of 2&#8208;phenylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones.







Abstract
Fluorinated triarylboranes have shown a breadth of reactivity as catalysts for organic transformations, particularly in carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming reactions. Herein we report a facile, metal&#8208;free synthetic route for the addition of 2&#8208;phenylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones using B(C6F5)3 as a metal&#8208;free catalyst. 25 examples of reactions leading to products in up to 97&#8201;% yield are reported. DFT studies show the role of B(C6F5)3 and hydrogen shuttling in the mechanism of this Michael alkylation.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, green and metal&#8208;free hypervalent iodine mediated approach for the synthesis of pyrroloquinolinediones from ortho&#8208;carbonyl anilines and maleimides in one&#8208;pot manner at room temperature has been developed. H2O as the only by&#8208;product generated during the reaction, displays a high atom economy.







Abstract
An effective, green, mild, and metal&#8208;free hypervalent iodine&#8208;mediated approach for the synthesis of pyrroloquinolinediones from ortho&#8208;carbonyl anilines and maleimides in a one&#8208;pot manner at room temperature has been developed. This proposed protocol can synthesize biologically active pyrroloquinolinediones in a one&#8208;pot manner utilizing readily available starting materials. This protocol generates H2O as the only by&#8208;product during the reaction and shows a high atom economy. Operational simplicity, moderate reaction conditions, high atom economy, and high yield are some key features of this protocol.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Intramolecular Arylation of 1,2&#8208;Disubtituted Epoxides with Tuneable Stereoselectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method of stereodivergent intramolecular ring&#8208;opening arylation of amine&#8208;tethered epoxides to 3,4&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydroquinolines has been developed. The tuneable good stereoselectivity was attained by switching the catalyst from titanocene(III) to Lewis&#8211;acidic zinc catalyst.

         <title>Yttrium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydroamination of Norbornene with Simple Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydroamination of norbornene with simple amines remains a major challenge. Now the hydroamination of norbornene with such simple amines is reported, as well as the first rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of norbornenes.







Abstract
The intermolecular hydroamination of norbornene with simple amines was achieved using silyl&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;terphenoxide yttrium complexes. Excellent conversion was obtained for both benzylic and aliphatic amines. For benzyl and linear aliphatic amines, the highest activity was observed for the sterically more encumbered methyldiphenylsilyl&#8208;substituted complex, whereas the trimethylsilyl&#8208;substituted complex was more active for sterically encumbered primary amines.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Isoxazolo[5,4&#8208;b]pyridines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tandem reactions of 5&#8208;aminoisoxazoles with &#946;,&#947;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;imino esters provided two types of isoxazolopyridines in moderate to good yields by using two different silver salts and a phosphoric acid as catalysts.







Abstract
Isoxazolopyridines are highly significant for the development of pharmaceuticals and new materials. In continuation of our ongoing research on transformations of 5&#8208;aminoisoxazoles, we report herein a divergent synthesis of two kinds of novel isoxazolo[5,4&#8208;b] pyridines through condensation of 5&#8208;aminoisoxazoles with &#946;,&#947;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;imino esters. By using two different silver salts and a phosphoric acid as catalysts, isoxazolo[5,4&#8208;b] pyridine&#8208;&#945;&#8208;carboxylates and isoxazolo[5,4&#8208;b] pyridine&#8208;&#947;&#8208;carboxylates were constructed as major isomers in moderate to good yields, respectively. The structures of the two kinds of the isoxazolo[5,4&#8208;b] pyridines were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystal structural analysis. Furthermore, control experiments were conducted to elucidate the reaction mechanism.

         <title>A General Minisci&#8208;Type Alkylation with Organoboron Derivatives Assisted by Catechol</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed a Minisci&#8208;type strategy for the alkylation of heterocycles with a variety of boron species under low cost and easily scale&#8208;up conditions without the use of transition&#8208;metal or organo&#8208;catalysts. The extension of this strategy to other systems will provide green approaches for the post&#8208;modifications of drug molecules and complex natural products.







Abstract
This manuscript describes a general strategy for the easily scale&#8208;up alkylation of heterocycles with a wide variety of boronic acids, boronates, and trifluoroborate salts under low&#8208;cost and simple conditions without using any transition&#8208;metal or organo&#8208;photocatalysts. The key additive of catechol plays an important role in this method which in&#8208;situ activated a variety of boron&#8208;base species to alkylboronic esters (R&#8208;BCat) with a low oxidation potential. The transformation is distinguished by a broad scope, such as drug molecules and natural products. Furthermore, the methodology proves easily scalable under standard batch conditions, enhancing its practicality and accessibility.

         <dc:description>A thiophane&#8208;catalyzed dibromination of olefins using NBS as the sole bromine source has been developed, providing a low&#8208;cost and mild methodology for preparing vicinally dibrominated compounds from electron&#8208;neutral or &#8208;deficient alkenes. The mechanistic investigation showed that 2,3&#8208;dihydrothiophene generated in situ from the reaction of thiophane with NBS was the actual catalyst, which reversed the polarity of NBS to yield bromide ion.</dc:description>

         <title>Directing Group Assisted Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H sulfanylation of Alkenyl Carbonyl Compounds with Disulfides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, a highly efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed sulfanylation of alkenyl carbonyl compounds with readily available disulfides has been developed. The bidentate directing auxiliary has been demonstrated to promote the activity of copper catalyst under mild oxidizing conditions, prevents copper catalyst deactivation in the catalytic cycle, and ensures high regioselectivity of (Z)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;alkenyl sulfides in this transformation.







Abstract
A highly efficient and straightforward copper&#8208;catalyzed sulfanylation of acrylamides with readily available disulfides has been developed. Through 8&#8208;aminoquinoline&#8208;assisted activation of the alkenyl C&#8722;H bond, a broad scope of (Z)&#8208;alkenyl sulfides were constructed in moderate to excellent yields with good compatibility of functional groups. Moreover, the bidentate directing auxiliary promotes high regioselectivity of (Z)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;alkenyl sulfides, and enables the excellent performance of copper catalyst in this transformation.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Regioselective Chlorosulfenylation of Indoles by Dimethylsulfoxide and 1,2&#8208;Dichloroethane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and cost&#8208;effective metal&#8208;free method for vicinal Csp2&#8722;H difunctionalization of indole was reported. The common solvents dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dichloroethane (DCE) were used as precursor to generate chlorodimethylsulfonium ion for electrophilic methylthiolation followed by chlorination by enabling 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;methylthioindoles.







Abstract
Direct chloromethylthiolation of the C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds of indole was achieved with the commonly used solvents dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dichloroethane (DCE). Initially, chlorodimethylsulfonium ion is generated in&#8197;situ from the reaction of DMSO and DCE on simple heating at 120&#8201;&#176;C and is used for electrophilic methylthiolation followed by chlorination, enabling the synthesis of 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;methylthioindoles.

         <title>Difluoroethylation Reactions of Organic Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 7, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As an important class of fluorinated compounds, MeCF2&#8208;featured compounds have found growing benefits in agrochemical and pharmaceutical applications. The known synthesis strateges for difluoroethylation established in the past years are discussed in detail in this concept.







Abstract
Given the profound effect of fluorine&#8208;containing groups in improving the chemical, physical, and biological properties of the parent compound, the fluorine&#8208;containing groups were receiving increasing attention in the medicinal, pharmaceutical, agricultural, and material sciences. Unlike well&#8208;developed trifluoromethylation and difluoromethylation reactions, the efficient and mild methods for rapid introduction of CF2Me are still underdeveloped, despite their important applications in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. This concept describes recent progress in difluoroethylation functionalization.

         <title>Towards Responsive Spiroborate&#8208;Based Assemblies of Podand&#8208;Type Ligands Functionalized with Two Terminal/Peripheral Catecholate Moieties in the Presence of Alkali Cations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 7, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible bis&#8208;catecholate podand&#8208;type ligands of various lengths were synthesized. Upon reaction with boric acid and a hydroxide alkaline solution, a spiroborate node forms and the alkali cation is wrapped by the flexible spacer. Influence of the spacer's length and the alkali cation size on the formation of monomeric or oligomeric spiroborate compounds was studied in solution by DOSY&#8197;NMR.







Abstract
The synthesis of two ligands bearing two terminal catecholate binding sites connected by an oligo(ethyleneglycol) bridge of two distinct lengths and their self&#8208;assembly upon boron coordination and alkali cation binding (M=Li, Na, K, Cs) are reported. Attempts to synthesize positional isomers of the ligands are also described. Binding of the four alkali cations M+ through M&#8722;O interactions was studied depending on the length of the oligo(ethyleneglycol) chain in solution by 1H and DOSY&#8197;NMR, mass spectrometry (MS) and in the solid&#8208;state by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) on single crystals. MS spectrometry as well as 1H&#8197;NMR revealed the presence of monomeric and oligomeric spiroborate compounds. Two monomeric macrocycles could be characterized by XRD, entrapping either lithium or cesium cations within the spiroborate macrocycle.

         <title>Deacetylation of Mannosylerythritol Lipids in Hydrophobic Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 7, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic deacetylation of mannosylerythritol lipid (MEL) biosurfactant mixtures in naturally derived deep eutectic solvents has comparable yields and kinetics to conventional organic solvents. Here, the example of thymol&#8208;coumarin 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture is shown where the diacetylated (MEL&#8722;A) and monoacetylated (MEL&#8722;B and MEL&#8722;C) are converted to fully deacetylated compound (MEL&#8722;D) with 50&#8201;% yield after 140&#8197;hours.







Abstract
Mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs) are a promising group of biosurfactants due to their high fermentation yield, selfassembly and biological activity. During fermentation by Pseudozyma aphidis, a mixture of MELs with different levels of acylation is formed, of which the fully deacetylated form is the most valuable. In order to reduce the environmental impact of deacetylation, an enzymatic process using natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) has been developed. We tested the deacetylation of a purified MELs mixture with immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B enzyme and 2&#8208;ethylhexanol as co&#8208;substrate in 140&#8197;h reactions with different NADES. We identified hydrophobic NADES systems with similar yields and kinetics as in pure 2&#8208;ethylhexanol solvent. Our results indicate that deacetylation of MELs mixtures in NADES as a solvent is possible with yields comparable to pure co&#8208;substrate and that hydrophobic NADES without carboxylic acid compounds facilitate the reaction to the greatest extent.

&lt;p&gt;Enzymatic deacetylation of mannosylerythritol lipid (MEL) biosurfactant mixtures in naturally derived deep eutectic solvents has comparable yields and kinetics to conventional organic solvents. Here, the example of thymol-coumarin 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture is shown where the diacetylated (MEL&#8722;A) and monoacetylated (MEL&#8722;B and MEL&#8722;C) are converted to fully deacetylated compound (MEL&#8722;D) with 50&#8201;% yield after 140&#8197;hours.

         <title>On the Keto&#8208;Enol&#8208;Tautomerism of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;Hydroxyethylidene)malononitrile and Its Lewis Adduct Formation with B(C6F5)3</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 7, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using NMR techniques and SCXRD, it is proven that 2&#8208;(1&#8208;hydroxyethylidene)malononitrile exists exclusively as the enol isomer in solution as well as in the solid state. Additionally, the Lewis acid mono&#8208; and diadduct of the enol with B(C6F5)3 as Lewis acid are fully characterized. DFT as well as CC calculations underline the preference of the enol isomer in the tautomeric equilibrium.







Abstract
2&#8208;(1&#8208;Hydroxyethylidene)malononitrile (4) is commercially sold as the keto isomer and is described in the literature as either a keto (4&#8201;b) or enol (4&#8201;a) species. Using NMR techniques and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, we were able to show that 4 exists exclusively as the enol isomer (4&#8201;a) in solution as well as in the solid state, which agrees with quantum chemical calculations. By adding one or two equivalents of the Lewis acid B(C6F5)3, the mono&#8208; or diadducts are formed in exergonic reactions, in which the enol form is further thermodynamically stabilized. The structure and acidity of enol 4&#8201;a and its borane adducts are discussed based on experimental and theoretical results.

         <title>The influence of acceptor acidity on hydrogen bond mediated aglycone delivery (HAD) through the picoloyl protecting group</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 7, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen bond strength matters! The stereoselectivity of glycosylation reactions employing hydrogen bond&#8208;mediated aglycone delivery (HAD), through the picoloyl protecting group, is dependent on the acidity of the acceptor. More acidic acceptors form stronger hydrogen bonds with the donor leading to more control of stereoselectivity.







Abstract
The outcome of glycosylation reactions heavily relies on the specific protecting group patterns employed on both the donor and acceptor molecules. The picoloyl (Pico) protecting group stands out as it can steer the stereoselectivity in a glycosylation reaction through hydrogen bond&#8208;mediated aglycone delivery (HAD). This provides syn&#8208;stereoselectivity, with respect to the stereochemistry of the Pico group, by forming a hydrogen bond between the incoming acceptor and the picoloyl ring nitrogen. We here probe how acceptor acidity influences the stereodirecting effect of the picoloyl protecting group. A set of 3&#8208;O&#8208;functionalized glucosyl and mannosyl donors, each bearing different protecting groups (picolinate, nicotinate, isonicotinate, and benzoate), were synthesized for systematic evaluation. For the 3&#8208;O&#8208;picoloyl&#8208;glucose series, the picoloyl group exhibited minimal influence on stereoselectivity, with only weak nucleophiles showing a modest shift in selectivity for the 3&#8208;O&#8208;Pico protected glucosyl donor in comparison to the other C&#8208;3&#8208;acyl glucosides. In contrast, in the 3&#8208;O&#8208;picoloyl&#8208;mannose series a much stronger &#946;&#8208;directing effect was observed, wherein more acidic acceptors led to increased &#946;&#8208;selectivity. The results provide insights into the complex interplay of acceptor acidity and glycosylation stereoselectivity mediated by the picoloyl protecting group.

         <dc:description>
The B(OH)3&#8208;catalyzed dual Friedel&#8208;Crafts type reaction has been developed to install a tertiary Csp3&#8208;center. The efficacy of this process is explored towards the preparation of symmetric and unsymmetric tri&#8208;arylmethanes (TRAMs).







Abstract
The catalytic influences of boric acid have been introduced on dual Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction between arylamines and aldehydes to install the Csp3&#8208;center that leads to the formation of di&#8208; or tri&#8208;substituted methanes. The described reaction conditions have directed the transformation to favor the para&#8208;para substitution pattern to deliver the major products rather than the corresponding ortho&#8208;para functionalization process. The devised transformation was examined by DFT calculation, which shows the favorable activation energy of transition states (TS) for the generation of highly substituted molecular scaffolds. The method was applicable over diversely substituted aldehydes and arylamines to afford the final products in excellent yields (60&#8208;92&#8201;%) and selectivity. The proposed mechanism is supported by suitable control experiments, GC&#8208;MS studies, and DFT calculations.

         <title>Successive &#946;&#8208;Glycosylations of Tiacumicinone: Formal Total Synthesis of Tiacumicin B and Access to a d&#8208;Mannoside Analog</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 7, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formal total synthesis of the antibiotic tiacumicin B is described as well as an analog with a d&#8208;mannose moiety in place of d&#8208;rhamnose. The challenging &#946;&#8208;selectivity of the key glycosylation steps has been achieved by using donors bearing a phenyl sulfoxide leaving group and a 3&#8208;O&#8208;picoloyl group that enables remote facial diastereocontrol via H&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated aglycone delivery.







Abstract
A formal total synthesis of the natural macrolide antibiotic tiacumicin B is described featuring successive and selective glycosylations of tiacumicinone. The challenging &#946;&#8208;facial selectivity of these key glycosylation steps was achieved by using noviosyl or rhamnosyl donors equipped with a phenyl sulfoxide leaving group and a 3&#8208;O&#8208;picoloyl group ensuring an efficient remote stereodirecting effect. Compared with our former total synthesis, this strategy enables us to save steps and gain access to new analogs. This was demonstrated by the replacement of the rhamnosidic moiety by a d&#8208;mannose derivative.

         <title>Study of the Mechanism of 7&#8208;exo&#8208;trig Cyclizations of Aryl, Vinyl, and Alkyl Radicals on Oxime Ethers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 7, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our research combines experimental techniques and DFT calculations to investigate the mechanism of 7&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization of aryl, vinyl, and alkyl radicals on oxime ethers. These cyclization processes are exothermic and irreversible, showing a preference for nucleophilic alkyl radicals. The high cyclization rate constants (103&#8211;108&#8197;s&#8722;1) highlight the synthetic potential of these reactions for constructing seven&#8208;membered carbocyclic and heterocyclic systems.







Abstract
In this work, we conducted a study of 7&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclizations mechanism involving aryl, vinyl, and alkyl radicals on oxime ethers. Initially, the reaction of brominated oxime ether 9&#8201;a with (TMS)3SiH and AIBN gave rise to aryl radicals that underwent a 7&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization on the oxime ether, yielding dibenzoxepine 10&#8201;a, and the ipso reaction and reduction products were obtained as well. Approximate rate constants at 80&#8201;&#176;C for the 7&#8208;exo&#8208;trig (1.0&#215;108&#8197;s&#8722;1) and the ipso cyclization (4.3&#215;107&#8197;s&#8722;1) were determined by competition experiments. DFT calculations showed good agreement with the experimental results. The reduction rate constant of the N&#8208;alkoxyaminyl radical with (TMS)3SiH was calculated to be 4.1&#215;10&#8722;1&#8197;M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1; while the rate constants for the 7&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclizations of vinyl and alkyl radicals on the oxime ether were estimated in the ranges of 106&#8197;s&#8722;1&#8211;108&#8197;s&#8722;1 and 103&#8197;s&#8722;1&#8211;108&#8197;s&#8722;1, respectively. The 7&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization reactions involving aryl, vinyl, and alkyl radicals with oxime ethers were found to be an exothermic and irreversible process, with the oximic carbon showing a preference for nucleophilic alkyl radicals. This kinetic study contributes to the deeper understanding of radical&#8208;mediated cyclizations, enabling the efficient design of complex synthetic routes.

A photoredox&#8208;neutral 1,2,5&#8208;trifunctionalization of &#945;&#8208;hydroxyhexenoates is disclosed. The reaction proceeds through a sequence of radical addition, intramolecular heteroaryl migration, and radical&#8208;polar crossover deuteration, leading to functionalized &#945;&#8208;deuterated lactic acid derivatives. The reaction features mild photochemical conditions and provides an efficient approach for the synthesis of valuable deuterated molecules.

         <title>An In&#8208;Situ&#8208;Formed Copper&#8208;Based Perfluorinated Catalytic System for the Aerobic Oxidation of Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 7, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new, in&#8197;situ generated, fluorous biphasic catalytic protocol for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols was developed. The (pre)catalytic species utilized are stable, widely available and easily synthesized: Cu2O as the copper source, perfluorinated NHC salt precursors, TEMPO, and O2 as the oxidant. The perfluorinated catalytic system solution can be recovered and reused successfully, up to six times.







Abstract
Herein, we report a new catalytic protocol for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols. The catalytic system is formed in&#8197;situ, in a straightforward and user&#8208;friendly manner, combining a widely available copper source (Cu2O) with one imidazolium salt precursor bearing perfluorinated moieties. Our protocol uses TEMPO, as additive, and the reaction takes place at the interface of a biphasic solvent system, consisting of anisole and 1&#8208;bromoperfluorooctane. The as&#8208;prepared carbonyl compounds remain in the organic solvent, while the catalytic system remains in the fluorous phase. In this manner, the isolation and purification of the desired products are quite facile. Our protocol uses low catalytic loadings and is more efficient with primary alcohols, affording the desired products in good to excellent yields. The fluorous phase containing the catalytic system can be efficiently recovered and reused for at least six times, without a significant decrease in its catalytic efficiency.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 7, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism and the pericyclicity of metal&#8208;promoted bicyclization reactions that purportedly involve 8&#8208;electron electrocyclization steps were examined computationally, with results showing that these reactions do indeed proceed via 8&#8208;electron electrocyclizations rather than alternative pathways involving 4&#8208;electron electrocyclizations followed by Cope rearrangements.







Abstract
Density functional theory was used to elucidate the mechanism and the pericyclicity of chromium&#8208;catalyzed bicyclization reactions that purportedly involve 8&#8208;electron electrocyclization steps. Our computational results indicate that these reactions do indeed proceed via 8&#8208;electron electrocyclization rather than an alternative pathway involving 4&#8208;electron electrocyclization followed by Cope rearrangement. The role of C=[M] groups on the electrocyclization, specifically its pericyclicity, was examined in detail using modern theoretical tools.

         <title>Substituent Effects on the Electronic Ground State (Singlet versus Triplet) of Indenyl Cations: DFT and CASPT2 Studies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 7, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic ground states of cations (singlet versus triplet) attract significant attention in the discovery of novel carbocation chemistry. In this study, a strategy that controls the ground state of indenyl cations is established using density functional theory and complete active space multiconfiguration second order perturbation theory; electron&#8208;donating groups at C2 position stabilize the triplet state in energy.







Abstract
The electronic ground states of cations (singlet versus triplet) attract significant attention in the discovery of novel carbocation chemistry. Although the cyclopentadienyl cation exhibits a triplet ground state because of the antiaromaticity of the closed&#8208;shell singlet state, the ground state of the indenyl cation, which is a benzene&#8208;fused derivative of the cyclopentadienyl cation, is reportedly a closed&#8208;shell singlet state rather than a triplet state. In this study, in order to establish a strategy for controlling the ground state of indenyl cations, the substituent effects at the C2 and C5 positions of their structures were computed using density functional theory and complete active space multiconfiguration second order perturbation levels of theory.

         <dc:description>
The factors affecting the palladium&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;chloromethylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone were investigated. The combined effect of ligand, additive and N&#8208;Chlorophthalimide (NCP) is an important factor for the yield and ee value of this reaction. The method has good generalizability.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone is an important skeleton in many natural products and pharmaceuticals. The factors influencing the palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;chloromethylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones were investigated, including ligands, additives, the chlorine source, temperature, and solvents. We found that the reaction had broad substrate scope for the synthesis of the corresponding chiral products when the ligand, chlorine source and additives were optimized. The results will improve the catalytic synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;chloromethylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones.

         <title>Total Synthesis of a Pancratistatin/Shikimic Acid Hybrid Analogue</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 7, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise synthesis of the pancratistatin framework, via a Heck reaction and subsequent cyclisation, is reported. The unfunctionalised model core of pancratistatin was synthesised from 1&#8208;cyclohexene&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acid in two steps in 50&#8201;% yield. A modified route was then successfully applied to (&#8722;)&#8208;shikimic acid to afford a novel pancratistatin/shikimic acid hybrid analogue that possesses three stereo&#8208;defined hydroxyl groups in the C&#8208;ring.







Abstract
Pancratistatin and structurally related narciclasine are natural products of great interest as they display potent and selective activities against various diseases. A concise synthesis of a functionalised pancratistatin framework, via a Heck reaction and subsequent cyclisation, is reported. The unfunctionalised model core of pancratistatin was synthesised from 1&#8208;cyclohexene&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acid in two steps in 50&#8201;% yield. A modified route was then successfully applied to (&#8722;)&#8208;shikimic acid to afford a novel pancratistatin/shikimic acid hybrid analogue that possesses three stereo&#8208;defined hydroxyl groups in the C&#8208;ring.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 7, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides are species derived from the addition of a carboxylic acid to an isocyanate, and are well&#8208;known to form amides products with release of CO2. Although first reported over 120&#8197;years ago, their potential use as reagents for amide bond&#8208;forming reactions is currently underexplored. In this article, the properties, synthesis and current applications of NCAs are highlighted.







Abstract
N&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides (NCAs) are compounds derived from the addition of a carboxylic acid to an isocyanate, and are known to form amides readily with the release of CO2 as a by&#8208;product. NCAs have been known for over 120&#8197;years, but despite their lengthy history, have remained so far overshadowed by more traditional approaches to amide bond formation. In this review, the potential utility of NCAs in the context of amide bond formation is reviewed and their preparation, reactivity and practical application are also discussed.

         <title>Synthesis of Cryptophanes: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 7, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review details current advancements in synthesizing cryptophane host molecules post the 2009 comprehensive review by Brotin and Dutasta. It categorizes literature based on methods for creating the cryptophane core and evolving late&#8208;stage functionalization techniques. Focus is placed on template synthesis, coupling, late&#8208;stage functionalization, small&#8208;molecule binding, and some applications.







Abstract
This review covers the latest developments in the synthesis of cryptophane host molecules since the publication of the last extensive review by Brotin and Dutasta in 2009. The literature has been categorized according to the synthetic method for generating the cryptophane core and we also emphasize emerging late&#8208;stage functionalization approaches. The synthetic strategies towards cryptophanes can be broadly categorized into the well&#8208;established direct&#8208; (two&#8208;step), template&#8208; and coupling (or capping) methods. The examples covered in this review mainly highlight template&#8208;based synthesis, coupling approaches and late&#8208;stage functionalization.

         <title>The Multifaceted Chemistry of [2.2]Paracyclophane&#8208;Based Thioethers with Palladium(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work explores the reactivity of [2.2]paracyclophanes displaying a CH2SR group on one aromatic ring with various PdL2 salts. In most cases (R=Ph, 2&#8208;pyridyl, Me, n&#8208;dodecyl), an unexpected cleavage of the carbon&#8208;sulfur, along with incorporation of one L ligand (L=TFA, OAc, OPiv, Cl, Br), occurred. In contrast, the t&#8208;butylsulfanyl derivative (R=t&#8208;Bu) underwent a regioselective ortho C&#8722;H bond activation to furnish a SC&#8208;palladacycle as a single diastereoisomer.







Abstract
The reactions of planar chiral ([2.2]paracyclophan&#8208;4&#8208;yl)methyl thioethers ([2.2]PCP&#8208;CH2&#8208;SR) with various palladium(II) sources (PdL2) were studied. Unexpectedly, with most of the sulfur substrates investigated (SR=Ph, 2&#8208;pyridyl, Me, n&#8208;dodecyl), and independently of the PdL2 salt employed (L=TFA, OAc, OPiv, Cl, Br), loss of the SR sulfanyl unit, along with incorporation of one palladium L ligand to the lateral benzylic position of the [2.2]PCP core, has been observed. In contrast, the precursor featuring a t&#8208;butylsulfanyl group (R=t&#8208;Bu) exhibited a distinct reactivity. An ortho C(sp2)&#8722;H activation took place, and allowed the formation of a [2.2]paracyclophane&#8208;based SC&#8208;palladacycle, in an efficient and highly diastereoselective manner (83&#8201;% yield, single diastereoisomer).

         <title>A Novel Synthesis of Soluble, Stable Derivatives of the Perchlorinated Trityl Radical</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chlorination of the fluorinated triarylmethane is followed by selective nucleophilic substitution using the sodium salt of n&#8208;hexanol in n&#8208;hexanol/dimethylsulfoxide and conversion to the radical.







Abstract
A new approach to the synthesis of derivatives of the perchlorinated tritryl radical is described. It relies on the fact that, under the conditions required to fully chlorinate the ortho positions of a triarylmethane, there is only minimal substitution of aryl fluorine by chlorine and then on the fact that, in the mixed Cl/F substituted triarylmethanes obtained, it is possible to selectively substitute the fluorine&#8208;bearing positions using the sodium salt of n&#8208;hexanol in n&#8208;hexanol/dimethylsulfoxide. The meta&#8208;hexyloxy derivatives obtained are much more soluble and photostable than the parent perchlorotrityl radical. For example, the introduction of four meta&#8208;hexyloxy substituents gives a radical where, under white light illumination, the lifetime is improved by a factor of almost 104. The photostability of the radical, the lifetime of the excited state and the fluorescence all decrease as the number of meta&#8208;hexyloxy substituents is increased. The improvements in solubility and in photostability observed should help in creating a more diverse range of perchlorotrityl radical derivatives and in the development of new applications.

         <title>Base&#8208;Induced Annulation of Glycal&#8208;Derived &#945;&#8208;iodopyranone with 2&#8208;Aminopyrimidinones: Access to Chiral Imidazopyrimidinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild synthetic protocol was developed to synthesize novel imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidinone&#8208;based glycohybrids in good to excellent yields. The synthetic method involves a base&#8208;induced Michael&#8208;type addition reaction using various 2&#8208;aminopyridinones and sugar&#8208;derived iodopyranones, followed by intramolecular nucleophilic substitution.







Abstract
A simple, environmentally benign and catalyst&#8208;free method for the synthesis of chirally enriched imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidinone glycohybrids has been successfully developed. The protocol is based on a base&#8208;induced annulation of &#945;&#8208;iodo&#8208;pyranone with Michael addition of 2&#8208;aminopyrimidinones followed by intramolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction. The privilege of this method includes mild reaction conditions, eco&#8208;friendly solvent and a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free approach. Moreover, using straightforward simple methods, this reaction method exhibits a broad range of substrate scope and remarkable tolerance toward various functional groups.

         <title>Ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H Methylation and Ipso&#8208;C&#8722;O Alkenylation of Aryl Triflates via Catellani Strategy</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H methylation and ipso&#8208;C&#8722;O alkenylation were achieved through co&#8208;catalysis with palladium and norbornene (NBE). This strategy represents a novel approach for the conversion of phenol derivatives into polysubstituted methylated aromatics. This reaction strategy has a wide range of substrates and high functional group tolerance. The use of aryl sulfonates instead of aryl halides expands the range of substrates for Catellani&#8208;type reactions and provides a new idea for efficient and benign methylation.







Abstract
The ortho C&#8722;H methylation and ipso C&#8722;O alkenylation of aryl triflates was regio&#8208;selectively achieved in one pot by palladium/norbornene (NBE) synergistic catalysis. This work provides an efficient method for preparing poly&#8208;substituted aromatics with (deuterated) methyl and alkenyl groups from the readily available phenoxides.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The trifluoromethylsulfinylation reaction of activated arenes with trifluoromethanesulfinyl chloride (CF3SOCl) in the presence of Lewis acid was achieved under mild and solvent&#8208;free conditions. A series of aryl trifluoromethyl sulfoxides were obtained in moderate to high yields. The protocol could be expanded to the perfluoroalkylsulfinylation of activated arenes, as well as the trifluoromethylsulfinylation of indoles without additive.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Application of a New Class of Planar and Centrally Chiral Ferrocenyl Amino Alcohol Ligands</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A family of ferrocenyl amino alcohols (14 examples) has been prepared from the corresponding planar chiral ketones and evaluated as a new class of chiral ligands for asymmetric ethyl&#8208; and phenylzinc additions to aldehydes. The highly enantioselective synthesis of these ligands is facile, scalable, robust and relies on the use of cheaply available starting materials. Asymmetric ethyl additions proceeded smoothly at ambient temperature, with reaction times as short as 1 hour furnishing the desired products in up to 90% yield and 99% ee. The corresponding phenyl additions afforded products in up to 81% yield and 88% ee. The observed stereochemical outcome for the addition of diethylzinc was rationalized and the key proposed transition state was supported by an analysis of the X&#8208;ray structures of a series of amino alcohol ligands.</dc:description>

Key steps in the synthesis of the teraryls are azide formation with subsequent reduction and amidation, followed by Suzuki cross couplings. The ortho fusions were achieved with phosphorus pentoxide and phosphoryl oxide. The total syntheses could be accomplished with 10% and 3%, respectively, in seven consecutive steps starting with meta&#8208;dibromobenzene. The helicenes were investigated by UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and by quantum chemical calculation of, inter alia, the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps. Racemization barriers of the helicenes were calculated, whereupon the optical resolution of 5,9&#8208;diaza[6]helicene was attempted and carried out successfully; ECD spectra were measured of its enantiomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Preparation of Air Stable Organozinc Pivalates and their Applications in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article demonstrates the various recently discovered novel methods for the preparation of air&#8208;and moisture&#8208;stable organozinc pivalates as a solid remarkedly covering a wide range of aryl, heteroaryl, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl and benzyl scaffolds have been reported. The &#8722;OPiv salt&#8208;stabilized organozinc pivalates achieved via selective metalation (DoM), oxidative Zn insertion, and X/metal exchange reaction followed by successful trans&#8208;metalation approaches with Zn(OPiv)2, Thus, reactive organozinc reagents smoothly react with various electrophiles in the presence of transition metal catalysts (Pd, Co, Cu and Ni) under mild and sustainable conditions produced C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;S bond formation products.







Abstract
This review discusses various methods for the preparation of air and water&#8208;stable organozinc pivalates containing aryl, heteroaryl, alkyl, alkenyl, benzyl and alkynyl scaffolds achieved via i) selective metalation (DoM) in the presence of a directing group (DG) in the aromatic core, ii) direct oxidative Zn metal insertion/or X/M exchange reaction followed by transmetalation with Zn(Opiv)2, which are then further functionalized by Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reactions, or trapping with different aryl, heteroaryl, alkenyl, alkynyl electrophiles used by transition metal catalysts (Pd, Co, Ni, Cu). Selective deprotonation of aryl or heteroaryl derivatives can be performed using LDA, TMP&#8722;Mg and TMP&#8722;Zn reagents in the presence of a directing group on the aromatic system. Different organozinc reagents based on aromatic and non&#8208;aromatic structures with electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient substituents undergo transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2), C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp) and C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) types of cross&#8208;coupling reactions with aryl and heteroaryl halides and diaryl disulfides under mild conditions with the sustainable catalytic process. The literature report shows that the polyfunctionalized nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur&#8208;based bioactive pharmaceutical scaffolds, natural products and target organic molecules are accessible using highly air and moisture&#8208;stable organozinc pivalates under sustainable coupling reaction conditions. Importantly, the sensitive functional groups are tolerable, and the commercially available substrates and inexpensive low toxic reagents can be employed with organozinc pivalates. In this context, this review article provides a detailed summary of the numerous synthetic strategies and practical methods for the preparation of aryl, alkenyl, benzyl and alkynyl organozinc reagents that can be isolated in the pure solid form. Additionally, some recently published examples demonstrating their catalytic application in organic synthesis are discussed.

&lt;p&gt;This review article demonstrates the various recently discovered novel methods for the preparation of air-and moisture-stable organozinc pivalates as a solid remarkedly covering a wide range of aryl, heteroaryl, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl and benzyl scaffolds have been reported. The &#8722;OPiv salt-stabilized organozinc pivalates achieved via selective metalation (DoM), oxidative Zn insertion, and X/metal exchange reaction followed by successful trans-metalation approaches with Zn(OPiv)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Thus, reactive organozinc reagents smoothly react with various electrophiles in the presence of transition metal catalysts (Pd, Co, Cu and Ni) under mild and sustainable conditions produced C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;S bond formation products.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review discusses various methods for the preparation of air and water-stable organozinc pivalates containing aryl, heteroaryl, alkyl, alkenyl, benzyl and alkynyl scaffolds achieved via i) selective metalation (DoM) in the presence of a directing group (DG) in the aromatic core, ii) direct oxidative Zn metal insertion/or X/M exchange reaction followed by transmetalation with Zn(Opiv)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which are then further functionalized by Negishi cross-coupling reactions, or trapping with different aryl, heteroaryl, alkenyl, alkynyl electrophiles used by transition metal catalysts (Pd, Co, Ni, Cu). Selective deprotonation of aryl or heteroaryl derivatives can be performed using LDA, TMP&#8722;Mg and TMP&#8722;Zn reagents in the presence of a directing group on the aromatic system. Different organozinc reagents based on aromatic and non-aromatic structures with electron-rich and electron-deficient substituents undergo transition metal-catalyzed C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp) and C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) types of cross-coupling reactions with aryl and heteroaryl halides and diaryl disulfides under mild conditions with the sustainable catalytic process. The literature report shows that the polyfunctionalized nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur-based bioactive pharmaceutical scaffolds, natural products and target organic molecules are accessible using highly air and moisture-stable organozinc pivalates under sustainable coupling reaction conditions. Importantly, the sensitive functional groups are tolerable, and the commercially available substrates and inexpensive low toxic reagents can be employed with organozinc pivalates. In this context, this review article provides a detailed summary of the numerous synthetic strategies and practical methods for the preparation of aryl, alkenyl, benzyl and alkynyl organozinc reagents that can be isolated in the pure solid form. Additionally, some recently published examples demonstrating their catalytic application in organic synthesis are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Comparative Kinetic and Computational Investigation of the Carbon&#8208;Sulfur Cross Coupling of Potassium Thioacetate and 2&#8208;Bromo Thiophene Using Palladium/Bisphosphine Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbon&#8208;sulfur cross&#8208;coupling reaction involving a 2&#8208;bromothiophene derivative and potassium thioacetate as a hydrogen sulfide surrogate was investigated. Two 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bisphosphino&#8208;ferrocene ligands were compared in kinetic experiments and by computational methods to rationalize the different reactivity profiles.







Abstract
We conducted an investigation into the palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbon&#8208;sulfur cross&#8208;coupling reaction involving a 2&#8208;bromothiophene derivative and potassium thioacetate as a substitute for hydrogen sulfide. This investigation utilized kinetic and computational methods. We synthesized two palladium complexes supported by the bisphosphane ligands bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (DPPF) and bis(diisopropylphosphino)ferrocene (DiPPF), as well as their tentative intermediates in the catalytic cycle. Reaction rates were measured and then compared to computational predictions.

         <title>Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Imino Amidines and 2,3&#8208;Diamino Indolenines Using a One&#8208;Pot Graphene Oxide&#8208;Catalyzed Process</title>

         <dc:description>
A facile and efficient method for the preparation of &#945;&#8208;imino amidines and 2,3&#8208;diamino indolenines through a graphene oxide&#8208;promoted 3&#8197;C Ugi reaction followed by a C&#8722;N bond oxidation and an eventual cyclization has been reported.







Abstract
The acid&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component (3&#8197;C) UGI reaction of isocyanides, amines, and aldehydes generally gives &#945;&#8208;amino amidines. Herein, we report the graphene oxide (GO)&#8208;promoted promoted 3&#8197;C Ugi reaction followed by a C&#8722;N bond oxidation to provide rapid access to &#945;&#8208;imino amidines. GO plays a crucial role both in the multicomponent reaction and in the subsequent oxidation. Interestingly, &#945;&#8208;imino amidines bearing electron&#8208;donating groups undergo spontaneous cyclization leading substituted 2,3&#8208;diamino indolenines. The scope of the process has been investigated with respect to all three components, and a comparison between the one&#8208;pot and sequential approaches is given. The major advantages of the developed methodology include one&#8208;pot synthesis, operational simplicity, high atom economy, broad substrate scope, multicomponent character, and applicability towards gram scale synthesis. Recovery and regeneration of GO and investigation of its real active sites has been performed by control experiments and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine(III)&#8208;Catalysis Using Sulfoxide Oxidant for the Dehydrogenative Cycloisomerization&#8208;Arylation Reaction of 2&#8208;Propargyl 1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds</title>

         <dc:description>
Hypervalent iodine(III) catalysis using an activated sulfoxide as a terminal oxidant has been developed for the metal&#8208;free synthesis of arylated furans. o&#8208;Nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride (o&#8208;NsCl) or the generated acid activates the sulfoxide. 1&#8208;(Chloromethyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan&#8208;1&#8208;ium 4&#8208;methylbenzenesulfonate (TEDA&#8208;OTs) contributes to the stability of the activated sulfoxide.







Abstract
We report herein an unprecedented hypervalent iodine(III)&#8208;catalysis using the activated sulfoxide. Since the present catalytic systems promote the dehydrogenative cycloisomerization&#8208;arylation reaction of 2&#8208;propargyl 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds with aromatics, this report also provides one of the few methods for iodine(III)&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation of aromatics.

         <dc:description>A Pd&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component intermolecular reaction between aryl halides, ClCF2COONa and phenols is developed. A series of aryl benzoates were synthesized in up to 84% yield via difluorocarbene transfer carbonylation. It is devoted to acquiring the targeted products by construction of new C&#8208;C, C=O and C&#8208;O bonds in a one&#8208;pot, one&#8208;step process. The feature of this method includes the use of readily available starting materials, showing outstanding resistance to spatial obstruction and simple operation procedure with mild reaction conditions. Therefore, this makes the methodology a useful alternative to other schemes typically used for the synthesis of aryl esters.</dc:description>

This review mainly focuses on transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydrogenation, which is categorized by functional groups.







Abstract
&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated compounds are one of the most important functional compounds. Due to their unique property and versatile utility, they usually occur as the key intermediates for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and biological materials. Thus, their synthesis has attracted more attentions than before. The early approaches to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated compounds are mainly about transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free methods, such as halogenation&#8208;dehydrohalogenation methods and strong oxidants methods (organosulfur, organoselenium, benzoquinone). Subsequently, palladium and the other transition&#8208;metals catalyzed dehydrogenation of carbonyl compounds appeared respectively. In this review, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydrogenation is discussed, which is categorized by functional groups.

         <title>A Green Approach to Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitutions of Nicotinic Esters in Cyrene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green choice: Cyrene has been used as an eco&#8208;friendly alternative to environmentally harmful polar aprotic solvents in SNAr reactions. This innovative protocol enabled the facile synthesis of a wide library of novel nicotinic esters, valuable precursors of bioactive compounds. This methodology could also be extended to scale&#8208;up processes, microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis, and one&#8208;pot telescoping reactions, thus enhancing its applicability in various eco&#8208;friendly synthetic contexts.







Abstract
The green solvent CyreneTM has emerged as a valuable substitute for conventional polar aprotic organic solvents such as DMF, DMSO and NMP (renowned for their toxicity and environmental concerns). However, in the presence of bases, Cyrene is prone to polymerization, thus potentially incompatible with reactions where a base is needed to generate reactive nucleophiles. In this study, we developed an efficient synthetic strategy for nucleophilic aromatic substitutions of nicotinic esters in Cyrene. The success of this protocol relies on a very short reaction time (only 15 minutes) which prevents polymerization from occurring. Indeed, Cyrene not only outperformed typical solvents such as DMF and DMSO, but also, being highly soluble in water, allowed an easy purification of the desired products by simple precipitation upon the addition of ice&#8208;water.

         <title>Reactivity of Biomass&#8208;Derived Olefins with Elemental Sulfur: Mechanistic Insight</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lignocellulosic biomass remains underutilized despite its annual production in gigaton quantities. Sulfur is another vastly underutilized waste product of fossil fuel refining. New mechanistic insight into the reactions of sulfur unveiled since 2020 suggest a rich and hitherto unexplored chemistry between biomass&#8208;derived olefins and elemental sulfur. In this study, four biomass&#8208;derived olefins (eugenol (1), 4&#8208;allyl&#8208;2,6&#8208;dimethoxy phenol (2), o&#8208;eugenol (3), and 2&#8208;allyl&#8208;6&#8208;methylphenol (4)) were reacted with elemental sulfur to elucidate the S&#8211;C bond&#8208;forming and other reactivity of these compounds. Each of the compounds was reacted with elemental sulfur in three sulfur : organic reactant ratios&#160; (2:1, 4:1 and 9:1) and at two temperatures (180 &#176;C or 230 &#176;C). Product mixtures were characterized using 1H NMR spectrometry and GC&#8208;MS analysis. Products resulting from a range of mechanisms were unveiled, including inverse vulcanization, S&#8211;Callylic/benzylic bond formation, S&#8211;Caryl bond formation, intramolecular cyclization, C&#8211;C s&#8208;bond scission, and C&#8211;O s&#8208;bond scission. It is anticipated that the insights from this study will support further synergy between the critical sustainability goals of biomass and sulfur utilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Preparative Application of Amine Transaminase&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions with Integrated Crystallization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transaminases are valuable catalysts in the synthesis of chiral amines. However, secondary techniques are typically required to shift the reaction equilibrium to the product side. This study focuses on the in situ&#8208;product crystallization, specifically at preparative synthetic scale as a non&#8208;synthetic tool for a selection of aromatic and aliphatic substrates using the transaminase from Silicibacter pomeroyi. Herein the technique is implemented in a simplified manner to facilitate in situ&#8208;product removal and downstream&#8208;processing in a combined crystallization step. After a series of optimizations, product concentrations of &gt;0.9 mol/L and &gt;99% e.e.(S) were obtained implementing a repetitive batch reaction approach using a universal carboxylate as anion.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This report describes the one&#8208;pot direct N&#8208;acylation of indazole with carboxylic acids using our previously developed 4&#8208;(N,N&#8208;dimethylamino)pyridine N&#8208;oxide (DMAPO)/di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl dicarbonate (Boc2O) system. This simple system provides N1&#8208;acyl indazoles in high yield with high N1 selectivities and does not require the use of activated derivatives of carboxylic acids or high temperatures. This new method exhibits a wide substrate scope (&gt;40 examples). In addition, a new synthesis of N1&#8208;functionalized alkyl indazoles utilizing N1&#8208;acyl indazoles as starting materials was achieved. This stepwise protocol is useful for the selective synthesis of structurally diverse N1&#8208;functionalized alkyl indazoles, which are difficult to synthesize by other methods such as the Mitsunobu reaction and classical SN2 alkylation of indazole.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More recent studies referring to the synthesis of 2H&#8208;arizines and their [3+n] ring&#8208;expansion, nucleophilic addition of C=N double bond, continuous nucleophilic addition/cyclization, ring&#8208;opening reactions to acyclic compounds and site&#8208;selective functionalization are reviewed. The review mainly covers the period from 2019 to 2023.







Abstract
2H&#8208;arizines are important three&#8208;membered heterocycles in organic chemistry. Recently, many advances in the synthesis and functionalization of 2H&#8208;arizines have been reported. Neber rearrangement, isomerization of isoxazole, oxidation of enamine, C&#8722;H bond activation, decomposition of vinyl azide, functionalization of alkyne, and multi&#8208;step synthesis have been developed for the efficient assembly of 2H&#8208;azirines. As versatile and highly strained three&#8208;membered unsaturated heterocycles, 2H&#8208;azirines can be used as distinctive building blocks towards significant functional groups, and have attracted extensive attention for the fabrication of numerous heterocycles. Recent studies have focused on [3+n] ring&#8208;expansion reactions, nucleophilic addition of C=N double bond or continuous nucleophilic addition followed by cyclization, ring&#8208;opening of 2H&#8208;azirines to acyclic compounds, and substitution of sp3&#8208;C&#8722;H of 2H&#8208;azirines. One of the most critical challenges is seeking for a selective opening of the specific three bonds of the strained azirine circle, some of what can be achieved on the basis of metal catalyst, photocatalysis, or combination of metal catalyst and photocatalysis. In this review, recent advances involving the synthesis and reactivity of 2H&#8208;arizines accompanied with challenges and breakthroughs are summarized. The review mainly covers the period from 2019 to 2023.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation and Deuteration Reactions of Bicyclic Alkenes in an Aqueous Environment</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation and deuteration of bicyclic alkenes, utilizing H2O and D2O as hydrogen sources with Zn0 or Mn0 reductants. Lewis&#8208;acid co&#8208;catalysts facilitated reactions and promoted transesterification. Introduction of 1&#8197;atm of H2 allowed catalytic metal reductant loading. These processes displayed excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance, consistently yielding high&#8208;product yields.







Abstract
Herein, we report cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation and deuteration reactions of bicyclic alkenes using H2O and D2O as the sole hydrogen and deuterium sources, respectively, employing Zn or Mn as a metal reductant. Lewis&#8208;acid co&#8208;catalysts were found to promote the reaction whilst simultaneously catalyzing transesterification processes. Use of 1&#8197;atm of H2 allows for catalytic loading of the metal reductant. In all cases, the reaction operated with high functional&#8208;group tolerance and produced reduced products in high yield.

         <title>Formylation of Propargylic Alcohols with Difluorocarbene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed an efficient method for the formylation reaction of propargylic alcohols and sodium chlorodifluoroacetate under mild conditions. It is the first example of the use of difluorocarbene as a carbonyl source and the reaction of propargylic alcohols to form formates.







Abstract
A method for the synthesis of propargylic formates from propargylic alcohols and sodium chlorodifluoroacetate is reported. In the reaction, sodium chlorodifluoroacetate is used as a difluorocarbene precursor and a formylating reagent to provide a carbonyl source, while the triple bond of propargylic alcohols is not involved. The method shows convenient operation, good functional group tolerance and high site&#8208;selectivity under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Multivalent Aminoseptanose Mimetics by Copper&#8208;Catalyzed (3+2) Cycloadditions of Azidomethyl&#8208;Substituted Bicyclic 1,2&#8208;Oxazines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiopure azidomethyl&#8208;substituted bicyclic 1,2&#8208;oxazine derivatives and alkynes reacted under copper catalysis to give (multivalent) (3+2) cycloadducts. The reductive removal of the N&#8208;benzyl group and cleavage of the N&#8722;O bond furnished aminooxepane derivatives, which can be regarded as septanose mimetics.







Abstract
Starting from readily available enantiopure azidomethyl&#8208;substituted bicyclic 1,2&#8208;oxazine derivatives and mono&#8208;, di&#8208; or trialkynes, their copper&#8208;catalyzed (3+2) cycloadditions furnished a series of 1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;linked compounds in good yields. These click reactions proceeded smoothly at room temperature when copper iodide as catalyst was used in the presence of triethylamine and tris[(1&#8208;gbenzyl&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)methyl]amine as ligand. Generally, the unprotected bicyclic 1,2&#8208;oxazine derivatives seemed to show slightly higher reactivity and provided better yields compared with their silyl&#8208;protected counterparts. Exhaustive hydrogenolysis with cleavage of the 1,2&#8208;oxazine N&#8722;O bonds in the presence of palladium on charcoal as promotor is feasible but was found to be capricious. Reasonable results were obtained when acetic acid was employed as cosolvent. By applying these conditions, several of the bicyclic 1,2&#8208;oxazine derivatives were successfully converted into the expected mono&#8208; or divalent aminooxepine derivatives which can be regarded as aminoseptanose mimetics.

         <title>Library Synthesis of Cyclobutanol Derivatives by Hyperbaric [2+2] Cycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclobutanes are attracting a growing interest in medicinal chemistry because of their unique structure and potentially advantageous pharmacological properties. Specifically, 1,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutanes have been explored as conformationally restricted propyl isosteres in drug development. In this study, a concise two&#8208;diversification&#8208;point library of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;[(arenesulfonyl)methyl]cyclobutanols was synthesized through a hyperbaric [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between sulfonyl allenes and benzyl vinyl ether as the key step. Three different sulfonyl allenes were used for synthesizing the core structures that were further derivatized by the addition of up to seven amines. The amino groups were incorporated in moderate to excellent diastereoselectivity through conjugate addition to the four&#8208;membered&#8208;ring scaffolds. Overall, this synthesis process demonstrates the potential for further chemical expansion and fragment growth in drug development.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Metallylenes for Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrogenation of alkenes, alkynes, carbonyls, and imines by H2&#8208;activated metallylenes (H3C&#8211;EH2&#8211;L,&#160;CELH2;&#160;E&#160;= Si, Ge, Sn and&#160;L&#160;= NMe2, PMe2) was studied using relativistic density functional theory at&#160;ZORA&#8208;BP86/TZ2P. By means of activation strain and Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital analyses, the physical factors underlying the trends in reactivity were identified and quantified. Firstly, the hydrogenation reactivity increases on descending Group 14, that is from silylenes (E&#160;= Si) to stannylenes (E&#160;= Sn). This reactivity trend originates primarily from a reduced energy to break the bonds between the Group 14 atom and the hydrogen atoms because the strength of these bonds decreases from Si&#8211;H to Ge&#8211;H to Sn&#8211;H. Secondly, the reactivity decreases as the Group 15 ligand changes from nitrogen to phosphorus (L&#160;= NMe2, PMe2) which stems from the trigonal pyramidal PMe2&#160;geometry compared to the trigonal planar structure NMe2&#160;geometry. The latter can, therefore, effectively engage in stronger orbital interactions with the substrate than the former, due to a more efficient HOMO&#8211;LUMO orbital overlap. By combining our insights, we rationally designed an optimally tuned catalyst (Group 14 atom and ligand) considering the overall catalytic cycle involving H2&#160;activation of the metallylene and subsequent hydrogenation.</dc:description>

By combining our insights, we rationally designed an optimally tuned catalyst (Group 14 atom and ligand) considering the overall catalytic cycle involving H2&#160;activation of the metallylene and subsequent hydrogenation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of new chiral ligands is essentially important in the field of asymmetric metal catalysis. Bispidines, steming from natural alkaloids, represent an intriguing yet underexplored class of chiral ligands. In this article, we developed a series of bispidine&#8208;based chiral ligands with chirality locked in the side chain, and explore their properties by applying in the palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric addition of arylboric acids to cyclic N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines. A S,N&#8208;bispidine ligand was found especially efficient, affording a series of chiral benzosultams with a quaternary chiral center in excellent yields with excellent ee values. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and crystal structure of catalyst helped to propose a reasonable mechanism including a possible transition state model to explain the origin of stereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The epoxidation of alkenes has altered and reshaped the way scientists think in modern organic synthesis. Herein, a novel, sustainable and eco&#8208;friendly protocol for the epoxidation of alkenes is reported, utilizing hydrogen peroxide as the green oxidant and, for the first time, hydroxamic acid derivatives as the organocatalyst. The presented methodology is very effective, leading to good to high yields for the oxidation of a variety of olefins, while various functional groups are well tolerated.

         <title>Access to Secondary Amines through Hydrogen Autotransfer Reaction Mediated by KOtBu</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potassium tert&#8208;butoxide was used for the direct synthesis of secondary amines through a hydrogen autotransfer reaction. Control experiments were carried out to identify the reaction intermediates and the role of the K+ ion in the reaction, and DFT calculations unveiled the reaction mechanism. The reaction has wide substrate scope with high functional&#8208;group tolerance.







Abstract
We report herein an N&#8208;alkylation reaction of amines with alcohols through a hydrogen autotransfer reaction. Unlike other catalytic systems containing transition metals or additives, potassium tertiary butoxide was found to be a unique and effective catalyst for synthesizing secondary amines. The role of the K+ ion and the reaction intermediates were studied under control experiments and by theoretical calculations. The reaction was found to be general and tolerates a series of functional groups, providing a convenient method to synthesize N&#8208;alkylated compounds.

         <title>Synthesis and Applications of Benzothienobenzofurans: A Review</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review analyses all the synthetic methodologies reported for the preparation of the four isomers of benzothienobenzofuran and examines the generality of each method by highlighting its advantages and disadvantages and delves on available mechanistic postulates.







Abstract
Heteroacenes are considered as an important class of compounds for material applications due to their stability, electron&#8208;richness and tunable properties. Mostly, four ring containing heteroacenes have found immense applications in organic electronic devices and some of them have been successfully commercialized. One such class of heteroacene are benzothienobenzofuran for which four different isomers are reported to date based on the position where the benzothiophene unit is fused to the benzofuran ring. The available literature claims different synthetic strategies towards the benzothienobenzofurans starting from multistep synthesis to tandem transformations, electrochemical synthesis and annulations. Different metal catalyzed transformations including Pd&#8208;catalyzed dual C&#8722;H activations, Ullmann coupling, dual metal&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot processes etc. are reported for the synthesis of different isomers of benzothienobenzofurans. The present review analyses all the synthetic methodologies reported for the preparation of the four isomers and examines the generality of each method by highlighting its advantages and disadvantages. We discuss all available mechanisms of the reactions for the benefit of the readers. Finally, the existing basic photophysical properties of benzothienobenzofurans and their limited applications in fabricating devices for organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED), organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET), and organic phototransistor (OPT) uses are deliberated

         <title>Chloride&#8208;Induced Selectfluor Activated Fluorothiolation of Alkenes to Access &#946;&#8208;Fluorothioether</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and efficient process for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;fluorothioethers via a three&#8208;component fluorothiolation of alkenes with thiophenols and selectfluor is reported. The reaction underwent a novel radical process, in which the chloride&#8208;activated Selectfluor was used to generate key active radical intermediates. This protocol was applicable to a wide range of functionalized alkenes and thiophenols, affording a series of &#946;&#8208;fluorothioethers in good yields.







Abstract
This study describes a chloride&#8208;induced three&#8208;component fluorothiolation of alkenes with arylthiophenols and selectfluor, facilitating efficient synthesis of &#946;&#8208;fluorothioether. The protocol exhibits good functional group compatibility, mild reaction conditions, good yield, and readily available reagents. Importantly, this study presents an unprecedented radical&#8208;involved process for fluorothiolation.

         <title>Access to saturated aza&#8208;heterocycles using the Borrowing Hydrogen methodology</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Borrowing hydrogen (BH) has reached a wide attention from the chemistry community as a new opportunity to construct efficiently C&#8208;N bond (as well as C&#8208;C or C&#8208;S bond) without any activation. This straightforward strategy is usually supported by relevant organometallic catalysts, involved in the dehydrogenation&#8208;reduction processes. This concept highlights specifically the application of the borrowing hydrogen to the preparation of saturated aza&#8208;heterocycles (piperidines, pyrrolidines and piperazines) extensively present in high&#8208;added value molecules of pharmaceutical industry over the last 40 years using homogenous catalysis in particular. A focus will be given to the appropriate metals (Ru, Ir and more recently earth&#8208;abundant metals) used for this transformation. An extension to chiral induction in order to prepare enantiopure N&#8208;heterocycles will be also reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Decatungstate&#8208;Catalyzed Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Formation Between Furfural and Electron&#8208;Deficient Olefins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Furfural is produced on a large commercial scale from lignocellulose and can be used for the preparation of several industrial chemicals with four to five carbon atoms. Further functionalization of furfural by C&#8211;H activation, however, is less widely developed. In the present work, tetrabutylammonium decatungstate is investigated as an inexpensive photocatalyst for activating the aldehyde C&#8211;H bond and mediate a coupling between furfural and electron&#8208;deficient olefins. The results show that furfural can be successfully added to benzylidene malononitriles, acrylates, itaconic anhydride, maleic anhydride, 2&#8208;vinylpyridine and phenyl vinyl sulfone to generate the corresponding furanyl ketones in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields. The electronic properties of the electron&#8208;deficient olefins are instrumental for achieving a favorable reaction with furfural. The findings show how photocatalysis can be used to form new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds from a platform molecule, which in this way can be converted into a number of more advanced structures.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A novel nickel&#8208;catalyzed practical and simple synthesis of thioesters from amides and disulfides has been developed. Diverse substituted aromatic amides are capable of coupling with diaryl or dialkyl disulfides via C&#8208;N/S&#8208;S bonds cleavage to produce the desirable thioesters in moderate to good yields. This procedure features cheap metals, novel and easily preparative substrates, providing a simple and practical access to a variety of thioesters without toxic thiols or CO gas.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalysed Transfer Hydrogenation Reactions with Glycerol and Carbohydrates as Hydrogen Donors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysed transfer hydrogenation using non&#8208;toxic, low cost and renewable biomass as hydrogen donors represents a sustainable and promising approach for the reduction of organic compounds. In this context, glycerol and carbohydrates are attractive hydrogen donors. In this review, we explore various catalytic systems that have been reported for reducing various unsaturated compounds, as well as the advantages and challenges associated with biomass in transfer hydrogenation reactions.







Abstract
Catalytic transfer hydrogenation is a practical approach for reduction of various unsaturated compounds and an alternative to pressurised hydrogenation and traditional metal hydride reagents. Among the various hydrogen donors, biomass such as glycerol and carbohydrates received considerable attention for the reduction reactions due to their non&#8208;toxic, eco&#8208;friendly and renewable nature. The present review addresses the development of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts for the transfer hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds, alkenes, alkynes, nitro compounds, CO2 etc. using glycerol and carbohydrates as potential hydrogen donors.

         <title>A gem&#8208;Dibromocyclopropane Ring&#8208;Expansion/Mizoroki&#8208;Heck Cyclisation Route to Tetrahydrodibenzofurans</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Readily accessible and oxygenated 6,6&#8208;dibromobicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes undergo ring&#8208;opening/nucleophilic trapping reactions with isovanillin to afford adducts that can be engaged in intramolecular Mizoroki&#8208;Heck reactions to give tetrahydrodibenzofurans. Variations in the manner in which the first step of the reaction sequence is carried out can be used to alter the regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;chemical forms of both the intermediate and final products.







Abstract
Readily accessible, oxygenated 6,6&#8208;dibromobicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes react with isovanillin in the presence of silver salts and an inorganic base to afford ring&#8208;expanded/nucleophilic trapping products of various regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;chemical forms. Most such products undergo efficient, intramolecular Mizoroki&#8208;Heck reactions to give the corresponding tetrahydrodibenzofurans. In certain cases, simple variations in the first step of such reaction sequences enables the preparation distinct ring&#8208;expansion products that also cyclise to give tetrahydrodibenzofurans embodying alternative substitution patterns.

         <title>Asymmetric Organocatalyzed Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Aminophosphinates via Thiourea Anion&#8208;Binding Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P&#8208;Stereogenic &#945;&#8208;aminophosphinates were obtained in high enantioselectivity via anion&#8208;binding catalysis with thiourea catalysts, further expanding the range of nucleophiles that can be used in this type of catalysis.







Abstract
Thioureas catalyze the reaction of phosphonites with in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated isoquinolinium salts to give C and P&#8208;stereogenic &#945;&#8208;aminophosphinates in high enantioselectivity (up to 96&#8201;%) and yield (up to 95&#8201;%). Low diastereoselectivity was obtained and this is rationalized in the context of a mechanistic proposal involving anion&#8208;binding catalysis of the P&#8722;C bond formation step followed by uncatalyzed Arbuzov collapse. The scope of the reaction, including a g&#8208;scale example, was demonstrated.

         <title>Intramolecular Hydrogen Atom Transfer from Unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond to Alkyl Radical</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular HAT processes initiated by heteroatom&#8208;centered radicals, aryl radicals, and vinyl radicals, have already been well developed in the past century. In contrast, the development of alkyl radical&#8208;mediated HAT reactions lagged behind. This Concept highlights recent advance in regioselective functionalization of ubiquitous unactivated C&#8722;H bonds enabled by intramolecular H&#8208;atom transfer to alkyl radicals.







Abstract
Regioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization in atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic mode has long been recognized as a prominent and challenging task due to its application in late&#8208;stage modification of complex skeletons, natural products and drugs. As a complement to transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation and carbene/nitrene insertion reactions, hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) emerges as a versatile tool for C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization and showcases significant and distinctive superiority in terms of selectivity trend and substrate scope. Intramolecular HAT processes initiated by nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;centered radicals, aryl radicals, and vinyl radicals, have already been well developed in the past century. In contrast, the development of alkyl radical&#8208;mediated HAT reactions lagged behind, although generation methods of corresponding alkyl radicals under mild conditions have gained rapid growth. Especially, selective and efficient HAT from unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H to alkyl radical is highly challenging due to their comparable BDEs and radical polarity. This Concept highlights recent advance in regioselective functionalization of ubiquitous unactivated C&#8722;H bonds enabled by intramolecular H&#8208;atom transfer to alkyl radicals.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of 3&#8208;Arylphthalides Promoted by Eaton's reagent</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convenient solvent and metal&#8208;free approach for the synthesis of a large variety of 3&#8208;arylphthalides from aromatic esters and aldehydes, combined with the antibacterial activity evaluation of selected analogues of natural phthalides against methicillin&#8208;resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).







Abstract
A rapid method has been developed for the synthesis of 3&#8208;arylphthalides from readily available starting materials. We describe herein a direct approach based on a simple Friedel&#8208;Crafts condensation between an aromatic ester and an aldehyde promoted by a mixture of phosphorus pentoxide and methanesulfonic acid (Eaton's reagent) under metal and solvent&#8208;free conditions. Due to their similarity to cytosporone E (a natural antibacterial phthalide), some of the synthesized compounds were tested as antibacterial agents against methicillin&#8208;resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus.

         <title>Synthesis and Photochemical Characterization of Indolizine Fluorophores Obtained by a Multicomponent Palladium Iodide&#8722;Catalyzed Oxidative Aminocarbonylation Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N,N&#8208;disubstituted 2&#8208;(indolizin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)acetamides with fluorescent properties are obtained in a multicomponent fashion starting from simple building blocks (2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pent&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;carbonyl compounds, CO, amines, and oxygen) through a sequential PdI2/KI&#8208;catalyzed oxidative aminocarbonylation &#8211; cyclization &#8211; aromatization process. Initially formed 2&#8208;ynamide intermediates, ensuing from Pd&#8208;catalyzed triple bond oxidative aminocarbonylation, are converted in&#8197;situ into the final products by amine&#8208;promoted intramolecular dearomative conjugate addition followed by rearomatization.







Abstract
A catalytic carbonylative method for the direct, multicomponent synthesis of indolizine fluorophores has been developed. The process is based on the PdI2/KI&#8208;catalyzed oxidative aminocarbonylation of 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pent&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;carbonyl compounds leading to the corresponding 2&#8208;ynamide intermediates, followed in&#8197;situ by 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization (by amine&#8208;promoted conjugate addition of the pyridine ring nitrogen) and aromatization, to give the finally isolated N,N&#8208;disubstituted 2&#8208;(indolizin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)acetamides. Reactions are carried out under relatively mild conditions (100&#8201;&#176;C under 20&#8197;atm of a 4&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture CO&#8722;air for 6&#8211;15&#8197;h) in MeCN as the solvent and with a low catalyst loading (0.33&#8197;mol% PdI2), in the presence of 0.5 equiv. of KI and 3 equiv. of a secondary amine. The optical properties of representative 2&#8208;(indolizin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)acetamide products have also been investigated.

         <title>Chemical Strategies for the Cleavage of the C(sp3)&#8722;F Bonds in Perfluoroalkyl Groups</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent environmental pollutants. In this work, we summarized recent progress on the chemical defluorination of PFAS via cleavage of unactivated C&#8722;F bonds in longer perfluoroalkyl groups under mild conditions (~150&#8201;&#176;C). In addition to classic reductive defluorination, the strategies featuring Lewis acidic activation and transient generation of an unsaturated bond are described.







Abstract
Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been recognized as environmental pollutants. Hence, their efficient and mild destruction is a significant research interest. While many research articles and review papers have reported the cleavage of the C(sp2)&#8722;F bonds, single C(sp3)&#8722;F bond, and CF3 groups in PFAS, in this study, limited and emerging examples of a longer&#160;perfluoroalkyl group containing at least one repeating unit of 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethylene was focused. In this&#160;Concept, we summarized recent progress on the chemical defluorination of PFAS via the cleavage of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;F bonds in longer perfluoroalkyl groups under mild conditions (~150&#8201;&#176;C). In addition to classical reductive defluorination, strategies featuring Lewis acid activation and the transient generation of an unsaturated bond were described.

         <title>Investigation into a Tetrahydroquinazoline Scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quinazoline derivatives with four points of diversification were prepared from &#946;&#8208;oxoesters obtained from ethyl acrylate and a nitroalkane. It was condensed with amidinium chlorides and further elaborated with primary amines (X=NH) or aryl mercaptans (X=S) and carboxylic acids RD&#8722;CO2H.







Abstract
A new 5,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydroquinazoline (i.&#8201;e. 1,3&#8208;diazanaphthalene) scaffold with four points of diversification RA&#8722;RD was prepared. The sequence started from nitroalkanes RCCH2NO2 (with RC = Me, Bu), ethyl acrylate and amidines RAC(NH)NH2 (with RA = Ph, 4&#8208;pyridyl) which were converted in a conjugate addition, Dieckmann condensation and pyrimidine ring formation. After transformation of the OH group in 4&#8208;position to a chloro leaving group, residues RB were introduced by nucleophilic substitution with alkyl amines RBNH2 (10 examples) or aryl thiols RBSH (two examples). Finally, the nitro group in the 6&#8208;position was reduced and the primary amino function amidated with various carboxylic acids RDCO2H. Along this seven&#8208;step sequence, eight examples of the fully decorated scaffold were prepared.

         <title>Rose&#8208;Bengal&#8208;Photocatalyzed Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling Reactions under Visible Light</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The visible&#8208;light induced cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reactions have made tremendous developments in the last few years. This review focuses on the recent advances in rose bengal photocatalyzed CDC reactions to create carbon&#8208;carbon/carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond under visible light to synthesize various important organic molecules.







Abstract
Over the past few years, organic chemistry has used the organic dye rose bengal&#8216;s ability to absorb visible light. In present&#8208;day research, the innovation of environmentally friendly processes for carbon&#8208;carbon/carbon&#8208;heteroatoms (Nitrogen, Oxygen, Sulphur, and Phosphorus) bond formation has great importance. The photocatalyzed cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reactions using rose bengal (RB) is a promising technique for creating carbon&#8208;carbon/carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds directly from readily available compounds. Our review focuses on the current advancement in rose bengal that uses photocatalyzed carbon&#8208;carbon/carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;making reactions to synthesize various important organic molecules via CDC reactions.

         <title>An Organic Chemist's Guide to Fluorophores &#8211; Understanding Common and Newer Non&#8208;Planar Fluorescent Molecules for Biological Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores methods for optimizing emission wavelength, quantum yield and photostability of traditional and newer non&#8208;planar fluorophores (squaraine&#8208;rotaxanes and cycloparaphenylenes). We focus on the fundamental physical organic chemistry concepts leading to the fluorescent properties. We provide a detailed tutorial to understand fluorescence and enable the design of superior fluorophores for chemical biology.Social media promotion:







Abstract
Labeling and detection of biomolecules in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo is essential to many areas of biomedical science. Fluorophores stand as indispensable tools within chemical biology, underscoring the importance of fine&#8208;tuning their optical properties. This review focuses on methods for optimizing emission wavelength, quantum yield and photostability. We focus not just on the trends, but the fundamental physical organic chemistry concepts that inform the connection between molecular structure and fluorescent properties. This approach offers an essential understanding of fluorescence, enabling readers to develop a systematic analytical framework for thinking about fluorescence. Furthermore, an evaluation of newer non&#8208;planar fluorophores shines light on the bright future of fluorescent molecules.

A new self&#8208;supported Rh2A4 species has been prepared by reductive ligation of RhCl3 with adamantane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarboxylic acid. The catalyst has been demonstrated to be suitable for a range of nitrene transfer reactions, while also being suitable for carbene transfer. Importantly, the catalyst can be made in a one&#8208;pot two step procedure and used directly, as well as being reusable.







Abstract
The bimetallic rhodium(II) paddlewheel (Rh2A4) complex is one of the most reactive classes of rhodium catalysts, well&#8208;renowned for the most demanding carbene&#8208; and nitrene&#8208;transfer reactions. In view of its importance in modern synthetic chemistry, we herein report a facile approach for preparing a self&#8208;supported and reusable dirhodium(II) polymer&#8208;based heterogeneous catalyst through a reductive ligation protocol. The catalyst displays good reactivity for inter&#8208; and intramolecular nitrene&#8208; and carbene&#8208;insertions of various olefins, and can also engage in C&#8722;H insertion of hydrocarbon derivatives, all under ambient conditions. The catalyst reusability is expected to empower the use of these precious metal catalysts at industrial scales.

         <dc:description>
&#8220;Rien ne se perd, rien ne se cr&#233;e&#8221;: N&#8208;aryl arylthioacetamides could be formed via base&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction of anilines, phenylacetylenes and elemental sulfur with complete atom efficiency.







Abstract
In the presence of a base catalyst (20&#8197;mol&#8201;%) such as DBU, DABCO or Na2S&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O/N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone, phenylacetylenes were found to efficiently undergo sulfurative amination with elemental sulfur and anilines under neat conditions, leading to N&#8208;aryl thioamides with complete atom efficiency.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Mediated Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling Reaction of Pyrrole and Indole Derivatives with Thiols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed earth&#8208;abundant copper&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H thiolations of pyrrole and indole derivatives with simple thiol reagents by employing a removable pyridyl directing group.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;mediated C(sp2)&#8722;H thiolation of pyrrole and indole derivatives with commercially available thiols utilizing a removable monodentate directing group is described. This protocol tolerated a broad range of functional groups and provided the thiolated products in 40&#8201;%&#8211;97&#8201;% yields. Furthermore, the synthetic utility of this protocol was demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive tryptophan peptide. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that a Cu(II)/Cu(III) reaction model is most likely to be involved in this C&#8722;H thiolation.

This is an account of our efforts to develop new reactions with &#8220;unusual&#8221; functional groups, namely sulfamates, phosphoramidates, and di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl silanols.







Abstract
Compared to ubiquitous functional groups such as alcohols, carboxylic acids, amines, and amides, which serve as central &#8220;actors&#8221; in most organic reactions, sulfamates, phosphoramidates, and di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl silanols have historically been viewed as &#8220;extras&#8221;. Largely considered functional group curiosities rather than launch&#8208;points of vital reactivity, the chemistry of these moieties is under&#8208;developed. Our research program has uncovered new facets of reactivity of each of these functional groups, and we are optimistic that the chemistry of these fascinating molecules can be developed into truly general transformations, useful for chemists across multiple disciplines. In the ensuing sections, I will describe our efforts to develop new reactions with these &#8220;unusual&#8221; functional groups, namely sulfamates, phosphoramidates, and di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl silanols.

A ready to synthesize bis(prolinamide)terpyridine ligand self&#8208;assembles with zinc(II) and a a hydrogen bond donor ligand to furnish a highly active catalyst for the asymmetric aldol reaction.







Abstract
A zinc(II)&#8208;templated catalyst assembling terpyridine and bipyridine organocatalytic ligands has been developed for the asymmetric aldol reaction. The system has been optimized to maximize the formation of the heteromeric bifunctional species through the determination of the equilibrium constants leading to the formation of all the species present. A practical, easy to synthesize catalytic system providing high stereoselectivity has been achieved in this way.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Annulation&#8211;Iodosulfonylation of Indole&#8208;Tethered 1,6&#8208;Enynes to Access Pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indole tethered 1,6&#8208;enynes were designed and prepared for the first time and then used to achieve an electrochemical annulation&#8208;iodosulfonylation reaction. The reaction of indole&#8208;tethered 1,6&#8208;enynes with arylsulfonyl hydrazide and KI led to unprecedented iodosulfonated pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoles in moderate to high yields under sustainable electrochemical oxidative conditions, which may open new avenues for the formation of pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoles.







Abstract
We present the first example of electrocatalytic three&#8208;component annulation&#8211;iodosulfonylation of indole&#8208;tethered 1,6&#8208;enynes with arylsulfonyl hydrazides and KI for accessing various iodosulfonated pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoles in moderate to excellent yields with high stereospecificity.

     alt="Electrocatalytic Annulation&#8211;Iodosulfonylation of Indole-Tethered 1,6-Enynes to Access Pyrrolo[1,2-a]indoles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indole tethered 1,6-enynes were designed and prepared for the first time and then used to achieve an electrochemical annulation-iodosulfonylation reaction. The reaction of indole-tethered 1,6-enynes with arylsulfonyl hydrazide and KI led to unprecedented iodosulfonated pyrrolo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]indoles in moderate to high yields under sustainable electrochemical oxidative conditions, which may open new avenues for the formation of pyrrolo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]indoles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present the first example of electrocatalytic three-component annulation&#8211;iodosulfonylation of indole-tethered 1,6-enynes with arylsulfonyl hydrazides and KI for accessing various iodosulfonated pyrrolo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]indoles in moderate to excellent yields with high stereospecificity. This electrosynthesis opens new avenues for the construction of pyrrolo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]indoles skeleton with good functional group compatibility under environmentally benign condition. Based on the control experiments and cyclic voltammetry data, we suggested the plausible reaction mechanism which included anodic oxidation, homolysis of arylsulfonyl iodide, arylsulfonyl radical addition, &lt;i&gt;5&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;dig&lt;/i&gt; cyclization, radical coupling or nucleophilic attack of iodide ions cascade.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>C&#8208;Centered radical intermediates for C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds functionalization: An emerging approach towards alkyl thiocyanates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review focuses on the recent strategies developed for the thiocyanation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds via the formation of a C&#8208;centered radical intermediate. These approaches have provided easy access to original thiocyanate products of high interest.







Abstract
Organic thiocyanates are an important class of compounds because they are present in several bioactive molecules and can be used as key synthetic intermediates to access biorelevant sulfur&#8208;containing scaffolds. Although the chemistry of organothiocyanates has been studied for decades, a recent resurgence of interest in the field has led to major advances in the synthesis of new molecules bearing a thiocyanate moiety. An emerging and powerful strategy consists in the selective functionalization of C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds through the formation of a key C&#8208;centered radical intermediate. This review highlights the recent work that has been reported to access novel alkylthiocyanate scaffolds through this promising approach.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Ring Opening Reactions of Vinylcyclopropanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vinylcyclopropanes can be generally classified as activated and unactivated VCPs. Activated VCPs have strong electron withdrawing groups present in the cyclopropane ring, while unactivated VCPs lack strong electron withdrawing groups in their structures. These VCPs can be activated using suitable asymmetric catalysts to afford various types of chiral ring&#8208;opened products that are synthetically valuable compounds.







Abstract
Vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs) are important building blocks with multifaceted reactivity. Catalytic asymmetric ring opening of vinylcyclopropanes is a highly efficient process to access valuable chiral molecules with diverse functionalities that can be further functionalized for a series of synthetic purposes. VCPs are very well&#8208;known substrates for cycloaddition reactions and this chemistry has been widely explored. On the contrary, despite of enormous synthetic potential, development of new innovative strategies for the catalytic, asymmetric ring opening of VCPs is somewhat underdeveloped. Recently, several significant examples have emerged in the literature for various asymmetric ring opening of both activated and unactivated vinylcyclopropanes that involve transition metal catalysis. These developments are relevant additions to the vinylcyclopropane chemistry. In this review, we aim to summarize all the catalytic asymmetric ring opening transformations reported till date and provide a comprehensive analysis of these research outcomes.

         <title>Lewis Base&#8208;Boryl Radicals Promoted Selective Mono&#8208; and Di&#8208; Hydrodechlorination of Trichloroacetamides and Acetates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
4&#8208;Dimethylaminopyridine&#160;(DMAP)&#8208; and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;boryl radicals were found to promote selective mono&#8208; or dihydrodechlorination of trichloroacetamides and acetates upon treatment with dilauroyl peroxide (DLP) as radical initiator and thiophenol as polarity reversal catalyst. Substituting the hydrogen atom donor, i.&#8201;e. Lewis base&#8208;borane, to its deuterated counterparts promoted mono&#8208; or dideuterodechlorination instead.







Abstract
Mono and dichloro&#8208;substituted organic molecules are shown to possess significant roles in various fields, especially in medicinal chemistry. One approach to synthesizing these compounds involves the selective dechlorination of easily prepared trichloromethyl compounds. Nevertheless, developing a practical approach that allows selective mono&#8208; and dihydrodechlorination is a challenging task. Herein, we introduced a method for selective mono&#8208; and dihydrodechlorination of trichloroacetamides and acetates which was promoted by two different Lewis base&#8208;boryl radicals. Accordingly, 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)&#8208;borane enabled mono&#8208;substitution of chlorine atom by hydrogen while dihydro&#8208;substitution of chlorine atoms was promoted by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;boryl radical. Using deuterated Lewis base&#8208;borane as deuterium atom source, mono&#8208; and dideuterodechlorination were also successfully took place. This protocol features broad substrate scope and operates under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Evaluating Multienzyme Cascade Routes for Pharmaceutically Relevant Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme catalysis has emerged as a greener and more sustainable approach for obtaining a variety of chiral building blocks and APIs. In recent years, researchers have successfully demonstrated various multienzyme cascade syntheses to obtain APIs. Following these breakthroughs, the application of enzyme cascade reactions is driving the industry to manufacture APIs on a multikilogram scale. This also emphasizes the promising potential of Systems Biocatalysis, which is yet to be fully harnessed for a better tomorrow. This review highlights the importance of the recently developed multienzyme cascade synthesis of pharmaceutically important bioactive molecules.







Abstract
The constant demand for sustainable approaches to pharmaceutical synthesis has thrived the enzyme catalysis (biocatalysis) field. The most sought&#8208;after features like high specificity, environmentally benign, and biodegradable nature have rendered enzymatic processes predominantly eco&#8208;friendly. Owing to these merits, biocatalysis is now being developed extensively to exploit their applications in designing alternate and sustainable synthetic routes for manufacturing pharmaceuticals, in line with green chemistry principles. Further, combining multiple enzymes in one&#8208;pot is a highly efficient methodology as it eliminates intermediate isolation, shifts equilibrium in the forward direction, and proceeds in ambient aqueous conditions. This review highlights the importance of recently developed multienzyme cascade synthesis of pharmaceutically important bioactive molecules by relating them with their well&#8208;known chemical route.

         <title>Catalytic C(sp2)&#8722;H Trifluoroethylation of Indoles via Iron&#8208;Carbene Insertion</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A iron&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H bond trifluoroethylation of electron&#8208;rich aromatic system using N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones as carbene precursor is reported. This method allowed for the trifluoroethylation of indoles in high yield with excellent functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Pharmacological properties of a bioactive molecule can be improved significantly by placing a fluoroalkyl group on its scaffold. However, direct stitching of fluoroalkyl groups to aromatic compounds via C&#8722;H bond activation or insertion reaction is a difficult task, thus challenging and of high demand. Herein, an alternative to the Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation, we describe an uncharted strategy for selective and efficient trifluoroethylation of indole that relies on iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation of aromatic compounds and proceeds via Fe(III)&#8208;carbene insertion into C(sp2)&#8722;H bond of indole using trifluoroacetaldehyde N&#8208;triftosylhydrazone as a carbene precursor and FeTPPCl as catalyst.

         <title>Synthesis, Reactivity and Application of Vinyl Sulfoximines and Vinyl Aminosulfoxonium Salts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the multifaceted chemistry of vinyl sulfoximines and vinyl aminosulfoxonium salts is discussed. Emphasis is placed on the application in asymmetric synthesis. The discussion focuses on functionalized vinyl sulfoximines and vinyl aminosulfoxonium salts, as well as transformations that exploit the nucleofugacity of the sulfonimidoyl and aminosulfoxonium group.







Abstract
The combination of a sulfonimidoyl and aminosulfoxonium group with a double bond renders vinyl sulfoximines and vinyl aminosulfoxonium salts particularly versatile classes of compounds in organic synthesis. The discussion of vinyl sulfoximines includes in addition to the synthesis, the Michael reaction and its application in asymmetric synthesis, the synthesis, structure and application of &#945;&#8208;lithiovinyl sulfoximines, the nickel&#8208;catalyzed and copper&#8208;mediated anionic cross&#8208;coupling reaction of &#945;&#8208;metallovinyl sulfoximines, the synthesis of acyclic and cyclic dienyl vinyl sulfoximines and the ring&#8208;closing metathesis, the hydroalumination and reductive Pauson&#8208;Khand reaction, the nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction, the vinyl&#8208;allyl isomerization, the cycloaddition, and the cyclization. The discussion of vinyl aminosulfoxonium salts includes in addition to the synthesis, the Michael reaction, the ethylenation of protic nucleophiles, the synthesis of allyl aminosulfoxonium salts and the nucleophilic substitution, the synthesis of allyl aminosulfoxonium ylides and the imino ester aziridination, the synthesis of vinyl aminosulfoxonium ylides, the synthesis of alkynes and dihydrofurans, the nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction, and the intramolecular substitution of the amino group.

         <title>A Practical, Scalable Synthesis of 1,18&#8208;Octadecanedioic acid&#8208;Paclitaxel (ODDA&#8208;PTX)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Paclitaxel is one of the most important chemotherapy agents and it has shown activity against a variety of human cancers. In the past years several derivatives and formulations have been developed to improve its activity and reduce its toxicity. Recently, 1,18&#8208;Octadecanedioic acid&#8208;Paclitaxel (ODDA&#8208;PTX), obtained by conjugation of Paclitaxel with a long&#8208;chain diacid, has emerged as a promising Paclitaxel prodrug, with high efficacy and low toxicity. A novel strategy for its synthesis has been developed and is herein described. The approach is based on the mono&#8208;allyl protection of octadecanedioic acid (ODDA) and on the Pd&#8208;catalyzed removal of the allyl ester after coupling with Paclitaxel. This strategy is superior to previously reported procedures in that it affords the ODDA&#8208;PTX product with much higher purity, avoids chromatographic purifications and can be practically scaled&#8208;up for the industrial production of ODDA&#8208;PTX.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperativity in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Macrocycles Derived from Nucleobases</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical analyses reveal that introducing rigid linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated acetylene linkers into a supramolecular building block hampers the cooperative self&#8208;assembly of hydrogen&#8208;bonded macrocycles. This effect originates from the electron abstracting capability of the linker and becomes amplified when the size of the linker increases.







Abstract
Introducing a rigid linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated acetylene linker into a supramolecular building block consisting of a hydrogen&#8208;bond donor side and a hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor side yields a decrease in cooperativity in the resulting formed quartet. This follows from our Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital and Voronoi deformation density analyses of hydrogen&#8208;bonded macrocycles based on guanine and cytosine nucleobases. The acetylene linker abstracts electron density from the hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor and donor, making the hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor more negatively charged and the hydrogen&#8208;bond donor more positively charged and hence suppressing the donor&#8211;acceptor charge transfer interaction between the interacting fragments. This, ultimately, hampers the cooperativity in the hydrogen&#8208;bonded macrocycle. We envision that these findings could open the door to new design principles for the development of novel hydrogen&#8208;bond supramolecular macrocycles.

         <title>Organocatalytic Asymmetric Reduction of &#948;&#8208;Nitro Dienes: a Viable Entry to Functionalized Amines and Highly Substituted Enantioenriched Cyclopentanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new asymmetric organocatalytic reaction to afford enantioenriched &#948;&#8208;nitro alkene analogues and their synthetic manipulation are presented. The chiral nitro alkene was further used in a stereoselective cyclization reaction to afford an almost enantiomerically pure highly functionalised cyclopentane featuring five contiguous stereocenters.







Abstract
&#948;&#8208;nitro dienes were successfully synthesized and converted to &#948;&#8208;nitro alkenes with complete chemo and regioselectivity. The enantioselective organocatalytic reduction was also accomplished and afforded the product in up to 97&#8201;% e.e. The chiral nitro alkene was further elaborated and employed as starting material in a stereoselective cyclization reaction that led to an almost enantiomerically pure highly functionalised cyclopentane featuring 5 contiguous stereocenters.

The 2H&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;4,6&#8208;dioxo&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazine (TDO) ring model of alchivemycins, an unprecedented structural motif in natural products, was synthesized via two routes. Both routes involved the intramolecular trapping of an acylketene intermediate by an internal hydroxy group as a key step. A DMAP&#8722;CaCl2&#8208;mediated O&#8208; to C&#8208;acyl migration reaction enabled installation of an acyl group at the C5 position of an unstable TDO intermediate.







Abstract
The 2H&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;4,6&#8208;dioxo&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazine (TDO) ring, a rare structural motif embedded in the molecular architecture of alchivemycins, is synthesized from 2,2,6&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxin&#8208;4&#8208;one via two routes. Both routes involve the intramolecular trapping of an acylketene intermediate by an internal hydroxy group to form the TDO ring as a key step. The first synthesis was achieved in 29&#8201;% overall yield from the starting material by a four&#8208;step sequence featuring a DMAP&#8722;CaCl2&#8208;mediated O&#8208; to C&#8208;acyl migration reaction to install an acyl group at the C5 position of the TDO ring. The second synthesis was completed in 8&#8201;% overall yield from the same starting material as the first one through five steps by exploiting a photo&#8208;induced double bromination reaction.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we demonstrated a visible light mediated tandem oxidation&#8210;organo catalyzed C&#8210;S bond functionalization protocol for the cleavage of aromatic C&#8210;S bond. The investigation encompassed the functionalization of C&#8210;S bonds within sulfones, sulfoxides, and aliphatic sulfide derivatives. However, the process of functionalizing the C&#8210;S bond in aromatic sulfides remains uncertain. The presented protocol demonstrates the C&#8210;S bond functionalization on benzo[b]benzo[4,5]thieno[2,3&#8208;d]thiophene derivative and amines including primary and secondary amines as well. A radical mediated mechanism was proposed for the tandem oxidation&#8210;organocatalyzed C&#8210;S bond functionalization protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Iodoazolium Salts: Searching for Cooperation Between Halogen Bonding and Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;covalent interactions play an important role in all sub&#8208;fields of chemistry, including catalysis, where interactions of different natures can work together to improve reactivities and selectivities. Several families of molecules that incorporate both hydrogen bond (HB) and halogen bonding (XB) donors have already been studied. However, there is a lack of data on how grafting HB donors to iodoazolium salts could impact their association and reactivity properties. Herein, we disclose the synthesis of a library of iodoazolium salts bearing varied HB donors, along with a study of their physico&#8208;chemical properties using different techniques (X&#8208;ray diffraction, 31P NMR, ITC) and their behavior in catalysis. Even though no clear&#8208;cut evidence of cooperation between XB and HB could be obtained through physico&#8208;chemical evaluations, a iodoazolium salt bearing a urea function displayed better conversion and product selectivity in a Ritter reaction than all other activators lacking one or the other function.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbofluorination of &#960;&#8208;Bonds and Related Reactions Involving Tandem C&#8722;C/C&#8722;F Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review on the carbofluorination of &#960;&#8208;bonds and related transformations involving tandem C&#8722;C/C&#8722;F bond forming reactions is presented. The application of electrophilic fluorine and nucleophilic fluoride reagents in this chemistry is described, as well as recently developed protocols involving the use of fluorinated organic molecules in atom&#8208;economic carbofluorination reactions.







Abstract
Due to the unique properties of C&#8722;F bonds, organofluorine compounds occupy a privileged space in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and polymer industries. Carbofluorination reactions involve the formation of a C&#8722;C and a C&#8722;F bond, typically across a &#960;&#8208;bond or another unsaturated functionality that is revealed upon in situ activation. The design of tailored substrates and new catalyst systems has enabled carbofluorination chemistry to emerge as a promising manifold for the synthesis of unique fluorinated scaffolds. This review covers the application of nucleophilic and electrophilic fluorinating reagents in this chemistry, in addition to recently developed atom&#8208;economical carbofluorination reactions using organofluorine compounds as dual reagents.
