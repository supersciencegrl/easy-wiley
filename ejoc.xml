         <title>Expeditious and Stereoselective Synthesis of (1S)&#8208;Spiro[pyran&#8208;4&#8208;quinolines]</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spiro[pyran&#8208;4&#8208;quinolines] were synthesized in two steps from  exo  &#8208;glycals. The first step involved the double additions of aniline (or substituted anilines) to produce  C,N  &#8208;glycosides. The next step was to eliminate the anomeric  N&#8208;  aryl group by formation of benzophenone&#8208;derived imine, followed by  in&#8208;situ  intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation. The two steps could be performed consecutively in one&#8208;pot manner at 75 &#176;C, leading to formation of (1  S  )&#8208;spiro[pyran&#8208;4&#8208;quinolines] in 60&#8208;72% overall yields with exclusive (from the reactions of  exo  &#8208;galactals) or high stereoselectivity (from those of  exo  &#8208;glucals with  m  &#8208;substituted anilines), respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Electro&#8208;Optical Properties of Mixed&#8208;Halide Trityl Radicals Bearing para&#8208;Brominated Positions through Halogen Substitution</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, the synthesis and characterization of two new trityl radicals bearing two  p  &#8208;brominated positions,  i.e.  the 2,2'&#8208;((perchlorophenyl)methylene)bis(1,3,5&#8208;tribromobenzene) radical and the 6,6'&#8208;((perchlorophenyl)methylene)bis(3&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene) radical, are presented. Slightly modifying the strategy typically used for the synthesis of non&#8208;symmetric mixed&#8208;halide trityl radicals, we were able to considerably increase the reaction yield for the radical precursors. In addition, for the first time the electro&#8208;optical properties of a highly fluorinated trityl radical were studied, achieving the most blue&#8208;shifted emission for a trityl radical reported up to now. &#160;Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations carried out to supplement the experimental investigation, support the electrochemical and spectroscopic data and rationalize the observed blue shift of the highly fluorinated species.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Oxetanes Based on the Combination of Azides and Tetrazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Literature known energetic oxetane derivatives have a nitrogen content of up to 49.98%. Through the introduction of azide and tetrazole functionalities attached to an oxetane ring, energetic oxetanes with higher nitrogen contents than previously reported in the literature were obtained.

Methylation with dimethyl sulfate, amination with O&#8208;tosylhydroxyl&#8208;amine (TOSA) and hydroxylation with Oxone&#174; yielded (mostly) isomers of the respective target molecules 4&#8208;Iso1, 4&#8208;Iso2, 5&#8208;Iso1, 5&#8208;Iso2 and 6&#8208;Iso2. The newly synthesized oxetane derivatives were extensively characterized via 1H NMR, 13C{1H} NMR, 14N NMR, 15N NMR, 1H&#8208;15N HMBC, FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy and/or DTA. Their crystal structures were elucidated using X&#8208;ray diffraction, their sensitivities towards impact, friction and electrostatic discharge were determined and their energetic properties were calculated using the EXPLO5 code.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a C&#8208;H activation protocol of 2&#8208;arylbenzoxazinones in aqueous medium under open aerial atmosphere at close to room temperature (40 oC) using magnetic Pd&#8208;catalyst. 2&#8208;Arylbenzoxazinones react with phenylglyoxylic acids via decarboxylative C&#8208;H acylation followed by cyclization reaction to produce the isoindolinone compounds. The reaction can be arrested at the intermediate step to obtain the ortho&#8208;acylated derivative at a certain lower temperature. The heterogeneous Pd&#8208;catalyst is easy to separate magnetically and shows good recyclability.</dc:description>

In this work, an operationally simple, one&#8208;pot, straightforward synthesis of N&#8208;aryl &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;lactams has been disclosed. Readily available, cheap &#947;&#8208;/&#948;&#8208;amino acids and aryl halides were used as starting materials to synthesize a variety of N&#8208;aryl &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;lactams by using copper&#8208;mediated cascade intramolecular amidation/C&#8722;N&#8208;coupling sequence.







Abstract

         <title>Improving Site Selectivity in Phosphorylation of Amphiphilic Diols through Catalyst Design</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organocatalysts based on a nucleophilic core, decorated with long hydrocarbon or oligoether outer&#8208;sphere tails were successfully applied for attenuating the site selectivity in phosphorylation of a model amphiphilic diol. Under the influence of the catalysts, the preference for the first functionalization of the hydroxyl at the apolar domain increased dramatically to render the ratio of up to 3.9:1 between the monophosphorylated products, at 50 % substrate consumption (vs. 1.8:1 in the alike reaction without the catalyst). A considerable influence of the catalyst design, particularly the core nature and the tails structure, on the rate and the selectivity of the reaction was observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Bidentate N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Phosphinidene Supported Si(IV) Dicationic Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the synthesis and isolation of Si(IV) dications stabilized by a bidentate  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphinidene (NHCP). Treatment of the bis(NHCP) with Si(IV) bis(triflate) (R  2  Si(OTf)  2  with R = H, Ph) resulted in the instant formation of Si(IV) dicationic complexes [  2a  ] and [  2b  ] featuring a tetracoordinated silicon centre. The dications show expected high Lewis acidity. The bis(NHCP) stabilized parent silyl dication (SiH  2  2+  ) presents the first isolable example of a parent SiH  2  dication. In addition, dication [  2a  ] is able to react with diphenylketene via insertion into the Si&#8722;P bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Dibenziodolium Salts as Halogen Bond Donor Catalysts for the Reduction of Quinolines, One&#8208;Pot Reductive Amination, and Addition Reaction with Indoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 41, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dibenziodolium salts were utilized as efficient halogen bond donor catalysts for carrying out the reduction of quinolines, one&#8208;pot reductive amination, Michael addition reaction of indoles with chalcones, and Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction of indoles with isatin. NMR studies suggest the presence of halogen bond.







Abstract
The efficiency of dibenziodolium salts as halogen bond donor catalysts was investigated by studying various organic transformations. Diverse reactions were carried out with low catalytic loading and under mild conditions. The catalyst was found to be efficient for carrying out the reduction of quinolines, one&#8208;pot reductive amination, Michael addition reaction of indoles with chalcones, and Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction of indoles with isatin with a low catalytic loading of 3&#8197;mol&#8201;%. A wide substrate scope was attempted for all the transformations. Several control experiments were carried to rule out the possibility of hidden Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. NMR studies and preliminary DFT calculations suggest the presence of halogen bond between the catalyst and the substrate.

         <title>Direct Boronic Acid Promoted Amidation of Carboxylic Acids with Poorly Nucleophilic Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 41, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thioether&#8208;substituted biphenylboronic acid, 1e, promotes the direct amidation reaction of various anilines at 85&#8201;&#176;C in fluorobenzene, including halogenated anilines, electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient anilines, and the heterocyclic quinolin&#8208;6&#8208;amine. Variations of the aliphatic carboxylic acid are possible, affording the corresponding anilides in good yields. The efficiency and recyclability of boronic acid 1e were demonstrated on a gram&#8208;scale amidation reaction.







Abstract
Direct amidation of carboxylic acids with poorly nucleophilic amines such as anilines is a notorious challenge in organic chemistry. Previously reported methodologies for direct amidation tend to report none or just a few examples with simple anilines, which generally react at temperatures over 100&#8201;&#176;C. To address this challenge and develop a mild and direct dehydrative anilide synthesis, herein a series of novel boronic acids with a biphenyl scaffold were prepared based on a design concept of bifunctional activation. The optimal thioether&#8208;substituted biphenylboronic acid, 1e, exhibits good reactivity in promoting the amidation reaction of various anilines at 85&#8201;&#176;C in fluorobenzene, including halogenated anilines, electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient anilines, and the heterocyclic 6&#8208;aminoquinoline. Variations of the aliphatic carboxylic acid are possible, affording the corresponding anilides in good yields. The efficiency and recyclability of boronic acid 1e were demonstrated on a gram&#8208;scale amidation reaction.

         <title>A Multicomponent Approach to Imidazo[2,1&#8208;b]thiazole Derivatives by Sequential PdI2/KI&#8208;Catalyzed Deprotective Oxidative Aminocarbonylation &#8211; Dearomative Cyclization &#8211; Aromatization</title>

         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Boc&#8208;N&#8208;propargylthiazol&#8208;2&#8208;amines can be converted in one step and in multicomponent fashion to high value added imidazo[2,1&#8208;b]thiazole derivatives, when allowed to react with CO, a secondary amine, and O2 under the catalysis of PdI2/KI. The process, leading to 2&#8208;(imidazo[2,1&#8208;b]thiazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dialkylacetamides in yields up to 87&#8201;%, occurs through an ordered sequence of steps, involving N&#8208;deprotection, oxidative aminocarbonylation of the triple bond, dearomative cyclization, and aromative isomerization.







Abstract
We report a direct, multicomponent approach to an important class of fused&#8208;ring heterocycles, namely, imidazo[2,1&#8208;b]thiazole derivatives starting from simple and readily available building blocks (N&#8208;Boc&#8208;N&#8208;propargylthiazol&#8208;2&#8208;amines, carbon monoxide, a secondary amine, and oxygen). The process takes place under the catalysis of the simple PdI2/KI system under relatively mild conditions (100&#8201;&#176;C under 20&#8197;atm of a 4&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of CO&#8208;air), and leads to 2&#8208;(imidazo[2,1&#8208;b]thiazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dialkylacetamides in yields up to 87&#8201;%. The mechanistic pathway leading to carbonylated imidazo[2,1&#8208;b]thiazole occurs through an ordered sequence of steps, involving amine&#8208;induced N&#8208;deprotection, oxidative aminocarbonylation of the triple bond (with Csp&#8722;H activation and formation of a 2&#8208;ynamide intermediate), dearomative cyclization (by intramolecular conjugate addition of thioazolic nitrogen to the 2&#8208;ynamide moiety) and aromatization by proton&#8208;shift isomerization. When starting from N&#8208;Boc&#8208;N&#8208;(propargyl)benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;amine, tricyclic benzimidazothiazoles were formed in moderate yields.

The process, leading to 2-(imidazo[2,1-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]thiazol-5-yl)-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-dialkylacetamides in yields up to 87&#8201;%, occurs through an ordered sequence of steps, involving &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-deprotection, oxidative aminocarbonylation of the triple bond, dearomative cyclization, and aromative isomerization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a direct, multicomponent approach to an important class of fused-ring heterocycles, namely, imidazo[2,1-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]thiazole derivatives starting from simple and readily available building blocks (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Boc-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-propargylthiazol-2-amines, carbon monoxide, a secondary amine, and oxygen). The process takes place under the catalysis of the simple PdI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/KI system under relatively mild conditions (100&#8201;&#176;C under 20&#8197;atm of a 4&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of CO-air), and leads to 2-(imidazo[2,1-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]thiazol-5-yl)-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-dialkylacetamides in yields up to 87&#8201;%. The mechanistic pathway leading to carbonylated imidazo[2,1-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]thiazole occurs through an ordered sequence of steps, involving amine-induced &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-deprotection, oxidative aminocarbonylation of the triple bond (with C&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;H activation and formation of a 2-ynamide intermediate), dearomative cyclization (by intramolecular conjugate addition of thioazolic nitrogen to the 2-ynamide moiety) and aromatization by proton-shift isomerization. When starting from &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Boc-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(propargyl)benzo[&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]thiazol-2-amine, tricyclic benzimidazothiazoles were formed in moderate yields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydroarylation of Allenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 41, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroarylation of allenes leads to the selective formation of highly valuable allylic or vinylic structures through C&#8722;C bond formation. In this frame, transition metal&#8208;based catalysts have been broadly employed. This review highlights this topic, discussing advantages, limitations and mechanistic aspects of the related methods over the four last decades.







Abstract
The intermolecular transition&#8208;metal catalyzed hydroarylation of allenes has been widely explored since the early 1980s. This reaction allows the selective access to high&#8208;value allylic or vinylic motifs through the formation of C&#8722;C bonds. In this frame, arenes (ArH), which are employed without any pre&#8208;functionalisation, represent one of the most used families of aryl sources. Organoboronic derivatives (acids ArB(OH)2 and esters ArB(OR)2) constitute alternative, accessible and generally more reactive coupling partners, while aryl halides (ArX) are a third, less used type of aryl source. Whereas gold&#8208; and palladium&#8208;based catalysts are often used with arenes and aryl boronic derivatives, respectively, as aryl sources, a wide range of other transition metals have also been employed. Experimental and theoretical studies have often been reported, thus affording mechanistic insights and allowing to suggest catalytic cycles.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Rich Carbon Dots as Novel Nano&#8208;Aminocatalytic Platforms in Organic Synthesis</title>

From N&#8208;containing molecular precursors to amine&#8208;rich CDs: a journey into sustainable and green opportunities for aminocatalytic methodologies. The analysis of the most explicative examples provides a panoramic view on the progress toward the preparation and application of amine&#8208;bearing CDs as catalysts for transformations of synthetical importance.







Abstract
The development of novel and effective metal&#8208;free catalytic systems, which can drive value&#8208;added organic transformations in environmentally benign solvents (for instance, water), is highly desirable. Moreover, these new catalysts need to be harmless, easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare, and potentially recyclable. In this context, amine&#8208;rich carbon dots (CDs) have recently emerged as promising nano&#8208;catalytic platforms. These nitrogen&#8208;doped nanoparticles, which show dimensions smaller than 10&#8197;nm, generally consist of carbon cores that are surrounded by shells containing numerous amino groups. In recent years, organic chemists have used these surface amines to guide the design of several synthetic methodologies under mild operative conditions. This Concept highlights the recent advances in the synthesis of amine&#8208;rich carbon dots and their applications in organic catalysis, including forward&#8208;looking opportunities within this research field.

         <title>Synthesis of Non&#8208;anomeric Spiro&#8208;Fused Bicyclic Sugar Derivatives by Light&#8208;Mediated 1,5&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) Process</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 41, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and efficient synthesis for the construction of the complex non&#8208;anomeric spiro&#8208;fused bicyclic sugar derivatives from glycosyl 6&#8208;trichloroacetimidates under visible light conditions was developed. The overall reaction proceeds via in&#8197;situ generation of imidate nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals followed by 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer to form the intramolecular carbon&#8208;nitrogen (C&#8722;N) bond.







Abstract
We report a metal&#8208;free, diastereoselective approach for the syntheses of conformationally locked spiro bicyclic sugars bearing a quaternary center at C5 position. The oxazoline&#8208;containing spiro&#8208;bicyclic system has been built in one step from easily synthesizable C6&#8208;glycosylimidates under visible light conditions. The overall transformation proceeds with the formation of an intramolecular C&#8722;N bond through the activation of appropriately positioned C&#8722;H bond via in&#8197;situ generation of an imidate nitrogen radical followed by an intramolecular 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) in the presence of NaI/PIDA reagents. Mild reaction conditions, green source of energy, broad substrate scope, scale&#8208;up synthesis, and high reaction yields are some of the key features of the developed protocol.

         <title>Photochemical 1,3&#8208;Acyl Shifts in Natural Product Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 41, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical, sigmatropic 1,3&#8208;acyl shifts represent a powerful tool to construct quaternary carbon atoms and the backbones of complex natural products which cannot be constructed easily by conventional methods. The discussed applications of 1,3&#8208;acyl shifts in total syntheses highlight (i) the stereospecific reaction mechanism, (ii) the tolerance of versatile protecting groups, and (iii) their role in putative biosyntheses.

Photochemical, sigmatropic 1,3&#8208;acyl shifts represent a powerful tool to construct quaternary carbon atoms and the backbones of complex natural products which cannot be constructed easily by conventional methods. This review highlights applications of 1,3&#8208;acyl shifts to elegant, partly biomimetic total syntheses of natural products by discussing the underlying photochemical equilibrium.

         <title>Post&#8208;Modification of Amino Acids and Peptides for the Rapid Synthesis of C&#8208;Glycoamino Acids and C&#8208;Glycopeptides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 41, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the growing interest in C&#8208;glycoamino acids and C&#8208;glycoproteins for their wide occurrence in natural products, excellent pharmacodynamic properties and dynamic stability, powerful strategy to rapidly synthesize them is highly desirable. Thus, several post&#8208;modifications of amino acids and peptides through direct glycosylation reactions, which could maintain the chirality of both amino acid and glycosyl moieties, and could be applied in direct peptide modification with broad functional group tolerance, have been well developed in recent years.







Abstract
Glycoamino acids and glycoproteins, especially C&#8208;glycoamino acids and C&#8208;glycoproteins, attract tremendous interests in the realm of biology and chemistry due to their wide occurrence in natural products, excellent pharmacodynamic properties and dynamic stability. Compared with the traditional construction of the amino acid or the glycosyl moiety de novo, post&#8208;modification of amino acids and peptides through direct glycosylation reactions constitute a powerful synthetic approach to attaining C&#8208;glycoamino acids and C&#8208;glycopeptides rapidly on account of the high step&#8208;economy, broad functional group tolerance, and conservation of the chirality of the amino acid and glycosyl moieties. In this review, the recent developments in the synthesis of C&#8208;glycoamino acids and C&#8208;glycopeptides via the post&#8208;modification of amino acids and peptides are summarized. Additionally, the important and representative examples, synthetic applications, and crucial mechanism investigations of these glycosylation reactions are also highlighted.

         <title>1,2&#8208;Boronate Rearrangement: An Efficient Tool for the Opening, Functionalization and Formation of Strained Cycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 41, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lately, the 1,2&#8208;boronate rearrangement has been extensively used to give access to original organoboron compounds. One of the approaches recently particularly studied is the application of this 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangement with strained cycloalkanes and oxygen&#8208; or nitrogen&#8208;containing cycles. This review covers the recent progresses reported for the synthesis, the functionalization, and the opening of these cycles by 1,2&#8208;boronate rearrangement.







Abstract
The 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangement occurring with boronate complexes is a strategy of choice for the synthesis of organoboron compounds, giving a direct access to highly functionalized molecules. Lately, significant progress has been made in the use of this reaction for the opening, the functionalization, and the formation of strained cycles. In this review, we will highlight these recent advances, focusing on cycloalkanes and oxygen&#8208; or nitrogen&#8208;containing strained cycles.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of a Pyrrolizidinone&#8208;Based hNK1 Antagonist through Reductive Ring Contraction of a Six&#8208;Membered Cyclic Nitronate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 41, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seven&#8208;step asymmetric synthesis of a potent hNK1 antagonist has been accomplished through a stereoselective reductive recyclization of a properly functionalized six&#8208;membered cyclic nitronate.







Abstract
A concise seven&#8208;step asymmetric synthesis of MSD's potent hNK1 antagonist containing a pyrrolizidinone core bearing two fluorine&#8208;substituted aryl groups was developed. The pyrrolizidinone unit was constructed by reductive recyclization of a properly functionalized cyclic nitronate, which was assembled by stereoselective [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of a nitroalkene with a vinyl ether bearing a Whitesell's chiral auxiliary group. The configuration of the hNK1 antagonist, which was previously suggested based on bioactivity data, was confirmed by X&#8208;ray analysis. The crystal structure features multiple weak interactions involving fluorine atoms that are also found in a complex with the hNK1 receptor simulated by molecular docking.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Fluoroselenides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 41, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#946;&#8208;Fluoroselenides are readily obtained by an environmentally friendly and efficient electrochemical vicinal fluoroselenation reaction of olefins with diaryl diselenides and triethylamine trihydrofluoride.







Abstract
An environmentally friendly and efficient electrochemical fluoroselenation reaction of olefins has been developed. With the use of commercially available diaryl diselenides, triethylamine trihydrofluoride, and olefins, a diverse array of &#946;&#8208;fluoroselenides could be readily obtained. The reaction conditions are mild, tolerating a wide range of substrates in excellent yields and selectivity, and can be easily extended to gram&#8208;scale preparation of vicinal fluoroselenides, too.

         <title>Cover Feature: Expeditious Synthesis of a Glycopeptide Library (Eur. J. Org. Chem. 41/2022)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 41, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature demonstrates that the stirring&#8208;assisted synthesis of glycopeptides can be as fun and easy as making cotton candy in a carnival. The amino acids and glycans are sprinkled into the cotton candy machine, indicating the equimolar quantities used for the synthesis, and following the rapid stirring the glycopeptide emerges on the other side. The developed strategy enables the synthesis of deprotected glycopeptides within minutes by using as little as equimolar quantities of glycosylated amino acids. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Ben&#8197;Abba&#8197;Amiel and M. Hurevich.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;2&#8208;Amino Thiodisaccharides by Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 41, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient methodology was developed for the synthesis of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;2&#8208;amino thiodisaccharides by using 2&#8208;nitroglycals and glycosyl thiols under bifunctional organothiourea catalysis. Galacto/gluco&#8208;2&#8208;nitroglycals and various glycosyl thiols were investigated yielding different 1,1&#8217;&#8208;2&#8208;amino thiodisaccharides in high yields with excellent &#945;&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
In this work, we report a new bifunctional organothiourea catalysis method for highly stereoselective synthesis of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;2&#8208;amino thiodisaccharides using 2&#8208;nitroglycals as donors and glycosyl thiols as acceptors. The method features excellent stereoselectivity, high yields, mild reaction conditions and broad substrate scopes. In addition, the method was successfully applied on the synthesis of the thiolated 1,1&#8217;&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;diamino disaccharide fragment of bioactive nature product tunicamycins.

A photoactive charge transfer complex protocol for the generation of cyanoalkyl radicals from cyclobutanone oxime esters with dichalcogenides is established.







Abstract
We herein report an additive&#8208;free alternative for the generation of cyanoalkyl radicals through photoinduced single electron transfer from dichalcogenides to cyclobutanone oxime esters, resulting in chalcogen&#8208;containing nitriles. Experimental and DFT studies supported the occurrence of the process between the two components.

&#945;&#8208;Bromo&#8208;&#945;&#8217;&#8208;(R)&#8208;sulfinylketones, optically pure only at the sulfur atom, hold great potential as precursors of enantiopure chiral functionalized arrangements by the stereospecific formation of nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur and carbon&#8208;carbon bonds.







Abstract
Crystallization&#8208;Induced Diastereomer Transformation (CIDT) of &#945;&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#945;&#8217;&#8208;(R)&#8208;sulfinylketones is reported. The utility of these 1,2&#8208;difunctionalized synthons is convincingly demonstrated by their facile conversion into cyanohydrins and bromohydrins. Furthermore, bromohydrins can be converted into complex arrangements of functionality and stereochemistry through SN2&#8208;like inter and intramolecular transformations.

         <title>Pyrazine Alkylation with Aldehydes and Haloalkanes Using N,N&#8217;&#8208;Bis(trimethylsilyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyrazine Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 41, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
N,N&#8217;&#8208;Bis(trimethylsilyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyrazines serves as starting materials for introducing alkyl groups into the parent pyrazine skeletons upon combined with aldehydes and nBu4NF as well as electron&#8208;deficient alkyl halides. In this reaction, activation of the trimethylsilyl moiety by fluoride is the key step for generating electron&#8208;rich silicate intermediates, while reduction of electron&#8208;deficient alkyl halides by 1&#8201;a produces radical cation [1&#8201;a]&#8901;+ for further C&#8722;C bond formation.







Abstract
N,N&#8217;&#8208;Bis(trimethylsilyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyrazines are useful starting materials for synthesizing alkylpyrazines upon combination with aldehydes and tetra(n&#8208;butyl)ammonium fluoride. Various aryl, heteroaryl, and alkyl aldehydes are utilized as sources of the alkyl substituents; reactions with electron&#8208;rich aldehydes afford the corresponding alkylpyrazines in good yields. The overall reaction sequence was clarified by DFT calculations; in this reaction, activation of the N&#8208;trimethylsilyl moiety by fluoride, forming the electron&#8208;rich silicate intermediate Int&#8208;1, is the key step for the subsequent C&#8722;C bond formation with aldehydes, and the following 1,3&#8208;proton transfer from Int&#8208;3 to Int&#8208;4 is the rate&#8208;determining step. In addition, treatment of N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyrazines (1&#8201;a) with electron&#8208;deficient alkyl halides under fluoride&#8208;free conditions affords the corresponding alkylated pyrazines.

         <title>Nintedanib&#8208;&#945;V&#946;3 Integrin Ligand Dual&#8208;Targeting Conjugates towards Precision Treatment of Melanoma</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, and more than 150,000 cases are diagnosed every year in Europe. New strategies in treatment approved over the past decade, such as immunotherapy and targeted therapy, have prolonged life expectation even in stage IV melanoma patients. However, due to the increasing incidence of this cancer, the development of new therapeutic strategies remains urgent. Recent studies revealed the combination of nintedanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved as an antifibrotic drug, and immuno&#8208; and/or targeted therapy drugs to be promising. Here we present three new dual covalent conjugates, in which a nintedanib unit is permanently linked to a cyclopeptidomimetic ligand for the &#945;V&#946;3 integrin, a transmembrane receptor involved in cell survival, proliferation and migration, which is overexpressed by tumour cells, and therefore recognized as marker for tumour targeting. In vitro assays on human melanoma tumour cells confirmed the high binding affinity of these conjugates for &#945;V&#946;3 integrin&#8208;positive melanoma cells, as well as their integrin&#8208;mediated cell internalization. Two of these conjugates were efficient in inhibiting the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway, common to both integrin&#8208; and growth factor&#8208; biological targets.
Such targeted conjugates could therefore be of special interest in melanoma treatment alone or in combination with other anticancer drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Exploration of Novel Sulfamoyl Cyanide N&#8208;Oxides in Heterocycle Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Treatment of CH&#8208;diazomethane sulfonamides with tert&#8208;butyl nitrite produces novel sulfamoyl cyanide N&#8208;oxides which dimerize to form furoxanes. When the reaction is performed in the presence of a dipolarophile, an olefin or an alkyne, dipolar cycloaddition takes place to deliver isoxazolines or isoxazoles, respectively.
The versatility of diazo compounds in organic synthesis &#8211; whose reactivity could be realized in many ways, either with the loss or preservation of the dinitrogen moiety &#8211; continues to attract attention of numerous research teams around the world [1]. The design of each new type of diazo reagent usually opens the whole new area of research rich in novel reactivities discovered and molecular scaffolds synthesized [2].
In 2020, we described for the first time CH&#8208;diazomethane sulfonamides 1 which we showed to be competent synthons for the preparation of pyrazoles 2 (via dipolar cycloaddition with alkynes or &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes)[3] and tetrazoles 3 (via silver&#8208;catalyzed dipolar cycloaddition with arene diazonium salts)[4] (Figure 1).</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Modular Assembly of Electrochemical Flow Microreactor as an Enabling Technology of Electrosynthesis in a Laminar Flow</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flow microreactors are well&#8208;suited for organic electrosynthesis because they provide a large surface area for reactions and enable precise control of the residence time. Here, we developed three novel electrochemical flow microreactors for organic electrosynthesis: undivided, divided, and electrophotochemical reactors. These flow reactors were easily assembled using modules made of solvent&#8208;resistant plastics and feature high interchangeability of each component and the applicability of a reference electrode. We evaluated our reactors on the basis of the redox response of ferrocene and ferrocenemethanol. The results suggested that the reactors maintain laminar flow with both aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes. We applied these reactors to paired electrosynthesis and electrophotocatalysis, demonstrating the utility of these systems for electrosynthesis in a laminar flow.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Liquid Catalyzed C&#8208;C Bond Formation for the Synthesis of Polysubstituted Olefins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polysubstituted olefins as attractive and useful compounds are generally acquired by traditional acid or metal catalyzed system. Herein, a convenient and environmentally friendly method using acidic ionic liquids as a metal&#8208;free catalyst and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as a green solvent has been demonstrated to synthesize polysubstituted olefins through construction of new C&#8208;C bonds by activating of ethers and alkenes. In the system, the usage of metal, halogen, traditional toxic solvents, and a large number of additives was avoided, neutralization after the reaction was not required, and waste production was reduced. The system was suitable for benzyl ethers and styrene derivatives, and recyclable [MeBs(dio)TMP][OTf] exhibited best activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest synergistic functions of the cation and anion of ILs, and also show hydrogen bonds and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions between catalyst and substrates, which can lead to lower barriers.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report the development of a method for the direct Chan&#8211;Lam coupling of arylboronic acid  N  &#8208;methyliminodiacetic acid esters (ArBMIDA). The process accommodates amine and alcohol nucleophiles to deliver a wide range of C&#8211;N and C&#8211;O cross&#8208;coupled products in 34&#8211;99% yield (34 examples). This method serves to expand the scope of organoboron component that can be used directly in this oxidative coupling reaction and provides opportunities for streamlining synthesis.</dc:description>

This method has an extensive substrate scope. The targeted products were easily isolated by filtration in high yields and excellent diastereoselectivities. The reaction also features numerous advantages, including step/atom economy, both catalyst and additive&#8208;free, no organic solvents, simple work&#8208;up, short reaction times, and environmentally friendly conditions. The present strategy utilizes simple conditions, demonstrating the potential application in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and biologically active compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide Conjugated Dihydroazulene/Vinylheptafulvene Photoswitches in Aqueous Environment</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;responsive molecules have seen a major advance in modulating biological functions in recent years. Especially photoswitches are highly attractive building blocks due to the reversible nature of their light&#8208;mediated reactivity. They are frequently used to affect both the properties of small bioactive compounds and biomacromolecules if incorporated suitably. Despite their success in a plethora of applications, only a limited set of photochromic core structures is routinely employed and a large number of photochromic couples are under&#8208;investigated in biological context. Broadening the toolbox of photoswitches available to modulate biological activity would open new avenues and unlock the full potential of photoswitchable molecules for biological studies. In this work, we explore the photochemical and thermal properties of the dihydroazulene/vinylheptafulvene photochromic couple as peptide conjugates in aqueous environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Sulfonamide as Hydrogen Bonding Catalyst in Catalytic Asymmetric Reactions: Concept and Application in the Past Decade</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the first report of bifunctional sulfonamide organocatalysts was launched in 2004, these chiral compounds have proven to be a reliable hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalyst and have been wildly employed in asymmetric organocatalysis due to its strong acidity and self&#8208;aggregation&#8208;free property. Herein, we review the application of bifunctional sulfonamide as hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalyst after 2011, and our highlights will cover asymmetric process including aldol reaction, Michael addition, Mannich reaction, desymmetrization and cyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Rearrangement of Indoles to Spirooxindoles in Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical method for the oxidative rearrangement of indoles to spirooxindoles in employing an undivided, single pass flow cell is reported. The electrochemical reactions require no chemical oxidants and can be scaled up easily without need for re&#8208;optimization of reaction conditions by continuous production with parallel reactors.







Abstract
The oxidative rearrangement of indoles induced by various chemical oxidants is a frequently employed method for the construction of spirooxindole structures. Herein, we report an electrochemical method for the oxidative rearrangement of indoles to spirooxindoles in continuous flow. The electrochemical reactions require no chemical oxidants and can be scaled up easily without need for re&#8208;optimization of reaction conditions by passing more starting material through parallel reactors.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aurantioclavine, isolated by Kozlovskii from Penicillium aurantiovirens, is a unique member of the 3,4&#8208;disubstituted indole alkaloids distinguished by an azepino[5,4,3&#8208;cd]indole. As an essential intermediate in the biosynthesis of the complex polycyclic alkaloids of the fungal communesin, it has attracted considerable attention as a synthetic target. The development of various synthetic strategies for their application in total synthesis has been described. An overview focused on the synthesis of aurantioclavine from its first synthesis to the most recent one is present.</dc:description>

         <title>Deoxygenative&#160;Chlorination of Aldehydes and Alcohols with Dichloromethyl Methyl Ether and TiCl4</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report highly efficient deoxygenative chlorination of aldehydes and alcohols with a dichloromethyl methyl ether and TiCl  4  system. The method converts various aldehydes and alcohols into the desired geminal dichlorides or chlorides with good to excellent yields (up to 99%). Combined with a subsequent Rieche formylation step using the same reagent system, this method provides an efficient approach for synthesis of aromatic dialdehydes. This strategy involves deoxy&#8208;chlorination of the aryl aldehydes followed by a second formylation of more activated benzal chloride derivatives. Dialdehydes can be easily obtained by hydrolyzing the corresponding of dichloromethyl derivative.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Glycogen synthase kinase&#8208;3 &#945;/&#946; is involved in dysregulation of neuronal tau protein in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD). There is an unmet clinical need for a blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) permeable positron emission tomography (PET) probe for imaging of GSK&#8208;3&#945;/&#946; in the brain to understand the pathogenesis of AD. Herein, we synthesized two PET probes, [18F]F&#8208;CNBI and [18F]F&#8208;CNPIFE, and evaluated their BBB permeability and affinity towards GSK&#8208;3&#945;/&#946;. [19F]F&#8208;CNPIFE showed higher in&#8208;vitro binding towards GSK&#8208;3&#945;/&#946; (IC50 = 19.4 &#177; 2.5 nM; n=3, for GSK&#8208;3&#945;, IC50 = 19.4 &#177; 3.8 nM; n=3, for GSK&#8208;3&#946;) compared to [19F]F&#8208;CNBI (IC50 = 107.6 &#177; 26.0 nM; n=4, for GSK&#8208;3&#945;, IC50 = 105.3 &#177; 18.2 nM; n=3, for GSK&#8208;3&#946;). [18F]F&#8208;CNPIFE showed 9.5&#8208;fold higher brain uptake than [18F]F&#8208;CNBI, in normal FVB/NJ mice, which was increased by additional 1.5&#8208;fold on co&#8208;administration of [19F]F&#8208;CNPIFE with respect to [18F]F&#8208;CNBI.

         <title>Colloidosomes as a Protocell Model: Engineering Life&#8208;Like Behaviour through Organic Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bottom&#8208;up synthesis of self&#8208;assembled micro&#8208;compartmentalised systems that mimic basic characteristics of living cells is rapidly evolving. These types of systems are termed &#8220;protocells&#8221; and can be chemically programmed to grow and divide, to send and receive chemical signals, to transcript and translate chemical information, to adhere to surfaces or to other protocells, and to perform rudimental enzyme&#8208;mediated metabolic processes. An emerging protocell model that is attracting great attention is the colloidosome. Colloidosomes are microcapsules with a chemically crosslinked, semipermeable membrane composed of amphiphilic nanoparticles. Colloidosomes display important advantages over other protocell models (e.g., vesicles and coacervate micro&#8208;droplets) due to their physical&#8208;chemical properties that can be easily tuned through the careful engineering of their synthetic building blocks. In this review, we deliver an overview of the different types of colloidosomes that have been developed thus far and discuss how organic chemistry contributes to the design and bottom&#8208;up synthesis of novel types of colloidosomes endowed with advanced chemically programmed bio&#8208;inspired functions.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Generated DBU&#183;HF Acts as a Fluorinating Agent in a Hexafluoroisobutylation Tandem Reaction: An Effective Route to 5,5,5,5&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;Hexafluoroleucine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the direct incorporation of the hexafluoroisobutyl group on a chiral glycine Schiff base complex mediated by 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene (DBU). The fluoroalkylation involves 2&#8208;&#8203;(bromomethyl)&#8203;&#8208;&#8203;1,&#8203;1,&#8203;1,&#8203;3,&#8203;3,&#8203;3&#8208;&#8203;hexafluoropropane reagent, which generates in situ hexafluoroisobutylene (HFIB), and reacts then with the enolate through a tandem allylic shift/hydrofluorination process. We showed that the use of neutral organic base DBU generates in situ an original DBU&#183;HF salt, which preserves the fluoride nucleophilicity and acts as a fluorinating agent. This fluoride salt promotes the hydrofluorination of the pentafluorinated alkene overcoming the usual fluoride &#946;&#8208;elimination observed with &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;vinyl reagents.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report the direct incorporation of the hexafluoroisobutyl group on a chiral glycine Schiff base complex mediated by 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU). The fluoroalkylation involves 2-&#8203;(bromomethyl)&#8203;-&#8203;1,&#8203;1,&#8203;1,&#8203;3,&#8203;3,&#8203;3-&#8203;hexafluoropropane reagent, which generates in situ hexafluoroisobutylene (HFIB), and reacts then with the enolate through a tandem allylic shift/hydrofluorination process. We showed that the use of neutral organic base DBU generates in situ an original DBU&#183;HF salt, which preserves the fluoride nucleophilicity and acts as a fluorinating agent. This fluoride salt promotes the hydrofluorination of the pentafluorinated alkene overcoming the usual fluoride &#946;-elimination observed with &#945;-CF3-vinyl reagents. With alkali metal bases, by contrast, the hydrofluorination is disfavored and the pentafluorinated alkene intermediate is obtained predominantly. This study highlights the critical role of the fluoride counter ion to preserve its nucleophilicity. The protocol is amenable to multidecagram scale synthesis of enantiopure (S)- and (R)-5,5,5,5&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;-hexafluoroleucine and their N-Fmoc or N-Boc derivatives in good overall yield.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C Bond Formation Using Alkenes as Substrates: Insight into Recent Enantioselective Developments</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective mono&#8208; and difunctionalization of alkenes, involving C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C bond formation, are discussed, highlighting the fundamental role of ligands and reaction conditions optimization. This review summarizes the significant advances made over the last years and provides tools for developing new enantioselective transformations.







Abstract
This Review summarizes the advances in the catalytic enantioselective mono&#8208; and difunctionalization of alkenes, highlighting the fundamental role of ligands. Several types of asymmetric reactions have been developed involving different bonds formation, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C, highlighting the urgency to go ahead in the search for new ligands and synthetic methodologies in order to improve the control over the reaction selectivity and activity and thus, to increase the applications in the synthesis of heterocyclic scaffolds and biologically active compounds. The Review is organized into paragraphs, which discuss the type of bond formed during the nucleopalladation, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C bonds, and the type of reaction involved.

The Front Cover illustrates the ability of the squaramide group to remove a chiral anionic ligand from Au(I) by H&#8208;bonding interactions, by analogy with a magnet that attracts a metallic sphere. H&#8208;bonded counterion&#8208;directed catalysis was used to perform an enantioselective tandem cycloisomerization&#8208;nucleophile addition to 2&#8208;alkynyl enones.

In all cases, the  trans  isomer was preferentially obtained. Sensitization and quenching experiments showed that the reaction proceeds via an excited singlet state.

When the obtained  8  was irradiated, the final product  7  was produced. The long wavelength absorption of  6  originates from the 2&#8208;cyanonaphthalene chromophore, indicating that the reaction is initiated by photoexcitation of the naphthalene ring.

         <title>DES&#8208;Type Interactions To Promote Solvent&#8208;Free and Metal&#8208;Free Reactions between Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Heterocycles and Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles are of great interest to organic chemists since they are present in a wide array of bioactive molecules. The use of allylic alcohols to carry out the allylation of heterocycles has been described as a sustainable alternative for this type of functionalization. Among the plethora of methodologies described, the use of metals, solvents, or hazardous reagents is ubiquitous. The protocol described in this work has provided a solventless and metal&#8208;free alternative, being mediated by the easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesise and reusable 1,3&#8208;bis(carboxymethyl)imidazolium chloride. The protocol has resulted compatible with several nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles (i.e. indole, pyrazole, triazole, tetrazole, carbazole, indazole, and benzotriazole) and allylic alcohols, providing the allylated&#8208;heterocycles&#160;with up to quantitative yield, being possible to perform the reaction in preparative scale.Based on various green metrics (atom economy, stoichiometric factor, reaction mass efficiency, materials recovery parameter, E&#8208;factor, and EcoScale), the overall greenness significance of the methodology has been established.</dc:description>

The protocol has resulted compatible with several nitrogen-containing heterocycles (i.e. indole, pyrazole, triazole, tetrazole, carbazole, indazole, and benzotriazole) and allylic alcohols, providing the allylated-heterocycles&#160;with up to quantitative yield, being possible to perform the reaction in preparative scale.Based on various green metrics (atom economy, stoichiometric factor, reaction mass efficiency, materials recovery parameter, E-factor, and EcoScale), the overall greenness significance of the methodology has been established.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;fast continuous&#8208;flow photo&#8208;thiol&#8208;ene reactions on cinchona alkaloids are possible through a fine control of the reactive conformation in solution. Switching the hydroxyl group at C9 by a phenyl carbamate allows thiol&#8208;ene functionalization of cinchona alkaloids in less than 2.5&#8197;minutes with organic thiols at 32&#8201;&#176;C ant under light irradiation at 365&#8197;nm.







Abstract
In this work, we describe ultra&#8208;fast continuous flow photo&#8208;thiol&#8208;ene reactions on cinchona alkaloids derivatives through a control of the reactive conformation in solution. Flow thiol&#8208;ene reactions proceed at 32&#8201;&#176;C under light irradiation at 365&#8197;nm and require only 2.5&#8197;minutes of residence time to reach completion. The short path length of the tubular flow photochemical reactor, which maximizes and homogenizes the photon flux, associated to the fine tuning of the reactive conformation of cinchona alkaloids in solution are the main reasons for the high rates observed. The predominant conformation in solution of cinchona alkaloids was adjusted through the substitution of the hydroxyl group at C9 by a phenyl carbamate function.

         <title>Photochemical Radical Cation Cycloadditions of Aryl Vinyl Ethers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical cation cycloadditions have long been known as unique reactions and yet are intensively studied chemical transformations in the field of modern synthetic organic chemistry. The key to developing new reactions of this class is the generation and control of highly reactive radical cation intermediates. Herein, we report TiO2 photochemical [2 + 2] and [4 + 2] cycloadditions using aryl vinyl ethers as radical cation precursors. The constructions of various four&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings are made possible by these radical cation cycloadditions. Although detailed mechanistic aspects remain unclear, 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene (3) is found to be more radicalophilic than 2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;1&#8208;butene (2) and effectively traps the radical cation of the aryl vinyl ethers to construct six&#8208;membered rings.</dc:description>

         <title>The Journey to Fluorescent Bullvalenes: Pitfalls and Prospects</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A dinaphthoylmethyl&#8208;substituted bullvalene derivative is presented that exhibits excimer fluorescence. It is demonstrated that the fluxional bullvalene core supports the excimer formation of the aroyl substituents, thus offering the opportunity to monitor externally induced structural changes by fluorescence spectroscopy, as exemplarily shown by fluorimetric analysis of host&#8208;guest interactions of the diaroylbullvalene with metal cations, which lead to significant changes of the excimer emission. During the synthesis of the bullvalenes, it was discovered coincidentally that the corresponding triplet&#8208;sensitized photoreaction also yielded three unknown lumibullvalene isomers. The NMR&#8208;spectroscopic analysis of this reaction revealed a sequence and combination of different di&#8208; and tri&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane rearrangements and sigmatropic rearrangements. More importantly, the static lumibullvalenes proved useful as reference compounds for the evaluation of the emission properties of the fluxional bullvalenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Chemistry of Iminoborane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iminoboranes are important unsaturated organoboron compounds with the formula RB&#8801;NR&#8217;. They are isoelectronic with alkynes, yet normally exhibit higher reactivity due to their polarity, thus enabling versatile applications in coordination, synthetic and materials chemistry. This review briefly describes the most recent progress in iminoborane derivatives with the focus of new persistent species and their diverse reactivity, which greatly enrich the iminoborane chemistry. In addition, the promising research directions are also provided.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The hydroxyl&#8208;directed iridium&#8208;catalyzed peri&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bond activation to synthesize substituted pyrano[2,3,4&#8208;de]chromen&#8208;2&#8208;ones and further chalcogenylation under blue light irradiation has been realized efficiently. Most products of polycyclic pyrans and corresponding chalcogenated derivatives with various substituents were achieved in good to excellent yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that this transformation may passes through a five&#8208;membered iridacycle intermediate containing an O&#8208;Ir &#963;&#8208;bond and a photocatalytic free radical process.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Arylacetamides Substituted Maleimide Via Weakly Coordinating Acetamide Assisted Cross&#8208;dehydrogenative Coupling and Their Photophysical Studies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Maleimides serve as an important synthetic precursor for various organic transformation reactions. However, maleimides have been rarely employed as coupling partners for the direct synthesis of 3&#8208;aryl substituted maleimides via oxidative Heck&#8208;type reaction, due to the lack of &#946;&#8722;hydrogen at the syn&#8208;periplanar position. Therefore, herein, we report an efficient and highly selective synthesis of 3&#8208;arylacetamide incorporated maleimides through the cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling process using the simple and native primary acetamide as a weakly directing group with Pd(II)&#8208;catalysis conditions. This reaction furnishes 3&#8208;arylated maleimide derivatives in good yields with high functional group tolerance. Furthermore, 3&#8208;arylated maleimides were transformed into synthetically important derivatives. Based on preliminary control experiments, a probable reaction mechanism has been proposed for the distal C&#8208;H bond functionalization reaction. Interesting photophysical properties of the synthesized products were also observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Directing Groups Used for Metal Catalysed Meta&#8208;C&#8211;H Functionalisation Only Effect Ortho Electrophilic C&#8211;H Borylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two templates used in meta&#8208;directed C&#8211;H functionalisation under metal catalysis do not direct meta C&#8211;H borylation under electrophilic borylation conditions. Using BCl3 only Lewis adduct formation with Lewis basic sites in the template is observed. While combining BBr3 and the template containing an amide linker only led to amide directed ortho C&#8211;H borylation, with no pyridyl directed meta borylation. The amide directed borylation is selective for the ortho borylation of the aniline derived unit in the template, with no ortho borylation of the phenylacetyl ring &#8211; which would also form a six membered boracycle &#8211; observed. In the absence of other aromatics amide directed ortho borylation on to phenylacetyl rings can be achieved. The absence of meta&#8208;borylation using two templates indicates a higher barrier to pyridyl directed meta borylation relative to amide directed ortho borylation, and suggests that bespoke templates for enabling meta&#8208;directed electrophilic borylation may be required.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopropanes are one of the most important strained rings existing in various pharmaceutical products and secondary metabolites. They are also widely used in total synthesis of natural product, medicinal chemistry, and materials science. In the past years, photochemical cyclopropanation has been gradually developed as a robust and attractive synthetic method to prepare diverse cyclopropane backbones. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the visible light&#8208;mediated cyclopropane synthesis, especially in photochemical cyclopropanation using carbene transfer strategy and photocatalytic radical cyclopropanation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Catalyst&#8208;Free Oxidative Synthesis of N&#8208;Formamides from C2&#8208; and C3&#8208;Feedstocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different C2&#8208; and C3&#8208;feedstocks are explored, out of these, 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone (DHA) and glyoxal (GLYOX) as carbon sources provide quantitative yields of N&#8208;formamides at optimal conditions using TBHP as oxidant with minimal carbon loss by applying a carbon source:amine ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;2. This methodology also works well on 5 gram substrate scale producing yields of N&#8208;formanilide product up to 87&#8201;%.







Abstract
The application of bio&#8208;derived feedstocks as building blocks in organic syntheses holds great value with goals of high product yield and minimizing carbon loss. As contribution to this effort, present work explores 5 different C2&#8208; and C3&#8208;feedstocks (derived from biomass and conventional sources) such as glycerol (GLY), 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone (DHA), ethylene glycol (EG), glycolic acid (GLYAC) and glyoxal (GLYOX) as carbon sources for highly selective, catalyst&#8208;free oxidative synthesis of N&#8208;formamides from primary and secondary amines. Both DHA and GLYOX showed the best carbon efficiency through carbon source: amine ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;2, resulting in 100&#8201;% selectivity of N&#8208;formanilide with tert&#8208;butyl hydrogen peroxide (TBHP) as the oxidant. GLYOX was applied further for synthesizing a N&#8208;formamide library of 21 substrates exemplifying substantial yields ranging from 68&#8211;98&#8201;%. Moreover, pilot scalability of this methodology achieved a yield of 87&#8201;% and 72&#8201;% for aniline substrate at 5&#8208;gram scale using GLYOX and DHA respectively in 24&#8197;hours.

         <title>Structures and Applications of NIR&#8208;II AIEgens Containing Benzobisthiadiazole Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>AIEgens fluorescent molecular probes in the NIR&#8208;II window have attracted much attention owning to their deep penetration, reduction of tissue absorption and scattering, excellent photostability, and low cytotoxicity. Among them, as a strong electron&#8208;absorbing group, benzobisthiadiazole skeletons is widely used in the construction of various NIR&#8208;II AIEgens materials. In this review, we concluded AIE nanoprobes bearing a benzobisthiadiazole core in the NIR&#8208;II region. Beginning with a summary of molecular design, recent advances in bioimaging and photodynamic therapy as well as insights and challenges in this thriving field were discussed. We expect that this review will provide perspectives on the potential applications of benzobisthiadiazole&#8208;based NIR&#8208;II AIE nanoprobes in biomedical field and inspire more creative progresses in this research discipline to facilitate the investigation in future clinical translation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An enantioselective organocatalytic reaction of indole&#8208;derived&#8208;1&#8208;azadienes with aldehydes leading the formation of enantioenriched cyclic N,O&#8208;acetals is reported. The corresponding products can be obtained with high levels of stereoselectivity (de &gt; 95%, 65&#8208;99% ee, 8&#8208;98% yield). Furthermore, fused tetracyclic scaffolds can also be obtained by implementing a one&#8208;pot strategy involving an additional oxa&#8208;Michael reaction from aldehydes bearing an a,b&#8208;unsaturated ketone group.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Development and Synthesis of Carbohydrate&#8208;Based Molecules with Promising Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the potential of carbohydrates as starting materials for the synthesis of antimicrobial agents is explored. The most recent and successful reports of sugar&#8208;based bactericides, bacteriostatic agents, and adhesin binders are covered with focus on the methodologies employed in their synthesis, resulting in a useful compilation of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reactions used in carbohydrate modification.







Abstract
With the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), innovation in antibacterial drug research and development is urgently needed and strongly encouraged by the World Health Organization (WHO). Carbohydrates are valuable bioactive scaffolds to be explored in this context, and because of their unique multifunctionality, stereochemical diversity, and natural protein&#8208;binding profile, they come across as attractive starting materials for the synthesis of antimicrobial agents with innovative mechanisms of action (MoA). In this concise review, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methodologies for the synthesis of an array of promising and recently developed carbohydrate&#8208;based molecules with antibacterial activity are presented and discussed. By describing successful case studies as platforms for the scrutiny of carbohydrate modification and coupling approaches in organic chemistry, this work summarizes the latest research efforts in this area, ultimately encouraging the design and synthesis of new and much&#8208;needed glycoantibiotic leads for pharmaceutical development.

         <title>Graphite&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Sulfones in Aqueous Medium</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of mild sustainable protocols for the synthesis of sulfones remains a challenge in organic synthesis. Herein, we report an efficient strategy for the synthesis of sulfones from organic halides and sodium salts of sulfinic acids using graphite powder as reusable catalyst and water as solvent at room temperature. The reaction showed a broad substrate scope, functional group tolerance, easier extraction conditions and the products were isolated without the need of further purification. When &#945;&#8208;halo&#8208;ketones were used as substrate, the corresponding &#946;&#8208;ketosulfones were also obtained in good yields. The method is general and can also be used on larger scale campaigns.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Transition Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of Functionalized Oxindoles and Dihydroquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones Under Microwave Irradiation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A fast transition metal&#8208;free and synthetic methodology for generating a broad scope of highly functionalized oxindoles and dihydroquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones was developed. The exploitation of formamide or N&#8208;methylformamide (reagent/solvent) and potassium persulfate (radical initiator) under microwave irradiation resulted in a fast radical reaction of 10 s. The functionalized oxindoles and dihydroquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones allowed us to readily access several spirocompounds such as spiro[oxindole&#8208;&#611;&#8208;lactones], spiro[oxindole&#8208;&#948;&#8208;lactones], spiro[dihydroquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;one&#8208;&#611;&#8208;lactones], spiro[oxindole&#8208;imides] and spiro[dihydroquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;one&#8208;imides].</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An effective strategy for construction of the 1,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;one scaffolds by a cascade of 1,5&#8208;dienes with cyclobutanone oxime esters was developed. The reaction proceeded through radical addition, 5&#8208;endo cyclization and subsequent deprotonation, in which two new C&#8208;C bonds were formed. This protocol features excellent regioselectivity and low&#8208;cost catalyst, as well as broad substrate scope, which are expected to promote its potential applications in pharmacy and synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlation between Absorption and Substitution of Photochromic 1,2&#8208;Bis(thienyl)ethenes (BTEs) Using Modified Spectroscopic Hammett Equations</title>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a Ni&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization/Negishi&#8208;coupling reaction for the formation of pyrrolidines and pyrrolidinones starting from N&#8208;protected allylamines and acrylamides which contain a redox active ester group. The reaction provides two C&#8208;C bonds in a single operation and takes place with both alkylzinc and arylzinc bromides as nucleophiles. Activation of RAE by low valent Ni complexes involving a radical pathway followed by a fast cyclization of intermediate carbon radicals is proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Glutamyl Dipeptides Catalysed by Mutant E. coli &#947;&#8208;Glutamyltransferases</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#947;&#8208;Glutamyltransferases (GGTs) from different sources have been proposed in recent times as biocatalysts for the enzymatic synthesis of naturally occurring &#947;&#8208;glutamyl derivatives with flavor&#8208;enhancer properties and interesting biological activities. Although the enzymatic approach is considered as a viable alternative to both the troublesome and low&#8208;yielding extraction from natural sources and synthesis through peptide chemistry requiring protection/deprotection steps, yields are not completely satisfactory, due to the intervention of GGT&#8208;catalysed hydrolysis and autotranspeptidation side&#8208;reactions. Here, the design and the use as biocatalyst for preparative purposes of two mutants of  E. coli  GGT are described. The design of mutants was pursued by docking&#8208;guided identification of residues putatively involved in interaction with the acceptor substrate, thus probably representing a first identification of residues constituting the still elusive and poorly characterized acceptor substrate binding site of the enzyme.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein we report a low&#8208;valent cobalt&#8208;catalyzed deprotection of allyloxyarenes. The method displays a broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance, granting its utilization on more complex substrates, including  O  &#8208;allylated derivatives of natural products and drugs. Based on comprehensive experiments a plausible mechanistic pathway for the low&#8208;valent cobalt&#8208;catalyzed  O&#8208;deallylation of allyloxyarenes is proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic and Dynamic Kinetic Resolutions by Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kinetic resolution is one of the most common methods to access enantiomerically enriched compounds. In this method, the resolution is based on the existing difference in reaction rates of the two enantiomers with a chiral catalyst. In the dynamic kinetic resolution, the less reactive enantiomer is racemized and the racemic mixture is further resolved, leading eventually to complete transformation to an enantioenriched compound. This review summarizes the dual catalytic strategies (  i.e.  , modular combinations of distinct catalysts) that have been applied to kinetic resolution and dynamic kinetic resolution. We focus upon the role of the two catalysts, the compatibility between them, and the practical benefits.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Approaches To Design Glycan&#8208;Based Antibacterial Inhibitors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sweet and sticky: This review describes recent advances in the synthesis and application of homo&#8208;and heterovalent glycan&#8208;scaffolds as potential candidates for efficient bacteria lectin inhibition. To study and address the many complex molecular mechanisms involved in multivalent lectin binding events, novel glycoconjugate designs and fine&#8208;tunable glycomaterials have been developed.







Abstract
The interactions between bacterial lectins and carbohydrates on the host cell surface can mediate bacterial adhesion, invasion, and immune evasion. Multivalency plays a key role in these binding events. However, additional molecular mechanisms greatly impact multivalent binding recognition. To develop specific and effective bacterial inhibitors, a deeper understanding of the complex underlying mechanisms of bacterial adhesion processes is necessary. By interfering with bacterial adhesion, synthetic multivalent glycoconjugates do not only have the potential to improve or replace antibiotic treatments, but also represent useful tools to study carbohydrate&#8208;pathogen interactions. In this review, we highlight a few recent advances in the synthesis and application of synthetic glycan&#8208;based scaffolds to uncover the nature of glycan&#8208;bacteria interactions and to design efficient bacterial inhibitors.

         <title>Structure&#8211;Reactivity Relationship of Organozinc and Organozincate Reagents: Key Elements towards Molecular Understanding</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of organozinc reagents is dictated by a subtle choice of reaction conditions such as solvents, additives, and concentration. In this perspective article, some of the key parameters that allow an efficient control of the structure&#8211;activity relationship of organozinc and organozincate reagents in solution are reviewed. The appropriate modeling strategies to address these complex chemical systems are discussed.







Abstract
The main parameters that influence the structure&#8211;reactivity relationship of organozinc and organozincate reagents are gathered in this perspective article. Influences of substituents, inorganic salts, and solvents are discussed and illustrated with examples from the literature. Based on the peculiarities of this chemical system, the perspective is enlarged by molecular modelling considerations to raise the comprehension at the molecular scale of structure&#8211;activity relationships of organozinc and organozincate reagents in solution.

         <title>Recent Developments and Trends in Asymmetric Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric organocatalysis has developed spectacularly over the last decades, and its general importance was recently highlighted by the 2021 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. This Perspective aims at providing a brief historical introduction to this field, as well as discussing selected advanced recent examples underscoring the diversity and potential of this still growing and vibrant field.







Abstract
Asymmetric organocatalysis has experienced a long and spectacular way since the early reports over a century ago by von Liebig, Knoevenagel and Bredig, showing that small (chiral) organic molecules can catalyze (asymmetric) reactions. This was followed by impressive first highly enantioselective reports in the second half of the last century, until the hype initiated in 2000 by the milestone publications of MacMillan and List, which finally culminated in the 2021 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. This short Perspective aims at providing a brief introduction to the field by first looking on the historical development and the more classical methods and concepts, followed by discussing selected advanced recent examples that opened new directions and diversity within this still growing field.

         <title>Palladium/Norbornene co&#8208;Catalyzed Catellani&#8208;Type Domino Reaction with Aryl Diazonium Salts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The palladium/norbornene co&#8208;catalyzed difunctionalization of haloarenes provides a facile and efficient method for the synthesis of polyfunctional aromatic compounds. However, the suitable substrates for such a transformation have been strictly limited to haloarenes. We here demonstrate that aryl diazonium salts could be well employed as substrates in these reactions, enabling arylbromides with electron&#8208;withdrawing group be well used as the cross&#8208;coupling partners.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Anthracene and Pyrene End&#8208;capped Triarylamines for p&#8208;Channel High&#8208;performance OFETs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of new anthracene/pyrene functionalized triarylamine&#8208;based D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8217; semiconductors are demonstrated as  p&#8208;  channel material for high&#8208;performance OFETs. The introduction of electron&#8208;donating end&#8208;caps and ethynyl styrylene bridged spacers at D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8217; architecture modulated the self&#8208;ordering, electron distribution, and field&#8208;effect mobility. These molecules exhibited high&#8208;lying HOMO of ~4.8 eV, enabling the hole&#8208;transporting property and reducing the energy barrier for charge injection. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors fabricated on bottom&#8208;gated top&#8208;contact architecture containing pyrene end&#8208;capped triarylamines with tert&#8208;butyl phenyl sidearm as active layer displayed high hole mobility of 2.5 cm  2  /Vs and on/off current ratio of 10  7  , and the threshold voltage of &#8208;7V. The highest performance was supported by the molecular order of the film, planarity, high HOMO, and electron&#8208;donating nature of the end&#8208;capping units, as illustrated by the SEM, XRD, and DFT studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Weiss Diketone Derivative Bearing Four Phenylsulfanyl Groups</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A bicyclo[3.3.0]octane&#8208;3,7&#8208;dione, bearing four phenylsulfanyl (PhS) groups at the diagonal  &#945;  &#8208;positions of the carbonyls, was synthesized as a key intermediate useful for exploring the regioselective transformations of symmetrical Weiss diketone. Tetra&#8208;PhS&#8208;substituted bicyclo[3.3.0]octane&#8208;3,7&#8208;dione was prepared by deprotonation of the Weiss diketone, using LDA in the presence of PhSSO  2  Ph. The tetra&#8208;PhS&#8208;substituted derivative thus obtained served as a scaffold for further regioselective base&#8208;promoted enolization. Furthermore, the tetra&#8208;PhS&#8208;substituted Weiss diketone underwent an unexpected base&#8208;promoted rearrangement to form isomeric tetra&#8208;PhS&#8208;substituted bicyclo[3.3.0]octane&#8208;3,7&#8208;dione through migration of PhS groups, likely through an interrupted Favorskii rearrangement.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An electrochemical bromination of thiophenes from ammonium bromide is developed both in batch and continuous&#8208;flow conditions. Substituted thiophenes possessing 2&#8208;hydrogens selectively afford a series of 2&#8208;bromothiophenes while 2&#8208;substituted benzothiophenes generate 3&#8208;bromobenzo[b]thiophenes. Based on the cyclic voltammetric studies and literature, a bromine cation involved mechanism was proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208; and Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Deracemization of Allylic Oxygen Compounds with Oxygen Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allylic oxygen compounds (AOCs) are an important class of versatilely applicable building blocks in natural and not natural product synthesis. Catalytic in&#8208;situ deracemization is an attractive means for their enantioselective synthesis. Of particular synthetic interest is the deracemization of AOCs through transition metal&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT) with oxygen nucleophiles (O&#8208;Nus). This review describes pertinent aspects of both the palladium&#8208;catalyzed DYKAT of racemic allylic carboxylates, vinyl oxiranes and vinyl dioxolanones with carboxylates, hydrogen carbonate, alcohols, phenols, oximes and diosphenols and the iridium&#8208;catalyzed DYKAT of allylic alcohols and allylic imidates with alcohols and carboxylic acids. Included in the discussion is the palladium&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of  meso  &#8208;cycloalkene bis(carboxylates) with hydrogen carbonate. Particularly efficient ligands in palladium&#8208;catalyzed DYKAT are Trost&#180;s bisphosphinobenzamides and Zhou&#180;s spiro&#8208;phosphoramidite and in iridium&#8208;catalyzed DYKAT Carreira&#8208;Dorta&#180;s BINOL&#8208;phosphoramidite&#8208;olefin. This review also discusses mechanistic and structural aspects of p&#8208;allylpalladium&#8208;bisphosphinobenzamide and p&#8208;allyliridium&#8208;BINOL&#8208;phosphoramidite&#8208;olefin complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Deoxygenative, Intramolecular Minisci&#8208;Type Reaction to Access Fused Heterocyclic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a straightforward strategy for the synthesis of fused heterocycles through a deoxygenative, intramolecular Minisci&#8208;type reaction. This approach grants access to complex polycyclic scaffolds in three steps from readily available starting materials, such as chlorinated heteroarenes and 1,3&#8208;diols. The use of saccharide derivatives as the starting 1,3&#8208;diol motif allows for the synthesis of novel heterocyclic scaffolds with excellent diastereoselectivity and formal retention of configuration at the newly formed C&#8211;C bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Allenyl Radicals in Organic Synthesis: Challenges and Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allenyl radicals are rarely employed as intermediates for the synthesis of allenes probably owe to the lack of convenient methods for their generation and the high reactivity of short&#8208;lived allenyl radicals. However, strategies take advantage of allenyl radicals are considered as a significant complement to reactions which couldn&#8217;t proceed via an allenyl ionic pathway. As a result, several important methods have been developed in the past decades. Herein, this review is aimed to summarize the recent advance in reactions involving allenyl radicals by highlighting some outstanding challenges and confirming potential areas of improvement, which would offer an inspiration for future studies</dc:description>

         <title>Room Temperature DBN Initiated Phospha&#8208;Brook Rearrangement of &#945;&#8209;Hydroxyphosphonates to Phosphates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of substituted aryl phosphate esters have been synthesised from their &#945;&#8208;hydroxyphosphonates substrates, using DBN (1,5 diazabicyclo(4.3.0)non&#8208;5&#8208;ene) at room temperature, via a phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement. The aryl&#8208;substrate dependence of the rearrangement was explored, and excellent yields of the phosphate esters were achieved irrespective of whether the aryl moiety was activated or unactivated. A plausible mechanism for the rearrangement has been proposed. Based on the low temperature 31P&#8208;NMR, the mechanism of the phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement is proposed to take place via an oxaphosphirane intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of symmetrically&#8208; and unsymmetrically&#8208;substituted cationic diborane(4) compounds with distinct structural motifs and properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of electron&#8208;donating, bridging guanidinate substituents in diborane(4) compounds allows the synthesis of a variety of new cationic diborane(4) compounds. In this work, strategies for the directed synthesis of cationic di&#8208; and tetraboron compounds are presented, leading to the synthesis and complete characterization of several new compounds with distinct structural motifs, all exhibiting B  II  atoms directly bound to each other. Hence, we report on tetracationic donor&#8208;acceptor cyclophanes with diboron donor linkers and organic p&#8208;acceptor units, on paddleweel&#8208;type cationic diboranes, and on unsymmetrically&#8208;substituted monocationic diboranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Mild Photocatalytic Synthesis of Azimines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the photocatalytic formation of azimines upon visible light irradiation of mixtures of sulfonyl azides and electron&#8208;rich azo reagents. The method was applied to a series of alkyl&#8208; and arylsulfonyl azides and azo reagents. The azimines were previously prepared using toxic reagents such as lead&#8208;tetracetate, or harsher UV photons. The reactions can be carried out either in batch or flow conditions. The observation that the azo reagent equilibrates under the reaction conditions and the high energy of the azide triplet state suggests that the reaction may proceed via a photocatalytic cycloaddition, rather than via a nitrene.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Dealkylation of Benzamides in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable, light&#8208;induced N&#8208;dealkylation of tertiary and secondary benzamides bearing primary alkyl substituents at the N&#8208;atom is described. The developed reactions take place in an aqueous environment under mild conditions and do not require the presence of surfactants. They can be carried out not only under irradiation with blue LEDs but also under sunlight.







Abstract
The N&#8208;dealkylation reactions of benzamides occur naturally in living organisms but chemical methods remain poorly developed. So far, light&#8208;induced variants of these processes have been restricted to amides containing secondary N&#8208;alkyl groups or required pre&#8208;functionalization of the starting material. Here, we present a direct, controllable N&#8208;dealkylation of tertiary and secondary benzamides possessing primary alkyl substituents at N&#8208;atom. The developed strategy operates in aqueous environment under mild conditions involving either blue LEDs or sunlight irradiation. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate two&#8208;step oxidation and the intermediacy of radicals at &#945;&#8208;position to N&#8208;atom. Selectivity in N&#8208;dealkylation of homo&#8208; and heterosubstituted tertiary benzamides is also investigated.

         <title>Second Generation Self&#8208;Assembling Dendrimer Combining Supramolecular and Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A second&#8208;generation self&#8208;assembling dendrimer combining supramolecular chemistry and dynamic covalent chemistry has been prepared using orthogonal binding motifs. The first shell is attached by heteroleptic zinc complexes, where the core is carrying bulky substituents. The second sphere is attached by oxime formation.







Abstract
A monodisperse second generation self&#8208;assembled dendrimer has been obtained combining supramolecular chemistry and dynamic covalent chemistry as orthogonal binding moieties. A branching unit 18 and a core 5 were connected via a heteroleptic terpyridine zinc complex exploiting the sterical hindrance of mesitylene units in the 6,6&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;position of one of the terpyridines as the distinction between the ligands. Solubility problems could be solved by introduction of an ethylhexyl ether. The final sphere of the dendrimer was connected via imines, hydrazones and oximes, whereby the oxime made from O&#8208;methylhydroxylamine (22) led to a complete turnover of all aldehyde functions. Furthermore, no amine signal was left and also no signals for a diffusion constant of the hydroxylamine 22 were observed. The successful formation of the dendrimers was analyzed by 1H NMR and DOSY NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore both, the first and second generation dendrimers could be detected by ESI HRMS.

     alt="Second Generation Self-Assembling Dendrimer Combining Supramolecular and Dynamic Covalent Chemistry"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second-generation self-assembling dendrimer combining supramolecular chemistry and dynamic covalent chemistry has been prepared using orthogonal binding motifs. The first shell is attached by heteroleptic zinc complexes, where the core is carrying bulky substituents. The second sphere is attached by oxime formation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A monodisperse second generation self-assembled dendrimer has been obtained combining supramolecular chemistry and dynamic covalent chemistry as orthogonal binding moieties. A branching unit &lt;b&gt;18&lt;/b&gt; and a core &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; were connected via a heteroleptic terpyridine zinc complex exploiting the sterical hindrance of mesitylene units in the 6,6&#8217;&#8217;-position of one of the terpyridines as the distinction between the ligands. Solubility problems could be solved by introduction of an ethylhexyl ether. The final sphere of the dendrimer was connected via imines, hydrazones and oximes, whereby the oxime made from &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methylhydroxylamine (&lt;b&gt;22&lt;/b&gt;) led to a complete turnover of all aldehyde functions. Furthermore, no amine signal was left and also no signals for a diffusion constant of the hydroxylamine &lt;b&gt;22&lt;/b&gt; were observed. The successful formation of the dendrimers was analyzed by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR and DOSY NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore both, the first and second generation dendrimers could be detected by ESI HRMS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Free Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Mizoroki&#8208;Heck Reaction Strategy for the One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Functionalized Oxygen Heterocycles in Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligandless, telescoped, one&#8208;pot reductive Mizoroki&#8208;Heck reactions proceed smoothly and regioselectively in eco&#8208;friendly eutectic mixtures, and under aerobic conditions to yield 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl THF or THP derivatives in up to 95&#8201;% yield. Key intermediates have also been targeted in DES en route to pharmacologically relevant molecules.







Abstract
A Deep Eutectic Solvent, choline chloride/glycerol (1&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;mol&#8201;mol&#8722;1), proved to be an effective and sustainable reaction medium to promote telescoped, one&#8208;pot Mizoroki&#8208;Heck cross&#8208;coupling/reduction processes between 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran or 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran and several (hetero)aryl halides to easily access valuable 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl tetrahydrofuran (THF) or tetrahydropyran derivatives in up to 95&#8201;% yield. Notably, the whole transformation takes place under aerobic conditions, in the absence of additional ligands, and with a good substrate scope. The practicability of the method is also exemplified by the sustainable synthesis of two key THF derivatives, which are side chains of pharmacologically relevant inhibitors of Kv1.2 channel.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;H Alkylation of Glycine Derivatives: A Straightforward Strategy for Diverse &#945;&#8208;Unnatural Amino Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modification of glycine is the one of the most straightforward strategy to access diverse unnatural amino acids. This review outlines an overview of recently developed transformations employing radical&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H alkylation of N&#8208;aryl glycine derivatives.







Abstract
Unnatural amino acids are important scaffolds for novel drug candidates, and especially &#945;&#8208;alkyl amino acids have emerged as a valuable variant. This is due to the ubiquity of alkyl groups, which are pervasive as key motifs in natural products, biological and pharmaceutical molecules. The development of radical&#8208;based approaches in organic synthesis has expanded dramatically in recent years. It has enabled site&#8208; and region&#8208;specific installation of a variety of functionalities in small molecules, which has been spontaneously applied in the preparation of versatile amino acid building blocks. The glycine motif in the backbone of amino acids has gained significant attention for allowing access to a variety of complex &#945;&#8208;unnatural amino acids via radical&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H alkylation. This review summarizes the last decade's development of radical&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H alkylation of glycine derivatives to provide unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acids. The advantages, current limitations, and perspectives of glycine&#8208;based unnatural amino acid synthesis are also discussed.

         <title>Domino Reactions through Recursive Anionic Cascades: The Advantageous Use of Nitronates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The evolving landscape of recursive nitronate cyclization, as a mechanistically distinct domino strategy employing nitroalkanes as dual&#8208;acting one&#8208;carbon lynchpins, is discussed in this review. Its advantageous use in rapid assembly of topologically diverse and functionally embellished carbo&#8208; and heterocycles is highlighted along with their applications in complex natural products synthesis.







Abstract
Recursive Anionic Cyclization (RAC) continues to proliferate as a mechanistically distinct domino strategy. Deployment of nitroalkanes as a source of recursive carbanions has created a niche operating space for generating molecular complexity and diversity. This new corollary i.&#8201;e. recursive nitronate cyclization is the basis of a domino [5&#8197;C+1&#8197;C] cyclization strategy wherein nitroalkanes act as one&#8208;carbon lynchpin, providing rapid access to topologically intriguing, densely functionalized carbo&#8208; and heterocycles embodying multiple chiral centers with regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Extension to aromatic domains, particularly via benzannulation reactions, has further consolidated the operating space. While leveraging the functional versatility of nitro group for post&#8208;domino modifications, such endeavors have culminated in total synthesis of diverse natural products. An incisive analysis of recursive nitronate cyclizations and their emergent potentials is delineated in this review. It is hoped that this focused narrative will enthuse and draw new practitioners to the arena to advance the field.

         <title>Anion Responsive Molecular Switch Based on a Doubly Strapped Calix[4]pyrrole</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chloride, acetate and benzoate anions binding with relatively low affinities are kinetically trapped between the straps within the cavity of a doubly strapped calix[4]pyrrole receptor. The complexation is accompanied by a conformational change of the host reminiscent of an insect being captured in a Venus flytrap.







Abstract
A calix[4]pyrrole receptor bearing two proximally meso&#8208;meso linking isophthaloyl straps displays open and closed states depending on the calix[4]pyrrole conformation. In the crystal structures and in non&#8208;polar solvent, the calix[4]pyrrole adopts open 1,3&#8208;alternate conformation with straps on the sides. Anion binding triggers a closed state of the receptor providing two types of interactions with an aromatic benzoate guest: hydrogen bonds from the pyrrolic NH groups and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions from the phenyl groups of the straps. Slow exchange dynamics was observed on the NMR timescale indicating that benzoate, acetate and chloride anions, which bind with relatively low affinity get kinetically trapped in the receptor as insects in a Venus flytrap.

         <title>Stereoconvergent Synthesis of Cyclopentenyl Nucleosides by Palladium&#8208;Assisted Allylic Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stoichiometric Tsuji&#8208;Trost reaction of cyclopentenyl carbonates proceeds in stereoconvergent manner, selectively leading to cis configured nucleosides, regardless the relative configuration (cis or trans) of the starting substrates. As indicated by DFT calculations, the reaction outcome relies on the low activation energy related to the crucial, Pd&#8208;dependent &#960;&#8208;inversion step. This approach may represent a useful strategy for the synthesis of bioactive carbocyclic nucleosides.







Abstract
The Tsuji&#8208;Trost reaction of cyclopentenyl carbonates was explored by experimental studies and computational calculations, in search for the synthetic conditions enabling the stereoconvergent synthesis of cyclopentenyl nucleosides. Under common conditions, cyclopentenyl reagents provide Tsuji&#8208;Trost products only in a weakly stereoconvergent manner. However, changes in the amount of catalyst (up to 1 eq) affect either the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the reaction, selectively leading to cis configured cyclopentenyl N9&#8208;linked purine nucleosides, regardless the relative configuration (cis or trans) of the starting substrates. DFT studies clarified that this could be due to the low activation energy related to the crucial, Pd&#8208;dependent &#960;&#8208;inversion step.

However, changes in the amount of catalyst (up to 1 eq) affect either the regio- and stereoselectivity of the reaction, selectively leading to &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; configured cyclopentenyl N9-linked purine nucleosides, regardless the relative configuration (&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;) of the starting substrates. DFT studies clarified that this could be due to the low activation energy related to the crucial, Pd-dependent &#960;-inversion step.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydroaminoalkylation of Allenes and Methylenecyclopropanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,2,3&#8208;Trisubstituted cyclopropane products exhibiting a structurally interesting cis&#8208;orientation of all three cyclopropane hydrogen atoms and a 2&#8208;aminoethyl side chain are regio&#8208; and stereoselectively accessible by titanium&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminoalkylation reactions of bicyclic methylenecyclopropanes. In addition, synthetically promising allylamines can be obtained from 1,1&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allenes under comparable reaction conditions.







Abstract
Intermolecular hydroaminoalkylation reactions of 1,1&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allenes as well as methylenecyclopropanes with secondary amines can be achieved in the presence of a 2,6&#8208;bis(phenylamino)pyridinato titanium catalyst at 140&#8201;&#176;C within 2&#8211;8&#8197;h. Corresponding reactions of allenes with N&#8208;benzylanilines deliver branched allylamine products in very good yields (up to 83&#8201;%) and with branched&#8208;linear&#8208;ratios between 75&#8201;:&#8201;25 and 95&#8201;:&#8201;5. In contrast, bicyclic methylenecyclopropanes undergo hydroaminoalkylation with N&#8208;benzylanilines or N&#8208;alkylbenzylamines to give linear products in good to excellent yields (up to 98&#8201;%) with perfect regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The corresponding 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted (2&#8208;aminoethyl)cyclopropane products exhibit a structurally interesting cis&#8208;orientation of all three cyclopropane hydrogen atoms.

         <title>Selective Electrochemical Dibromination of Terpenes and Naturally Derived Olefins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective electrochemical dibromination method of terpenes and naturally derived olefins to functional intermediates has been established using bench&#8208;stable, inexpensive sodium bromide as bromine source at carbon&#8208;based electrodes.







Abstract
A simple electrochemical protocol is established for the selective alkene dibromination of naturally derived olefins, such as terpenes. The use of hazardous Br2 or its analogues have been elegantly avoided by employing readily available, inexpensive, and harmless sodium bromide with a dual role as reagent and supporting electrolyte in combination with sustainable carbon&#8208;based electrodes. This electrochemical protocol provides the desired products with good to excellent yields up to 82&#8201;% with 10 examples. Scalability has been proved by a 5&#8208;fold scale&#8208;up. Notably, higher yields and selectivity were achieved in comparison to conventional bromination by Br2 and DMSO/HBr system and the dibrominated compound was eligible for further functionalization, such as cyanation according to the Kolbe nitrile synthesis protocol.

         <title>20&#960; Antiaromatic Isophlorins without Metallation or Core Modification
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, the synthesis of free&#8208;base (metal&#8208;free) isophlorins with 20&#960; antiaromatic character was achieved without core modification. The reduction of &#946;&#8208;tetracyanoporphyrins by hydrazine under aerobic conditions yielded isophlorins. These 18&#960; aromatic porphyrin/20&#960; antiaromatic isophlorin redox interconversions are reversible.







Abstract
Isophlorins (two&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced porphyrins) with 20&#960; antiaromaticity have been synthesized by metallation or core modification (replacing the inner NHs with less bulky atoms) thus far. The core&#8208;modification number (CMN) is an important factor for the stability of isophlorins against their oxidation to porphyrins. However, isophlorins with small CMN (&#8804;2), i.&#8201;e., without significant core modification, are difficult to synthesize and important for understanding their structure&#8211;antiaromaticity relationships. Herein, we report the synthesis of free&#8208;base (metal&#8208;free) antiaromatic isophlorins with no core modification (CMN=0) for the first time. &#946;&#8208;Tetracyanoporphyrins were successfully reduced by hydrazine to their corresponding isophlorins under aerobic conditions. These porphyrin/isophlorin transformations are reversible. Their structure and antiaromaticity were studied via 1H&#8197;NMR, UV&#8208;vis/near&#8208;infrared absorption spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction and theoretical calculations.

         <title>C&#8722;H Activation Based Functionalization of Furfural Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review summarizes the reported methods of direct C&#8722;H functionalization of furfurals without prior modification of the redox state of the aldehyde function. The aim is to illustrate the different approaches implemented for the functionalization of the C&#8722;H positions of the furan ring as well as of the aldehyde functional group.







Abstract
Furfural and related compounds are building blocks of industrial interest, obtained from raw biomass. Their use as precursors of basic and fine chemicals has gained increasing attention as a green alternative to petroleum&#8208;derived compounds. Several works have reported the functionalization of furfurals to obtain a wider range of chemicals, opening up new synthetic possibilities and applications, ranging from biofuels to pharmaceuticals. Among these works, processes based on C&#8722;H activation are the most attractive ones for their atom economy and the possibility to use non&#8208;activated substrates. This minireview summarizes the reported methods of direct C&#8722;H functionalization of furfurals without prior modification of the redox state of the aldehyde function. In particular, the transition metal catalyzed functionalization of each bond of the heteroaromatic nucleus of these molecules is systematically discussed, as well as examples of C&#8722;H transformations of the aldehyde function.
