         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free tandem carbonyl reduction and hydrodefluorination of b&#8208;trifluoromethyl enones with hydrosilanes was developed for the synthesis of a variety of valuable gem&#8208;difluorovinyl alcohols. The hydrosilane could act as both a reductive agent and a C(sp3)&#8208;F bond&#8208;breaking promotor under mild reaction conditions. Synthetically useful organofluorides, such as gem&#8208;fluorophosphine alkene, gem&#8208;difluorovinyl ketone, and fluorinated dihydrofuran derivatives could be constructed by the further transformations of the obtained gem&#8208;difluorovinyl alcohols. Moreover, the method features operationally simple, excellent functional group tolerance, mild reaction conditions, and scalability.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Noncoded Amino Acids Bearing a Salicylaldehyde Tag for the Design of Reversible&#8208;Covalent Peptides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Insertion of electrophilic species on the structure of small molecule ligands or peptides is a well&#8208;known strategy to increase their binding affinity for the target protein of interest. Among these reactive units, the salicylaldehyde (SA) tag can form remarkably stable imine bonds with the &#949;&#8208;amino group of lysine, a highly frequent residue in proteins. In this work, we describe the optimized synthesis of two new noncoded &#945;&#8208;amino acids, starting from l&#8208;homoserine and featuring the SA tag on the side chain. One of these final compounds was successfully inserted into a model tripeptide through in&#8208;solution synthesis. These building blocks will allow the versatile insertion of the SA tag at suitable position of peptide sequences, opening to a tailored design of Lys&#8208;engaging peptide ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Effects of a Larger N&#8208;Heterocyclic Ring in Rofecoxib Analogues on AIE Activity and Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two AIE&#8208;active analogues, 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF and 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF, with different N&#8208;heterocyclic rings were synthesized. Compound 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF with a larger N&#8208;heterocyclic ring showed an increase in the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) by a factor of around 10 in the solid as well as more multifunctional applications, such as mechanochromism, acidochromism, and lipid droplets imaging ability.







Abstract
Two analogues of rofecoxib, 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF and 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF, were designed according to the strategy of heterocyclic ring enlargement and facilely synthesized in a facile manner by Knoevenagel reactions. The first compound, 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF, had low quantum yields (QY) of 3.0&#8201;% in the solid states. After replacing the pyrrolidinyl with piperidinyl, the resulting 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF had a significantly increased QY, with a value of 28&#8201;%. The root&#8208;mean&#8208;square deviation (RMSD) values between S0 and S1 of 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF and 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF in tetrahydrofuran were 0.51, 0.35&#8197;&#197;, respectively. As compared with 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF, compound 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF exhibited a smaller RMSD, which indicated a lower non&#8208;radiative transition rate. A single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study and Hirshfeld surfaces analysis revealed that 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF had a more nonplanar molecule structure and a weaker &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction, which might result in a higher fluorescence intensity and QY. Owing to its better aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior, compound 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF showed more multi&#8208;functional applications, including mechanochromism, acidochromism, and lipid droplets imaging ability. These results imply that the strategy of heterocyclic ring enlargement provides a new paradigm for the design of new luminogens with AIE properties.

         <title>Exploring the Reactivity of Melanins as Photocatalysts for Reductive Dehalogenations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reductive dehalogenation of &#945;&#8208;halogenated carbonyl compounds has been performed by exploiting four different melanin polymers in the role of photocatalyst. The reaction smoothly took place under visible light irradiation in the presence of sodium ascorbate as an additive. The melanin obtained from 5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole 2&#8208;carboxylic acid offered the best performance, especially in the reduction of brominated substrates.







Abstract
Four melanin polymers prepared from different precursors (5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole, 5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole 2&#8208;carboxylic acid, 1,8&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene and dopamine) have been adopted as photocatalysts in the reductive dehalogenation of a series of model &#945;&#8208;halogen carbonyl derivatives. The best performing melanin was that obtained from 5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole 2&#8208;carboxylic acid, which allowed to dehalogenate efficiently both bromomalonate esters and phenacyl bromide; on the other hand, chloromalonate esters were almost unreactive under the same reaction conditions. Electrochemical and control experiments enabled to elucidate the reaction mechanism, demonstrating the key role of electrons as charge carriers in the observed photocatalytic process.

         <title>Pd&#8208;catalysed indirect and regioselective phosphonation of azobenzenes: toward the design of water&#8208;soluble photoswitches</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient palladium&#8208;catalysed ortho C&#8208;H acyloxylation of azobenzenes, allowing the introduction of the difunctionalised substituent, diethyl phosphonoacetate, is reported. Thanks to the mild reaction conditions implemented, this regioselective late&#8208;stage ortho&#8208;functionalisation tolerates a wide range of functional groups and permits the access of diversely substituted azobenzenes in good to excellent yields. Selective hydrolysis of the diethyl phosphonate group leads to stable water&#8208;soluble azo&#8208;photoswitches with interesting photophysical properties such as an extended Z&#8208;isomer half&#8208;life, opening new opportunities in the design of optochemical tools for the exploration of living organisms.</dc:description>

Visible light mediated tandem oxidation&#8211;organo catalyzed C&#8722;S bond functionalization protocol for the cleavage of aromatic C&#8722;S bond. The investigation encompassed the functionalization of C&#8722;S bonds within sulfones, sulfoxides, and aliphatic sulfide derivatives. However, the process of functionalizing the C&#8722;S bond in aromatic sulfides remains uncertain. The presented protocol demonstrates the C&#8722;S bond functionalization on benzo[b]benzo[4,5]thieno[2,3&#8208;d]thiophene derivative and amines including primary and secondary amines as well.

         <title>Bifunctional Iodoazolium Salts: Searching for Cooperation Between Halogen Bonding and Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 15, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient synthetic route was designed to prepare bifunctional iodoazolium&#8208;based halogen bond (XB) donors bearing varied hydrogen bond (HB) donors. Even though physico&#8208;chemical studies did not show clear evidence for a cooperation between the two non&#8208;covalent interactions, the bifunctional ureido iodoazolium salt proved to be the best activating agent in a Ritter&#8208;type reaction.







Abstract
Non&#8208;covalent interactions play an important role in all sub&#8208;fields of chemistry, including catalysis, where interactions of different natures can work together to improve reactivitiy and selectivity. Several families of molecules that incorporate both hydrogen bond (HB) and halogen bonding (XB) donors have already been studied. However, there is a lack of data on how grafting HB donors to iodoazolium salts could impact their association and reactivity properties. Herein, we disclose the synthesis of a library of iodoazolium salts bearing varied HB donors, along with a study of their physico&#8208;chemical properties using different techniques (X&#8208;ray diffraction, 31P&#8197;NMR, ITC) and their behavior in catalysis. Even though no clear&#8208;cut evidence of cooperation between XB and HB could be obtained through physico&#8208;chemical evaluations, a iodoazolium salt bearing a urea function displayed better conversion and product selectivity in a Ritter reaction than all other activators lacking one or the other function.

         <title>Synthesis of Artemisinin G from Artemisinin via Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 15, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoredox catalysis has become a mainstay in synthetic methodology over the past decade. Herein, an efficient method for the synthesis of artemisinin G from artemisinin by using 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% of TBADT as the catalyst was reported. The reaction proceeds smoothly and rapidly (complete within 30&#8197;min) at room temperature in high yield.







Abstract
Photoredox catalysis has become a mainstay in synthetic methodology over the past decade. However, its application in the functionalization of natural products remains to be further explored. Herein, we report an efficient approach to synthesize artemisinin G from artemisinin via photocatalysis in high yield.

         <title>A Green Approach to Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitutions of Nicotinic Esters in Cyrene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 15, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green choice: Cyrene has been used as an eco&#8208;friendly alternative to environmentally harmful polar aprotic solvents in SNAr reactions. This innovative protocol enabled the facile synthesis of a wide library of novel nicotinic esters, valuable precursors of bioactive compounds. This methodology could also be extended to scale&#8208;up processes, microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis, and one&#8208;pot telescoping reactions, thus enhancing its applicability in various eco&#8208;friendly synthetic contexts.







Abstract
The green solvent CyreneTM has emerged as a valuable substitute for conventional polar aprotic organic solvents such as DMF, DMSO and NMP (renowned for their toxicity and environmental concerns). However, in the presence of bases, Cyrene is prone to polymerization, thus potentially incompatible with reactions where a base is needed to generate reactive nucleophiles. In this study, we developed an efficient synthetic strategy for nucleophilic aromatic substitutions of nicotinic esters in Cyrene. The success of this protocol relies on a very short reaction time (only 15 minutes) which prevents polymerization from occurring. Indeed, Cyrene not only outperformed typical solvents such as DMF and DMSO, but also, being highly soluble in water, allowed an easy purification of the desired products by simple precipitation upon the addition of ice&#8208;water.

         <title>Uranyl&#8208;Organic Framework as Hydrogen Atom Transfer Catalyst for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Heterogeneous Hydroacylation of Azodicarboxylates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 15, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A uranyl&#8208;organic framework with a 2D structure has been synthesized, which exhibits excellent catalytic activity for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven heterogeneous hydroacylation of azodicarboxylates. The yields of the desired products were up to 99%, and the catalyst could be recycled 7 times without a significant decrease in activity.







Abstract
The direct C&#8722;H to C&#8722;N bond conversion at room temperature using heterogeneous visible&#8208;light catalysts is both interesting and challenging. Herein, we disclosed visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted hydroacylation of azodicarboxylates using uranyl&#8208;organic framework [UO2(OH)(cpt)]n (Ucpt, Hcpt=4&#8208;(4&#8242;&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole) as an efficient heterogeneous hydrogen atom transfer photocatalyst. In this procedure, diverse benzaldehydes are compatible using dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as a green solvent at room temperature, achieving direct conversion of C&#8722;H to C&#8722;N bond with excellent yields (up to 99%). The key to excellent catalytic activity lies in the fact that the coordination of the conjugated ligand changes the HOMO energy level of Ucpt, resulting in more active sites and longer&#8208;lived photo excitons. Simultaneously, this heterogeneous photocatalyst can be easily separated and reused for seven successive cycles and maintain high catalytic activity, showing outstanding sustainability and recyclability.

&lt;p&gt;A uranyl-organic framework with a 2D structure has been synthesized, which exhibits excellent catalytic activity for visible-light-driven heterogeneous hydroacylation of azodicarboxylates. The yields of the desired products were up to 99%, and the catalyst could be recycled 7 times without a significant decrease in activity.

         <dc:description>
Asymmetric Michael addition of 4&#8208;monosubstituted&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones to simple enones is realized on capitalization of iminium activation mode of organocatalyst. The pyrazolone derivatives featuring vicinal all carbon quaternary and tertiary stereocenters, were obtained in good to excellent stereoselectivities.







Abstract
Pyrazolone moiety bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereogenic center is frequent in biologically active products and pharmaceuticals. The catalytic route for the construction of quaternary carbon centers poses a formidable challenge . In this report, catalytic asymmetric Michael addition of 4&#8208;monosubstituted&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones to simple enones catalyzed by primary amine&#8208;Br&#248;nsted acid composite has been developed. An array of pyrazolone derivatives bearing vicinal all carbon quaternary and tertiary stereocenters, were obtained in moderate to good diastereoselectivities (up to 92&#8201;:&#8201;8 dr) and good to excellent enantiomeric excess (up to 99&#8201;% ee). In addition, antipode for enantiomers of the pyrazolone derivatives were also realized in good to high stereoselectivities (up to 92&#8201;:&#8201;8 dr and up to 98&#8201;% ee).

         <title>Tf2O&#8208;Promoted Synthesis of Ureas, Carbamates and Thiocarbamate via Lossen Rearrangement: A Mechanistic Insight</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 15, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new and feasible synthetic method for ureas, carbamates and thiocarbamate from hydroxamic acid and Tf2O via Lossen rearrangement has been developed. The use of Tf2O was chemoselective with hydroxamate group with broad substrate applicability and good functional group tolerance. Further pathway of the mechanism was analysed through computational studies.







Abstract
Herein, we report triflic anhydride mediated synthesis of ureas starting from hydroxamic acids. The scope of triflic anhydride was also expanded to encompass carbamates. In addition, this reaction is applicable to activation of hydroxamic acid derivative of dipeptide giving &#945;&#8208;uriedopeptidomimetics in good yield. The mechanistic study of reaction was carried out by DFT. This study is important because it demonstrates that Tf2O has the potential to be effective when used on a substrate that possesses amide bond. A broad substrate scope and mild conditions render this protocol a promising approach to the synthesis of diverse types of ureas.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Cinnamylamines Via the Heck Reaction: Application in the Synthesis of Abamine, Naftifine and Reboxetine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 15, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both cinnamylamines and their saturated counterparts are important pharmacophores in medicinal Chemistry. A new Heck protocol has been developed that uses as little as 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% Pd and following Boc deprotection and salt formation, pure trans&#8208;cinnamylamines may be isolated at gram scale without need for chromatography. The methodology was applied to chromatography free syntheses of three pharmaceutically important molecules.







Abstract
Following an extensive screening of reaction parameters such as the nature and amount of bases, Pd pre&#8208;catalysts, ligands, additives, solvents and temperature range, we succeeded in developing a Heck reaction using N&#8208;Boc&#8208;allylamine and commercially available aryl bromides, capable of delivering a wide range of Boc&#8208;protected trans&#8208;cinnamylamines with 75&#8211;85&#8201;% regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity over other isomers. Optimisation of the Boc&#8208;deprotection step and its work&#8208;up procedure allowed for all minor isomers and impurities to be purged thus isolating pure trans&#8208;cinnamylamines typically in 55&#8211;65&#8201;% yield without need for chromatography. We have successfully performed this chemistry in up to 5&#8197;g scale and demonstrated its usefulness by applying it to the synthesis of abamine, naftifine hydrochloride and a formal synthesis reboxetine mesylate.

         <title>On the Substrate Scope of Dimethylsulfonium Propionate Lyases toward Dimethylsulfoxonium Propionate Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 15, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six DMSP lyases were investigated for their potential to cleave synthetic DMSOP analogs with longer alkyl chains into sulfoxides and acrylate. The pH dependency and enzyme kinetics of these reactions were determined, showing efficient transformation by four of the studied DMSP lyases.







Abstract
The six dimethylsulfonium propionate (DMSP) lyases DddQ, DddW, DddP, DddY, DddK and DddL catalyze the elimination of dimethyl sulfide from DMSP and can also cleave the marine metabolite dimethylsulfoxonium propionate (DMSOP) to DMSO and acrylate. In this study the potency of all six enzymes for the conversion of four DMSOP analogs with longer alkyl chains that were synthesized in three steps from 3&#8208;mercaptopropionic acid was investigated. For this purpose, the pH dependency of the enzyme reactions was determined, showing optimal conditions at pH&#8197;8 for all enzymes but DddP, for which an optimum of pH&#8197;6 was found. Efficient transformations were observed for DddQ, DddW, DddY and DddK, for which the Michaelis&#8208;Menten kinetics were determined for all four substrate analogs. HPLC analysis of the dialkylsulfoxides obtained with the most efficient enzyme DddW revealed that these compounds were obtained with a low to moderate enantiomeric excess (up to 25&#8201;% ee), demonstrating that this enzyme has a preference for one of the enantiomers of the DMSOP analogs.

         <title>Direct Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction of Biomass&#8208;Derived Furfurol with Maleimides in a Bio&#8208;Based Green Solvent</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 15, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The upconversion of biomass&#8208;derived furfurol through a direct Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with maleimides in 2&#8208;Me&#8208;THF enabled the construction of various heterocyclic compounds, while switching the reaction selectivity depending on the temperature.







Abstract
Environmental concern has motivated an inclination to exploit waste and upgrade it into high&#8208;added&#8208;value chemicals. Biomass is an excellent carbon source that provides a variety of raw materials as building blocks, such as furans. Herein, we report the upcycling of furfurol, a known biomass by&#8208;product, through a Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition with maleimides that is performed in a green bio&#8208;derived solvent, 2&#8208;MeTHF. We provide two alternative sets of reaction conditions to promote exo or endo selectivity, which depends on the temperature employed. A variety of products were obtained in 70&#8211;96&#8201;% yield and high exo selectivity at 80&#8201;&#176;C, while a 30&#8201;:&#8201;70&#8208;45&#8201;:&#8201;55 exo/endo ratio was produced at room temperature. A large&#8208;scale reaction was also performed.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;free Chloroamination Cyclization Cascade with Sodium Hypochlorite: from N&#8209;(Pentenyl)sulfonylamides to 2&#8209;(1&#8208;Chloromethyl)pyrrolidines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A mild and catalyst&#8208;free protocol to obtain several 2&#8208;chloromethylpyrrolidines by the use of a commercial solution of sodium hypochlorite is here reported, without the need for a light source. The choice of the solvent revealed to be crucial in the success of the reaction. Mechanistic studies, both experimental and computational, confirmed a radical mechanism, where the deprotonation step, followed by the oxidation of a N&#8208;centered anion to the corresponding radical, allowed 2&#8208;chloromethylpyrrolidines, by a very fast cyclization, to be obtained. Sodium hypochlorite plays the role of both the oxidant and the chlorine source.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationships of Glucose&#8208;based PdII&#8208;Bis(NHC) Complexes in a Model Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The authors of this work have optimized a novel synthetic route towards glucose&#8208;based PdII&#8208;bis(NHC) complexes in only 4 steps with total yields up to 73&#160;%. The synthesis route encompasses an Appel reaction towards 6&#8208;iodo&#8208;glucopyranosides, followed by acyl&#8208;protection, then quaternization with imidazoles and finally the conversion of these acyl&#8208;protected glucosyl imidazolium salts to their respective palladium(II)bis(NHC) complexes, via an intermediary silver(I) complex. Overall, 11 acyl&#8208;protected glucosyl imidazolium iodides as NHC&#8208;precursors and 15 complexes have been synthesized. The structure&#8208;activity relationships of different functionalizations in these complexes and their reactivity in a model Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura between bromobenzene and 4&#8208;tolueneboronic acid reaction has been investigated, and a highly reactive complex leading to &gt;99&#160;% yield at 0.005&#160;mol% catalytic loading has been found.</dc:description>

         <title>SO2F2&#8208;Mediated Thioesterification of Carboxylic Acids with Thiols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article described the thioesterification of carboxylic acids with thiols through the activation of sulfonyl fluoride (SO2F2). The presented one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step protocol was compatible with aryl/alkyl carboxylic acid including drug molecules.







Abstract
The generation of thioesters through thioesterification of carboxylic acid has significant synthetic value given the easy availability of various carboxylic acids and the extensive application of thioesters. An economical and rapid thioester synthesis approach is still needed. Herein, we achieved thioesterification of carboxylic acids with valuable glycosyl thiol, aromatic and aliphatic thiols mediated by sulfonyl fluoride (SO2F2). The compatibility of numerous carboxylic acid substrates was tested, including (hetero)aromatic and aliphatic carboxylic acids and the reaction proceeded smoothly under mild conditions at good yields. Late&#8208;stage modification of drug molecules rac&#8208;Naproxen and Loxoprofen proved feasible. Besides, the gram&#8208;scale reaction demonstrated the utility of this protocol.

         <title>Synthesis and Application of Well&#8208;Defined Fluoroalkyl Zinc Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluoroalkyl groups play an irreplaceable role in the field of pharmaceutical and agrochemical industry due to their unique properties. Based on this, it is crucial to effectively introduce fluoroalkyl groups into target molecules. In this review, we describe the synthesis of well&#8208;defined fluoroalkyl zinc complexes and their applications in the fluoroalkylation of compounds. Different from the reactivities of copper fluoroalkyl complexes, fluoroalkyl zinc complexes often needed to be combined with copper or nickel catalysts when participating in fluoroalkylation reactions. From the perspective of reaction mechanism, the transfer of trifluoromethyl from zinc complexes to copper catalysts formed the highly active trifluoromethyl copper reagents, which can be directly used for the fluoroalkylation. In most cases, the desired target products were provided with excellent yields.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigations were made on the chemoselectivity in superbase&#8208;mediated reactions of N&#8208;tosylhydrazones with aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide precursors. Under super basic conditions, the reaction of N&#8208;tosylhydrazone with ortho&#8208;aminobenzyl afforded 2&#8208;substituted quinoline while the reaction of former with N&#8208;(2&#8208;(chloromethyl)phenyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylbenzenesulfonamide furnished azine sulphonamides.







Abstract
We have encountered a superbase&#8208;mediated chemoselective reaction of N&#8208;tosylhydrazones with aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide precursors. When tosylhydrazone was treated with ortho&#8208;aminobenzyl alcohol in super basic conditions (KOH+DMSO), we observed the formation of 2&#8208;substituted quinoline. The reaction was found to be general, and by this method, mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted quinolines could be made. We could prove experimentally and theoretically that the reaction proceeded via the formation of an azine from the basic decomposition of N&#8208;tosylhydrazones. Finally, the reaction of tosylhydrazone with N&#8208;(2&#8208;(chloromethyl)phenyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylbenzenesulfonamide (aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide precursor) under super basic conditions afforded hydrazine substituted sulfonamides.

&lt;p&gt;Investigations were made on the chemoselectivity in superbase-mediated reactions of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-tosylhydrazones with aza-&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-quinone methide precursors. Under super basic conditions, the reaction of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-tosylhydrazone with &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-aminobenzyl afforded 2-substituted quinoline while the reaction of former with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(2-(chloromethyl)phenyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide furnished azine sulphonamides.

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed One&#8208;Pot Multi&#8208;Step Synthesis of N&#8208;Polyheterocycles from Nitroarenes and Glycols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem process for the synthesis of N&#8208;polyheterocycles from easily available nitroarenes catalyzed by a dioxomolybdenum(VI) complex is described, where the byproduct generated in the first step is incorporated into the final structure. A broad variety of nitrogenated compounds are synthesized in overall good yields in a one&#8208;pot manner.







Abstract
We report the efficient, sustainable one&#8208;pot synthesis of a wide variety of N&#8208;polyheterocycles, such as imidazo&#8208;quinolines and quinoxalines, and furoquinolines, from easily available nitroaromatics and glycols via a molybdenum catalytic domino reduction&#8208;imine formation&#8208;intramolecular cyclization&#8208;oxidation sequence. It is worth highlighting that the recycling and incorporation of the waste carbonyl byproduct, generated in the reduction step, into the final compound is realized. In addition, the overall efficiency and atom economy of the process are further improved owing to the participation of one reaction intermediate as reductant that allows lowering the amount of external reducing agent employed.

         <dc:description>
A transition metal&#8208;free synthesis, involving C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond formations, was employed in a multicomponent protocol to create novel highly substituted 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;[N&#8208;(alkyl/aryl/heteroaryl)&#8208;3&#8208;oxoisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;yl]&#8208;1H&#8208;indene&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;diones. Utilizing a unique combination of phase transfer catalysis and a multi&#8208;component strategy, a total of 26 compounds were successfully synthesized in this study.







Abstract
A facile technique was demonstrated for the synthesis of 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;[N&#8208;(alkyl/aryl/heteroaryl)&#8208;3&#8208;oxoisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;yl]&#8208;1H&#8208;indene&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;diones by using a metal&#8208; free persulfate&#8208;mediated one pot three&#8208;component reaction. The reaction involved the combination effect of TBAB (PTC) and K2S2O8 with the addition of the amine to phthalaldehyde and 2,2&#8208;dihydroxyindane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione to generate isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;one in&#8208;situ, followed by cyclization.This lactamization process facilitated the formation of C&#8722;N bonds under controllable and ambient reaction conditions. A variety of 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;[N&#8208;(substituted)&#8208;3&#8208;oxoisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;yl]&#8208;1H&#8208;indene&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;diones were successfully synthesized through a radical pathway from isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;one, involving C&#8722;C bond formation. The method demonstrated high functional group compatibility and a wide substrate scope, resulting in moderate to good yields of the desired products. Additionally, the mechanistic analyses demonstrated that isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;one might be a significant intermediate being involved in the reaction. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis was used to examine the crystal structures of synthesized 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;[N&#8208;(substituted)&#8208;3&#8208;oxoisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;yl]&#8208;1H&#8208;indene&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;diones. Furthermore, it seems that the reaction mechanism involves a radical pathway.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Reactions of Alkenes with C&#8211;C Bond Formation: Recent Developments</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkenes are highly valuable materials in organic synthesis, and their three&#8208;component reactions offer a promising method for C&#8208;C bond formation and carbon chain elongation. This approach not only reduces the number of reaction steps but also minimizes waste generation, enabling the preparation of polysubstituted alkanes from simple starting materials. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advancements in this field from 2013 to 2023. We have classified the developments into three main categories: (1) reactions triggered by C&#8208;radicals or heteroatom&#8208;radicals; (2) cascades involving three&#8208;membered ring intermediates; and (3) transformations catalyzed by metals. We will discuss a wide range of reactions that involve diazoium salts, arylhydrazines, acids, aldehydes, 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls, diazo compounds, amines, malononitriles, diacyl peroxides, ethers, 1,3&#8208;dithiane, arenes, CuSCF3, selectfluor, Et3N&#8226;3HF, TBHP, CH2Cl2, CHCl3, CO2, CO, KCl, H2O, and other reagents. These reactions lead to alkylation, arylation, or carbonylation products. We believe that this review will be helpful for future research in this area.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorene and Fluorenone Unnatural Amino Acid Motifs via Diastereoselective Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed sp3 C&#8208;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper reports the construction of racemic and enantiopure (D&#8208; and L&#8208;) fluorene and fluorenone&#8208;based novel unnatural amino acid derivatives. The Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed bidentate directing group&#8208;aided arylation of prochiral &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds in racemic, enantiopure carboxamides of amino acids with iodofluorenes was reported. The construction of novel examples of fluorene and fluorenone motifs containing amino acids comprising of norvaline, leucine, phenylalanine, norleucine, 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid derivatives having the anti&#8208;stereochemistry (with good enantiopurity) was accomplished. The construction of bis fluorenyl alanine scaffolds and fluorenyl motif&#8208;containing non&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid (aminoalkanoic acid) derivatives was also reported. Examples of removal of the directing group (8&#8208;aminoquinoline) and phthalimide&#8208;protecting group present in the fluorenyl&#8208;based unnatural amino acid derivatives have been shown. Accordingly, fluorene motif&#8208;based amino acid esters and free amino group&#8208;containing unnatural amino acid derivatives were synthesized. The stereochemistry of the major (anti) diastereomers obtained via the prochiral &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H arylation of norvaline, leucine, phenylalanine, norleucine, 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid derivatives was ascertained from the X&#8208;ray structure of a representative compound. Fluorene&#8208; and fluorenone&#8208;based motifs are vital skeletons in materials and medicinal chemistry research. Accordingly, this work is a contribution towards enriching the library of fluorene and fluorenone unnatural amino acid scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Sterically Hindered &#945;&#8208;Allyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Aryl Lactams via Palladium&#8208;Catalysed Decarboxylative Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation</title>

         <dc:description>The Pd&#8208;catalysed decarboxylative asymmetric allylic alkylation (DAAA) of sterically hindered &#945;&#8208;aryl,&#946;&#8208;amido allyl ester lactams has been developed. The key step in the synthesis of a range of &#945;&#8208;aryl lactam substrates for catalysis was a Pb&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;arylation of a &#946;&#8208;amido allyl ester affording 14 novel examples of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amido allyl ester lactams in good yields (up to 80 %). The Pd&#8208;catalysed DAAA was optimised with the 2,4,6&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl&#8208;containing substrate. Using (S,S)&#8208;DACH&#8208;phenyl Trost as the optimal chiral ligand, enantioselectivities of up to 82 % ee were obtained. A substrate scope of 11 examples of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amido allyl ester lactams showed that products containing the di&#8208;ortho&#8208;methoxy&#8208;substituted phenyls and naphthyl groups gave rise to the highest ees, whereas products not bearing this substitution pattern showed lower enantioselectivities (&lt; 60 % ee). Transition states to rationalise the observed stereochemical outcome are proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Induced Trifluoromethylation/Cyclization of Unactivated Alkene&#8208;Bound Quinazolinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trifluoromethylation cyclization of unactivated alkenes attached to quinazolinone scaffolds is demonstrated under visible light photocatalysis using readily available and inexpensive trifluoroacetic acid and anhydride, without the need for strong oxidants. A wide substrate range and cyclization to 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered rings has been demonstrated in 44&#8211;82&#8201;% yields.







Abstract
Herein, we reported a selective, mild method for the visible&#8208;light&#8208;photocatalyzed trifluoromethylation and cyclization of unactivated tethered alkenes to provide tri&#8208; and tetracyclic quinazolinones. Trifluoroacetic acid and anhydride are inexpensive and readily available reagents for the process that proceeds without the addition of a strong oxidant. The wide substrate scope and the formation of 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered rings are demonstrated in 44&#8211;82&#8201;% yields. Control experiments provide the basis for a proposed mechanism involving photocatalyzed SET from fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 to TFAA and trifluoromethyl radical&#8208;mediated regioselective cyclization. The practicality of the protocol was illustrated by a gram&#8208;scale synthesis in 76&#8201;% yield.

         <title>Application of the Photo&#8208;Fries Reaction as a Key Step in the Preparation of Valuable Aryloxyethyl Selenocyanates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A multi&#8208;step sequence leads to the preparation of a series of aryl selenocyanate WC&#8208;9 homologues which are interesting compounds with potential biological activity against Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. The synthetic sequence involves the application of the photo&#8208;Fries rearrangement reaction as a key step for the preparation of a series of 2&#8208;hydroxyphenones bearing alkyl chains of different length and a phenyl group. These intermediates are obtained upon direct irradiation (254 nm) of 4&#8208;phenoxyphenyl esters in different solvents at room temperature. Then, reaction of the 2&#8208;hydroxyphenones with 2&#8208;(2&#8208;bromoethoxy)tetrahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran followed by acid deprotection, tosylation (or mesylation) reaction and, finally, nucleophilic attack with potassium selenocyanate provides the target aryloxyethyl selenocyanate homologues in good yields.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a series of novel ferrocenyl/phenyl/thiophenyl&#8208;azoles was disclosed by vinylic amination of ferrocenyl/phenyl/thiophenyl substituted &#946;&#8208;chloro cinnamaldehydes and acrylonitriles. A highly economical and robust chalcogen&#8208;stabilized iron selenide carbonyl cluster Fe3Se2(CO)9 worked as an efficient catalyst under aerobic conditions. The amination of ferrocenyl/phenyl/thiophenyl substituted &#946;&#8208;chloro&#8208;vinylic Csp2&#8208;Cl with azole derivatives was fully established and fabrication of the Csp2&#8208;N bond was completely supported by various spectral analysis. Moreover, wide range of substrates with functionally different azoles were investigated for the present reaction and good to excellent transformation was recorded. Some of the selected ferrocenated azole derivatives were screened for anti&#8208;cancer activity against the prostate cancer cells (PC&#8208;3) and found to be highly active at low concentration of 5.77&#181;M with IC50 value. Furthermore, HOMO and LUMO levels and energy gap of some selected compounds were calculated by the density functional theory (DFT).</dc:description>

         <title>New Avenues for the Synthesis of Oxa&#8208;Cycles Using Lewis/Br&#248;nsted Acid mediated Carboxygenation and Carboalkoxylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cascade functionalizations of alkynes have provided many elegant methods for the synthesis of useful scaffolds. Amongst these functionalizations, the ones comprising C&#8208;C and C&#8208;O bond formation have been utilized extensively due to the abundant presence of oxygenated motifs in various bio&#8208;active natural as well as unnatural products. Transition&#8208;metal catalysis is a mainstay for these tandem functionalizations as they are very efficient. However, their utilization does typically involve stoichiometric additives like other metal salts and/or Lewis acids/Br&#248;nsted acids (LA/BA). Thus, approaches that rely solely on using LA/BA, make these vital transformations not only eco&#8208;friendly and atom economical but also cost beneficial are fast emerging as complementary alternatives. The present review addresses the gap in the literature by summarizing recent developments in LA/BA mediated 1,1/1,2&#8208;carboxygenation and carboalkoxylation of alkynes for the synthesis of oxa&#8208;cycles. The reaction mechanisms are particularly emphasized to bring out understanding needed from the point of future developments in this domain.</dc:description>

Thus, approaches that rely solely on using LA/BA, make these vital transformations not only eco-friendly and atom economical but also cost beneficial are fast emerging as complementary alternatives. The present review addresses the gap in the literature by summarizing recent developments in LA/BA mediated 1,1/1,2-carboxygenation and carboalkoxylation of alkynes for the synthesis of oxa-cycles. The reaction mechanisms are particularly emphasized to bring out understanding needed from the point of future developments in this domain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Introduction of an Acetyl Group at the &#945;&#8208;Carbon Atom of an Arene Ring through an Amide Photo&#8208;Fries Rearrangement upon Exposure to UV Light</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We employed amide photo&#8208;Fries rearrangement for the synthesis benzoheterocyclic compounds and found that a direct acylation of &#945;&#8208;carbon in an arene ring can occur upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. In this reaction, the N&#8208;acetyl group of amides underwent rearranged to the &#945;&#8208;position cross the bridgehead carbon to the other side of the carbon under UV&#8208;C light. The reaction conditions were gentle and secure. Moreover, this reaction proves to be more convenient for selectively manipulating benzoheterocyclic compounds in comparison to traditional approaches involving Lewis acid catalysts or anionic reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Promoted Desulfurative Cleavage of Cyclopropylmethyl Thioethers and Amination of the Formed Cyclopropylcarbinyl Cations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclopropylmethyl sulfides react with N&#8208;fluorosulfonimide (NFSI) or molecular iodine, enabling C&#8722;S cleavage to generate cyclopropylcarbinyl cations, which evolve through cyclopropane ring&#8208;opening reactions into homoallyl cations suitable to react with nucleophiles present in the reaction media. This desulfurative cleavage of cyclopropylmethyl thioethers under non&#8208;acidic conditions facilitates homoallylation of N&#8208;based nucleophiles such as alkyl or aryl amines as well as sulfonimides through a one&#8208;pot protocol in one or two steps depending of the nucleophile.

         <title>Selective Synthesis of Functionalized 3(2H)&#8208;Furanones via Tandem Michael Addition/Rearrangement/Cyclization Reaction of Aliphatic Alkynones: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel base&#8208;catalyzed dimerization pathway of widely&#8208;applicable substrates, namely alkynones, is discovered. The key role of catalyst and solvent on the reaction chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity is experimentally revealed and further rationalized through density functional theory study of possible reaction mechanism including ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and quantum theory of atoms in molecules analysis of various substrate/catalyst/solvent complexes.







Abstract
A novel catalyst&#8208; and solvent&#8208;controlled dimerization of aliphatic alkynones through tandem Michael addition/rearrangement/cyclization sequence has been developed. The elaborated protocol provides a convenient chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective access to rare 3(2H)&#8208;furanones decorated with 2&#8208;exo&#8208;methylene and 4&#8208;ethenyl functionalities. A comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) study of possible reaction mechanism including ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis of various substrate/catalyst/solvent complexes has revealed the Janus&#8208;like behavior of the employed sodium tert&#8208;butoxide/toluene system that is responsible both for the chemoselectivity of the initial addition step and the inhibition of the final cyclization step.

         <title>Molecular Networking&#8208;Guided Discovery of Kyonggic Acids in Massilia spp.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metabolomes of six Massilia strains were analyzed using a molecular&#8208;networking guided approach, revealing interconnections among metabolites. A closer inspection of the most promising strains led to the discovery of novel N&#8208;acylated amino acids, termed kyonggic acids. Additionally, cluster analysis also unveiled previously described metabolites such as massiliachelin and its biosynthetic shunt products.







Abstract
In recent years, bacteria of the genus Massilia have been identified as promising sources of bioactive natural products. In this study, we used mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based molecular networking for the first comprehensive analysis of the secondary metabolome of these microorganisms. Annotation of the detected metabolite clusters with a mass fragmentation database revealed several compounds not previously known to be produced by Massilia species. To secure sufficient material for further structural analyses as well as biological testing, we selected the most promising producer strains from our molecular networking analysis and subjected them to larger&#8208;scale cultivation. Following extraction and UV&#8208;directed isolation, we obtained five metabolites in milligram quantities. In addition to a cyclic dipeptide, we elucidated the structures of four acyl amino acids that are related to thalassotalic acid C from the marine bacterium Thalassotalea sp. The Massilia&#8208;derived kyonggic acids were found to inhibit the enzyme tyrosinase, which is involved in melanin biosynthesis influencing skin and hair pigmentation. This study illustrates the value of combining spectroscopic and computational tools in natural product discovery in order to detect and guide the isolation of previously overlooked bioactive compounds.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Synthesis Applied to Optoelectronic and Energy Materials: Design, Applications and Limitations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic Covalent Chemistry can bring together simple components to create complex self&#8208;assembled materials. This strategy is so far under&#8208;investigated in the field of optoelectronic and energy materials. However, it has the potential to rapidly produce self&#8208;assembled organic semiconductors or stimuli responsive devices. Herein, we highlight the advantages of the dynamic covalent approaches and their limitations when applied to this field.







Abstract
Dynamic Covalent Chemistry, consisting in the use of dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) to create complex objects by working at the thermodynamic equilibrium, has undeniable advantages for the preparation of conjugated systems with tailored optoelectronic properties for organic electronics. Chemists can combine simple building blocks with simple functional groups of appropriate geometry, structure and stoichiometry to build multidimensional conjugated architectures. Dynamic covalent reactions are often precious metal&#8208;free, generate little to no side products and are very efficient. DCBs however afford sensitive materials, and consequently a balance needs to be found between the ease of synthesis, the stability and the performances. The dynamicity of the target materials hence can considerably reduce their applicability in organic electronics where strongly stable materials are needed, but opens the door to stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviour and recyclability. A way to overcome dynamicity issues is to lock DCBs, but often at the cost of decreased conjugation. In this review, we will highlight how DCBs are employed to prepare functional optoelectronically active materials, such as discrete molecules, polymers or covalent organic frameworks, applied in fields ranging from organic light&#8208;emitting diodes and solar cells to organic batteries and transistors. We will also discuss their limitations, benefits and the current challenges to overcome.

         <title>Double Winding Vine&#8208;Shaped Biphenyl with Molecular Asymmetry. Synthesis, Structure, and Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biphenyl strapped by two chains between benzene rings gives a double winding vine&#8208;shaped structure suggesting a new class of molecular asymmetry, in which enantioinversion hardly occurs.







Abstract
A biphenyl derivative in which two benzene rings are strapped with two chains is prepared. The synthesized product shows molecular asymmetry, which was confirmed by HPLC analysis with chiral column and named as winding vine&#8208;shaped biphenyl. The synthesis of such vine shaped molecule was performed by ring&#8208;closing metathesis or alternatively by annulation with nosylated ethylenediamine. The structure of the obtained product was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The absolute configuration of the molecular asymmetry was assigned after leading to the corresponding camphor sulfonamide through denosylation and re&#8208;amidation process.

         <title>Base&#8208;Regulated Synthesis of the Bestmann&#8208;Ohira or Seyferth&#8208;Gilbert Reagent Utilizing FSO2N3</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bestmann&#8208;Ohira reagent (BOR) and Seyferth&#8208;Gilbert reagent (SGR) were synthesized using FSO2N3 in the presence of a base. While BOR is formed with DBU as a base, SGR is formed with MgO as a base. Moreover, the facile one&#8208;pot synthesis of terminal alkynes from aldehydes has been established, which could be further coupled with azides to deliver triazoles using CuAAC click chemistry.







Abstract
Herein, we present a new application of fluorosulfonylazide (FSO2N3) for diazotizing a series of activated methylene compounds to deliver the corresponding diazo products. Notably, by the judicious choice of bases, the selective generation of the Bestmann&#8208;Ohira reagent (BOR) or the Seyferth&#8208;Gilbert reagent (SGR) has been realized from FSO2N3 and dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxopropylphosphonate. We also investigated the kinetics of the homologation of aldehydes using these two reagents with K2CO3 as a base in MeOH, finding that a faster reaction rate was achieved by using SGR. Moreover, the facile one&#8208;pot synthesis of terminal alkynes from aldehydes has been established, which could be further coupled with azides to deliver triazoles using CuAAC click chemistry.

         <title>A ChemoEnzymatic Approach for the Preparation of &#8220;Linear&#8208;Shaped&#8221; Diaryl Pyrazines as Potential Antiprotozoal Agents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from simple, commercially available aromatic aldehydes, &#8220;linear&#8208;shaped&#8221; diaryl pyrazines were prepared by a novel chemoenzymatic route comprising a biocatalyzed benzoin condensation reaction and a transaminase&#8208;mediated tandem process of transamination and cyclization. The obtained pyrazines were tested for their potential leishmanicidal and antiplasmodial activity in&#8197;vitro.







Abstract
Nitrogenous heterocyclic rings are present in a wide range of drugs, natural compounds, and fine chemicals and are considered privileged scaffolds in medicinal chemistry. Seeking novel anti&#8208;protozoal drugs acting on new targets or by novel mechanisms of action, we focused on a preliminary evaluation of the potential of &#8220;linear&#8208;shaped&#8221; diaryl pyrazines. To this purpose, a two&#8208;enzyme chemoenzymatic synthesis of this heteroaromatic core was carried out. Specifically, starting from simple, commercially available aromatic aldehydes, the target pyrazines were obtained through a sequence of biocatalytic benzoin condensation, chemical oxidation and a transaminase&#8208;mediated tandem process of transamination and cyclization. The profiles of the compounds as antiprotozoal agents were evaluated in&#8197;vitro against parasites cultures of the Leishmania and Plasmodium genera and using the human cell line HepG2.

Seeking novel anti-protozoal drugs acting on new targets or by novel mechanisms of action, we focused on a preliminary evaluation of the potential of &#8220;linear-shaped&#8221; diaryl pyrazines. To this purpose, a two-enzyme chemoenzymatic synthesis of this heteroaromatic core was carried out. Specifically, starting from simple, commercially available aromatic aldehydes, the target pyrazines were obtained through a sequence of biocatalytic benzoin condensation, chemical oxidation and a transaminase-mediated tandem process of transamination and cyclization. The profiles of the compounds as antiprotozoal agents were evaluated in&#8197;vitro against parasites cultures of the &lt;i&gt;Leishmania&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; genera and using the human cell line HepG2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>[N&#8722;I&#8722;N] Type Halogen Bonding: Structure, Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[N&#8722;I&#8722;N] type halogen bonds have gradually attracted much attention. This concept summarizes the structure, classification, synthesis, and application of [N&#8722;I&#8722;N] type halogen bonds. The challenges in this field were identified and its development prospects are also discussed.







Abstract
Halogen bond has received widespread attention in recent years due to the vast applications in supramolecular chemistry, sensing and crystal engineering. In contrast to the normal halogen bonds, [N&#8722;I&#8722;N] type halogen bond exhibits enhanced strength and solvent resistance capabilities. It adopts a bonding geometry of the three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron bond, where the nitrogen can be a neutral, positive, or negative species such as pyridine, saccharin, and urotropine moieties. The emerging new type halogen bond has found specific potentials in constructing supramolecular architectures and catalysis. This concept provides a brief summary based on recent developments of [N&#8722;I&#8722;N] type halogen bonding, reviewing and summarizing its synthesis, structure and application.

         <title>Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 Compound&#8208;Activated DMSO: An Efficient Oxidizing Reagent to Convert Alcohols to Ketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When high&#8208;valent Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 compounds meet DMSO, a unique platform is set up to manipulate sulfonium chemistry. A case study of oxidation of alcohols to ketones is shown herein. Crucial trifluoromethoxysulfonium is initially generated, and reacts with alcohols to give new alkoxysulfonium species via ligand exchange. Subsequent base&#8208;promoted E2 elimination gives ketones with the release of Me2S.







Abstract
In this study high&#8208;valent Cu(III) trifluoromethyl compounds in combination with DMSO is shown to be an efficient and mild oxidizing system for the conversion of alcohols to ketones (aldehydes as well). Trifluoromethoxylated sulfonium species is proposed to be initially formed that engages in crucial steps of alkoxy replacement at sulfonium center and deprotonative collapse of the resulting alkoxysulfonium intermediate in the presence of a base. This reaction is highly selective without over&#8208;oxidation, and can tolerate a broad range of functional groups owing to mild oxidizing ability of the Cu(III)&#8208;CF3/DMSO system and the inert N2 conditions. This method can be applied to the synthesis and functionalization of commercial drug compounds. This study illustrates an unusual reactivity property of high&#8208;valent Cu(III) trifluoromethyl compounds beyond the conventional CF3 group transfer reactivity, and opens up new opportunities for developing novel reactions of Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 compounds. The combined use of high&#8208;valent Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 compound and DMSO is anticipated to find more applications to develop other novel and useful oxidation reactions.

         <title>Mechanochemical Assembly of a Nitrile&#8208;Based Directing Group in Arylacetic Acids Using the Passerini 3&#8208;CR: Exploration of the Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed meta&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H Bond Olefination Process</title>

         <dc:description>
A practical solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical protocol for installing a nitrile&#8208;based directing group in arylacetic acids through the Passerini 3&#8208;CR and the subsequent Pd(II)&#8208;mediated meta&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H olefination process has been developed.







Abstract
The multicomponent assembly of a nitrile&#8208;based directing group in a set of arylacetic acids under solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical conditions using the Passerini 3&#8208;CR and the subsequent Pd(II)&#8208;mediated meta&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H bond olefination process has been achieved. The protocol demonstrated that removing the DG under mild conditions from the activated Passerini adducts affords a novel N&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;cyanophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyacetamide, which can be re&#8208;utilized in the future as DG in other distal activation processes.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free ipso&#8208;Halocyclization of N&#8208;Arylpropynamides Using Hypervalent Iodine(III) Reagents under Aqueous Condition</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient intramolecular ipso&#8208;halocyclization of para&#8208;unsubstituted N&#8208;arylpropynamides proceeds using readily available hypervalent iodine reagents as oxidant and potassium halides as halogen source under aqueous medium. This method shows a broad substrate scope and doesn't require any metal catalysts.







Abstract
We report, an intramolecular ipso&#8208;halocyclization of N&#8208;arylpropynamides using readily available hypervalent iodine reagent as mild oxidant and alkali halides like KCl, KBr, and KI as the halogen source. Using this method, a broad range of valuable halogenated spiro[4.5]trienones can be obtained in an excellent yield at room temperature. Notably, this protocol doesn't require para&#8208;substituents such as methoxy or fluoro group on the N&#8208;aryl ring. Also, this reaction takes place in the absence of any metal catalyst under aqueous conditions and exhibits a broad substrate scope with high functional group tolerance.

&lt;p&gt;An efficient intramolecular &lt;i&gt;ipso&lt;/i&gt;-halocyclization of &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-unsubstituted &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-arylpropynamides proceeds using readily available hypervalent iodine reagents as oxidant and potassium halides as halogen source under aqueous medium. This method shows a broad substrate scope and doesn't require any metal catalysts.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report, an intramolecular &lt;i&gt;ipso&lt;/i&gt;-halocyclization of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-arylpropynamides using readily available hypervalent iodine reagent as mild oxidant and alkali halides like KCl, KBr, and KI as the halogen source. Using this method, a broad range of valuable halogenated spiro[4.5]trienones can be obtained in an excellent yield at room temperature. Notably, this protocol doesn't require &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-substituents such as methoxy or fluoro group on the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-aryl ring. Also, this reaction takes place in the absence of any metal catalyst under aqueous conditions and exhibits a broad substrate scope with high functional group tolerance. A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed based on control experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The arylation of 5,4&#8208;disubstituted 2,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;3H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3&#8208;thiones was investigated under Ullmann&#8208;type reaction conditions involving ligand&#8208;free Cu(0) catalysis, the results of which showed that the reaction proceeds chemoselectively with the formation of S&#8208;arylation products. In some cases, when an electron&#8208;withdrawing group is present in the arylating agent, the reaction can proceed without a catalyst.







Abstract
We investigated the S&#8208;arylation of 5,4&#8208;disubstituted 2,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;3H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3&#8208;thiones under ligand&#8208;free Cu(0) catalysis employing Ullmann&#8208;type reaction conditions. We determined optimal reaction conditions and assessed the impact of substituents in the arylating agent on the reaction progress. Notably, the presence of an electron&#8208;withdrawing group (EWG) in the aryl halide facilitated the reaction even without a catalyst. In particular, an EWG in the para position of the aromatic ring exerted a directing effect on the leaving group, regardless of the halogen present.

         <dc:description>n&#8208;Bu4NI/K2S2O8&#8208;mediated C&#8208;N coupling between aldehydes and amides is reported. A strong electronic effect is observed on the aromatic aldehyde substrates.

         <title>Aerobic Photoredox Catalyzed Oxamate Ester Synthesis from Bromodifluoroacetate Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel synthetic method for oxamate esters using bromodifluoroacetate esters and amines under aerobic photoredox catalysis. In contrast to previous methods that require the use of moisture&#8208;sensitive precursors and/or harsh conditions, this method utilizes bench&#8208;stable bromodifluoroacetate esters as an oxamate ester precursor under mild conditions, providing a variety of oxamate esters.







Abstract
Here we report an aerobic photoredox catalysis approach to oxamate ester synthesis using bromodifluoroacetate esters and amines under open&#8208;air conditions. Oxamate ester is an important skeleton found in bioactive molecules and used as a synthetic building block. However, previous synthetic methods require the use of moisture&#8208; and air&#8208;sensitive precursors and/or harsh conditions, limiting accessible oxamate esters. The present method uses bench&#8208;stable bromodifluoroacetate esters and amines under mild photoredox catalytic conditions to furnish a wide variety of oxamate esters. Combining photoredox catalysis with aerobic oxygenation enables the use of bromodifluoroacetate ester as a precursor for the synthesis of oxamate esters via fluoroglyoxylate esters.

Abstract
A facile, one&#8208;pot sequential synthesis of highly substituted pyrrole employing TBAI/TBHP has been developed from readily available precursors. &#946;&#8208;Enaminones generated in&#8197;situ from &#946;&#8208;ketoesters and primary amines react sequentially with electron&#8208;deficient alkynes via a radical pathway to form the penta&#8208;substituted pyrroles in moderate to good yields. This strategy for the synthesis of highly functionalized pyrroles can be scaled up and shows tolerance to a variety of amines.

         <title>NIS/TEMPO&#8208;Promoted Oxidative Cyanation and Nitro&#8208;Mannich Reaction of Tertiary Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NIS/TEMPO&#8208;mediated procedure for the C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reaction of tertiary amines with trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) and nitroalkanes was developed. The N&#8208;Mannich base formed from the tertiary amine and NIS had a stabilizing effect on the iminium intermediate.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free N&#8208;iodosuccinimde (NIS)/2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyloxy (TEMPO)&#8208;promoted protocol was developed for the oxidative cyanation and nitro&#8208;Mannich reaction of tertiary amines via a cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reaction under mild conditions. Several control experiments were performed; the coupling reaction outcomes indicated that the C&#8722;N coupled intermediate (N&#8208;Mannich base) formed from the tertiary amine and NIS had a stabilizing effect on the iminium cation.

Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced metal&#8208;free three&#8208;component amidoheteroarylation of alkenes to synthesize &#946;&#8208;(hetero)arylethylamines







Abstract
Herein, visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced metal&#8208;free three&#8208;component amidoheteroarylation of alkenes with quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and N&#8208;sulfonylaminopyridinium salts is developed. This protocol involves a radical relay process in which the N&#8208;centered radicals undergo chemoselective addition to alkenes to form an alkyl radical that selectively combines with heteroarenes, leading to the formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds in one step under mild reaction conditions. The involved high efficiency and selectivity, wide substrate scope, and excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility demonstrate the practicability of the developed protocol.

         <title>A New Strategy for the Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Crambescin B Decarboxylate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(+)&#8208;Crambescin B decarboxylate was synthesized using a new synthetic strategy, which is nine steps shorter than the previously reported shortest method. We determined its cytotoxicity and protective effects in neuronal HT22 cells with an MTS assay. Cell viability was observed to decrease in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner without cell detachment or shrinkage. Additionally, the compound protected glutamate&#8208;induced cell death.







Abstract
Crambescin B decarboxylate is an inhibitor of voltage&#8208;gated sodium channels and a potential biochemical tool. Herein, we report the asymmetric total synthesis of crambescin B decarboxylate using a new synthetic strategy. The key aspects of this new protocol include: 1) the use of an optically pure epoxide, synthesized by the Jacobsen hydrolytic kinetic resolution, as the starting material for guanidino&#8208;aziridine, and 2) the introduction of the THF ring through nucleophilic substitution using an acyl anion equivalent. The synthetic protocol reported herein is nine steps shorter than the previously reported shortest method. We determined the cytotoxicity and protective effects of crambescin B decarboxylate in mouse&#8208;hippocampus&#8208;derived neuronal HT22 cells with an MTS assay. Cell viability was observed to decrease in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner without cell detachment or shrinkage. In addition, crambescin B decarboxylate protected glutamate&#8208;induced cell death.

         <title>Hexafluoroisopropanol Promoted Ring&#8208;Opening&#8208;Cyclization of Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropanes with Primary Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free, ring&#8208;opening&#8208;cyclization reaction of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes with primary amines is reported with HFIP.







Abstract
We reveal here a catalyst&#8208;free, ring&#8208;opening&#8208;cyclization of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes with primary amines to synthesize functionalized dihydropyrroles. This protocol avoids inert conditions and solvents promoted by hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP). The reaction is quite general with aryl, alkyl, and alicyclic amines. A good number of cyclopropanes bearing keto groups reacted excellently to produce the desired products. Further, we complemented this method with Meldrum's acid&#8208;derived cyclopropanes for synthesizing &#947;&#8208;lactams. We have demonstrated the post&#8208;synthetic applications of the products and gram&#8208;scale synthesis to highlight the adaptability of this synthetic protocol.

         <dc:description>
Phosphine&#8208;catalyzed chemodivergent reactions of p&#8208;QMs have been developed. The direct 1,6&#8208;addition of p&#8208;QMs with thiols was catalyzed by P(4&#8208;FC6H4)3, while P(4&#8208;MeC6H4)3 catalyzed the tandem addition/self&#8208;aldol condensation reactions of p&#8208;QMs with 1,4&#8208;dithiane&#8208;2,5&#8208;diol. Furthermore, one of the products diarylmethyl thioether was shown to have an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of all cancer cell types in the study.







Abstract
Phosphine&#8208;catalyzed chemodivergent reactions of para&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) affording a wide variety of diarylmethyl thioether derivatives have been reported. In the transformation presented in this work, P(4&#8208;FC6H4)3 catalyzed the direct 1,6&#8208;addition of p&#8208;QMs with thiols, whereas P(4&#8208;MeC6H4)3 promoted the tandem addition/self&#8208;aldol condensation reactions of p&#8208;QMs with 1,4&#8208;dithiane&#8208;2,5&#8208;diol. Moreover, some of the obtained products were screened against cancer cell lines HepG2, NB4, and K562, and one was found to inhibit the proliferation of all the tested cancer cell types.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Branch Selective C&#8208;H Alkylation of Indoles and Azoles with Alkenes: An Additive&#8208; and Solvent&#8208;Free Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of sustainable protocols for the synthesis of alkylated heteroarenes is crucial owing to their widespread existence in medicinally relevant and bioactive natural products. Herein, we describe an efficient, additive&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free approach for the regioselective C&#8722;H alkylation of indoles and azoles with alkenes using a nickel catalyst, which proceeds through a chelation&#8208;assistance strategy. The reaction exclusively provided branched alkylated products with the compatibility of alkyl, alkoxy, fluoro, trifluoromethyl, alkene, cyano, ester, and carbonyl groups. This protocol is applicable to other heteroarenes, such as imidazoles and benzimidazoles, providing the desired alkylated products with exclusive Markovnikov selectivity. The synthetic utility and scale&#8208;up of the reaction are demonstrated, and the protocol is in concord with the principles of green chemistry. Alkylation proceeds through facile and reversible C&#8722;H nickelation and alkene insertion processes, presumably involving rate&#8208;limiting reductive elimination.</dc:description>

This protocol is applicable to other heteroarenes, such as imidazoles and benzimidazoles, providing the desired alkylated products with exclusive Markovnikov selectivity. The synthetic utility and scale-up of the reaction are demonstrated, and the protocol is in concord with the principles of green chemistry. Alkylation proceeds through facile and reversible C&#8722;H nickelation and alkene insertion processes, presumably involving rate-limiting reductive elimination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Simple Device for Automated Mixing of Heterogeneous Solid&#8208;Liquid Reactions During In&#8208;Situ Monitoring by NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plunger&#8208;based device has been developed for the automated mixing of heterogeneous solid&#8208;liquid reactions in a 5&#8197;mm tube inside a standard NMR probe. The plunger design, plunger velocity, settling time, and mixing&#8208;to&#8208;acquisition time ratio are explored by NMR and UV&#8208;Vis to determine the optimum parameters for reaction kinetics to be monitored in&#8208;situ.







Abstract
In&#8208;situ NMR spectroscopy can provide valuable insight into chemical reactions, including detailed information on reaction kinetics and thus mechanism. The application of in&#8208;situ NMR techniques to heterogeneous reactions has so far been limited by the requirement for efficient mixing, which is challenging within the confines of a standard NMR spectrometer. We report an automated plunger&#8208;based device for the mixing of heterogeneous solid&#8208;liquid reactions conducted within a 5&#8197;mm tube in a standard NMR probe, allowing reaction kinetics and speciation to be monitored in&#8208;situ. The system has been tested by measuring the kinetics for three diverse reactions and comparison of these with the reaction velocities measured by routine ex&#8208;situ analysis after sampling. The effect of key parameters including plunger design, plunger velocity, solid settling time, and mixing&#8208;to&#8208;acquisition time ratio are explored to determine the optimum parameters for combining efficient mixing with spectral quality. With adaptation, the device may also be suitable for benchtop NMR.

The reaction features mild reaction conditions, good functional group compatibility and good yields. Furthermore, when using chiral PyBox ligand, this strategy could also achieve the asymmetric synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[b][1,4]oxazines.

         <title>Novel Imidazole&#8208;based Hydrazonoyl Cyanides and Amidrazones Containing N(N,O)&#8208;Heterocycles: Selective Synthesis, Reaction Mechanisms and Preliminary Anticancer Evaluation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two series of novel hybrid heterocyclic compounds that combine the imidazole ring with bioactive piperidine, morpholine or piperazine heterosystems, through a hydrazone unit, were easily obtained by two competitive pathways. Starting from 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoformimidoyl imidazoles and 1&#8208;aminopiperidine, 4&#8208;aminomorpholine or 1&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;methylpiperazine under mild acidic media led to the selective synthesis of 5&#8208;aminoimidazole 4&#8208;carboxamidrazones, whereas the corresponding 4&#8208;hydrazonoyl cyanide derivatives were obtained under stronger acidic conditions. These highly functionalized imidazoles provide convenient synthetic precursors to a vast array of heterocycles with potential pharmaceutical applications.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two series of novel hybrid heterocyclic compounds that combine the imidazole ring with bioactive piperidine, morpholine or piperazine heterosystems, through a hydrazone unit, were easily obtained by two competitive pathways. Starting from 5-amino-4-cyanoformimidoyl imidazoles and 1-aminopiperidine, 4-aminomorpholine or 1-amino-4-methylpiperazine under mild acidic media led to the selective synthesis of 5-aminoimidazole 4-carboxamidrazones, whereas the corresponding 4-hydrazonoyl cyanide derivatives were obtained under stronger acidic conditions. These highly functionalized imidazoles provide convenient synthetic precursors to a vast array of heterocycles with potential pharmaceutical applications. The reaction mechanisms were elucidated on the basis of experimental assays and in silico calculations. The compounds were screened against colorectal cancer HCT116-p53 wt cell line, and significant IC50 values of 3.69 &#181;M and 4.83 &#181;M were obtained.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
We present a method for the synthesis of substituted indolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoline&#8208;5(6H)&#8208;ones starting from 1&#8208;(2&#8208;ethynylphenyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indoles. The transformation involves gold&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of the triple bond followed by acid&#8208;promoted intramolecular cyclization at the indole C2 position. Demonstrating noteworthy versatility, the reaction tolerates a wide array of substituents on the indole core and proceeds in good to excellent yields (up to 93&#8201;%).

         <title>Practical and Selective Syntheses of S&#8208;Acyl and N&#8208;Acyl Glutathiones with N&#8208;Acyl Imidazoles in Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a simple and efficient glutathione acylation reaction for the chemoselective synthesis of S&#8208; or N&#8208;acylated glutathione derivatives, under mild conditions and using water as the solvent, by means of the in&#8208;situ formation of acyl imidazole electrophiles from the respective abundant carboxylic acid.







Abstract
A selective, mild, convenient, and green protocol for the preparation of S&#8208;acyl and N&#8208;acyl glutathiones is described involving the chemical modification of glutathione (GSH) with N&#8208;acyl imidazoles at room temperature in water. The syntheses of S&#8208;acyl glutathiones were achieved in very high yields using 1 equiv. of an N&#8208;acyl imidazole in water at room temperature, without the need of a base. Double acylation of GSH with various N&#8208;acyl imidazoles in weakly basic aqueous media in the presence of N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (HOSu) as the activating reagent followed by selective deprotection of the S&#8208;acyl group with aqueous ammonia at room temperature gave high yields of N&#8208;acyl glutathiones. Moreover, the reaction could accommodate a diverse range of carboxylic acids such as (hetero)benzoic acids, phenylacetic acids, aliphatic acids from short&#8208;chain fatty acids (including acetic acid), long&#8208;chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, secondary or tertiary amino acids, and carboxylic acids containing clickable functional groups, fluorescent probes, or drugs.

         <title>Hypersensitive Inhibition of Organocatalysts by Halide Salts: Are Two Catalysts Involved in the Mannich Reaction?</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conformationally flexible tertiary amine&#8212;thiourea&#8208;urea catalysts 1 and 2 for the Mannich reaction between imines and malonate esters are efficiently inhibited by quaternary ammonium halides. NMR titrations, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and NOE experiments showed that the catalysts bind chloride and bromide ions with relatively high affinities (K = 103&#8211; 105 M&#8211;1 in acetonitrile). The halide ions not only block the active site of the catalysts, but they also refold into catalytically inactive conformations upon complexation in an allosteric&#8208;like event. At substoichiometric inhibitor:catalyst ratios, the catalysts displayed hypersensitivity to the inhibitors, with overall rates that were lower than those expected from simple 1st order kinetics and 1:1 inhibitor:catalyst stoichiometry. To rationalize the observed hypersensitivity, different kinetic scenarios were examined. For catalyst 2 and the Takemoto catalyst (6), the data is consistent with 2nd order dependency on catalyst concentration, suggesting that a mechanism involving only a single catalyst in the catalytic cycle is not operative. For catalyst 1, an alternative scenario involving 1st order in catalyst and catalyst poisoning&#160;could also rationalize the hypersensitivity. Inhibition of catalysts 1 and 2 by halide salts led to significant loss of enantioselectivity, but Takemoto catalyst 6&#160;was inhibited&#160;with essentially no change in enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photocatalyzed oxidation of functionalized cyclobutanones to access g&#8208;lactones has been performed in acetonitrile at room temperature, using anthraquinone derivatives as catalysts in the presence of TFA. The best reaction results were obtained by using 3 mol % of 9,10&#8208;anthraquinone as a catalyst under 370 nm irradiation in an O2 environment. The scope and the limitations of this reaction have been investigated using both 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;substituted cyclobutanones, as well as enantiopure ketones, to obtain full preservation of their stereochemical identity after the oxidation. The process furnishes in most cases the desired compounds with high purity after catalyst removal by simple filtration, and reducing the production of solvents waste.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Copper&#8208;Free Sonogashira Coupling in Water and under Ambient Atmosphere</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sonogashira coupling is one of the cornerstone Palladium mediated cross coupling reactions, giving a direct and high yield access to symmetric and non&#8208;symmetric alkynes with high tolerance of substituents. The method generally requires the use of CuI as a cocatalyst, an inert atmosphere to protect palladium catalyst, somewhat harsh conditions like prolonged heating and the use of organic solvents due to the hydrophobicity of reagents and products. Leveraging on the opportunities offered by micellar catalysis, we here present a general methodology to perform Sonogashira coupling in water, with moderate or no heating, under air, without copper co&#8208;catalysts and at very low catalyst loading. The method offers the same generality and scope of organic solvents based couplings, but strongly improves sustainability while offering excellent yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and Electronic Impacts of the Axial Substitution at the Phosphorus Center of C(sp3)&#8208;Bridged P&#8208;Heterotriangulenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structural and electronic properties of the dimethylmethylene&#8208;bridged P&#8208;heterotriangulene have been systematically modulated by functionalization of its phosphorus center. The optoelectronic properties of the obtained derivatives in solution were characterized by UV/Vis absorption and emission spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and 31P NMR spectroscopy. The solid state structures were analyzed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The experimental results were corroborated by density functional theory calculations which revealed the crucial influence of the axial substitution on the bowl&#8208;shaped geometry of the phosphorus&#8208;centered polycyclic scaffold, which is proportional to the s&#8208;character of the P&#8211;X bond. The advantage of the bowl&#8208;shaped P&#8208;heterotriangulene scaffold was demonstrated by successful co&#8208;crystallization with fullerene C60.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Promoted Minisci&#8211;Type Cyanoalkylation of Azauracils via C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;induced Minisci&#8211;type cyanoalkylation of azauracils and cyclobutanone oxime esters was developed under metal&#8208;free and base&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
A photo&#8208;induced Minisci&#8211;type cyanoalkylation of azauracils was developed under metal&#8208;free and base&#8208;free conditions. Readily available cyclobutanone oxime esters were used as the cyanoalkylating reagents via C&#8722;C bond cleavage to generate the &#947;&#8208;cyanoalkyl azauracil derivatives in good to moderate yields. The introduced cyano group can be easily converted into many other functional groups, thus makes current protocol more practical.

         <title>Selective Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Dimerization of Styrenes and Acrylates in Molten Tetrabutylammonium Acetate as an Ionic Liquid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective dimerization of styrenes and acrylates was possible with a very low amount of palladium acetate in molten tetrabutylammonium acetate. The coupling of substituted vinyl arenes gave exclusively the (E,E)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diarylbutadiene motif within 7&#8211;10 h, whereas butyl acrylate was converted into dibutyl 2&#8208;methyleneglutarate in less than 2 h. The catalytic pathways involved in the two processes were elucidated along with the role of the ionic liquid.







Abstract
A method for the selective dimerization of styrenes and acrylates has been developed. The reaction is catalyzed by a very low amount of palladium acetate in molten tetrabutylammonium acetate without the need for any additional ligand. The use of this method enabled the coupling of substituted vinyl arenes in reasonable yields to give exclusively the (E,E)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diarylbutadiene motif within 7&#8211;10 h. Acrylates, on the other hand, exhibit higher reactivity, and the use of dibutyl acrylate resulted in the quantitative synthesis of dibutyl 2&#8208;methyleneglutarate in less than 2 h. This selectivity is unprecedented in the literature. The role of the ionic liquid and the different catalytic pathways involved in the two processes were also elucidated.

         <title>Chiroptical Properties of a Cryptophane Soluble at Neutral pH</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article reports the synthesis of the two enantiomers of a water&#8208;soluble cryptophane 3 enabling cesium and thallium complexation at neutral or basic pH. The two enantiomers of 3 were obtained in a two steps synthesis from cryptophane 4, a molecule decorated with three phenol groups and three other phenol groups protected by benzyl units. The two enantiomers of 4 were isolated from liquid chromatography using chiral stationary phase. The absolute configuration of the two enantiomers of 3 was determined by vibrational circular dichroism combined with theoretical calculations. Contrary to cryptophane 1 that present large spectroscopic changes upon cesium and thallium complexation, the electronic circular dichroism spectra of compound 3 exhibit moderate spectral changes suggesting that this compound cannot change the conformation of its linkers as easily as cryptophane 1.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two cis&#8208;connected cyclic tetraphenylethylenes, [2]c&#8208;CTPE and [3]c&#8208;CTPE, were synthesized by platinum&#8208;mediated cyclization. The strain energy of [2]c&#8208;CTPE is up to 86.28&#8197;kJ&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1. [2]c&#8208;CTPE and [3]c&#8208;CTPE demonstrates typical Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) characteristics. Moreover, both [2]c&#8208;CTPE and [3]c&#8208;CTPE display mechanofluorochromic properties.







Abstract

The structure of [2]c&#8208;CTPE has been confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Practical and Divergent Synthesis of Carbocyclic Pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine Nucleoside Analogues</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented base&#8208;build&#8208;up strategy has been applied for the synthesis of carbocyclic pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine nucleoside analogues. The analogues were synthesized at the very last stage to provide swift access to a concise set of compounds. A methoxy&#8208;substituted analogue displayed low micromolar activity against Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma rhodesiense.







Abstract
A concise set of 4&#8208;substituted pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine carboriboside analogues was synthesized in a divergent fashion via a central intermediate. An oxaziridine reagent allowed the synthesis of a crucial hydrazine glycon intermediate, which was transformed through a base&#8208;build&#8208;up strategy into the desired intermediate using a commercially available pyrimidine building block. Reaction with a variety of nucleophiles allowed late&#8208;stage diversification. All analogues were evaluated for activity against a representative panel of Trypanosomatida. A methoxy&#8208;substituted analogue displayed single&#8208;digit micromolar activity against two subspecies of Trypanosoma brucei in cellular assays.

         <title>Elucidating&#160;the Key Factors in Hydroamination and Defluoroamination Competitions: A DFT Analysis of Reaction between &#945;&#8208;(Trifluoromethyl)styrene and 2&#8208;Pyridones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;fluorocarbanions have garnered considerable attention for their dual reactivity in nucleophilic processes and &#946;&#8208;fluorine elimination. Herein, we reported a thorough computational analysis of the reactions between &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)styrenes and 2&#8208;pyridones to delineate the factors determining protonation or defluorination pathways for the in situ generated &#946;&#8208;fluorocarbanions under varied basic conditions. Our findings illuminate the critical role of organobase basicity in steering the direction of the competitive protonation and &#946;&#8208;fluorine elimination reactions. We propose the use of pKaH values of organobases as a quantitative indicator for discerning the predominant reaction pathways. This provides an efficient approach to predict the reaction outcome, facilitating the deliberate design of reactions to leverage the unique reactivity of &#946;&#8208;fluorocarbanions in the realm of fluorine chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Inorganic ligand&#8208;supported copper catalysts catalyzing alkyne coupling reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glaser&#8208;coupled synthesized 1,3&#8208;diyne can participate in the generation of conjugated polymers and is now widely used in organic and polymer synthesis. Currently, the catalysts in coupling are mostly based on the complexation of noble metals with complex organic ligands, which inevitably increases the research cost and storage difficulty. However, polymetallic oxides (POMs), with acidic and redox properties, can be used as excellent inorganic ligands with low cost and easy storage. In this work, we have synthesized copper catalysts 1, (NH4)4[CuMo6O18(OH)6] with polymetallic oxides as inorganic ligands in a facile way and applied them in the coupling of alkynes to obtain (non)symmetrical conjugated 1,3&#8208;diynes in high yields without bases, finally proposing a reasonable reaction path. In addition, the catalyst showed good tolerance to a variety of different groups, further demonstrating its excellent catalytic activity. It is worth mentioning that the catalyst maintained its good structure and activity after six cycles, demonstrating its promising potential for industrial applications. Thus, this paper provides a new strategy for the preparation of (un)symmetrical diynes using polymetallic oxides of Cu as catalysts, and also demonstrates the potential of multi&#8208;acid catalysts for organocatalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over past few decades, synthetic chemists are working tirelessly for the development of environmentally benign and economically competent carbon&#8208;oxygen bond formation processes. Various oxidizing reagents and catalysts are being used to serve this purpose. Among all, t&#8208;butyl hydrogen peroxide (TBHP) has emerged as a greener and economically viable oxygen source, radical initiator and precursor of t&#8208;BuO&#8226; and t&#8208;BuOO&#8226; radicals. It has been extensively utilized as a reagent for the synthesis of epoxides, ketones, secondary alcohols, heterocyclic rings like benzofurans, isoquinoline and many more. The present review will unfold the recent advancements made in the field of TBHP&#8208;promoted C&#8208;O bond formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Dielectrophilic Approach to Sequential Heterofunctionalization of Ethylene from Vinylthianthrenium Salt</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinyl thianthrenium salt is a compound with interesting electrophilic properties capable of reacting with two distinct nucleophiles. By using&#160;b&#8208;keto esters as one of the reaction partners, it is possible to insert a chain of two carbon atoms with a further functionalization under mild conditions. We have studied this new methodology which involves the stepwise formation of a C&#8208;C and a C&#8208;X bond (with X = N, O, etc.) in one step without the use of metals. Depending on the reaction conditions and the starting ketoester, a varied reactivity has been observed and described.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of Cyclic Tertiary Alcohols with Lipase A from Candida antarctica</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme&#8208;catalyzed acylative kinetic resolution (KR) and dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic primary and secondary alcohols have been widely reported to produce esters with high enantiomeric purity. In contrast,&#160;similar KRs of tertiary alcohols have been reported for only a limited range of substrates and require prolonged reaction times of several days. To gain deeper insight into the substrate scope and increase the process efficiency, we examined the reaction conditions using commercially available immobilized lipase A from Candida antarctica and found that the addition of the heterogeneous, inorganic base sodium carbonate significantly increased the reaction rate while maintaining high enantioselectivity. The use of vinyl hexanoate as the acyl donor provided esters that were stable during chromatography purification. The optimized reaction conditions were then successfully applied to a range of cyclic tertiary alcohols containing tetralin, dihydroindene, chromane, and thiochromane skeletons having, in part, a substituent on the aromatic ring. In this study on the structure&#8211;reactivity relationship of enzymatic KR&#8208;type reactions, we achieved &gt;30% conversion for various tertiary alcohols in 24 h at 25 &#176;C, producing optically active esters with 88&#8211;99% ee.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of DNA&#8208;Conjugated Aryl Diazonium Intermediates in&#160;DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl diazonium intermediates have emerged as highly versatile intermediates in modern organic synthesis and chemical biology, demonstrating remarkable reactivity under mild reaction conditions. Their significance has extended to DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DELs), where they serve as valuable alternatives to traditional aryl halide&#8208;based cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Aryl diazonium intermediates as N2&#8208;annulation synthons can efficiently transform into benzotriazinone core on DNA besides C&#8211;C coupling. This concept paper illuminates recent advances in this field, emphasizing their applications and potential across various facets of DELs, off&#8208;DNA chemistry, DELs selection, and DNA&#8208;based probes. It is anticipated that these developments will propel the broader utilization of DNA&#8208;conjugated aryl diazonium salt intermediates in DELs, protein labeling, hit discovery, and other interdisciplinary fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct and Stereoselective Protecting&#8208;Group&#8208;Free N&#8208;ADP&#8208;Ribosylation through&#160;Traceless Staudinger Ligation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adenine diphosphate (ADP)&#8208;ribosylation catalyzed by bacterial toxins is the addition of an ADP&#8208;ribose moiety to specific amino acid residues in target proteins such as arginine, asparagine, glutamine, and histidine through 1,2&#8208;cis(&#945;)&#8208;glycosidic bond formation. ADP&#8208;ribosylation modifies host cell functions, altering normal cellular processes to facilitate their survival, and replication. Despite the development of click chemistry and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis&#8208;based approaches, the synthesis of structurally well&#8208;defined naturally occurring N&#8208;linked ADP&#8208;ribosyl molecules remains challenging. Herein, we report a direct and &#945;&#8208;selective N&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylation using unprotected &#946;&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosyl azide and triphenylphosphine esters through traceless Staudinger ligation. The stereoselectivity of this protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free N&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylation was validated by enzymatic degradation experiment and high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography, referencing synthetic standards. This method facilitated the facile and rapid synthesis of N&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosyl acetamide, biotin, fluorescent dye, amino acids, and tripeptide with complete &#945;&#8208;selectivity and moderate yields (37&#8211;55%).</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes are unique structural motifs with important applications ranging from drugs to materials. Herein, we report a novel radical&#8208;mediated defluorinative allylation of sulfamate esters&#160;with &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes through distal C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization under photoredox conditions. The reaction could readily incorporate various gem&#8208;difluoroalkene motifs into previously unfunctionalized sp3 carbon centers. The transformation allows directly dual activation of N&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds via a photocatalytic and redox&#8208;neutral process, as well as using water as environmentally friendly co&#8208;solvent. The reaction could provide a general and operationally simple method to access gem&#8208;difluoroalkene compounds with high diversity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Aryl diazonium salts are versatile compounds known for their reactivity in various transformations. In this study, we explored the arylation of 3&#8208;methylene isoindolinones using aryl diazonium salts. The objective was to develop a method for accessing 3&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;methoxyisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones, a class of compounds with diverse biological activities and synthetic importance. Optimization of the reaction conditions revealed the significance of light irradiation for improved yields. The substrate scope investigation demonstrated the compatibility of various diazonium salts and N&#8208;substituents on the 3&#8208;methylene isoindolinone scaffold, yielding the corresponding methoxy lactams with high yields. Mechanistic insights were obtained by observing the effect of base and light irradiation. Two initiation mechanisms were proposed: in the presence of a base, the reaction could proceed even without light irradiation, while light irradiation was necessary in the absence of a base. DFT calculations were performed to elucidate the mechanism of the reaction and provide energetic considerations</dc:description>

         <title>Advances in Enzymatic Incorporation of Small Fluorine Modules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organofluorine compounds find extensive application in the fields of agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, materials science, and molecular imaging. Introducing fluorine atoms can provide organic compounds with unique physicochemical properties or improve their biological activity. Although significant progress has been made in the chemical synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing compounds, achieving selective fluorination under mild conditions remains extremely challenging. Introducing biocatalytic approaches in organofluorine chemistry is an important strategy given their high efficiency, selectivity, and environmental friendliness. In this review, we present the discovery of fluorinated natural products and fluorinases, the crystal structure and the directed evolution of fluorinases, with a focus on recent advances in the enzymatic synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing compounds in recent years. It is hoped that this review will help to promote the field of biocatalytic organofluorine compound synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of a Planar&#8211;Chiral [2.2]Paracyclophane via Michael Addition to Nitroolefins Catalyzed by N&#8208;Terminal Guanidinylated Helical Peptide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;terminal guanidinylated resin&#8211;supported helical peptides were found to catalyze the kinetic resolution of a planarly chiral 4&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrovinyl)[2.2] paracyclophane via asymmetric Michael addition with an s&#8208;factor reaching up to 111.







Abstract
Kinetic resolution of 4&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrovinyl)[2.2]paracyclophane based on N&#8208;terminal&#8211;guanidinylated resin&#8211;bound helical peptide catalyzed asymmetric Michael addition of malonate esters was developed. This approach provides a new pathway to enantiopure paracyclophane derivatives characterized by both planar and central chirality, along with the recovery of the chiral substrate with a selectivity factor of up to 111. Additionally, the synthetic potential of the resulting products has been showcased through their successful transformation into derivatives of &#946;&#8208;substituted &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid.

         <title>Stereoselective Total Synthesis of Pyranicin and 4&#8208;Epi&#8208;Pyranicin from Carbohydrate Precursors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of pyranicin and 4&#8208;epi&#8208;pyranicin has been accomplished from carbohydrate precursors. The general synthetic strategy includes two main fragment formations: (1) THP fragment (2) Butenolide fragment.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a simple and efficient pathway for the total synthesis of pyranicin and 4&#8208;epi&#8208;pyranicin by utilizing carbohydrates as chiral raw materials for the first time. The general synthetic strategy involves the formation of two main fragments: Fragment 1 is the central tetrahydropyran core, which was constructed in a total of 10 steps from 2,3,4,6&#8208;tetra&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl D&#8208;glucal via Ferrier&#8208;type rearrangement and oxidative cyclization as the key steps. Fragment 2 is the butenolide fragment, which was obtained in a gram scale with a total of 14 steps from diacetyl&#8208;L&#8208;rhamnal involving a ring contraction strategy.

         <title>Exploitation of Mechanistic Product Selectivity for the Two&#8208;Step Synthesis of Optically Active Bio&#8208;Derived Cyclic Carbonates Incorporating Amino Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of cyclic carbonates bearing amino acid functionality is described. The use of enantiopure amino acids and glycidol, in the initial formation of the substrate, combined with the stereo&#8208;retentive mechanism of the cycloaddition with CO2 furnishes bio&#8208;derived cyclic carbonates which display a range of optical activities. A DFT study provides important insights into the operative mechanism.







Abstract
The synthesis of bio&#8208;derived cyclic carbonates is attracting a lot of attention as the incorporation of bio&#8208;derived functionality into these compounds provides the opportunity to prepare previously unknown structures, whilst also improving their sustainability profiles. This study presents a facile preparation of diastereomerically pure bio&#8208;derived cyclic carbonates displaying a range of optical rotation values. These compounds are obtained from glycidol, amino acids and CO2 in a facile two&#8208;step approach. Initially, the diastereomerically pure amino acid functionalised epoxides are prepared through a robust Steglich esterification of enantiopure glycidol (R or S) and an amino acid (D or L). Thereafter, in a second step, cycloaddition of the epoxide with CO2 results in the retention of the initial stereochemistry of the epoxide, furnishing novel diastereomerically pure and optically active cyclic carbonate products. A DFT study has explained the basis of this observed retention of configuration for these compounds. Further, results from this DFT study also provide new mechanistic information concerning a co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free cycloaddition reaction starting from glycidol when using the gallium&#8208;catalyst, which is found to operate through metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity.

A DFT study has explained the basis of this observed retention of configuration for these compounds. Further, results from this DFT study also provide new mechanistic information concerning a co-catalyst-free cycloaddition reaction starting from glycidol when using the gallium-catalyst, which is found to operate through metal-ligand cooperativity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Decarboxylative Amination of SMAHOs by Dialkyl Azodicarboxylates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organocatalyzed decarboxylative addition of substituted malonic acid half oxyesters (SMAHOs) to dialkyl azodicarboxylates led to the formation of &#945;&#8208;aminoester derivatives. The reaction can be performed under mild reaction conditions using 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) as a catalyst and displayed a rather important scope.







Abstract
The decarboxylative addition of substituted malonic acid half oxyesters (SMAHOs) to dialkyl azodicarboxylates is described. The reaction was promoted by 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) as an organocatalyst in heated toluene. High yields of the coupling products were generally obtained, and the scope of the reaction proved rather important with the potential presence of functionalized side chains at the &#945;&#8208;position, affording an original access to &#945;&#8208;aminoester derivatives.

         <dc:description>Nitrones are pivotal in organic chemistry, especially for the synthesis of natural and biologically active compounds via 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions and Kinugasa reactions. Although numerous methods have been reported for the synthesis of nitrones with an sp3 carbon connected to a nitrogen atom, the development of nitrones with an sp2 carbon linkage, including N&#8208;vinyl, N&#8208;aryl, and N&#8208;alkoxycarbonyl nitrones, remains relatively underexplored. This review summarizes the current research trends and methodologies for the direct synthesis of nitrones, in which an sp2 carbon is directly bonded to a nitrogen atom, beginning with oximes.</dc:description>

         <title>Commercial transaminases for the asymmetric synthesis of bulky amines.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transaminase&#8208;catalysed asymmetric amination is a valuable transformation for the synthesis of chiral amines. However, its use in synthetic chemistry has been curtailed by a narrow substrate scope and limited information on commercially available catalysts. In this work we have explored the substrate scope of selected commercially available transaminases, focusing on prochiral ketones bearing two bulky substituents and their application in both enzyme&#8208;catalysed and enzyme&#8208;triggered reactions. (R)&#8208; and/or (S)&#8208;selective enzymes converted methyl&#8208;, isopropyl&#8208;,&#160;n&#8208;butyl&#8208;, and cyclohexyl&#8208;phenone substrates to the corresponding amines in the range of 6 &#8208; &gt;99% ee. In some cases, a stereochemical switch was detected, in which (R)&#8208;enantioselectivity was observed with enzymes typically assigned as (S)&#8208;selective. Upscaling of selected biotransformations provided chiral amines, in &gt;99% ee and up to 40% isolated yield. Furthermore, transaminase&#8208;triggered reactions, which were previously limited to methyl&#8208; and ethyl&#8208;derivatives, were expanded to phenyl&#8208;derivatives for the formation of a&#160;cis&#8208;2,6&#8208;disubstituted piperidine and 2,4&#8208;diphenyl pyrroline, and isolated in up to 67% yield.</dc:description>

We have developed a one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component strategy for the Friedel&#8208;Crafts arylation of &#945;&#8208;imino ketones with imidazopyridines under catalyst&#8208;free conditions.

Abstract
We report here a catalyst&#8208;free, (sp2)C&#8722;H imination reaction of in&#8208;situ formed imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines and &#945;&#8208;iminoketones. This one&#8208;pot, multicomponent, and atom economic reaction is performed at moderate to room temperature without the need for any catalyst and inert conditions. The reaction showed good substrate tolerance with appreciable yields. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and post&#8208;synthetic modifications to obtain 1,2&#8208;diketones are also described.

&lt;p&gt;We report here a catalyst-free, (sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)C&#8722;H imination reaction of &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; formed imidazo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]pyridines and &#945;-iminoketones. This one-pot, multicomponent, and atom economic reaction is performed at moderate to room temperature without the need for any catalyst and inert conditions. The reaction showed good substrate tolerance with appreciable yields. Gram-scale synthesis and post-synthetic modifications to obtain 1,2-diketones are also described.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Catenanes Platformed with meso&#8208;Arylporphyrin</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Padlock&#8221; structures comprising cyclodextrin (CD) catenanes were successfully constructed using a strong intermolecular interaction of CD with meso&#8208;arylporphyrin in water. A water soluble Grubbs's catalyst was used for interlocking CD onto the porphyrin. The novel catenane compounds were useful to elucidate the highly specific intermolecular interactions of methylated CD to meso&#8208;(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl)porphyrins in water.







Abstract
Among mechanically interlocked supramolecular systems with cyclodextrins (CDs), successful examples of CD&#8208;based catenanes are limited compared to a number of CD rotaxanes owing to the synthetic difficulties. We herein demonstrate an efficient synthesis of a CD&#8208;based catenane using a meso&#8208;arylporphyrin (Por) platform. Using Por modified with two olefin&#8208;terminated oxyethylene chains at the cis&#8208;meso&#8208;positions, an interlocked Por&#8208;CD catenane was synthesized via olefin metathesis in the presence of per&#8208;O&#8208;methylated &#946;&#8208;CD (TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD) in water. The novel Por&#8208;CD catenane was obtained in 30&#8201;% isolated yield, which was characterized by MALDI&#8208;TOF mass and NMR spectroscopies. In the latter part, we demonstrate determination of the binding constants between TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD and meso&#8208;(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin using Por&#8208;CD catenane, 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD (DMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD), and 13C&#8208;labeled TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD (13C&#8208;TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD). The host&#8208;guest exchange reaction from the Por&#8208;CD catenane/DMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD to the Por&#8208;CD catenane/TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD complexes was directly monitored through 1D HMQC spectroscopy. The ratio of these complexes revealed the difference in the binding affinities of DMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD and TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD to Por. The stable 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 inclusion complex between meso&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin (TPPS) and TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD has been well&#8208;studied for many years. This study is the first to determine the respective binding constants, K1 and K2, using the model system, to be 3.0&#215;107&#8197;M&#8722;1 and 3.4&#215;107&#8197;M&#8722;1, respectively.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C8&#8208;Fluoroalkylation and C8&#8208;Fluoroalkenylation of Naphthalenes by C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful realization of direct palladium&#8208;catalyzed C8&#8208;fluoroalkylation and C8&#8208;fluoroalkenylation of naphthalene derivatives has been accomplished, employing iodonium salts as coupling partners. The reactions exhibited complete C8&#8208;regioselectivity, and diverse carbonyl groups were identified as effective directing groups.







Abstract
In this study, two novel C8&#8208;functionalization methods of 1&#8208;carbonylnaphthalenes were developed. Leveraging iodonium triflates as coupling partners, we disclose palladium&#8208;catalyzed C8&#8208;fluoroalkylation and C8&#8208;fluoroalkenylation processes. These protocols exhibit broad applicability across diverse naphthalene derivatives, owing to carbonyl directing groups at the C1 position which can be retained for subsequent applications or selectively removed, enhancing the versatility of the developed methodologies.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Chiral Allenes via Asymmetric 1,4&#8208;Difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;Enynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allenes represent a distinctive class of organic molecules characterized by their unique physical and chemical properties. Among them, chiral allenes play a significant role in modern chemistry. They not only serve as pivotal frameworks for natural products and drug molecules but also are essential building blocks in organic synthesis. Over the years, numerous remarkable and efficient methods have been developed for the synthesis of chiral allenes. Notably, the catalytic synthesis of chiral allenes using transition metals in conjunction with chiral ligands has garnered considerable attention. This review paper aims to provide an overview of recent advancements in the synthesis of chiral allenes through asymmetric 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;enynes, in which two distinct strategies including non&#8208;radical and radical processes are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyhalogenated Carbohydrates: Synthesis and Applications of Sugar Halides from Fluorine to Iodine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The societal importance of sucralose (a trichlorinated disaccharide) doesn't fade over time. This review focuses on the synthesis and applications of polyhalogenated carbohydrates incorporating fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine atoms. An overview of the current state of the art of sugar inter&#8208;halides is also presented.







Abstract
Polyfluorinated carbohydrates have attracted attention in the last decades. This is due to the interesting properties of such organofluorines. What about the other halogens? Since the discovery of sucralose (a trichlorinated disaccharide) more than 50&#8197;years ago, only a handful of chlorinated, brominated, or iodinated carbohydrates have been reported. This review focuses on the synthesis of polyhalogenated carbohydrates, including sugar inter&#8208;halides, but excluding polyfluorinated sugars. An overview of the current state of the art of their potential application is also described.

         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Nitroglycals are important synthons for biological active 2&#8208;aminoglycosides, glycoconjugates and natural products synthesis. Herein, we summarized the recent advance of 2&#8208;nitroglycals from 2014 to 2023. A plethora of applications on the synthesis of bioactive compounds via Michael&#8211;type addition, sugar ring opening reaction, Ferrier rearrangement were summarized. Organo&#8211;catalysis glycosylation plays a pivotal role in these applications.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Urea&#8208;, Thiourea&#8208;, and Isothiourea&#8208;Based Bifunctional Tetraarylphosphonium Salt Catalysis for Conversion of Carbon Dioxide to Cyclic Carbonates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the development of bifunctional organocatalysts for the reaction of epoxides with atmospheric pressure of carbon dioxide. Isothiourea, thiourea, and urea groups are effective hydrogen bond donors for the carbon dioxide fixation. Computational mechanistic studies disclosed key hydrogen bond interactions between catalysts and intermediates, which relied upon orientation of the binding modes.







Abstract
A novel bifunctional isothiourea derived from a tetraarylphosphonium salt catalyzes the coupling reaction of monosubstituted epoxides with 1&#8197;atm of carbon dioxide to afford five&#8208;membered cyclic carbonates in high yields. Thiourea and urea groups are also effective hydrogen bond donors for the carbon dioxide fixation. Comprehensive mechanistic studies on this catalysis using theoretical calculations disclosed key hydrogen bond interactions between catalysts and intermediates, which relied upon orientation of the binding modes.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>the integration of photovoltaic technologies within agricultural settings, also known as agrivoltaic, is attracting increasing attention as a sustainable approach to ensure both clean energy and food supply. The success of this strategy relies on the development of innovative materials that can selectively convert specific wavelengths into energy while being transparent to photosynthetically relevant light. To this aim, here we report our endeavors in the synthesis of a new class of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D quinoxaline fluorophores and their use in the preparation of wavelength&#8208;selective luminescent solar concentrators (LSC). The dyes were expeditiously prepared following a direct arylation protocol and extensively characterized by spectroscopic analyses and computational studies. They present high light harvesting ability in the green region of the visible spectrum and good emission properties, which were fully retained in the solid state when embedded into a PMMA matrix. These materials were employed to construct LSC devices of promising efficiency, fostering further developments for the use of wavelength&#8208;selective LSC in agrivoltaic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Transformation of 1,3&#8208;Cyclooctadiene into Novel Functionalized Azaheterocycles, &#946;&#8208;Amino Esters, and Lactams by Means of Ring&#8208;Rearrangement Metathesis</title>

Diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of some novel functionalized azaheterocyclic &#946;&#8208;amino esters with multiple chiral centers from 1,3&#8208;cyclooctadiene&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;amino acids has been accomplished through stereocontrolled metathesis protocols.







Abstract
Diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of some novel functionalized azaheterocyclic &#946;&#8208;amino esters with multiple chiral centers from 1,3&#8208;cyclooctadiene&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;amino acids through a stereocontrolled synthetic route has been accomplished. The strategy was based on the creation of some novel unsaturated N&#8208;protected cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino esters from 1,3&#8208;cyclooctadiene. Products were subjected to ring&#8208;opening metathesis (ROM) followed by selective ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM). A comparative investigation on the selectivity, regarding the catalysts, yields, conversions, and substrate directing effect on ring&#8208;rearrangement metathesis (RRM) transformation has been accomplished. Importantly, the procedure used in this synthetic process does not affect the configuration of the chiral centers. The pathway takes place across conservation of the configurations of the stereocenters; therefore, the architectural skeleton of the starting cyclooctene&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;amino acids predetermined the structure of the new azaheterocyclic systems.

         <title>Nitrile Furanics via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydration of Aldoximes and Knoevenagel Condensation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrile furanic compounds have been prepared employing two simple synthetic approaches; i) dehydration of aldoximes and ii) Knoevenagel condensation. Both methodologies were firstly tested and optimized on furfural and thus exploited on 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furfural (HMF) and 5,5&#8217;&#8208;oxy(bismethylene)&#8208;2&#8208;furaldehyde (OBMF). All the resulting products were achieved in good to excellent yield and isolated as pure employing simple purification procedure.







Abstract
In this work two synthetic approaches to introduce nitrile moieties into bio&#8208;based derived furanic compounds were investigated, i.&#8201;e., dehydration of aldoximes and Knoevenagel condensation. Both methodologies have been first tested and optimized on furfural and thus exploited on 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furfural (HMF) and 5,5&#8217;&#8208;oxy(bismethylene)&#8208;2&#8208;furaldehyde (OBMF). The syntheses of furfural, HMF and OBMF aldoximes were efficiently conducted (also in large scale) under mild reaction conditions and short reaction time. The subsequent dehydration to nitrile furanic compounds was carried out in the presence of catalytic amount of copper acetate monohydrate. Furthermore, Knoevenagel condensations were performed on furfural, HMF and OBMF with different Activated Methylene Group compounds, using for the first&#8208;time dimethyl carbonate as the reaction media. Most of the resulting products were isolated as pure via simple liquid&#8208;liquid extraction in good to excellent yields. Future applications of these compounds might include aldoxime reduction into amine furanics &#8208; herein also preliminary investigated &#8208; and hydrolysis of the nitrile derivatives in the related carboxylic acid (or ester) furanics. All these products are interesting monomers for the preparation of bio&#8208;based polymers.

Abstract
The treatment of diethyl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydroaminophosphonate&#8197;1 with various arenes (ArH=toluene 2&#8201;a, benzene 2&#8201;b, anisole 2&#8201;c, bromobenzene 2&#8201;d, chlorobenzene 2&#8201;e, benzyl alcohol 2&#8201;f, p&#8208;xylene 2&#8201;g) in acetic acid (AcOH) at 120&#8201;&#176;C for 8&#8197;h in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 (10&#8201;%&#8201;mol, OAc=acetate) and AgOAc (3.4&#8197;equivalents) results in the formation of the corresponding &#946;&#8208;aryl derivatives E&#8208;Ar(H)C=C(NHAc)P(O)(OEt)2 3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;g. The reaction proceeds through double C&#8722;H activation (arene and alkene) and subsequent C&#8722;C oxidative coupling (Fujiwara&#8211;Moritani reaction), processes catalyzed by Pd and assisted by Ag. The obtained products 3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;g are isosteric analogs of phenylalanine and are obtained with high selectivity. Thus, geometrical E&#8208;isomers have been obtained in all studied cases, however mixtures of ortho&#8208;/meta&#8208;/para&#8208;isomers are observed when the activated position in the starting arene 2 is considered.

         <title>Benzocoumarin&#8208;Fused Triskelions Exhibit AIEE Due to Inhibited Molecular Inversion</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triskelion&#8208;shaped AIEgens consisting of benzo[f], [g], and [h]coumarin units (2F, 2G, and 2H) were successfully synthesized through the intramolecular Ullmann coupling. These compounds adopt unique &#960;&#8208;twisted helical geometries because of the fusion mode of the benzocoumarins, and the structural isomers have different molecular thicknesses and planarities. These compounds demonstrate remarkable AIEE behaviour in the aggregated states because molecular inversion is suppressed.







Abstract
Developing aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) is a unique strategy for alleviating concentration quenching of &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic compounds. This AIE behaviour can be induced not only in organic dyes with rotors but also in invertible &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. Herein, intramolecular Ullmann coupling was used to synthesize &#960;&#8208;twisted triskelion&#8208;shaped AIEgens (2F, 2G, and 2H), in which benzo[f], [g], and [h] coumarins were fused into the benzene core to form a helical propeller shape. These structural isomers had unique molecular thicknesses and planarities depending on the fusion mode of the benzocoumarin. The racemic crystals, PPP and MMM, had different overlapping molecular configurations because of their twisted molecular frameworks. Compounds&#8197;2F, 2G and 2H demonstrated weak fluorescence emission in diluted solutions resulting from molecular motions caused by the isomerization process during molecular inversion. By comparison, aggregates exhibited enhanced emission intensity. These &#960;&#8208;twisted triskelions exhibited the characteristics of AIEgens.

Using this photocatalytic protocol, both aromatic and aliphatic thioesters can be synthesized in good yields. The transformation consists of a cascade of double SH2 reactions, HAT and an ArS group transfer, and the yields are improved when the reaction is carried out in a CO atmosphere, which serves to limit the extent of decarbonylation acyl radicals that are generated in the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydroxymethyl&#8208;Substituted Tetrathiatriarylmethanol with Variable Reactivity: Selective Access to Three Different Trityl Radicals by Unique Acid&#8208;Mediated Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of hydroxymethyl&#8208;substituted tetrathiatriarylmethanol with different acids are described. The reaction conditions were optimized for the selective synthesis of hydroxymethyl, methyl and aldehyde derivatives of trityl radicals as well as their deuterated analogues, which exhibit distinct EPR spectra and redox properties, thus suggesting applicability to in&#8208;cell EPR/dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP).







Abstract
Tetrathiatriarylmethyl radicals have found wide applications in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and imaging as well as dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). Recently, intense effort has been devoted to the derivatization of trityl radicals, but there is still a lack of highly efficient methods for access to these radicals. Herein, we report novel acid&#8208;mediated protocols for straightforward and selective synthesis of the hydroxymethyl, aldehyde and methyl derivatives of trityl radicals from the sole substrate hydroxymethyl&#8208;substituted tetrathiatriarylmethanol. The resulting trityl radicals exhibit various redox properties as shown by their cyclic voltammetric results. Importantly, the use of these protocols enables site&#8208;specific deuteration of the three trityl radicals, which show unique EPR spectral properties. Overall, our study reveals the crucial effect of the acids on the synthesis of these trityl radicals and provides a new approach for selective access to different trityl radicals, thus enriching their synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Boron Complexes of Tridentate Acyl Pyridylhydrazones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of boron complexes of tridentate acyl pyridylhydrazones were prepared. Their facile synthesis relies on arylboronic acids for boron incorporation, enabling significant structural diversity, dual&#8208;state emission, and reversible electrochemical reductions. Donor&#8208;acceptor architectures, constructed by leveraging triphenylamine and carbazole&#8208;functionalized arylboronic acids, result in aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement.







Abstract
Since the development of the chemistry and applications of boron dipyrromethene dyes (BODIPYs), numerous other platforms based on boron complexes of N&#8208;donor ligands have emerged as molecular optoelectronic materials. By tailoring the structure of the ligand bound to boron, the optical and electronic properties of a compound can be precisely tuned for unique properties, such as aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) in the case of boron difluoride hydrazones (BODIHYs). We examine the impact of modifying the typical bidentate hydrazone ligand structure used to prepare BODIHYs to enable a tridentate coordination mode to produce boron complexes of tridentate acyl pyridylhydrazones. This change allows for the use of arylboronic acids as sources of boron and facilitates the inclusion of complex organic components at the boron centre, including the formation of dye&#8208;dye conjugates. The synthesized compounds exhibit distinct optical and electronic properties when compared to BODIHYs, such as reversible electrochemical reduction and up to a &gt;300&#8197;nm pseudo&#8208;Stokes shift in the solid state, all of which were supported by density functional theory calculations.

We examine the impact of modifying the typical bidentate hydrazone ligand structure used to prepare BODIHYs to enable a tridentate coordination mode to produce boron complexes of tridentate acyl pyridylhydrazones. This change allows for the use of arylboronic acids as sources of boron and facilitates the inclusion of complex organic components at the boron centre, including the formation of dye-dye conjugates. The synthesized compounds exhibit distinct optical and electronic properties when compared to BODIHYs, such as reversible electrochemical reduction and up to a &amp;gt;300&#8197;nm &lt;i&gt;pseudo&lt;/i&gt;-Stokes shift in the solid state, all of which were supported by density functional theory calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecules containing ether skeletons are widely present in drugs, natural products, functional materials, and life science. Direct C(sp3)&#8211;H bond ether functionalization is considered a powerful strategy for the construction of novel ether derivatives.

In recent years, photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;mediated C(sp3)&#8211;H bond alkylation, arylation, alkynylation, esterification, mercaptoylation, sulfidation, and amination of ethers have been extensively studied. In this review, the research progress of photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;mediated C(sp3)&#8211;H bond functionalization of ether compounds from 2014 to 2023 is systematically reviewed, and the scope, limitations, and mechanisms for some reactions are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitration of Pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines with NaNO2/HFIP</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild nitration of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines has been reached in a NaNO2/HFIP reaction system.







Abstract
A mild nitration of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines has been reached using sodium nitrite as nitro source in HFIP at ambient temperature. A variety of nitro&#8208;bearing pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline derivatives has been efficiently prepared in poor to quantitative yields (28&#8211;98&#8201;%). These products can be easily transformed to primary amines and amide by simple chemical reactions. Treatment of other nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles such as pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoline and substituted indoles under this developed reaction system afforded nitro&#8208;bearing N&#8208;heterocycles in relatively lower yields (15&#8211;19&#8201;%).

         <title>Synthesis and Application of a New Class of Planar and Centrally Chiral Ferrocenyl Amino Alcohol Ligands</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly enantioselective, facile, scalable, and robust synthesis of a new family (14 examples) of amino alcohol ligands possessing planar and central chirality that is described. They were applied to the diethylzinc and diphenylzinc additions to aldehydes with up to 98&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee and 82&#8201;% yield and 88&#8201;% ee, respectively.







Abstract
A family of ferrocenyl amino alcohols (14 examples) has been prepared from the corresponding planar chiral ketones and evaluated as a new class of chiral ligands for asymmetric ethyl&#8208; and phenylzinc additions to aldehydes. The highly enantioselective synthesis of these ligands is facile, scalable, robust and relies on the use of cheaply available starting materials. Asymmetric ethyl additions proceeded smoothly at ambient temperature, with reaction times as short as 1&#8197;hour furnishing the desired products in up to 90&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee. The corresponding phenyl additions afforded products in up to 81&#8201;% yield and 88&#8201;% ee. The observed stereochemical outcome for the addition of diethylzinc was rationalized and the key proposed transition state was supported by an analysis of the X&#8208;ray structures of a series of amino alcohol ligands.

We describe the one&#8208;pot direct N&#8208;acylation of indazole with carboxylic acids using DMAPO/Boc2O system. This system is simple and provides N1&#8208;acyl indazoles in high yield with high N1 selectivities. This new method exhibits a wide substrate scope (&gt;40 examples). In addition, a new synthesis of N1&#8208;functionalized alkyl indazoles utilizing N1&#8208;acyl indazoles as starting materials was achieved.







Abstract
This report describes the one&#8208;pot direct N&#8208;acylation of indazole with carboxylic acids using our previously developed 4&#8208;(N,N&#8208;dimethylamino)pyridine N&#8208;oxide (DMAPO)/di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl dicarbonate (Boc2O) system. This simple system provides N1&#8208;acyl indazoles in high yield with high N1 selectivities and does not require the use of activated derivatives of carboxylic acids or high temperatures. This new method exhibits a wide substrate scope (&gt;40 examples). In addition, a new synthesis of N1&#8208;functionalized alkyl indazoles utilizing N1&#8208;acyl indazoles as starting materials was achieved. This stepwise protocol is useful for the selective synthesis of structurally diverse N1&#8208;functionalized alkyl indazoles, which are difficult to synthesize by other methods such as the Mitsunobu reaction and classical SN2 alkylation of indazole.

         <title>Decatungstate&#8208;Catalyzed Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Formation Between Furfural and Electron&#8208;Deficient Olefins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalization of furfural can be achieved by photocatalytic C&#8722;H activation of the aldehyde and coupling to electron&#8208;deficient olefins. With (Bu4N)4W10O32 as the photocatalyst, furfural can be added to benzylidene malononitriles, acrylates, itaconic anhydride, maleic anhydride, 2&#8208;vinylpyridine and phenyl vinyl sulfone to form the corresponding furanyl ketones in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields.







Abstract
Furfural is produced on a large commercial scale from lignocellulose and can be used for the preparation of several industrial chemicals with four to five carbon atoms. Further functionalization of furfural by C&#8722;H activation, however, is less widely developed. In the present work, tetrabutylammonium decatungstate is investigated as an inexpensive photocatalyst for activating the aldehyde C&#8722;H bond and mediate a coupling between furfural and electron&#8208;deficient olefins. The results show that furfural can be successfully added to benzylidene malononitriles, acrylates, itaconic anhydride, maleic anhydride, 2&#8208;vinylpyridine and phenyl vinyl sulfone to generate the corresponding furanyl ketones in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields. The electronic properties of the electron&#8208;deficient olefins are instrumental for achieving a favorable reaction with furfural. The findings show how photocatalysis can be used to form new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds from a platform molecule, which in this way can be converted into a number of more advanced structures.

         <title>Yttrium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydroamination of Norbornene with Simple Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydroamination of norbornene with simple amines remains a major challenge. Now the hydroamination of norbornene with such simple amines is reported, as well as the first rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of norbornenes.







Abstract
The intermolecular hydroamination of norbornene with simple amines was achieved using silyl&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;terphenoxide yttrium complexes. Excellent conversion was obtained for both benzylic and aliphatic amines. For benzyl and linear aliphatic amines, the highest activity was observed for the sterically more encumbered methyldiphenylsilyl&#8208;substituted complex, whereas the trimethylsilyl&#8208;substituted complex was more active for sterically encumbered primary amines.
