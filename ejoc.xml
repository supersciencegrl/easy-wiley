         <title>Trans&#8208;N&#8208;alkylation Covalent Exchanges on 1,3,4&#8208;Trisubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;Triazolium Iodides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,3,4&#8208;Trisubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium salts having either aliphatic or benzylic substituents at the N&#8208;1 and N&#8208;3 positions were synthesized in two steps involving: i) copper(I) catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition (CuAAC), and ii)N&#8208;alkylation of the 1,2,3&#8208;triazole intermediates. Trans&#8208;N&#8208;alkylation reactions in bulk and in the presence of excess methyl iodide were monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy for each 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium molecular model. By assigning the different formed species and their respective evolution with time, it was possible to conclude that trans&#8208;N&#8208;alkylation exchange reactions are significantly faster for benzylic substituents than for aliphatic ones. Furthermore, the exchange reactions are noticeably faster at the N&#8208;3 position than at the N&#8208;1 position most likely due to the steric hindrance induced by the neighboring C&#8208;4 substituent. The kinetics of trans&#8208;N&#8208;alkylation reactions are thus influenced by both the chemical nature of the N&#8208;1 and N&#8208;3 substituents and the regiochemistry of the 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium group. This provides important structural design rules to improve the properties of thermosetting covalent adaptable networks involving trans&#8208;N&#8208;alkylation of 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium salts.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;1,3,4-Trisubstituted 1,2,3-triazolium salts having either aliphatic or benzylic substituents at the N-1 and N-3 positions were synthesized in two steps involving: i) copper(I) catalyzed azide-alkyne 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (CuAAC), and ii)N-alkylation of the 1,2,3-triazole intermediates. Trans-N-alkylation reactions in bulk and in the presence of excess methyl iodide were monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy for each 1,2,3-triazolium molecular model. By assigning the different formed species and their respective evolution with time, it was possible to conclude that trans-N-alkylation exchange reactions are significantly faster for benzylic substituents than for aliphatic ones. Furthermore, the exchange reactions are noticeably faster at the N-3 position than at the N-1 position most likely due to the steric hindrance induced by the neighboring C-4 substituent. The kinetics of trans-N-alkylation reactions are thus influenced by both the chemical nature of the N-1 and N-3 substituents and the regiochemistry of the 1,2,3-triazolium group. This provides important structural design rules to improve the properties of thermosetting covalent adaptable networks involving trans-N-alkylation of 1,2,3-triazolium salts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthetic Routes to Imidates and Their Applications in Organic Transformation: Recent Progress</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidates are important organic intermediates used in several synthetic transformations towards N&#8208;heterocycles, natural products and metal complexes with a potential catalytic effect. Herein, the recent synthetic approaches and diverse applications of imidates were categorized and summarized. A wide range of organic compounds, mainly nitriles, isocyanides, amides, imines, and alkynes are used as starting materials. This review also summarizes the latest synthetic approaches to imidates that have been developed the recent years and some of their significant applications in the field of organic synthesis.







Abstract
Recent synthetic approaches and diverse applications of imidates are presented in this review. These motifs are successfully used as intermediates in organic transformations, such as the synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycles, natural products and metal complexes with a potential catalytic effect. Consequently, many attempts have been made for the development of efficient and facile synthetic methods of imidates in the past few years, as a continuum of previous paths. A wide range of organic compounds can be used as starting materials for these syntheses, including nitriles, isocyanides, amides etc. which through simple and flexible processes are converted to the desired imidates. Herein, an exploration of the recent synthetic routes of imidates and their diverse applications in organic transformations has been categorized and summarized.

         <title>2&#8208;(o&#8208;Tolyl)pyridine as ligand improves the efficiency in ketone directed ortho&#8208;arylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ketone directed ortho&#8208;arylation wherein the addition of a bidentate NC&#8208;type ligand, most effectively 2&#8208;(o&#8208;tolyl) pyridine, significantly enhances the C&#8208;H arylation reaction. Various aryl&#8208;alkyl ketones, including cyclic, aliphatic, and heterocyclic ones, are competent substrates, and arylboronic acid esters were used as aryl sources. However, substitution with OMe and CF3 in the aromatic ring of the ketone substrates is not tolerated, while such residues on the benzoic ester are possible. Notably, this study provides valuable insights into ketone&#8208;directed ortho arylation in the presence of 2&#8208;(o&#8208;tolyl) pyridine and adds additional options for catalyst and ligand optimization in ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Dearomatization of Chalcone&#8208;Based Quinolinium Salts to Assemble Bridged Quinobenzazepine Polycycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quinobenzazepines are useful in medicinal chemistry, but their synthesis is very challenging. Herein, we designed and synthesized a range of multi&#8208;functional chalcone&#8208;based quinolinium salts; their synthetic application in the rapid and straightforward construction of quinobenzazepines was successfully explored. A wide range of oxa&#8208;bridged quinobenzazepine polycycles were afforded serendipitously through a dearomative cascade reaction of our newly developed quinolinium salts and acetylacetone. This synthetic strategy features high bond&#8208; and ring&#8208;forming efficiency and complete regio&#8208; and diastereoselective control.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Applications of Sulfonium Salts as Aryl Radical Precursors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of aryl radicals as open&#8208;shelled intermediates has become an essential tool for both conventional and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthetic chemistry. However, the current methods for generating aryl radicals are still inefficient, greatly impeding their practical applications. Encouragingly, sulfonium salts have emerged as appealing sources of aryl radicals for a wide range of transformations aimed at creating novel chemical bonds driven by their distinctive structural attributes and chemical tendencies. This review primarily focuses on the specific reaction mechanisms underlying the cleavage of C&#8208;S bonds in sulfonium salts, leading to the generation of corresponding aryl radicals within diverse reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>DBS&#8208;Based Eutectogels: Organized Vessels to Perform the Michael Addition Reaction
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 35, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramaolecular eutectogels were used as reaction &#8220;vessel&#8221; to perform the Michael addition reaction. Data collected allowed to identify the relationship between structural features of soft materials and catalytic activity.







Abstract
Supramolecular eutectogels were obtained from the gelation of 1,3&#8201;:&#8201;2,4&#8208;dibenzylidene&#8208;D&#8208;sorbitol (DBS) in cholinium chloride&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents (DES), differing for the nature of the hydrogen bond donor. Ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, glycerol and urea were tested. Soft materials were fully characterized, determining critical gelation concentration, gel&#8208;sol transition temperatures and mechanical properties. Furthermore, to have information about the organization of the gelator in the tridimensional network, resonance light scattering, circular dichroism and microscopy investigations were performed. Eutectogels were used as organized &#8220;vessels&#8221; to perform the L&#8208;proline catalyzed Michael addition reaction. The probe reaction was carried out in gel phase and in DES solution. Data collected shed light on the effect that gel microenvironment exerts on the outcome of the reaction. In general, gel phases allowed having comparable or even better results than the ones collected in DES solution, with better results obtained in soft materials with the highest organization, as accounted for by the presence of larger aggregates and the occurrence of stronger intermolecular interactions. In turn, this accounts also for the effect of substrates structure that indicates that better yields could be obtained in the presence of more flexible nucleophile and dienones, having more extended &#960;&#8208;surface.

         <title>Quantifying the Electronic Effect of C4 and C4&#8242; Positions of Bipyridine Ligand on Pd(II)/Rh(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Conjugate Addition Reaction: A DFT Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 35, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study screens a parameter Mayer bond order which can quantitatively describe the electronic effects of 4 and 4&#8242; positions on each side of the bipyridine ligands for activation energy barrier of insertion step in Pd(II)/Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed conjugate addition reactions. The dominant &#963;&#8208;donation of ligand to Pd(II) and the dominant &#8220;&#960;&#8208;back donation&#8221; of Rh(I) to ligand are the main reason for the opposite trends of correlation between the activation energy barrier with Mayer bond order on the ligand&#8208;Pd(II)/Rh(I).







Abstract
The electronic effects of the bidentate ligands play a vital role in the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed conjugate addition reactions. Here, the insertion step (rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) of the conjugate addition) catalyzed by Pd(II)/Rh(I)&#8208;complexes with 26&#8197;bipyridine&#8208;type (bpy) ligands linking different substituent groups in the opposite sides (C4, C4&#8242; position) are systematically studied by density functional theory (DFT). It is found that for both Pd(II)&#8208; and Rh(I)&#8208;catalysis, the stronger the electron&#8208;withdrawing group connecting to both C4 and C4&#8242; positions of bpy ligands can promote the insertion step. The predominance of &#960;&#8208;back donation in Rh(I) and &#963;&#8208;donation in Pd(II) is the main reason for above different electronic properties of Pd(II) and Rh(I)&#8208;catalysis. This work gives enough theoretical guide to the rational design of the efficient transition metal&#8208;based catalyst for conjugate addition.

         <title>Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH)&#8208;Mediated Oxidative Hydroxylation of Arylboronic Acids and Its Applications in C&#8208;O Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 35, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a facile methodology for the transformation of arylboronic acids into phenols through NaOH&#8208;mediated air oxidation. The reaction involves the transmetalation of the resulting borate ester with NaOH, facilitating the direct derivatization of the resulting ArONa into aryl ethers and esters using alkyl and acyl halides. This approach offers a straightforward and efficient route to diversify the synthesized compounds.







Abstract
We have developed a straightforward methodology for converting arylboronic acids into phenols using NaOH&#8208;mediated air oxidation. This reaction offers several advantages, including simple operation, excellent tolerance towards various functional groups, and scalability. The transmetalation of the resulting borate ester with NaOH occurs readily, enabling convenient derivatization of the borate ester into aryl ethers and esters using alkyl and acyl halides.

         <title>Synthesis of Soluble Quinacridone Photocatalysts for the Homogeneous Oxidation of Thioethers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 35, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, quinacridone (QA) functionalization with EWG groups and N&#8208;alkylation is described, in order to improve QA solubility and photocatalytic oxidizing activity. The synthesized derivatives acted as efficient photocatalysts in the selective aerobic oxidation of thioethers to sulfoxides. Remarkably, N,N&#8217;&#8208;dibutyl&#8208;quinacridone (DBQA) showed the best performances, leading to quantitative thioanisole conversion to sulfoxide in 20 minutes.







Abstract
Evaluation of quinacridone (QA) derivatives as homogeneous metal&#8208;free photocatalysts is here presented. QA derivatives were synthetized and systematically characterized, measuring their ground state and excited state redox potentials in dichloromethane (DCM) and 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP), in order to understand how structural modifications influenced their photocatalytic properties. In particular, the effect of dicyanomethylene and nitro EWG groups was investigated, in order to develop a photocatalyst capable of promoting oxidative processes in the presence of molecular oxygen. Among the analyzed derivatives, 2,9&#8208;dinitro&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;dibutylquinacridone (DNDBQA) was the one with the highest excited state reduction potential (Ered*=1.60&#8197;V in HFIP vs SCE), while N,N&#8217;&#8208;dibutylquinacridone (DBQA) showed valuable excited state redox potentials (Ered*=1.29&#8197;V; Eox*=&#8722;1.28&#8197;V in HFIP vs SCE), making it suitable for bimodal applications in oxidative and reductive photocatalytic processes. Afterwards, the synthetized QA derivatives were examined as photocatalysts to promote the selective aerobic oxidation of thioether to sulfoxide. Promising results in thioanisole oxidation were achieved with all the QA derivatives tested as photocatalysts, in terms of yield and selectivity. Remarkably, DBQA showed the best performances, catalyzing the reaction in only 20 minutes, using 0.5&#8201;% of the photocatalyst, and showing excellent performances in the oxidation of several thioether derivatives.

         <dc:description>
The enantio and diastereoselective synthesis of vinyl cyclopentenols by a Heck reaction was accomplished. It features the use of chiral N,N&#8208;ligands, and a delicate balance of non&#8208;covalent interactions of the cationic palladium complex with the nucleophilic oxygen group of the substrates. VCD played a critical role to establish the relative and the absolute stereochemistry of the Heck products.







Abstract
This work describes an effective method to obtain chiral vinyl cyclopentenols with a high degree of enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity through Heck desymmetrization of cyclopent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethanol using vinyl triflates as coupling agents and chiral N,N ligands. This Heck vinylation protocol allowed the synthesis of several structurally complex cyclopentenols in isolated yields of up to 80&#8201;% in enantiomeric ratios of up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3 and diastereoselectivities higher than 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 in most cases. Experiments using (E) or (Z) vinyl triflates, and desymmetrization of protected olefin 1&#8208;(cyclopent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethoxy)&#8208;4&#8208;nitrobenzene (17) were instrumental in rationalizing the observed diastereoselectivities of Heck products involving the interaction of vinyl triflate carbonyl and the hydroxyl group moiety of the substrate with the cationic Pd(II) complex. The absolute configuration of the vinylated Heck products was determined by Vibrational Circular Dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 35, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical protocol for a practical and direct method for the electron&#8208;deficient C(sp2)&#8722;H Ritter&#8208;type amination under mild conditions was developed. This method is characterized by inexpensive and easily accessible regents, atom and step economy. With moderate to good yields, this useful and simple process produces a number of acetanilides from simple electron&#8208;deficient arenes, including mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;substituted arenes.







Abstract
Due to the high oxidation potentials of electron&#8208;deficient aromatic hydrocarbons, it is difficult to achieve the direct oxidative C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds functionalizations of such substrates. Herein, we develop a Ritter&#8208;type amination of electron&#8208;deficient aromatics by merging electricity and sulfate. This practical and straightforward method provides a series of acetanilides from simple electron&#8208;deficient arenes, including mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted arenes (22&#8197;examples, up to 75&#8201;%) with moderate to good yields under mild conditions. This method is characterized by cheap and readily available regents, atom and step economy.

         <title>Lateral Deprotometallation&#8208;Trapping Reactions on Methylated Pyridines, Quinolines and Quinoxalines Using Lithium Diethylamide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 35, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The behavior of methylated heterocycles (picolines, 2,4&#8208;lutidine, methylquinolines and 2&#8208;methylquinoxaline) in deprotometallation&#8208;trapping sequences using lithium diethylamide was studied.







Abstract
The functionalization of methylated azines and diazines has aroused the interest of chemists given the structural diversity that it affords. Hindered lithium dialkylamides have been used to deprotometallate these substrates chemoselectively. In contrast, it can be observed that, despite some promising work, lithium diethylamide has been used very little for this purpose. Our objective here is on the one hand to make an inventory of what reagents have been used to deprotometallate methylpyridines, &#8208;quinolines and &#8208;quinoxalines, and on the other hand to describe the results obtained by seeking to functionalize a series of substrates with lithium diethylamide (picolines, 2,4&#8208;lutidine, methylquinolines and 2&#8208;methylquinoxaline). Our efforts to take advantage of the use of an in&#8208;situ trap (a zinc chloride chelate) in these reactions are also described.

One central building block: A versatile synthesis of several seven&#8208;membered heterocyclic ring systems is described. Key steps of our approach are the iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidative C&#8722;C homocoupling of diarylamines to 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(arylamino)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biaryls and their subsequent condensation with 1,1&#8208;dielectrophiles to 6,7&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[d,f][1,3]diazepines, 5,7&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[d,f][1,3]diazepinones, and 5,7&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[c,e][1,2,7]thiadiazepine 6&#8208;oxides.







Abstract
The iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidative C&#8722;C homocoupling of diarylamines affords 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(arylamino)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biaryls which represent crucial synthetic building blocks for an access to a range of seven&#8208;membered heterocyclic ring systems. Reaction with paraformaldehyde, diphenyl carbonate, and diphenyl sulfite as efficient 1,1&#8208;dielectrophiles led to dibenzo[d,f][1,3]diazepines, dibenzo[d,f][1,3]diazepinones, and dibenzo[c,e][1,2,7]thiadiazepine 6&#8208;oxides. The synthetic procedures enable short and practical routes to these 1,3&#8208;diazepine derivatives under mild reaction conditions and with a high tolerance of various functional groups.

         <title>Pd(II)/Lewis Acid Catalyzed Intramolecular Oxidative C&#8722;H Amination to Construct Carbazoles with Dioxygen</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 35, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd(II)/LA catalyst was explored for intramolecular oxidative C&#8722;H amination reaction of 2&#8208;acetaminobiphenyls to construct carbazoles with O2 as the sole oxidant. The mechanistic studies supported that the C&#8722;H activation by Pd(II) was a reversible step and the palladacycle intermediate was identified through 1H&#8197;NMR characterizations.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed oxidative C&#8722;H amination reactions are among the most attractive topics in organic synthesis to construct nitrogen&#8208;containing motifs. The challenge is that most of these reactions employed stoichiometric oxidants to achieve satisfied catalytic efficiencies. Herein, we report a Pd(II)/LA&#8208;catalyzed (LA: Lewis acid) oxidative C&#8722;H amination reaction of 2&#8208;acetaminobiphenyls to construct carbazoles by using dioxygen balloon as the sole oxidant source, and the presence of LA sharply improved the catalytic efficiency of Pd(OAc)2. Remarkably, in certain cases, the deacetylation of the annulation product happened under standard conditions to afford free carbazoles as the final product. The H/D exchange studies confirmed the reversibility of C&#8722;H activation and also disclosed multiple C&#8722;H activation sites by using &#8722;NAc and &#8722;NTs as the directing groups. In addition, the palladacycle compound was identified through 1H&#8197;NMR characterizations and proved to be the intermediate prior to the carbazole formation.

         <title>A Highly Sterically Congested Bis&#8208;Zinc&#8208;Porphyrin Containing a Single Buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyne Linkage: From a Serendipitous Finding to Supramolecular Encapsulation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 35, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two zinc&#8208;porphyrin moieties have been covalently attached through a single, rigid buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyne linkage placed at the ortho position of a meso phenyl ring. Despite of freely rotating around the bis&#8208;alkyne axle, such species is adaptable enough to encapsulate a DABCO molecule with a high association constant (K&gt;106&#8197;M&#8722;1) as supported by in&#8208;depth experimental and computational studies.







Abstract
A unique example of a bis&#8208;zinc&#8208;porphyrin chemical system in which both macrocycles are covalently connected with a single, short buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyne linkage placed at the ortho sites of the meso phenyl rings is presented. This dimeric compound resulted from an homo&#8208;coupling side&#8208;reaction taking place during a copper&#8208;catalyzed click reaction between an alkyne porphyrin and 2&#8208;azidopyridine derivatives. Its unexpected formation was rationalized by control experiments and an improved synthesis was achieved under copper&#8208;catalyzed Glaser&#8208;Hay coupling reaction conditions. This highly sterically congested bis&#8208;zinc&#8208;porphyrin derivative behaved as a supramolecular host for encapsulating ditopic molecular guests such as 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) with association constant K1.1 in the order of 106&#8197;M&#8722;1. This value is comparable to current systems that typically feature several connecting linkages between the two zinc&#8208;porphyrin sites resulting in (supra)molecular cages ensuring a high pre&#8208;organization. As such, the requirements to take benefit from supramolecular encapsulation can be reduced to a highly rigid, minimal covalent linkage of four atoms between zinc&#8208;porphyrins as herein described.

Despite of freely rotating around the bis-alkyne axle, such species is adaptable enough to encapsulate a DABCO molecule with a high association constant (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;&amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) as supported by in-depth experimental and computational studies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A unique example of a bis-zinc-porphyrin chemical system in which both macrocycles are covalently connected with a single, short buta-1,3-diyne linkage placed at the &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt; sites of the &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt; phenyl rings is presented. This dimeric compound resulted from an homo-coupling side-reaction taking place during a copper-catalyzed click reaction between an alkyne porphyrin and 2-azidopyridine derivatives. Its unexpected formation was rationalized by control experiments and an improved synthesis was achieved under copper-catalyzed Glaser-Hay coupling reaction conditions. This highly sterically congested bis-zinc-porphyrin derivative behaved as a supramolecular host for encapsulating ditopic molecular guests such as 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) with association constant &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1.1&lt;/sub&gt; in the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This value is comparable to current systems that typically feature several connecting linkages between the two zinc-porphyrin sites resulting in (supra)molecular cages ensuring a high pre-organization. As such, the requirements to take benefit from supramolecular encapsulation can be reduced to a highly rigid, minimal covalent linkage of four atoms between zinc-porphyrins as herein described.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Direct C&#8722;H Halogenation of N&#8208;Heteroarenes and Naphthols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 35, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we introduce an environmentally friendly and highly efficient electrochemical method for regioselective C&#8722;H halogenation of (hetero)arenes, achieving moderate to excellent yields in an undivided cell. This approach demonstrates remarkable performance across a wide range of substrates.







Abstract
In this study, we present a straightforward and environmentally friendly electrochemical approach for achieving selective halogenation of N&#8208;heteroarenes, including indoles, diazoles, pyrroles, quinolinone, and naphthols. Our method utilizes commercially available and affordable ammonium halides as halogen source. A library of valuable halogenated N&#8208;heteroarenes can be synthesized in moderate to excellent yields under mild conditions (transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, oxidant&#8208;free, ethanol as solvent, atmospheric environment). The approach demonstrates a broad substrate scope, excellent tolerance towards various functional groups, and scalability.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Cyclobutene&#8208;Annulated Fullerenes through a Cascade Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 35, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step method was developed to produce cyclobutenofullerenes via the reaction of fullerene C60 with secondary propargylic phosphates. The reaction cascade comprised the 1,3&#8208;migration of the propargylic phosphate to form an allene intermediate followed by a formal [2+2] cycloaddition with C60, and the subsequent 1,3&#8208;migration and 1,2&#8208;elimination of the phosphodiester moiety.







Abstract
The physicochemical properties of fullerene&#8208;based materials typically vary depending on the type and mode of addition of functional groups; therefore, developing fullerene derivatives with novel structures is imperative for further progress in materials science. In this study, we develop an efficient one&#8208;step strategy for synthesizing cyclobutene&#8208;annulated fullerene derivatives (cyclobutenofullerenes) and characterize their electronic properties. Despite the steric strain, cyclobutenofullerenes can be easily prepared via a one&#8208;step reaction of C60 with a secondary propargylic phosphate. Structural analysis of the reaction intermediates suggests that the cascade reaction proceeds through a formal [2+2] cycloaddition of C60 with an allene, caused by the 1,3&#8208;migration of the propargylic phosphate, followed by an additional 1,3&#8208;migration and the subsequent 1,2&#8208;elimination of the phosphodiester moiety.

Abstract
A Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction of indolizines with 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones catalyzed by B(C6F5)3 is described. This protocol gives access to indolizine derivatives that are valuable building blocks in synthetic and pharmaceutical chemistry. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, affording various C2&#8208;quaternary indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones based on indolizine with high yields and regioselectivities. Moreover, the synthetic transformations of the target products were realized by N&#8208;methylation and trifluoromethane sulfonation.

         <title>Oxidation of 3&#8208;Oxo&#8208;N&#8208;Confused Porphyrin with PIFA: Inner and meso Functionalizations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 35, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugate addition of ethanol to 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;N&#8208;confused tetraphenylporphyrin (ONCP) and subsequent oxidation by [bis (trifluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene (PIFA) lead to the formation of mono&#8208; and di&#8208;ethoxylated ONCP. Interestingly, swapping the addition order of ethanol and PIFA, N&#8208;confused phlorins were obtained.







Abstract
Conjugate addition of ethanol and subsequent oxidation with [bis (trifluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene (PIFA) allowed for the inner ethoxylation of 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;N&#8208;confused tetraphenylporphyrin (ONCP). First oxidation of ONCP with PIFA followed by treatment with ethanol gave two more N&#8208;confused phlorins derivatives 5 and 6.

         <dc:description>
Switchable synthesis of 7&#8208; and 14&#8208;membered cyclic peptides containing non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids was achieved. This is the first report that describes the synthesis of smaller cyclic N&#8208;methylated peptides via dimerization&#8208;cyclization strategy.







Abstract
Smaller cyclic peptides containing non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids have garnered much attention for use as drugs, but their chemical synthesis is extremely challenging. In this study, a rapid (60.5&#8197;min) synthesis of 7&#8208; and 14&#8208;membered cyclic peptides containing N&#8208;methyl&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;amino acids was achieved by only switching the concentrations (0.20&#8197;M or 0.01&#8197;M) of the substrates. The developed approach required neither expensive transition&#8208;metals nor expensive coupling agents. As far as we could ascertain, this is the first report of the synthesis of smaller (&#8804;16&#8208;membered) cyclic N&#8208;methylated peptides via dimerization&#8208;cyclization strategy.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Alkynyl Thioamides: An Efficient Thioacylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 35, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient protocol was developed for the preparation of a variety of alkynyl thioamides starting from tetraalkyl thiuram compounds (TMTM, TIBTM) and alkynes in CuI/Cs2CO3 system. This method features inexpensive starting materials, good to excellent yields and easy operation, illustrating its potential synthetic value for the synthesis of thioamides and their derivatives.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed efficient synthesis of alkynyl thioamides starting from tetraalkyl thiuram compounds (TMTM: tetramethyl thiuram monosulfide, TIBTM: tetraisobutyl thiuram monosulfide) and alkynes was reported. Thus, tetraalkyl thiurams reacted with alkynes smoothly, giving a variety of alkynyl thioamides promoted by CuI/Cs2CO3 system. This protocol features easy operation, inexpensive starting materials and good yields, illustrating its potential synthetic value for the synthesis of thioamides and their derivatives.

The Front Cover shows the ability of a bis&#8208;zinc&#8208;porphyrin made by a small four carbon atoms linkage to be adaptable enough to engage in a close versus open form. This behavior was exploited in the selective encapsulation of one or two guest molecules depending on the nature of the guest and study conditions. Cover design by K. Kupietz.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches to &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, and &#948;&#8208;Lycoranes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 35, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review compiles the current synthetic approaches toward lycoranes. Particularly, all those synthetic approaches gave access to &#945;&#8208;lycorane (19&#8197;routes), &#946;&#8208;lycorane (10&#8197;routes), &#947;&#8208;lycorane (38&#8197;routes), and &#948;&#8208;lycorane (6&#8197;routes), with 15&#8197;different routes reporting asymmetric total synthesis, mainly taking advantage of organocatalysts and transition metals.







Abstract
Lycorane is a pentacyclic core presented in alkaloids isolated from the Amaryllidaceae family of herbaceous flowering plants. Members of this class of natural products have shown to display important biological properties including analgesic, antiviral, and antiproliferative activities. This review presents the known synthetic routes toward &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, and &#948;&#8208;lycoranes. &#945;&#8208;(19&#8197;routes), &#946;&#8208;(10&#8197;routes), &#947;&#8208;(38&#8197;routes), and &#948;&#8208;(6&#8197;routes).

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Iminosugar&#8208;C&#8208;Glycosides through Addition of Organometallic Reagents to N&#8208;tert&#8208;Butanesulfinyl Glycosylamines: A Comprehensive Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive study of the preparation and reactivity of N&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl glycosylamines with simple Grignard and organo lithium reagents is reported. As they readily react as latent imine equivalents with a variety of carbon nucleophiles in batch and continuous flow chemistry, these carbohydrate derivatives constitute very useful precursors for the diastereoselective synthesis of bioactive compounds such as iminosugar&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides.







Abstract
A comprehensive study of the preparation and reactivity of N&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl glycosylamines with simple Grignard and organo lithium reagents in batch vs. continuous flow chemistry is reported. As they readily react as latent imine equivalents with a variety of carbon nucleophiles, these carbohydrate derivatives constitute very useful precursors for the diastereoselective synthesis of bioactive compounds such as iminosugar&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides. A hybrid protocol, involving the addition of benzylmagnesium chloride to a (SR)&#8208;arabinofuranosylamine substrate in flow, at room temperature, combined with a cyclization protocol in batch is also described for the first time. Of note, this semi&#8208;continuous flow process shortens the synthesis of imino&#8208;C&#8208;glycoside scaffolds to a single workday.

A hybrid protocol, involving the addition of benzylmagnesium chloride to a (S&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;)-arabinofuranosylamine substrate in flow, at room temperature, combined with a cyclization protocol in batch is also described for the first time. Of note, this semi-continuous flow process shortens the synthesis of imino-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-glycoside scaffolds to a single workday.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lewis Acid Catalysed Chemoselective Amination of Alcohols Using Heterocyclic Thiones: An Avenue to Thiotetrazole Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the development of a Cu(OTf)2 catalysed chemoselective amination of alcohols using heterocyclic thiones is described. Notably, the method is additive, ligand or inert atmosphere free and shows good tolerance towards variety of alcohols and thiotetrazole derivatives affording good to excellent yields of the product.







Abstract
Herein,a protocol for the chemoselective formation of C&#8722;N bond using Cu(OTf)2 as catalyst has been described using heterocyclic thiones. The reaction occurs preferentially at the nitrogen centre over the sulphur atom leading to C&#8722;N bond formation. Water being the only by&#8208;product, the reaction is environmentally friendly. The reaction proceeds without any additive, ligand or inert atmosphere and shows good tolerance towards variety of alcohols and thiotetrazole derivatives. Our developed protocol could be scaled up to gram scale efficiently, which highlights the efficacy of this method and might offer potential application in synthetic industry.

         <title>Access to Electron&#8208;Rich Dibenzofurans through NBu4OAc Mediated Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:&#160;Dibenzofuran and its derivatives are ubiquitous and important medicinal and natural products. Many contain electron&#8208;rich aryl rings. Forming the key intramolecular Ar&#8211;Ar bond using traditional cross&#8208;coupling is difficult. The C&#8211;H functionalisation (C&#8211;H activation) approach is, in principle, far more useful. However, we previously found that the well&#8208;established conditions, which promote C&#8211;H functionalisation through Concerted Metalation&#8208;Deprotonation (CMD), proved unsatisfactory. Herein, we report a Pd&#8208;catalysed C&#8211;H functionalisation protocol that works with electron&#8208;rich arenes. We use tetrabutylammonium acetate (NBu4OAc), which we suspect can act as base, ligand and solvent, rendering this protocol a simple and efficient route to electron&#8208;rich dibenzofurans.</dc:description>

         <title>C,N&#8208;Diarylformamidines as Valuable Building Blocks in the Synthesis of Heterocyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review is devoted to the heterocyclization of C,N&#8208;diarylformamidines and covers publications from 1999 to 2022. The comprehensive information collected enables other researchers to quickly understand the possibility of constructing various complex heterocycles from simple, readily available reagents.







Abstract
Obtaining highly functionalized heterocyclic structures is an important topic of modern organic synthesis, as it reveals the possibility of constructing more complex systems and therefore, expanding the range of various drugs. Aiming at synthesizing complex molecules from simple and readily available reagents, the modification of C,N&#8208;diarylformamidines, well known in medicinal chemistry, is of great interest. This article reviews comprehensively the field of C,N&#8208;diarylformamidine chemistry and covers publications on this topic from 1999 to 2022.

         <title>PPh3&#8208;Mediated Nucleophilic Sulfonation of Sulfonyl Chlorides with Arynes: Access to Manifold Aryl Sulfones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel PPh3&#8208;mediated nucleophilic sulfonation of sulfonyl chlorides with arynes has been demonstrated. This protocol exhibits broad functional group tolerance and provides a direct approach to a variety of aryl and alkyl sulfones.







Abstract
Sulfonyl chlorides are a class of cheap and readily available basic chemicals, which have routinely served as electrophilic reagents in their chemical transformations. Herein, we disclose a novel PPh3&#8208;mediated nucleophilic sulfonation method of sulfonyl chlorides with arynes. Different from the classical P(III)&#8208;mediated reductive deoxygenation reaction of sulfonyl chlorides, the valence state of the sulfur atom has not been changed. This protocol exhibits broad functional group tolerance and provides a direct approach to a variety of aryl and alkyl sulfones.

         <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO) is known as a highly electron&#8208;donative ligand, but its application to metal catalysts has rarely been studied.

These synthesized [(NHO)PdCl(&#956;&#8208;Cl)]2 complexes had a phosphine co&#8208;ligand that proved effective as a catalyst for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling at ambient temperature.

         <title>Meta&#8208;Ortho Effect on the Excited State Pathways of Chloroanilines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct excitation of aromatic compounds grants access to high&#8208;energy intermediates that can be utilised in organic synthesis. Understanding and predicting the substituent effects at the excited state for aromatic molecules remains challenging for the synthetic photochemist. In this work, we present an experimental and computational investigation of the excited state of the isomeric chloroanilines, which promptly react by losing the chloride when the amino group is in para position, but are non&#8208;reactive and non&#8208;emissive in the meta and ortho isomers. XMS&#8208;CASPT2//CASSCF computations explain this apparent contradiction of the meta&#8208;ortho selectivity rule of Zimmerman, which originates from the substituent effects lowering to a different extent the barrier to populate the prefulvenic conical intersection that deactivates non&#8208;radiatively the singlet excited state of the chloroanilines.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling between Two Different Tosylates Enabled by Nickel/Palladium Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cross&#8208;electrophile coupling reactions are efficient for the construction of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds under relatively mild conditions, and hence widely used for making new molecules. Among various electrophiles, the cross&#8208;electrophile coupling reaction between two different tosylates has been rarely studied. Herein, we present a cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenyl tosylate (C(sp2)&#8208;OTs) and &#945;&#8208;CF3 benzyl tosylate (C(sp3)&#8208;OTs) by nickel/palladium cooperative catalysis.

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of phenanthridinones and carbazoles by intramolecular photo&#8208; and Base&#8208;promoted Homolityc Aromatic Substitution photo&#8208;BHAS) reaction from N&#8208;(2&#8208;halobenzyl)&#8208;N&#8208;methylanilines or N&#8208;substituted&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl anilines is presented. The synthetic protocol uses only KOtBu and DMSO to generate aryl radicals under visible&#8208;light irradiation. An exciplex complex between the substrates and the dimsyl anion could be involved in the initiation step.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven approach towards phenanthridin&#8208;6(5H)&#8208;one and carbazole rings synthesis under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions is here reported. Phenanthridinones and carbazoles are synthesized through an intramolecular arylation of the corresponding N&#8208;(2&#8208;halobenzyl)&#8208;N&#8208;methylanilines or N&#8208;substituted&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl anilines using KOtBu as base in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at room temperature (rt), employing blue light emitting diodes (LEDs) as the light source. The reaction proceeds through photo&#8208; and base&#8208;promoted homolytic aromatic substitution via photoinduced electron transfer mechanism and it exhibits good tolerance to different functional groups, resulting in good to very good yields (up to 86&#8201;%).

         <title>Tumor Carbohydrate Associated Antigen Analogs as Potential Binders for Siglec&#8208;7</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding recognition of two structurally constrained sialyl derivatives by Siglec&#8208;7was investigated. The flexibility of Siglec&#8208;7 loops allowed the preferred accommodation of the more rigid compound containing a biphenyl moiety. Our results set the basis for the design and development of novel compounds as potential modulators for Siglec&#8208;7.







Abstract
We investigated two recently synthesized and characterized sialyl derivatives, bearing the Neu5Ac&#8208;&#945;&#8208;(2&#8208;6)&#8208;Gal epitope, as promising binders for Siglec&#8208;7, an inhibitory Siglec mainly found on natural killer cells. A variety of sialoglycan structures can be recognized by Siglec&#8208;7 with implications in the modulation of immune responses. Notably, overexpression of sialylated glycans recognized by Siglec&#8208;7 can be associated with the progression of several tumors, including melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. NOE&#8208;based NMR techniques, including Saturation Transfer Difference and transferred&#8208;NOESY NMR, together with molecular docking and dynamic simulations were combined to shed light on the molecular basis of Siglec&#8208;7 recognition of two conformationally constrained Sialyl&#8208;Tn antigen analogs. We, therefore, identify the ligands epitope mapping and their conformational features and propose 3D models accurately describing the protein&#8208;ligand complexes. We found that the binding site of Siglec&#8208;7 can accommodate both synthetic analogs, with the sialic acid mainly involved in the interaction. Moreover, the flexibility of Siglec&#8208;7 loops allows a preferred accommodation of the more rigid compound bearing a biphenyl moiety at position 9 of the sialic acid that contributed to the interaction to a large extent. Our findings provided insights for developing potential novel high affinity ligands for Siglec&#8208;7 to hinder tumor evasion.

         <title>Magnetic Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Organic Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic circularly polarized luminescence (MCPL) is the phenomenon through which non&#8208;chiral compound emit circularly polarized light under a magnetic field. Potentialities and limitations of MCPL from organic compounds are discussed.







Abstract
Achiral purely organic molecules can show selectivity towards circularly polarized light in emission in the presence of a magnetic field. This phenomenon is called magnetic circularly polarized luminescence (MCPL). Recently a few examples of MCPL from organic molecules have appeared in the literature. Through this technique, interesting photophysical information can be inferred and, moreover, a few technological applications can be devised based on this principle. This short review has the purpose to give a general introduction to this recent field of research and some critical insights on the reported examples.

         <title>Facile Stereoselective Synthesis and Structural Study of Camphor and Fenchone Based Spirocyclic 1,3,4&#8208;Oxadiazolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the first time, an effective method for the synthesis of spirocyclic camphor and fenchone based 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazolines has been developed. The influence of the molecular structure of the terpene substrate on the reaction stereoselectivity was studied. The structural features of the target products were studied using NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The proposed method allows obtaining of spirocyclic products with a wide structural diversity, stereoselectively and in good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Defluoroborylation of 3,3&#8208;Difluoropropenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The defluorinative functionalization of allylic fluorides represents an attractive approach for the preparation of molecules containing a monofluoroalkene core. In that sense, introducing a &#8220;boryl nucleophile&#8221; is a powerful strategy to obtain polyvalent borylated intermediates as versatile synthetic precursors. To perform this reaction without the use of transition metals, the nucleophilic character of a diborane/fluoride system was exploited in a SN2&#8242; type&#8208;substitution reaction of gem&#8208;difluoropropenes to install a pinacolborane group. The use of HMDS as a silylated additive is necessary to improve the reactivity. A direct oxidation of the intermediate boronates allowed the isolation of the corresponding &#946;&#8208;fluoroallyl alcohols in low to good yields (9&#8722;81%). Other synthetic transformations of a (2&#8208;fluoroallyl)boronate are also illustrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Distinct Heterocyclic Moieties Govern the Selectivity of Thiophene&#8208;Vinylene&#8208;Based Ligands Towards A&#946; or Tau Pathology in Alzheimer&#180;s Disease</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Distinct aggregated proteins are correlated with numerous neurodegenerative diseases and the development of ligands that selectively detect these pathological hallmarks is vital. Recently, the synthesis of thiophene&#8208;based optical ligands, denoted bi&#8208;thiophenevinyl&#8208;benzothiazoles (bTVBTs), that could be utilized for selective assignment of tau pathology in brain tissue with Alzheimer&#180;s disease (AD) pathology, was reported. Herein, we investigate the ability of these ligands to selectively distinguish tau deposits from aggregated amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;), the second AD associated pathological hallmark, when replacing the terminal thiophene moiety with other heterocyclic motifs. The selectivity for tau pathology was reduced when introducing specific heterocyclic motifs, verifying that specific molecular interactions between the ligands and the aggregates are necessary for selective detection of tau deposits. In addition, ligands having certain heterocyclic moieties attached to the central thiophene&#8208;vinylene&#8208;building block displayed selectivity to aggregated A&#946; pathology. Our findings provide chemical insights for the development of ligands that can distinguish between aggregated proteinaceous species
consisting of different proteins and might also aid in creating novel agents for clinical imaging of tau pathology in AD.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A concise and efficient enantiospecific total synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;hyacinthacine A1 and (+)&#8208;hyacinthacine A1 was achieved from commercially available starting material L&#8208;pyroglutamic acid and D&#8208;glutamic acid, respectively. For the synthesis of this trihydroxylated pyrrolizidine ring, we employed the nitrogen&#8208;substituted donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane as a key intermediate. The synthetic approach relies on two crucial steps, highly stereo&#8208; and regioselective intramolecular cyclopropanation with Rh2(OAc)4 and regioselective ring opening of a nitrogen&#8208;substituted donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane.</dc:description>

         <title>An Unexpected Synthesis of Crowded Triphenylenes</title>

However, when 2,5&#8208;dibromothiophene&#8208;1,1&#8208;dioxide (6) was heated with tetracyclone, the chief product was 1,2,3,4,6,7,8&#8208;heptaphenyltriphenylene (14). Similarly, when compound 6 was heated with acecyclone (15), the product was 11,18,20&#8208;triphenyldiacenaphtho[a,h]triphenylene (16). Both 14 and 16 have been characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography.

         <dc:description>
The ring&#8208;opening of cyclic sulfamidates and sulfates with &#945;&#8208;fluorocarbanion generated from fluorobis(phenylsulfonyl)methane (FBSM) and subsequent reductive desulfonylation have been developed. This fluoromethylation approach allows access to &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;fluoroamines as well as &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;fluoroalcohols in high yields. The monofluoromethylation of cyclic sulfamidates with &#945;&#8208;fluorocarbanion of ethyl 2&#8208;fluoroacetoacetate was also described.







Abstract
A regioselective fluoromethylation by ring&#8208;opening of cyclic sulfamidates and sulfates with &#945;&#8208;fluorocarbanions and subsequent reductive desulfonylation is developed. Fluorobis(phenylsulfonyl)methane (FBSM) was explored as fluoromethide equivalent and the reaction was extended to the &#945;&#8208;fluorocarbanion of ethyl 2&#8208;fluoroacetoacetate. This approach allows access to &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;fluoroamines as well as &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;fluoroalcohols in high yields.

&lt;p&gt;The ring-opening of cyclic sulfamidates and sulfates with &#945;-fluorocarbanion generated from fluorobis(phenylsulfonyl)methane (FBSM) and subsequent reductive desulfonylation have been developed.

         <title>Trichloromethylative Olefin Lactonization by Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trichloromethylative olefin lactonization was reported. A photoredox iridium catalyst irradiated with blue LEDs promoted the reaction without using hazardous reagents. The mechanistic studies were performed by experimental and theoretical means. The trichloromethyl moiety of the product could be converted to the corresponding dichloroalkene and chloroalkyne in addition to the carboxyl group.







Abstract
A trichloromethylative olefin lactonization reaction using an iridium photoredox catalyst was developed. The reactions proceeded at room temperature for olefins with various substituents and substitution patterns, and a variety of lactones with a tetrasubstituted carbon and trichloromethyl group were obtained regio&#8208; and stereoselectively. The reaction mechanism was elucidated through isotope labeling experiments. The chemical properties of the lactones containing the trichloromethyl groups were investigated, and synthetic transformations of the product were realized.

         <title>Use of Formic Acid as a CO Surrogate for the Reduction of Nitroarenes in the Presence of Dienes: A Two&#8208;Step Synthesis of N&#8208;Arylpyrroles via 1,2&#8208;Oxazines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formic acid was employed as a CO surrogate to deoxygenate nitroarenes to nitrosoarenes, a reaction catalyzed by a palladium/phenanthroline complex. Nitrosoarenes, trapped by conjugated dienes, afforded 3,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;[1,2]&#8208;oxazines. The latter were then transformed into N&#8208;arylpyrroles employing CuCl as the catalyst. The reaction allows to prepare pyrroles lacking any substituent in the 2 and 5 positions, which are difficult to produce employing most pyrrole syntheses.







Abstract
Formic acid, activated by acetic anhydride and a base, was employed as a CO surrogate to deoxygenate nitroarenes to nitrosoarenes, a reaction catalyzed by a palladium/phenanthroline complex in the homogeneous phase. Nitrosoarenes were trapped by conjugated dienes to give 3,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;[1,2]&#8208;oxazines. The latter were then transformed into N&#8208;arylpyrroles employing CuCl as the catalyst. The reaction was designed to give the best results for pyrroles lacking any substituent in the 2 and 5 positions, which are difficult to produce employing most pyrrole syntheses.

         <title>Annulation via Ring Opening/Cyclization of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclobutanes with 2&#8208;Naphthols: Access to Highly Functionalized Naphthalene&#8208;Fused Oxepines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a mild and straightforward access to various substituted naphthalene&#8208;fused oxepines from readily available Donor&#8208;Acceptor (D&#8208;A) cyclobutanes and 2&#8208;naphthols is reported. A broad range of functional groups is tolerated during this transformation.







Abstract
A mild and straightforward access to various substituted naphthalene&#8208;fused oxepines from readily available Donor&#8208;Acceptor (D&#8208;A) cyclobutanes is reported. This method involves the Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions of D&#8208;A cyclobutanes with 2&#8208;naphthols to afford ring&#8208;opened products, which can undergo intramolecular cyclization mediated by the NBS&#8208;base system to yield corresponding naphthalene&#8208;fused oxepines. The cyclization protocol involves a nucleophilic attack of the oxygen of 2&#8208;naphthol on the newly formed electrophilic acceptor end of D&#8208;A cyclobutane.

         <title>Azodicarboxylate&#8208;Mediated Peptide Cyclisation: Application to Disulfide Bond Formation in Solution and Solid Phase</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the application of diethylazodicarboxylate as an efficient and highly chemoselective oxidising reagent for the cyclisation of peptides through a disulfide bond is demonstrated. The scope of this application was demonstrated both in solution and on solid phase, and can be extended to the cyclisation of peptides containing oxidation&#8208;sensitive residues, such as methionine and tryptophan.







Abstract
Cyclic peptides are important molecules, playing key roles in protein architecture, as chemical probes, and increasingly as crucial structural elements of clinically&#8208;useful therapeutics. Herein we report methodology using azodicarboxylates as efficient reagents for the facile synthesis of cyclic peptides through a disulfide bridge. The utility of this approach in both solution and solid&#8208;phase, and compatibility with common amino acid side chain functionalities is demonstrated, resulting in cyclic peptides in good yield and purity. This approach has significant potential application for synthesis of molecules of biological or therapeutic significance.

         <title>Solvent Directed Diastereodivergent Synthesis of Spiro&#8208;Oxindoles with Quaternary Carbon Center Forming</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method has been developed to achieve solvent&#8208;directed diastereodivergent cyclization reactions with quaternary center formation. A series of products were obtained with good yields and diastereoselectivities.







Abstract
An efficient method has been developed for the solvent&#8208;directed diastereodivergent cyclization reactions with quaternary center formation. Various spiro&#8208;oxindole diastereoisomers were synthesized with good yields (up to &gt;99&#8201;%) and moderate to high diastereoselectivities (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1). Further study on NMR studies indicates that the key to this approach lies in different interactions between the substrate and organocatalyst across diverse solvents. This methodology may have significant implications for switchable, solvent&#8208;directed diastereodivergent synthesis.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2]&#8208;Dehydrogenative Annulation Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulations go dehydrogenative: a new protocol enables the Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation between resonance&#8208;stabilized acetamides (or 3&#8208;oxoglutarates) and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated cyclic carbonyl derivatives. This dehydrogenative strategy represents a more atom&#8208; and step&#8208; economical version than the corresponding Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed redox&#8208;neutral couplings previously studied by our group, enabling the straightforward construction of a number of heteropolycyclic structures.







Abstract
The significance of cross dehydrogenative couplings has increased considerably in recent years. This article revisits the [3+2] C&#8722;C/N&#8722;C, C&#8722;C/O&#8722;C and C&#8722;C/C&#8722;C annulation strategy, recently reported by our group, according to a Pd(II) catalyzed dehydrogenative variant. Our original report relied on Pd(0) catalysis, using &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated&#8208;&#947;&#8208;oxy carbonyls as bis&#8208;electrophiles and resonance&#8208;stabilized acetamides or 3&#8208;oxoglutarates as C/N and O/C or C/C bis&#8208;nucleophiles, respectively. In this more modern and straightforward Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative approach, &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl derivatives replace &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated&#8208;&#947;&#8208;oxy carbonyls as bis&#8208;electrophiles. Our study includes experimental optimization and showcases the synthetic versatility in the formation of diverse heterocyclic structures, such as bicyclic lactams, furo&#8208;cycloalkanones and bicycloalkane&#8208;diones. Furthermore, a mechanism is proposed to elucidate the underlying processes involved in these reactions.

         <dc:description>A new synthetic approach to novel axially chiral iodobenzocarbazole derivatives based on the highly enantioselective intramolecular iodoarylation of linked alkyne&#8722;indole systems was developed by using the versatile chiral catalyst, Stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;cobalt(III) complex, through an axially chiral iodinated vinylidene o&#8208;quinone methide (IVQM) intermediate. This protocol provides 21 examples in excellent yields with good to high enantioselectivities (up to 96% yield, 98% ee).

         <title>Synthesis of Indenes via Graphene Oxide Mediated Manipulation of Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbocatalysis expands its applicability to the synthesis of indenes via intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts like alkylation of Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hilman alcohols. Graphene oxide (GO) dictated the conditions to document a C&#8722;C bond forming protocol featuring large scope (14 examples) and moderate to high yield (45&#8208;80&#8201;%) under mild reaction conditions. Detailed mechanistic investigation completed the present study.







Abstract
A new metal&#8208;free synthetic approach to functionalized indenes is documented. The use of commercially available graphene oxide (GO) allowed the direct access to indenyl cores (yield up to 80&#8201;%) via intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type allylic alkylations with readily available Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman alcohols. Combined experimental and spectroscopic investigations contributed to shed light on the reaction mechanism dealing with a nanostructured carbon material&#8208;based C&#8722;C bond forming reaction.

         <dc:description>Trans&#8208;cycloalkenes with the X&#8211;C=C&#8211;SeR*&#8208;unit and ring sizes from 9 to 20 have been synthesized. Bond the selenium atom is the chiral (S)&#8208;o&#8208;(1&#8208;Methoxypropyl)phenyl&#8208;residue R*, and X = H, F, Cl, Br, I, Me, Et and CF3. The planar&#8208;chiral trans&#8208;cycloalkenes in combination with the chiral residue R* exist as two diastereomers. These can be distinguished in principle by NMR spectroscopy. We have studied the epimerization of the trans&#8208;cycloalkenes, i.e., the 180&#176; rotation of the X&#8211;C=C&#8208;unit through the cavity of the ring. The measurements were done with variable temperature 13C NMR spectroscopy in the range from &#8211;110 to 140&#176;C. The obtained values of the Gibbs energy of activation &#916;G&#8225;C depend strongly on the ring size. Furthermore, the &#916;G&#8225;C values show dramatic steric effects due to the groups X. The steric requirement of X increases in the series H&#160;&lt;&lt; F &lt;&lt; Cl &lt; Me &lt; Br &lt; I &lt; Et &lt; CF3. Here, F is significantly larger than H, and CF3 is larger than Et. The corresponding iPr&#8208;compounds could not be synthesized. The transition state structures of the ring inversion for ring sizes 8&#8211;20 were calculated at the DFT level of theory.</dc:description>

         <title>Plus&#8208;Size DiPAMP Hybrids for Advanced Rhodium(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation: The 2RBigFUS Model</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multipurpose hydrogenation catalysts, endowed with a top&#8208;performance under economical conditions, is the outcome of Knowles&#8217; DiPAMP evolved version. Bulky rather than super&#8208;thin Ligand models seem to fit better for a broader scope of Rh(I)&#8208;L catalysis. Application to enantiomeric &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;amino acids, &#945;&#8208;arylpropionic acids, &#946;&#8208;phenylbutanoic acid, methylsuccinic acid, and derivatives, is showcased.







Abstract
Outfitting the P,P&#8242;&#8208;distereogenic 2MeBigFUS ligand with the characteristic branched/functionalized&#8208;alkoxy feature of the R&#8208;SMS&#8208;Phos design furnished the 2RBigFUS family (Figure&#8197;2). Rhodium(I) complexes thereof exhibited a further boosted activity and superior enantioselectivity in the hydrogenation of various functionalized olefins, including the challenging &#945;&#8208;arylacrylic acids. The application under practical conditions to enantiomeric active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and relevant synthetic building blocks capped the outcome.

         <title>A Biomimetic Stereoselective Approach to Euolutchuol C and Its Structural Assignment</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first stereoselective total synthesis of euolutchuol C using a biomimetic cationic polyene cyclization is demonstrated, and its absolute structure was established. Four potential stereoisomers of euolutchuol C were synthesized, to confirm the structure as aromatic abietane diterpenoid consisting of 15(S)&#8208;stereogenic center. Asymmetric Sharpless dihydroxylation was used to build chiral epoxide, while CBS&#8208;reduction was&#160;utilized for enantiomerically pure benzylic alcohols. A convergent approach used to synthesize euolutchuol C in seven longest linear steps to give an overall yield of 23%.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A novel dual visible&#8208;light&#8208;photoredox&#8208; and titanocene&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the highly regioselective access to &#945;&#8208;vinyl, &#946;&#8208;hydroxy esters is reported. Thanks to a comprehensive investigation on the reaction conditions, the disclosure of an original protocol based on the Barbier&#8208;type properties of titanocene complexes in low oxidation state is achieved. The reaction showed very good compatibility with several functional groups and a detailed photophysical studies highlighted the role played by each component of the reaction.







Abstract
For the first time, a dual photoredox&#8208; and titanocene&#8208;catalyzed methodology for the regioselective access to &#945;&#8208;vinyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy esters towards aldehyde allylation with 4&#8208;bromobut&#8208;2&#8208;enoate is reported. The protocol is based on the Barbier&#8208;type properties of the inexpensive and available Cp2TiCl2 in catalytic amount (5&#8197;mol%). The developed mild reaction conditions gave access to a library of differently functionalized &#945;&#8208;vinyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy esters in moderate diastereoselectivity, employing the commercially available ethyl 4&#8208;bromobut&#8208;2&#8208;enoate and both aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes. The reaction was realized under visible light irradiation, in the presence of an organophotocatalyst (3DPAFIPN, 2&#8197;mol%) combined with Hantzsch's ester as the sacrificial reductant. In contrast to other Barbier&#8208;type reactions employing ethyl 4&#8208;bromobut&#8208;2&#8208;enoate, the photoredox system ensures a better regioselectivity. Moreover, the use of preformed organometallic nucleophilic species (e.&#8201;g., dienolborinates), and the need of metal reductants or stoichiometric amount of transition metals in low oxidation state for Barbier&#8208;type reactions, is avoided. To support the experimental evidence, a detailed photophysical study shed light on the mechanism of the reaction.

         <title>Chemical Upcycling of Polyolefins through C&#8722;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the latest excellent achievements on chemical upcycling of polyolefins through C&#8722;H functionalization including the installations of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X (X=O, N, S, halogens and etc.) bonds onto polymer backbones to form newly&#8208;functionalized polymeric materials and degradation reactions to provide high&#8208;value added chemicals, which offers new opportunities for better treatments of post&#8208;consumer polyolefin plastics.







Abstract
Polyolefins consist of abundant hydrophobic C&#8722;C and C&#8722;H bonds, and are considered as immensely potential untapped resources. Chemical upcycling offers a convenient and promising recycling strategy of polyolefins to produce newly&#8208;functionalized polymeric materials, and high&#8208;value added chemicals. The significant progress made in C&#8722;H functionalization reactions of alkane molecules provides new opportunities for improving polyolefin treatments. This review focuses on recent advancements in post&#8208;modification routes, specifically the introduction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X (X=O, N, S, halogens and etc.) bonds onto polyolefin chain backbones, as well as degradation models involving homogeneous C&#8722;H functionalization. By emphasizing these developments, we aim to highlight the potential of chemical upcycling for enhancing the treatment of polyolefins.

This review focuses on recent advancements in post-modification routes, specifically the introduction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X (X=O, N, S, halogens and etc.) bonds onto polyolefin chain backbones, as well as degradation models involving homogeneous C&#8722;H functionalization. By emphasizing these developments, we aim to highlight the potential of chemical upcycling for enhancing the treatment of polyolefins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Trifluoromethylselenolation and Fluoroalkylselenolation of C&#8722;H Bonds: Recent Advances in Reagents Development and Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an overview of recent advances in direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethylselenolation and fluoroalkylselenolation from development to the application of corresponding reagents.







Abstract
Due to their high lipophilicity and strong electron&#8208;withdrawing property, more and more attention has been paid to introducing trifluoromethylseleno and fluoroalkylseleno moieties into organic molecules. In this short review, we categorize the synthesis of compounds that combine selenium and fluorinated moieties into two main types: trifluoromethylselenolation (CF3Se) and fluoroalkylselenolation (RfSe, except CF3Se). This review aims to provide a summary of the recent advances in direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethylselenolation and fluoroalkylselenolation from the synthesis of trifluoromethylselenolation and fluoroalkylselenolation reagents to their application. Based on the method of how the RfSe group was introduced, the main content is divided into three parts: transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free reactions, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated/catalyzed reactions and photo&#8208;catalyzed reactions. The general substrate scope, mechanism and limitations would also be discussed so that we hope the review will serve as an inspiration for further research in this appealing research field.

         <title>A Fluorescent Probe for Al3+ Based on Calix[4]arene Containing Salicylaldehyde&#8208;Derived Schiff Base</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fluorescent probe was designed and synthesized by functionalizing the upper edge of calix[4]arenes with salicylaldehyde&#8208;derived Schiff&#8208;bases. This probe could recognize Al3+ with high selectivity and &#8220;on&#8221; fluorescence response.







Abstract
Two novel fluorescent probes L1 and L2 for recognizing Al3+ have been prepared by cooperating salicylaldehyde&#8208;derived Schiff base groups onto the upper rim of the calix[4]arene. Of these probes, L2 is the most effective at recognizing Al3+, displaying a highly selective fluorescence &#8220;on&#8221; response with an emission wavelength at 478&#8197;nm and a Stokes shift of 88&#8197;nm. Additionally, probe L2 can form a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 coordination complex with Al3+ with a binding constant of 2.6&#215;1010&#8197;M&#8722;1. Furthermore, its fluorescence intensity exhibits a good linear relationship with Al3+ concentration within the range of 2.0&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;M to 1.4&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;M, and the probe has a low detection limit of 4.36&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;M.

         <title>Formal Radical Deoxyfluorination of Oxalate&#8208;activated Alcohols triggered by the Selectfluor&#8208;DMAP Charge&#8208;Transfer Complex</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a photon&#8208; and metal&#8208;free approach for the radical fluorination of aliphatic oxalate&#8208;activated alcohols. The method relies on the spontaneous generation of the N&#8208;(chloromethyl)triethylenediamine radical dication, a potent single electron oxidant, from Selectfluor and 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine. The protocol is easily scalable and provides the desired fluorinated products within only a few minutes reaction time.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Molecules: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inherent chirality represents a distinct category of molecular chirality that does not fall within the traditional classification of four chiral elements: central, axial, planar, and helical chirality. While extensive research has been conducted on the catalytic enantioselective construction of these conventional chiralities, the corresponding synthesis of inherently chiral molecules has remained largely unexplored. This minireview provides a comprehensive summary of recent advancements in this field, focusing on the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of inherently chiral calixarenes, saddle&#8208;shaped tetraphenylenes and their heterocycle derivatives, mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes and chiral multilayer 3D frameworks, as well as our perspective in this field.</dc:description>

The direct transformation of N&#8208;protected &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids into corresponding &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams through in&#8197;situ activation of carboxylic acid using the peptide coupling agent HBTU in the presence of base DIPEA is reported. The transformation involves the trans to cis isomerization of carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds.







Abstract
The &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams have been found in many biologically active peptide natural products. Due to their biological activities, extensive efforts have been made in the literature to synthesize the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams. Here, we are reporting the spontaneous transformation of E&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids into &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactam through in&#8208;situ activation of free carboxylic acid using peptide coupling reagent HBTU and base DIPEA at room temperature. The transformation also involves the E&#8594;Z isomerization of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids. The reaction is also compatible with the peptides consisting of E&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amino acids at the C&#8208;terminus. The &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams were isolated in very good yields. Even though the reaction required very mild conditions, the products were isolated in the form of a racemic mixture. However, the products can be separated under a chiral environment. No &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams were observed if the reaction was performed in the presence of free amines. In addition, no racemization was observed during the peptide synthesis. The analysis of the reactions of various substrates revealed that amide NH and &#947;&#8208;CH are important for lactamization. No &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams or E&#8594;Z isomerization products were observed in the case of N&#8208;Me&#8208;(E)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids, whereas in the case of E&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;,&#947;&#8208;dimethyl amino acid &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactam was isolated, however, with low yield.

         <title>Organometallic Reagents: Efficient Tools for the Synthesis of Fused Pyridinyl&#8208;Lactones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>: Herein we disclose an efficient one&#8208;pot route to a wide range of 3&#8208;substituted fused pyridinyl&#8208;lactones so called aza&#8208;phthalides. The developed strategy involves a Metal/Halogen Exchange (MHE) reaction as key step, followed by an electrophile trapping using various carbonyl derivatives and a subsequent lactonization. To promote the MHE reaction with high chemoselectivity, our investigations have particularly focused on the nature of mono&#8208; or bimetallic derivatives as metalation reagents including organolithiums, Grignard reagents and lithium organomagnesiate complexes, and highlighted the positive salt effect on reactional sequence. An extension to fused heteroaryl&#8208;lactones (benzothienyl&#8208;, benzofuranyl&#8208; and naphthofuranyl scaffolds) was explored.</dc:description>

         <title>Amination of Isonitriles in Water: Urea Synthesis under Biocompatible Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocompatible ligation of isonitriles and amines to ureas in neutral aqueous medium was developed here. Direct labeling of Ac4GlcN has been achieved in Hep G2 cells, which may be used to diagnose proteins with abnormal expression in their native habitats. The ligation will provide new avenues for amines and isonitriles in chemical biology applications.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal reactions have been widely used to track biomolecules in living systems. Due to stringent requirements of physiological conditions, enriching the toolkit of bioorthogonal reactions remains the most important and challenging issue. Herein, the biocompatible ligation of isonitriles and amines to ureas in neutral aqueous medium was developed for the first time. The ligation showed benign nature of biocompatibility, broad substrate scope, and specific chemoselectivity. Meanwhile, urea as a natural linkage, its derivatives played an important role in medicinal chemistry. The second&#8208;order reaction rate constant (k2) was determined, which was higher or comparable to that of Staudinger ligation and strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC). Direct labeling of Ac4GlcN has been achieved in Hep G2 cells.

         <dc:description>
Synthesis of anticancer drug bicalutamide promoted by visible light in one step from the corresponding N&#8208;arylacrylamide is described. This approach involves a one&#8208;pot hydroxysulfonylation reaction through a photocatalytic redox process. The use of Na2Eosin Y as photocatalyst and blue light allows the access to a broad range of &#945;&#8208;hydroxysulfonylamides bearing a quaternary center in moderate to good yields with complete regioselectivity through radical process.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free [3+2] Cycloaddition of Isoquinolinium/Pyridinium Ylides and Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and operationally simple one&#8208;pot protocol for the [3+2] cycloaddition of isoquinolinium/pyridinium ylides and electron&#8208;deficient alkenes using NaBH3CN as reductant has been developed. A series of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines and pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;a]indolizines were synthesized in excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;%) with excellent diastereoselectivities (up to &gt;20/1 dr).







Abstract
The development of simple&#8208;to&#8208;operate methods for the preparation of indolizidine derivatives are of great importance. A mild one&#8208;pot protocol for the [3+2] cycloaddition of isoquinolinium/pyridinium ylides and electron&#8208;deficient alkenes using NaBH3CN as reductant has been developed. The protocol has a broad substrate scope (more than 40 examples) and provides various novel hexahydroindolizidine derivatives in high yields and excellent diastereoselectivities (up to &gt;20/1).

     alt="Catalyst-Free [3+2] Cycloaddition of Isoquinolinium/Pyridinium Ylides and Electron-Deficient Alkenes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mild and operationally simple one-pot protocol for the [3+2] cycloaddition of isoquinolinium/pyridinium ylides and electron-deficient alkenes using NaBH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN as reductant has been developed. A series of pyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinolines and pyrrolo[3,4-a]indolizines were synthesized in excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;%) with excellent diastereoselectivities (up to &amp;gt;20/1 dr).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of simple-to-operate methods for the preparation of indolizidine derivatives are of great importance. A mild one-pot protocol for the [3+2] cycloaddition of isoquinolinium/pyridinium ylides and electron-deficient alkenes using NaBH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN as reductant has been developed. The protocol has a broad substrate scope (more than 40 examples) and provides various novel hexahydroindolizidine derivatives in high yields and excellent diastereoselectivities (up to &amp;gt;20/1).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalytic C&#8722;H Functionalization of Nitrogen Heterocycles Mediated by a Redox Active Protecting Group</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a photocatalytic strategy to efficiently access functionalized azaheterocycles starting from one equivalent of an heterocyclic precursor incorporating a redox active benzamide protecting group. Activation of the protecting group triggered an intramolecular 1,5&#8208;HAT leading to &#945;&#8208;aminoradical intermediates that were engaged in Giese additions or radical cross couplings to respectively afford alkylated or arylated products.







Abstract
Herein, we report a photocatalytic strategy for the C&#8722;H functionalization of saturated azaheterocycles under mild conditions with only one equivalent of starting material. Our strategy is based on a redox active benzamide protecting group that is activated via a halogen&#8208;atom transfer (XAT) process to trigger the formation of an &#945;&#8208;amino radical. This nucleophilic radical intermediate was then engaged in Giese additions and radical cross couplings to afford C&#8722;H alkylated and arylated products.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Domino and Multicomponent Reactions: How to Reach Molecular Complexity Without a Catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high molecular complexity can be not trivial, but the exploitation of domino reactions provides an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical method to reach this target. Over the past decades, a lot of efforts have been put on the development of photocatalytic cascades employing both metal&#8208;based and purely organic catalysts. Despite the effectiveness of these protocols, catalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free light&#8208;induced domino reactions are gaining momentum thank to their efficiency, operational simplicity and sustainability. The increasing number of papers published on this field in the last years is a proof of the appeal of these transformations. In this Review, we discuss domino and multicomponent reactions mediated by light with a focus on photocatalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free processes. The most recent advances in the synthesis of complex nitrogen&#8208;, oxygen&#8208;, sulphur/selenium&#8208;heterocycles together with multicomponent cascades are analysed with an emphasis on both experimental and mechanistic studies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Synthetic model triacylglyceride oils are important compounds for applications in pharmaceutical and food chemistry. Herein, a practical and highly efficient methodology for the synthesis of saturated and unsaturated triacylglycerides utilizing saturated and unsaturated fatty acids activated by 1,1&#8217;&#8208;carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) has been developed and applied in the synthesis of deuterated medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil for studies of plant&#8208;based and diary food emulsions. The deuterium labelled compounds were used to gain new insight into the mechanism of the reaction, which was confirmed by density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A palladium catalyzed decarboxylative [4+2] cycloaddition of vinyl benzoxazinanones with 2&#8208;arylidene indan&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione has been established, which afford a series of bioactive spiro&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines (27 examples) in moderate to good yield (up to 87%) with high diastereoselectivities. The synthetic utility of this reaction was demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Compounds synthesized by this method potently inhibited proliferation in a panel of cancer cell lines. Particularly, the most potent compounds 3ae, 3ah, 3aj and 3fa displayed selective inhibition of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 breast carcinoma cells with IC50 values of 1.292, 0.6118, 0.6558, 1.656 and 2.215 &#181;M, respectively.</dc:description>

Abstract
A novel I2&#8208;DMSO&#8208;mediated cascade cyclization approach for synthesizing 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one scaffold from readily accessible &#946;&#8208;ketosulfoxonium ylides and &#946;&#8208;enaminone derivatives has been developed. Under metal&#8208;free and mild conditions, this cascade transformation facilitates the formation of one C&#8722;C bond and one C&#8722;N bond in a single reaction vessel, exhibiting a wide range of functional group compatibility. In addition, this method added an active hydroxyl group to a quaternary carbon center.

         <title>Mechanochemical Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling with Natural Deep Eutectic Solvent as Liquid&#8208;Assisted Grinding Additive: Merging Two Fields for a Greener Strategy</title>

The combination of two green chemical domains: an efficient and sustainable method for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura mechanochemical cross&#8208;coupling reaction with NaDES as LAG additive. The synthesis process is fast and does not require ligand or heating.







Abstract
The use of volatile solvents for organic synthesis is nowadays questioned due to their negative impact on the environnement. To develop sustainable and environmentally friendly methodologies, we propose to combine two green chemistry concepts: the use of bioinspired solvents: natural deep eutectic solvents (NaDES), and mechanochemistry. Using the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling as a model reaction, we described an efficient mechanochemical method with NaDES as a LAG (liquid&#8208;assisted grinding) additive with short reaction times and without any ligand or additional heating. A mechanochemical extraction was also used to reduce the amounts of extraction solvents and the total time of the synthesis process.

         <title>Activation and Deactivation of Benzylic C&#8722;H Bonds Guided by Stereoelectronic Effects in Hydrogen Atom Transfer from Amides and Amines to Alkoxyl Radicals</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic and product studies on hydrogen atom transfer from the benzylic C&#8722;H bonds of amides and amines to tert&#8208;alkoxyl radicals highlight the important role played by steric and stereoelectronic effects in these reactions. Structural factors that enforce orbital overlap lead to rate accelerations that can exceed 2&#8208;orders of magnitude.







Abstract
Kinetic and product studies on the reactions of tert&#8208;alkoxyl radicals with secondary and tertiary alkanamides bearing benzylic &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds, isoindoline, tetrahydroisoquinoline and the corresponding N&#8208;acetyl derivatives were carried out. Product studies on the reactions with the tert&#8208;butoxyl radical (tBuO&#8901;) point toward exclusive HAT from the benzylic &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds. Comparison of the kH values measured for reaction with the cumyloxyl radical (CumO&#8901;) with those obtained previously for the corresponding reactions of N&#8208;alkyl&#8208; and N,N&#8208;dialkylalkanamides, are indicative of a lack of benzylic activation and the operation of steric and stereoelectronic effects. Compared to N&#8208;methyl and N&#8208;ethyl groups, the presence of N&#8208;benzyl groups increases the barrier required to reach the optimal conformation for HAT, where the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond to be cleaved is perpendicular to the plane of the amide, precluding concurrent overlap with the phenyl &#960;&#8208;system. When the benzylic &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds are in a conformation that allows for optimal overlap with both the phenyl &#960;&#8208;system and the amide &#960;&#8208;system or amine nitrogen lone pair, as in the isoindoline and tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives, increases in kH that exceed 2&#8208;orders of magnitude were observed, highlighting the strong contribution provided by stereoelectronic activation to these HAT processes.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component and atom economic synthesis of biologically and pharmaceutically important fully substituted and functionalized pyrazole derivatives has been accomplished under metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free benign conditions. The strategy involves early condensation of readily available cyclic &#946;&#8208;diketones (dimidone, 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarin and 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;naphthoquinone) and arylglyoxals to generate a chalcone type intermediate which upon acid catalyzed condensation with ambident nucleophile arylhydrazones produces various aryl and cyclic &#946;&#8208;diketone substituted pyrazole derivatives. The synthesis embraces high functional group tolerance, broad substrate scope, excellent yield of the products, short reaction time and operationally simple and mild reaction conditions. The synthesis provides an easy opportunity of incorporating biologically important N&#8208;diarylsulfide/selenide functionality, various enolisable cyclic &#946;&#8208;diketones and other bioactive heterocycles concurrently to pyrazole, which may help in designing and development of pyrazole derivatives of pharmacological significance.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Scaffolds for Light Emission</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic fluorophores with highly efficient luminescence in both solution and solid states have attracted significant attention due to their ability to circumvent the limitations of aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and aggregation&#8208;induced emission type molecules. However, their development and wide&#8208;range applications are hampered by extremely complex synthetic methodologies and limited frameworks with dual&#8208;state emission (DSE) structural characteristics. In sharp contrast to the reported luminogens with big and planar &#960; systems or highly conjugated and twisted structures, we discovered novel three&#8208;dimensional scaffolds in one molecule to achieve DSE. These molecules allowing for rapid access showed completely different molecular packing manners from those of planar conjugated molecules and exhibited excellent optoelectronic properties with diminished intermolecular &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking interactions due to steric hindrance. Our findings should open new avenues for designing DSE molecules with new frameworks, which will enable more successful development of dual&#8208;state emitters for their broad applications in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Multicomponent and Metal&#8208;Free Diels&#8211;Alder/Aromatization Approach to the Stereospecific Synthesis of E&#8208;(Hetero)Stilbenes and Diarylacetylenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward, stereospecific and regioselective strategy for the synthesis of substituted E&#8208;stilbenes and diarylacetylenes without the use of metal catalysts was developed. DFT calculations were also performed confirming a concerted [4+2] reaction mechanism of the key ring&#8208;forming step.







Abstract
Herein, we present a novel and metal&#8208;free approach to the stereospecific synthesis of E&#8208;stilbenes. Starting from substituted 6&#8208;arylhexa&#8208;3,5&#8208;dien&#8208;2&#8208;ones, a multicomponent enolacetylation/intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction was performed using ethyl acetate as a green solvent. The obtained cycloadducts were then oxidized without purification to produce the stilbenic products in good yields up to 67&#8201;% and with complete (E)&#8208;stereospecificity and regioselectivity. Moreover, heterostilbenes were synthetized using this approach, displaying the potential applications of this protocol in pharmaceutical and material sciences. The proposed methodology was further extended to the synthesis of diarylacetylenes, furnishing a new metal&#8208;free synthetic access to this important class of compounds. Furthermore, DFT calculations were performed confirming a concerted [4+2] reaction mechanism of the key ring&#8208;forming step. At last, the energetic analysis of the possible transition states helps to shed some light on the experimentally observed total regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity.

Abstract
A strategy for the synthesis of diverse protected &#945;&#8208;monofluoro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;amino acid derivatives has been developed. This reaction assembles a simple enamide, quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one, and diethyl 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;fluoromalonate through a three&#8208;component reaction driven by visible light. The advantages of this protocol include the simplicity of its operation, mild conditions, high functional group tolerance, and applicability to a wide variety of substrates.

         <title>Practical Synthesis of Pharmaceutically Relevant Pyrroles from &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Aldehydes and Phenacyl Azides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structurally diverse pyrroles were synthesized via direct coupling of &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes and phenacyl azides at ambient temperature without using any strong base or transition metal catalyst. The reaction offers great compatibility in product formation with readily available starting materials and non&#8208;requirement of specialized reaction conditions (very high or extremely low cryogenic temperature, anhydrous solvents, inert atmosphere, etc.) thereby minimizing the laborious practice of synthesizing pyrroles. The scope of the synthetic method was successfully demonstrated by synthesizing 28 different phenyl(5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanones in high yields (87&#8208;95%). Derivatization of a few synthesized pyrroles was demonstrated which shows the potential application of the developed protocol in new functional materials. To get a mechanistic insight of the reaction, a typical reaction was performed in a deuterated solvent and the progress of the reaction was monitored by recording its 1H NMR at regular time intervals.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The first total synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;salinosporamide D was achieved using d&#8208;serine as the sole chiral source. This approach stands out for its application of the principles of memory of chirality and dynamic kinetic resolution in the intramolecular aldol reaction of serine&#8208;derived oxazolidines. These strategies enabled the rapid construction of a pyrrolidinone core and installation of contiguous stereocenters. The key intermediate was readily obtained, culminating the asymmetric total synthesis of salinosporamide D. The total synthesis of salinosporamides A and I was also achieved using the same chemistry.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>5&#8208;Halo&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles are important scaffolds in organic chemistry, but current click reaction cannot produce 1,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted 5&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles in a simple way. Herein, we disclosed a Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed interrupted click reaction, using N&#8208;chlorophthalimide as an electrophilic chlorine source, enabling the facile synthesis of 1,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted 5&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles in one step from readily available terminal alkynes and azides. Complete control of regioselectivities with a broad substrate scope was accomplished by this approach. Furthermore, a novel epoxidation was developed using 5&#8208;chloro&#8208;triazole as substrate, which could be further applied in various organic transformations.</dc:description>

Furthermore, a novel epoxidation was developed using 5-chloro-triazole as substrate, which could be further applied in various organic transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Flavones through NaI&#8208;Mediated Electrochemical Cyclization of Chalcones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we demonstrated a novel electrochemical oxidative cyclization for synthesis of flavone from 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxychalcone using an inexpensive using low toxic NaI as mediator/electrolyte without external additives in EtOH/water solvent. The key features of this reaction include its broad substrate scope, scalability, ability to operate with benign solvent at room temperature, and no requirement of strong oxidizing agent and external additive.







Abstract
A mild electrochemical oxidative cyclization for the synthesis of flavones from easy&#8208;access 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxychalcones was developed using an inexpensive NaI as mediator and electrolyte under ambient temperature in a mixture of EtOH and H2O as solvent. This method was successfully applied to synthesize 26 examples of flavones from a variety of functionalized 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxychalcones. A gram&#8208;scale formal synthesis of bioactive scutellarein was successfully demonstrated. Control experiments were conducted to disclose a possible indirect oxidation via in&#8197;situ generation of iodine. The main advantages of this reaction include its broad substrate scope, scalability, ability to operate with benign solvent, and no requirement for strong oxidizing agents and external additives.

         <title>Efficient Solution Phase Synthesis of PPII Helix Mimicking Ena/VASP EVH1 Inhibitors from Proline&#8208;Derived Modules (ProMs)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the search for efficient inhibitors for the enabled/ vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein homology 1 (EVH1) domain to reduce cell motility in metastatic cancer, we previously developed a toolkit of proline derived modules (ProMs), which mimic the PPII helix found in the natural &#8208;FPPPP&#8208; binding motif of EVH1. In this work, we describe the modular assembly of these ProM&#8208;based penta&#173;peptidic EVH1 ligands through liquid phase peptide synthesis. We initially used pentafluorophenyl (Pfp) active esters for amide bond formation and built up the growing peptide chain from the C&#8208; to the N&#8208;terminus. Switching to HATU/DIPEA coupling conditions and changing the directionality of the synthesis from the N&#8208; to the C&#8208;terminus afforded the target ligands with improved overall yields and purity. Employing a Fmoc&#8208;protected (instead of the N&#8208;acetylated) phenylalanine derivative as N&#8208;terminal building block significantly reduced epimerization. In contrast to the originally used solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), the developed solution phase method allowed for a facile alteration of the C&#8208;terminal ProM unit and the production of various pentapeptidic ligands in an efficient fashion even on a multigram scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Dioxygen&#8208;Triggered &#946;&#8208;Hydroxysulfonylation of Terminal Olefins Controlled by DABCO</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein described a dioxygen&#8208;triggered &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfonylation of unactivated olefins. The selectivity of the reaction is controlled by DABCO, which acts as a single electron transfer reagent in the reaction. This strategy has the advantages of being metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free, clean, safe, with readily available unactivated olefin as the substrate, low cost, easy to perform, high atomic efficiency, and not sensitive to air.







Abstract
A dioxygen&#8208;triggered selectively difunctionalization of olefins to achieve &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfones has been developed. Particularly, the mechanism of this reaction can be controlled by DABCO, which act as a single electron transfer reagent, to selectively obtain ketosulfone or hydroxysulfone. The reaction was conducted in a clean, safe, mild, and catalyst&#8208;free conditions. Moreover, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, two bioactive molecules were synthesized easily using this method.

         <dc:description>
In this work, we have described a synthesis of 3&#8208;thiosugars stereoselectively from 2&#8208;ketoglycals via regioselective displacement of C3 ester group with inversion of configuration. This strategy tolerates well with a variety of substituted thiophenols, aliphatic cyclic thiols, and mercaptans.







Abstract
Herein we designed a strategy for the synthesis of regioselective and stereoselective displacement of C&#8208;3 acetate group in the presence of other C&#8208;4 and C&#8208;6 acetate of 2&#8208;ketophenyl&#8208;glycal by different aromatic and cyclic aliphatic thiol nucleophiles taking inspiration from cytosolic esterase mediated thiolation of glucosamine sugars into cellular glycan. Under a mild base condition at room temperature, the protocol generated a library of 3&#8208;arylthiosugars with excellent yields and high axial selectivity. This stereoselective approach tolerated well with different ester&#8208;protected glycals and thiophenols, aliphatic cyclic thiols, and mercaptans. A variety of control experiments were conducted to establish the mechanism and reason behind the stereoselectivity.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Trifluoromethylated Allylic Alkylation of N&#8208;Substituted Glycine Ethyl Esters with &#945;&#8208;(Trifluoromethyl)alkenyl Acetates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient enantioselective palladium&#8208;catalyzed trifluoromethylated allylic alkylation of N&#8208;substituted glycine ethyl esters using &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)alkenyl acetates as trifluoromethyl&#8208;containing allyl precursors is established. A series of optically active glycine ethyl ester derivatives containing a trifluoromethylated allyl substituent are readily synthesized in good yields with superior enantioselectivities.







Abstract
An efficient strategy for asymmetric trifluoromethylated allylic alkylation of easily available N&#8208;substituted glycine ethyl esters with &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)alkenyl acetates has been developed. Catalyzed by a [Pd(C3H5)Cl]2/(R)&#8208;BINAP, various trifluoromethyl&#8208;containing N&#8208;substituted glycine ethyl ester derivatives are afforded with good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. The product can be readily converted into diverse fluoro&#8208;substituted species, which shows the practicability of this method.

         <title>Pyramidalization at the sp2&#8208;Hybridized ipso&#8208;Carbon Atom of Phenyl Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In toluene, ethylbenzene, and t&#8208;butylbenzene the sp2&#8208;hybridized center at the ipso&#8208;carbon atom of the phenyl ring is pyramidalizing on rotation about the bond phenyl&#8208;substituent. A comparison of structures with pyramidalization and its hypothetical counterparts without pyramidalization shows that pyramidalization is associated with a gain of energy on the basis of DFT calculations and a scatter plot analysis of 14,169 structures of ethylbenzene derivatives.







Abstract
In this study we investigate the pyramidalization of the sp2&#8208;hybridized center at the ipso&#8208;carbon atom Ci of phenyl compounds on the theoretical side by DFT calculations of toluene, t&#8208;butylbenzene, and ethylbenzene and on the experimental side by a scatter plot analysis of 14,169 structures of ethylbenzene compounds C&#946;&#8722;C&#945;H2&#8722;C6H5 with three open positions for variation at C&#946;, accumulated in the Cambridge Structural Database. In a 360&#176; rotation about the bond between C&#945; of the substituent and the ipso&#8208;carbon atom Ci of the phenyl ring, the pyramidalization performs three maxima and minima. A comparison of structures with pyramidalization and its hypothetical counterparts without pyramidalization shows that pyramidalization is associated with a gain of energy. The data reveal that it is the carbon atom C&#945; of the phenyl substituent, which on pyramidalization bends away from the phenyl plane. Pyramidalization of sp2&#8208;hybridized centers is an omnipresent member in molecular weak interactions.

         <title>Second&#8208;Generation Total Synthesis of the Pigment Aurantricholone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Our first total synthesis of aurantricholone established its benzotropolone core by the ring&#8208;enlargement of a tetralone. Here we describe another total synthesis of aurantricholone. It reaches the benzotropolone core from a known olefin metathesis product via an equally known dibromide, both of which contain a ketoketal moiety. The next transformation &#8722; step 9 overall &#8722; engaged this motif in a &#946;&#8208;elimination of ROH rather than in another hydrolysis under the forcing acidic conditions indispensable in all prior benzotropolone preparations from such an intermediate. In step 10, the Csp2&#8722;Br bonds of the elimination product underwent two doubly Z&#8208;selective Suzuki couplings with a boronylated O&#8208;methyl 4&#8208;methylidenetetronate. This gave penta(O&#8208;methyl)aurantricholone. Its NMR shifts matched essentially those of a derivative of natural aurantricholone by Steglich et al.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our first total synthesis of aurantricholone established its benzotropolone core by the ring-enlargement of a tetralone. Here we describe another total synthesis of aurantricholone. It reaches the benzotropolone core from a known olefin metathesis product via an equally known dibromide, both of which contain a ketoketal moiety. The next transformation &#8722; step 9 overall &#8722; engaged this motif in a &#946;-elimination of ROH rather than in another hydrolysis under the forcing acidic conditions indispensable in all prior benzotropolone preparations from such an intermediate. In step 10, the Csp2&#8722;Br bonds of the elimination product underwent two doubly Z-selective Suzuki couplings with a boronylated O-methyl 4-methylidenetetronate. This gave penta(O-methyl)aurantricholone. Its NMR shifts matched essentially those of a derivative of natural aurantricholone by Steglich et al. Three O&#8722;Me bonds were cleaved with BBr3/CH2Cl2 (step 11) and two O&#8722;Me bonds with LiBr/DMF (step 12). A 1:1 co-crystal of aurantricholone and DMSO allowed for an X-ray structure analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

An efficient and straightforward methodology for the synthesis of 1,2,2&#8208;triarylethanones and 2,2&#8208;diarylethanones has been developed, via a visible light&#8208;promoted/Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed carbonyl&#8208;alkyne metathesis/transfer hydrogenation one&#8208;pot reaction of benzoquinone, arylalkyne, and Hantzsch ester.







Abstract
An efficient and straightforward methodology for the synthesis of 1,2,2&#8208;triarylethanones and 2,2&#8208;diarylethanones has been developed, via a visible light&#8208;promoted/Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed carbonyl&#8208;alkyne metathesis/transfer hydrogenation one&#8208;pot reaction of benzoquinone, arylalkyne, and Hantzsch ester. A series of synthetically useful triarylethanones and diarylethanones were achieved in excellent yield under mild reaction conditions. This protocol is operationally simple, photocatalyst&#8208;free, and scalable and has a broad substrate scope. Moreover, this reaction involves the formation of three chemical bonds, namely C=O, C&#8722;C, and C&#8722;H bonds. This feature enables de novo synthesis of 1,2,2&#8208;triarylethanones and 2,2&#8208;diarylethanones. Additionally, this protocol provides a convenient and practical synthetic route for tamoxifen.

         <title>Molecular Turnstiles Featuring Bicyclic Rotators: Solution and Solid&#8208;State Investigation of Steric and Electronic Concerns</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bicyclic rotators connected to rigid stators provide opportunities to study rotational movement via 1H&#8197;NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy. Solution studies suggest rotation or wobbling of the central arene with respect to the rigid stator. Similar motion in the solid&#8208;state may be limited by intermolecular attractions between neighboring compounds.







Abstract
A molecular rotor is created when a 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole rotator is incorporated into a rigid arylene ethynylene framework supported by pyridine coordination to a metal (Ag+ or PdCl2) guest. Comparisons to a similarly sized naphthyl rotator via 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy provide insights into the movement of these bicyclic rotators relative to the rigid stator framework. Chemical shift increases of 0.3&#8197;ppm, or more, upon metal complexation are consistent with through&#8208;space interaction of the central arene with a bound PdCl2 guest. Further study via X&#8208;ray crystallography illustrates that rotation of the 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole unit in the solid state is likely hampered by relatively strong chalcogen bonding (N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S distance of 2.93&#8197;&#197;), forming 2S&#8208;2N squares between benzothiadiazoles of neighboring complexes. Strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions (3.29&#8211;3.36&#8197;&#197;) between neighboring complexes likewise restrict solid&#8208;state rotation of the potential benzothiadiazole rotator. Modest changes to UV&#8211;vis spectra upon metal coordination suggest that electronic properties are mostly independent of stator configuration.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefination has been lately often used in the preparation of trisubstituted alkenes which serve as precursors of natural products and their analogs as well of pharmaceutically interesting/biologically important compounds. Significant observations regarding the stereoselectivity of those reactions are described in this reviewing work covering comprehensively the period 2016&#8211;2022.







Abstract
Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefination, a coupling reaction between a carbonyl component and a sulfone partner, has emerged as a powerful synthetic tool in the preparation of several organic compounds. A number of interesting examples involving particularly the preparation of trisubstituted alkenes along with important observations regarding the stereoselectivity of those reactions have been recently reported. This reviewing work covers the literature for the period 2016&#8211;2022 and describes in a comprehensive way the progress and developments of Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefination application in the synthesis of trisubstituted alkenes which serve as precursors of natural products and their analogs as well of pharmaceutically interesting/biologically important compounds. Moreover, key methodology results dealing with the investigation of the optimum conditions and stereoselectivities and new modifications and approaches are discussed.

         <title>Synthesis of Berkeleylactone A by Ring&#8208;Closing Alkyne Metathesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using some straightforward alkyne chemistry and an asymmetric dihydroxylation on a dienoate, the substrate for a ring&#8208;closing alkyne metathesis (RCAM) was assembled in a few steps. After semihydrogenation of the triple bond, the resulting macrolactone was converted to berkeleylactone A through acetal hydrolysis, allylic oxidation, thia&#8208;Michael addition, hydrogenation, and ester hydrolysis. The 8,9&#8208;didehydro analog was also prepared.







Abstract
A new route to the macrolactone antibiotic berkeleylactone A was developed. As a key step, a ring&#8208;closing alkyne metathesis (RCAM) of an ester substrate featuring 1&#8208;propynyl termini was used. The carboxylic part of the substrate was easily assembled using alkyne chemistry, like carboxylation of a diyne followed by isomerization of the ynoate section to a dienoate and dihydroxylation of the 4,5&#8208;double bond. The synthesis of the alcohol part of the ester started with opening of (R)&#8208;propylene oxide with an acetylide and was followed by two triple bond migrations. After successful RCAM which formed the C8&#8722;C9 bond, the triple bond was selectively hydrogenated to the corresponding alkene before the 4,5&#8208;diol was oxidized to the 5&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;oxo derivative. At this stage, the thioether was formed and the 8,9&#8208;double bond reduced. We also prepared the 8,9&#8208;didehydro analog of berkeleylactone A. However, it turned out that its antimicrobial activity was slightly reduced.

At this stage, the thioether was formed and the 8,9-double bond reduced. We also prepared the 8,9-didehydro analog of berkeleylactone A. However, it turned out that its antimicrobial activity was slightly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organophotocatalyzed Synthesis of Vinyl&#8208;SCF3 and Benzoyl&#8208;SCF3 Using a New N&#8208;(SCF3)(CF3)&#8208;Shelf&#8208;Stable Reagent</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unprecedented use of PhPhN(SCF3)(CF3) as an efficient reagent for the formation of C&#8722;SCF3 bond under photoredox conditions is reported. The organophotocatalyst could be used in conjunction with bromine as an activator or in the presence of FAT catalyst for the synthesis of vinyl&#8208;SCF3 and benzoyl&#8208;SCF3. Moreover, preliminary mechanistic investigation including EPR spectroscopy allow us to identify key radicals in the reactions processes.







Abstract
We report the photocatalyzed C&#8722;SCF3 bond formation using a new shelf&#8208;stable PhPh&#8208;N&#8208;(SCF3)(CF3) reagent I in combination with 4CzIPN as organophotocatalyst under blue LED irradiation. While the synthesis of vinyl&#8208;SCF3 is performed in the presence of bromide salts as an activator of reagent I, the synthesis of trifluoromethylthioesters was undertaken using aldehydes as starting material in the presence of a hydrogen atom transfer catalyst (HAT). Preliminary mechanistic investigations including EPR spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry analysis shed the light on the reaction mechanisms.

This air&#8208;stable copper catalyst shows robust catalytic performance and tolerates a diverse array of functional groups on both the N&#8208;nucleophile and arylboronic acid coupling partners in C&#8211;N bond forming reactions through the CEL reaction with up to 95% yield. Formation of the Cu&#8208;NHC complex in situ generated similar catalytic performance for CEL coupling.

         <title>Difluoromethoxylated Ketones as Building Blocks for the Synthesis of Challenging OCF2H&#8208;Bearing N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles bearing the Emerging Fluorinated Group &#8722;OCF2H is herein disclosed. Various difluoromethoxylated pyrazoles, isoxazoles, pyrimidines and indoles were thus quickly and easily obtained. These new structures of high value were accessed from simple &#945;&#8208;(difluoromethoxy)ketones as versatile building blocks in a one&#8208;pot process.







Abstract
We report herein an unprecedented synthesis of difluoromethoxylated nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles from the corresponding &#945;&#8208;(difluoromethoxy)ketones as versatile building blocks. Pyrazoles, isoxazoles and pyrimidines could be obtained via an enaminone intermediate, whereas in the direct reaction of &#945;&#8208;(difluoromethoxy)ketones with arylhydrazines, a Fischer indole synthesis was achieved. All these scaffolds, which are uncommon, or even sometimes novel, due to the directly attached emerging fluorinated group (EFG) &#8722;OCF2H, might be of high potential in life sciences and appear as an interesting alternative to more and more controversial classical fluorinated groups, such as the ubiquitous trifluoromethyl group.

         <title>Synthesis and Chiroptical Properties of Binaphthyl&#8208;Hinged [5]Helicenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel [5]helicene linked by binaphthyl was prepared as a chiroptical dye exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence. The rigid [5]helicene exhibits higher glum values (6.0&#8211;6.8&#215;10&#8722;3) than unlocked helicenes. This is attributed to the C2 structure in the excited state, where the magnetic and electric transition dipole moments are parallel.







Abstract
The synthesis, structure, and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of two types of shape&#8208;persistent [5]helicenes, hinged by a tethered (&#8722;OCH2CH2O&#8722;) or untethered (&#8722;OCH3) binaphthyl, are reported. The binaphthyl tethering system facilitated an effective Wittig ring&#8208;closure reaction in the synthesis of a macrocyclic precursor, which could be easily converted to the title compound via successive photocyclization. The tethered groups were replaced with untethered &#8722;OCH3 groups by treatment with BBr3 followed by methylation. Both compounds exhibited similar spectra, and their longest wavelength absorption band with a low intensity was attributed to the transition from HOMO to LUMO+1. These compounds exhibited CPL with higher dissymmetry factors glum values than unlocked helicenes.

         <dc:description>&#948;&#8208;Butyrolactams with an exocyclic ester moiety in the &#948;&#8208;position were accessed by reduction of 1&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;cyclopentanone carboxylates with PBu3 or Zn&#8208;AcOH. The ring transformation proceeded readily under the conditions of this reduction which is an unprecedented process. Primary amines formed by catalytic hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;azido&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoesters with larger ring sizes or with benzannulation do not show this rearrangement under the conditions of the azide reduction. In these cases, the ring transformation to respective lactams was achieved by treatment of the &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoesters with a stoichiometric amount of lithium diisopropylamide.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical Dearomatising Spirocyclisation of Benzisoxazole&#8208;Tethered Ynones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dearomative spirocyclisation of benzisoxazoles through a radical chain mechanism is described. Densely functionalised spirocycles were prepared in high yields by reacting benzisoxazole&#8208;tethered ynones with aryl thiols in 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane (DCE) at 60 &#176;C. The identification of stabilising three&#8208;electron interactions was key to the development of this new radical cascade reaction. The obtained spirocyclic products were converted into other spirocyclic scaffolds through a two&#8208;step hydrogenolysis&#8208;cyclisation sequence.</dc:description>

The identification of stabilising three-electron interactions was key to the development of this new radical cascade reaction. The obtained spirocyclic products were converted into other spirocyclic scaffolds through a two-step hydrogenolysis-cyclisation sequence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Hydrosilylation of Imines by Aluminum Hydride Cations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide range of imines were hydrosilylated with a variety of silanes under the catalytic potential of electronically unsaturated cationic aluminum hydrides. Imines were activated by the cationic Al hydrides via the Lewis adduct formation and subsequently reduced by the silanes.







Abstract
In this work, the catalytic activity of electronically unsaturated three coordinated aluminum hydride cations [LAlH]+[HB(C6F5)3]&#8722; (1) and [LAlH]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; (2) in hydrosilylation of imines has been disclosed (L={(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3N)P(Ph2)}2N). A variety of organo&#8208;silanes such as Et3SiH, MePhSiH2, PhSiH3, TMDSO, and PHMS are screened in this endeavour. The amines as products of catalysis were obtained in good to excellent yields after the hydrolysis of silylamine intermediates. Further, a series of controlled experiments systematically designed to investigate the underlying mechanistic pathway through multinuclear NMR analysis showed Lewis adduct formation between cationic aluminum centre and the imine nitrogen, which subsequently undergoes reaction with silane to afford the product. The hydrosilylation of imine performed with Et3SiH using catalyst 1 with a loading of 2&#8197;mol&#8201;% at 60&#8201;&#176;C occurs smoothly. Whereas 2 led to the product formation with Et3SiH only when used in stoichiometric quantity. Further, to investigate this unique behaviour of 1 NMR investigations were performed and revealed that the anion in 1 competes for hydride delivery and in&#8208;situ generates B(C6F5)3 that cooperatively reinforces the catalytic activity of 1.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid phase oligonucleotide synthesis calls for improved methodologies. We have tested an acetal modification for protection of the 5&#8217;&#8208;O site of nucleotide building blocks. Good yields were obtained in synthesis of short 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyoligonucleotides by phosphoramidite chemistry on a soluble support. The advantages of the title group include fast cleavage, easily removable volatile residues, and small size improving the atom economy.







Abstract
5'&#8208;O&#8208;(2&#8208;isopropoxyprop&#8208;2&#8208;yl) (IIP)&#8208;protection was introduced to 5&#8217;&#8208;OH function of nucleosides in high yields by an acid&#8208;catalysed transacetalization with 2,2&#8208;diisopropoxypropane. The applicability of this temporal 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;protecting group was demonstrated in the liquid phase oligonucleotide synthesis (LPOS) using the corresponding phosphoramidite building blocks (dA, dG, dC and dT) and a tetrapodal precipitative soluble support. Standard protecting groups were used on nucleobases. Tetrazole as an activator, followed by oxidation using m&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid, was used for the coupling. The IIP was shown to be a capable choice to the 5&#8217;&#8208;O protection in solution phase synthesis. It could be readily removed with formic acid (t1/2&lt;10&#8197;s in 6&#8201;% HCOOH in dichloromethane/methanol (2/1) at RT), resulting in volatile byproducts (acetone and isopropanol).

         <title>Insights into the Self&#8208;Filling Effects of Branched Isopropyl Groups on the Conformational and Supramolecular Properties of Isopropoxyprism[6]arene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The closed state cuboid D2&#8208;conformation of the isopropoxy&#8208;prism[6]arene shows four isopropyl groups folded inside the cavity, to give C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions and filling the internal void. The cuboid D2&#8208;conformation of PrS[6]iPr is stabilized to a greater extent than ethyl or propyl groups in PrS[6]Et and PrS[6]nPr. The higher resistance of PrS[6]iPr to open its cuboid D2 conformation, with respect to PrS[6]Et and PrS[6]nPr, also affected its supramolecular and conformational features.







Abstract
In this work, the direct macrocyclization of a prism[6]arene macrocycle bearing branched alkyl chains on the rims is reported. Isopropoxyprism[6]arene adopts in solution and in the solid state a cuboid D2&#8208;conformation in which four isopropyl groups are folded inside the cavity, to give C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions and filling the internal void. The conformational features of isopropoxyprism[6]arene have been studied by dynamic 1H NMR experiments. The presence of branched isopropyl chains on the prism[6]arene rims, stabilizes the cuboid D2&#8208;conformation to a greater extent than ethyl or propyl groups in PrS[6]Et and PrS[6]nPr. The higher resistance of PrS[6]iPr to open its cuboid D2 conformation, with respect to PrS[6]Et and PrS[6]nPr, also affected its binding abilities. In fact, alkylammonium&#8208;based endo&#8208;cavity complexes of PrS[6]iPr show lower binding constant values than the analogous propoxy/ethoxy&#8208;prism[6]arene complexes.

         <title>DFT Calculations and Synthesis Reveal: Key Intermediates, Omitted Mechanisms, and Unsymmetrical Bimane Products</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Theoretical and experimental mixed approaches are complementary and valuable. Our DFT calculations support the mechanism suggested by Kosower, adding to it a key diaziridine intermediate that determines the relative product distribution of this reaction. Our results are consistent with the formation of the diazoketene intermediate as the rate&#8208;limiting step. Based on curve fittings, first or second&#8208;order kinetics cannot be ruled out. This may indicate that more than one mechanism is simultaneously at play in this transformation. This unexpected outcome led us to study an alternative cyclopropenone intermediate. Although cyclopropenone is not likely to be formed under thermal conditions, adding it to the reaction mixture results in bimane structures. The most staggering finding from this investigation was the unanticipated generation of the unsymmetrical anti&#8208;(Me,Me)(Ph,Ph)bimane. The optimization of this route towards unsymmetrical bimanes will require additional investigation.</dc:description>

         <title>Multienzymatic Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Lactam Building Blocks from Unsaturated Esters and Hydroxylamine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The assembly of enzymatic cascades and multi&#8208;step reaction sequences represents an attractive alternative to traditional synthetic&#8208;organic approaches. The biocatalytic reaction mediators offer not only mild conditions and permit the use of environmentally benign reagents, but the high compatibility of different enzymes promises more streamlined reaction setups. In this study, a triple&#8208;enzymatic strategy was developed that enables the direct conversion of &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated esters to N&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactame building blocks. Hereby, a lipase&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylaminolysis generates hydroxamic acid intermediates that are subsequently aerobically activated by horseradish peroxidase and glucose oxidase to cyclize in an intramolecular nitroso ene reaction. Utilizing the hydroxyl&#173;aminolysis/ene&#8208;cyclization sequence for the preparation of an aza&#8208;spirocyclic lactam, the multi&#8208;enzymatic methodology was successfully employed in the synthesis of key intermediates en route to alkaloids of the Cephalotaxus family.</dc:description>

         <title>Protocell Communication Through the Eyes of Synthetic Organic Chemists</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bottom&#8208;up fabrication of synthetic cells (protocells) from molecules and materials, is a major challenge of modern chemistry. A significant breakthrough has been the engineering of protocells capable of chemical communication using&#160;bio&#8208;derived&#160;natural&#160;molecules and&#160;ex situ&#160;stabilised cell machineries. These, however, suffer from short shelf&#8208;lives, high costs, and require mild aqueous conditions. In this Concept Article we analyse the chemistry at the heart of protocell communication to highlight new opportunities for synthetic chemists in protocell engineering. Specifically, we (i) categorise the main bio&#8208;derived chemical communication machineries in enzyme cascades, DNA strand displacement, and gene&#8208;mediated communication; (ii) review the chemistries of these signal transduction machineries; and (iii) introduce new types of bio&#8208;inspired, fully synthetic artificial enzymes to replace their natural counterparts. Developing protocells that incorporate synthetic analogues of bio&#8208;derived signal transduction machineries will improve the robustness, stability and versatility of protocells, and broaden their applications to highly strategic fields such as photocatalysis and fine chemicals production.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Reductive Amination in Organocatalysis and Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the recent progress in the area of organocatalytic and biocatalytic asymmetric reductive amination (ARA) has been summarized, a challenging but important topic for drug discovery and the pharmaceutical industry. The current challenges and opportunities in organocatalytic and biocatalytic ARA are also discussed.







Abstract
This review summarizes the recent progress of organocatalytic and biocatalytic asymmetric reductive amination (ARA), a challenging but important topic for drug discovery and the pharmaceutical industry. At present, ARA can be divided into three categories: metal catalysis, organic catalysis, and biocatalysis. In the past decade, transition metal&#8208;catalysed ARA has been well established. Organocatalytic ARA has emerged as a powerful alternative to metal&#8208;catalysed ARA, the hydrogen sources used in organocatalytic ARA are usually Hantzsch esters, benzothiazolines, boranes, and hydrosilanes, which require Lewis base or phosphoric acid catalysts to activate them to give secondary chiral amines. It is worth mentioning that biocatalytic ARA has made remarkable progress in the last decade, amino acid dehydrogenases, amine dehydrogenases, opine dehydrogenases and imine reductases have been successfully used in ARA.

         <title>Biotransformations with Imine Reductases: Design of a Practical Process Avoiding an Extractive Work&#8208;Up by Entrapment of Water and Enzymes in an Immobilized Phase</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A process concept for the asymmetric biocatalytic reduction of heterocyclic imines addressing the efficiency of the reaction as well as downstream&#8208;processing steps was studied by utilizing a &#8220;heterogenized aqueous phase&#8221;, which contains the needed enzymes and cofactor within a superabsorber (polyacrylate) network, for the biotransformation. The immobilized biocatalytic system, which comprises an imine reductase IRED, NADPH and an alcohol dehydrogenase for cofactor&#8208;recycling, enables to run the reaction in pure organic medium. Thus, instead of an extractive work&#8208;up as typical solution for biotransformations in aqueous medium, which, however, can be tedious due formation of emulsions, this type of IRED&#8208;catalyzed process leads to a simplified work&#8208;up consisting only of a decantation of the liquid organic reaction medium with the product from the heterogenized aqueous biocatalyst system. Exemplified for the (R)&#8208;enantioselective reduction of 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroisoquinoline by the IRED of Streptomyces viridochromogenes as a model reaction, a process was developed leading to 98% conversion, 88% yield and &gt;99% ee at a substrate concentration of 40 mM.</dc:description>

         <title>The Evolution of Phosphite&#8208;Oxazoline Ligands for the Pd&#8208;Allylic Substitution and Their Application in Building Chiral Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept provides an overview of the evolution in the ligand design of biaryl phosphite&#8208;oxazoline ligand libraries for the asymmetric Pd&#8208;catalyzed allylic substitution. In addition, the effectiveness of this approach in the construction of chiral bi&#8208; and tricyclic complex molecules is also summarized.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution (AAS) is a highly effective method for producing chiral molecules with alkene&#8208;substituted frameworks which can be further derivatized. However, its stereochemical outcome is affected by the steric requirements of the substrate and only a narrow set of nucleophiles yield excellent enantioselectivities. In this regard, phosphite&#8208;oxazolines have emerged as strong candidates to be privileged ligands for this process, providing results that surpass most of the previously published studies. They have provided high enantiocontrol when used in the Pd&#8208;AAS of several hindered and unhindered substrates, using a wide range of C&#8208;, O&#8208;, and N&#8208;nucleophiles. In this concept, we review and discuss the current progress made in the design of tailor&#8208;made phosphite&#8208;oxazoline ligand libraries for the Pd&#8208;AAS of a broad range of substrates and nucleophiles and its application in the construction of chiral complex molecules.

         <title>Carbofluorination of &#960;&#8208;Bonds and Related Reactions Involving Tandem C&#8722;C/C&#8722;F Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review on the carbofluorination of &#960;&#8208;bonds and related transformations involving tandem C&#8722;C/C&#8722;F bond forming reactions is presented. The application of electrophilic fluorine and nucleophilic fluoride reagents in this chemistry is described, as well as recently developed protocols involving the use of fluorinated organic molecules in atom&#8208;economic carbofluorination reactions.







Abstract
Due to the unique properties of C&#8722;F bonds, organofluorine compounds occupy a privileged space in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and polymer industries. Carbofluorination reactions involve the formation of a C&#8722;C and a C&#8722;F bond, typically across a &#960;&#8208;bond or another unsaturated functionality that is revealed upon in situ activation. The design of tailored substrates and new catalyst systems has enabled carbofluorination chemistry to emerge as a promising manifold for the synthesis of unique fluorinated scaffolds.

     alt="Carbofluorination of &#960;-Bonds and Related Reactions Involving Tandem C&#8722;C/C&#8722;F Bond Formation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A review on the carbofluorination of &#960;-bonds and related transformations involving tandem C&#8722;C/C&#8722;F bond forming reactions is presented. The application of electrophilic fluorine and nucleophilic fluoride reagents in this chemistry is described, as well as recently developed protocols involving the use of fluorinated organic molecules in atom-economic carbofluorination reactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the unique properties of C&#8722;F bonds, organofluorine compounds occupy a privileged space in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and polymer industries. Carbofluorination reactions involve the formation of a C&#8722;C and a C&#8722;F bond, typically across a &#960;-bond or another unsaturated functionality that is revealed upon in situ activation. The design of tailored substrates and new catalyst systems has enabled carbofluorination chemistry to emerge as a promising manifold for the synthesis of unique fluorinated scaffolds. This review covers the application of nucleophilic and electrophilic fluorinating reagents in this chemistry, in addition to recently developed atom-economical carbofluorination reactions using organofluorine compounds as dual reagents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
