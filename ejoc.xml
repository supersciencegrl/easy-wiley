      <title>Calcium carbide: versatile synthetic applications, green methodology and sustainability</title>
      <dc:description>Acetylene is a key building block for organic chemistry and potentially can be involved in a diverse range of synthetic transformations. However, critical analysis of practical considerations showed that application of gaseous acetylene in regular synthetic labs encounters a number of difficulties. Safety limitations due to flammable and explosive nature of gaseous acetylene and requirements for specialized high&#8208;pressure equipment impose serious drawbacks. Typical reaction conditions involve excess of gaseous reactant, which is simply released to the atmosphere at the end of the reaction, thus generating waste and causing contamination. Calcium carbide brings a new green and sustainable wave into powerful alkyne transformations and significantly expands the repertoire of traditional acetylene chemistry. The novel trend of using calcium carbide instead of gaseous acetylene is synthetically beneficial and opens a novel reactivity for the C&#8801;C unit. This review highlights recent advances in carbide chemistry, demonstrates its advantages and prospects in term of green synthetic approach.</dc:description>

      <title>Isomerisation of vinyl sulfones for the stereoselective synthesis of vinyl azides</title>
      <dc:description>Reported is the construction, and facile base&#8208;mediated conversation of ten differently substituted 3&#8208;azido E&#8208; vinyl sulfones (&#947;&#8208;azido&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated sulfones) into their isomeric vinyl azide counterparts. The requisite 3&#8208;azido E&#8208; vinyl sulfones were prepared from 3&#8208;bromo E&#8208; vinyl sulfones, which in turn were accessed from allyl sulfones via a bromination&#8208;elimination sequence. In relation to this a one&#8208;pot azidation&#8208;isomerisation sequence was developed which enabled the direct formation of the vinyl azides from the corresponding 3&#8208;bromo E&#8208; vinyl sulfones. Similarly, a convenient one&#8208;pot Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons olefination&#8208;isomerisation approach was utilised in order to prepare some of the allylic sulfones used in this study. The vinyl azide forming process typically proceeded with high levels of Z &#8208;selectivity, although this was dependent on the vinyl sulfone substitution pattern. Thus, with either no substituent or a methyl group in the &#947;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;position, relative to the sulfone, good, to high levels of Z &#8208;selectivity ( Z:E = 85:15 to &#8805;95:5) were obtained. However, incorporation of an &#945;&#8208;sulfonyl methyl substituent led to an E &#8208;selective process ( Z:E = 20:80). A non&#8208;bonding interaction between the azido group and the &#945;&#8208;sulfonyl vinylic proton is proposed, which acts as a conformational control mechanism to help guide the stereochemical outcome.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reported is the construction, and facile base&#8208;mediated conversation of ten differently substituted 3&#8208;azido E&#8208; vinyl sulfones (&#947;&#8208;azido&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated sulfones) into their isomeric vinyl azide counterparts. The requisite 3&#8208;azido E&#8208; vinyl sulfones were prepared from 3&#8208;bromo E&#8208; vinyl sulfones, which in turn were accessed from allyl sulfones via a bromination&#8208;elimination sequence. In relation to this a one&#8208;pot azidation&#8208;isomerisation sequence was developed which enabled the direct formation of the vinyl azides from the corresponding 3&#8208;bromo E&#8208; vinyl sulfones. Similarly, a convenient one&#8208;pot Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons olefination&#8208;isomerisation approach was utilised in order to prepare some of the allylic sulfones used in this study. The vinyl azide forming process typically proceeded with high levels of Z &#8208;selectivity, although this was dependent on the vinyl sulfone substitution pattern. Thus, with either no substituent or a methyl group in the &#947;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;position, relative to the sulfone, good, to high levels of Z &#8208;selectivity ( Z:E = 85:15 to &#8805;95:5) were obtained. However, incorporation of an &#945;&#8208;sulfonyl methyl substituent led to an E &#8208;selective process ( Z:E = 20:80).

The Cover Feature shows that movement along a trajectory is regulated in dynamic rotaxane systems even by subtle steric changes imposed by varying incorporated amino acids in the molecular thread component. As elucidated by dynamic and VT NMR studies of a series of two station hydrogen&#8208;bonding molecular shuttles in aqueous and organic solvent, ring movement can be readily tuned by up to four orders of magnitude.

      <title>Recent Advancements in Allylic C(sp3)&#8211;H Functionalization of Olefins Catalyzed by Rh(III) or Ir(III) Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
  The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed allylic C&#8211;H functionalization of olefins with nucleophiles is a powerful method to synthesize highly valuable allylic functionalized molecules in a highly regioselective manner. This present review describes the recent advancements in allylic C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization of olefins with nucleophiles catalyzed by Rh(III) or Ir(III) complexes.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Olefins are widely available feedstocks and can be readily functionalized into complex organic molecules. In particular, the regioselective allylic C&#8211;H functionalization of olefins can provide highly valuable allylic functionalized organic molecules in a highly atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical manner. This present review describes the recent advancement on allylic C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization of olefins catalyzed by Rh(III) or Ir(III) complexes. This review covers the advancement in the allylic C&#8211;H amination, arylation and etherification of olefins catalyzed by Rh(III) or Ir(III) complexes.

      <title>Synthesis and Properties of Dibenzo[a,j]acridines</title>
      <dc:description>
  Dibenzo[a,j]acridines have been synthesized in three steps and high overall yields using a Br&#248;nsted acid mediated cycloisomerization as the final key step. Optical&#8208; and electrochemical properties have been studied by UV/Vis&#8208; and fluorescence spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  A convenient three&#8208;step synthesis of dibenzo[a,j]acridines is reported which relies on regioselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions of 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrachloropyridine and subsequent Br&#248;nsted acid mediated cycloisomerization. Products are obtained in good yields and the method is broadly applicable. For selected dibenzo[a,j]acridines, photophysical and electrochemical properties were studied.

      <title>Unveiling the Reactivity of Cyclic Azomethine Ylides in [3+2] Cycloaddition Reactions within the Molecular Electron Density Theory</title>
      <dc:description>The [3+2] cycloaddition (32CA) reactions of cyclic azomethine ylides with a series of acetylene derivatives have been studied within the Molecular Electron Density Theory (MEDT). Analysis of the Conceptual DFT indices allows characterising the ambiphilic character of these cyclic AYs, thus participating as strong electrophiles and strong nucleophiles in polar 32CA reactions. Analysis of the activation enthalpies associated with the 32CA reactions of these cyclic AYs are found in reasonable agreement with the experimental outcomes. These reactions take place  via  a one&#8208;step mechanism. The 32CA reactions with 1&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1&#8208;propyne and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate take place through highly asynchronous polar transition states (TSs). On the other hand, the strain present in cyclooctyne allows explaining its participation in a non&#8208;polar 32CA reaction  via  a synchronous TS. The present MEDT study allows establishing that the substitution in these cyclic AYs changes their parent  pseudodiradical&#8208;type  reactivity to the zwitterionic&#8208;type one.</dc:description>

      <title>Conformational Mobility and Efficiency in Supramolecular Catalysis. A Computational Approach to Evaluate the Performances of Enzyme Mimics.</title>
      <dc:description>In the present study, we apply a computational approach, based on DFT calculations and molecular dynamics simulations, to investigate the catalytic behavior of four supramolecular catalysts active in the cleavage of phosphodiesters. The QM data indicate the operation of a synchronous associative mechanism with limited differences in the structures and energies of the transition states. The comparison with the experimental data, expressed in terms of effective molarity (EM), suggests that the difference in catalytic performance are not ascribable to a difference in the enthalpy of activation. On the other hand, the analysis of the Molecular Dynamics trajectories clearly indicates the conformational mobility, and therefore the conformational entropy, to be at the origin of the superior catalytic efficiency of the catalysts based on a more preorganized structure. Essentially, the combined method presented here provides, at a limited computational cost, a tool that is simple, general, and potentially suited for a large variety of catalytic systems to rationalize their performances and to predict those of enzyme mimics to be synthesized in a rational design process.</dc:description>

  Highly strained unsaturated carbocyclic rings are high&#8208;energy compounds which are attracting increasing interest &#8211; not just for their peculiar structural and reactivity features &#8211; but also as modern chemical tools for bioorthogonal and in vivo chemistry, especially via inverse&#8208;electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (iEDDA) and strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) reactions. This mini&#8208;review covers two main classes of compounds: 3 to 10 membered&#8208;ring cycloalkynes and trans&#8208;cycloalkenes, including some examples of cyclic enynes, dienes and bridgehead alkenes. Their molecular properties, synthesis and reactivity are presented and discussed, with an emphasis on their functionalization and reactivity.

      <dc:description>
  Cleavage of an aryl&#8208;leaving group bond (Ar&#8211;LG) is the key step in arylation processes for the synthesis of highly functionalized hetero)arenes.

  Cleavage of an Aryl&#8211;Leaving Group bond (Ar&#8211;LG) is the key step in most arylation processes for the synthesis of highly functionalized (hetero)arenes. In metal&#8208;free arylations, depending on the nature of the starting substrates, different thermal and photochemical approaches can be adopted: Single Electron Transfer (SET) and homolysis/heterolysis of an Ar&#8211;LG bond to afford an aryl radical (Ar&#183;) or an aryl cation (Ar+), respectively. Accordingly, the nature of LG plays a key&#8208;role in determining the mechanism and efficiency of the process.

      <title>Continuous Flow Organophosphorus Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
  With applications ranging from common laboratory reagents to agrochemical blockbusters, organophosphorus compounds are central to organic chemistry. Flow chemistry and related technologies have opened new perspectives in the many areas of organic chemistry, from methodology to total synthesis in R&amp;D and production, regardless of the final potential industrial application.

  Organophosphorus derivatives are widespread compounds that chemists find from the bench to the plant, with numerous daily life applications. Besides their common utility for a wide range of notorious reactions such as the Wittig and Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons olefinations, the Arbuzov reaction, the Staudinger reaction, the Mitsunobu reaction as well as ligands for a large variety of organometallic complexes, organophosphorus compounds have also found numerous applications as active pharmaceutical ingredients and agrochemicals. Some organophosphorus derivatives are also infamously known as Chemical Warfare Agents. Within the context of generalized adoption of new process technologies in the Chemistry Toolbox, this review intends to give an update on the most recent and significant advances in continuous flow organophosphorus chemistry. Selected examples in methodology, total synthesis and for the preparation of industrially relevant targets are discussed for illustrating the assets of flow chemistry.

      <title>Cover Feature: Can Heteroarenes/Arenes Be Hydrogenated Over Catalytic Pd/C Under Ambient Conditions? (Eur. J. Org. Chem. /2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows the exceptionally mild hydrogenation of aromatic compounds, including both heteroarenes and arenes, which was accomplished by using catalytic Pd/C with H2&#8208;balloon pressure at room temperature. As the representative reaction, pyridine was hydrogenated on 1 mol% Pd/C in AcOH to afford piperidine quantitatively. Substrate scope analysis and DFT calculations indicated that reaction rates are highly dependent on the steric bulkiness of substituents and the HOMO/LUMO states. Moreover, the usefulness and chemo&#8208;selectivity of the established reaction were demonstrated by the synthesis of the anti&#8208;Alzheimer drug donepezil. More information can be found in the Full Paper by N. Tanaka and T. Usuki.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Cover Feature&lt;/b&gt; shows the exceptionally mild hydrogenation of aromatic compounds, including both heteroarenes and arenes, which was accomplished by using catalytic Pd/C with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;balloon pressure at room temperature. As the representative reaction, pyridine was hydrogenated on 1 mol% Pd/C in AcOH to afford piperidine quantitatively. Substrate scope analysis and DFT calculations indicated that reaction rates are highly dependent on the steric bulkiness of substituents and the HOMO/LUMO states. Moreover, the usefulness and chemo&#8208;selectivity of the established reaction were demonstrated by the synthesis of the anti&#8208;Alzheimer drug donepezil.

      <dc:description>trans&#8208;Cyclooctenes serve as asymmetric ligands for the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;additions of organotin reagents to enones. We demonstrate for the first time that these chiral olefins can provide efficient coordination spheres for asymmetric metal catalysis.

      <dc:description>An efficient strategy for the synthesis of unexplored 8&#8208;quinolinesulfinate esters has been reported.

A variety of substituted alcohols were successfully employed in the reaction. Control experiments performed to understand the mechanism, revealed that the transformation follows a radical pathway and the alcohol oxygen get incorporated in the resulting sulfinate esters.

In addition, the reaction can also be performed using flow&#8208;chemistry. Finally, a mechanistic proposal based on some mechanistic studies has been described.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Synthesis of 3,5&#8208;Disubstituted 1,2&#8208;Dioxolanes</title>
      <dc:description>Endoperoxides are a source of bioactive compounds which drove to some important anti&#8208;malarial drugs such as artemisinin or arterolane. 1,2&#8208;Dioxolanes drew the attention of many scientists, through the isolation of numerous natural products containing this peroxidized ring structure such as the plakinic acid family or the biosynthetic study of prostaglandins. Thus, a considerable work was reported for the synthesis of such endoperoxides, but mainly applied to the synthesis of 3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208; tetrasubstituted 1,2&#8208;dioxolanes. The recent isolation of new natural products containing a 3,5&#8208;disubstituted dioxolane ring brought our attention on how to specifically prepare such structures. Herein, we tentatively summarize exhaustively all the methods reported for the synthesis of 3,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2&#8208;dioxolanes. Therefore, nucleophilic substitution with hydrogen peroxide or hydroperoxide, use of electrophilic oxygen singlet, use of oxygen triplet in radical reaction and the chemistry of peroxycarbenium ions will be presented for this purpose.</dc:description>

      <title>Reductive carbon&#8722;carbon bond forming reactions with carbonyls mediated by Rh&#8722;H complex</title>
      <dc:description>Carbon&#8722;carbon bond formation is a fundamental transformation of synthetic organic chemistry. This minireview focuses on our works related to reductive aldol reaction, reductive Mannich reaction, reductive &#945;&#8208;acylation, and reductive &#945;&#8208;carboxylation by using rhodium catalyst to achieve C&#8722;C bond formation. Rh&#8208;catalyzed reductive aldol reaction successfully gave &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carbonyl compounds from &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds with aldehydes or ketones by treating with RhCl(PPh  3  )  3  and Et  2  Zn. This condition could apply to other electrophiles such as imines, acid chlorides, and acid anhydrides, and the corresponding &#946;&#8208;lactams, or &#946;&#8208;ketocarbonyl compounds were obtained in good yields, respectively. A key intermediate, Rh&#8722;H complex would play an important role to accomplish 1,4&#8208;reduction, which could easily be derived from RhCl(PPh  3  )  3  and Et  2  Zn. The synthesis of a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ezetimibe, was also achieved by using Rh&#8208;catalyzed reductive Mannich reaction as an application. We expect that the reaction could be used in a wide range of fields by further development.</dc:description>

Synthetically, the scaffolds were constructed by Sonogashira coupling reactions between an iodo&#8208;functionalized IF&#8208;TTF and an acceptor moeity containing a terminal alkyne. These very first IF&#8208;TTF based candidates for DSCs exhibited high performances, in particular a dye incorporating a benzothiadiazole acceptor moiety, showing a conversion efficiency of 6.4%. This result signals that IF&#8208;TTF derivatives present a promising class of compounds for further structural modifications. Such modifications will benefit from the readiness of the iodo&#8208;funcitonalized IF&#8208;TTF building block to undergo Pd&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Arylations of Heteroarenes with Polyfluoroalkoxy&#8208;Substituted Bromobenzenes</title>
      <dc:description>
  Di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;fluoroalkoxy&#8208;substituted bromobenzenes were successfully employed in the direct arylation of 5&#8208;membered ring heteroarenes using Pd&#8208;catalysis. The use of these polyfluoroalkoxy&#8208;substituted bromobenzenes in direct arylation is simpler than the use of bromophenols, as they display a higher reactivity, and as there is no need to introduce a polyfluoroalkyl group to obtain the (polyfluoroalkoxy)benzenes.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The reactivity of di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;fluoroalkoxy&#8208;substituted bromobenzenes in the direct arylation of 5&#8208;membered ring heteroarenes using palladium catalysis was explored. High yields in arylated heteroarenes were obtained using only 1 mol&#8208;% of Pd(OAc)2 catalyst with KOAc as an inexpensive base. Similar yields were obtained with o/m/p trifluoromethoxy&#8208;, o/p difluoromethoxy&#8208;, and tetrafluoroethoxy&#8208;substituents on the aryl bromide. A bromo&#8208;substituted difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxole was successfully coupled. The major side&#8208;products of the reaction are HBr/KOAc. Therefore, this synthetic scheme is very attractive for the access to such polyfluoroalkoxy&#8208;containing arylated heteroaromatics in terms of cost, simplicity, and low environmental impact, compared to reactions involving arylation of heteroarenes with bromophenols followed by polyfluoroalkylation.

      <title>Investigation of Straightforward, Photoinduced Alkylations of Electron&#8208;Rich Heterocompounds with Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkyl Bromides in the Sole Presence of 2,6&#8208;Lutidine</title>
      <dc:description>
  No need for a complex photosensitizer: We introduce a method for selective photoinduced alkylations of electron&#8208;rich heterocompounds with electron&#8208;deficient allyl bromides in the presence of 2,6&#8208;lutidine at 365 or 405 nm.

  Alkylations of simple electron&#8208;rich heterocompounds deliver valuable target structures in bioorganic and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we present a straightforward and photosensitizer free approach for the photoinduced C&#8211;C coupling of electron&#8208;rich unsaturated heterocompounds with alkyl bromides using 405 nm and 365 nm irradiation. Comprehensive mechanistic studies indicate the involvement of 2,6&#8208;lutidine in the formation of a non&#8208;covalently bound intermediate to which the function of a photosensitizer is attributed. UV/Vis spectra reveal the formation of a bathochromic shifted band when the electron&#8208;deficient alkyl bromide is mixed with the structural motif of 2,6&#8208;substituted pyridine. Upon photochemical excitation of this band, we find the initiation of the C&#8211;C bond&#8208;forming reaction. Using this approach highly versatile alkylation products, e.g. &#945;&#8208;substituted ketones and 2&#8208;substituted furan, thiophene, and pyrrole derivatives, are obtained in high selectivity. Furthermore, this synthetic methodology can be applied to access substituted indoles, which cannot be obtained by other transformations.

      <title>Mild Deprotection of Dithioacetals by TMSCl/NaI Association in CH3CN</title>
      <dc:description>
  TMSCl associated with NaI was used to deprotect various dithioacetals in CH3CN with good to excellent yields. This metal&#8208;free process can also be applied with success for the regeneration of carbonyl of O,O&#8208;acetals, O,S&#8208;oxathianes, S,N&#8208;acetals, ketimines, and hydrazones.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  A mild process using a combination of TMSCl and NaI in acetonitrile is used to regenerate carbonyl compounds from a variety of dithiane and dithiolane derivatives. This easy to handle and inexpensive protocol is also efficient to deprotect oxygenated and mixed acetals as 1,3&#8208;dioxanes, 1,3&#8208;dioxolanes and 1,3&#8208;oxathianes quantitatively. As a possible extension of this method, it was also shown that nitrogenated substrates such as hydrazones, N&#8208;tosylhydrazones, and ketimines reacted well under these conditions to give the expected ketones in high yields. The methodology proposed herein is a good alternative to the existing methods since it does not use metals, oxidants, reducing agents, acidic or basic media, and keto&#8208;products were obtained in high to excellent yields.

      <title>A Decade of Muricatacin Synthesis and Beyond</title>
      <dc:description>
  Various syntheses of both the muricatacin enantiomers and analogues adopting different strategies in the last decade are described in this review. Additionaly, the strategic use of muricatacin as starting point in synthesis of reticulatacin, cis&#8208;solamins and giganin is covered.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  In this review, we have abstracted the various syntheses of both enantiomers of muricatacin (a member of a bigger class of acetogenins, ACGs), over the last decade (2010&#8211;2020). Developments in the synthesis of various epimers, homologues, oxa&#8208;analogues, &#948;&#8208;lactones, and the furofuranone analogues are also enfolded in this review. Most of the synthesis involve chiral pool and catalytic enantioselective approaches, while a few are hinged on the use of chiral auxiliary and resolution methods. Muricatacin with orthogonally differentiated two oxy&#8208;functions also serve as a start point in the synthesis of higher molecules of the acetogenin family, for example, cis&#8208;solamins, and these have also been covered herein.

      <title>ortho&#8208;Phenylene&#8208;Based Macrocyclic Hydrocarbons Assembled Using Olefin Metathesis</title>
      <dc:description>
  Macrocycles have been assembled from vinyl&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;phenylenes using olefin metathesis. The major products are trimers with congested, twisted structures. Characterization by NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and DFT calculations show that heterochiral configurations are favored. Photophysical properties are also discussed.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  While many foldamer systems reliably fold into well&#8208;defined secondary structures, higher order structure remains a challenge. A simple strategy for the organization of folded subunits in space is to link them together within a macrocycle. Previous work has shown that o&#8208;phenylenes can be co&#8208;assembled with rod&#8208;shaped linkers into twisted macrocycles, showing an interesting synergy between folding and thermodynamically controlled macrocyclization. In these systems the foldamer units were largely decoupled from each other both conformationally and electronically. Here, we show that hydrocarbon macrocycles, with very short ethenylene linkers, can be assembled from o&#8208;phenylenes using olefin metathesis. Characterization by NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and ab initio calculations shows that the products are approximately triangular trimer macrocycles with helical o&#8208;phenylene corners in a heterochiral configuration. Their photophysics are dominated by the 4,4'&#8208;diphenylstilbene moieties, the longest conjugated segments, with further conjugation broken by the twisting of the o&#8208;phenylenes.

  &lt;p&gt;Macrocycles have been assembled from vinyl&#8208;substituted &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;phenylenes using olefin metathesis. The major products are trimers with congested, twisted structures. Characterization by NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and DFT calculations show that heterochiral configurations are favored. Photophysical properties are also discussed.
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While many foldamer systems reliably fold into well&#8208;defined secondary structures, higher order structure remains a challenge. A simple strategy for the organization of folded subunits in space is to link them together within a macrocycle. Previous work has shown that &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;phenylenes can be co&#8208;assembled with rod&#8208;shaped linkers into twisted macrocycles, showing an interesting synergy between folding and thermodynamically controlled macrocyclization. In these systems the foldamer units were largely decoupled from each other both conformationally and electronically. Here, we show that hydrocarbon macrocycles, with very short ethenylene linkers, can be assembled from &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;phenylenes using olefin metathesis. Characterization by NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and ab initio calculations shows that the products are approximately triangular trimer macrocycles with helical &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;phenylene corners in a heterochiral configuration. Their photophysics are dominated by the 4,4'&#8208;diphenylstilbene moieties, the longest conjugated segments, with further conjugation broken by the twisting of the &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;phenylenes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>
  Radical decarboxylative functionalization of redox&#8208;active esters induced by one&#8208;electron reductions (OER) has recently become a research focus in synthetic chemistry. Here we present the new advances using redox&#8208;active esters as carbon&#8208;centered radical precursors to form carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The one&#8208;electron reduction (OER) can profoundly affect the structure and reactivity of organic compounds. OER induced radical decarboxylative functionalizations of redox&#8208;active esters have gained wide concerns in this century. In this review, we present recent advances using redox&#8208;active esters as carbon&#8208;centered radical precursors to form carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds.

      <title>Mechanism and Regioselectivity of Intramolecular [2+2] Cycloaddition of Ene&#8211;Ketenes: A DFT Study</title>
      <dc:description>Intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of ene&#8211;ketenes gives either fused&#8208;ring (via normal [2+2] cycloaddition) or bridged&#8208;ring (via cross&#8208;[2+2] cycloaddition) cyclobutanones. For example, terminal ene&#8211;ketenes give the fused&#8208;ring cycloadducts, whereas dimethyl&#8208;substituted ene&#8211;ketenes furnish bridged&#8208;ring cycloadducts. For monomethyl&#8208;substituted ene&#8211;ketenes, both [2+2] cycloadducts are generated. However, there are no systematic theoretical studies on such a regiochemistry in the literature. Here we report our DFT study on the mechanism and regioselectivity of these intramolecular [2+2] cycloadditions. DFT calculations reveal that both normal and cross&#8208;[2+2] cycloadditions are concerted processes. The normal [2+2] cycloaddition transition state is forming an internal carbocation while the cross&#8208;[2+2] cycloaddition transition state is generating an external carbocation (see  Scheme 1  of the paper). On the basis of the relative stability of these carbocations, which is affected by both the tether and the substituent(s) on the alkene, a regiochemistry prediction model is proposed to understand and predict the reaction outcome.</dc:description>

      <title>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed olefination of N&#8208;tosylhydrazones as &#946;&#8208;diazo phosphonate precursors with arylhalides</title>
      <dc:description>An efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed olefination of N&#8208;tosylhydrazones as &#946;&#8208;diazo phosphonate precursors with aryl halides has been developed. 2,2&#8208;Disubstituted vinylphosphonates bearing versatile functional groups were easily accessed in moderate to excellent yields. Various aryl halides could be employed as the coupling partners, such as (hetero)arylbromides, aryliodides, and even arylchlorides. Moreover, with similar strategy (2,2&#8208;diphenylvinyl)diarylphosphine oxides can also be attained by the reaction of N&#8208;tosylhydrazones and aryl bromides. This protocol features easily available raw materials, simple reaction conditions, broad substrate scope as well as scale&#8208;up ability. Moreover, the potential application of this product was exemplified by further transformations.</dc:description>

      <title>Applications of Chiral Cyclopentadienyl (Cpx) Metal Complexes in Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Metal complexes containing cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ligands are versatile and robust catalysts widely applied in organic synthesis. During the last two decades chiral Cpx complexes have been applied in a variety of enantioselective transformations. Often associated with Group 9 metals (Co, Rh, Ir), chiral Cpx ligands have also been used in combination with early transition&#8208;metals and rare&#8208;earth elements. In this mini&#8208;review asymmetric reactions that have been successfully steered with chiral Cpx ligand metal complexes are discussed according to the metal coordinated. Several ligand designs have successfully been used in a diverse array of reactions, in particular C&#8208;H functionalisations, with binaphthyl&#8208;derived ligands leading the field. Challenges with these ligands derive from the need for their multi&#8208;step synthesis, and recently new ligands have been designed which can be accessed in shorter sequences from readily available starting materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Carbohydrate based Ionic Liquids (CHILs): Synthesis and Applications</title>
      <dc:description>Carbohydrate based ionic liquids (CHILs) are a sub&#8208;class of ionic liquids which first emerged in 2007 and has since then attracted a steadily growing community of organic chemists. Since carbohydrates are naturally occurring materials with a broad spectrum of diastereomers, they are fitting materials for ionic liquids bearing stereochemical information. This review gives an up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of all CHILs and their applications in asymmetric chemistry.</dc:description>
