      <title>Copper&#8208;catalyzed [3+2+1] annulation of anthranils with phenylacetaldehydes: Synthesis of 8&#8208;acylquinolines</title>
      <dc:description>A Cu  0  &#8208;catalyzed protocol is proposed for the synthesis of 8&#8208;acylquinolines through a [3+2+1] annulation starting from anthranils and phenylacetaldehydes. This protocol is of particular interest in preparing 8&#8208;aldehyde quinolines, which are hard to access before. Both AgOTf and dioxgen played an important role in the reaction. C3&#8208;heterocycle or phenylethylene substituted anthranils could be also employed in the reaction. An interesting esterification of aldehyde was observed.</dc:description>

The 1&#8208;CF  3  &#8208;propyne iminium ion can act as a highly reactive ambident electrophile, giving rise to simple electrophilic heteroaromatic ring substitution products, and as a 1,3&#8208;biselectrophile leading to C  2  + C  3  &#8208;CF  3  annulation products. Moreover, it is an electron&#8208;deficient alkyne which was found to afford double [2+2] cycloaddition products with 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran and 2,5&#8208;dimethylthiophene. The molecular structures so obtained include CF  3  &#8208;containing compounds with cyclopenta[  b  ]furan, cyclopenta[  b  ]thiophene, cyclopenta[  c  ]thiophene, cyclopenta[  b  ]pyrrole, cyclopenta[  c  ]pyrrole, 3  H  &#8208;pyrrolizine and 1,4&#8208;dihydrocyclopenta[  b  ]pyrrole ring systems.

      <title>Recent developments in deaminative functionalization of alkyl amines</title>
      <dc:description>The amino group is one of the most prevalent functional groups present in a wide range of organic molecules, which has been widely applied in various organic synthesis and pharmaceuticals. Alkyl amines could be converted in a single step into Katritzky salts which could serve as alkyl radical precursors to construct C&#8208;C bonds and C&#8208;X bonds via C(sp  3  )&#8208;N cleavage. This deaminative functionalization could be carried out under transition&#8208;metal catalysis, photocatalysis, carbene catalysis or base.

      <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Sulfonylureas.</title>
      <dc:description>Sulfonylureas are employed in a variety of applications including use as drugs to treat type II diabetes and as plant growth regulators or herbicides. Traditionally, the synthesis of sulfonylureas has been accomplished either by the treatment of sulfamides with isocyanates in the presence of a base&#160;or through sulfonamides conversion into  N  &#8208;sulfonyl isocyanates or  N  &#8208;sulfonyl carbamate derivatives which provide the corresponding sulfonylureas upon treatment with amines. Both the approaches are severely limited by the weak nucleophilicity of sulfamides and by the difficulty in synthesizing and handling isocyanate species. Such a drawback could be mitigated by the emergence of protocols establishing the labile electrophilic functional groups  in situ  so that their coupling with nucleophilic partners takes place one&#8208;pot. Recently, the development of environmentally friendly methods to prepare sulfonylurea containing compounds without using harmful reagents has attracted considerable attention. The aim of the minireview is to explore the different protocols emerged in the literature to generate sulfonylureas giving importance to the reaction mechanisms of crucial synthetic steps.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A thiocarbamate&#8208;directed Cp*Co(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H oxidative amidation of olefins is achieved to synthesize a series of enamines. The key feature of this protocol is the use of earth&#8208;abundant cobalt as catalyst and thiocarbamate as directing group, which provides an efficient and simple manner to synthesize enamines in good yields with high (  Z  )&#8208;selectivity. This reaction proceeds smoothly under very mild conditions (rt and air), and a wide range of functionalized alkenes as well as dioxazolones were compatible with the standard reaction conditions.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A thiocarbamate&#8208;directed Cp*Co(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H oxidative amidation of olefins is achieved to synthesize a series of enamines. The key feature of this protocol is the use of earth&#8208;abundant cobalt as catalyst and thiocarbamate as directing group, which provides an efficient and simple manner to synthesize enamines in good yields with high (  Z  )&#8208;selectivity. This reaction proceeds smoothly under very mild conditions (rt and air), and a wide range of functionalized alkenes as well as dioxazolones were compatible with the standard reaction conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>On the Origin of Regioselectivity in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidation of Glucosides</title>
      <dc:description>The palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of glucopyranosides has been investigated using relativistic density functional theory (DFT) at ZORA&#8208;BLYP&#8208;D3(BJ)/TZ2P. The complete Gibbs free energy profiles for the oxidation of secondary hydroxy groups at C2, C3, and C4 were computed for methyl &#946;&#8208;glucoside and methyl carba&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucoside. Both computations and oxidation experiments on carba&#8208;glucosides demonstrate the crucial role of the ring oxygen in the C3 regioselectivity observed during the oxidation of glucosides. Analysis of the model systems for oxidized methyl &#946;&#8208;glucoside shows that the C3 oxidation product is intrinsically favored in the presence of the ring oxygen. Subsequent energy decomposition analysis (EDA) and Hirschfeld charge analysis reveal the role of the ring oxygen: it positively polarizes C1/C5 by inductive effects and disfavors any subsequent buildup of positive charge at neighboring carbon atoms, rendering C3 the most favored site for the &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination.</dc:description>

      <title>Computational and experimental insights into asymmetric Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydrocarboxylation with CO2</title>
      <dc:description>The asymmetric Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydrocarboxylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds was originally developed by Mikami and co&#8208;workers but gives only moderate enantiomeric excesses. In order to understand the factors controlling the enantioselectivity and to propose novel ligands for this reaction, we have used computational and experimental methods to study the Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydrocarboxylation with different bidentate ligands. The analysis of the C&#8208;CO2 bond formation transition states with DFT methods shows a preference for outer sphere CO2 insertion, where CO2 can undergo a backside or frontside reaction with the nucleophile. The two ligands that prefer a frontside reaction, StackPhos and tBu&#8208;BOX, display an intriguing stacking interaction between CO2 and an N&#8208;heterocyclic ring of the ligand (imidazole or oxazoline). Our experimental results support the computationally predicted low enantiomeric excesses and highlight the difficulty in developing a highly selective version of this reaction.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Enantiopure 6,11&#8208;Methylene Lipoxin B4 Methyl Ester</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of Lipoxin B4 analogs (LXB4) to gain access to stabilized inflammation resolving compounds is an actual field of research. Focusing on variation and stabilization of the conjugated E,Z,E,E C6&#8211;C13 tetraene moiety of natural LXB4, a methylene bridge introduced between C6 and C11 suppresses any Z/E isomerization of the C8&#8211;C9 olefin. Intending to enable prospective structure variations in connection with the C1&#8211;C5 and C14&#8211;C20 fragments, a convergent total synthesis has been developed. Optically active C1&#8211;C12 building blocks were build&#8208;up from cycloheptatriene 1&#8208;carbonester (C6&#8211;C11, C21) and glutaryl chloride (C1&#8211;C5) using Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type acylation and chiral HPLC. The C13&#8208;C20 segment had been generated via a five&#8208;step sequence starting from heptanoyl chloride. Horner key olefination enabled assembly of the carbon backbone. A final five step sequence including a chelate Cram reduction of the unsaturated ketone moiety afforded the target 6,11&#8208;methylene LXB4 methyl ester.</dc:description>

      <title>Molecular Recognition by Chalcogen Bond: Selective Charge&#8208;transfer Crystal Formation of Dimethylnaphthalene with Selenadiazolotetracyanonaphthoquinodimethane</title>
      <dc:description>The title nonplanar electron acceptor ( 1 ) fused with a selenadiazole ring selectively forms a crystalline charge&#8208;transfer complex (CT crystal) with 2,6&#8208;dimethylnaphthalene (2,6&#8208;DMN). On the other hand, the sulfur analogue ( 2 ) has less recognition ability and forms CT crystals with both 2,6&#8208; and 2,7&#8208;DMN. X&#8208;ray analyses of 1 , 2 , and their CT crystals revealed that the Se &#9679;&#9679;&#9679; N chalcogen bond (ChB) in 1 is strong enough to determine the crystal packing with the formation of a cavity suitable for 2,6&#8208;DMN. On the contrary, ChB through S &#9679;&#9679;&#9679; N contact in 2 competes with other weak interactions such as a C&#8208;H &#9679;&#9679;&#9679; N hydrogen bond. The stronger ChB involving Se is the key for 1 to separate 2,6&#8208;DMN (&gt;97 wt%) from a complex isomer mixture containing ca. 10 wt% each of 2,6&#8208; and 2,7&#8208;DMN by a simple, efficient and straightforward mixing&#8208;filtration&#8208;heating process.</dc:description>

      <title>Stereochemistry of a Cyclic Epicatechin Trimer with C3 Symmetry Produced by Oxidative Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>A cyclic epicatechin trimer with  C3  symmetry, connected through C&#8211;C bonds between A&#8208; and B&#8208;rings, was isolated as an oxidative coupling product of (&#8722;)&#8208;epicatechin with polyphenol oxidase. It was previously isolated as an oxidation product of epicatechin with CuCl2; however, only the 2D structure was proposed. Its stereochemistry was assigned using various spectroscopic techniques, including 1D and 2D NMR, and theoretical calculations of the NMR and ECD data. It was suggested that the less strained cyclic trimer with the (aR,aR  ,aR) configuration was formed atroposelectively in the cyclization process.</dc:description>

      <title>Mechanistic Vistas of Trivalent Nitrogen Compound Reduction by Samarium Iodide</title>
      <dc:description>In trivalent nitrogen compounds, the nitrogen lone pair is highly amenable to bind to samarium iodide prior to electron transfer. As SmI  2  is more azaphilic than oxophilic, its affinity to the nitrogen lone pair is more pronounced in aza substrates than in the analogous carbonyl compounds. The impact of this binding is very large in terms of reaction rate and at the same time gives rise to unique mechanistic phenomena, which include unusual kinetic rate orders, catalysis by quantum dots, and remote functionalization. Even reduction of nitriles was found to be affected by this coordination to SmI  2  . This review focuses on the reduction mechanisms of three groups of compounds: imines, azobenzene, and nitriles.</dc:description>

      <title>Sulfur Tuning of [1,3]&#8208;Dioxolo[4.5&#8208;f]benzodioxole (DBD) Fluorescent Dyes</title>
      <dc:description>The replacement of oxygen by sulfur atoms of [1,3]&#8208;dioxolo[4.5&#8208;  f  ]benzodioxole (DBD) fluorescent dyes is an efficient way to adjust the photophysical properties (sulfur tuning). While previously developed S  4  &#8208;DBD dyes exhibit considerably red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission wavelength, the heavy atom effect of four sulfur atoms cause low fluorescence quantum yields and short fluorescence lifetimes. Herein we demonstrate that the replacement of less than four sulfur atoms (S  1  &#8208;DBD, 1,2&#8208;S  2  &#8208;DBD, and 1,4&#8208;S  2  &#8208;DBD dyes) permits a fine&#8208;tuning of the photophysical properties. In some cases, a similar influence on the wavelength without the detrimental effect on the quantum yields and lifetimes is observed. Furthermore, the synthetic accessibility of S  1  &#8208; and S  2  &#8208;DBD dyes is improved, compared with S  4  &#8208;DBD dyes. For coupling with biomolecules a series of reactive derivatives of the new dyes were developed (azides, OSu esters, alkynes, maleimides).</dc:description>

      <title>Allosteric guest binding in chiral zirconium(IV) double decker porphyrin cages</title>
      <dc:description>Chiral zirconium(IV) double cage sandwich complex Zr(1)2 has been synthesized in one step from porphyrin cage H21. The zirconium compound was obtained as a racemate, which was resolved by HPLC and the enantiomers were isolated in &gt;99.5% ee. Their absolute configurations were assigned on the basis of X&#8208;ray crystallography and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) experiments on the enantiomers of Zr(1)2 revealed that the chirality around the zirconium center is propagated throughout the whole cage structure. The axial conformational chirality of the double cage complex displays a VCD fingerprint similar to the one observed previously for a related chiral cage compound with planar and point chirality. Zr(1)2 shows fluorescence, which is quenched when viologen guests bind in its cavities. The binding of viologen and dihydroxybenzene derivatives in the two cavities of Zr(1)2 occurs with negative allostery the cooperativity factors &#945; (= 4K1/K2) being as low as 0.0076 for the binding of N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylviologen. These allosteric effects are attributed to a pinching of the second cavity as a result of guest binding in the first cavity.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4&#8208;dioxane derivatives are discussed.






New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between N,N&#8208;disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between &lt;i&gt;N,N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reactivity of Organic Geminal Diazides at Tetrahedral Carbons</title>
      <dc:description>
This Minireview highlights the prominent reactivities of aliphatic geminal diazide compounds, including thermolysis, photolysis, and cycloadditions, most of which yielding unique classes of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. We also present how this, still uncommon, class of compounds can be used for amide bond formation and the degradation of a carbon framework, under the action of nucleophilic amines.






Organic compounds with geminal diazide units at sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms are a widely neglected class of compounds, with regard to their synthesis and their reactivities. In the last decade, we and others started to uncover reactivity patterns with this compound class, leading to new possibilities of reaction design. This minireview covers recent developments in the field, including the generation of heterocycles through thermolysis, the reactions with nucleophilic amines, and the hydrogenation.

      <title>Metal&#8208;free Photochemical Atom Transfer Radical Addition (ATRA) of BrCCl3 to Alkenes</title>
      <dc:description>A simple, photochemical and metal&#8208;free protocol for the atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) of bromotrichloromethane onto various alkenes is described. Among a range of organic molecules, phenylglyoxylic acid proved to be the most suitable photoinitiator to promote a sustainable process for the addition of bromotrichloromethane to olefins. This photochemical atom transfer radical protocol can be expanded into a wide substrate scope of aliphatic olefins bearing various functional groups, leading to the corresponding products in good to excellent yields.</dc:description>
