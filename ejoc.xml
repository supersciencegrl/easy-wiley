The efficiency of Ara&#8208;&#946;&#8208;(1&#8594;2)&#8208;Ara p&#8208;tolyl thioglycoside with five triisopropylsilyl groups in stereoselective synthesis of tetrasaccharide corresponding to a fragment of the M. tuberculosis arabinan was shown. On the contrary, the use of glycosyl donors based on Ara&#8208;&#946;&#8208;(1&#8594;2)&#8208;Ara disaccharide with only benzoyl or both silyl and benzoyl groups led to the loss of stereocontrol.







Abstract
Formation of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;arabinofuranoside linkage in arabinans from Mycobacterium tuberculosis using differently protected Ara&#8208;&#946;&#8208;(1&#8594;2)&#8208;Ara disaccharide glycosyl donors in the absence of a participating group at O&#8208;2 was studied. The influence of the nature of the protective and leaving groups in glycosyl donors on the efficiency and stereoselectivity of the 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;arabinofuranosylation was investigated. The efficiency of Ara&#8208;&#946;&#8208;(1&#8594;2)&#8208;Ara p&#8208;tolyl thioglycoside containing five triisopropylsilyl groups in 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;stereoselective synthesis of a protected tetrasaccharide corresponding to a fragment of the M. tuberculosis arabinan was shown for the first time.

A three&#8208;component strategy promoted by iodine using &#946;&#8208;diketones/&#946;&#8208;ketoesters, ammonium thiocyanate, and aryl amines to yield 2&#8208;aminothiazoles is investigated. This protocol is notable for its operational simplicity, functional group tolerance, metal&#8208;free conditions, and short reaction times. The vitality of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by synthesizing 26 polysubstituted 2&#8208;aminothiazoles and their synthetic utility was also illustrated by the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of 2&#8208;aminothiazoles 3&#8201;aa and 3&#8201;ea.







Abstract
A one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component protocol for the synthesis of 2&#8208;aminothiazoles promoted by iodine from readily available starting materials such as &#946;&#8208;diketones/&#946;&#8208;ketoesters, arylamines, and NH4SCN has been developed. A wide range of arylamines was tolerated well to produce the expected polysubstituted 2&#8208;aminothiazoles in moderate to good yields. The characteristic features of this methodology include operational ease, metal&#8208;free reaction conditions, gram&#8208;scale scalability, functional group tolerance, and short reaction times.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 46, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;pincer complexes acted as the efficient earth&#8208;abundant cooperative catalysts for the transfer hydrogenation of assorted aldehydes and ketones including a few biologically relevant substrates using isopropanol as the hydrogen source. A combination of binding studies, Hammett plot, kinetic studies and DFT calculations supported the outer&#8208;sphere reaction mechanism.







Abstract
Cobalt complexes of amide&#8208;based ligands appended with protonated heterocyclic rings are utilized as the earth&#8208;abundant catalysts for the transfer hydrogenation of assorted carbonyl compounds using isopropanol as the hydrogen source. The most successful complex illustrated remarkable catalytic performance towards a wide range of aldehydes and ketones, quantitatively yielding primary and secondary alcohols as the products, respectively. The catalysis scope also included a few biologically relevant substrates such as furfural, vanillin, ortho&#8208;vanillin, coumarin and chalcone. The substrate binding, Hammett, kinetic and DFT studies provided the mechanistic insights.

         <dc:description>
A remarkably effective, eco sustainable solvent&#8208;free method has been reported for the Hydrogen transfer to produce a fluorescent aromatic compound with satisfactory to good yields. This methodology covers a wide range of substrates, and the synthesized compounds have superior fluorescence properties, so the photophysical and biological properties are investigated.







Abstract
Herein we report an organocatalytic synthesis of highly fluorescent naphthalene derivatives through hydrogen atom transfer featuring neat and mild reaction conditions under air with high substrate tolerance along with atom economy by the unprecedented use of DBU, where oxidation and reduction occurred in one&#8208;pot. Synthesized compounds are utilized in photophysical studies, cytotoxic studies and cell imaging studies of colon cancer cell line CT26.

         <title>C(spn)&#8722;X (n=1&#8211;3) Bond Activation by Iron</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 46, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doing more with less! Our quantum chemical analyses reveal that the activity of a model iron catalyst towards C&#8722;X bond activation becomes easier from ethane to ethylene to acetylene because the steric repulsion between catalyst and substrate becomes less destabilizing as the number of substituents around the carbon atom decreases.







Abstract
The iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidative addition of C(spn)&#8722;X bonds (n=1&#8211;3 and X=H, CH3, Cl) in archetypal model substrates H3C&#8722;CH2&#8722;X, H2C=CH&#8722;X and HC&#8801;C&#8722;X to Fe(CO)4 was investigated using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;OPBE/TZ2P. The C(spn)&#8722;X bonds become substantially stronger going from C(sp3)&#8722;X to C(sp2)&#8722;X to C(sp)&#8722;X, whereas the oxidative addition reaction barrier decreases along this series. Our activation strain and energy decomposition analyses expose that the decreased reaction barrier for the oxidative addition going from sp3 to sp2 to sp stems from a relief of the destabilizing (steric) Pauli repulsion between the catalyst and substrate. This originates from the decreasing coordination number of the carbon atom that goes from four in C(sp3)&#8722;X to three in C(sp2)&#8722;X to two in C(sp)&#8722;X. In analogy with our previous results on palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative additions, this enhances the stabilizing catalyst&#8211;substrate interaction, which is able to overcome the more destabilizing strain associated with the stronger C(spn)&#8722;X bonds.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Doing more with less&lt;/b&gt;! Our quantum chemical analyses reveal that the activity of a model iron catalyst towards C&#8722;X bond activation becomes easier from ethane to ethylene to acetylene because the steric repulsion between catalyst and substrate becomes less destabilizing as the number of substituents around the carbon atom decreases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iron-catalyzed oxidative addition of C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;X bonds (n=1&#8211;3 and X=H, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Cl) in archetypal model substrates H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&#8722;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;X, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=CH&#8722;X and HC&#8801;C&#8722;X to Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; was investigated using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA-OPBE/TZ2P. The C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;X bonds become substantially stronger going from C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;X to C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;X to C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;)&#8722;X, whereas the oxidative addition reaction barrier decreases along this series. Our activation strain and energy decomposition analyses expose that the decreased reaction barrier for the oxidative addition going from &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt; stems from a relief of the destabilizing (steric) Pauli repulsion between the catalyst and substrate. This originates from the decreasing coordination number of the carbon atom that goes from four in C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;X to three in C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;X to two in C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;)&#8722;X. In analogy with our previous results on palladium-catalyzed oxidative additions, this enhances the stabilizing catalyst&#8211;substrate interaction, which is able to overcome the more destabilizing strain associated with the stronger C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;X bonds. This work again demonstrates that iron-based catalysts can resemble the behavior of their well-known palladium analogs in the oxidative addition step of cross-coupling reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A solvent&#8208;free organocatalyzed intermolecular cyclization reaction starting from &#946;&#8208;substituted &#947;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters and aryl isothiocyanates proceeds via an aza&#8208;Michael addition to provide previously unknown quaternary oxazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thione &#946;3&#8208;amino ester analogs. A panel of diversely&#8208;substituted esters was investigated, including &#946;,&#947;&#8208;disubstituted examples which provided the target molecules with very high cis diastereoselectivity.

         <dc:description>
In this manuscript, copper&#8208;catalyzed transformations of oxime ethers and sulfonyl azides were carried out to efficiently afford isoxazolidine. The reaction involved the tandem CuAAC/ring cleavage/ rare 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization procedures under mild condition. This methodology appears quite flexible and offers a capacity to generate the 2&#8208;vinyl isoxazolidine products.

         <dc:description>
Under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, a series of thiocarbamide esters could be quickly and conveniently obtained by NaOH&#8208;promotion in one pot manner. It's noteworthy that the desired products could be obtained in moderate to excellent yields from inexpensive and easily available starting materials, providing an alternative way to afford various thiocarbamide esters.







Abstract
A convenient and effective method for the construction of C&#8722;S bond under transition&#8208;metal free conditions was reported. Thus, diverse thiocarbamide esters could be smoothly obtained in moderate to good yields from inexpensive and readily available starting materials, such as phenyl isothiocyanate, alcohols and benzyl halides. This method features mild conditions, easy operation, short reaction time and broad substrate scopes, providing a facile and convenient strategy for the preparation of some compounds with potential biological activities.

         <dc:description>Herein, we investigated a new organophotocatalyzed protocol enabling the preparation of 3&#8208;substituted phthalides. From this work, the 1,2,3,5&#8208;Tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene&#160; (4CzIPN) turned out to be a particularly efficient organophotocatalyst to promote lactone formation under visible&#8208;light irradiation within 6h. The methodology was extended to nineteen diversly substituted phthalides with yields ranging from 23 to 81%. Ultimately, it was found that this protocol could enable the formation of racemic herbaric acid.</dc:description>

The methodology was extended to nineteen diversly substituted phthalides with yields ranging from 23 to 81%. Ultimately, it was found that this protocol could enable the formation of racemic herbaric acid.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid Promoted Sulfonylation of Propargylic Alcohols: Synthesis of Triaryl Allenyl Sulfones under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and practical approach&#160;for&#160;the generation of&#160;triaryl allenyl sulfones from easily accessible propargylic alcohols with sodium sulfinates as&#160;a&#160;sulfonyl source in the presence of Br&#248;nsted acid was developed in this work. The reaction proceeded&#160;via&#160;allenyl carbocation as the key intermediate and was followed by a nucleophilic attack of sodium sulfinates to produce allenyl sulfones in moderate to excellent yields. The obvious advantages of this reaction are the mild conditions, operational simplicity, good yield, a wide functional group tolerance, and gram&#8208;scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Catalysis in Organic Synthesis: Current Challenges and New Trends</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual catalysis is one of the most powerful strategies for the development of chemical reactions in organic synthesis. This Perspective aims to introduce the different categories of dual catalytic systems and demonstrate their benefits in constructing new chemical bonds and enhanced stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Dual catalysis is one of the most powerful strategies for the development of chemical reactions in organic synthesis. This strategy can be divided into cooperative catalysis, relay catalysis, and sequential catalysis according to the actual mode of operation and the communication between the catalysts. In recent years, such strategy has been applied in a large number of studies since it has the advantages of: 1)&#8197;increasing reactivity and enabling challenging transformations; 2)&#8197;offering a powerful way of controlling the stereoselectivity of asymmetric reactions, which is challenging for traditional catalytic systems; 3)&#8197;catalyze the stereodivergent synthesis of molecules bearing one or more stereocenters from the same starting materials. This Perspective, which intends to introduce the reader to EurJOC special collection on Dual Catalysis , aims to summarize and introduce the different categories of dual catalysis and demonstrate their benefits in constructing new chemical bonds in a selective manner. Finally, current challenges and new trends in dual catalysis will be also presented.

         <dc:description>A novel efficient method for the synthesis of licochalcone C in good yield on up to 30 g scale was developed. The reaction sequence included relied on the directed ortho&#8208;metalation (DOM) of bis&#8208;O&#8208;MOM&#8208;protected resorcinol for the regioselective C&#8208;prenylation, followed by metalation &#8211; formylation, selective O&#8208;deprotection of a hydroxyl group located between the formyl and prenyl groups, its methylation, and aldol reaction with p&#8208;hydroxyacetophenone.

         <title>Stereoselective Domino Heck&#8208;Suzuki Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium catalysis enables efficient and versatile domino reactions that are initiated by an intramolecular Mizoroki&#8208;Heck reaction and then terminated by a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling. The stereochemistry of this cascade is concerned under three aspects: Firstly, as stereoselective formation of carbon&#8208;carbon&#8208;double bonds, when the initial carbometalation occurs at an alkyne moiety. Secondly as diastereoselective and thirdly enantioselective formation of stereogenic carbon centers when the intramolecular Heck step is directed to an alkene moiety. Valuable protocols lead to &#8211; otherwise not easily accomplished &#8211; stereo control in the formation of tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted double bonds according to the first conception. The diastereoselective versions permit the formation of multiple stereocenters in mono&#8208; and polycycles. Enantioselective protocols were developed only recently. The fact that the newly created stereocenters are highly&#8208;substituted, tertiary or quaternary ones, makes the methods that are presented in this review useful and versatile tools in synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Three Complementary One&#8208;Pot Four&#8208;Component Reaction Sequences for Rapid, General and Direct Spiropyran Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three distinct one&#8208;pot three&#8208;step four&#8208;component processes for spiropyran synthesis were developed. These complementary reaction sequences enable efficient and straightforward synthesis of structurally diverse spiropyrans from simple and readily available precursors.







Abstract
Three one&#8208;pot three&#8208;step four&#8208;component reaction sequences for spiropyran synthesis have been developed, based around three different methods for in situ generation of 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted indoles (indole N&#8208;alkylation, Fischer indolisation and indole C&#8208;alkylation). The reaction sequences give access to a broad swathe of spiropyran structures. Each sequence is operationally straightforward, rapid and high yielding. We have synthesized 58 structurally diverse spiropyrans bearing a wide range of useful functional groups, and their utility were demonstrated in the targeted synthesis of potential ratiometric fluorescence probes for metal ions and spiropyran&#8208;cholesterol conjugates. Finally, we showed that our one&#8208;pot N&#8208;alkylation&#8208;C&#8208;alkylation&#8208;condensation sequence can underpin combinatorial spiropyran synthesis through generation of a 16&#8208;member spiropyran library.

         <dc:description>
The Front Cover illustrates the contrast between conventional and electrochemical bromination in terms of sustainability and safety. In the background on the left, hazardous bromine represents the conventional brominating agents. On the right, sodium bromide represents a safer and sustainable bromine surrogate, which can be electrochemically generated in situ for the bromination of renewable entities, such as limonene. The green electricity plug demonstrates the superiority of electrochemistry by providing a greener alternative to the conventional bromination methods with high selectivity. Cover design by M. D&#246;rr and L. Gombos. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. R. Waldvogel et&#8197;al.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Front Cover&lt;/b&gt; illustrates the contrast between conventional and electrochemical bromination in terms of sustainability and safety. In the background on the left, hazardous bromine represents the conventional brominating agents. On the right, sodium bromide represents a safer and sustainable bromine surrogate, which can be electrochemically generated in situ for the bromination of renewable entities, such as limonene. The green electricity plug demonstrates the superiority of electrochemistry by providing a greener alternative to the conventional bromination methods with high selectivity. Cover design by M. D&#246;rr and L. Gombos. More information can be found in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ejoc.202200857"&gt;Research Article by S. R. Waldvogel et&#8197;al&lt;/a&gt;.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Chemistry for Synthesis and Co&#8208;conformational Control of Mechanically Interlocked Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient synthesis of mechanical bonds is a huge challenge. Dynamic covalent chemistry is one of the most efficient methods for forming rotaxanes, catenanes and molecular knots in high yields. This Review reports recent uses of reversible covalent bonds to synthesize mechanically interlocked molecules, and discusses how dynamic bonds can be used to control motion in interlocked molecular machinery.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules have found extensive applications in areas all across the physical sciences, from materials to catalysis and sensing. However, introducing mechanical bonds and entanglements at the molecular level is still a significant challenge due to the inherent restriction in entropy needed to preorganize strands before interlocking. Over the last decade, dynamic covalent chemistry has emerged as one of the most efficient methods of forming rotaxanes, catenanes and molecular knots. By using reversible bonds such as imines, disulfides and boronate esters, one can use the inherent error&#8208;correction in these linkages to form interlocked architectures with high fidelity and often in excellent yields. This review reports on recent advances in the use of dynamic covalent chemistry to make mechanically interlocked molecules, systematically surveying clipping, capping and templating approaches with dynamic bonds. Furthermore, it is also discussed how dynamic bonds can be used to control motion, co&#8208;conformational expression and catalytic activity in mechanically interlocked molecular machinery.

The combination of photoredox catalysis with transition metal catalysis opened new avenues in research. This Review highlights recent developments in photochemical cross&#8208;coupling reactions enabled by C(sp3)&#8722;H homolytic cleavage, leading to challenging C&#8722;C transformations.







Abstract
Over the past decade with the relaunch of photochemistry, photochemical cross&#8208;coupling reactions became an excellent tool for the formation of C&#8722;C bond under mild reaction conditions. C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of inert substrates, combined with modern transition metal catalysis, provides a powerful tool in organic synthesis. A variety of elegant strategies to initiate a HAT event have been developed, generating alkyl radicals that can be easily intersected with a metal. This review conceptualizes the recent developments in this area, linking them with the seminal contributions that pioneered this research field.

Synthesis of phenothiazine&#8208;based D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D type red&#8208;emitting molecules displaying excellent AIEE, reversible mechanofluorochromism, positive solvatochromism, and large Stokes shifts is described. These thermally stable dyes have low band gap energies (Eg=1.84&#8211;2.15&#8197;eV) and display acidochromism in both, solution and solid state and detect TFA as low as 15.8&#8197;ppm.







Abstract
We report on a series of phenothiazine&#8208;based D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D type cross&#8208;conjugated non&#8208;doped red&#8208;emitting molecules synthesized by simple Claisen&#8208;Schmidt condensation, which exhibit excellent AIEE phenomena through the formation of large&#8208;sized nano&#8208;aggregates. These thermally stable red fluorescent organic materials have low band gap energies (Eg=1.84&#8211;2.15&#8197;eV) and also display reversible mechanofluorochromism. The CIE chromaticity coordinates of red emissive ground powders were closer to the standard red&#8208;light chromaticity coordinates. These chalcones also exhibited positive solvatochromism, and large Stokes shifts. Finally, these compounds were utilized as reversible volatile acid sensors to detect TFA in solution as well as in solid state, by virtue of the presence of electron withdrawing carbonyl oxygen, and they could detect TFA at a concentration as low as 15.8&#8197;ppm in the presence of C4.

         <title>Improving Site Selectivity in Phosphorylation of Amphiphilic Diols through Catalyst Design</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 46, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleophilic organocatalysts favor phosphorylation at the apolar site of a model amphiphilic diol. The best site selectivity (3.9&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio of the monophosphorylated products) is achieved with a catalyst incorporating a 4&#8208;(methylamino)pyridine active core and an amine&#8208;bound o,o&#8208;dialkoxybenzyl substituent with two lipophilic branched tails constituting the outer sphere of the catalyst.







Abstract
Organocatalysts based on a nucleophilic core, decorated with long hydrocarbon or oligoether outer&#8208;sphere tails were successfully applied for attenuating the site selectivity in phosphorylation of a model amphiphilic diol. Under the influence of the catalysts, the preference for the first functionalization of the hydroxyl at the apolar domain increased dramatically to render the ratio up to 3.9&#8201;:&#8201;1 between the monophosphorylated products, at 50&#8201;% substrate consumption (vs. 1.8&#8201;:&#8201;1 in the alike reaction without the catalyst). A considerable influence of the catalyst design, particularly the core nature and the tails structure, on the rate and the selectivity of the reaction was observed.

         <title>Synthetic Exploration of Novel Sulfamoyl Cyanide N&#8208;Oxides in Heterocycle Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 46, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The earlier introduced CH&#8208;diazomethane sulfonamides were transformed into sulfamoyl cyanide N&#8208;oxides. The latter dimerized to give furoxanes or underwent cycloaddition with olefins and alkynes to give isooxazolines and isoxazoles, respectively.







Abstract
Treatment of CH&#8208;diazomethane sulfonamides with tert&#8208;butyl nitrite produces novel sulfamoyl cyanide N&#8208;oxides which dimerize to form furoxanes. When the reaction is performed in the presence of a dipolarophile, an olefin or an alkyne, dipolar cycloaddition takes place to deliver isoxazolines or isoxazoles, respectively.

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Catalyzed Acyl&#8208;Group Exchange Reaction of Carboxylic Acids and an Aroyl Fluoride</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 46, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphine&#8208;catalyzed acyl&#8208;group exchange reaction between carboxylic acids and an aroyl fluoride has been developed. A variety of acyl fluorides are directly obtained from carboxylic acids through a catalytic system composed of tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy3) and 2,6&#8208;difluorobenzoyl fluoride as a novel deoxyfluorination reagent.







Abstract
Acyl fluorides show unique reactivity and stability, and the catalytic conversions using acyl fluorides as a divergent building block have recently attracted much attention and have been rapidly researched. Thus, a development of a new synthetic method of acyl fluorides is constantly demanded. Herein, we describe a phosphine&#8208;catalyzed acyl&#8208;group exchange reaction between carboxylic acids and an aroyl fluoride. A variety of acyl fluorides are directly obtained from carboxylic acids through a catalytic system composed of tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy3) and 2,6&#8208;difluorobenzoyl fluoride. This report is the first example of utilizing an acyl fluoride as a deoxyfluorination reagent.

         <title>20&#960; Antiaromatic Isophlorins without Metallation or Core Modification
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 46, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, the synthesis of free&#8208;base (metal&#8208;free) isophlorins with 20&#960; antiaromatic character was achieved without core modification. The reduction of &#946;&#8208;tetracyanoporphyrins by hydrazine under aerobic conditions yielded isophlorins. These 18&#960; aromatic porphyrin/20&#960; antiaromatic isophlorin redox interconversions are reversible.







Abstract
Isophlorins (two&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced porphyrins) with 20&#960; antiaromaticity have been synthesized by metallation or core modification (replacing the inner NHs with less bulky atoms) thus far. The core&#8208;modification number (CMN) is an important factor for the stability of isophlorins against their oxidation to porphyrins. However, isophlorins with small CMN (&#8804;2), i.&#8201;e., without significant core modification, are difficult to synthesize and important for understanding their structure&#8211;antiaromaticity relationships. Herein, we report the synthesis of free&#8208;base (metal&#8208;free) antiaromatic isophlorins with no core modification (CMN=0) for the first time. &#946;&#8208;Tetracyanoporphyrins were successfully reduced by hydrazine to their corresponding isophlorins under aerobic conditions. These porphyrin/isophlorin transformations are reversible. Their structure and antiaromaticity were studied via 1H&#8197;NMR, UV&#8208;vis/near&#8208;infrared absorption spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction and theoretical calculations.

The Cover Feature illustrates a phosphine&#8208;catalyzed acyl&#8208;group exchange reaction between carboxylic acids and an aroyl fluoride, which is linked to a capsule toy machine and the interchange of capsules of each color. By the addition of the phosphine catalyst (P) into a reaction system that contains a carboxylic acid (RCOOH) and an aroyl fluoride (ArCOF), a new acyl fluoride (RCOF) and a carboxylic acid (ArCOOH) are obtained through the acyl&#8208;group exchange.

This method may be used for the synthesis of bicyclic 2-pyridinones, as well as multi-substituted complex 2-pyridinones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Stereoselective Multicomponent Reactions for the Synthesis of Spiro Derivatives: Recent Progress</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 46, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic stereoselective synthesis of spiro compounds is a challenging task for organic chemists. This Review discusses recent advances in catalytic stereoselective, multicomponent reaction&#8208;based methods for the synthesis of spiro compounds. Advantages, limitations, and mechanistic aspects are also highlighted.







Abstract
Spiro derivatives are important scaffolding substances found in many natural products and pharmaceuticals. In the last decade, numerous new approaches based on multicomponent reactions have been explored for the selective and efficient development of new spiro derivatives using various organocatalytic and transition metal&#8208;based catalytic systems. This Review discusses pioneering advances in the field of catalytic stereoselective multicomponent reactions for the preparation of various spiro derivatives. These include stereoselective Michael cascade cyclization reactions, cycloadditions, diastereoselective reactions, and miscellaneous reactions for the synthesis of spiro&#8208;hetero/carbocycles. Advances in the last decade have made it possible to synthesize various spiro compounds with good to excellent stereoselectivity under appropriate reaction conditions. However, achieving high regioselectivity in several described multicomponent reactions remains a challenge. Organocatalysts and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts play a crucial role in achieving this milestone. Proposed catalytic mechanisms and supporting evidence are highlighted in this Review. The progress described in catalytic stereoselective approaches for spiro derivatives is immense. However, it is expected that new stereoselective synthetic methods will soon be developed that can be widely used for the preparation of spiro&#8208;heterocycles/carbocycles.

         <title>Persulfate&#8208;Mediated Oxidative C&#8722;H Functionalization of Glycinates to Access Diverse Unnatural Amino Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 46, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free and an operationally simple radical&#8208;mediated reaction was developed to access diversified unnatural amino acids with alkyl carboxylic acids, H&#8208;phosphonates and H&#8208;phosphinates by using persulfate as the sole oxidizing agent. The overall reaction proceeds via oxidative generation of iminium ion from glycine derivatives followed by radical addition of alkyl and phosphonyl groups to yield &#945;&#8208;alkyl and &#945;&#8208;phosphonyl glycine derivatives.







Abstract
We have developed an operationally simple and green approach to prepare robust &#945;&#8208;alkyl unnatural amino acids through the dual oxidative activation of glycine derivatives and alkylcarboxylic acids with persulfate as the sole oxidizing agent. This method allows for the utilization of naturally abundant alkylcarboxylic acids as radical sources without the assistance of catalysts. Notably, this method allows for the late&#8208;stage decoration of biologically relevant carboxylic acids and peptides to construct diverse unnatural amino acids. In addition, the generality of the oxidative activation method enables a facile synthetic approach to &#945;&#8208;phosphonyl glycine derivatives by using phosphites and phosphine oxides.

         <title>HBF4&#8208;Catalyzed 3,6&#8208;Bis&#8208;diarylmethylation of Carbazoles with para&#8208;Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 46, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atom&#8208;economical, selective and a general acid&#8208;catalyzed method has been developed to access mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;diarylmethylated carbazole derivatives under mild conditions. This transformation proceeds through a selective 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition of carbazoles to p&#8208;quinone methides. The photophysical studies on some of the 3,6&#8208;bis&#8208;diarylated carbazoles revealed that these molecules exhibit fluorescence properties and thus, could be used in OLEDs.







Abstract
In this article, we demonstrate an atom economical, practical, mild and selective HBF4&#8208;catalyzed 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition of carbazoles to para&#8208;Quinone Methides (p&#8208;QMs) to access 3,6&#8208;bis&#8208;diarylmethyl&#8208; and mono&#8208;diarylmethyl carbazoles. This metal and additive free protocol provides convenient access to the substituted carbazole derivatives in moderate to excellent yields with a good functional group tolerance. It was found that a couple of 3,6&#8208;disubstituted carbazoles showed interesting photophysical properties and, therefore, might potentially find some applications as host materials in OLEDs.

         <title>Iodine Promoted Synthesis of S&#8208;Benzoazolyl Chromones by a Three&#8208;Component One&#8208;Pot Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 46, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical approach for the synthesis of S&#8208;benzoazolyl chromones was reported. Using iodine as oxidant, 2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl enaminones, tetramethylthiuram disulfide and 2&#8208;aminophenol as starting materials, various S&#8208;benzoazolyl chromones could be obtained by a one&#8208;pot manner.







Abstract
In the presence of iodine, the synthesis of S&#8208;benzoazolyl chromone derivatives by one&#8208;pot manner is reported. Thus, 2&#8208;aminophenol firstly reacted with tetramethylthiuram disulfide (TMTD) to form 2&#8208;mercaptobenzoxazole, and then coupled with 2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl enaminones to obtain S&#8208;benzoazolyl chromones through one&#8208;pot manner. This method features mild conditions, easy operation, environmentally friendliness and wide substrate scopes, illustrating practical application value in organic synthesis.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Photocatalysis for the Direct C&#8208;H Trifluoromethylation of Heterocycles with an Organic Photoredox Catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalysis for direct C&#8208;H trifluoromethylation represents an ideal way to synthesize trifluoromethyl&#8208;containing chemical compounds, but the conventional batch processes are inefficient with limited light penetration and indispensably irradiated for a long while. Herein, we report a continuous&#8208;flow protocol for photocatalytic direct C&#8208;H trifluoromethylation of heterocycles in the presence of an organic photoredox catalyst: 2,4,6&#8208;tris(diphenylamino)&#8208;3,5&#8208;difluorobenzonitrile (3DPA2FBN). In this approach, benefiting from the merger of organic photoredox catalysis and continuous&#8208;flow techniques, a variety of trifluoromethylated heterocycles were rapidly synthesized up to 85% yield with 80 min residence time under metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Studies on the Bidentate Lewis Acid Catalyzed Domino Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8208;Alder / Thiol Transfer Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, we presented a novel enantioselective multicomponent reaction of phthalazines, aldehydes and thiols accessing thioether&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes. Herein, a comprehensive investigation on the mechanism of this domino inverse electron&#8208;demand (IEDDA) / thiol transfer reaction is disclosed. In particular, the origin of the stereochemical outcome has been rationalized, as well as structural requirement of the thiol component for an efficient transfer step. Detailed NMR spectroscopy studies uncover a competing reaction pathway resulting in N,S&#8208;acetals. In addition, DFT computations illuminate the mechanism of the group transfer process and enable an explanation for the formation of the most dominant by&#8208;product. The insights allow a direct prediction of suitable substrates for the reaction and provide the basis for further developments of novel stereoselective domino reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Amphiphilic Iminosugar Pharmacological Chaperones towards &#946;&#8208;Glucocerebrosidase: Self&#8208;Assembly and Biological Activity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pharmacological chaperones (PCs) are new therapeutics for protein misfolding diseases, and amphiphilic PCs perform best in Gaucher Disease patients&#8217; cell lines. With the aim of investigating the biological activity vs aggregation behaviour of a new N&#8208;alkylated iminosugar&#8208;based PC, a complete physicochemical study in solution and in the solid state was performed, which ruled out a self&#8208;assembly based multivalent effect.







Abstract
Pharmacological chaperones (PCs) can restore correct enzymatic activity at sub&#8208;inhibitory concentrations and are considered an emerging therapy for Gaucher Disease (GD). Amphiphilic PCs show more favourable cross&#8208;membrane properties and have a higher activity on cells than hydrophilic PCs. To investigate whether the biological activity of amphiphilic iminosugars is related to their state as monomers or as micellar aggregates, we synthesized some novel N&#8208;alkylated iminosugars and performed physico&#8208;chemical characterizations in the solid state and in aqueous dispersion of the best compound in terms of biological activity. The results suggest that the C12 N&#8208;alkylated iminosugar 10 exerts its biological activity in the monomeric state, and that the low cell viability observed in the presence of a 50&#8197;&#956;M concentration of compound 10 is not related to the formation of micellar aggregates in solution.

&lt;p&gt;Pharmacological chaperones (PCs) can restore correct enzymatic activity at sub-inhibitory concentrations and are considered an emerging therapy for Gaucher Disease (GD). Amphiphilic PCs show more favourable cross-membrane properties and have a higher activity on cells than hydrophilic PCs. To investigate whether the biological activity of amphiphilic iminosugars is related to their state as monomers or as micellar aggregates, we synthesized some novel &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkylated iminosugars and performed physico-chemical characterizations in the solid state and in aqueous dispersion of the best compound in terms of biological activity. The results suggest that the C12 &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkylated iminosugar &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt; exerts its biological activity in the monomeric state, and that the low cell viability observed in the presence of a 50&#8197;&#956;M concentration of compound &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt; is not related to the formation of micellar aggregates in solution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multicomponent Synthesis of Purines and Pyrimidines: From the Origin of Life to New Sustainable Approaches for Drug&#8208;Discovery Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is widely accepted that purines and pyrimidines, the building blocks that gave origin to life on our planet, were created through multicomponent reactions (MCRs) on early abiotic Earth. These heterocyclic scaffolds gradually evolved into a wide range of biologically relevant molecules regulating many different physiological processes and thus becoming widely exploited as templates for the development of new drugs. Accordingly, over the years, the synthetic community has dedicated many efforts in the attempt to hypothesize and replicate the original abiotic synthesis of purines and pyrimidines, thus developing a number of multicomponent synthesis to access these scaffolds. The following evolution of synthetic chemistry towards green approaches for the production of new molecules and the recent interest in pharmaceutical sustainability underlines the importance of multicomponent synthesis of new heterocycles. This review article provides an overview of the most important multicomponent approaches for the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine derivatives for potential pharmacological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Green Approach for N&#8210;H Functionalization of Sulfoximines: An Access to Sulfoximinated&#8208;Oxime Conjugates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple, metal&#8208;free and green approach has been established for N&#8210;H functionalization of sulfoximines under mild reaction conditions to offer sulfoximinated&#8208;oxime conjugates. The reaction works well in EtOH at room temperature and proceeds smoothly without using any base or expensive ligands. This protocol has been applied on various aryl&#8208;, heteroaryl&#8208; sulfoximines as well as on variety of chloro&#8208;oximes. Both the substrates tolerated a wide range of functional groups resulted in good to excellent yields. It can serve as a directing group in organic synthesis, as precursor or building block, demonstrating the product&#8217;s applicability and importance in the field. The applications of the protocol have been demonstrated in the sulfoximination of some natural products. This strategy could be useful in drug discovery or medicinal chemistry for fine&#8208;tuning the physicochemical properties of natural product scaffolds or lead candidates.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Oxetanes Based on the Combination of Azides and Tetrazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several new energetic oxetane derivatives with higher nitrogen contents than previously reported in the literature were synthesized and characterized. An azide group and a tetrazole moiety were introduced into the starting material oxetan&#8208;3&#8208;one to obtain a 3&#8208;disubstituted oxetane. The tetrazole ring of this energetic oxetane was further methylated, aminated and hydroxylated.







Abstract
Literature known energetic oxetane derivatives have a nitrogen content of up to 49.98&#8201;%. Through the introduction of azide and tetrazole functionalities attached to an oxetane ring, energetic oxetanes with higher nitrogen contents than previously reported in the literature were obtained. The newly synthesized oxetane derivatives were extensively characterized via 1H NMR, 13C{1H} NMR, 14N NMR, 15N NMR, 1H&#8208;15N HMBC, FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy and/or DTA. Their crystal structures were elucidated using X&#8208;ray diffraction, their sensitivities towards impact, friction and electrostatic discharge were determined and their energetic properties were calculated using the EXPLO5 code.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photochemical method based on visible&#8208;light (white LEDs/sunlight) irradiation has been developed for the regioselective and oxidative C(sp2)&#8208;H selenylation and sulfenylation of substituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,4&#8208;naphthaquinones at an oxygen atmosphere. The photochemical process does not require any external photoredox catalysts. The other notable advantages of this protocol are metal&#8208;free synthesis, visible light/sunlight as energy sources, good substrate scope, and moderate to good yields (41&#8208;91%) with high regioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Strategies for Versatile Thioester Building Blocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thioester constitutes a fundamentally unique intermediate, engaged in various biosynthesis processes in living systems as well as a versatile synthon in modern organic synthesis. Transition metal catalysis and radical reaction manifolds have enabled to enrich the repertoire of synthetic methods for thioesters. In this review, we have accommodated the recent reports on modern strategies towards thioester synthesis from a plethora of readily available feedstocks, such as alkenes, alkynes, alcohols, phenols or commodity chemicals/synthetic building blocks like organic aldehydes, halides or organoboron reagents under various catalysis domains. Furthermore, the momentous advancements of employing progenitors of odorous thiols as well as CO&#8208;surrogates have contextually been emphasized, alongside the utilization of native free thiols and CO gas.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Enamides through Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Amidation of Conjugated Olefins with 2&#8208;Pyridones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative amidation of conjugated olefin with 2&#8208;pyridone is described. A series of E&#8208;Enamides were synthesized in a highly stereocontrolled manner. The reaction also accommodates other cyclic and acyclic amides. Z&#8208;Enamides were predominantly prepared for primary amides probably due to the presence of an intramolecular hydrogen bond. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis of enamide and the following oxidative annulation with diphenylacetylene demonstrates the synthetic utility of this reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyridine&#8208;Boryl Radical Mediated Decarboxylative Homolytic Substitution of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide Ester with Ar2X2 (X=S, Se)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a metal&#8208;free approach to construct C&#8208;X (X=S, Se) bonds with the broadly available N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters and disulfides/diselenides (Ar2X2,X = S or Se) using bis(pinacolato)diboron as the reductant. Density functional theory calculations and control experiments reveal that such a C&#8208;X bond formation process is reductive decarboxylationmediated from pyridine&#8208;boryl radical to yield alkyl or aryl radical. The resulting carbon radical then reacts with disulfides or diselenides via a bimolecular homolytic substitution (SH2) mechanism to afford the corresponding sulfides or selenides. This method displays a high functional group tolerance and broad substrate applicability.</dc:description>

         <title>ortho&#8208;Quinols in (Bio)Synthesis of Natural Products</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>6&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxycyclohexa&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienone derivatives, commonly referred to as&#160;ortho&#8208;quinols, and their simple ester and ether variants constitute a class of organic compounds that aroused much interest amongst chemists over the past 70 years for several reasons related to organic synthesis, natural product chemistry and biochemistry. It was very early on that organic chemists understood the potential of the unique yet versatile chemical reactivity of such compounds to synthesize more complex structures, and it soon emerged that&#160;ortho&#8208;quinols could constitute key intermediates in the biosynthesis of certain natural products of various origins. This minireview discusses the chemistry of&#160;ortho&#8208;quinols from the point of view of their role in the synthesis and biosynthesis of natural products.&#160;Examples of completed syntheses of natural products mostly taken in the literature of the last 20 years or so, together with some chosen pieces from older but pioneering and most remarkable works,&#160;are highlighted to illustrate this discussion.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Catellani Reaction with 1,1&#8208;Bis[(pinacolato)boryl]methane as the Nucleophilic Component</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein the application of 1,1&#8208;bis[(pinacolato)boryl]methane as a new type of terminating reagents to realize three&#8208;component coupling reaction with aryl iodide and different electrophiles. A series of ortho&#8208;disubstituted benzylboronates can be synthesized and the ortho&#8208;substituent can be varied by using bromoacetic esters or O&#8208;benzoyl hydroxylamine as electrophiles with slightly modified reaction conditions. The reaction shows good functional group tolerance and the obtained benzyl boronate products can be easily transformed to various synthetically useful compounds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Hydroxy amides are an essential class of compounds found in natural products and bioactive molecules of drug candidates. Herein we report a facile and direct approach to these compounds through oxalic acid decarbonylation/decarboxylation during the Passerini three&#8208;component reaction (P&#8208;3CR) under solvent&#8208;free conditions, with microwave heating. This very convenient methodology provides the title compounds through a possible concerted intramolecular decarbonylation/decarboxylation from the &#945;&#8208;acyloxy amide intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Origins of the Reactivity in 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions of Acyl&#8208;isocyanide Ylides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions are the preferred method to generate five&#8208;membered heterocyclic rings. Surprisingly, cycloadditions based on acyl&#8208;isocyanide ylides have remained underexplored by the chemical community. Acyl&#8208;isocyanide ylides readily react with dipolarophiles, such as substituted alkenes, to yield &#916;1&#8208;pyrroline derivatives. As an explanation for the observed reactivity of this reaction is lacking, extensive density functional theory calculations were performed to scrutinize the mechanistic features of the transformation. Herein we explain the experimental outcome of the reaction using a variety of reactivity theories and predict opposed regioselectivity for electron&#8208;poor and electron&#8208;rich dipolarophiles. With the insights obtained, we hope to incentivize the design of new cycloaddition reactions based on the acyl&#8208;isocyanide ylides motif.</dc:description>

         <title>CuMoO4 Catalyzed&#160; Csp 2&#8208;Se Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aryl Bromide and Iodide with Diaryldiselenides in Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein demonstrated, an oxo&#8208;bridged bimetallic CuMoO4 catalyst for Csp2&#8208;Se cross&#8208;coupling of diaryldiselenides with aryl&#8208;halides. The current discovery is noteworthy, as the catalyst is eco&#8208;friendly, easily accessible, air&#8208;stable, and recyclable. The methodology exhibits broad substrate scope and the catalytic system tolerates common functional groups. The protocol uses aryl iodide and bromides as electrophile instead of boronic acids. This is the first example of using an oxo&#8208; bridged copper based bimetallic catalyst for Csp2&#8208;Se cross&#8208;coupling reactions in water. C&#8208;Cl bond remains intact during reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;&#960; Interaction for Molecular Recognition of Anions : Focus on Cooperativity with Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion recognition represents an intense area of research in supramolecular chemistry. The last two decades have been marked by spectacular advances in the design of new anion receptors. Moreover, the development of approaches combining experimental and theoretical studies has proved to be particularly relevant, allowing a better understanding and rationalization of the phenomena involved in anion complexation processes. In this context, the combination of weak interactions within the same receptor and their synergistic effects, called cooperativity, has attracted increasing interest within the scientific community. This review focuses on the combination of anion&#8208;&#960; and hydrogen bonds and the emerging concept of cooperativity. The most relevant anion&#8208;&#960; donor families are presented. The concept of cooperativity is illustrated using the most recent examples present in current literature.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Dioxan&#8208;2&#8208;ones by Photo&#8208;Aerobic Selenium&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acid Multicatalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An expedient method for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from homoallylic carbonic acid esters by means of photo&#8208;aerobic selenium&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acid multicatalysis is reported. Until now, conceptually related methods commonly relied either on the stoichiometric addition of electrophiles onto the substrate&#8217;s alkene moiety or the presence of pre&#8208;installed leaving groups in allylic position of said alkene to &#8211; in part, catalytically &#173;&#8211; initiate an intramolecular attack by an adjacent carbonic acid ester group. In sharp contrast, the current study shows that the C&#8211;C double bond of homoallylic carbonic acid esters can be directly activated by the catalytic interplay of a pyrylium dye and a diselane using ambient air as the sole oxidant and visible light as an energy source.</dc:description>

In sharp contrast, the current study shows that the C&#8211;C double bond of homoallylic carbonic acid esters can be directly activated by the catalytic interplay of a pyrylium dye and a diselane using ambient air as the sole oxidant and visible light as an energy source.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Furylenevinylene oligomers as extended conjugated systems issue from renewable materials</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of furylenevinylene oligomers (FV) were synthesized of common furan platforms derived of lignocellulosic biomass. Their electronic properties were evaluated by UV&#8208;Vis absorption and cyclic voltammetry and compared with thienylenevinylene analogues (TV). The difference between the electronic properties of these extended vinyl&#8208;heterocycle derivatives is mainly due to the less aromaticity character of the furan cycle that allows an easier access to the quinoidic form and thus procure a better electronic delocalization. As a main consequence, the access to dication state is favoured for the furan derivatives with a quasi&#8208;coalescence of the two first oxidation potentials for 5 FV units.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Tweezer&#8208;type receptors that form p&#8208;p stacked supramolecular complexes are important components in functional polymers and molecular machines. Herein, we study how varying specific structural components of tweezer&#8208;receptors impacts their binding. A library of tweezer receptors, each containing two p&#8208;electron poor receptor residues and differing by the nature of the linking unit which was either a flexible 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylamine) residue or a rigid&#160;3,3&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;diamino&#8208;m&#8208;terphenyl diamine structure, were synthesised. Each tweezer formed 1:1 supramolecular complexes with p&#8208;electron rich residues (1,5&#8208;dihydroxynapthalene and pyrene) as confirmed by UV/Vis and&#160;1H NMR spectroscopic studies. Binding constants were determined to be between 2.3x10&#8208;5&#160;and 71 M&#8208;1&#160;in organic solvents and were one magnitude greater in aqueous solvents for water soluble systems. The nature of the linker had variable effects on the binding constants, showing the design of tweezer type supramolecular receptors with targeted&#160;Ka&#160;values is non&#8208;trivial and requires structural optimisation supported by binding constant determination studies.</dc:description>

The structure of Z&#8208;isomer of 3&#8208;methylene&#8208;isoindolinone 3x was confirmed by a single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The reaction mechanism studies by control experiments and using O18&#8208;labelled water revealed that the reaction was initiated by attack of a conjugate base of aryl/heteroaryl methyl ketones (2a&#8208;k) to aldehyde group of 1a&#8208;h followed by intramolecular oxidative cyclization involving nitrile functionality to furnish isoindolinone derivatives in good to excellent yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Homocoupling of 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;N&#8208;heterocycles and Application to the Synthesis of Phenylpyridine Borane Dimers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a regioselective cross&#8208;dehydrogenative homocoupling reaction using a heterogeneous Ru catalyst and iron trichloride as oxidant to gain access to various 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic dimers. Several homocoupling products obtained were then used to synthesize a series of pyridine&#8208;borane complexes and the impact of the dimerization on their photophysical properties was studied and rationalized by using theoretical calculations.







Abstract
A method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic dimers via a cross&#8208;dehydrogenative homocoupling (homo&#8208;CDC) has been developed using commercially available Ruthenium on charcoal as catalyst and iron trichloride as oxidant. A large variety of heterocyclic scaffolds and functional groups are tolerated and a complete regioselectivity resulting from the activation of the less sterically hindered C&#8722;H bonds was observed for meta&#8208;substituted substrates. Starting from several homocoupling products obtained, a series of pyridine&#8208;borane complexes was synthesized and the impact of the dimerization on their photophysical properties was studied and rationalized using theoretical calculations.

         <title>Boron Catalysis in the Transformation of Carboxylic Acids and Carboxylic Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carboxylic acids, amides, and esters are ubiquitous motifs in functional organic molecules. However, the reactivities of these high oxidation state carbonyl compounds are far lower than ketones and aldehydes, and catalysts applicable to transformations of this class of carbonyl compounds have been limited. On the other hand, boron catalysts have found various applications in the transformation of carbonyl compounds by taking advantage of the unique properties derived from their vacant p&#8208;orbitals. The continuous advancement of boron catalysis has realized several unprecedented direct transformations of carboxylic acids, amides, and esters in the past decade. In this review, representative achievements of boron catalysis are summarized according to reaction types by focusing on their applications to non&#8208;activated carboxylic acids, amides, and esters.</dc:description>

         <title>Vanadium Catalyst for C&#8211;&#160;and S&#8211;alkylation of Benzhydrols in Water: An Experimental Study and Green Metrics Evaluation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy for the vanadium&#8208;catalyzed dehydrative C&#8211; and S&#8211;alkylation by nucleophilic substitution of benzhydrols with arenes and thiols are reported. The alkylation was achieved with the divanadium oxoperoxo complex [K3(V+5)2(O22&#8722;)4(O2&#8722;)2(&#956;&#8208;OH)] in water under aerobic conditions. The newly developed transformation could accommodate a broad substrate scope including (hetero)arenes and thiols (34 examples). Both the symmetrical and unsymmetrical benzhydrols furnished excellent yields of the alkylated product under mild reaction conditions. The scope of this strategy was further extended to synthesize bis&#8208;benzylated arenes (polyarylated products) in high yields and regioselectivities. The green metrics determination of all the alkylated products suggests the technical and environmental benefits of the present protocol. The longevity experiment reveals the catalytic activity was maintained over seven cycles. To understand the mechanism of the present reaction, detailed spectroscopic and kinetic studies were undertaken. This simple protocol, which affords the desired products with water as the by&#8208;product, can be achieved under mild conditions without the need for a base or other additives.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide Conjugated Dihydroazulene/Vinylheptafulvene Photoswitches in Aqueous Environment</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of dihydroazulene/vinylheptafulvene (DHA/VHF) photoswitches was prepared and studied in various media regarding their photophysical, photochemical, and thermal properties. To pave the way towards the use of DHAs as building blocks in bio(macro)molecules, we synthesized peptide conjugates including the 17&#8208;amino acid ALFA peptide and found excellent switching properties of the biohybrid constructs in aqueous media.&#8201;







Abstract
Light&#8208;responsive molecules have seen a major advance in modulating biological functions in recent years. Especially photoswitches are highly attractive building blocks due to the reversible nature of their light&#8208;mediated reactivity. They are frequently used to affect both the properties of small bioactive compounds and biomacromolecules if incorporated suitably. Despite their success in a plethora of applications, only a limited set of photochromic core structures is routinely employed and a large number of photochromic couples are under&#8208;investigated in biological context. Broadening the toolbox of photoswitches available to modulate biological activity would open new avenues and unlock the full potential of photoswitchable molecules for biological studies. In this work, we explore the photochemical and thermal properties of the dihydroazulene/vinylheptafulvene photochromic couple as peptide conjugates in aqueous environment.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Arylnaphthalene Lignans through a Photochemical Key Step</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total syntheses of arylnaphthalene lignans (ANL) Vitrofolal E (1), Noralashinol C (2), and Ternifoliuslignan E (3) are described. These natural products have in common a missing substituent in 2&#8208;position of the naphthalene skeleton (2H&#8208;ANL). The key step of the syntheses is the Photo&#8208;Dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (PDDA) reaction between arylalkyne moieties, which are connected by a suberate linker unit. The reasons for the regioselectivity of the photochemical ring closure were investigated by means of DFT methods.







Abstract
The total syntheses of three arylnaphthalene lignans (ANLs) were developed: Vitrofolal E (1), Noralashinol C (2), and Ternifoliuslignan E (3). These natural products have in common a missing substituent in 2&#8208;position of the naphthalene moiety (2H&#8208;ANLs). The key step of these syntheses is a regioselective intramolecular Photo&#8208;Dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (PDDA) reaction with (1,7)naphthalenophanes as primary products. A further improvement of the photochemical step was achieved by triplet sensitization with xanthone, allowing the use of more efficient UVA lamps. It should be noted that this work is a continuation of a previous publication about the total synthesis of lignans using the PDDA reaction.[1]

         <title>Tuning the Electro&#8208;Optical Properties of Mixed&#8208;Halide Trityl Radicals Bearing para&#8208;Brominated Positions through Halogen Substitution</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new mixed&#8208;halide trityl radicals bearing p&#8208;brominated positions were synthesized in good yield from halogenated triphenylmethanes obtained by multistep Friedel&#8208;Crafts reactions. Their electrochemical and spectroscopic properties were reported as well as quantum&#8208;chemical calculations carried out to supplement the experimental investigation. The most blue&#8208;shifted emission among trityl radicals was achieved for the highly fluorinated trityl radical.







Abstract
In this work, the synthesis and characterization of two new trityl radicals bearing two p&#8208;brominated positions, i.&#8201;e. the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;((perchlorophenyl)methylene)bis(1,3,5&#8208;tribromobenzene) radical and the 6,6&#8242;&#8208;((perchlorophenyl)methylene)bis(3&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene) radical, are presented. Slightly modifying the strategy typically used for the synthesis of non&#8208;symmetric mixed&#8208;halide trityl radicals, we were able to considerably increase the reaction yield for the radical precursors. In addition, for the first time the electro&#8208;optical properties of a highly fluorinated trityl radical were studied, achieving the most blue&#8208;shifted emission for a trityl radical reported up to now. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations carried out to supplement the experimental investigation support the electrochemical and spectroscopic data as well as rationalize the observed blue shift of the highly fluorinated species.

         <title>Perfluorinated Sulfonate Resins as Reusable Heterogeneous Catalysts for the One&#8208;pot Synthesis of DiPhenolic Esters (DPEs)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Levulinic acid, easily obtained from cellulose, represents a fundamental chemical platform for a number of valuable building blocks. Among them, diphenolic acid and its esters (DPA and DPE) are valid candidates to replace Bisphenol A in polycarbonate and epoxy resin production processes. In this study, we report a one&#8208;pot synthesis of alkyl DPEs in the presence of a heterogenous acid catalyst starting from levulinic acid, an alcohol and phenol as solvent&#8208;reagent. The most interesting member of the DPE family, the ethyl 4,4&#8208;bis(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)pentanoate, is selectively obtained in a good yield in the presence of a commercially available heterogeneous acid catalyst, the Aquivion, which can be reused for at least six times without any noticeable loss in activity.</dc:description>

         <title>1,8&#8208;Diarylnaphthalenes: Synthesis, Properties, and Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. 1,8&#8208;Diarylnaphthalenes are a fascinating example of strained organic molecules that have found many practical applications due to unusual parallel face&#8208;to&#8208;face arrangement of two peri&#8208;aryl rings in close proximity almost perpendicular to the central naphthalene backbone. 1,8&#8208;Diarylnaphthalenes show notable potential as photoluminescent and chiral sensors, stereodynamic switches, nonlinear optic chromophores, blue&#8208;transparent frequency doublers, materials for creating high&#8208;performance blue and green OLEDs, chiral ligands and so on. Molecules of this type have also been used as convenient models for studying &#960;&#8211;&#960;, dipole&#8208;&#960; and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions. 1,8&#8208;Diarylnaphthalenes are also interesting as objects to study atropisomeric transformations: if the peri&#8208;aryl rings have ortho&#8208; or meta&#8208;substituents, then the anti&#8208;conformer becomes C2&#8208;symmetrical (hence chiral), and the syn&#8208;isomer upon symmetrical substitution is achiral. Despite the extensive knowledge accumulated and the usefulness of these compounds that have become apparent, there are still no reviews on 1,8&#8208;diarylnaphthalenes. In this review, data on synthetic methods, applications, atropisomerism and structural characteristics of 1,8diaryl&#8208; and 1,8&#8208;dihetarylnaphthalenes are summarized.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Alkoxy enones are quite useful building blocks in organic chemistry. The existing methods for syntheses of these compounds remain somewhat limited. Over the past years, nucleophilic phosphine catalysis has emerged as a practical and powerful tool for constructing diverse molecules with the advantages of environmental&#8208;friendly, metal&#8208;free, and mild reaction conditions. Meanwhile, alkynone is easy to prepare, can undergo a variety of reactions, and is a commonly used substrate for organic synthesis. &#945;&#8208;Addition of alcohols to alkynones is a direct way to construct &#945;&#8208;alkoxy enones. In this study, it was delighted to find that the employment of PPh3 (10 mmol%) and 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) (20 mmol%) could redirect from the &#946;&#8208;addition mode to &#945;&#8208;addition. With this approach, a variety of &#945;&#8208;alkoxy enones could be obtained directly with good yields and regioselectivity. Under optimal conditions, the generality of the reaction was investigated. Substrate scope studies showed that the reaction was well tolerated with many alcohols. Mechanistic study is also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe new synthetic approaches to fused 5/5/6&#8208;carbocyclic frameworks present in various polycyclic natural products such as presilphiperfolanols, lycopodium alkaloids and cyclopiane diterpenes. Our work features, a strategically introduced hydroxy group at the tert&#8208;carbon center of the tricyclic system which is present in presilphiperfolanols. In addition, one presilphiperfolanol analogue is reported to show the potential of strategies disclosed in this work. All the new compounds are characterized by high&#8208;resolution NMR spectral data. The structures of critical compounds were confirmed by various chemical transformations and further supported by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data. Overall, our approach is simple and rely on readily available starting materials, and involves a tandem&#8208;metathesis sequence. The synthetic studies disclosed here are applicable to the synthesis of natural products and to design medicinally important targets.</dc:description>

         <title>Deoxygenative Intramolecular Minisci&#8208;Type Reaction to Access Fused Heterocyclic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid build of molecular complexity is a key for the development of novel bioactive molecules. Herein we present a three&#8208;step synthetic sequence to access fused heterocyclic scaffolds from readily available starting materials, such as halogenated heteroarenes and 1,3&#8208;diols. The key step of the strategy is the development of a deoxygenative intramolecular Minisci&#8208;type reaction.







Abstract
Herein, we present a straightforward strategy for the synthesis of fused heterocycles through a deoxygenative, intramolecular Minisci&#8208;type reaction. This approach grants access to complex polycyclic scaffolds in three steps from readily available starting materials, such as chlorinated heteroarenes and 1,3&#8208;diols. The use of saccharide derivatives as the starting 1,3&#8208;diol motif allows for the synthesis of novel heterocyclic scaffolds with excellent diastereoselectivity and formal retention of configuration at the newly formed C&#8722;C bond.

         <title>In Situ Generated DBU&#8901;HF Acts as a Fluorinating Agent in a Hexafluoroisobutylation Tandem Reaction: An Effective Route to 5,5,5,5&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;Hexafluoroleucine</title>

A stereoselective synthesis of both (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;5,5,5,5&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;hexafluoroleucine mediated by DBU through a cascade reaction is reported. The pivotal role of the organic base to preserve the nucleophilicity of the fluoride released during the process is shown. The direct incorporation of the hexafluorinated side chain allows for the facile preparation of the free and suitably protected fluorinated amino acids on a multidecagram scale.







Abstract
We report the direct incorporation of the hexafluoroisobutyl group on a chiral glycine Schiff base complex mediated by 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene (DBU). The fluoroalkylation involves 2&#8208;(bromomethyl)&#8208;1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoropropane reagent, which generates in&#8197;situ hexafluoroisobutylene (HFIB), and reacts then with the enolate through a tandem allylic shift/hydrofluorination process. We showed that the use of neutral organic base DBU generates in&#8197;situ an original DBU&#8901;HF salt, which preserves the fluoride nucleophilicity and acts as a fluorinating agent. This fluoride salt promotes the hydrofluorination of the pentafluorinated alkene overcoming the usual fluoride &#946;&#8208;elimination observed with &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;vinyl reagents. With alkali metal bases, by contrast, the hydrofluorination is disfavored and the pentafluorinated alkene intermediate is obtained predominantly. This study highlights the critical role of the fluoride counter ion to preserve its nucleophilicity. The protocol is amenable to multidecagram scale synthesis of enantiopure (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;5,5,5,5&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;hexafluoroleucine and their N&#8208;Fmoc or N&#8208;Boc derivatives in good overall yield.

         <title>Synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Physovenine via Electrochemical C&#8211;O Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigated an electrochemical C&#8211;O bond formation approach to (&#177;)&#8208;physovenine. The reaction conditions are mild compared to canonical routes, which typically utilize strong hydride reagents such as lithium aluminum hydride. This enabled extension of the electrochemical cyclization to a substrate bearing the fully functionalized phenyl ring of the natural product. The electrochemical cyclization is diasetereoselective and starting from enantiopure substrate would provide a single enantiomer of physovenine. In the course of an initial formal synthesis, we identified conditions to afford modest enantioselective substrate synthesis that demonstrate the feasibility of an enantioselective synthesis. Among the substrates investigated, acetyl&#8208;, tosyl&#8208; or Boc&#8208;nitrogen substitution led to an alternative electrochemical C&#8211;O bond formation pathway where the hydroxyl nucleophile cyclized onto the aromatic ring vs. the 2&#8208;position of the indoline. This work expands the utility of electrochemical C&#8211;O bond formation and provides a foundation for further applications to functionalized cyclic ether construction.</dc:description>

Assistance of the sterically hindered pentylidene acetal worked well under electrochemical conditions, and redox&#8208;induced N&#8208;&#945; hydroxylation and continuous C&#8208;glycosidation gave desired C&#8208;azanucleosides with high &#946;&#8208;selectivity (&gt;98&#8201;%).







Abstract
Herein, we report a practical method for de novo preparation of imino&#8208;d&#8208;ribitol and C&#8208;azanucleosides. The diastereopure Imino&#8208;d&#8208;ribitol was synthesized on a multigram scale by simple manipulation, and late&#8208;stage anomeric derivatization by regio&#8208; and diastereoselective electrochemical C(sp3)&#8722;H activation enabled the efficient synthesis of the corresponding C&#8208;azanucleosides with high &#946;&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Synthesis of Naphthyridine and Azepine Backbones through Formal [4+3] and [4+2] Annulation via Cascade Ring&#8208;Opening/Cyclization Reaction of 2H&#8208;Azirines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A zinc&#8208;mediated cascade ring&#8208;opening cyclization of 2  H  &#8208;azirines and enolized&#8208;  O  &#8208;alkenylquinoline carbaldehydes for the synthesis of naphthyridine and azepine skeletons have been disclosed. Regioselectivity of the reaction can be switched from seven&#8208; to six&#8208;membered ring by shifting from two&#8208; to monosubstituted 2  H  &#8208;azirine. This transformation involves the construction of two C=C and C=N double bonds.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;catalysed C&#8208;H Borylation of Fluoroarenes: Insights into the Balance between Steric and Electronic Control of Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The iridium catalysed C&#8208;H borylation of per&#8208; and polyfluorinated arenes and heteroarenes occurs rapidly and efficiently. As with other borylation reactions, whilst steric parameters dominate, an underlying electronic influence on reaction selectivity can be observed. Notably borylation regioselectivity in fluorinated (hetero)arenes is determined by purely electronic effects except for  ortho  &#8208;borylation between two fluorine atoms where steric effects of fluorine substituents become apparent. Borylation at the  para  position with respect to fluorine is disfavoured whereas a strong electronic preference for borylation  para  to the azinyl nitrogen of pyridine is observed. When these features co&#8208;operate high selectivity can be expected. For these reactions, computations based on transition state, rather than intermediate, energies in iridium geometries showed excellent agreement between predicted and observed selectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Assessment of the Electrochemical Synthesis Route to Silicones Starting from Silica as Feedstock</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The demand for alternatives to the industrial highly energy intensive process for the conversion of silica as feedstock to silicones led us to critically evaluate the previously described direct electrochemical pathway. We successfully achieved methylation of various SiO2 sources to cyclic methylsiloxanes via electroreduction reaction. Contrary to previous assumptions, the reaction does not start from methanol as methyl radical source, that results in methoxylation of the electrolyte solvent. Methylammonium cations were found to enable the direct conversion, strongly dependent on the radical intermediate stabilization by the electrolyte. THF / Bu4NCF3SO3 is the sole applicable system with current yields below 6% obtained so far. Mechanistic insights show that methylation does not occur via the supposed hydrolysis of dimethoxydimethylsilane intermediate, but via a direct depolymerization reaction, as comparative studies of a Fenton&#8208;type procedure clearly indicate. Further, cyclic methylsiloxane products are prone to subsequent electrochemical equilibration, strongly directed by the electrolyte solvent.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>As the models for studying defected graphene, &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems containing heptagonal rings have attracted increasing interest due to their dynamic behaviors, electronic properties, aromaticity, and solid&#8208;state packing.

This review summarizes research on the different synthetic routes to access boron&#8208;doped heptagons including borepins, azaborepins, and oxaborepins, with the emphasis on the structure&#8208;property relationships at the molecular level.</dc:description>

         <title>Ethynyl&#8208;Bridged Bis&#8208;Quinolinium Dyes. Studies Toward the Dependence of Different Types of Conjugation on Spectroscopic Properties.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dicationic bisquinolinium salts possessing different types of conjugation are presented in which the hetareniums are separated by acetylenic or 1,4&#8208;diethynylbenzene spacers. Cross&#8208;conjugation is induced by interconnections via the 3&#8208;positions of the heteroareniums, and conjugation is realized by 2,2/2,4/4,4&#8208;interconnections. We also synthesized mixed cross&#8208;conjugated/conjugated 2,3/4,3&#8208;interconnected species. The different types of conjugation determine the charge distribution according to the rules of resonance which translate into characteristic 13C NMR as well as UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;spectroscopic properties, LUMO geometries, and chemical properties. We found that the triple bond&#180;s resonance frequencies are sensitive 13C NMR spectroscopic indicators for the type of conjugation. Combining cross&#8208;conjugated and conjugated structure elements of dicationic bis&#8208;quinolinium dyes via triple bonds without additional benzene spacer results in considerable bathochromic shifts of the UV&#8208;Vis absorption maxima [&#916;&#955;max &#8776; 100 nm]. A charge transfer was calculated from the HOMO of the conjugated into the LUMO of the cross&#8208;conjugated partial structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlation between Absorption and Substitution of Photochromic 1,2&#8208;Bis(thienyl)ethenes (BTEs) Using Modified Spectroscopic Hammett Equations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Hammett&#8208;Brown substituent constants of &#945;'&#8208;substituted BTEs (open and closed) correlate linearly with the excitation energies of the absorption maxima applying the spectroscopic Hammett equation.







Abstract
Series of photochromic 1,2&#8208;bis(thienyl)ethenes possessing perfluorocyclopentene backbones, either hydrogen or methyl groups at the &#946;&#8208;positions of the thiophenes, and a variety of substituents in their &#945;'&#8208;positions were prepared, which cover the range from electron&#8208;donating to electron&#8208;withdrawing (Me, &#8722;CH2OH, &#8722;OTBS, &#8722;TMS, &#8722;Br, 1,3&#8208;dioxan&#8208;2&#8208;yl, pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl, &#8722;CH2OH, &#8722;COOH). As a linear free energy relationship the spectroscopic Hammett equation gives fair to excellent fits to the excitation energy of the absorption maxima of the ring&#8208;opened as well as the ring&#8208;closed forms of the BTEs, when Hammett substituent constants &#963;p were replaced by Brown's modified substituent constants &#963;p+ and &#963;p&#8722;. Vice versa, hitherto unknown Hammett&#8208;Brown substituent constants can be estimated from the UV spectra. Furthermore, we compared the experimentally measured absorption maxima with values which we calculated by three different methods (DFT STEOM&#8208;DLPNO&#8208;CCSD/def2&#8208;TZVPP, TD&#8208;DFT &#969;B97X&#8208;D3/6&#8208;31G*, TD&#8208;DFT &#969;B97X&#8208;D3/6&#8208;311++G**).

A photoredox/copper&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;enynes with readily available trifluoromethylaminating reagent and TMSCN was developed. This reaction proceeded at mild conditions, affording the corresponding trifluoromethylaminated allenes in good yields and excellent regioselectivity. The synthetic application of the resulting products has also been demonstrated by the transformation to N&#8722;CF3 oxazolidinones.

Aza&#8208;oxyallyl cations have garnered significant attention among the synthetic organic community as a versatile synthon for the construction of N&#8208;heterocycles. This review article provides an update of the recent developments in this area and the prevailing mechanistic insight.







Abstract
Aza&#8208;oxyallyl cations, as proposed by Sheehan in the 1960s have garnered significant attention among the synthetic organic community, owing to their diverse reactivity profile for constructing N&#8208;scaffolds of biological interest. During its initial growth, aza&#8208;oxyallyl cations were used effectively as a 3&#8208;unit synthon as 1,3 dipoles to create N&#8208;heterocycles via cycloaddition reactions, wherein aza&#8208;oxyallyl cation served as electrophilic counterpart. Recently, new variations of aza&#8208;oxyallyl cations reactivity have been reported, including its usage as a 1,4 dipole in cycloaddition reactions, domino reactions, and the unique alkylating ability of heteroatoms. This review article provides an update of the recent developments in this area and the prevailing mechanistic insight.

         <title>Electrochemical Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Azidoesterification of Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient electrochemical metal&#8208;catalyzed protocol has been developed for the azidoesterification of alkenes, providing a practical method for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acid derivatives.







Abstract
We report an efficient and sustainable electrocatalytic approach for azidoesterification of alkenes. The reaction proceeds by electrochemical iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of commercially available carbazates to produce alkoxycarbonyl radicals. Upon addition across alkenes, the generated transient carbon&#8208;centered radicals get trapped by azido metal complexes to furnish the alkene difunctionalization products. This mild, operationally simple protocol transforms a wide variety of alkenes into the corresponding &#946;&#8208;azido esters in good to excellent yields, thereby providing a practical access to &#946;&#8208;amino acid derivatives from simple and readily available starting materials.

Combining a facile light&#8208;mediated enolization of o&#8208;methyl benzophenones/Diels&#8208;Alder reaction domino process with a subsequent deprotection/aromatization domino reaction leads to waste&#8208;reducing and cost&#8208;effective synthesis of new antiviral model drugs.







Abstract
We report the development of a metal&#8208;free four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy to access high&#8208;value functionalized phthalazines using o&#8208;methyl benzophenones as starting compounds. Combining a light&#8208;mediated enolization of o&#8208;methyl benzophenones/Diels&#8208;Alder reaction domino process with a subsequent deprotection/aromatization domino reaction in one&#8208;pot leads to sustainable and efficient organic synthesis. The tangible advantages, i.&#8201;e., absence of catalysts or additives, utilization of commercially available and/or easily accessible substrates, mild reaction conditions, simplicity, and single work&#8208;up procedure, make this combined process highly appealing for the direct construction of various 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;phthalazines. Importantly, in&#8197;vitro bioactivity evaluation of these newly prepared heterocyclic compounds demonstrated a strong antiviral efficacy against major human pathogens like HCMV and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical method for the oxidative rearrangement of indoles to spirooxindoles in employing an undivided, single pass flow cell is reported. The electrochemical reactions require no chemical oxidants and can be scaled up easily without need for re&#8208;optimization of reaction conditions by continuous production with parallel reactors.







Abstract
The oxidative rearrangement of indoles induced by various chemical oxidants is a frequently employed method for the construction of spirooxindole structures. Herein, we report an electrochemical method for the oxidative rearrangement of indoles to spirooxindoles in continuous flow. The electrochemical reactions require no chemical oxidants and can be scaled up easily without need for re&#8208;optimization of reaction conditions by passing more starting material through parallel reactors.

         <dc:description>Glycogen synthase kinase&#8208;3 &#945;/&#946; is involved in dysregulation of neuronal tau protein in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD).

         <title>Asymmetric Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C Bond Formation Using Alkenes as Substrates: Insight into Recent Enantioselective Developments</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective mono&#8208; and difunctionalization of alkenes, involving C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C bond formation, are discussed, highlighting the fundamental role of ligands and reaction conditions optimization. This review summarizes the significant advances made over the last years and provides tools for developing new enantioselective transformations.







Abstract
This Review summarizes the advances in the catalytic enantioselective mono&#8208; and difunctionalization of alkenes, highlighting the fundamental role of ligands. Several types of asymmetric reactions have been developed involving different bonds formation, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C, highlighting the urgency to go ahead in the search for new ligands and synthetic methodologies in order to improve the control over the reaction selectivity and activity and thus, to increase the applications in the synthesis of heterocyclic scaffolds and biologically active compounds. The Review is organized into paragraphs, which discuss the type of bond formed during the nucleopalladation, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C bonds, and the type of reaction involved.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast Continuous&#8208;Flow Photo&#8208;Thiol&#8208;Ene Functionalization of Conformation&#8208;Controlled Cinchona Alkaloids</title>

         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;fast continuous&#8208;flow photo&#8208;thiol&#8208;ene reactions on cinchona alkaloids are possible through a fine control of the reactive conformation in solution. Switching the hydroxyl group at C9 by a phenyl carbamate allows thiol&#8208;ene functionalization of cinchona alkaloids in less than 2.5&#8197;minutes with organic thiols at 32&#8201;&#176;C ant under light irradiation at 365&#8197;nm.







Abstract
In this work, we describe ultra&#8208;fast continuous flow photo&#8208;thiol&#8208;ene reactions on cinchona alkaloids derivatives through a control of the reactive conformation in solution. Flow thiol&#8208;ene reactions proceed at 32&#8201;&#176;C under light irradiation at 365&#8197;nm and require only 2.5&#8197;minutes of residence time to reach completion. The short path length of the tubular flow photochemical reactor, which maximizes and homogenizes the photon flux, associated to the fine tuning of the reactive conformation of cinchona alkaloids in solution are the main reasons for the high rates observed. The predominant conformation in solution of cinchona alkaloids was adjusted through the substitution of the hydroxyl group at C9 by a phenyl carbamate function.

         <title>Highly Selective Catalyst&#8208;Free Oxidative Synthesis of N&#8208;Formamides from C2&#8208; and C3&#8208;Feedstocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different C2&#8208; and C3&#8208;feedstocks are explored, out of these, 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone (DHA) and glyoxal (GLYOX) as carbon sources provide quantitative yields of N&#8208;formamides at optimal conditions using TBHP as oxidant with minimal carbon loss by applying a carbon source:amine ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;2. This methodology also works well on 5 gram substrate scale producing yields of N&#8208;formanilide product up to 87&#8201;%.







Abstract
The application of bio&#8208;derived feedstocks as building blocks in organic syntheses holds great value with goals of high product yield and minimizing carbon loss. As contribution to this effort, present work explores 5 different C2&#8208; and C3&#8208;feedstocks (derived from biomass and conventional sources) such as glycerol (GLY), 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone (DHA), ethylene glycol (EG), glycolic acid (GLYAC) and glyoxal (GLYOX) as carbon sources for highly selective, catalyst&#8208;free oxidative synthesis of N&#8208;formamides from primary and secondary amines. Both DHA and GLYOX showed the best carbon efficiency through carbon source: amine ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;2, resulting in 100&#8201;% selectivity of N&#8208;formanilide with tert&#8208;butyl hydrogen peroxide (TBHP) as the oxidant. GLYOX was applied further for synthesizing a N&#8208;formamide library of 21 substrates exemplifying substantial yields ranging from 68&#8211;98&#8201;%. Moreover, pilot scalability of this methodology achieved a yield of 87&#8201;% and 72&#8201;% for aniline substrate at 5&#8208;gram scale using GLYOX and DHA respectively in 24&#8197;hours.

The most recent and successful reports of sugar&#8208;based bactericides, bacteriostatic agents, and adhesin binders are covered with focus on the methodologies employed in their synthesis, resulting in a useful compilation of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reactions used in carbohydrate modification.







Abstract
With the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), innovation in antibacterial drug research and development is urgently needed and strongly encouraged by the World Health Organization (WHO). Carbohydrates are valuable bioactive scaffolds to be explored in this context, and because of their unique multifunctionality, stereochemical diversity, and natural protein&#8208;binding profile, they come across as attractive starting materials for the synthesis of antimicrobial agents with innovative mechanisms of action (MoA). In this concise review, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methodologies for the synthesis of an array of promising and recently developed carbohydrate&#8208;based molecules with antibacterial activity are presented and discussed. By describing successful case studies as platforms for the scrutiny of carbohydrate modification and coupling approaches in organic chemistry, this work summarizes the latest research efforts in this area, ultimately encouraging the design and synthesis of new and much&#8208;needed glycoantibiotic leads for pharmaceutical development.

         <title>Novel Approaches To Design Glycan&#8208;Based Antibacterial Inhibitors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sweet and sticky: This review describes recent advances in the synthesis and application of homo&#8208;and heterovalent glycan&#8208;scaffolds as potential candidates for efficient bacteria lectin inhibition. To study and address the many complex molecular mechanisms involved in multivalent lectin binding events, novel glycoconjugate designs and fine&#8208;tunable glycomaterials have been developed.







Abstract
The interactions between bacterial lectins and carbohydrates on the host cell surface can mediate bacterial adhesion, invasion, and immune evasion. Multivalency plays a key role in these binding events. However, additional molecular mechanisms greatly impact multivalent binding recognition. To develop specific and effective bacterial inhibitors, a deeper understanding of the complex underlying mechanisms of bacterial adhesion processes is necessary. By interfering with bacterial adhesion, synthetic multivalent glycoconjugates do not only have the potential to improve or replace antibiotic treatments, but also represent useful tools to study carbohydrate&#8208;pathogen interactions. In this review, we highlight a few recent advances in the synthesis and application of synthetic glycan&#8208;based scaffolds to uncover the nature of glycan&#8208;bacteria interactions and to design efficient bacterial inhibitors.

         <title>Recent Developments and Trends in Asymmetric Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric organocatalysis has developed spectacularly over the last decades, and its general importance was recently highlighted by the 2021 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. This Perspective aims at providing a brief historical introduction to this field, as well as discussing selected advanced recent examples underscoring the diversity and potential of this still growing and vibrant field.







Abstract
Asymmetric organocatalysis has experienced a long and spectacular way since the early reports over a century ago by von Liebig, Knoevenagel and Bredig, showing that small (chiral) organic molecules can catalyze (asymmetric) reactions. This was followed by impressive first highly enantioselective reports in the second half of the last century, until the hype initiated in 2000 by the milestone publications of MacMillan and List, which finally culminated in the 2021 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. This short Perspective aims at providing a brief introduction to the field by first looking on the historical development and the more classical methods and concepts, followed by discussing selected advanced recent examples that opened new directions and diversity within this still growing field.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Free Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Mizoroki&#8208;Heck Reaction Strategy for the One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Functionalized Oxygen Heterocycles in Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligandless, telescoped, one&#8208;pot reductive Mizoroki&#8208;Heck reactions proceed smoothly and regioselectively in eco&#8208;friendly eutectic mixtures, and under aerobic conditions to yield 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl THF or THP derivatives in up to 95&#8201;% yield. Key intermediates have also been targeted in DES en route to pharmacologically relevant molecules.







Abstract
A Deep Eutectic Solvent, choline chloride/glycerol (1&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;mol&#8201;mol&#8722;1), proved to be an effective and sustainable reaction medium to promote telescoped, one&#8208;pot Mizoroki&#8208;Heck cross&#8208;coupling/reduction processes between 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran or 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran and several (hetero)aryl halides to easily access valuable 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl tetrahydrofuran (THF) or tetrahydropyran derivatives in up to 95&#8201;% yield. Notably, the whole transformation takes place under aerobic conditions, in the absence of additional ligands, and with a good substrate scope. The practicability of the method is also exemplified by the sustainable synthesis of two key THF derivatives, which are side chains of pharmacologically relevant inhibitors of Kv1.2 channel.

         <title>Stereoconvergent Synthesis of Cyclopentenyl Nucleosides by Palladium&#8208;Assisted Allylic Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stoichiometric Tsuji&#8208;Trost reaction of cyclopentenyl carbonates proceeds in stereoconvergent manner, selectively leading to cis configured nucleosides, regardless the relative configuration (cis or trans) of the starting substrates. As indicated by DFT calculations, the reaction outcome relies on the low activation energy related to the crucial, Pd&#8208;dependent &#960;&#8208;inversion step. This approach may represent a useful strategy for the synthesis of bioactive carbocyclic nucleosides.







Abstract
The Tsuji&#8208;Trost reaction of cyclopentenyl carbonates was explored by experimental studies and computational calculations, in search for the synthetic conditions enabling the stereoconvergent synthesis of cyclopentenyl nucleosides. Under common conditions, cyclopentenyl reagents provide Tsuji&#8208;Trost products only in a weakly stereoconvergent manner. However, changes in the amount of catalyst (up to 1 eq) affect either the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the reaction, selectively leading to cis configured cyclopentenyl N9&#8208;linked purine nucleosides, regardless the relative configuration (cis or trans) of the starting substrates. DFT studies clarified that this could be due to the low activation energy related to the crucial, Pd&#8208;dependent &#960;&#8208;inversion step.

         <title>Selective Electrochemical Dibromination of Terpenes and Naturally Derived Olefins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective electrochemical dibromination method of terpenes and naturally derived olefins to functional intermediates has been established using bench&#8208;stable, inexpensive sodium bromide as bromine source at carbon&#8208;based electrodes.







Abstract
A simple electrochemical protocol is established for the selective alkene dibromination of naturally derived olefins, such as terpenes. The use of hazardous Br2 or its analogues have been elegantly avoided by employing readily available, inexpensive, and harmless sodium bromide with a dual role as reagent and supporting electrolyte in combination with sustainable carbon&#8208;based electrodes. This electrochemical protocol provides the desired products with good to excellent yields up to 82&#8201;% with 10 examples. Scalability has been proved by a 5&#8208;fold scale&#8208;up. Notably, higher yields and selectivity were achieved in comparison to conventional bromination by Br2 and DMSO/HBr system and the dibrominated compound was eligible for further functionalization, such as cyanation according to the Kolbe nitrile synthesis protocol.
