         <dc:description>N&#8208;type organic semiconductors based on non&#8208;fused rings offer concise synthesis routes and low&#8211;cost production. Leveraging intramolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions, non&#8208;fused organic semiconductors can achieve fine regulation of molecular spatial configurations, thereby influencing the electrical performance. Herein, we successfully developed a non&#8208;fused n&#8208;type organic semiconductor with an A&#8208;D&#8208;A'&#8208;D&#8208;A structure, designated as IMIC. Compared to the fused A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A molecule, IMIC not only simplifies the synthetic steps but also significantly improves solubility and optical absorption properties. The non&#8208;fused molecular architecture relieves the internal stress of rigid, curved polycyclic fused rings, granting greater spatial freedom to the components of the IMIC molecule, which is conducive to optimizing the spatial configuration of the molecule in the aggregated state. Ultimately, the electron mobility of OFET devices based on IMIC is tripled compared to TIIC, reaching 1.1&#215;10&#8208;3 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 in ambient conditions.</dc:description>

Leveraging intramolecular non-covalent interactions, non-fused organic semiconductors can achieve fine regulation of molecular spatial configurations, thereby influencing the electrical performance. Herein, we successfully developed a non-fused n-type organic semiconductor with an A-D-A'-D-A structure, designated as IMIC. Compared to the fused A-DA'D-A molecule, IMIC not only simplifies the synthetic steps but also significantly improves solubility and optical absorption properties. The non-fused molecular architecture relieves the internal stress of rigid, curved polycyclic fused rings, granting greater spatial freedom to the components of the IMIC molecule, which is conducive to optimizing the spatial configuration of the molecule in the aggregated state.

         <title>Directing&#8208;Group&#8208;Assisted Markovnikov Hydroximation of Styrenes Enabled by Photoredox/Cobalt Dual&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By the combination of acridinium salt as a photocatalyst and cobaloxime complex as a co&#8208;catalyst, a simple and mild approach has been developed for the directing&#8208;group&#8208;assisted Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydroximation of styrenes under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Herein, the directing&#8208;group on styrenes plays an important role for this transformation. Although the substrate scope seems to be limited, such an approach features excellent regioselectivity and high atom economy. In contrast with previous methodologies, this photoredox /cobalt dual&#8208;catalytic system is operationally simple, and avoids the use of any other sacrificial reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Heterocycles Through Enantioselective Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Transformations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The power of chiral silver catalysts as special mild Lewis acids has been applied to develop enantioselective 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions, complex domino/tandem reactions, and miscellaneous cyclizations, allowing novel chiral heterocyclic products to be achieved in high enantioselectivities. This review updates the field of enantioselective silver&#8208;catalyzed transformations applied to the synthesis of chiral heterocycles, covering the literature since 2018.







Abstract
This review collects the recent developments in the synthesis of chiral heterocycles through enantioselective silver&#8208;catalyzed transformations published since 2018. It demonstrates the power of chiral silver catalysts as special mild Lewis acids to provide an impressive diversity of reaction pathways, such as 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions, various types of cyclizations, along with a wide variety of more complex domino/tandem reactions, allowing many types of novel chiral heterocyclic products to be achieved in high enantioselectivities.

         <dc:description>
A stereoselective Ni&#8722;Al bimetal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkenylation of quinazolinones with alkynes has been successfully developed. The reaction has good E/Z selectivity and exhibits a trans&#8208;configuration opposite to conventional alkynylation reactions, thus improving the diversity of quinazolinone compounds.







Abstract
A stereoselective Ni&#8722;Al bimetal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkenylation of quinazolinones with alkynes has been successfully developed. Good selectivity of Z&#8208;type quinazolinone products was obtained using readily available substrates, which exhibits a trans&#8208;configuration opposite to the conventional alkynylation reactions and improves the diversity of quinazolinone compounds. In addition, the reaction process was further explored through KIE and other control experiments, and a possible mechanism was proposed.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of novel aminoindolizidines fused to (tetrahydro)furan, thiophene or pyrrole nuclei were synthesized using a concise and diastereoselective approach from optically pure tricyclic heteroaryl&#8208;indolizidinols as key substrates. The synthesis involved Jurjew&#8208;type skeletal rearrangement, Staudinger reduction, Thompson azidation and Ra&#8722;Ni mediated diastereoselective catalytic hydrogenation. Overall, aminoindolizidines were synthesized in 6&#8211;8 steps from L&#8208;glutamic acid and heteroaryl carbaldehyde.







Abstract
A series of novel optically pure aminoindolizidines featuring fused tetrahydro&#8208;furan, thiophene, or pyrrole ring were synthesized from the proteinogenic L&#8208;glutamic acid as a chiral precursor and a nitrogen atom source. The synthetic sequence employed tricyclic indolizidinols as advanced building blocks, which were prepared on a gram&#8208;scale from bioavailable reagents. Key transformations within the used synthetic sequence included diastereoselective Thompson azidation, Staudinger reduction, Jurjew reaction, and highly diastereoselective catalytic hydrogenation. These steps facilitated the efficient and stereoselective synthesis of the ultimate amino&#8208; and N&#8208;acetylamino&#8208;indolizidines.

         <title>Elucidating Fluorine Steering Effects in Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions Interfaced with Charge&#8208;Enhanced Reactivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;depth computational and experimental study of the effects of fluorinated dienophiles in Diels&#8208;Alder cycloadditions is disclosed, along with insights into the origin of reaction rate deceleration and the factors controlling endo&#8208; vs. exo&#8208;selectivity. In addition, the design and synthesis of a Br&#248;nsted acid activated fluorinated dienophile facilitating charge&#8208;enhanced Diels&#8208;Alder reactivity is reported.







Abstract
Fluorinated molecules are core to contemporary drug discovery programs and critical for advancing innovation in numerous fields. In merging these important chemical themes, fluorinated Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition products are a particularly attractive subset of compounds with significant utility. Herein, an in&#8208;depth computational and experimental study of fluorine substitution effects on dienophile partners in Diels&#8208;Alder reactions is reported. Of particular focus to this study is understanding the origin of reaction rate deceleration as a consequence of employing fluorinated dienophiles and the factors controlling endo&#8208; vs. exo&#8208;selectivity. To unlock insight into this unique reactivity, density function theory calculations, distortion/interaction&#8208;activation strain models, energy decomposition analysis and natural bond orbital analysis, among other computational methods, were applied. In addition, the influence of oriented external&#8208;electric&#8208;field&#8208;effects (OEEFs) and local electric field effects were explored. To further probe this effect, experimental studies of charge&#8208;enhanced Diels&#8208;Alder reactivity with fluorinated dienophiles were conducted. Collectively, this work offers novel mechanistic understanding pertinent to Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of fluorinated dienophiles providing valuable fluorinated scaffolds.

         <title>Exploring Self&#8208;Assembly and Viscoelastic Behavior of Pyrene&#8208;Based Fluorescent Hydrogel: Designing Paper Sensors for Water&#8208;Soluble Explosives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently organic&#8208;doped polyethyleneimine based hydrogels have emerged as smart responsive materials for optical sensing applications. To this end, herein we have designed and synthesized a biocompatible fluorescent hydrogel based on polyethyleneimine (PEI), incorporating pyrene as the polyaromatic signaling moiety. The self&#8208;assembly properties of the composite materials were primarily influenced by the nature of the organic dopant, the degree of substitution, and the microenvironment. The presence of the polyaromatic scaffold, such as pyrene, not only affects the fluorescence properties of the molecules but also modulates the extent of cross&#8208;linking by controlling &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. The hydrogel formation was observed in a methanol&#8208;water (3% v/v) mixture. Additionally, the pyrene&#8208;attached hydrogel demonstrated promising potential for the highly sensitive detection of trinitrophenol (TNP), a toxic, water&#8208;soluble explosive. Spectroscopic investigations revealed that the electrostatic interaction between the ammonium units of PYR&#8208;PEI and picrate anions in aqueous medium facilitated charge transfer from pyrene to the picrate anion, resulting in a fluorescence turn&#8208;off response. Along with fluorometric response, using rheological experiments we show that the viscoelastic behaviour of the polymer gels also varied significantly upon addition of TNP.</dc:description>

         <title>Cs2CO3&#8208;I2 Promoted Efficient Synthesis of Flavones and Flavanones: Total Synthesis of Narengenin and Apigenin</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a green synergistic combination of I2, Cs2CO3, and H2O systematically utilised to produce varied flavones and flavanones in a one&#8208;pot manner that includes numerous bioactive compounds along with the natural products naringenin and apigenin.







Abstract
Flavonoids are an important class of naturally existing scaffolds known for their diverse biological activities and have been immensely synthesized using stoichiometric reagent amounts. Herein, we report a reliable, robust, one&#8208;pot, transition metal and additive&#8208;free protocol for the synthesis of flavones and flavanones from 2&#8208;hydroxyacetophenone and substituted aldehydes. Our developed method utilizes Cs2CO3 as a base and iodine as an oxidant in H2O: DMSO (9&#8201;:&#8201;1) solvent system, which provides direct access to many flavones and flavanones in excellent yields under milder reaction conditions with simple yet easily available substrates. In application, naturally occurring compounds such as naringenin and apigenin have been successfully synthesized using developed protocol.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Direct Synthesis of Secondary Amides and Nitriles Using O&#8208;(2&#8208;Pyrimidinyl)&#8208;N&#8208;Boc Hydroxylamine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explored the first application of the novel O&#8208;(2&#8208;pyrimidinyl)&#8208;N&#8208;Boc hydroxylamine reagent for the direct synthesis of secondary amides and nitriles from ketones and aldehydes via the Beckmann rearrangement. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) indicates that this reagent is more stable than similar alternatives. This protocol offers notable advantages: it is operationally simple, mild, metal&#8208;free, conducted in open air, scalable, operates at ambient temperature, high yields, and demonstrates good functional group tolerance.







Abstract
A novel hydroxylamine&#8208;derived aminating agent, O&#8208;(2&#8208;pyrimidinyl)&#8208;N&#8208;Boc hydroxylamine (PymONHBoc), has been designed and synthesized, from readily available 2&#8208;chloropyrimidine. This reagent demonstrates superior shelf stability and ease of handling compared to other hydroxylamine&#8208;derived reagents. Here, we present a metal&#8208;free method for the direct conversion of ketones and aldehydes into sec&#8208;amides and nitriles using PymONHBoc as the aminating agent. This method efficiently converts a wide range of aliphatic and aromatic carbonyl compounds into the corresponding amides and nitriles with good to excellent yields under ambient conditions. The use of PymONHBoc is advantageous, as it facilitates the in&#8197;situ generation of the activated oxime intermediate, concomitantly producing a non&#8208;interfering byproduct.

         <title>Greening the Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Dihydrobenzofuran Selenides: I2/TBHP&#8208;Promoted Selenocyclization of 2&#8208;Allylphenols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative and green method to produce 2&#8208;[(organoselanyl)methyl]&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans promoted by the I2/TBHP oxidant system was developed. The reactions occur in only one minute in the presence of different 2&#8208;allylphenols and diorganyl diselenides at room temperature using 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% I2 and 0.30&#8197;mmol of TBHP in the absence of solvent to obtain fifteen compounds in yields up to 93&#8201;%.







Abstract
In this work we describe the synthesis of selenium&#8208;containing dihydrobenzofurans through the selenocyclization reaction of 2&#8208;allylphenols. The reaction procedure uses only an I2/TBHP oxidant system at room temperature, enabling an efficient synthesis of 2&#8208;[(organoselanyl)methyl]&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans. The products are formed immediately after the addition of the oxidant system in a mixture of 2&#8208;allylphenol and diorganyl diselenide, in the absence of solvent, at mild experimental conditions. Furthermore, control experiments were carried out, including 77Se NMR analyses to identify intermediates, which contributed to the elucidation of the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Theoretical Investigation on the Copper&#8208;Catalyzed&#160;anti&#8208;Selective 1,2&#8208;Silylboration of Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanism of a copper&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and anti&#8208;selective 1,2&#8208;silylboration of internal alkynes was theoretically studied to understand the reaction pathway and the origin of selectivity. The proposed overall reaction pathway involves the syn&#8208;to&#8208;anti isomerization via an anionic allenic transition state stabilized by the conjugation with the benzene ring. The anti&#8208;selectivity is determined at the borylation step and controlled by the steric effect of the silyl group introduced on the alkyne carbon. The computational results obtained in this study are highly informative for the development of new catalytic transformations involving syn/anti&#8208;isomerization processes.</dc:description>

         <title>O&#8208;Doped Carbon Nitride: A Recyclable, Metal&#8208;free Photocatalyst for Oxidative Amidation of Aromatic Aldehydes and Amines under Visible Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative amidation of aldehydes with amines is a promising strategy for the synthesis of valuable amides. However, conventional methods often use toxic oxidants and additives, resulting in the generation of chemical waste. In this study, we report the catalytic oxidative amidation of aldehydes with amines using molecular oxygen under additive &amp; metal&#8208;free conditions in visible light, facilitated by an oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nitride (OCN) catalyst. The OCN catalyst shows excellent activity in the production of various amides, demonstrating high functional group tolerance. Furthermore, the OCN catalyst can be reused several times without loss of activity.</dc:description>

         <title>From Enzyme Encapsulation to Environmental Solutions: Photostable Laccase in Dopc Vesicles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The laccase enzyme offers significant advantages for the removal of organic contaminants; but its stability and effectiveness in bioremediation can be compromised by photo&#8208;induced degradation processes. To address this challenge, we investigated the immobilization of laccase in unilamellar and multilamellar vesicles of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) as a means to enhance its photo&#8208;stability while preserving its catalytic activity. Enzymatic activity was evaluated spectroscopically for both free and encapsulated laccase, before and after UVB irradiation.







Abstract
The laccase enzyme offers significant advantages for the removal of organic contaminants; but its stability and effectiveness in bioremediation can be compromised by photo&#8208;induced degradation processes. To address this challenge, we investigated the immobilization of laccase in unilamellar and multilamellar vesicles of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) as a means to enhance its photo&#8208;stability while preserving its catalytic activity. Enzymatic activity was evaluated spectroscopically for both free and encapsulated laccase, before and after UVB irradiation. Our results demonstrate that DOPC vesicles effectively encapsulate the laccase enzyme, maintaining its activity within the vesicles. Moreover, the substrate syringaldazine, a model compound for laccase activity studies, was able to permeate through the bilayer. Notably, encapsulated laccase exhibited significantly higher retention of enzymatic activity (REA) post&#8208;irradiation compared to the free enzyme. In conclusion, both unilamellar and multilamellar vesicles provide substantial photoprotection for laccase against UVB light. This protective effect is attributed to the enzyme's confinement within a system that scatters high&#8208;energy photons. Furthermore, the simplicity and ease of large&#8208;scale production of multilamellar vesicles present an advantageous option for various applications, including bioremediation.

         <dc:description>
Attempts to synthesize 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;alkylaminoethyl&#8208;1,1&#8208;bisphosphonates as potential antiparasitic agents from tetraethyl 2&#8208;arylvinylidenebisphosphonate and a suitable alkyl amine led to (E)&#8208;N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1&#8208;arylmethaimines instead of the expected Michael&#8208;type adduct. This chemical behavior was not observed when used mercaptans as soft nucleophiles resulting in the corresponding sulfur'&#8208;containing Michael&#8208;type adducts.

Encouraged by the potent inhibitory effect exhibited by long chain 2&#8208;alkylaminoethyl&#8208;1,1&#8208;bisphosphonates against proliferation of the clinically more relevant form of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease), and against tachyzoites of Toxoplasma gondii, the responsible agent of toxoplasmosis, it was conceived a new series of structurally related 1,1&#8208;bisphosphonates bearing a phenyl group at the C&#8208;2 position of the title compounds. The synthetic approach to access these compounds employed a Michael&#8208;type addition by reaction of tetraethyl 2&#8208;phenylvinylidenebisphosphonate or substituted phenyl group with a suitable amine. To our surprise the reaction experienced a retro&#8208;Michael type reaction resulting in an imine formation instead of the hypothetical and expected Michael&#8208;type adduct. Obtainment of the imine derivatives was observed regardless of the nature of the substituent at the phenyl moiety. The source of the alkyl chain was the alkyl group of the amine substrate. Interestingly, when mercaptans were used as soft nucleophiles, the Michael&#8208;type adducts were obtained in all cases.

&lt;p&gt;Attempts to synthesize 2-aryl-2-alkylaminoethyl-1,1-bisphosphonates as potential antiparasitic agents from tetraethyl 2-arylvinylidenebisphosphonate and a suitable alkyl amine led to (E)-N-alkyl-1-arylmethaimines instead of the expected Michael-type adduct. This chemical behavior was not observed when used mercaptans as soft nucleophiles resulting in the corresponding sulfur'-containing Michael-type adducts. A reasonable reaction mechanism was proposed.

         <title>Trimethylsilyl Polyphosphate Promoted Efficient Synthesis of 4(3H)&#8208;Quinazolinones from Methyl Anthranilate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 4(3H)&#8208;quinazolinones with variable steric and electronic features were synthesized with good to excellent yields by trimethylsilylpolyphosphate (PPSE) promoted reaction of secondary amides and methyl anthranilates. The reaction is metal and ligand free, involving easily available starting materials, and suitable for scaling up. The one pot modification, which comprises 2 or 3 steps, was also efficient.







Abstract
A trimethylsilyl polyphosphate (PPSE) promoted synthesis of 4(3H)&#8208;quinazolinones, a heterocycle with wide biological potential, from methyl anthranilate and secondary amides is described. The procedure is general, involves very easily available starting materials, shows functional group tolerance and leads to good to excellent yields. The method proved to be suitable for scaling&#8208;up. A one&#8208;pot approach was also explored. This step&#8208;economic modification reduces the time, waste and environmental impact of the synthesis and leads to satisfactory global yields that include 2 or 3 single steps. Finally, a possible reaction mechanism that involves a nitrilium cation intermediate is proposed.

A facile and efficient method has been developed to access sulfone&#8208;containing 1,3&#8208;enynes through a palladium&#8208;catalyzed domino radical sulfonylation and alkynylation of simple alkynes.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed domino radical sulfonylation and alkynylation of simple alkynes has been developed for the rapid construction of privileged scaffolds containing sulfone and 1,3&#8208;enyne motifs. The reaction of sulfonyl iodide with simple alkynes proceeded smoothly under mild conditions to afford a variety of sulfone&#8208;containing 1,3&#8208;enynes in good yields and with excellent selectivities.

Conditions for the palladium&#8208;catalyzed C4,C5&#8208;diarylation of ethyl isoxazole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylate through double C&#8722;H bond activation are reported. This methodology, which employs commercially available substrates, an inexpensive base and an air&#8208;stable catalyst, provides simple one&#8208;pot access to a wide variety of C4,C5&#8208;diarylated isoxazoles, allowing straightforward tuning of their properties.







Abstract
The Pd&#8208;catalyzed C4&#8208;arylation of 3,5&#8208;disubstituted isoxazoles via C&#8722;H bond functionalization has been largely described. By contrast, the reactivity of isoxazoles in C&#8722;H bond functionalization with both unsubstituted C4 and C5 positions remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report on the reactivity in Pd&#8208;catalyzed double C&#8722;H bond arylation of an isoxazole with unsubstituted C4 and C5 positions. Conditions for the palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct C4,C5&#8208;diarylation of ethyl isoxazole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylate using aryl bromides as the aryl source are reported. This procedure tolerates several useful substituents on the aryl bromide such as nitrile, acetyl, formyl, benzoyl, alkoxycarbonyl, chloro, fluoro, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, cyanomethyl, tertbutyl and methoxy at para&#8208; and meta&#8208;positions. Conversely, with ortho&#8208;substituted aryl bromides, mixtures of mono&#8208; and di&#8208;arylated isoxazoles were generally obtained. This methodology provides a simple one pot access to a wide variety of C4,C5&#8208;diarylated isoxazoles from commercially available substrates allowing to modify easily their biological properties.

         <title>A Green Synthetic Approach to Construct C2&#8208;Quaternary Indolin&#8208;3&#8208;Ones at Room Temperature via Regioselective Oxidative Dearomatization of Indoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we have developed a novel and simple synthetic approach for producing diverse indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one using oxidant TBHP and In(OTf)3 catalyst at ambient temperature under solvent&#8208;free conditions, exhibiting regioselectivity and excellent functional group tolerance.







Abstract
A new synthetic strategy for the construction of C2&#8208;quaternary indole for the formation of Indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones has been explored via indium(III) trifluoromethansulphonate catalyst at room temperature with TBHP as a green oxidant in water. This approach for the oxidative dearomatization process allows for the production of the natural product Halichrome A and a broad range of C2&#8208;arylated Indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones under a milder condition in very good yields. The oxidative self&#8208;dimerization and self&#8208;trimerization of various indole derivatives have also been achieved under the same conditions.

Axially chiral biaryl aldehydes are esteemed as valuable precursors for the development of innovative chiral catalysts, playing a pivotal role across a broad spectrum of research disciplines.The synthesis of axially chiral biaryl aldehydes with various structural features has been developed by reacting biaryl dialdehyde with aromatic amine in the presence of chiral phosphoric acid (CPA). It shows excellent enantioselectivity, mild conditions and good compatibility with different functional groups. These structures serve as promising precursors for a range of subsequent chemical transformations and are likely to have potential applications in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral ligands or catalysts.







Abstract
Axially chiral biaryl aldehydes are precursors for the synthesis of axially chiral compounds and novel chiral catalysts of great interest, which play vital roles in extensive research fields. However, limited strategies exist for the efficient synthesis of axially chiral aldehydes, and the construction of structurally diverse axially chiral aldehydes remains challenging. Herein, a strategy is reported for the synthesis of biaryl axially chiral aldehydes with varying structures from biaryl dialdehydes and aromatic amines in the presence of a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst. This protocol features excellent enantioselectivity, mild conditions, and good functional&#8208;group tolerance.

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine Catalyzed Cascade C&#8722;H Functionalization: An Atom&#8208;Economical Strategy to Access Diverse 2&#8208;Substituted Benzothiazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward route to substituted benzothiazoles involving C&#8722;H functionalization at room temperature under metal&#8208;free conditions obviates the conventional use of aryl aldehyde/carboxylic acid precursors to make benzothiazoles. The method makes use of readily available and unfunctionalized materials to afford a diverse range of the target products, including the synthesis of active antitumor drug GW 610.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free 4,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;iodobenzoic acid catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization strategy has been developed for the synthesis of 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl benzothiazoles from aryl isothiocyanates and unfunctionalized arenes/thiophenes/furans at room temperature. The procedure entails one&#8208;pot cascade carbon&#8722;carbon and carbon&#8722;sulfur bond formation facilitated by triflic acid, which serves as both a Br&#248;nsted acid and a ligand source at the in&#8197;situ generated I(III) center. This process is atom&#8208;economical and offers benefits over existing protocols for synthesizing benzothiazoles in terms of ease of use, eco&#8208;friendliness, and not requiring the typical use of aryl aldehyde/carboxylic acid precursors. Mechanistic studies were carried out, and the synthetic utility of the protocol was demonstrated for the synthesis of the benzothiazole&#8208;based antitumor drug GW&#8208;610.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of N,O&#8208;Doped Aceanthrylenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
N,O&#8208;Doped aceanthrylenes are prepared by combination of selective SNAr reaction or Ullmann&#8208;coupling of phenols, followed by an intramolecular direct arylation. The aromatic behavior of the hitherto unknown heterocyclic scaffold has been further analyzed by NICS and NICS2BC calculations.







Abstract
N,O&#8208;doped aceanthrylenes have been synthesized for the first time via a selective SNAr reaction or Ullmann&#8208;coupling of phenols, followed by an intramolecular direct arylation. The reaction has been carefully optimized and permits the selective synthesis of N,O&#8208;doped aceanthrylenes in moderate to excellent yields and tolerate various functional groups. The aromatic behavior of the hitherto unknown heterocyclic scaffold has been further analyzed by NICS and NICS2BC calculations.

         <title>NHC&#8208;Catalyzed, Microwave&#8208;Assisted and Base&#8208;Dependent Reactions of Substituted Cinnamaldehydes Towards &#947;&#8208;Lactones or Saturated Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
10 NHCs were used as organocatalysts using microwacve irradiation and depending on the base used to generate the free carbene, &#947;&#8208;lactones or saturated esters were prepared from aryl&#8208;substituted cinnamaldehydes. Novel NHC hydrochloride salts and &#947;&#8208;lactones are reported together with the optimum reaction conditions and the broad scope of both reactions.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) generated from imidazolium, imidazopyridinium and imidazoquinolinium hydrochlorides in&#8197;situ using base and microwave irradiation were employed as organocatalysts to yield homoenolates from cinnamaldehyde and its aryl&#8208;substituted analogs. Depending on the catalytic base either &#947;&#8208;lactones were prepared when the strong base tBuOK was used or the corresponding saturated ethyl 3&#8208;aryl propionates were synthesized with the milder DIPEA base. Novel imidazopyridinium and imidazoquinolinium hydrochlorides were synthesized and were compared to commercially available NHCs IMes and IDip for their catalytic activity. The optimum reaction conditions were established using IMes and the broad scope of both reactions was investigated using the 4 most efficient NHCs.

         <title>Aryl&#8208;Fluorocyclopropane &#946;&#8208;Lactams with Activity Against Mycobacteroides abscessus and Mycobacterium bovis BCG</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluorocyclopropyl &#946;&#8208;lactams have been prepared. The most active compound displayed good activity against clinically challenging Mycobacteria such as M. bovis BCG (MIC 0.39&#8197;mg/mL). The compounds were designed to exploit a fluoride ion elimination mechanism concomitant with &#946;&#8208;lactam ring opening, as the basis of a mechanism induced trigger.







Abstract
A novel series of aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluorocyclopropyl 1 and &#945;,&#946;,&#946;&#8208;trifluorocyclopropyl 2 &#946;&#8208;lactams have been prepared and their activity explored across various Mycobacteria and also the ESKAPE panel of pathogens. The most active of these compounds 1&#8201;a displayed good activity against clinically challenging Mycobacteria such as M. bovis BCG (MIC 0.39&#8197;mg/mL)) and did not show any significant activity against the ESKAPE pathogens indicating selectivity for this otherwise challenging class of pathogen. Compound 1&#8201;a was however rapidly metabolised and toxic to a human model cell line (HepG2) limiting its clinical development at this stage. The compounds were designed to exploit a fluoride ion elimination mechanism concomitant with &#946;&#8208;lactam ring opening, as the basis of a mechanism induced trigger to generate a reactive intermediate (suicide inhibition). In model alkoxide reactions a representative from both classes 1 and 2 resulted in &#946;&#8208;lactam ring opening but only the more active mono&#8208;fluoro cyclopropane series 1 triggered fluoride ion elimination after ring opening and this may form the basis of its activity.

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of Thiazole&#8208;5&#8208;thione Based on [2+3] Annulation Trapping of &#945;&#8208;Keto Sulfine with Thioamide</title>

         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel regioselective formal [2+3] cyclization reaction using &#945;&#8208;keto sulfines derived from arylacyl sulfoxides and thioamides. The method enables the synthesis of thiazole&#8208;5&#8208;thiones in a step&#8208;economic, one&#8208;pot process without catalysts, showcasing a new approach for constructing dithioate (S=C&#8722;S&#8722;) skeletons through a tandem sequence of reactions.







Abstract
Aiming to develop novel annulation reactions using sulfine intermediates, we have established a regioselective formal [2+3] cyclization reaction of &#945;&#8208;keto sulfines generated from the elimination of arylacyl sulfoxides and thioamides. This new strategy allows for the synthesis of thiazole&#8208;5&#8208;thiones directly without catalysts or additives. The approach features a step&#8208;economic, one&#8208;pot characteristics via a tandem sequence of in&#8197;situ &#945;&#8208;keto sulfines generation, regiospecifically nucleophilic attack or [3+2] cyclizatoin, dithioate (S=C&#8722;S&#8722;) skeletons formation, and subsequent intramolecular nucleophilic cyclization. This reaction also represents a novel method for constructing dithioate (S=C&#8722;S&#8722;) skeletons.

         <title>Asymmetrically Fused Nanographene&#8208;Porphyrin Architectures</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenyl, pyrene, and hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) fragments are assembled around a central porphyrin core and interconnected under oxidative Scholl conditions to achieve the merging of the individual &#960;&#8208;systems. The three asymmetric porphyrin conjugates obtained this way exhibit intriguing optical features.







Abstract
A strategy to combine three standalone aromatic building blocks in one coherent, fully conjugated molecule is presented. Namely, benzene, pyrene, and hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) are assembled around a central porphyrin core in an ABAC type of geometry and interconnected under oxidative Scholl conditions to achieve merging of the individual &#960;&#8208;systems. The three asymmetric porphyrin conjugates obtained this way exhibit intriguing absorption features, namely strongly red&#8208;shifted and broadened spectra. The presented series of molecules demonstrates the ability to control and influence these optical properties with high precision by altering the size of the aromatic system in a controlled manner. Density functional theory calculations gave more profound insights into the electronic structure and optical transitions of the investigated fused architectures.

The Front Cover shows an old&#8208;school slot machine with symbols representing porphyrin, pyrene, hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene, and phenyl printed on its reels. The reels have stopped at the point where all three possible asymmetric combinations of porphyrin with the other aromatic fragments are reached. As these &#946;&#8208;meso five&#8208;ring fused architectures resemble the target molecules in our work, this outcome leads to the release of the machine&#8242;s jackpot in the form of pentagon&#8208;shaped coins, highlighting the fusion motif.

         <title>Rare Earth Metal Reagents in Organic Synthesis: A Comprehensive Review</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare earth elements, as an important part of the periodic table, not only represent a frontier area but also possess unique chemical and physical properties that are distinct from those of main group elements and transition metals. Exploiting these unique characteristics to develop reaction systems not only holds profound academic value but also demonstrates extensive practical applications.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;mediated organic synthesis has significantly advanced the field of synthetic chemistry over the decades. While transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions have become foundational, characterized by well&#8208;understood mechanisms like oxidative addition and reductive elimination, rare earth metals have not received as much attention. This review aims to highlight the synthetic applications of rare earth metals, fostering increased interest in their exploration. We discuss various reactions facilitated by these metals, including substitution, addition, insertion into unsaturated bonds, and coupling reactions, showcasing their unique capabilities and potential in modern synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Modern Methods for Conjugated Polymers Preparation: A Concept of Transition Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated polymers (CPs) are promising organic materials currently at the center of the organic electronics revolution. Synthesis strategies play a crucial role in the rise of this field, and this review aims to shed light on transition metal&#8208;free organic chemistry for the synthesis of conjugated polymers, which is currently experiencing a renaissance.







Abstract
Cross&#8208;coupling technology is still the cornerstone of conjugated polymer synthesis. However, most cross&#8208;coupling reactions rely on platinum group metals (e.&#8201;g. rhodium, palladium, iridium and platinum), and the supply of these rare and expensive metal catalysts is at risk, making the use of these reactions unsustainable. In addition, the contamination of conjugated polymers with trace metallic catalysts is another concern, especially for organic electronics where the products are used in devices whose performance can be affected by even &#8242;undetectable&#8217; levels of metal contaminant. In pursuit of more sustainable chemistry in the future, various organic reactions have been utilized for the synthesis of conjugated polymers without the aid of transition&#8208;metal catalysts. Presented herein is a comprehensive overview of organic reactions for the synthesis of conjugated polymers that go beyond transition metal&#8208;catalysed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. We discuss metal&#8208;free synthesis strategies and methods in detail and divide them into &#8220;condensation&#8221; reactions, &#8220;click&#8221; reactions and other miscellaneous reactions. Reaction mechanisms and key intermediates are also elucidated. The aim is to provide researchers and practitioners with valuable insights that will enable them to innovate and expand the horizons of conjugated polymer synthesis.

         <dc:description>
This review explores recent advancements in the synthesis of xanthones, focusing on the transition from stoichiometric to catalytic methodologies, including homogeneous and heterogeneous approaches. Key environmental metrics, solvent selection, and reaction steps, among others, are analysed, showcasing the potential of modern catalytic techniques to develop greener synthetic processes.







Abstract
The transition from traditional stoichiometric methods to catalytic processes has significantly advanced the synthesis of xanthones, privileged structures with diverse biological activities. This review critically examines various homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic methodologies, emphasising their efficiency, and adherence to green chemistry principles. Through comparative analysis of key metrics such as Reaction Mass Efficiency (RME), Process Mass Intensity (PMI), E&#8208;factor, and Turnover Number (TON), we highlight the superior performance of heterogeneous catalysts, which demonstrate high reusability, selectivity, and minimal waste generation. The choice of solvent, a crucial factor in the environmental footprint of these processes, is also assessed, focusing on greener alternatives. The robust nature and economic viability of heterogeneous catalysts make them ideal for large&#8208;scale applications, offering suitable solutions for more environmentally&#8208;friendly xanthone production. Furthermore, the reduction in by&#8208;products and the importance of catalyst purity in pharmaceutical applications are discussed, underscoring the relevance of these advancements in meeting the rigorous standards of the industry. This review provides valuable insights into the ongoing evolution of catalytic strategies in xanthone synthesis, driving future developments in medicinal chemistry and green chemistry.

         <title>Rhodium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrogenative Transformations of N&#8208;Sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;Triazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles have emerged as a powerful tool for many annulations, X&#8722;H bond insertions or functionalizations under rhodium catalysis. The reaction of N&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles with Rh(II) complexes gives rise to highly electrophilic &#945;&#8208;imino rhodium carbene intermediates that can be readily incorporated to construct various nitrogen&#8208;based building blocks. Considering the significant importance of N&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles in synthetic chemistry, in this review, we have described Rh&#8208;catalyzed transformations of this valuable synthon since 2014.







Abstract
N&#8208;Sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles are valuable precursors for the generation of &#945;&#8208;imino carbene intermediates in the presence of the metal catalysts, especially rhodium(II) complexes. Due to the presence of electrophilic carbene and nucleophilic nitrogen, these reactive intermediates can easily be incorporated into many annulations, cycloadditions, C&#8722;H or O/N/S&#8722;H bond insertions and functionalization reactions. A large number of pharmaceutically important nitrogen&#8208;based building blocks can be constructed via this direct and atom&#8208;economical carbene strategy. In this review, we have described the transformations of N&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles based on &#945;&#8208;imino rhodium(II) carbene intermediates.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches for the Construction of Chiral Aziridines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optically active aziridines represent an important class of rigid three&#8208;membered nitrogen&#8208;heterocyclics because they are privileged structural frameworks in biologically and pharmacologically relevant natural products. This review is to summarize complementary assembly of optically active aziridines in recent years, as well as their applications in the agrochemical and pharmaceutical industry.







Abstract
Optically active aziridines represent a pivotal class of rigid three&#8208;membered nitrogen&#8208;heterocyclic compounds found in natural products, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and functional motifs, which have demonstrated outstanding practicability as therapeutic molecular frameworks, versatile synthetic endpoints, and functional materials in both academic and industrial communities. Recent years have witnessed a broad spectrum of prominent breakthroughs in the field of chiral aziridines due to the aziridine&#8208;based rigid and three&#8208;dimensional pharmacophores, which have resulted in streamlining the drug discovery process. Over the past few decades, particular attention has been directed towards the strategically efficient, versatile, and practical assembly of optically active aziridines. These synthesis approaches have demonstrated great potential in the context of the construction of pharmaceutical molecules, biologically and pharmacologically relevant natural products, and functional materials. In this review, several synthetic strategies for the assembly of chiral aziridines are summarized, which could be divided into five categories: (1) Introduction; (2) Construction of optically active aziridines via reactions of olefines with nitrene sources; (3) Construction of optically active aziridines via reactions of imines with carbenes; (4) Construction of optically active aziridines via reaction of azirines; (5) Construction of optically active aziridines via intramolecular cyclization of amine derivatives.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Directed Regioselective Cascade Reaction with Diazo Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green, efficient and highly regioselective synthesis of pyrazoles and their derivatives from the combination of two different diazo compounds to afford N&#8208;substituted using CF3CH2OTf as reaction medium was developed, without any catalysts.







Abstract
A tandem system comprising cyclization reaction of diazo compound and cross&#8208;coupling of the other one has been developed. This provides facile access to pyrazoles and there derivatives with high levels of regioselectivity in moderate to good yields. This process uniquely utilizes CF3CH2OTf both as a solvent and a catalyst under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies provide insights into the intricate sequence involved in the formation of pyrazoles and further selective cross&#8208;coupling with another diazo compound.

The features of this protocol include the use of readily available raw materials, molecular oxygen as the oxidant, it being free of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyst, and convenient method for the preparation of &#960;&#8208;extended dibenzo[a,c]carbazoles.

Abstract
In this work, we present an efficient Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalysed intramolecular hydroamination reaction of homopropargyl N&#8208;tosyl amides to produce synthetically useful substituted &#947;&#8208;lactams through the corresponding alkynyl phenyl selenide intermediates. Our focus on optimising the cyclisation protocol under flow conditions has led to a significant enhancement in efficiency, thereby reducing the time and resources required for the process. DFT calculations of the reaction mechanism for the catalytic transformation of a model alkynyl phenyl selenide were also conducted.

         <title>Multicomponent Modular Synthesis of Thioacetals by Using Dichloromethane as the C1 Synthon Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot multicomponent strategy for the modular synthesis of a series of thioacetals by using stable and abundant feedstock chemical DCM as a C1 source was developed. This work provides not only an excellent complementary strategy to the established thioacetals synthesis, but also a new platform for DCM application.







Abstract
Thioacetals are an important category of sulfur&#8208;containing compounds and versatile building blocks. Therefore, there is growing demand for the development of practical and modular methods to access various thioacetals from inexpensive and readily available commodity chemicals. Herein, we describe a novel one&#8208;pot multicomponent protocol for thioacetals synthesis, especially benzylthio thioacetals synthesis, by employing feedstock chemical dichloromethane (DCM) as the C1 source under metal&#8208;free, mild and simple conditions. Furthermore, its synthetic utility is further demonstrated by the preparation of deuterated thioacetals, large&#8208;scale synthesis and broad functional group compatibility. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate the dual roles of DBU as both a proton scavenger and a nucleophilic catalyst. This work provides not only an excellent complementary strategy to the established thioacetals synthesis, but also a new platform for DCM application.

         <title>Carboxylic Acid&#8208;Catalysed Transamidation of Boc&#8208;Protected Diketopiperazines (Boc&#8208;DKPs) for Peptide Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 4&#8208;methoxybenzoic acid catalyst drastically accelerated the transamidation of Boc&#8208;DKPs with amino acid esters. This reaction progressed rapidly, and various tripeptides bearing D&#8208;proline residues were synthesised within 30&#8197;min in good&#8208;to&#8208;high yields. Notably, this method also allowed the preparation of longer tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208;, and hexapeptides.







Abstract
A carboxylic acid&#8208;catalysed transamidation of Boc&#8208;protected diketopiperazines (Boc&#8208;DKPs) was developed in this study, which allowed access to various tripeptides featuring a D&#8208;proline residue in good&#8208;to&#8208;high yields within 30&#8197;min. Subsequent coupling reactions between the Boc&#8208;DKPs and di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetrapeptide esters were successfully performed, furnishing the corresponding tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208;, and hexapeptides.

A novel Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid catalyzed aldehydes insertion reaction with maleimide&#8208;based 1, n&#8208;C, O/N&#8208;synthons has been developed, involving a high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity [6/7 + 1] or [3 + 1 + 1 + 1] manner.Two types of structurally diverse medium&#8208;sized heterocycles were synthesized in good to excellent yields and with excellent selectivity in this tandem annulations, including dihydrobenzo[1,5]oxazocines and pyrrolo[3,4&#8208; d]tetrahydropyrimidines.







Abstract
Aldehydes as one of the most widely building blocks, have been frequently utilized as privileged C1 electrophile units and exhibited versatile applications to construct carbon&#8208;heteroatom and carbon&#8208;carbon bond. We herein described a novel Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid catalyzed aldehydes insertion reaction with maleimide&#8208;based 1, n&#8208;C, O/N&#8208;synthons, involving a high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity [6/7 + 1]or [3 + 1 + 1 + 1]manner. The maleimide&#8208;based 1, n&#8208;C, O/N&#8208;synthons (n = 3, 6, 7) were originally designed and developed by our group which were used as flexible bisnucleophiles. By this tandem annulations approach, two types of structurally diverse medium&#8208;sized heterocycles were synthesized in good to excellent yields (74&#8211;91&#8201;%) and with excellent selectivity, including dihydrobenzo[1,5]oxazocines (24 examples) and pyrrolo[3,4&#8208; d]tetrahydropyrimidines (22 examples). Significantly, formaldehyde, long&#8208;chain aliphatic aldehydes and aromatic aldehydes can act as C1 electrophile units catalyzed by racemic BINOL&#8208;derived phosphoric acid catalyst in these transformations, which then selectively attacked the OH or NH group bearing in functionalized maleimides and underwent the formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O or C&#8722;N bond in a short time under microwave irradiation conditions.

         <title>Recent Development of DNA&#8208;based Biohybrid Systems Driven by Light</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Merging the fields of photochemistry and DNA&#8208;based materials paved the way for unprecedented reactivities and applications. This review focuses on recent developments around the design of biohybrid DNA&#8208;based nanosystems driven by light with a particular emphasis on cross&#8208;linking and ligation reactions, programmable photo&#8208;release and DNA&#8208;encoded libraries.







Abstract
Photochemistry has provided a powerful alternative to generate reactive intermediates under mild reaction conditions and photobiocatalysis is currently widely applied in organic synthesis. While enzyme&#8208;based photocatalysis has attracted a lot of attention, light&#8208;driven DNA&#8208;based biohybrid systems are also increasingly being applied to a large variety of applications from molecular imaging to enantioselective catalysis, and other fields such as DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DELs). This review gives insights into these research fields by classifying the existing light&#8208;driven DNA&#8208;based biohybrid systems developed to date.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Zeolite Catalyzed Dehydrative N&#8208;Benzylation of Amides for the Construction of Macrolactams under Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of acyclic amides and macrolactams has been demonstrated successfully via N&#8208;benzylation of amides using a highly reusable heterogeneous Ru&#8208;Zeolite as a catalyst, which gives only water as the byproduct. N&#8208;Benzylation of acyclic amides furnished 30 N&#8208;benzylated amides whereas intramolecular N&#8208;benzylation with alcohols was well tolerated with 15 examples of macrolactams bearing 11&#8208; to 15&#8208;membered rings. Notably, the scalability of this flow process has been demonstrated from milligrams to gram scale using the Ru&#8208;Zeolite heterogeneous catalyst. Moreover, the reusability of the catalyst is exemplified by the 16 reaction cycles carried out with one time&#8208;packed heterogeneous catalyst in the reactor bed.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Trideuteromethyl Sulfide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the rapid development of new trideuteromethylthiolation reagents, this review first outlines the indirect introduction of trideuteromethylthiol groups, and then discusses the direct nucleophilic, electrophilic and free radical trideuteromethylthiolation methods.







Abstract
The methylthio group plays a significant role in antitumor bioactive molecules, candidate drugs and natural products. Deuteration modification of drugs, which could prolong the half&#8208;life, reduce toxicity, and enhance targeting, has become an important strategy in the development and discovery of innovative drugs. Combining the unique properties of the methylthio group with the deuteration effect, the rapid introduction of trideuteromethylthiol groups into small organic molecules is essential for advancing the research and development of deuterated drugs. With the rapid development of new trideuteromethylthiolation reagents, this review first outlines the indirect introduction of trideuteromethylthiol groups, and then discusses the direct nucleophilic, electrophilic and free radical trideuteromethylthiolation methods.

         <title>An Efficient Synthetic Methodology for the Preparation of Glycosyl &#946;&#8208;diketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report presents an efficient methodology to prepare glycosyl &#946;&#8208;diketones from the corresponding allyl glycosyl ethers. The synthetic route is suitable for acid&#8208; and base&#8208;sensitive protecting groups, and the reactions proceed with retention of the anomeric configuration. Additionally, the synthetic route afforded other useful compounds, such as glycosyl isoxazolines and &#946;&#8208;hydroxyketones, which can be employed in further synthetic and biological studies.







Abstract
In this study, we present a synthetic methodology for preparing glycosyl &#946;&#8208;diketones from the corresponding allyl ethers. The process involves three steps: nitrile oxide cycloadditions, reduction of the glycosyl isoxazolines, and oxidation of &#946;&#8208;hydroxyketones. This route is suitable for acid&#8208; and base&#8208;sensitive protecting groups, and the reactions were conducted with retention of the anomeric configuration. The resulting glycosyl &#946;&#8208;diketones were then utilized in the synthesis of the corresponding pyrazoles.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Tetracyclic Heteroarenes via Platinum&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of Ethynylbiaryl Precursors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of naphthannulated S&#8208;, O&#8208;, and N&#8208;heteroaryl compounds from isomeric ethynylbiaryl starting materials using a PtCl2&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction is reported.







Abstract
Polycyclic heteroarenes that contain internal thiophene, furan and pyrrole rings are well&#8208;documented materials due to their presence in fossil fuels and their importance in organic optoelectronic applications. Accordingly, a variety of methods are available for their synthesis. In this report we prepared naphthannulated 4&#8208;membered heteroarene isomers through the PtCl2&#8208;catalyzed 6&#8208;endo cyclization of ethynylbiaryls. Isomers were accessible from two structurally different precursors that contained the ethynyl subunit in different positions. We synthesized two pairs of thiophene&#8208;based ethynylbiaryls where each pair would lead to the same tetracyclic isomer and explored their reactivity in the Pt&#8208;catalyzed transformation. The formation of a detectable amount of inseparable side&#8208;product was observed when the alkyne was introduced onto the benzene ring of the biaryls. This is suggested to be an exo&#8208;methylene group containing derivative that forms via a 5&#8208;exo cyclization pathway. Similarly, naphthannulated benzofuran isomers were prepared following the same strategy and an exo&#8208;methylene&#8208;containing side product was observed when the alkyne unit was on the benzene ring of the biaryl. Finally, novel synthesis methods were described for benzo&#8208;fused carbazoles from ethynylbiaryls containing an alkyne either on the heterocyclic ring or on the phenyl substituent attached to the indole ring. No side&#8208;product formation was detected in this case.

         <title>A Sequential Nitro&#8208;Michael Addition and Reductive Cyclization Cascade Reaction for Diastereoselective Synthesis of Multifunctionalized 3,3&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidinyl&#8208;spirooxindoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and pot economic synthetic strategy has been established for the diastereoselective construction of multifunctionalized 3,3&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidonyl&#8208;spirooxindoles. DFT studies clarified the mechanism of regioselective cascade ring closure, highlighting the preferential reactivity of reduced nitro groups with nitriles, while ester groups remained unreactive.







Abstract
In this investigation, we elucidated, one&#8208;pot two stage efficient synthesis of multifuctionalized spiro[oxindole &#8722;3,3&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidine]. The methodology proceeds via organocatalyzed nitro&#8208;Michael addition reaction between indolylidenecyanoesters and nitroalkanes to formed nitro&#8208;Michael adduct which transformed into multifunctionalized 3,3&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidinyl&#8208;spirooxindoles by metal catalyzed reductive cyclization cascade. DFT investigations were conducted to elucidate the mechanism underlying the preferential reduction of the nitro group, with subsequent attack on the nitrile and ester groups remain inert throughout the reaction process. The approach is operationally simple, easily scalable, exhibits compatibility with readily accessible starting material and catalysts, thereby emphasizing cost&#8208;effectiveness.

The methodology proceeds via organocatalyzed nitro-Michael addition reaction between indolylidenecyanoesters and nitroalkanes to formed nitro-Michael adduct which transformed into multifunctionalized 3,3&#8242;-pyrrolidinyl-spirooxindoles by metal catalyzed reductive cyclization cascade. DFT investigations were conducted to elucidate the mechanism underlying the preferential reduction of the nitro group, with subsequent attack on the nitrile and ester groups remain inert throughout the reaction process. The approach is operationally simple, easily scalable, exhibits compatibility with readily accessible starting material and catalysts, thereby emphasizing cost-effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Advances in Chalcogenation of &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids/Peptides: Synthetic and Mechanistic Aspects</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of the recent advances on the selective C(sp2)&#8208; and C(sp3)&#8722;H chalcogenation of &#945;&#8208;amino acids and peptides using various chalcogenides has been demonstrated. As a result, the evolved methodologies, encompassing transition&#8208;metal, metal&#8208;free, and photocatalytic protocols, exhibit superior efficiency compared to conventional chalcogenation methods.







Abstract
Natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids are building blocks of biomacromolecules proteins and peptides, which are essential for living organisms. Recently, structurally modified amino acids and their peptides have received high demand for the development of various types of biomaterials, including therapeutic drug candidates. For example, the chalcogenated amino acids and their peptides serve as privileged structural scaffolds, derived from native amino acids. Given the widespread utility of sulfur/selenium&#8208;containing compounds in biological, pharmaceutical, and medicinal chemistry, efficient chalcogenation protocol has been accomplished through various catalytic methods such as transition&#8208;metal, metal&#8208;free, and photocatalytic strategies. Among them, transition&#8208;metal based strategies through C&#8722;H activation have been extensively explored for the chalcogenation of amino acids and peptides. Concurrently, metal&#8208;free and photocatalytic strategies offer sustainable and step&#8208;economically viable pathways for achieving successful chalcogenation. In this review, we have focused on the recent achievements of both C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;H chalcogenation of &#945;&#8208;amino acids and peptides with chalcogenides along with their substrate scopes, mechanisms, advantages, and limitations.

         <title>NaI&#8208;promoted Synthesis of Dihydroquinolines via an Unusual Azetine Intermediate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New approaches to improve Skraup&#8208;type reactions for large&#8208;scale synthesis of 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines (1,2&#8208;DHQs) are highly desirable yet challenging in synthetic chemistry. Herein, an efficient sodium iodide&#8208;promoted Skraup&#8208;type reaction of anilines with ketones has been developed at low loading of HBF4 (0.5 mol%), thus providing a sustainable and economical strategy for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;DHQs. A variety of 1,2&#8208;DHQs were obtained in moderate to good isolated yields. The practicality of this strategy was well demonstrated by a hundred&#8208;gram&#8208;scale synthesis of 6&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2,2,4&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydroquinoline in 68% isolated yield. Intriguingly, an unusual azetine intermediate was successfully isolated and structurally determined by NMR and MS, indicating of an unprecedented mechanism for Skraup&#8208;type quinoline synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Substitution pattern of the secondary rim of ICyD ligand influences stereoselectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and evaluation of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;capped cyclodextrin with various protecting groups were conducted. The corresponding gold complexes catalyzed the stereoselective cycloisomerization of enynes. Permethylation of the cyclodextrin&#8217;s hydroxyl groups improved yield and selectivity compared to its benzylated counterpart. Notably, alternating methyl and benzyl groups on the secondary rim of the cyclodextrin further enhanced asymmetry, achieving even higher enantioselectivities. To synthesize this compound, we optimized the selective deprotection of all benzyl groups at the 2&#8208;position of the sugar residues in the cyclodextrin.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A new, simple, catalyst&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free microwave (MW)&#8208;assisted multicomponent method was elaborated for the synthesis of spirooxindole dihydropyridine bisphosphonates as a new family of compounds by the one&#8208;pot reaction of isatins, &#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates and primary amines. The synthesis was carefully optimized in respect of the molar ratio of the starting materials, the heating mode, the temperature, the reaction time and the effect of different catalysts. The substrate scope of the synthesis was also investigated, and the novel title compounds could be prepared in moderate to good yields. A proposed mechanism for the multicomponent reaction was also provided, in which the iminophosphonate compound could mean a key intermediate through the formation of the desired spiro derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>An Electrochemical Method for the Direct Sulfonylation of N&#8208;(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)&#8208;sulfonamides with Sulfonyl Hydrazides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile electrochemical strategy for the synthesis of sulfonylphenol derivatives from N&#8208;(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)&#8208;sulfonamides with sulfonyl hydrazides has been successfully developed. This metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free protocol is suitable for aromatic, heteroaromatic and aliphatic reagents to afford the corresponding sulfonylated products in moderate to high yields under mild conditions. Notably, we successfully scaled up the reaction to gram quantities, underscoring its potential for larger&#8208;scale applications. Furthermore, the synthesized sulfonylphenol derivatives exhibited promising in&#8197;vitro antibacterial activity, highlighting their potential therapeutic relevance.

         <title>Reactions of Unsymmetric Chiral Dialdehydes with Lysine: Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Macrocyclization and Fluorescent Sensing</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The BINOL&#8208;based unsymmetric chiral dialdehydes are discovered to undergo regioselective as well as enantioselective reactions with an unsymmetric chiral diamine, lysine, to generate unsymmetric chiral macrocycles. Addition of Zn2+ can further enhance the selectivity for the macrocycle formation. These compounds are also found to exhibit chemoselective and enantioselective fluorescent recognition of lysine in the presence of Zn2+.







Abstract
Three BINOL&#8208;based unsymmetric chiral dialdehydes, (S)&#8208;4, (S)&#8208;5, and (S)&#8208;6, each containing a salicylaldehyde moiety and an ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208; or para&#8208;substituted benzaldehyde unit, are synthesized and used to react with the enantiomers of an unsymmetric chiral diamine, lysine. These reactions represent the first examples of regioselective as well as enantioselective reactions of an unsymmetric chiral dialdehyde with an unsymmetric chiral diamine to generate unsymmetric chiral macrocycles. The addition of Zn2+ can further enhance the selectivity for the macrocycle formation. Compounds (S)&#8208;4 and (S)&#8208;5 are found to exhibit chemoselective and enantioselective fluorescent recognition of lysine in the presence of Zn2+.

&lt;p&gt;Three BINOL-based unsymmetric chiral dialdehydes, (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;, and (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;, each containing a salicylaldehyde moiety and an &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;- or &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-substituted benzaldehyde unit, are synthesized and used to react with the enantiomers of an unsymmetric chiral diamine, lysine. These reactions represent the first examples of regioselective as well as enantioselective reactions of an unsymmetric chiral dialdehyde with an unsymmetric chiral diamine to generate unsymmetric chiral macrocycles. The addition of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can further enhance the selectivity for the macrocycle formation. Compounds (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; and (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; are found to exhibit chemoselective and enantioselective fluorescent recognition of lysine in the presence of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cerium&#8208;Catalyzed Ritter&#8208;Type C&#8722;H Amination of Alkylarenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photocatalytic strategy for Ritter&#8208;type amination of alkylarenes with nitriles is reported, in which the alkylarene is first brominated by CBr3COOH under Ce(III) catalysis and blue light irradiation, and the resulting bromide then undergoes the normal Ritter reaction to afford the amide product.







Abstract
Reported here is a photocatalytic strategy for Ritter&#8208;type C&#8722;H amination of alkylarenes with nitriles. Under the irradiation of blue light and the catalysis of a simple Ce(III) salt, alkylarenes were brominated by CBr3COOH and thereby channeled to the normal Ritter pathway to afford amide products. A wide range of alkylarenes and nitriles were tolerated, with a few equivalents of a nitrile being feasible.

         <title>Facile Access to Phospholene Fused Polycycles through Intramolecular Alder&#8208;Ene Reaction of Phosphole Sulfides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a facile and straightforward pathway for construction of phosphorus containing polycyclic compounds through Alder&#8208;ene reaction of the 1,n&#8208;enyne moiety. This work also has demonstrated the advance and feasibility of the alkene cyclization strategy in the synthesis of structurally complex benzo&#8208;fused bicyclo[3.3.0] scaffolds and naphtho&#8208;fused bicyclo[4.3.0] skeletons.







Abstract
We have developed a simple, metal&#8208;free annulation of phosphole sulfides through intramolecular Alder&#8208;ene reaction involving a 1,6&#8208;enyne component. This atom&#8208;efficient cyclization pathway provides phospholene fused polycycles with high yields and excellent regioselectivity. The 1,6&#8208;enyne cyclization of phosphole sulfides with a phenyl group affords structurally complex benzo&#8208;fused bicyclo[3.3.0] scaffolds. Meanwhile, phosphole sulfides with a naphthyl group produce naphtho&#8208;fused bicyclo[4.3.0] skeletons, as well as structurally complex [2+2] cycloaddition products.

         <title>Amination of Alkylboronic Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores methods to convert alkylboronic esters into alkyl amines, high value motifs found in bioactive molecules, materials, and catalysts. Three distinct reaction pathways are discussed: amination through 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangements, amination using nucleophilic &#8216;ate&#8217; complexes, and alkyl variants of the Chan&#8208;Lam reaction.







Abstract
Alkylboronic esters are high value chemical building blocks which can be used to make complex, C&#8208;sp3 rich molecules. The ability to convert the C&#8722;B bond in a range of C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions, in addition to their broad functional group compatibility, gives alkylboronic esters significant synthetic utility. Methods to convert boronic esters into amines have particular interest, due to the wide prevalence of nitrogen&#8208;based functional groups in biologically active compounds, functional materials, and catalysts. In this review, we explore different methods for the amination of alkylboronic esters. These can be split into three distinct classes based on the mechanism of reaction: amination through 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangement, amination using nucleophilic &#8216;ate&#8217; complexes, and oxidative amination reactions such as alkyl variants of the Chan&#8208;Lam reaction.

         <title>Dehydrogenative Photoredox Catalyzed Synthesis of Indolyl &#916;2&#8208;Isoxazolines via a Formal C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dehydrogenative photoredox catalyzed formal C(sp3)&#8208;H intramolecular cyclization of indolyl&#8208;oximes to generate indolyl &#916;2&#8208;isoxazolines is reported. In contrast to the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, the reaction avoids the use of super stoichiometric chemical oxidants and high reaction temperatures and is proposed to operate via two sequential single electron oxidation events.

         <title>Electrochemical Alkoxylation of Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free electrochemical method for direct alkoxylation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, producing only hydrogen as a by&#8208;product. This method efficiently functionalizes a wide range of alcohols, enabling the synthesis of celestolide and diphenhydramine derivatives.







Abstract
We report an electrochemical process for the direct alkoxylation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds without the need for external oxidants or metal catalysts. This environmentally friendly and sustainable synthetic strategy facilitates the alkoxylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H in benzylic groups. The approach enables the late&#8208;stage incorporation of complex alkoxy groups into bioactive molecules, providing potential applications in the synthesis of celestolide derivatives.

         <title>Catalytic Transfer Hydrogenation of Dimethyl 1, 4&#8208;cyclohexane Dicarboxylate into 1, 4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol over Cu/ZnO/Al2O3/ZrO2 Catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and efficient catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) protocol is developed for converting dimethyl 1, 4&#8208;cyclohexane dicarboxylate (DMCD) to 1, 4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM). Methanol served as both the hydrogen donor and solvent, while a cost&#8208;effective Cu/ZnO/Al&#8322;O&#8323;/ZrO&#8322; catalyst is employed.

A novel and efficient protocol for the conversion of dimethyl 1, 4&#8208;cyclohexane dicarboxylate (DMCD) into 1, 4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM) was proposed via catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH). In this approach, methanol functioned as both the hydrogen donor and the solvent, and a cost&#8208;effective Cu/ZnO/Al&#8322;O&#8323;/ZrO&#8322; catalyst was utilized for facilitating the reaction. Under the specified conditions at 235&#8201;&#176;C, a conversion of 96.61&#8201;% with a selectivity of 60.71&#8201;% was achieved. To elucidate the reaction mechanism, comprehensive characterizations were conducted to examine the catalysts with varying ZrO2 contents. The investigation revealed that the reaction begins with the adsorption of DMCD and methanol onto the acidic sites of the catalyst, followed by their activation on the reduced&#8208;state Cu.

         <title>Utilizing N&#8208;Hydroxylamine&#8208;Based Active Esters for the Synthesis of Oseltamivir Amide Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxylamine&#8208;derived active esters were synthesized from oseltamivir, which can serve as practical synthetic handles to prepare oseltamivir analogs. Succinimide&#8208;based active ester was the most effective derivative for synthesizing a series of oseltamivir carboxamides.







Abstract
Functionalizing and derivatizing pharmaceuticals are essential for preparing new potentially active compounds. This work shows how active esters derived from oseltamivir carboxylate can be useful synthetic tools for accessing various amide derivatives of oseltamivir. Six hydroxylamine active esters were synthesized directly from oseltamivir carboxylate, and their utility in preparing amide derivatives was evaluated. Succinimide ester 5&#8201;e was the most efficient in terms of its preparation and in synthesizing oseltamivir derivatives.

         <title>Advances in C&#8722;N Bond Formation via N&#8208;Centered Radicals from N&#8208;Aminopyridinium Reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The widespread presence of nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds in natural products and chemical materials, along with their extensive applications in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, has inspired significant efforts to develop new synthetic methods for constructing C&#8722;N bonds. In this regard, Nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals (NCRs) have gained significant attention due to their high reactivity, enabling various useful transformations under mild reaction conditions. In recent years, readily accessible N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts and ylides have emerged as highly promising scaffolds for the generation of N&#8208;centered radicals under photocatalytic conditions. These pyridinium reagents can also serve as bifunctional substrates, providing a variety of useful pyridine&#8208;containing products. This review comprehensively addresses significant advances in C&#8722;N bond construction via N&#8208;centered radicals derived from N&#8208;aminopyridinium substrates, aiming to provide organic chemists with detailed insights to drive further expansion in this field.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals (NCRs) have gained significant attention due to their high reactivity, which facilitates many useful and challenging transformations, particularly in the formation of C&#8722;N bonds. In this regard, N&#8208;aminopridinium reagents are easily accessible substrates that readily generate N&#8208;centered radicals, which can be trapped by arenes, olefins, alkynes and even alkanes under visible light irradiation. In recent years, amination strategies involving N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts have grown remarkably and attracted considerable interest within the synthetic community. This review comprehensively includes all the significant advances in C&#8722;N bond construction via N&#8208;centered radicals derived from N&#8208;aminopyridinium substrates.

         <title>Synthesis of Enantioenriched 2&#8208;((Hetera)cyclo)alkylchromanols and their Spirocyclic Analogs through Enzymatic Resolution</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient approach to the multigram synthesis of 2&#8208;((hetera)cyclo)alkylchromanols and their spirocyclic analogs based on enzymatic resolution is described. It is shown that enzymatic acylation could be used for the preparation of enantioenriched title compounds with primary alkyl substituents at the C&#8208;2 position. Meanwhile, enzymatic hydrolysis of the corresponding acetates was optimal for the preparation of the target alcohols when significant steric hindrance is present, e.g., due to the &#945;&#8208;branching. The latter factor was demonstrated to be crucial for the enzymatic reaction rate in both cases. The synthetic utility of the obtained chiral alcohols was demonstrated through Mitsunobu configuration inversion, as well as by preparation of the corresponding primary amines &#8211; valuable sp3&#8208;enriched building blocks for medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

Chiral nitrogen&#8208;, and phosphorus&#8208;based ligands have been extensively investigated in the asymmetric allylic reactions. However, chiral sulfoxides have not been deemed as a class of practical chiral ligands until last decade, despite several distinct advantages over traditional ligand scaffolds, such as the proximity of the chiral information to the metal center and the ability to switch between S and O coordination. This perspective collects the recent development of chiral sulfoxide ligands for asymmetric allylation since the beginning of 2013. In addition, insights into the future development of this type of promising ligand are discussed.

         <dc:description>
Using a system mediated by iodine(III) and tetrabutylammonium halides, unexpected ring&#8208;contraction rearrangement and halogenation addition reaction of isocoumarins were achieved, resulting in the formation of 3&#8208;substituted phthalides and isochroman&#8208;1&#8208;one derivatives.







Abstract
Iodine(III)&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;contraction rearrangement and halogenated addition reaction have been realized. A series of 3&#8208;substituted phthalides and isochroman&#8208;1&#8208;one derivatives bearing multiple functional groups were obtained in good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. Computational studies indicated that the reaction proceeds via a proton transfer followed by ring opening and ring formation to produce the target product. Moreover, preliminary biological evaluations revealed that both of 3&#8208;substituted phthalides and isochroman&#8208;1&#8208;one derivatives show good antitumor activities.

         <title>Recent Advances in Diphenylmethanone Oxime Reagent Chemistry for Unsaturated Bond Bifunctionalization via Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, the difunctionalization strategy of unsaturated bonds has served as a robust and elegant strategy for ubiquitous motifs in pharmaceuticals and bioactive compounds. Compared with previous research, the application of benzophenone reagents that generate two free radicals under visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated energy transfer conditions can greatly streamline the reaction steps, improving the reaction efficiency and optimizing the reaction conditions. In this short review, the recent advance in developing the bifunctionalization of unsaturated bonds by diphenylmethanone oxime ester reagents is concisely described.







Abstract
The concurrent installation of C&#8722;X (C, O, S, N) and C&#8722;N bonds across unsaturated bond skeletons is an effective strategy for the preparation of ubiquitous motifs in pharmaceuticals and bioactive compounds. In recent years, the rapid development of bifunctionalization reactions has resulted in the emergence of bifunctional reagents as a research hotspot in this field. Among these, diphenylmethanone oxime reagents with highly active N&#8722;O bonds featuring low dissociation energy have significantly advanced the research of bifunctionalization. These reagents possess special features to simultaneously form two chemical bonds or introduce two functional groups, which not only streamlines synthetic pathways but also enhances synthetic efficiency, displaying an excellent atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy. In addition, diphenylmethanone oxime reagents have been extensively employed in organic synthesis, attributed to their ability to facilitate the construction of complex organic structures and to provide innovative reaction pathways. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of various diphenylmethanone oxime reagents and their applications in the bifunctional modification of unsaturated bonds through visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer catalysis (TTEnT).

         <title>Research Progress of Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the advancements of rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H bond activation. We discuss the ongoing challenges of selectivity, particularly in remote (meta/para) C(sp2)&#8722;H bond functionalization, and the reliance on directing groups. Insights from 2018 to 2024 are categorized by reaction type, revealing mechanistic developments that promise enhanced efficiency and broader applications.







Abstract
Over the past decade, rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation reactions have made significant progress and found broad applications in organic synthesis, biomedicine, and materials science. This is primarily attributed to their broad substrate scope, excellent functional group compatibility, and high reactivity. Currently, although considerable progress has been made, rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization still heavily relies on directing groups to achieve selectivity, which significantly diminishes the reaction's efficiency. Additionally, the challenge of selectively functionalizing remote (meta/para) C&#8722;H bonds further complicates research in this field. In this review, we primarily focus on the research progress in rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization from 2018 to 2024, categorizing reactions by type and providing a systematic overview of the mechanistic insights for each.

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Activity of 2,6&#8208;Disubstituted 7&#8208;Deazapurine Ribonucleosides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 2,6&#8208;disubstituted derivatives of 7&#8208;deazapurine ribonucleosides with different combinations of aryl and arylalkynyl substituents were synthesized through regioselective cross&#8208;coupling reactions and tested for biological activity.







Abstract
Several series of 2,6&#8208;disubstituted 7&#8208;deazapurine ribonucleosides were synthesized to investigate their biological activities. The key&#8208;intermediate chloronucleosides were prepared by an anion&#8208;base glycosylation with 2&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;chloro&#8208;7&#8208;deazapurine. The target compounds were obtained by diazotation, either Suzuki and Sonogashira reactions in the case of 2&#8208;arylethynyl&#8208;6&#8208;hetaryl nucleosides or two consecutive Suzuki reactions in the case of 2,6&#8208;diaryl nucleosides. The sequence of diazotation and the first Suzuki reaction is flexible and can be changed depending on the target compounds. Some of the final nucleosides showed moderate cytotoxic activity against several cancer cell lines and low antagonistic activity against a panel of adenosine receptors.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of 4&#8208;Aminotriazoles Through Click Cycloaddition and Generation of Iodonium(III) Triazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for synthesizing 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles was established through sequential click cycloaddition and aminations mediated by triazolyl(Mes)iodonium salts. This method employs a copper&#8208;catalyzed process, characterized by mild conditions, a broad substrate scope, and straightforward operational procedures. The method facilitates the efficient construction of substituted aminotriazoles through both stepwise and one&#8208;pot syntheses. The practical synthesis of triazolyliodonium salts as stable solids is expected to enable further derivatizations.







Abstract
The divergent synthesis of 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles was accomplished through the Cu&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition of organic azides with alkynyliodonium(III) salts, followed by Cu&#8208;catalyzed triazole&#8208;amine coupling involving treatment with amines and amides. The in&#8197;situ formation of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole iodonium salts is crucial to this approach, and the utilization of a Cu&#8208;catalyst facilitates cycloaddition and C&#8722;N bond formation. The synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;triazolyliodonium(III) salts proposed in this study offers advantages, including mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, and operational simplicity, while also providing efficient access to a complex and diverse range of 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole derivatives.

         <title>Synthesis of Vinyl Sulfones from Substituted Alkenes via Molybdooxaziridine Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the MoO2Dipic promoted sulfonation of alkenes using N&#8208;Ts&#8208;hydroxylamine as the quantitative source of Ts. The reaction works with high yields and stereoselectivities for styrenes with a wide variety of substitution patterns. A novel atom transfer radical addition mechanism involving the formation of molybdooxaziridine complex 1 as the active catalyst, difunctionalization with Ts&#8208;NO, followed by oxidation, and then elimination as the rate&#8208;determining&#8208;step for the formation of vinylsulfone 3 has been proposed. Initial kinetic and mechanistic data indicates the formation of Ts&#8208;NO and provides evidence for the proposed mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Quinoid Carbene Mediated C(sp2)&#8208;Heteroatom Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C(sp2)&#8208;heteroatom bonds play a critical role in biologically active molecules, pharmaceuticals, and functional materials. Traditional methods for synthesizing these bonds often rely on transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, such as the Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig and Ullmann reactions, which have limitations, including the requirement for elevated temperature and basic conditions. In recent years, diazo quinones have emerged as promising reagents for C(sp2)&#8208;heteroatom bond formation due to their unique structural and reactive properties, which include high electrophilicity and a tendency toward aromatization. This review highlights recent advances in the use of quinoid carbenes, derived from diazo quinones, for the construction of C(sp2)&#8208;N, C(sp2)&#8208;O, and C(sp2)&#8208;S bonds. Key methodologies discussed include rhodium&#8208;, iridium&#8208;, ruthenium&#8208; and palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, heteroatom&#8208;H bond insertion reactions, migration reactions and sigmatropic rearrangements. These methods offer mild, functional group&#8208;tolerant alternatives to traditional approaches, showcasing their utility in the synthesis of complex bioactive molecules, medicinally relevant compounds, and materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Glycosyl esters as stable donors in chemical glycosylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient glycosylation methods are continuously being developed to obtain homogeneously pure carbohydrates to study their biological roles. The development of effective and stereoselective glycosylations using novel anomeric leaving groups constitutes an active area of research in synthetic carbohydrate chemistry. Although various glycosyl donors have been developed over the decades, anomeric esters as donors in glycosylation have received significant attention in recent times due to their convenience of preparation, shelf stability, catalytic activation, mild conditions, and high glycosylation efficiency. We focus in this mini&#8208;review on covering the glycosyl ester&#8208;containing donors utilized in chemical glycosylation methods, including simple esters, alkenyl, alkynyl&#8208;containing esters, carbonate esters, chelation&#8208;assisted glycosyl esters, allenyl and ynenoate glycosyl esters in glycoside synthesis.</dc:description>

Abstract
A novel Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] annulation of N&#8208;hydroxyoximes with maleate esters/2&#8208;chloroacrylates is disclosed, in which diverse isoquinoline skeleton compounds were generated in moderate to excellent yields. The protocol exhibits a good compatibility of functional groups and wide scope of substrates without using any external metal oxidants. Gram&#8208;scale and derivatization reactions were performed to show the potential utility of this transformation.

         <title>Photochemical&#8208;, Electrochemical&#8208;, and Photoelectrochemical&#8208; Catalyzed Hydrogen Atom Transfer from Aldehydes to Acyl Radicals and Their Transformations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical&#8208;, electrochemical&#8208;, and photoelectrochemical&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from aldehydes to acyl radicals and their transformations are presented with mechanistic insights. This review focuses on recent advances, showcasing the potential and delivering different modes of reactivity of acyl radicals as well as future perspectives of this field.







Abstract
Acyl radical has assumed an eminent position in the synthetic chemistry due to its unique and often highly reactivity. Using aldehyde as acyl radical source does not require the prefunctionalization of substrate. Furthermore, the formation of acyl radical can be achieved through a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process. In recent years, photochemical&#8208;, electrochemical&#8208;, and photoelectrochemical&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular HAT from aldehydes have been regarded as mild and sustainable routes to acyl radicals. Herein, we discuss the important advancements in the past 6&#8197;years in photo&#8208;, electro&#8208;, and photoelectro&#8208;catalyzed generation of acyl radicals from aldehydes and their applications in organic synthesis. We also highlight the mechanistic insights that have emerged from these transformations.

         <title>Case studies of dimensionality in chemical data</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ambition to relate intrinsic features of chemical data to the underlying chemical reaction networks (CRNs) is not new, but has experienced only modest success. This may partly be attributed to a lack of theoretical groundwork connecting idealized theory to actual experimental data with added complexity. In particular: i) many CRNs have species that cannot be directly observed experimentally; ii) the apparent number of underlying reactions is a function of the resolution of the data; iii) chemical phenomena can change the number of discernable independent processes of the data. In this work, we illustrate the application of the recently introduced concept of data dimension, which quantifies the linearly independent dimensions the system composition in a CRN can change. We perform case studies inspecting the dimensionality of chemical data characterizing CRNs, and outline how it can be used for mechanistic interpretation. In some instances, these extended considerations allow us to directly recover the CRN proposed in the literature without any fitting. This demonstrates that, with incomplete information, important clues about CRN structure can still be recovered. Additionally, our approach detects critical subtleties, preventing important candidate reactions from being discarded in mechanistic studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Assisted Regioselective C3&#8208;H Chalcogenation of 4&#8208;Phenyl Aminocoumarin: Access to Unusual Dual Selenylation of N&#8208;Substituted Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward metal and photocatalyst&#8208;free iodine&#8208;dependent green protocol of chalcogenation of 4&#8208;phenyl aminocoumarin/4&#8208;phenylamino&#8208;2&#8208;pyrone, as well as abnormal dual selenylation of N&#8208; substituted&#8208;4&#8208;phenyl aminocoumarin, has been developed at room temperature and ambient air in green solvent PEG&#8208;400.







Abstract
A simple, efficient, metal and photocatalyst&#8208;free, eco&#8208;friendly approach for the C3&#8208;H regioselective chalcogenation of 4&#8208;phenyl aminocoumarin, as well as abnormal dual selenylation of N&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;phenyl aminocoumarin, has been developed by using diphenyl dichalcogenides and iodine as support in green solvent PEG&#8208;400 under ambient temperature and aerobic condition. Furthermore, chalcogenation of 4&#8208;phenyl amino&#8208;2&#8208;pyrone has also been accomplished in similar conditions. The proposed mechanism is based on the control experiments and suggests an ionic pathway. The reaction offers a green synthetic path with a high yield, and the methodology is crucially significant due to its operational simplicity, convenient execution, scalability, and tolerance of various functional groups.

         <title>Unraveling Phenanthrenoid Dimerization in Juncus acutus: A DFT&#8208;guided Exploration of Radical&#8208;Coupling Reaction Mechanisms</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Juncus acutus&#160;is a plant found near ponds and brackish marshes, producing secondary metabolites like phenanthrenoid dimers with antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti&#8208;inflammatory activities. Despite this, little is known about the detailed mechanisms behind their dimerization reactions. In this study, we used Density Functional Theory to explore the reaction mechanisms of phenanthrene and dihydrophenanthrene species in radical coupling, both in gas&#8208;phase and solution. The dimerization reactions, initiated by the OH radical, result in the formation of two phenanthrenoid dimers (homodimer and heterodimer). The OH radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from the hydroxyl group, leading to the formation of radicals and water. Our analysis of electronic spin density highlighted the preferred reactive sites that drive regioselective dimer formation. Furthermore, the study identifies a triplet &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#160;stacked intermediate preceding the diketone formation on the singlet potential energy surface, revealing a two&#8208;state reactivity mechanism. The diketone dimers are then converted via a water&#8208;mediated keto&#8208;enol tautomerization into their dienolic forms, completing the reaction pathway. This work offers insights into the complex dimerization processes of phenanthrenoids in nature, using computational methods to shed light on poorly understood molecular mechanisms in plant organisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective synthesis of cyclic dithiocarbonates using bis&#8208;benzimidazolate salts as multifunctional catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic dithiocarbonates of the type 1,3&#8208;oxathiolane&#8208;2&#8208;thione were selectively and efficiently produced from the reaction between epoxides and CS2 using disodium bis&#8208;benzimidazolate salts &#160;as catalysts. We have designed and synthesized three nucleophilic catalysts from the neutral forms of bis&#8208;benzimidazole compounds (BBE&#8208;Me, BBE&#8208;H and BBE&#8208;NO2), through simple procedures. All three catalysts, with aryl substituents possessing different electronic characteristics, were able to selectively catalyze the production of cyclic dithiocarbonates. BBE&#8208;Me proved to be the most effective catalyst in the initial screening with 1,2&#8208;epoxy&#8208;3&#8208;phenoxypropane, converting 95% of the epoxide with 99% of selectivity for the cyclic dithiocarbonate 1,3&#8208;oxathiolane&#8208;2&#8208;thione. This catalyst was subsequently used to evaluate various reaction parameters and then several epoxides were selectively converted to the respective cyclic dithiocarbonates, under mild conditions, with a low catalyst loading, short reaction times, and in a solvent&#8208; and additive&#8208;free system. A mechanistic proposal, supported by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, demonstrated for the first time that a nucleophilic catalyst in this system can simultaneously activate both CS2 and the epoxide molecule.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient approach to the multigram synthesis of 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes is described. The method relied on the intramolecular imide formation in the properly 1,3&#8208;functionalized cyclobutane derivative. In turn, the latter compound was obtained via the diastereoselective Strecker reaction of readily accessible 3&#8208;oxo&#173;cyclobutanecarboxylate.

For allylic monofluorides, high enantioselectivities were achieved, even for fluorinated tertiary carbons, with expanded substitution patterns on vinylic moieties enabling precise control over di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetrasubstituted fluorides. Advances in defluorofunctionalization and direct C&#8211;H fluorination have addressed the limitations of raw materials and made these species more accessible. Additionally, considerable progress has been achieved in the related photoredox reactions, and electrochemistry has emerged as a valuable tool for allylic fluoride synthesis. This review summarizes the recent advances in the synthesis of allylic fluorides, focusing on transition metal catalysis, organocatalysis, and noncatalytic methodologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Multisubstituted Allenes via Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of Propargylic Acetates with Chlorohydrosilanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reductive cross&#8208;coupling of propargylic acetates and chlorohydrosilanes using nickel catalysts has been reported to produce a series of silyl&#8208;substituted allenes with high regioselectivity.







Abstract
This paper introduces an innovative strategy for the synthesis of multisubstituted allenes via nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The approach utilizes propargyl acetates and chlorosilanes to produce a variety of silyl&#8208;substituted allenes. The reaction conditions are notably mild, and the process is characterized by high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, as well as an impressive substrate scope. Furthermore, the method can be readily extended to the use of chlorogermane and chlorostannane, facilitating the synthesis of germanium or stannium&#8208;substituted allenes. This research not only offers a valuable strategy for the preparation of multisubstituted allenes but also significantly broadens the synthetic repertoire for the construction of highly functionalized molecules.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Induced Amplification of Chiral Superstructures of Carbazole Porphyrins in Dynamic Supramolecular Aggregates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we investigated supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of carbazole porphyrins in mixture of chloroform and methanol. In chloroform, porphyrins assembled into micro&#8208;belt superstructures, however, 90&#8201;% MeOH in chloroform resulted chiral helical microfibres of 1 and twisted helical ribbons of 2, respectively. The chiral superstructures utilizing the fundamental self&#8208;assembly principle, in which one directional growth of chiral superstructures is due to &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of core of porphyrin along with hydrophobic interaction of the ethyl hexyl chain.







Abstract
Herein, we reported design, synthesis and investigation for supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of two types of carbazole porphyrins one with free base carbazole porphyrin (codes as 1), and second one zinc (II) metalated carbazole porphyrin (codes as 2) in the various ratios of chloroform (CHCl3, non&#8208;polar) and methanol (MeOH, polar) mixed solvent. Typically, in only chloroform both 1 and 2 produce micro&#8208;belt like structures, while increasing polar solvents i.&#8201;e. 90&#8201;% MeOH in CHCl3 (v/v, 9&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio), 1 resulted as helical microfibres, however, 2 assembled into twisted helical ribbons, respectively. The solution based solvophobic effect on self&#8208;assembly demonstrated by using circular dichroism (CD), UV&#8208;Vis and emission spectroscopy. Furthermore, X&#8208;ray diffraction was used to confirm amorphous nature of assembly and DFT for computational study used to find energy band gap between carbazole and porphyrin. Importantly, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was employed to visualise chiral supramolecular superstructures of 1 and 2, respectively. It is clear that growth of chiral superstructures is due to &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of porphyrin core along with hydrophobic interaction of the ethyl hexyl chain. Thus, it is clear that adjusting the ratio of polar to non&#8208;polar solvent, hydrophobic carbazole porphyrins confirmed formation of chiral superstructures.

         <title>&#946;&#8208;halovinyl Aldehydes: Multifaceted Versatile Building Blocks In Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vilsmeier&#8208;Haack reaction is an important tool to synthesize &#946;&#8208;halovinyl aldehyde which is a ptential aldo&#8208;x bifunctional building block (AXB3). Multiple reactive sites and high reactivity of formyl group and vinylic/benzylic halogen makes them fast reacting electrophiles offering fertile land for diverse organic transformations. In this review, we have assembled all the contributions from mid&#8208;2007 to Jan 2024.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;halovinyl aldehydes serve as a valuable building blocks in organic synthesis. These aldo&#8208;x bifunctional building blocks (AXB3s) contain a alkenic double bond (vinyl) as well as a formyl group along with a halogen atom (Cl, Br, I) bonded with the &#946;&#8208;carbon atom of vinyl aldehyde. Owing to the presence of these multiple reactive sites, &#946;&#8208;halovinyl aldehydes act as a suitable precursor for Michael addition, direct addition, addition&#8208;elimination reactions, cross&#8208;coupling reactions, condensation reactions, nucleophilic substitution reactions, domino reactions, MCRs, Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, functional group transformation reactions and enantioselective transformations. Therefore, a comprehensive review on synthetic exploration of &#946;&#8208;halovinyl aldehydes has been carried out for the generation of reactive intermediates and diverse bioactive heterocycles by using various C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;S and C&#8722;O bond forming reactions. In this review, we have assembled the literature from mid&#8208;2007 to Jan 2024.

         <title>Stereo&#8208; and Chemoselective Enrichment of sp3 Character in Post&#8208;Ugi Morpholines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive study aimed at reducing the degree of unsaturation and consequently increasing the sp3 character in post&#8208;Ugi morpholines is conducted. The scaffold assembly involves triphenylphosphine&#8208;promoted umpolung oxa&#8208;Michael cyclization of Ugi adducts derived from propiolic acid and glycolaldehyde dimer. Diastereoselective heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation, combined with chemoselective amide reduction, enables the controlled modulation of the morpholine core&#8216;s rigidity.







Abstract
We conducted a systematic study on synthesis and modification of morpholine core using Ugi adducts derived from propiolic acid and glycolaldehyde dimer. The assembly step involved triphenylphosphine&#8208;promoted 6&#8208;exo&#8208;dig umpolung oxa&#8208;Michael cyclization of Ugi&#8208;derived hydroxypropargylamides yielding 2&#8208;methylenemorpholin&#8208;3&#8208;one derivatives. Subsequent heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of the exocyclic double bond proceeded in a highly diastereoselective fashion establishing a relative cis configuration in the resulting sp3&#8208;enriched morpholinone scaffold. Finally, chemoselective amide reduction with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) allowed to obtain fully saturated morpholines while leaving the more sterically hindered exocyclic amide moiety intact. Taken together these findings outline the strategy for controlled reduction of the inherent rigidity of post&#8208;Ugi scaffolds.

&lt;p&gt;We conducted a systematic study on synthesis and modification of morpholine core using Ugi adducts derived from propiolic acid and glycolaldehyde dimer.

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative Hydroxychalcogenation of Olefins with Disulfides/Thiols/Diselenides and H2O as Nucleophilic Oxygen Sources</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study details a novel electrochemical approach for the oxychalcogenation of olefins, employing disulfides, thiols, or diselenides as chalcogen sources and water as the nucleophilic oxygen source.







Abstract
A direct electrochemical redox reaction of olefins and disulfides/thiols/diselenides without external oxidants has been developed, which includes the hydroxychalcogenation of olefins. This procedure exhibited good functional group tolerance, and a series of &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfide/&#946;&#8208;hydroxyselenide derivatives were obtained in moderate to good yields. Mechanistic studies and cyclic voltammetry were also conducted to elucidate the reaction process.

         <title>Magnetite: a Green, Sustainable and Recyclable Catalyst for Direct Synthesis of Thioesters by C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A green and sustainable approach to the direct synthesis of thioesters has been developed using Fe3O4 as a low&#8208;cost, easily prepared, reusable and environmentally safe catalyst. The cross dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) of various thiols and aldehydes in water, or even in the absence of solvent, using tert&#8208;butylhydroperoxide as oxidant, under ligand and base&#8208;free mild conditions, afforded the corresponding thioesters in good to excellent yields. This simple protocol features broad substrate scope, good compatibility with different functional groups, as well as high atom&#8208;efficiency. The scalability, ease of (magnetic) recovery and reuse of the magnetite catalyst are additional eco&#8208;friendly attributes of this methodology. Moreover, the broad synthetic applications of thioesters further highlight the potential utility of the present protocol.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;component radical relay reaction of 1&#8208;acryloyl&#8208;2&#8208;cyanoindoles with 4&#8208;alkyl Hantzsch esters and Na2S2O5 to access alkylsulfonyl pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoledione derivatives has been developed.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component alkylsulfonylation/cyclization/hydrolysis relay reaction of 1&#8208;acryloyl&#8208;2&#8208;cyanoindoles with 4&#8208;alkyl Hantzsch esters and Na2S2O5 involving sulfur dioxide insertion has been established to access a series of alkylsulfonyl pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indolediones derivatives. With this method, a variety of primary and secondary alkyl radicals can be used for trapping sulfur dioxide and the corresponding alkylsulfonyl radical intermediates formed in&#8197;situ, followed by alkyl sulfonyl radical addition, cyclization and hydrolysis. This reaction involves selective cleavage of a carbon&#8208;carbon bond followed by successive formation of three new chemical bonds, in which the cyano group has dual roles as a radical acceptor and a carbonyl source.

Using mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (mpg&#8208;C3N4) as a metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photocatalyst was developed for thiocyanation of alkenes under visible light irradiation with oxygen as green oxidant and without any other additives. The present protocol has excellent functional group tolerance and the desired tetrasubstituted alkenyl thiocyanides were obtained in moderate to good yields. Moreover, the recyclable mpg&#8208;C3N4 catalyst could be used at least 6&#8197;times without significant loss of activities.

         <title>On the Halogenation of Tyrosine N&#8208;Oxime Methyl Ester</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building blocks derived from tyrosine N&#8208;oxime have been used to construct natural products. We report the synthesis of nine halogenated tyrosine N&#8208;oxime derivatives reminiscent of biosynthetic precursors. Full conversion was ensured by the addition of p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (p&#8208;TsOH) for monohalogenation and a key oxidation&#8208;reduction sequence using excess N&#8208;bromo, N&#8208;chloro, or N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NBS, NCS, NIS) to provide dihalogenated derivatives.







Abstract
Efficient syntheses of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and heterodihalogenated derivatives of tyrosine N&#8208;oxime methyl ester are reported. Monohalogenation with N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS), N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide (NCS) or N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS) was optimized by addition of acid to suppress dihalogenation, affording bromo, chloro, and iodo derivatives in 71&#8201;%, 50&#8211;53&#8201;%, and 78&#8211;80&#8201;% yields, respectively. Homodihalogenation utilized a two&#8208;step, one&#8208;flask process via a spirocyclic intermediate, yielding dibromo, dichloro, and diiodo analogues, respectively (75&#8211;76&#8201;%, 54&#8211;56&#8201;%, 79&#8211;80&#8201;%). This strategy was extended to synthesize hetero&#8208;dihalogenated bromochloro, bromoiodo, and chloroiodo derivatives from monohalogenated analogues (50&#8211;77&#8201;%). Key to this approach was the formation of an oxidized spirocyclic intermediate using excess N&#8208;halosuccinimide, followed by Na&#8322;S&#8322;O&#8324; reduction. This method ensures complete conversion and simplifies purification. Nine halogenated building blocks were prepared. These methods provide practical access to versatile precursors for natural product synthesis and derivatization, offering potential for diverse synthetic applications including regioselective palladium&#8208;catalyzed couplings.

         <title>Benzoisoxazoles as Privileged Scaffolds in the Design and Synthesis of N&#8208;containing Molecules: A Recent Update</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exponential increase in the use of benzoisoxazoles as cycloaddition partners and amination reagents for the synthesis of highly valuable nitrogen&#8208;containing molecular scaffolds, particularly N&#8208;heterocycles, has garnered considerable attention. This review summarizes key advances from 2015 to 2024 in transformations of 2,1&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;benzoisoxazoles, with a focus on mechanisms, catalyst selectivity, and synthetic scope, while also addressing current challenges and future prospects.







Abstract
Benzoisoxazoles, with a distinctive 10&#8208;&#960;&#8208;electron system and significant polarity, readily trigger N&#8722;O bond cleavage, enabling multifaceted applications in organic synthesis. Over the past decade, the exponentially increased use of benzoisoxazoles towards the synthesis of highly valuable N&#8208;containing scaffolds, especially N&#8208;heterocycles, has garnered substantial attention. In this review, we summarize recent developments in the transformation of 2,1&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;benzoisoxazoles since 2015, highlighting the neglected resemblances of these two nitroxy heterocycles. Key processes in the assorted reactions of benzoisoxazoles, including mechanisms, scope, catalyst&#8208;controlled chemodivergence, current limitations, and developmental prospects, are also introduced and discussed.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Hydroxylation of Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, substantial progress has been achieved in the synthesis of hydroxylated compounds from boronic acids. This review summarizes the representative methods over the past decade. The paper categorizes these methods based on the types of catalysts employed, encompassing a range of metal catalysts and non&#8208;metal catalysts, as well as other reaction types of catalyst&#8208;free.







Abstract
Hydroxylated compounds represent a significant and diverse class of substances in the field of chemistry. These compounds play critical roles in various chemical reactions and are essential components in numerous industrial applications. Recent years have witnessed remarkable advancements in the synthesis of hydroxylated compounds, especially those derived from boronic acids. The synthesis of hydroxylated compounds from boronic acids typically involves the utilization of various types of catalysts, which are essential for enhancing reaction rates and selectivity, including metal catalysts such as CuFe&#8322;O&#8324;, Cu@C&#8323;N&#8324;, AgNPs, and Ti0.97Ni0.3O1.97, as well as non&#8208;metal catalysts like polycaprolactone (PCL), TFB&#8208;BMTH COF materials, C70, and graphene oxide (GO). These catalytic reactions often require the addition of oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide (H&#8322;O&#8322;) or molecular oxygen, which serve as critical reagents in the hydroxylation process. In certain cases, organic bases act as electron donors to propel the reaction. Furthermore, some studies have reported oxidative hydroxylation reactions that are catalyst&#8208;free.This review aims to summarize the recent advancements and breakthroughs in the synthesis of hydroxylated compounds from boronic acids, with a particular focus on research conducted from 2014 to 2024.

         <title>Photoinduced Gem&#8208;Difluoroallylic Ketones Formation via Selective Carbonyl &#8211; C(sp3) Bond Cleavage of &#946;&#8208;Ketone Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and efficient method for constructing gem&#8208;difluoroallylic ketones via photo&#8208;induced selective carbonyl&#8722;C(sp3) bond cleavage of &#946;&#8208;ketone alcohols is reported. This method maintains excellent functional group tolerance and the resulting products can be readily transformed into other valuable chemical molecules. Moreover, mechanism studies indicate that this reaction initiates with a C&#8722;C bond &#946;&#8208;scission, generating carbon radicals through a PCET event.







Abstract
A photoinduced reaction for the formation of gem&#8208;difluoroallylic ketones via selective &#946;&#8208;scission of &#946;&#8208;ketone alcohols with &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes is described. This process demonstrates a broad substrate scope for both &#946;&#8208;ketone alcohols and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes. The reaction is proposed to proceed via an intramolecular PCET mechanism. The core of the strategy involves the oxidative cleavage of the carbonyl &#8211; C(sp3) bond in &#946;&#8208;ketone alcohols, facilitated by a base, to release acyl radicals, followed by the rapid addition of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes. Additionally, various downstream transformations were carried out with these compounds in a one&#8208;step operation. This protocol is also applicable to corresponding alkynylation and Minisci reactions.

This protocol is also applicable to corresponding alkynylation and Minisci reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>S&#8208;Nucleophilic Imidazoline Ring Expansion: a Novel Approach to the Formation of Medium&#8208;Sized Thiolactames</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the formation of medium&#8208;sized heterocycles with a thioamide moiety has been developed. This is based on the expansion reaction of the imidazole ring under the action of an S&#8208;nucleophile.







Abstract
A novel method has been successfully developed for the synthesis of medium&#8208;sized heterocycles containing thioamide groups. This approach facilitates the expansion of the imidazoline moiety within the condensed ring system through the action of S&#8208;nucleophiles, enabling access to a broader and more diverse chemical space for natural product analogs and bioactive compounds. A series of [1,4,7]thia&#8208;(oxa&#8722;)diazecin&#8208;9&#8208;thiones were efficiently synthesized from diarene&#8208;fused [1.4]heteroazepines using this transformation, achieving yields ranging from 28&#8211;58&#8201;%.

         <dc:description>Starting materials for sustainable total synthesis often come from the chiral pool: carbohydrates, cyclitols, amino acids, and terpenes. In the terpene family, (&#8211;)&#8208;sclareol has served as a sustainable, readily available, and versatile chiral building block for the synthesis of numerous natural products. (&#8211;)&#8208;Sclareol possesses a unique structure that has consequently promoted its integration as a core framework within various structurally complex and biologically active substances, including sesquiterpenoids, diterpenoids, and sesterterpenoids.

         <title>Alkyne&#8208; and Azide&#8208;Functionalised Cyclophellitol Derivatives for Selective Glucuronidase Targeting</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epoxide and azidiride&#8208;functionalized sugar carbocycles can be powerful mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors, but can also be difficult to tune for specificity. We present here the synthesis of three glucuronic acid configured carbocycles functionalized with azides in place of oxygen 4 or alkynes on the aziridine, with the eventual aim of growing selectivity for heparanase.







Abstract
Heparanase is an endo&#8208;acting &#946;&#8208;glucuronidase responsible for the degradation of heparan sulfate structures in the extracellular matrix. The enzyme is found to be significantly upregulated in aggressive cancer types, aiding cell proliferation by liberation of growth factors, increasing angiogenesis and metastasis. Despite much interest in the development of inhibitors to control this activity, no compound targeting heparanase has yet been approved as a drug. While mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors derived from the natural product cyclophellitol are very potent enzyme inactivators through their reactive epoxide, one challenge in their development is in achieving selectivity for heparanase over related glycosidases while also maintaining a balance of appropriate pharmacological properties. We present here the synthesis of three cyclophellitol scaffolds presenting azide and alkyne handles at key positions, which are amenable to facile elaboration via copper&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions to aid in exploring the structure&#8208;activity relationship for selective inhibitors of heparanase.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Characterization of BODIPY based 1H&#8208;Tetrazole Ligands</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fluorescence active ligand system consisting of a BODIPY derivative, linked to a 1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl coordinating moiety via alkyl or benzyl spacers, is presented. The designed ligands exhibit remarkable emission properties even in solid state, which is complemented by crystal structure analysis. This enables future application of the ligands in various fields of coordination chemistry including spin&#8208;crossover photoluminescence coupled systems.







Abstract
Four novel fluorescence active ligands (1&#8211;4) consisting of a 1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl moiety as coordinating unit and a 4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene (BODIPY) derivative as fluorophore, bridged via alkyl (&#8208;(CH2)n&#8208;, n=1&#8211;3) or benzyl (&#8208;CH2&#8208;C6H4&#8208;) spacers were designed. Successful synthesis is demonstrated by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, as well as powder and single crystal XRD analysis. The methylene bridged ligand 2 (4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3,5,7&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;8&#8208;[(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methyl]&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene) crystallizes in different polymorphs and solvatomorphs, in contrast to the other three ligands, which show no polymorphism under identical conditions. Photophysical studies revealed high fluorescence quantum yields (69 &#8211; 95&#8201;%) in solution for the &#8208;(CH2)2&#8208; bridged ligand 3 (4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3,5,7&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;8&#8208;[(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethyl]&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene) and the &#8208;(CH2)3&#8208; bridged ligand 4 (4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3,5,7&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;8&#8208;[(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)propyl]&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene). Non&#8208;radiative decay due to rotational motion of the 1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208; and/or &#8208;CH2&#8208;C6H4&#8208; moiety for 2 and 1 (4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3,5,7&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;8&#8208;[4&#8208;((1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methyl)phenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene) respectively leads to reduced quantum yields of &#8805;35&#8201;%. Complete fluorescence quenching upon aggregation is prevented by installation of the sterically demanding 1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl moiety and a spacer in meso&#8208;position of the BODIPY core to elongate the intermolecular distances between two adjacent BODIPY cores. Detailed photophysical and crystallographic investigations are supported by theoretical calculations.

         <title>1,4&#8208;Dioxane as Precursor of &#8722;CH2CH2&#8722;: A Simple and Convenient Strategy to Synthesize 1,2&#8208;Disulfide Substituted Ethanes Initiated by Iodine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel precursor of &#8722;CH2CH2&#8722; has been achieved via the double C&#8722;O cleavage of 1,4&#8208;dioxane under the proton acid condition of HI. Control experiments suggest that 1,2&#8208;diiodoethane generated in&#8208;situ is crucial for the formation of the product. This protocol for the construction of various 1,2&#8208;disulfide substituted ethanes is very convenient and practical by its simple and mild conditions.







Abstract
An unprecedented I2&#8208;initiated nucleophilic ring opening reaction of 1,4&#8208;dioxane with thiols for the construction of various 1,2&#8208;disulfide substituted ethanes has been developed. Previously, dihalogenated ethane, acetylene or ethylene are often used as the pre&#8208;cursor of &#8722;CH2CH2&#8722;. Through the cleavage of two C&#8722;O bonds, 1,4&#8208;dioxane as precursor of &#8722;CH2CH2&#8722; has been achieved for the first time. In the presence of HI, thiols could be replaced by disulfides as nucleophile. This protocol is very convenient and practical by its simple and mild conditions.

&lt;p&gt;A novel precursor of &#8722;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722; has been achieved &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; the double C&#8722;O cleavage of 1,4-dioxane under the proton acid condition of HI. Control experiments suggest that 1,2-diiodoethane generated in-situ is crucial for the formation of the product. This protocol for the construction of various 1,2-disulfide substituted ethanes is very convenient and practical by its simple and mild conditions.

         <title>Application of Laser&#8208;Generated Au&#8208;Ag/Al2O3 Nanoparticle Catalysts for the Selective Catalytic Oxidation of 5&#8208;(Hydroxymethyl) Furfural to 2,5&#8208;Furan&#8208;Dicarboxylic Acid</title>

With reference to the sustainability and green synthesis towards biomass valorization, we report highly active and selective oxidation of the renewable feedstock HMF (78&#8201;% conversion) into the commercially important chemical FDCA (80&#8201;% selectivity) by implying specially designed and synthesized bimetallic AuAg nanoparticle catalysts supported on Al2O3 by laser ablation under mild basic conditions.







Abstract
Conversion of lignocellulosic biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;(Hydroxymethyl) furfural (HMF) into 2,5&#8208;Furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) has a high potential to replace petroleum&#8208;based feedstocks for the production of plastics. In this study, a green synthesis strategy for the selective oxidation of HMF to FDCA is reported by using laser&#8208;generated and specifically designed bimetallic AuAg nanoparticle catalysts supported on Al2O3 using molecular oxygen as oxidant and water as a solvent. Although supported AuAg catalysts are already known as suitable catalysts for this reaction, the optimal reaction conditions (type of base, reaction temperature, oxygen pressure), Au&#8201;:&#8201;Ag composition, role of metal&#8208;support effects and origin of the active site still remain under debate. Interestingly, an Au9Ag1/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited the highest activity with a FDCA yield of up to 66&#8201;% at 80&#8201;% HMF conversion. Hereby, NaHCO3 (instead of NaOH) as a smoother base in 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 base:HMF ratio, low oxygen pressures of 5&#8197;bar, and a mild temperature of 150&#8201;&#176;C were found optimal. The yield remained fairly stable on reuse of the catalyst for 3 cycles without hints of catalyst sintering or leaching. The titration of surficial hydroxyls on the AuxAgy/Al2O3 surface showed the highest density of acidic hydroxyls for the most active Au9Ag1/Al2O3 catalyst. The respective hydroxyls potentially originate from metal&#8208;support interactions between the AuAg nanoparticles with the alumina support and act as Lewis acidic sites that oxidize the alcohol moiety of HMF to form FDCA with high selectively. In summary, this study shows that the catalytic activity of AuAg catalysts in HMF oxidation is not just linked to an alloying effect but also to a metal&#8208;support effect where the AuAg nanoparticles appear to directly affect the local acidity of the support.

         <title>Photolabile ortho&#8208;Nitro&#8208;Benzyl Carbonate as an Amino Protecting Group for Stereocontrolled Synthesis of 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;2&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;Glycosides</title>

The photolabile ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl carbonate (oNBC) was described as an amino protecting group for stereocontrolled synthesis of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glycosides. Under irradiation at 365&#8197;nm, deprotection of the multiple O&#8208; and N&#8208;oNBC protecting groups of glycosides was effectively achieved with aminomethyl polystyrene (P&#8208;CH2NH2) as the carbonyl scavenger.







Abstract
Traditional amino protecting groups are often removed under harsh conditions or incompatible with other protecting groups, rendering the synthesis of complex 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glycosides difficult. Here, we utilize the photolabile ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl carbonate (oNBC) as an amino protecting group for stereocontrolled synthesis of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glycosides. The gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation with per&#8208;O&#8208;oNBC&#8208;protected 2&#8208;N&#8208;phthaloyl (Phth)&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;, 2&#8208;N&#8208;trichloroacetyl (TCA)&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;, and 2&#8208;N&#8208;oNBC&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;glycosyl ynenoates proceeded smoothly to provide 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy glycosides with exclusive &#946;&#8208;selectivities via the neighboring group participation (NGP) effect. Removal of the multiple O&#8208; and N&#8208;oNBC protecting groups of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy glycosides was achieved under irradiation at 365&#8197;nm with aminomethyl polystyrene as the carbonyl scavenger.
