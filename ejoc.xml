         <dc:description>Scalable protocols of straightforward synthesis of enantiomeric &#947;&#8208;(acyloxy)carboxylic acids and &#947;&#8208;lactones are presented. The key step is lipase&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective acylation of &#947;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acid sodium salt in organic solvent followed by acidification of the product, extraction and acidic relactonization of the unreacted enantiomer. The mixture of &#947;&#8208;(acyloxy)carboxylic acid and &#947;&#8208;lactone is separated either by extraction with solution of sodium bicarbonate or by distillation. A switch of enantioinduction of Candida antarctica lipase B along homologous nucleophiles from R configuration of &#947;&#8208;hydroxyhexanoic acid salt to S configuration of the C7 and longer&#8208;chain homologues has been disclosed.

         <title>Iodine(III)&#8208;Mediated Free&#8208;Aniline Iodination through Acetyl Hypoiodite Formation: Study of the Reaction Pathway</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 45, December 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first iodine(III)&#8208;mediated para&#8208;selective iodination of free anilines through the in&#8197;situ formed acetyl hypoiodite as halogenating species is described. This procedure allows a cheap, efficient, and easy way to get acetyl hypoiodite in less than 2 minutes by combining PIDA and NH4I. Experimental and theoretical calculations supported the mechanism that proceeds under mild conditions.







Abstract
The first iodine(III)&#8208;mediated para&#8208;selective iodination protocol for free anilines as well as the mechanistic elucidation of the reaction pathway is described. The developed method proceeded under clean, non&#8208;toxic, efficient, and in general mild reaction conditions. To the best of our knowledge this report describes for the first time a procedure focused specifically on the introduction of an iodine atom in free anilines using PIDA [(diacetoxyiodo)benzene] and ammonium iodide which formed in&#8197;situ acetyl hypoiodite (AcO&#8208;I) as the halogenating species. Our DFT calculations suggest a reaction mechanism that highlights the catalytic role of the ammonium cation in the AcO&#8208;I formation and halogenation. Considering there are few procedures for the iodine atom introduction in anilines using non&#8208;acidic conditions, herein we described an initial report on a mild and operationally simple alternative using iodine(III) reagents.

         <title>Nintedanib&#8208;&#945;V&#946;3 Integrin Ligand Dual&#8208;Targeting Conjugates towards Precision Treatment of Melanoma</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 45, December 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and the in&#8208;cell biological evaluation of three new drug&#8208;integrin ligand covalent conjugates were performed to provide intelligent vectorization of the clinically approved drug nintedanib towards human melanoma cells, and to guarantee the biological action of the constituting units towards their respective receptor targets.







Abstract
Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, and more than 150,000 cases are diagnosed every year in Europe. New strategies in treatment approved over the past decade, such as immunotherapy and targeted therapy, have prolonged life expectation even in stage&#8197;IV melanoma patients. However, due to the increasing incidence of this cancer, the development of new therapeutic strategies remains urgent. Recent studies revealed the combination of nintedanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved as an antifibrotic drug, and immuno&#8208; and/or targeted therapy drugs to be promising. Here we present three new dual covalent conjugates, in which a nintedanib unit is permanently linked to a cyclopeptidomimetic ligand for the &#945;V&#946;3 integrin, a transmembrane receptor involved in cell survival, proliferation and migration, which is overexpressed by tumour cells, and therefore recognized as marker for tumour targeting. In vitro assays on human melanoma tumour cells confirmed the high binding affinity of these conjugates for &#945;V&#946;3 integrin&#8208;positive melanoma cells, as well as their integrin&#8208;mediated cell internalization. Two of these conjugates were efficient in inhibiting the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway, common to both integrin&#8208; and growth factor&#8208; biological targets. Such targeted conjugates could therefore be of special interest in melanoma treatment alone or in combination with other anticancer drugs.

Here we present three new dual covalent conjugates, in which a nintedanib unit is permanently linked to a cyclopeptidomimetic ligand for the &#945;&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;&#946;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; integrin, a transmembrane receptor involved in cell survival, proliferation and migration, which is overexpressed by tumour cells, and therefore recognized as marker for tumour targeting. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; assays on human melanoma tumour cells confirmed the high binding affinity of these conjugates for &#945;&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;&#946;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; integrin-positive melanoma cells, as well as their integrin-mediated cell internalization. Two of these conjugates were efficient in inhibiting the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway, common to both integrin- and growth factor- biological targets. Such targeted conjugates could therefore be of special interest in melanoma treatment alone or in combination with other anticancer drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Amphiphilic Iminosugar Pharmacological Chaperones towards &#946;&#8208;Glucocerebrosidase: Self&#8208;Assembly and Biological Activity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pharmacological chaperones (PCs) are new therapeutics for protein misfolding diseases, and amphiphilic PCs perform best in Gaucher Disease patients&#8217; cell lines. With the aim of investigating the biological activity vs aggregation behaviour of a new N&#8208;alkylated iminosugar&#8208;based PC, a complete physicochemical study in solution and in the solid state was performed, which ruled out a self&#8208;assembly based multivalent effect.







Abstract
Pharmacological chaperones (PCs) can restore correct enzymatic activity at sub&#8208;inhibitory concentrations and are considered an emerging therapy for Gaucher Disease (GD). Amphiphilic PCs show more favourable cross&#8208;membrane properties and have a higher activity on cells than hydrophilic PCs. To investigate whether the biological activity of amphiphilic iminosugars is related to their state as monomers or as micellar aggregates, we synthesized some novel N&#8208;alkylated iminosugars and performed physico&#8208;chemical characterizations in the solid state and in aqueous dispersion of the best compound in terms of biological activity. The results suggest that the C12 N&#8208;alkylated iminosugar 10 exerts its biological activity in the monomeric state, and that the low cell viability observed in the presence of a 50&#8197;&#956;M concentration of compound 10 is not related to the formation of micellar aggregates in solution.

         <title>Multicomponent Synthesis of Purines and Pyrimidines: From the Origin of Life to New Sustainable Approaches for Drug&#8208;Discovery Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is widely accepted that purines and pyrimidines, the building blocks that gave origin to life on our planet, were created through multicomponent reactions (MCRs) on early abiotic Earth. These heterocyclic scaffolds gradually evolved into a wide range of biologically relevant molecules regulating many different physiological processes and thus becoming widely exploited as templates for the development of new drugs. Accordingly, over the years, the synthetic community has dedicated many efforts in the attempt to hypothesize and replicate the original abiotic synthesis of purines and pyrimidines, thus developing a number of multicomponent synthesis to access these scaffolds. The following evolution of synthetic chemistry towards green approaches for the production of new molecules and the recent interest in pharmaceutical sustainability underlines the importance of multicomponent synthesis of new heterocycles. This review article provides an overview of the most important multicomponent approaches for the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine derivatives for potential pharmacological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Green Approach for N&#8210;H Functionalization of Sulfoximines: An Access to Sulfoximinated&#8208;Oxime Conjugates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple, metal&#8208;free and green approach has been established for N&#8210;H functionalization of sulfoximines under mild reaction conditions to offer sulfoximinated&#8208;oxime conjugates. The reaction works well in EtOH at room temperature and proceeds smoothly without using any base or expensive ligands. This protocol has been applied on various aryl&#8208;, heteroaryl&#8208; sulfoximines as well as on variety of chloro&#8208;oximes. Both the substrates tolerated a wide range of functional groups resulted in good to excellent yields. It can serve as a directing group in organic synthesis, as precursor or building block, demonstrating the product&#8217;s applicability and importance in the field. The applications of the protocol have been demonstrated in the sulfoximination of some natural products. This strategy could be useful in drug discovery or medicinal chemistry for fine&#8208;tuning the physicochemical properties of natural product scaffolds or lead candidates.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Oxetanes Based on the Combination of Azides and Tetrazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several new energetic oxetane derivatives with higher nitrogen contents than previously reported in the literature were synthesized and characterized. An azide group and a tetrazole moiety were introduced into the starting material oxetan&#8208;3&#8208;one to obtain a 3&#8208;disubstituted oxetane. The tetrazole ring of this energetic oxetane was further methylated, aminated and hydroxylated.







Abstract
Literature known energetic oxetane derivatives have a nitrogen content of up to 49.98&#8201;%. Through the introduction of azide and tetrazole functionalities attached to an oxetane ring, energetic oxetanes with higher nitrogen contents than previously reported in the literature were obtained. The newly synthesized oxetane derivatives were extensively characterized via 1H NMR, 13C{1H} NMR, 14N NMR, 15N NMR, 1H&#8208;15N HMBC, FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy and/or DTA. Their crystal structures were elucidated using X&#8208;ray diffraction, their sensitivities towards impact, friction and electrostatic discharge were determined and their energetic properties were calculated using the EXPLO5 code.

     alt="Nitrogen-Rich Oxetanes Based on the Combination of Azides and Tetrazoles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several new energetic oxetane derivatives with higher nitrogen contents than previously reported in the literature were synthesized and characterized. An azide group and a tetrazole moiety were introduced into the starting material oxetan-3-one to obtain a 3-disubstituted oxetane. The tetrazole ring of this energetic oxetane was further methylated, aminated and hydroxylated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Literature known energetic oxetane derivatives have a nitrogen content of up to 49.98&#8201;%. Through the introduction of azide and tetrazole functionalities attached to an oxetane ring, energetic oxetanes with higher nitrogen contents than previously reported in the literature were obtained. The newly synthesized oxetane derivatives were extensively characterized via &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C{&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H} NMR, &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N NMR, &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N NMR, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N HMBC, FT-IR spectroscopy and/or DTA. Their crystal structures were elucidated using X-ray diffraction, their sensitivities towards impact, friction and electrostatic discharge were determined and their energetic properties were calculated using the EXPLO5 code.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Chan&#8211;Lam Amination and Etherification of Aryl BMIDA Reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 45, December 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct Chan&#8211;Lam coupling of arylboronic acid methyliminodiacetic acid esters (ArBMIDA) with amine and alcohol nucleophiles is reported. Limitations of the process are also discussed. We also demonstrate how this method can be used in the chemoselective synthesis of heterocyclic scaffolds by using the unique attributes of the BMIDA protecting group.







Abstract
We report a method for the direct Chan&#8211;Lam coupling of arylboronic acid N&#8208;methyliminodiacetic acid esters (ArBMIDA) with amine and alcohol nucleophiles. A wide range of C&#8722;N and C&#8722;O cross&#8208;coupled products are obtained in 34&#8211;99&#8201;% yield (34&#8197;examples). This method serves to expand the scope of organoboron components that can be used directly in this oxidative coupling reaction and provides opportunities for streamlining synthesis.

         <title>Ionic Liquid&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;C Bond Formation for the Synthesis of Polysubstituted Olefins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 45, December 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acidic ionic liquid was used as a metal&#8208;free and recyclable catalyst for the synthesis of polysubstituted olefins by activating of ethers in dimethyl carbonate as a green solvent. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed a hydrogen bonding effect during the reaction.







Abstract
Polysubstituted olefins as attractive and useful compounds are generally acquired by traditional acid or metal catalyzed system. Herein, a convenient and environmentally friendly method using acidic ionic liquid as a metal&#8208;free catalyst and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as a green solvent has been demonstrated to synthesize polysubstituted olefins through construction of new C&#8722;C bonds by activating of ethers and alkenes. In the system, the usage of metal, halogen, traditional toxic solvents, and a large number of additives was avoided, neutralization after the reaction was not required, and waste production was reduced. The system was suitable for benzyl ethers and styrene derivatives, and recyclable [MeBs(dio)TMP][OTf] exhibited best activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest synergistic functions of the cation and anion of ILs and show hydrogen bonds and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions between catalyst and substrates, which can lead to lower barriers.

A catalyst&#8208;free tandem reaction that features several advantages (such as step/atom economy, both catalyst, and additive&#8208;free, simple work&#8208;up, short reaction times, and environmentally friendly conditions) was developed for the synthesis of spiro[2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran&#8208;3,3&#8217;&#8208;oxindole] derivatives from 2&#8208;(2&#8208;oxoindolin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)malononitriles and aldehydes.







Abstract
A catalyst&#8208;free tandem reaction was developed for the clean synthesis of spiro[2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran&#8208;3,3&#8217;&#8208;oxindole] derivatives from 2&#8208;(2&#8208;oxoindolin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)malononitriles and aldehydes in water. This method has an extensive substrate scope. The targeted products were easily isolated by filtration in high yields and excellent diastereoselectivities. The reaction also features numerous advantages, including step/atom economy, both catalyst and additive&#8208;free, no organic solvents, simple work&#8208;up, short reaction times, and environmentally friendly conditions. The present strategy utilizes simple conditions, demonstrating the potential application in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and biologically active compounds.

         <title>Theoretical Study on Chiral Boron Complex&#8208;Promoted Asymmetric Diels&#8208;Alder Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 45, December 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxychalcones with different dienes, promoted by chiral organo&#8208;boron Lewis acid complexes, was theoretically studied. Experimental results that couldn't be fully rationalized (as unexpected different enantioselectivities and low endo/exo selectivities) were clarified.







Abstract
The Diels&#8208;Alder reaction is a very interesting process that has been deeply studied in its achiral version. More recently, in its chiral version, it has also been the focus of many experimental and theoretical reports. Here, we study the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxychalcones, as dienophiles, with two dienes, catalyzed by chiral organo&#8208;boron Lewis acid complexes. We theoretically evaluate the mechanism that has been empirically proposed in the literature, and we clarify several results that didn't allow the full rationalization of the experimental data. Therefore, we show that similar ligands in the complexes lead to quite different enantioselectivities, due to different steric interactions with the attacking diene. In addition, we also conclude that the low endo/exo selectivities result from two opposite effects in the Diels&#8208;Alder transition states of the endo pathways, which substantially increase their activation energy, reaching values very similar to those calculated for the exo transition state structures.

         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;directed ortho&#8208;olefination reaction was developed using tri&#8208;isobutyl silicon&#8208;protected phenols as substrates, palladium acetate as the catalyst, and inexpensive pyridine derivatives as ligands. Importantly, bioactive molecules such as hydroquinone, hexylresorcin, and estradiol were able to be modified to increase the applicability of the reaction. Finally, simple reaction conditions were adopted to remove the protective group, which further demonstrates the practical applicability of the reaction.







Abstract
Herein, we report an undirected ortho&#8208;olefination reaction using tri&#8208;isobutyl silicon&#8208;protected phenol as the substrate, palladium acetate as the catalyst, and inexpensive pyridine derivatives as ligands. Various phenols were tolerated well, affording the olefinated product in moderate to good yields.

     alt="Palladium-Catalyzed Pyridine Ligand-Promoted Non-Directed C&#8722;H Olefination of Phenol Derivatives"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A non-directed ortho-olefination reaction was developed using tri-isobutyl silicon-protected phenols as substrates, palladium acetate as the catalyst, and inexpensive pyridine derivatives as ligands. Importantly, bioactive molecules such as hydroquinone, hexylresorcin, and estradiol were able to be modified to increase the applicability of the reaction. Finally, simple reaction conditions were adopted to remove the protective group, which further demonstrates the practical applicability of the reaction.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report an undirected ortho-olefination reaction using tri-isobutyl silicon-protected phenol as the substrate, palladium acetate as the catalyst, and inexpensive pyridine derivatives as ligands. Various phenols were tolerated well, affording the olefinated product in moderate to good yields. Importantly, bioactive compounds such as hexyl-methoxyphenol and estradiol were tolerated, highlighting the synthetic importance of this method.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
An effective strategy for constructing 1,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;one scaffolds was developed, which proceeded through radical addition and cyclization. This protocol features excellent regioselectivity and broad substrate scope.







Abstract
An effective strategy for construction of 1,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;one scaffolds by a cascade of 1,5&#8208;dienes with cyclobutanone oxime esters was developed. The reaction proceeded through radical addition, 5&#8208;endo cyclization, and subsequent deprotonation, in which two new C&#8722;C bonds were formed. This protocol features excellent regioselectivity and a low&#8208;cost catalyst, as well as broad substrate scope, which are expected to promote its potential applications in pharmacy and synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Expeditious and Stereoselective Synthesis of (1S)&#8208;Spiro[pyran&#8208;4&#8208;quinolines]</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 45, December 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spiro[pyran&#8208;4&#8208;quinolines] were synthesized in two steps from exo&#8208;glycals. The two steps could be performed consecutively in one&#8208;pot manner at 75&#8201;&#176;C, leading to formation of (1S)&#8208;spiro[pyran&#8208;4&#8208;quinolines] in 60&#8211;72&#8201;% overall yields with exclusive stereoselectivity (from the reactions of exo&#8208;galactals). A plausible mechanism was proposed to explain how the products were generated in a stereoselective manner.







Abstract
Spiro[pyran&#8208;4&#8208;quinolines] were synthesized in two steps from exo&#8208;glycals. The first step involved the double additions of aniline (or substituted anilines) to produce C,N&#8208;glycosides. The next step was to eliminate the anomeric N&#8208;aryl group by formation of benzophenone&#8208;derived imine, followed by in&#8197;situ intramolecular Friedel&#8722;Crafts alkylation. The resulting (1S)&#8208;spiro[pyran&#8208;4&#8208;quinolines] were obtained in 60&#8211;72&#8201;% overall yields with exclusive (from the reactions of exo&#8208;galactals) or high stereoselectivity (from those of exo&#8208;glucals with m&#8208;substituted anilines), respectively. Additionally, exo&#8208;galactals were found suitable to perform the two steps consecutively in one&#8208;pot at 75&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Bidentate N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Phosphinidene Supported Si(IV) Dicationic Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 45, December 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this publication the utilization of bis(NHCP) ligands is expanded towards complexation of silicon precursors giving access to Si(IV) dications [2&#8201;a] and [2&#8201;b]. These complexes present the first examples of bis(NHCP)&#8208;supported Si(IV) dications, showing expected high Lewis acidity. Reactivity investigations showed the insertion of diphenylketene in the Si&#8722;P bond of [2&#8201;a][OTf]2.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis and isolation of Si(IV) dications stabilized by a bidentate N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphinidene (NHCP). Treatment of the bis(NHCP) with Si(IV) bis(triflate) R2Si(OTf)2 (with R=H, Ph) resulted in the instant formation of Si(IV) dicationic complexes [2&#8201;a] and [2&#8201;b] featuring a tetracoordinated silicon centre. The dications show expected high Lewis acidity. The bis(NHCP)&#8208;stabilized parent silyl dication 2a (SiH22+) presents the first isolable example of a parent SiH2 dication. In addition, dication [2&#8201;a] is able to react with diphenylketene by insertion into the Si&#8722;P bond.

         <title>Synthetic Strategies for Versatile Thioester Building Blocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thioester constitutes a fundamentally unique intermediate, engaged in various biosynthesis processes in living systems as well as a versatile synthon in modern organic synthesis. Transition metal catalysis and radical reaction manifolds have enabled to enrich the repertoire of synthetic methods for thioesters. In this review, we have accommodated the recent reports on modern strategies towards thioester synthesis from a plethora of readily available feedstocks, such as alkenes, alkynes, alcohols, phenols or commodity chemicals/synthetic building blocks like organic aldehydes, halides or organoboron reagents under various catalysis domains. Furthermore, the momentous advancements of employing progenitors of odorous thiols as well as CO&#8208;surrogates have contextually been emphasized, alongside the utilization of native free thiols and CO gas.</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Sulfonamide as Hydrogen Bonding Catalyst in Catalytic Asymmetric Reactions: Concept and Application in the Past Decade</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 45, December 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional sulfonamides are powerful H&#8208;bonding catalysts in asymmetric organocatalysis due to their strong acidity and self&#8208;aggregation&#8208;free property. In this article, we tried to summarize bifunctional sulfonamides used as H&#8208;bonding catalysts in various asymmetric processes reported after 2011. The performances of these catalysts in asymmetric reaction including their catalytic activity, enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity were reviewed.







Abstract
Since the first report of bifunctional sulfonamide organocatalysts in 2004, these chiral compounds have proven to be a reliable hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalyst and have been wildly employed in asymmetric organocatalysis due to its strong acidity and self&#8208;aggregation&#8208;free property. Herein, we review the application of bifunctional sulfonamide as hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalyst after 2011, and our highlights will cover asymmetric process including aldol reaction, Michael addition, Mannich reaction, desymmetrization and cyclization.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydroaminoalkylation of Allenes and Methylenecyclopropanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 45, December 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,2,3&#8208;Trisubstituted cyclopropane products exhibiting a structurally interesting cis&#8208;orientation of all three cyclopropane hydrogen atoms and a 2&#8208;aminoethyl side chain are regio&#8208; and stereoselectively accessible by titanium&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminoalkylation reactions of bicyclic methylenecyclopropanes. In addition, synthetically promising allylamines can be obtained from 1,1&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allenes under comparable reaction conditions.







Abstract
Intermolecular hydroaminoalkylation reactions of 1,1&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allenes as well as methylenecyclopropanes with secondary amines can be achieved in the presence of a 2,6&#8208;bis(phenylamino)pyridinato titanium catalyst at 140&#8201;&#176;C within 2&#8211;8&#8197;h. Corresponding reactions of allenes with N&#8208;benzylanilines deliver branched allylamine products in very good yields (up to 83&#8201;%) and with branched&#8208;linear&#8208;ratios between 75&#8201;:&#8201;25 and 95&#8201;:&#8201;5. In contrast, bicyclic methylenecyclopropanes undergo hydroaminoalkylation with N&#8208;benzylanilines or N&#8208;alkylbenzylamines to give linear products in good to excellent yields (up to 98&#8201;%) with perfect regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The corresponding 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted (2&#8208;aminoethyl)cyclopropane products exhibit a structurally interesting cis&#8208;orientation of all three cyclopropane hydrogen atoms.

         <title>Deoxygenative Chlorination of Aldehydes and Alcohols with Dichloromethyl Methyl Ether and TiCl4</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 45, December 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of chloride and geminal dichloride derivatives through deoxygenative chlorination of aldehydes and alcohols was achieved in good to excellent yields by using dichloromethyl methyl ether and TiCl4. Given the nature of benzal chlorides, deoxygenative chlorination of aldehydes could serve as a platform for installing a second aldehyde on the aromatic ring by combining formylation reactions in the same reagent system.







Abstract
Here, we report highly efficient deoxygenative chlorination of aldehydes and alcohols with a dichloromethyl methyl ether and TiCl4 system. The method converts various aldehydes and alcohols into the desired geminal dichlorides or chlorides with good to excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;%). Combined with a subsequent Rieche formylation step using the same reagent system, this method provides an efficient approach for synthesis of aromatic dialdehydes. This strategy involves deoxy&#8208;chlorination of the aryl aldehydes followed by a second formylation of more activated benzal chloride derivatives. Dialdehydes can be easily obtained by hydrolyzing the corresponding of dichloromethyl derivative.

         <title>C&#8208;H Activation of 2&#8208;Arylbenzoxazinones in Aqueous Medium: Synthesis of Fused Isoindolinones Using a Heterogeneous Magnetic Pd&#8208;Catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 45, December 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A recyclable magnetic&#8208;Pd catalyst has been used in decarboxylative C&#8722;H activation of 2&#8208;aryl benzoxazinones for the synthesis of fused&#8208;isoindolinone derivatives in aqueous medium under aerial atmosphere at 40&#8201;&#176;C. Controlling the reaction temperature the reaction can be arrested at an intermediate step to obtain the ortho&#8208;acylated product selectively.







Abstract
We have developed a C&#8722;H activation protocol of 2&#8208;arylbenzoxazinones in aqueous medium under open aerial atmosphere at close to room temperature (40&#8201;&#176;C) using magnetic Pd&#8208;catalyst. 2&#8208;Arylbenzoxazinones react with phenylglyoxylic acids via decarboxylative C&#8722;H acylation followed by cyclization reaction to produce the isoindolinone compounds. The reaction can be arrested at the intermediate step to obtain the ortho&#8208;acylated derivative at a certain lower temperature. The heterogeneous Pd&#8208;catalyst is easy to separate magnetically and shows good recyclability.

2&#8208;Isoxazoline and 2&#8208;isoxazolin&#8208;5&#8208;one heterocycles are found in a wide range of biologically active molecules, as well as being important synthetic precursors. This review highlights the published methods that enable the enantioselective synthesis of these challenging heterocycles and discusses the future needs of the research area.







Abstract
Although there is an abundance of methods for the enantioselective synthesis of 2&#8208;isoxazolines and 2&#8208;isoxazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ones, relatively few of these approaches have been reported when these heterocycles bear fully substituted stereocenters. In this review, we will detail the methods that have been used to successfully accomplish these challenging asymmetric transformations and give insights into their importance, such as allowing access to unique three&#8208;dimensional chemical space. The limitations of the currently known reactions will be discussed, as well as highlighting the future developments needed to advance the research field.

         <title>100 Years of Vitamin E: From Discovery to Commercialization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 45, December 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article provides the current state of science in the field of vitamin E, focusing on the industrial production. Additionally, formulation approaches as well as the many applications in animal and human nutrition and health, biosynthesis, isolation approaches and future trends are discussed.







Abstract
2022 marks the centenary of the discovery of vitamin E by Evans and Bishop, an important milestone in vitamin research. An enormous amount of scientific data related to the importance of its activity has been published on this micronutrient. Globally, researchers from industry and academia have contributed to improve and implement highly efficient and commercially viable production processes for vitamin E. All processes share a common final step, but differ in the generation of their key building blocks. Today, Vitamin E, accounts for a worldwide production of &gt;75.000&#8197;t/a. Vitamin E is applied predominantly as feed supplement for various animal species and in addition is used in a variety of human applications. Moreover, its impressive antioxidative behavior enables frequent use as stabilizing ingredient in many product forms and final consumer applications. This review will provide the current state of science, with clear focus on highlighting the different routes for industrial syntheses of vitamin E. Furthermore, approaches directed towards successful product form development including suitable auxiliary substances combined with appropriate formulation technologies, as well as a broad variety of applications in animal and human nutrition and health will be discussed. Insights on isolation approaches, biosynthesis, and future trends complete the status of Vitamin E research.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2022 marks the centenary of the discovery of vitamin E by Evans and Bishop, an important milestone in vitamin research. An enormous amount of scientific data related to the importance of its activity has been published on this micronutrient. Globally, researchers from industry and academia have contributed to improve and implement highly efficient and commercially viable production processes for vitamin E. All processes share a common final step, but differ in the generation of their key building blocks. Today, Vitamin E, accounts for a worldwide production of &amp;gt;75.000&#8197;t/a. Vitamin E is applied predominantly as feed supplement for various animal species and in addition is used in a variety of human applications. Moreover, its impressive antioxidative behavior enables frequent use as stabilizing ingredient in many product forms and final consumer applications. This review will provide the current state of science, with clear focus on highlighting the different routes for industrial syntheses of vitamin E. Furthermore, approaches directed towards successful product form development including suitable auxiliary substances combined with appropriate formulation technologies, as well as a broad variety of applications in animal and human nutrition and health will be discussed. Insights on isolation approaches, biosynthesis, and future trends complete the status of Vitamin E research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Radical&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;H Alkylation of Glycine Derivatives: A Straightforward Strategy for Diverse &#945;&#8208;Unnatural Amino Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 45, December 6, 2022. </description>

Modification of glycine is the one of the most straightforward strategy to access diverse unnatural amino acids. This review outlines an overview of recently developed transformations employing radical&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H alkylation of N&#8208;aryl glycine derivatives.







Abstract
Unnatural amino acids are important scaffolds for novel drug candidates, and especially &#945;&#8208;alkyl amino acids have emerged as a valuable variant. This is due to the ubiquity of alkyl groups, which are pervasive as key motifs in natural products, biological and pharmaceutical molecules. The development of radical&#8208;based approaches in organic synthesis has expanded dramatically in recent years. It has enabled site&#8208; and region&#8208;specific installation of a variety of functionalities in small molecules, which has been spontaneously applied in the preparation of versatile amino acid building blocks. The glycine motif in the backbone of amino acids has gained significant attention for allowing access to a variety of complex &#945;&#8208;unnatural amino acids via radical&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H alkylation. This review summarizes the last decade's development of radical&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H alkylation of glycine derivatives to provide unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acids. The advantages, current limitations, and perspectives of glycine&#8208;based unnatural amino acid synthesis are also discussed.

         <title>The Journey to Fluorescent Bullvalenes: Pitfalls and Prospects</title>

Lighting up shape&#8208;shifting molecules: The fluxional bullvalene core supports the excimer formation of its two naphthoyl substituents leading to a characteristic excimer emission.







Abstract
A dinaphthoylmethyl&#8208;substituted bullvalene derivative is presented that exhibits excimer fluorescence. It is demonstrated that the fluxional bullvalene core supports the excimer formation of the aroyl substituents, thus offering the opportunity to monitor externally induced structural changes by fluorescence spectroscopy, as exemplarily shown by fluorimetric analysis of host&#8208;guest interactions of the diaroylbullvalene with metal cations, which lead to significant changes of the excimer emission. During the synthesis of the bullvalenes, it was discovered coincidentally that the corresponding triplet&#8208;sensitized photoreaction also yielded three unknown lumibullvalene isomers. The NMR&#8208;spectroscopic analysis of this reaction revealed a sequence and combination of different di&#8208; and tri&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane rearrangements and sigmatropic rearrangements. More importantly, the static lumibullvalenes proved useful as reference compounds for the evaluation of the emission properties of the fluxional bullvalenes.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of the DE Ring Portion of Kadcoccilactone A by a Radical Addition/Cyclization Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 45, December 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic decarboxylative addition/cyclization/fragmentation sequence can be employed for the stereoselective construction of the hydrindan skeleton of kadcoccilactone A. The tricyclic product could be transformed to the DE ring fragment having three contiguous quaternary stereocenters in an eight&#8208;step sequence involving an intramolecular alkylation. Phth=phthaloyl, TBS=tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl, bpy=bipyridine.







Abstract
A stereoselective synthesis of the DE ring portion of kadcoccilactone A, triterpenoid isolated from Kadsura coccinea, has been achieved starting from a chiral building block, utilizing a photocatalytic decarboxylative addition/cyclization/fragmentation sequence to construct the five&#8208;membered ring and intramolecular alkylation to create the quaternary stereocenter as key steps.

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Oxatricyclo[7.2.0.01,5]undeca&#8208;7,10&#8208;dienes through Intramolecular Photocycloaddition Reactions of Alkenes to 1,8&#8201;a&#8208;Position of Naphthalene Ring</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 45, December 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intramolecular photoreaction of 2&#8208;cyanonaphthalene with styrene afforded tricyclo compounds in yields of up to 68&#8201;% via photo cyclo adducts at the 1,8a&#8208;position of the naphthalene ring. Photoreactions between naphthalene and alkenes are known to proceed at various positions on the naphthalene ring. However, selective reaction at the 1,8a&#8208;position was achieved for the first time by appropriate design of intramolecular singlet exciplexes.







Abstract
Benzene solutions of 1&#8208;(5&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;oxapent&#8208;4&#8208;enyl)&#8208;2&#8208;cyanonaphthalenes 6 were irradiated with a high&#8208;pressure mercury lamp for 20&#8197;h to give 3&#8208;oxatricyclo[7.2.0.01,5]undecadienes 7 in good yields. In all cases, the trans isomer was preferentially obtained. Sensitization and quenching experiments showed that the reaction proceeds via an excited singlet state. When a dichloromethane solution of 6 was irradiated for only 1&#8197;h, an eight&#8208;membered ring compound 8 was obtained as an intermediate. When the obtained 8 was irradiated, the final product 7 was produced. The long wavelength absorption of 6 originates from the 2&#8208;cyanonaphthalene chromophore, indicating that the reaction is initiated by photoexcitation of the naphthalene ring. In addition, the fluorescence of 6 was intramolecularly quenched, and a weak intramolecular exciplex emission was observed at 400&#8211;550&#8197;nm. In this reaction, after photoexcitation of 6, a [2+2] photocycloadduct is formed at the 1,8a&#8208;position of the naphthalene ring via an intramolecular singlet exciplex, followed by thermal ring&#8208;opening and 4&#960; disrotatory ring&#8208;closure leads to 7.

         <title>Designing Modular Assembly of Electrochemical Flow Microreactor as an Enabling Technology of Electrosynthesis in Laminar Flow</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 45, December 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, three newly developed microreactors for organic electrosynthesis in laminar flow are reported: undivided, divided, and electrophotochemical reactors. These flow reactors are easy to assemble, compatible with various organic solvents, and adaptable with a reference electrode. Paired electrolysis and electrophotocatalysis in a flow reactor are successfully demonstrated.







Abstract
Flow microreactors are well&#8208;suited for organic electrosynthesis because they provide a large surface area for reactions and enable precise control of the residence time. Here, we developed three novel electrochemical flow microreactors for organic electrosynthesis: undivided, divided, and electrophotochemical reactors. These flow reactors were easily assembled using modules made of solvent&#8208;resistant plastics and feature high interchangeability of each component and the applicability of a reference electrode. We evaluated our reactors on the basis of the redox response of ferrocene and ferrocenemethanol. The results suggested that the reactors maintain laminar flow with both aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes. We applied these reactors to paired electrosynthesis and electrophotocatalysis, demonstrating the utility of these systems for electrosynthesis in a laminar flow.

&lt;p&gt;Here, three newly developed microreactors for organic electrosynthesis in laminar flow are reported: undivided, divided, and electrophotochemical reactors. These flow reactors are easy to assemble, compatible with various organic solvents, and adaptable with a reference electrode. Paired electrolysis and electrophotocatalysis in a flow reactor are successfully demonstrated.

The investigation on the product selectivity control of divergent domino reactions of &#946;&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;ynones with acyl chlorides is reported. A viable approach to the synthesis of challenging 4H&#8208;[3,4&#8208;c]quinolone&#8208;4,5(6H)&#8208;diones and benzo[c][2,7]naphthyridine&#8208;4,5(3H,6H)&#8208;diones is described.







Abstract
A viable one&#8208;pot synthesis of challenging 4H&#8208;[3,4&#8208;c]quinolone&#8208;4,5(6H)&#8208;diones by the reaction of &#946;&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;ynones with ethyl malonyl chloride is described. Their further elaboration in the presence of an excess of 40&#8201;% methyl amine aqueous solution in EtOH gives the benzo[c][2,7]naphthyridine&#8208;4,5(3H,6H)&#8208;diones of pharmacological interest in high yields. The product selectivity control of the divergent sequential condensation/C&#8208;annulation/intramolecular transesterification vs condensation/O&#8208;annulation/ring opening reactions of &#946;&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;ynones with malonyl chloride under metal free conditions has been addressed.

         <title>Aryltriazenes as Coupling Partners in the Hiyama, Hiyama&#8208;Suzuki and Hiyama&#8208;Heck Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions Using Conventional and Ionic Liquid Reagents and Solvents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2022, Issue 45, December 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Hiyama cross&#8208;coupling was investigated in ionic liquids and in conventional solvents and reagents using triazenes as coupling partners. A method in which ILs act as solvent, Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid/promoter, fluoride ion source, and base made it possible to develop hyphenated Hiyama&#8208;Suzuki and Hiyama&#8208;Heck protocols. Scope of these transformations was studied.







Abstract
Application of conventional and ionic liquid (IL) solvents and reagents in the Hiyama cross&#8208;coupling reactions using triazenes as coupling partners was investigated. The microwave&#8208;assisted and Pd&#8208;catalyzed reactions in ROH/HBF4, ROH/BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O and in [BMIM][X]/[BMIM(SO3H)][OTf]/[BMIM][F] proved effective and gave respectable isolated yields within minutes. The scope of the Hiyama coupling reaction with triazenes was investigated in these media. The IL reagents and solvents were successfully employed to develop stepwise and sequential/tandem Hiyama&#8208;Suzuki (H&#8722;S) and Hiyama&#8208;Heck (H&#8722;H) methods. Study of the scope of these transformations led to facile synthesis of libraries of biaryls, hetero&#8208;biaryls, diphenylmethanes, styryl&#8208;biphenyls, and a host of biphenyl&#8208;appended heterocycles. The potential for the recycling/reuse of the IL solvents in the Hiyama reaction, and in stepwise and sequential transformations was also examined.

         <dc:description>A palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative amidation of conjugated olefin with 2&#8208;pyridone is described. A series of E&#8208;Enamides were synthesized in a highly stereocontrolled manner. The reaction also accommodates other cyclic and acyclic amides. Z&#8208;Enamides were predominantly prepared for primary amides probably due to the presence of an intramolecular hydrogen bond. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis of enamide and the following oxidative annulation with diphenylacetylene demonstrates the synthetic utility of this reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyridine&#8208;Boryl Radical Mediated Decarboxylative Homolytic Substitution of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide Ester with Ar2X2 (X=S, Se)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a metal&#8208;free approach to construct C&#8208;X (X=S, Se) bonds with the broadly available N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters and disulfides/diselenides (Ar2X2,X = S or Se) using bis(pinacolato)diboron as the reductant. Density functional theory calculations and control experiments reveal that such a C&#8208;X bond formation process is reductive decarboxylationmediated from pyridine&#8208;boryl radical to yield alkyl or aryl radical. The resulting carbon radical then reacts with disulfides or diselenides via a bimolecular homolytic substitution (SH2) mechanism to afford the corresponding sulfides or selenides. This method displays a high functional group tolerance and broad substrate applicability.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed and PTSA&#8208;Promoted Cycloisomerization of Ynamides to Access Pyrrole Substituted a, b&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Substituted pyrroles are prevalent aromatic ring systems encountered in numerous natural products and bioactive molecules. Herein, a novel ynamide scaffold has been designed, synthesized and subsequently applied to an unprecedented gold&#8208;catalyzed and PTSA&#8208;assisted cascade cycloisomerization reaction for the synthesis of b&#8208;pyrrole substituted a, b&#8208;unsaturated ketones. Notably, the reaction is stereoselective, offering E&#8208;isomer as major product with low to moderate yield.</dc:description>

         <title>ortho&#8208;Quinols in (Bio)Synthesis of Natural Products</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>6&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxycyclohexa&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienone derivatives, commonly referred to as&#160;ortho&#8208;quinols, and their simple ester and ether variants constitute a class of organic compounds that aroused much interest amongst chemists over the past 70 years for several reasons related to organic synthesis, natural product chemistry and biochemistry. It was very early on that organic chemists understood the potential of the unique yet versatile chemical reactivity of such compounds to synthesize more complex structures, and it soon emerged that&#160;ortho&#8208;quinols could constitute key intermediates in the biosynthesis of certain natural products of various origins. This minireview discusses the chemistry of&#160;ortho&#8208;quinols from the point of view of their role in the synthesis and biosynthesis of natural products.&#160;Examples of completed syntheses of natural products mostly taken in the literature of the last 20 years or so, together with some chosen pieces from older but pioneering and most remarkable works,&#160;are highlighted to illustrate this discussion.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein the application of 1,1&#8208;bis[(pinacolato)boryl]methane as a new type of terminating reagents to realize three&#8208;component coupling reaction with aryl iodide and different electrophiles. A series of ortho&#8208;disubstituted benzylboronates can be synthesized and the ortho&#8208;substituent can be varied by using bromoacetic esters or O&#8208;benzoyl hydroxylamine as electrophiles with slightly modified reaction conditions. The reaction shows good functional group tolerance and the obtained benzyl boronate products can be easily transformed to various synthetically useful compounds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Hydroxy amides are an essential class of compounds found in natural products and bioactive molecules of drug candidates. Herein we report a facile and direct approach to these compounds through oxalic acid decarbonylation/decarboxylation during the Passerini three&#8208;component reaction (P&#8208;3CR) under solvent&#8208;free conditions, with microwave heating. This very convenient methodology provides the title compounds through a possible concerted intramolecular decarbonylation/decarboxylation from the &#945;&#8208;acyloxy amide intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Origins of the Reactivity in 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions of Acyl&#8208;isocyanide Ylides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions are the preferred method to generate five&#8208;membered heterocyclic rings. Surprisingly, cycloadditions based on acyl&#8208;isocyanide ylides have remained underexplored by the chemical community. Acyl&#8208;isocyanide ylides readily react with dipolarophiles, such as substituted alkenes, to yield &#916;1&#8208;pyrroline derivatives. As an explanation for the observed reactivity of this reaction is lacking, extensive density functional theory calculations were performed to scrutinize the mechanistic features of the transformation. Herein we explain the experimental outcome of the reaction using a variety of reactivity theories and predict opposed regioselectivity for electron&#8208;poor and electron&#8208;rich dipolarophiles. With the insights obtained, we hope to incentivize the design of new cycloaddition reactions based on the acyl&#8208;isocyanide ylides motif.</dc:description>

         <title>CuMoO4 Catalyzed&#160; Csp 2&#8208;Se Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aryl Bromide and Iodide with Diaryldiselenides in Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein demonstrated, an oxo&#8208;bridged bimetallic CuMoO4 catalyst for Csp2&#8208;Se cross&#8208;coupling of diaryldiselenides with aryl&#8208;halides. The current discovery is noteworthy, as the catalyst is eco&#8208;friendly, easily accessible, air&#8208;stable, and recyclable. The methodology exhibits broad substrate scope and the catalytic system tolerates common functional groups. The protocol uses aryl iodide and bromides as electrophile instead of boronic acids. This is the first example of using an oxo&#8208; bridged copper based bimetallic catalyst for Csp2&#8208;Se cross&#8208;coupling reactions in water. C&#8208;Cl bond remains intact during reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;&#960; Interaction for Molecular Recognition of Anions : Focus on Cooperativity with Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion recognition represents an intense area of research in supramolecular chemistry. The last two decades have been marked by spectacular advances in the design of new anion receptors. Moreover, the development of approaches combining experimental and theoretical studies has proved to be particularly relevant, allowing a better understanding and rationalization of the phenomena involved in anion complexation processes. In this context, the combination of weak interactions within the same receptor and their synergistic effects, called cooperativity, has attracted increasing interest within the scientific community. This review focuses on the combination of anion&#8208;&#960; and hydrogen bonds and the emerging concept of cooperativity. The most relevant anion&#8208;&#960; donor families are presented. The concept of cooperativity is illustrated using the most recent examples present in current literature.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An expedient method for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from homoallylic carbonic acid esters by means of photo&#8208;aerobic selenium&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acid multicatalysis is reported. Until now, conceptually related methods commonly relied either on the stoichiometric addition of electrophiles onto the substrate&#8217;s alkene moiety or the presence of pre&#8208;installed leaving groups in allylic position of said alkene to &#8211; in part, catalytically &#173;&#8211; initiate an intramolecular attack by an adjacent carbonic acid ester group. In sharp contrast, the current study shows that the C&#8211;C double bond of homoallylic carbonic acid esters can be directly activated by the catalytic interplay of a pyrylium dye and a diselane using ambient air as the sole oxidant and visible light as an energy source.</dc:description>

         <title>Furylenevinylene oligomers as extended conjugated systems issue from renewable materials</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of furylenevinylene oligomers (FV) were synthesized of common furan platforms derived of lignocellulosic biomass. Their electronic properties were evaluated by UV&#8208;Vis absorption and cyclic voltammetry and compared with thienylenevinylene analogues (TV). The difference between the electronic properties of these extended vinyl&#8208;heterocycle derivatives is mainly due to the less aromaticity character of the furan cycle that allows an easier access to the quinoidic form and thus procure a better electronic delocalization. As a main consequence, the access to dication state is favoured for the furan derivatives with a quasi&#8208;coalescence of the two first oxidation potentials for 5 FV units.</dc:description>

         <title>Flexibility versus Rigidity: How Conformational Constraint, Steric Hinderance and Solvent Impact Binding Between &#960;&#8208;electron Poor Tweezer&#8208;Type Hosts and &#960;&#8208;Electron Rich Guests.</title>

         <dc:description>Tweezer&#8208;type receptors that form p&#8208;p stacked supramolecular complexes are important components in functional polymers and molecular machines. Herein, we study how varying specific structural components of tweezer&#8208;receptors impacts their binding. A library of tweezer receptors, each containing two p&#8208;electron poor receptor residues and differing by the nature of the linking unit which was either a flexible 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylamine) residue or a rigid&#160;3,3&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;diamino&#8208;m&#8208;terphenyl diamine structure, were synthesised. Each tweezer formed 1:1 supramolecular complexes with p&#8208;electron rich residues (1,5&#8208;dihydroxynapthalene and pyrene) as confirmed by UV/Vis and&#160;1H NMR spectroscopic studies. Binding constants were determined to be between 2.3x10&#8208;5&#160;and 71 M&#8208;1&#160;in organic solvents and were one magnitude greater in aqueous solvents for water soluble systems. The nature of the linker had variable effects on the binding constants, showing the design of tweezer type supramolecular receptors with targeted&#160;Ka&#160;values is non&#8208;trivial and requires structural optimisation supported by binding constant determination studies.</dc:description>

The structure of Z&#8208;isomer of 3&#8208;methylene&#8208;isoindolinone 3x was confirmed by a single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The reaction mechanism studies by control experiments and using O18&#8208;labelled water revealed that the reaction was initiated by attack of a conjugate base of aryl/heteroaryl methyl ketones (2a&#8208;k) to aldehyde group of 1a&#8208;h followed by intramolecular oxidative cyclization involving nitrile functionality to furnish isoindolinone derivatives in good to excellent yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Homocoupling of 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;N&#8208;heterocycles and Application to the Synthesis of Phenylpyridine Borane Dimers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a regioselective cross&#8208;dehydrogenative homocoupling reaction using a heterogeneous Ru catalyst and iron trichloride as oxidant to gain access to various 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic dimers. Several homocoupling products obtained were then used to synthesize a series of pyridine&#8208;borane complexes and the impact of the dimerization on their photophysical properties was studied and rationalized by using theoretical calculations.







Abstract
A method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic dimers via a cross&#8208;dehydrogenative homocoupling (homo&#8208;CDC) has been developed using commercially available Ruthenium on charcoal as catalyst and iron trichloride as oxidant. A large variety of heterocyclic scaffolds and functional groups are tolerated and a complete regioselectivity resulting from the activation of the less sterically hindered C&#8722;H bonds was observed for meta&#8208;substituted substrates. Starting from several homocoupling products obtained, a series of pyridine&#8208;borane complexes was synthesized and the impact of the dimerization on their photophysical properties was studied and rationalized using theoretical calculations.

         <title>Boron Catalysis in the Transformation of Carboxylic Acids and Carboxylic Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carboxylic acids, amides, and esters are ubiquitous motifs in functional organic molecules. However, the reactivities of these high oxidation state carbonyl compounds are far lower than ketones and aldehydes, and catalysts applicable to transformations of this class of carbonyl compounds have been limited. On the other hand, boron catalysts have found various applications in the transformation of carbonyl compounds by taking advantage of the unique properties derived from their vacant p&#8208;orbitals. The continuous advancement of boron catalysis has realized several unprecedented direct transformations of carboxylic acids, amides, and esters in the past decade. In this review, representative achievements of boron catalysis are summarized according to reaction types by focusing on their applications to non&#8208;activated carboxylic acids, amides, and esters.</dc:description>

         <title>Vanadium Catalyst for C&#8211;&#160;and S&#8211;alkylation of Benzhydrols in Water: An Experimental Study and Green Metrics Evaluation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy for the vanadium&#8208;catalyzed dehydrative C&#8211; and S&#8211;alkylation by nucleophilic substitution of benzhydrols with arenes and thiols are reported. The alkylation was achieved with the divanadium oxoperoxo complex [K3(V+5)2(O22&#8722;)4(O2&#8722;)2(&#956;&#8208;OH)] in water under aerobic conditions. The newly developed transformation could accommodate a broad substrate scope including (hetero)arenes and thiols (34 examples). Both the symmetrical and unsymmetrical benzhydrols furnished excellent yields of the alkylated product under mild reaction conditions. The scope of this strategy was further extended to synthesize bis&#8208;benzylated arenes (polyarylated products) in high yields and regioselectivities. The green metrics determination of all the alkylated products suggests the technical and environmental benefits of the present protocol. The longevity experiment reveals the catalytic activity was maintained over seven cycles. To understand the mechanism of the present reaction, detailed spectroscopic and kinetic studies were undertaken. This simple protocol, which affords the desired products with water as the by&#8208;product, can be achieved under mild conditions without the need for a base or other additives.</dc:description>

         <title>Persulfate&#8208;Mediated Oxidative C&#8208;H Functionalization of Glycinates to Access Diverse Unnatural Amino Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed an operationally simple and green approach to prepare robust &#945;&#8208;alkyl unnatural amino acids via the dual oxidative activation of glycine derivatives and alkylcarboxylic acids with persulfate as the sole oxidizing agent. This method allows the utilization of naturally abundant alkylcarboxylic acids as radical sources without the assistance of catalysts.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We have developed an operationally simple and green approach to prepare robust &#945;-alkyl unnatural amino acids via the dual oxidative activation of glycine derivatives and alkylcarboxylic acids with persulfate as the sole oxidizing agent. This method allows the utilization of naturally abundant alkylcarboxylic acids as radical sources without the assistance of catalysts. It is noteworthy that this method allows for the late-stage decoration of biologically relevant carboxylic acids and peptides to construct diverse unnatural amino acids. In addition, the generality of the oxidative activation method enables to offer a facile synthetic approach to &#945;-phosphonyl glycine derivatives by using phosphites and phosphine oxides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Peptide Conjugated Dihydroazulene/Vinylheptafulvene Photoswitches in Aqueous Environment</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of dihydroazulene/vinylheptafulvene (DHA/VHF) photoswitches was prepared and studied in various media regarding their photophysical, photochemical, and thermal properties. To pave the way towards the use of DHAs as building blocks in bio(macro)molecules, we synthesized peptide conjugates including the 17&#8208;amino acid ALFA peptide and found excellent switching properties of the biohybrid constructs in aqueous media.&#8201;







Abstract
Light&#8208;responsive molecules have seen a major advance in modulating biological functions in recent years. Especially photoswitches are highly attractive building blocks due to the reversible nature of their light&#8208;mediated reactivity. They are frequently used to affect both the properties of small bioactive compounds and biomacromolecules if incorporated suitably. Despite their success in a plethora of applications, only a limited set of photochromic core structures is routinely employed and a large number of photochromic couples are under&#8208;investigated in biological context. Broadening the toolbox of photoswitches available to modulate biological activity would open new avenues and unlock the full potential of photoswitchable molecules for biological studies. In this work, we explore the photochemical and thermal properties of the dihydroazulene/vinylheptafulvene photochromic couple as peptide conjugates in aqueous environment.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Arylnaphthalene Lignans through a Photochemical Key Step</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total syntheses of arylnaphthalene lignans (ANL) Vitrofolal E (1), Noralashinol C (2), and Ternifoliuslignan E (3) are described. These natural products have in common a missing substituent in 2&#8208;position of the naphthalene skeleton (2H&#8208;ANL). The key step of the syntheses is the Photo&#8208;Dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (PDDA) reaction between arylalkyne moieties, which are connected by a suberate linker unit. The reasons for the regioselectivity of the photochemical ring closure were investigated by means of DFT methods.







Abstract
The total syntheses of three arylnaphthalene lignans (ANLs) were developed: Vitrofolal E (1), Noralashinol C (2), and Ternifoliuslignan E (3). These natural products have in common a missing substituent in 2&#8208;position of the naphthalene moiety (2H&#8208;ANLs). The key step of these syntheses is a regioselective intramolecular Photo&#8208;Dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (PDDA) reaction with (1,7)naphthalenophanes as primary products. A further improvement of the photochemical step was achieved by triplet sensitization with xanthone, allowing the use of more efficient UVA lamps. It should be noted that this work is a continuation of a previous publication about the total synthesis of lignans using the PDDA reaction.[1]

         <title>Tuning the Electro&#8208;Optical Properties of Mixed&#8208;Halide Trityl Radicals Bearing para&#8208;Brominated Positions through Halogen Substitution</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new mixed&#8208;halide trityl radicals bearing p&#8208;brominated positions were synthesized in good yield from halogenated triphenylmethanes obtained by multistep Friedel&#8208;Crafts reactions. Their electrochemical and spectroscopic properties were reported as well as quantum&#8208;chemical calculations carried out to supplement the experimental investigation. The most blue&#8208;shifted emission among trityl radicals was achieved for the highly fluorinated trityl radical.







Abstract
In this work, the synthesis and characterization of two new trityl radicals bearing two p&#8208;brominated positions, i.&#8201;e. the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;((perchlorophenyl)methylene)bis(1,3,5&#8208;tribromobenzene) radical and the 6,6&#8242;&#8208;((perchlorophenyl)methylene)bis(3&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene) radical, are presented. Slightly modifying the strategy typically used for the synthesis of non&#8208;symmetric mixed&#8208;halide trityl radicals, we were able to considerably increase the reaction yield for the radical precursors. In addition, for the first time the electro&#8208;optical properties of a highly fluorinated trityl radical were studied, achieving the most blue&#8208;shifted emission for a trityl radical reported up to now. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations carried out to supplement the experimental investigation support the electrochemical and spectroscopic data as well as rationalize the observed blue shift of the highly fluorinated species.

         <title>Perfluorinated Sulfonate Resins as Reusable Heterogeneous Catalysts for the One&#8208;pot Synthesis of DiPhenolic Esters (DPEs)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Levulinic acid, easily obtained from cellulose, represents a fundamental chemical platform for a number of valuable building blocks. Among them, diphenolic acid and its esters (DPA and DPE) are valid candidates to replace Bisphenol A in polycarbonate and epoxy resin production processes. In this study, we report a one&#8208;pot synthesis of alkyl DPEs in the presence of a heterogenous acid catalyst starting from levulinic acid, an alcohol and phenol as solvent&#8208;reagent. The most interesting member of the DPE family, the ethyl 4,4&#8208;bis(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)pentanoate, is selectively obtained in a good yield in the presence of a commercially available heterogeneous acid catalyst, the Aquivion, which can be reused for at least six times without any noticeable loss in activity.</dc:description>

         <title>1,8&#8208;Diarylnaphthalenes: Synthesis, Properties, and Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract. 1,8&#8208;Diarylnaphthalenes are a fascinating example of strained organic molecules that have found many practical applications due to unusual parallel face&#8208;to&#8208;face arrangement of two peri&#8208;aryl rings in close proximity almost perpendicular to the central naphthalene backbone. 1,8&#8208;Diarylnaphthalenes show notable potential as photoluminescent and chiral sensors, stereodynamic switches, nonlinear optic chromophores, blue&#8208;transparent frequency doublers, materials for creating high&#8208;performance blue and green OLEDs, chiral ligands and so on. Molecules of this type have also been used as convenient models for studying &#960;&#8211;&#960;, dipole&#8208;&#960; and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions. 1,8&#8208;Diarylnaphthalenes are also interesting as objects to study atropisomeric transformations: if the peri&#8208;aryl rings have ortho&#8208; or meta&#8208;substituents, then the anti&#8208;conformer becomes C2&#8208;symmetrical (hence chiral), and the syn&#8208;isomer upon symmetrical substitution is achiral. Despite the extensive knowledge accumulated and the usefulness of these compounds that have become apparent, there are still no reviews on 1,8&#8208;diarylnaphthalenes. In this review, data on synthetic methods, applications, atropisomerism and structural characteristics of 1,8diaryl&#8208; and 1,8&#8208;dihetarylnaphthalenes are summarized.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Alkoxy enones are quite useful building blocks in organic chemistry. The existing methods for syntheses of these compounds remain somewhat limited. Over the past years, nucleophilic phosphine catalysis has emerged as a practical and powerful tool for constructing diverse molecules with the advantages of environmental&#8208;friendly, metal&#8208;free, and mild reaction conditions. Meanwhile, alkynone is easy to prepare, can undergo a variety of reactions, and is a commonly used substrate for organic synthesis. &#945;&#8208;Addition of alcohols to alkynones is a direct way to construct &#945;&#8208;alkoxy enones. In this study, it was delighted to find that the employment of PPh3 (10 mmol%) and 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) (20 mmol%) could redirect from the &#946;&#8208;addition mode to &#945;&#8208;addition. With this approach, a variety of &#945;&#8208;alkoxy enones could be obtained directly with good yields and regioselectivity. Under optimal conditions, the generality of the reaction was investigated. Substrate scope studies showed that the reaction was well tolerated with many alcohols. Mechanistic study is also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe new synthetic approaches to fused 5/5/6&#8208;carbocyclic frameworks present in various polycyclic natural products such as presilphiperfolanols, lycopodium alkaloids and cyclopiane diterpenes. Our work features, a strategically introduced hydroxy group at the tert&#8208;carbon center of the tricyclic system which is present in presilphiperfolanols. In addition, one presilphiperfolanol analogue is reported to show the potential of strategies disclosed in this work. All the new compounds are characterized by high&#8208;resolution NMR spectral data. The structures of critical compounds were confirmed by various chemical transformations and further supported by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data. Overall, our approach is simple and rely on readily available starting materials, and involves a tandem&#8208;metathesis sequence. The synthetic studies disclosed here are applicable to the synthesis of natural products and to design medicinally important targets.</dc:description>

         <title>Deoxygenative Intramolecular Minisci&#8208;Type Reaction to Access Fused Heterocyclic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid build of molecular complexity is a key for the development of novel bioactive molecules. Herein we present a three&#8208;step synthetic sequence to access fused heterocyclic scaffolds from readily available starting materials, such as halogenated heteroarenes and 1,3&#8208;diols. The key step of the strategy is the development of a deoxygenative intramolecular Minisci&#8208;type reaction.







Abstract
Herein, we present a straightforward strategy for the synthesis of fused heterocycles through a deoxygenative, intramolecular Minisci&#8208;type reaction. This approach grants access to complex polycyclic scaffolds in three steps from readily available starting materials, such as chlorinated heteroarenes and 1,3&#8208;diols. The use of saccharide derivatives as the starting 1,3&#8208;diol motif allows for the synthesis of novel heterocyclic scaffolds with excellent diastereoselectivity and formal retention of configuration at the newly formed C&#8722;C bond.

         <title>In Situ Generated DBU&#8901;HF Acts as a Fluorinating Agent in a Hexafluoroisobutylation Tandem Reaction: An Effective Route to 5,5,5,5&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;Hexafluoroleucine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stereoselective synthesis of both (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;5,5,5,5&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;hexafluoroleucine mediated by DBU through a cascade reaction is reported. The pivotal role of the organic base to preserve the nucleophilicity of the fluoride released during the process is shown. The direct incorporation of the hexafluorinated side chain allows for the facile preparation of the free and suitably protected fluorinated amino acids on a multidecagram scale.







Abstract
We report the direct incorporation of the hexafluoroisobutyl group on a chiral glycine Schiff base complex mediated by 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene (DBU). The fluoroalkylation involves 2&#8208;(bromomethyl)&#8208;1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoropropane reagent, which generates in&#8197;situ hexafluoroisobutylene (HFIB), and reacts then with the enolate through a tandem allylic shift/hydrofluorination process. We showed that the use of neutral organic base DBU generates in&#8197;situ an original DBU&#8901;HF salt, which preserves the fluoride nucleophilicity and acts as a fluorinating agent. This fluoride salt promotes the hydrofluorination of the pentafluorinated alkene overcoming the usual fluoride &#946;&#8208;elimination observed with &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;vinyl reagents. With alkali metal bases, by contrast, the hydrofluorination is disfavored and the pentafluorinated alkene intermediate is obtained predominantly. This study highlights the critical role of the fluoride counter ion to preserve its nucleophilicity. The protocol is amenable to multidecagram scale synthesis of enantiopure (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;5,5,5,5&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;hexafluoroleucine and their N&#8208;Fmoc or N&#8208;Boc derivatives in good overall yield.

         <title>Synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Physovenine via Electrochemical C&#8211;O Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigated an electrochemical C&#8211;O bond formation approach to (&#177;)&#8208;physovenine. The reaction conditions are mild compared to canonical routes, which typically utilize strong hydride reagents such as lithium aluminum hydride. This enabled extension of the electrochemical cyclization to a substrate bearing the fully functionalized phenyl ring of the natural product. The electrochemical cyclization is diasetereoselective and starting from enantiopure substrate would provide a single enantiomer of physovenine. In the course of an initial formal synthesis, we identified conditions to afford modest enantioselective substrate synthesis that demonstrate the feasibility of an enantioselective synthesis. Among the substrates investigated, acetyl&#8208;, tosyl&#8208; or Boc&#8208;nitrogen substitution led to an alternative electrochemical C&#8211;O bond formation pathway where the hydroxyl nucleophile cyclized onto the aromatic ring vs. the 2&#8208;position of the indoline. This work expands the utility of electrochemical C&#8211;O bond formation and provides a foundation for further applications to functionalized cyclic ether construction.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We investigated an electrochemical C&#8211;O bond formation approach to (&#177;)-physovenine. The reaction conditions are mild compared to canonical routes, which typically utilize strong hydride reagents such as lithium aluminum hydride. This enabled extension of the electrochemical cyclization to a substrate bearing the fully functionalized phenyl ring of the natural product. The electrochemical cyclization is diasetereoselective and starting from enantiopure substrate would provide a single enantiomer of physovenine. In the course of an initial formal synthesis, we identified conditions to afford modest enantioselective substrate synthesis that demonstrate the feasibility of an enantioselective synthesis. Among the substrates investigated, acetyl-, tosyl- or Boc-nitrogen substitution led to an alternative electrochemical C&#8211;O bond formation pathway where the hydroxyl nucleophile cyclized onto the aromatic ring vs. the 2-position of the indoline.

         <title>Iodine(III)&#8208;Mediated Electrophilic Chlorination and Catalytic Nitration of N&#8208;Tosyl Anilines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient iodine(III)&#8208;based protocol for the chlorination and catalytic nitration of N&#8208;tosyl anilines as well as the proposed reaction mechanism is described. The synergistic combination of the commercially available [bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene (PIFA) with AlCl3, or (PhIO)n with Al(NO3)3, allowed the electrophilic introduction of the chlorine and nitro group in the N&#8208;tosyl aniline core in non&#8208;acidic conditions under a common strategy. Our DFT theoretical calculations, performed for the chlorination process, indicate that this occurs through a cationic pathway in which the [Cl&#8208;PhI+&#160; &#8208; OTFA&#183;AlCl3] is the chlorinating species and is formed under neutral conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Production of Imino&#8208;d&#8208;ribitol and C&#8208;Azanucleosides through Electrochemical C&#8722;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Completely stereoselective synthesis of C&#8208;azanucleosides was achieved. Assistance of the sterically hindered pentylidene acetal worked well under electrochemical conditions, and redox&#8208;induced N&#8208;&#945; hydroxylation and continuous C&#8208;glycosidation gave desired C&#8208;azanucleosides with high &#946;&#8208;selectivity (&gt;98&#8201;%).







Abstract
Herein, we report a practical method for de novo preparation of imino&#8208;d&#8208;ribitol and C&#8208;azanucleosides. The diastereopure Imino&#8208;d&#8208;ribitol was synthesized on a multigram scale by simple manipulation, and late&#8208;stage anomeric derivatization by regio&#8208; and diastereoselective electrochemical C(sp3)&#8722;H activation enabled the efficient synthesis of the corresponding C&#8208;azanucleosides with high &#946;&#8208;selectivity.

         <dc:description>Copper&#8208;catalyzed transformations of oxime ethers and sulfonyl azides were carried out to efficiently afford isoxazolidine. The reaction involved the tandem CuAAC/ring cleavage/ rare 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization procedures under mild condition. This methodology appears quite flexible and offers a capacity to generate the 2&#8208;vinyl isoxazolidine products.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;catalysed C&#8208;H Borylation of Fluoroarenes: Insights into the Balance between Steric and Electronic Control of Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The iridium catalysed C&#8208;H borylation of per&#8208; and polyfluorinated arenes and heteroarenes occurs rapidly and efficiently. As with other borylation reactions, whilst steric parameters dominate, an underlying electronic influence on reaction selectivity can be observed. Notably borylation regioselectivity in fluorinated (hetero)arenes is determined by purely electronic effects except for  ortho  &#8208;borylation between two fluorine atoms where steric effects of fluorine substituents become apparent. Borylation at the  para  position with respect to fluorine is disfavoured whereas a strong electronic preference for borylation  para  to the azinyl nitrogen of pyridine is observed. When these features co&#8208;operate high selectivity can be expected. For these reactions, computations based on transition state, rather than intermediate, energies in iridium geometries showed excellent agreement between predicted and observed selectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Assessment of the Electrochemical Synthesis Route to Silicones Starting from Silica as Feedstock</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The demand for alternatives to the industrial highly energy intensive process for the conversion of silica as feedstock to silicones led us to critically evaluate the previously described direct electrochemical pathway. We successfully achieved methylation of various SiO2 sources to cyclic methylsiloxanes via electroreduction reaction. Contrary to previous assumptions, the reaction does not start from methanol as methyl radical source, that results in methoxylation of the electrolyte solvent. Methylammonium cations were found to enable the direct conversion, strongly dependent on the radical intermediate stabilization by the electrolyte. THF / Bu4NCF3SO3 is the sole applicable system with current yields below 6% obtained so far. Mechanistic insights show that methylation does not occur via the supposed hydrolysis of dimethoxydimethylsilane intermediate, but via a direct depolymerization reaction, as comparative studies of a Fenton&#8208;type procedure clearly indicate. Further, cyclic methylsiloxane products are prone to subsequent electrochemical equilibration, strongly directed by the electrolyte solvent.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three one&#8208;pot three&#8208;step four&#8208;component reaction sequences for spiropyran synthesis have been developed, based around three different methods for in&#8208;situ generation of 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted indoles (indole N&#8208;alkylation, Fischer indolisation and indole C&#8208;alkylation), preceding common indole C&#8208;alkylation and condensation steps. The reaction sequences are complementary with respect to their substrates and conditions, hence they facilitate access to a broad swathe of spiropyran structures, and each sequence is operationally straightforward, rapid and high yielding. We have explored the scope of these highly efficient processes in the synthesis of 58 structurally diverse spiropyrans bearing a wide range of useful functional groups, and we have demonstrated their utility in the targeted synthesis of potential ratiometric fluorescence probes for metal ions and spiropyran&#8208;cholesterol conjugates as tools for cell membrane research. Finally, we have demonstrated that our one&#8208;pot N&#8208;alkylation&#8211;C&#8208;alkylation&#8211;condensation sequence can underpin combinatorial spiropyran synthesis through generation of a 16&#8208;member spiropyran library.</dc:description>

         <title>Ethynyl&#8208;Bridged Bis&#8208;Quinolinium Dyes. Studies Toward the Dependence of Different Types of Conjugation on Spectroscopic Properties.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dicationic bisquinolinium salts possessing different types of conjugation are presented in which the hetareniums are separated by acetylenic or 1,4&#8208;diethynylbenzene spacers. Cross&#8208;conjugation is induced by interconnections via the 3&#8208;positions of the heteroareniums, and conjugation is realized by 2,2/2,4/4,4&#8208;interconnections. We also synthesized mixed cross&#8208;conjugated/conjugated 2,3/4,3&#8208;interconnected species. The different types of conjugation determine the charge distribution according to the rules of resonance which translate into characteristic 13C NMR as well as UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;spectroscopic properties, LUMO geometries, and chemical properties. We found that the triple bond&#180;s resonance frequencies are sensitive 13C NMR spectroscopic indicators for the type of conjugation. Combining cross&#8208;conjugated and conjugated structure elements of dicationic bis&#8208;quinolinium dyes via triple bonds without additional benzene spacer results in considerable bathochromic shifts of the UV&#8208;Vis absorption maxima [&#916;&#955;max &#8776; 100 nm]. A charge transfer was calculated from the HOMO of the conjugated into the LUMO of the cross&#8208;conjugated partial structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt Complexes as Efficient Cooperative Catalysts for Transfer Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cobalt complexes of amide&#8208;based ligands appended with protonated heterocyclic rings are utilized as the earth&#8208;abundant catalysts for the transfer hydrogenation of assorted carbonyl compounds using isopropanol as the hydrogen source. The most successful complex illustrated remarkable catalytic performance towards a wide range of aldehydes and ketones, quantitatively yielding primary and secondary alcohols as the products, respectively.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cobalt complexes of amide-based ligands appended with protonated heterocyclic rings are utilized as the earth-abundant catalysts for the transfer hydrogenation of assorted carbonyl compounds using isopropanol as the hydrogen source. The most successful complex illustrated remarkable catalytic performance towards a wide range of aldehydes and ketones, quantitatively yielding primary and secondary alcohols as the products, respectively. The catalysis scope also included a few biologically relevant substrates such as furfural, vanillin,  ortho  -vanillin, coumarin and chalcone. The substrate binding, Hammett, kinetic and DFT studies provided the mechanistic insights.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Stereoselective Multicomponent Reactions for the Synthesis of Spiro Derivatives: Recent Progress</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spiro derivatives are important scaffolding substances found in many natural products and pharmaceuticals. In the last decade, numerous new approaches based on multicomponent reactions have been explored for the selective and efficient development of new spiro derivatives using various organocatalytic and transition metal&#8208;based catalytic systems. This review article addresses the pioneering advances in the field of catalytic stereoselective multicomponent reactions for the preparation of various spiro derivatives. These include stereoselective Michael cascade cyclization reactions, cycloadditions, diastereoselective reactions, and miscellaneous reactions for the synthesis of spiro&#8208;hetero/carbocycles. Advances in the last decade have made it possible to synthesize various spiro compounds with good to excellent stereoselectivity under appropriate reaction conditions. However, achieving high regioselectivity in several described multicomponent reactions remains a challenge. Insightful proposed catalytic mechanisms and supporting evidence are highlighted in the review. Organocatalysts and transition metal&#8208;based catalysts play a crucial role in achieving this milestone. The progress described in catalytic stereoselective approaches for spiro derivatives is immense. However, it is expected that new stereoselective synthetic methods will soon be developed that can be widely used for the preparation of spiro&#8208;heterocycles/carbocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Chemistry for Synthesis and Co&#8208;Conformational Control of Mechanically Interlocked Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanically interlocked molecules have found extensive applications in areas all across the physical sciences, from materials to catalysis and sensing. However, introducing mechanical bonds and entanglements at the molecular level is still a significant challenge due to the inherent restriction in entropy needed to preorganize strands before interlocking. Over the last decade, dynamic covalent chemistry has emerged as one of the most efficient methods of forming rotaxanes, catenanes and molecular knots. By using reversible bonds such as imines, disulfides and boronate esters, one can use the inherent error&#8208;correction in these linkages to form interlocked architectures with high fidelity and often in excellent yields. This review reports on recent advances in the use of dynamic covalent chemistry to make mechanically interlocked molecules, systematically surveying clipping, capping and templating approaches with dynamic bonds. Furthermore, it is also discussed how dynamic bonds can be used to control motion, co&#8208;conformational expression and catalytic activity in mechanically interlocked molecular machinery.</dc:description>

         <title>HBF4&#8208;Catalyzed 3,6&#8208;Bis&#8208;diarylmethylation of Carbazoles with para&#8208;Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this article, we demonstrate an atom economical, practical, mild and selective HBF4&#8208;catalyzed 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition of carbazoles to para&#8208;Quinone Methides (p&#8208;QMs) to access 3,6&#8208;bis&#8208;diarylmethyl&#8208; and mono&#8208;diarylmethyl carbazoles. This metal and additive free protocol provides a convenient access to the substituted carbazole derivatives in moderate to excellent yields with a good functional group tolerance. It was found that a couple of 3,6&#8208;disubstituted carbazoles showed interesting photophysical properties and, therefore, might potentially find some applications as host materials in OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlation between Absorption and Substitution of Photochromic 1,2&#8208;Bis(thienyl)ethenes (BTEs) Using Modified Spectroscopic Hammett Equations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Hammett&#8208;Brown substituent constants of &#945;'&#8208;substituted BTEs (open and closed) correlate linearly with the excitation energies of the absorption maxima applying the spectroscopic Hammett equation.







Abstract
Series of photochromic 1,2&#8208;bis(thienyl)ethenes possessing perfluorocyclopentene backbones, either hydrogen or methyl groups at the &#946;&#8208;positions of the thiophenes, and a variety of substituents in their &#945;'&#8208;positions were prepared, which cover the range from electron&#8208;donating to electron&#8208;withdrawing (Me, &#8722;CH2OH, &#8722;OTBS, &#8722;TMS, &#8722;Br, 1,3&#8208;dioxan&#8208;2&#8208;yl, pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl, &#8722;CH2OH, &#8722;COOH). As a linear free energy relationship the spectroscopic Hammett equation gives fair to excellent fits to the excitation energy of the absorption maxima of the ring&#8208;opened as well as the ring&#8208;closed forms of the BTEs, when Hammett substituent constants &#963;p were replaced by Brown's modified substituent constants &#963;p+ and &#963;p&#8722;. Vice versa, hitherto unknown Hammett&#8208;Brown substituent constants can be estimated from the UV spectra. Furthermore, we compared the experimentally measured absorption maxima with values which we calculated by three different methods (DFT STEOM&#8208;DLPNO&#8208;CCSD/def2&#8208;TZVPP, TD&#8208;DFT &#969;B97X&#8208;D3/6&#8208;31G*, TD&#8208;DFT &#969;B97X&#8208;D3/6&#8208;311++G**).

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox/copper catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction of 1,3&#8208;enynes, trifluoromethylaminating reagent, and TMSCN has been established. A variety of trifluoromethylaminated allenes were obtained in good yields and excellent regioselectivity.







Abstract
A photoredox/copper&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;enynes with readily available trifluoromethylaminating reagent and TMSCN was developed. This reaction proceeded at mild conditions, affording the corresponding trifluoromethylaminated allenes in good yields and excellent regioselectivity. The synthetic application of the resulting products has also been demonstrated by the transformation to N&#8722;CF3 oxazolidinones.

Aza&#8208;oxyallyl cations have garnered significant attention among the synthetic organic community as a versatile synthon for the construction of N&#8208;heterocycles. This review article provides an update of the recent developments in this area and the prevailing mechanistic insight.







Abstract
Aza&#8208;oxyallyl cations, as proposed by Sheehan in the 1960s have garnered significant attention among the synthetic organic community, owing to their diverse reactivity profile for constructing N&#8208;scaffolds of biological interest. During its initial growth, aza&#8208;oxyallyl cations were used effectively as a 3&#8208;unit synthon as 1,3 dipoles to create N&#8208;heterocycles via cycloaddition reactions, wherein aza&#8208;oxyallyl cation served as electrophilic counterpart. Recently, new variations of aza&#8208;oxyallyl cations reactivity have been reported, including its usage as a 1,4 dipole in cycloaddition reactions, domino reactions, and the unique alkylating ability of heteroatoms. This review article provides an update of the recent developments in this area and the prevailing mechanistic insight.

         <title>Electrochemical Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Azidoesterification of Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient electrochemical metal&#8208;catalyzed protocol has been developed for the azidoesterification of alkenes, providing a practical method for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acid derivatives.







Abstract
We report an efficient and sustainable electrocatalytic approach for azidoesterification of alkenes. The reaction proceeds by electrochemical iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of commercially available carbazates to produce alkoxycarbonyl radicals. Upon addition across alkenes, the generated transient carbon&#8208;centered radicals get trapped by azido metal complexes to furnish the alkene difunctionalization products. This mild, operationally simple protocol transforms a wide variety of alkenes into the corresponding &#946;&#8208;azido esters in good to excellent yields, thereby providing a practical access to &#946;&#8208;amino acid derivatives from simple and readily available starting materials.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Catalyst&#8208;Free Access to Phthalazines: Entry to Antiviral Model Drugs by Merging Domino Reactions

         <dc:description>
Light as air: A straightforward metal&#8208;free four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy to access new high&#8208;value functionalized phthalazines was developed. Combining a facile light&#8208;mediated enolization of o&#8208;methyl benzophenones/Diels&#8208;Alder reaction domino process with a subsequent deprotection/aromatization domino reaction leads to waste&#8208;reducing and cost&#8208;effective synthesis of new antiviral model drugs.







Abstract
We report the development of a metal&#8208;free four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy to access high&#8208;value functionalized phthalazines using o&#8208;methyl benzophenones as starting compounds. Combining a light&#8208;mediated enolization of o&#8208;methyl benzophenones/Diels&#8208;Alder reaction domino process with a subsequent deprotection/aromatization domino reaction in one&#8208;pot leads to sustainable and efficient organic synthesis. The tangible advantages, i.&#8201;e., absence of catalysts or additives, utilization of commercially available and/or easily accessible substrates, mild reaction conditions, simplicity, and single work&#8208;up procedure, make this combined process highly appealing for the direct construction of various 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;phthalazines. Importantly, in&#8197;vitro bioactivity evaluation of these newly prepared heterocyclic compounds demonstrated a strong antiviral efficacy against major human pathogens like HCMV and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Catalyzed Acyl&#8208;Group Exchange Reaction of Carboxylic Acids and an Aroyl Fluoride</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphine&#8208;catalyzed acyl&#8208;group exchange reaction between carboxylic acids and an aroyl fluoride has been developed. A variety of acyl fluorides are directly obtained from carboxylic acids through a catalytic system composed of tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy3) and 2,6&#8208;difluorobenzoyl fluoride as a novel deoxyfluorination reagent.







Abstract
Acyl fluorides show unique reactivity and stability, and the catalytic conversions using acyl fluorides as a divergent building block have recently attracted much attention and have been rapidly researched. Thus, a development of a new synthetic method of acyl fluorides is constantly demanded. Herein, we describe a phosphine&#8208;catalyzed acyl&#8208;group exchange reaction between carboxylic acids and an aroyl fluoride. A variety of acyl fluorides are directly obtained from carboxylic acids through a catalytic system composed of tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy3) and 2,6&#8208;difluorobenzoyl fluoride. This report is the first example of utilizing an acyl fluoride as a deoxyfluorination reagent.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical method for the oxidative rearrangement of indoles to spirooxindoles in employing an undivided, single pass flow cell is reported. The electrochemical reactions require no chemical oxidants and can be scaled up easily without need for re&#8208;optimization of reaction conditions by continuous production with parallel reactors.

The oxidative rearrangement of indoles induced by various chemical oxidants is a frequently employed method for the construction of spirooxindole structures. Herein, we report an electrochemical method for the oxidative rearrangement of indoles to spirooxindoles in continuous flow. The electrochemical reactions require no chemical oxidants and can be scaled up easily without need for re&#8208;optimization of reaction conditions by passing more starting material through parallel reactors.

         <dc:description>
Recent advances in Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective mono&#8208; and difunctionalization of alkenes, involving C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C bond formation, are discussed, highlighting the fundamental role of ligands and reaction conditions optimization. This review summarizes the significant advances made over the last years and provides tools for developing new enantioselective transformations.







Abstract
This Review summarizes the advances in the catalytic enantioselective mono&#8208; and difunctionalization of alkenes, highlighting the fundamental role of ligands. Several types of asymmetric reactions have been developed involving different bonds formation, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C, highlighting the urgency to go ahead in the search for new ligands and synthetic methodologies in order to improve the control over the reaction selectivity and activity and thus, to increase the applications in the synthesis of heterocyclic scaffolds and biologically active compounds. The Review is organized into paragraphs, which discuss the type of bond formed during the nucleopalladation, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C bonds, and the type of reaction involved.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast Continuous&#8208;Flow Photo&#8208;Thiol&#8208;Ene Functionalization of Conformation&#8208;Controlled Cinchona Alkaloids</title>

         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;fast continuous&#8208;flow photo&#8208;thiol&#8208;ene reactions on cinchona alkaloids are possible through a fine control of the reactive conformation in solution. Switching the hydroxyl group at C9 by a phenyl carbamate allows thiol&#8208;ene functionalization of cinchona alkaloids in less than 2.5&#8197;minutes with organic thiols at 32&#8201;&#176;C ant under light irradiation at 365&#8197;nm.







Abstract
In this work, we describe ultra&#8208;fast continuous flow photo&#8208;thiol&#8208;ene reactions on cinchona alkaloids derivatives through a control of the reactive conformation in solution. Flow thiol&#8208;ene reactions proceed at 32&#8201;&#176;C under light irradiation at 365&#8197;nm and require only 2.5&#8197;minutes of residence time to reach completion. The short path length of the tubular flow photochemical reactor, which maximizes and homogenizes the photon flux, associated to the fine tuning of the reactive conformation of cinchona alkaloids in solution are the main reasons for the high rates observed. The predominant conformation in solution of cinchona alkaloids was adjusted through the substitution of the hydroxyl group at C9 by a phenyl carbamate function.

         <title>Highly Selective Catalyst&#8208;Free Oxidative Synthesis of N&#8208;Formamides from C2&#8208; and C3&#8208;Feedstocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different C2&#8208; and C3&#8208;feedstocks are explored, out of these, 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone (DHA) and glyoxal (GLYOX) as carbon sources provide quantitative yields of N&#8208;formamides at optimal conditions using TBHP as oxidant with minimal carbon loss by applying a carbon source:amine ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;2. This methodology also works well on 5 gram substrate scale producing yields of N&#8208;formanilide product up to 87&#8201;%.







Abstract
The application of bio&#8208;derived feedstocks as building blocks in organic syntheses holds great value with goals of high product yield and minimizing carbon loss. As contribution to this effort, present work explores 5 different C2&#8208; and C3&#8208;feedstocks (derived from biomass and conventional sources) such as glycerol (GLY), 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone (DHA), ethylene glycol (EG), glycolic acid (GLYAC) and glyoxal (GLYOX) as carbon sources for highly selective, catalyst&#8208;free oxidative synthesis of N&#8208;formamides from primary and secondary amines. Both DHA and GLYOX showed the best carbon efficiency through carbon source: amine ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;2, resulting in 100&#8201;% selectivity of N&#8208;formanilide with tert&#8208;butyl hydrogen peroxide (TBHP) as the oxidant. GLYOX was applied further for synthesizing a N&#8208;formamide library of 21 substrates exemplifying substantial yields ranging from 68&#8211;98&#8201;%. Moreover, pilot scalability of this methodology achieved a yield of 87&#8201;% and 72&#8201;% for aniline substrate at 5&#8208;gram scale using GLYOX and DHA respectively in 24&#8197;hours.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Development and Synthesis of Carbohydrate&#8208;Based Molecules with Promising Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the potential of carbohydrates as starting materials for the synthesis of antimicrobial agents is explored. The most recent and successful reports of sugar&#8208;based bactericides, bacteriostatic agents, and adhesin binders are covered with focus on the methodologies employed in their synthesis, resulting in a useful compilation of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reactions used in carbohydrate modification.







Abstract
With the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), innovation in antibacterial drug research and development is urgently needed and strongly encouraged by the World Health Organization (WHO). Carbohydrates are valuable bioactive scaffolds to be explored in this context, and because of their unique multifunctionality, stereochemical diversity, and natural protein&#8208;binding profile, they come across as attractive starting materials for the synthesis of antimicrobial agents with innovative mechanisms of action (MoA). In this concise review, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methodologies for the synthesis of an array of promising and recently developed carbohydrate&#8208;based molecules with antibacterial activity are presented and discussed. By describing successful case studies as platforms for the scrutiny of carbohydrate modification and coupling approaches in organic chemistry, this work summarizes the latest research efforts in this area, ultimately encouraging the design and synthesis of new and much&#8208;needed glycoantibiotic leads for pharmaceutical development.

         <title>Novel Approaches To Design Glycan&#8208;Based Antibacterial Inhibitors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sweet and sticky: This review describes recent advances in the synthesis and application of homo&#8208;and heterovalent glycan&#8208;scaffolds as potential candidates for efficient bacteria lectin inhibition. To study and address the many complex molecular mechanisms involved in multivalent lectin binding events, novel glycoconjugate designs and fine&#8208;tunable glycomaterials have been developed.







Abstract
The interactions between bacterial lectins and carbohydrates on the host cell surface can mediate bacterial adhesion, invasion, and immune evasion. Multivalency plays a key role in these binding events. However, additional molecular mechanisms greatly impact multivalent binding recognition. To develop specific and effective bacterial inhibitors, a deeper understanding of the complex underlying mechanisms of bacterial adhesion processes is necessary. By interfering with bacterial adhesion, synthetic multivalent glycoconjugates do not only have the potential to improve or replace antibiotic treatments, but also represent useful tools to study carbohydrate&#8208;pathogen interactions. In this review, we highlight a few recent advances in the synthesis and application of synthetic glycan&#8208;based scaffolds to uncover the nature of glycan&#8208;bacteria interactions and to design efficient bacterial inhibitors.

         <title>Recent Developments and Trends in Asymmetric Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric organocatalysis has developed spectacularly over the last decades, and its general importance was recently highlighted by the 2021 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. This Perspective aims at providing a brief historical introduction to this field, as well as discussing selected advanced recent examples underscoring the diversity and potential of this still growing and vibrant field.







Abstract
Asymmetric organocatalysis has experienced a long and spectacular way since the early reports over a century ago by von Liebig, Knoevenagel and Bredig, showing that small (chiral) organic molecules can catalyze (asymmetric) reactions. This was followed by impressive first highly enantioselective reports in the second half of the last century, until the hype initiated in 2000 by the milestone publications of MacMillan and List, which finally culminated in the 2021 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. This short Perspective aims at providing a brief introduction to the field by first looking on the historical development and the more classical methods and concepts, followed by discussing selected advanced recent examples that opened new directions and diversity within this still growing field.

A Deep Eutectic Solvent, choline chloride/glycerol (1&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;mol&#8201;mol&#8722;1), proved to be an effective and sustainable reaction medium to promote telescoped, one&#8208;pot Mizoroki&#8208;Heck cross&#8208;coupling/reduction processes between 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran or 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran and several (hetero)aryl halides to easily access valuable 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl tetrahydrofuran (THF) or tetrahydropyran derivatives in up to 95&#8201;% yield. Notably, the whole transformation takes place under aerobic conditions, in the absence of additional ligands, and with a good substrate scope. The practicability of the method is also exemplified by the sustainable synthesis of two key THF derivatives, which are side chains of pharmacologically relevant inhibitors of Kv1.2 channel.

&lt;p&gt;Ligandless, telescoped, one-pot reductive Mizoroki-Heck reactions proceed smoothly and regioselectively in eco-friendly eutectic mixtures, and under aerobic conditions to yield 2-(hetero)aryl THF or THP derivatives in up to 95&#8201;% yield.

         <title>Stereoconvergent Synthesis of Cyclopentenyl Nucleosides by Palladium&#8208;Assisted Allylic Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stoichiometric Tsuji&#8208;Trost reaction of cyclopentenyl carbonates proceeds in stereoconvergent manner, selectively leading to cis configured nucleosides, regardless the relative configuration (cis or trans) of the starting substrates. As indicated by DFT calculations, the reaction outcome relies on the low activation energy related to the crucial, Pd&#8208;dependent &#960;&#8208;inversion step. This approach may represent a useful strategy for the synthesis of bioactive carbocyclic nucleosides.







Abstract
The Tsuji&#8208;Trost reaction of cyclopentenyl carbonates was explored by experimental studies and computational calculations, in search for the synthetic conditions enabling the stereoconvergent synthesis of cyclopentenyl nucleosides. Under common conditions, cyclopentenyl reagents provide Tsuji&#8208;Trost products only in a weakly stereoconvergent manner. However, changes in the amount of catalyst (up to 1 eq) affect either the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the reaction, selectively leading to cis configured cyclopentenyl N9&#8208;linked purine nucleosides, regardless the relative configuration (cis or trans) of the starting substrates. DFT studies clarified that this could be due to the low activation energy related to the crucial, Pd&#8208;dependent &#960;&#8208;inversion step.

         <title>Selective Electrochemical Dibromination of Terpenes and Naturally Derived Olefins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective electrochemical dibromination method of terpenes and naturally derived olefins to functional intermediates has been established using bench&#8208;stable, inexpensive sodium bromide as bromine source at carbon&#8208;based electrodes.







Abstract
A simple electrochemical protocol is established for the selective alkene dibromination of naturally derived olefins, such as terpenes. The use of hazardous Br2 or its analogues have been elegantly avoided by employing readily available, inexpensive, and harmless sodium bromide with a dual role as reagent and supporting electrolyte in combination with sustainable carbon&#8208;based electrodes. This electrochemical protocol provides the desired products with good to excellent yields up to 82&#8201;% with 10 examples. Scalability has been proved by a 5&#8208;fold scale&#8208;up. Notably, higher yields and selectivity were achieved in comparison to conventional bromination by Br2 and DMSO/HBr system and the dibrominated compound was eligible for further functionalization, such as cyanation according to the Kolbe nitrile synthesis protocol.

         <title>20&#960; Antiaromatic Isophlorins without Metallation or Core Modification
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, the synthesis of free&#8208;base (metal&#8208;free) isophlorins with 20&#960; antiaromatic character was achieved without core modification. The reduction of &#946;&#8208;tetracyanoporphyrins by hydrazine under aerobic conditions yielded isophlorins. These 18&#960; aromatic porphyrin/20&#960; antiaromatic isophlorin redox interconversions are reversible.







Abstract
Isophlorins (two&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced porphyrins) with 20&#960; antiaromaticity have been synthesized by metallation or core modification (replacing the inner NHs with less bulky atoms) thus far. The core&#8208;modification number (CMN) is an important factor for the stability of isophlorins against their oxidation to porphyrins. However, isophlorins with small CMN (&#8804;2), i.&#8201;e., without significant core modification, are difficult to synthesize and important for understanding their structure&#8211;antiaromaticity relationships. Herein, we report the synthesis of free&#8208;base (metal&#8208;free) antiaromatic isophlorins with no core modification (CMN=0) for the first time. &#946;&#8208;Tetracyanoporphyrins were successfully reduced by hydrazine to their corresponding isophlorins under aerobic conditions. These porphyrin/isophlorin transformations are reversible. Their structure and antiaromaticity were studied via 1H&#8197;NMR, UV&#8208;vis/near&#8208;infrared absorption spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction and theoretical calculations.
