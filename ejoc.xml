         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Enabling Cyanation of Electron&#8208;poor Carbons with Acetone Cyanohydrin</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Pt&#8208;cathode hydrogen evolution reaction (Pt&#8208;HER) of acetone cyanohydrin provides an alternative method for introducing the cyano group onto electrophilic carbons of imines and chalcones. The synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles and &#946;&#8208;cyano ketones has been achieved smoothly with a small excess of cyanating agent (2 equivalent), catalytic amount of supporting electrolyte and low electricity consumption (0.02 F/mol). Besides demonstrating a general atom economy, the high Faradaic efficiency, allows for a scale&#8208;up with low&#8208;demanding electrochemical design and short electrolysis times.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Decarboxylative Addition of N&#8208;Aryl Glycines to Enaminones: Access to C3&#8208;Aminomethyl Chromones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electrochemical decarboxylative addition of N&#8208;substituted glycines to enaminones has been developed and conducted under oxidant&#8208;, catalyst&#8208;, and light&#8208;free conditions in acetonitrile at room temperature by using electron as the traceless oxidant, which provided a green approach to C3&#8208;aminomethyl chromones. The resulting products were formed through radical addition/oxidation/cyclization or electrophilic addition/cyclization pathway and could act as valuable building blocks to construct polysubstituted pyrimidine derivatives.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The successful mono&#8208; and diprotonation of DAMN showed the first site of protonation to be an amino group, while the second protonation occurs at a nitrile group. The prepared salts were characterized by vibrational spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. Under strong superacidic conditions and with sufficient time cyclization of two (di)protonated molecules of DAMN is observed, yielding a tetracationic pyrazine species. Quantum chemical calculations are employed to explain reactivity and properties of compounds shown in the manuscript.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TBHP has emerged as a greener and economically viable oxygen source, radical initiator and precursor of t&#8208;BuO&#8901; and t&#8208;BuOO&#8901; radicals. It is extensively utilized as a reagent for the synthesis of epoxides, ketones, secondary alcohols, heterocyclic rings like benzofurans, isoquinoline and many more. The present review unfolds the recent advancements made in the field of TBHP&#8208;promoted C&#8722;O bond formation.







Abstract
Over past few decades, synthetic chemists are working tirelessly for the development of environmentally benign and economically competent carbon&#8208;oxygen bond formation processes. Various oxidizing reagents and catalysts are being used to serve this purpose. Among all, t&#8208;butyl hydrogen peroxide (TBHP) has emerged as a greener and economically viable oxygen source, radical initiator and precursor of t&#8208;BuO&#8901; and t&#8208;BuOO&#8901; radicals. It has been extensively utilized as a reagent for the synthesis of epoxides, ketones, secondary alcohols, heterocyclic rings like benzofurans, isoquinoline and many more. The present review will unfold the recent advancements made in the field of TBHP&#8208;promoted C&#8722;O bond formation.

         <title>Structural and Electronic Impacts of the Axial Substitution at the Phosphorus Center of C(sp3)&#8208;Bridged P&#8208;Heterotriangulenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematic functionalization of the phosphorus center in the bowl&#8208;shaped dimethylmethylene&#8208;bridged P&#8208;heterotriangulene allowed efficient modulation of its optoelectronic and structural properties. Thorough experimental and theoretical studies revealed the relationship between the s&#8208;character of the P&#8722;X bond and the bowl depth. The compounds form co&#8208;crystals with C60.







Abstract
The structural and electronic properties of the dimethylmethylene&#8208;bridged P&#8208;heterotriangulene have been systematically modulated by functionalization of its phosphorus center. The optoelectronic properties of the obtained derivatives in solution were characterized by UV/Vis absorption and emission spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and 31P NMR spectroscopy. The solid state structures were analyzed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The experimental results were corroborated by density functional theory calculations which revealed the crucial influence of the axial substitution on the bowl&#8208;shaped geometry of the phosphorus&#8208;centered polycyclic scaffold, which is proportional to the s&#8208;character of the P&#8722;X bond. The advantage of the bowl&#8208;shaped P&#8208;heterotriangulene scaffold was demonstrated by successful co&#8208;crystallization with fullerene C60.

         <title>Chiroptical Properties of a Cryptophane Soluble at Neutral pH</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anti&#8208;cryptophane&#8208;3 derivative sequesters cesium and thallium cations in aqueous solutions. This article describes the synthesis of the two enantiomers of compound 3 as well as the determination of their absolute configuration by VCD spectroscopy associated with DFT calculations. An ECD spectroscopy study assesses the ability of cesium and thallium to induce conformational changes in compound 3.







Abstract
This article reports the synthesis of the two enantiomers of a water&#8208;soluble cryptophane 3 enabling cesium and thallium complexation at neutral or basic pH. The two enantiomers of 3 were obtained in a two steps synthesis from cryptophane 4, a molecule decorated with three phenol groups and three other phenol groups protected by benzyl units. The two enantiomers of 4 were isolated from liquid chromatography using chiral stationary phase. The absolute configuration of the two enantiomers of 3 was determined by vibrational circular dichroism combined with theoretical calculations. Contrary to cryptophane 1 that present large spectroscopic changes upon cesium and thallium complexation, the electronic circular dichroism spectra of compound 3 exhibit moderate spectral changes suggesting that this compound cannot change the conformation of its linkers as easily as cryptophane 1.

         <title>Direct and Stereoselective Protecting&#8208;Group&#8208;Free N&#8208;ADP&#8208;Ribosylation through Traceless Staudinger Ligation</title>

A direct and &#945;&#8208;selective protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free N&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylation through traceless Staudinger ligation is successfully developed. The stereoselectivity of this protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free N&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylation is comfirmed by an enzymatic degradation experiment and HPLC analysis using synthetic standards. This method enables the facile and rapid synthesis of N&#8208;linked ADP&#8208;ribosyl molecules with complete &#945;&#8208;selectivity and moderate yields.







Abstract
Adenine diphosphate (ADP)&#8208;ribosylation catalyzed by bacterial toxins is the addition of an ADP&#8208;ribose moiety to specific amino acid residues in target proteins such as arginine, asparagine, glutamine, and histidine through 1,2&#8208;cis(&#945;)&#8208;glycosidic bond formation. ADP&#8208;ribosylation modifies host cell functions, altering normal cellular processes to facilitate their survival, and replication. Despite the development of click chemistry and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis&#8208;based approaches, the synthesis of structurally well&#8208;defined naturally occurring N&#8208;linked ADP&#8208;ribosyl molecules remains challenging. Herein, we report a direct and &#945;&#8208;selective N&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylation using unprotected &#946;&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosyl azide and triphenylphosphine esters through traceless Staudinger ligation. The stereoselectivity of this protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free N&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylation was validated by enzymatic degradation experiment and high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography, referencing synthetic standards. This method facilitated the facile and rapid synthesis of N&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosyl acetamide, biotin, fluorescent dye, amino acids, and tripeptide with complete &#945;&#8208;selectivity and moderate yields (37&#8211;55&#8201;%).

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Naturally Occurring Cyclic Tetrapeptide JM&#8208;47 and Analogues through Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of a Common Scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A unified approach to access the naturally occurring cyclic tetrapeptide JM&#8208;47 and some of its structural variants from a common macrocyclic scaffold has been developed. The key reactions involved a difficult macrocyclization to access the scaffold, and its late&#8208;stage diversification by cross&#8208;metathesis to access the natural product as well as analogues. The synthesis proceeded in good overall yield and high stereochemical integrity. It also confirms the structure and configuration assigned to JM&#8208;47.</dc:description>

         <title>Fusion of Cyclohepta[def]fluorene Units: Toward Synthesis of High&#8208;Spin Non&#8208;Benzenoid Nanographenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;benzenoid diradicaloids possessing high&#8208;spin ground states are attractive synthetic targets given their high potential for spintronics and quantum computing. Nevertheless, the synthesis of such compounds remains highly challenging due to their inherent instability. In this work, we present the synthetic attempt towards creating a non&#8208;benzenoid diradicaloid (1) with a triplet ground state by fusing two cyclohepta[def]fluorene units onto a benzene ring. Our synthetic approach involves both oxidation and reduction pathways. In the oxidation path, we obtained the partially dehydrogenated products 1+H and 1+2H containing an indeno[1,2&#8208;b]fluorene core from the tetrahydro precursor (2). However, further dehydrogenation to afford the target molecule (1) did not proceed. On the other hand, with the reduction pathway, a novel tetraketone precursor (9) with two pairs of pentagons and heptagons was successfully synthesized. The subsequent nucleophilic attack however was proved to be difficult probably due to the unselective nucleophilic addition on the zigzag nanographene ketones. Furthermore, UV&#8208;vis absorption, cyclic voltammetry, and theoretical calculations were conducted to explore the optical, electrochemical properties, and aromaticity of all the obtained molecules (1+H, 1+2H and 9). Although the desired target 1 is not achieved, our work provides insight into designing novel high&#8208;spin non&#8208;benzenoid NGs based on nonalternant cyclohepta[def]fluorene system.</dc:description>

         <title>2&#8208;Methylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines (2&#8208;pyNHOs): Highly Nucleophilic Enamines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high reactivity of 2&#8208;methylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines also known as 2&#8208;methylpyridinium derived N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (2&#8208;pyNHOs) has been recognized in organic synthesis, yet a quantification of their nucleophilicity is lacking. Herein we used stopped&#8208;flow photometry to determine the nucleophilicity of a series of 2&#8208;pyNHOs from the kinetics of their reactions with quinone methides and benzhydrylium ions as reference electrophiles in four organic solvents at 20 &#176;C. The kinetic data was evaluated by using the Mayr&#8208;Patz equation, lg k(20 &#176;C) = sN(N + E), which gave nucleophilicity parameters N (and sN). With N in the range of 19.4 to 21.2 (in DMSO), 2&#8208;pyNHOs exceed the reactivity of classical enamines, such as pyrrolidino&#8208;cyclopent&#8208;1&#8208;ene. The addition of 2&#8208;pyNHOs to quinone methides resulted in the formation of zwitterionic adducts with pyridinium and phenolate moieties. Subsequent tautomerization yielded entirely neutral pyridine&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ylidene&#8208;phenol species in several cases. Formation of the zwitterionic adducts from 2&#8208;pyNHOs and neutral electrophiles was almost equally fast in the polar solvents acetonitrile and DMSO, but proceeded one to two orders of magnitude slower in the less polar solvents dichloromethane or THF.</dc:description>

         <title>The Environmental Pollutant NO3&#8226; Rapidly Damages Alkene Moieties in Lipids Through Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The presence of alkene moieties in fatty acids of (phospho)lipids and cholesterol derivatives makes them highly susceptible to damage by nitrate radicals (NO3&#8226;), potentially formed through simultaneous exposure to the environmental air pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO2&#8226;) and ozone (O3). Absolute rate coefficients derived from reactions with simplified model systems range from 4 to 8 &#215; 109 M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in acetonitrile, ranking among the highest determined for NO3&#8226; reactions with biomolecules in solution to date. Alkenes featuring an electron&#8208;withdrawing carbonyl substituent also display notable reactivity with k values of (2.5 &#177; 1.0) &#215; 108 M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Calculations suggest that these reactions are initiated by oxidative electron transfer (ET) involving the C=C bond, followed by recombination of the resulting alkene radical cation with nitrate anion (NO3&#8722;) to form the nitrate adduct radical as the kinetically controlled product. Conversely, saturated fatty acid derivatives and cholestanol react with NO3&#8226; through hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with rate coefficients of 106 &#8211; 107 M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, indicating that biomolecules with a considerable number of non&#8208; or moderately activated sp3 C&#8211;H bonds are also highly susceptible to NO3&#8226; attack. These findings underscore the potential health hazards associated with exposure to combined NO2&#8226; and O3 gases.</dc:description>

         <title>Atropisomeric Properties of 5N&#8208;Benzoyl&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzodiazepin&#8208;2&#8208;ones: Substituent Effects on Rotation around the Ar&#8211;N(CO) Axis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>5N&#8208;Benzoyl&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzodiazepin&#8208;2&#8208;ones with various substituents were synthesized and their atropisomeric properties were analyzed. For the rotational isomers (E/Z) based on the amide bond [N&#8213;C(=O)], the E&#8208;isomers were preferentially formed regardless of the substituents. Atropisomers (aR/aS) due to the Ar&#8213;N(CO) (sp2&#8213;sp2) axis were isolated using chiral HPLC, and the rotational barrier (&#916;G&#8225;) in thermal isomerization was measured. The rotation barrier about the Ar&#8213;N(CO) axis was affected by both the substituents at the C6&#8208;position and the p&#8208;substituents on the benzoyl group. The substituents at C6 (R1) caused both steric and electronic effects. On the other hand, the p&#8208;substituents (R2) on the benzoyl group caused electronic effects: the electron&#8208;donating group (EDG) lowered the &#916;G&#8225; value, whereas the electron&#8208;withdrawing group (EWG) raised it. The &#916;G&#8225; values were linearly correlated with the magnitude of the electronic effect (Hammett &#963; constants) of functional groups (R2). The EDG causes an increase in the electron density on the carbonyl moiety in the amide, which may disturb the planarity of the amide bond, resulting in a decrease in the &#916;G&#8225; value.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;5N-Benzoyl-1,5-benzodiazepin-2-ones with various substituents were synthesized and their atropisomeric properties were analyzed. For the rotational isomers (E/Z) based on the amide bond [N&#8213;C(=O)], the E-isomers were preferentially formed regardless of the substituents. Atropisomers (aR/aS) due to the Ar&#8213;N(CO) (sp2&#8213;sp2) axis were isolated using chiral HPLC, and the rotational barrier (&#916;G&#8225;) in thermal isomerization was measured. The rotation barrier about the Ar&#8213;N(CO) axis was affected by both the substituents at the C6-position and the p-substituents on the benzoyl group. The substituents at C6 (R1) caused both steric and electronic effects. On the other hand, the p-substituents (R2) on the benzoyl group caused electronic effects: the electron-donating group (EDG) lowered the &#916;G&#8225; value, whereas the electron-withdrawing group (EWG) raised it.

         <title>Direct Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed&#160;C5&#8208;Arylation of 1,3,4&#8208;Oxadiazoles with Aryl Chlorides Promoted by Bis(diisopropylphosphino)ferrocene</title>

         <dc:description>The direct palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H arylation of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazoles with challenging aryl chloride substrates is promoted by the use of a specifically designed electron&#8208;rich ferrocenyl diphosphane. This protocol employs 0.5 to 1.0 mol% catalyst loading without any additives such as copper or ammonium salts, and equally tolerates electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on the (heteroaryl)aryl halides, as illustrated by the efficient synthesis in 86% yield of the anti&#8208;tubercular agent PHOXPY (2&#8208;(5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyrazine) from a late&#8208;stage arylation using 2&#8208;chloropyrazine.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Tether Length on endo/exo Stereoselectivity in Alkene&#8211;Arene meta&#8208;Photocycloaddition Reactions towards the Aphidocolin/Stemodin Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intramolecular alkene&#8208;arene meta&#8208;photocycloadditions are powerful transformations that use the enhanced reactivity of photoexcited benzene rings to facilitate addition of an alkene 1,3 across donor groups and form complex three&#8208;dimensional fused&#8208;ring systems from readily accessible starting materials. Intramolecular examples have traditionally been restricted to 3&#8208;membered tethers, with cycloaddition resulting from exo&#8208;conformation. However, by judicious tether design we have demonstrated that a 4&#8208;membered tether can also proceed in good yield; interestingly, via an endo&#8208;exciplex (1.2:1) enabling access to both natural product skeletons and interesting scaffolds for medicinal chemistry research.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Optical and Theoretical Characterization of Imidazo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines and Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines emit intense blue luminescence, suggesting their possible use as emitter molecules in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. We synthesized several new imidazo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines and found they possessed a characteristic hypsochromic effect and even increased quantum efficiency compared to the homolog imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines, as measured by UV&#8208;vis&#8208; and fluorescence spectroscopy in solution. The energies of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals were calculated using density functional theory and experimentally determined by cyclic voltammetry in solution. We obtained a maximum fluorescence quantum yield of 48% at 446 nm for the newly synthesized 3&#8208;(4&#8208;cyanophenyl)&#8208;1&#8208;(pyridyl)imidazo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline with an optimized substitution pattern. For 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridinyl)imidazo[5,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline, a quantum yield of 33% was obtained at an even shorter emission wavelength of 431 nm.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel strategy has been developed for the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;diarylindanones and 2&#8208;arylindenes through the formation of trisubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters by the ring opening of 2,3&#8208;diarylcyclopropenones in the presence ofa catalytic amount of TPP under mild reaction conditions. Initially, PPh3 activates the diarylcyclopropenone to generate the phosphonium adduct, which simultaneously reacts with 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins to afford the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters instead of Wittig olefination. Subsequently, these &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters undergo a smooth Friedel&#8208;Crafts type cyclization with arenes in the presence of AlCl3 to give a new series of 2,3&#8208;diarylindanones in good to excellent yields. Additionally, the reduction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters with NaBH4 followed by the acid catalyzed cyclization of resulting allylic alcohols afforded the 2&#8208;arylindenes in good yields. This is the first report on the use of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters as precursors for diarylindanones and arylindenes synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Topological Structural Chemistry of Fused Bicycloalkanes Allowing Homeomorphic Conversions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fused bicycloalkanes have&#160;several structures with different orientation of the substituents, such as out,out&#8208;, in,in, and in,out&#8208;structures. Some bicycloalkanes can undergo homeomorphic conversion between certain structures, for instance an out,out&#8208;structure convert to an in,in&#8208;structure. This homeomorphism can be achieved by one chain passing through the macroring. In this report, topological structural chemistry of fused bicycloalkanes and their analogues allowing homeomorphic conversions were&#160;reviewed. Although the concept of homeomorphism in fused bicycloalkanes was proposed 50 years ago, comprehensive researches on their structural chemistry are still ongoing. These understandings are highly relevant to the fundamentals of many fields of chemistry, including structural chemistry, theoretical chemistry, natural products chemistry, and materials science.</dc:description>

         <title>Multicomponent Tandem Cyclization/Aromatization Reaction: Access to 2&#8208;Substituted Naphthothiazoles and Benzothiazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A straightforward, metal&#8208;free multicomponent tandem cyclization/aromatization approach for the synthesis of naphthothiazoles and benzothiazoles has been described. This method employs &#945;&#8208;tetralone and cyclohexenones as the starting materials, styrene derivatives as a one&#8208;carbon synthon, ammonium salt as the N source, elemental sulfur as the S source, and an oxidant. This approach offers a broad substrate scope, including &#945;&#8208;tetralone and cyclohexenones adorned with different functional groups, resulting in moderate to high yields of the desired products.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Access to Tetrasubstituted N&#8208;H Pyrroles by Catalytic 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of Azomethine Ylides and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Ynones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient synthetic strategies for the preparation of tetrasubstituted N&#8208;H pyrrole derivatives, especially in an environmentally benign fashion, still remains momentous, yet challenging. Herein, we report a Cu(II)&#8208;catalyzed tandem reaction of 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;ynones and glycine iminoesters, followed by&#160;Cu(II)&#8208;promoted oxidative (air) dehydrogenative aromatization, allowing de novo access to tetrasubstituted N&#8208;H pyrroles in up to 81% yield under green reaction conditions. The possible reaction pathway is tentatively proposed. Finally, fully substituted pyrroles can be available via N&#8208;alkylation, and the preliminary phase&#8208;transfer catalytic asymmetric N&#8208;alkylation is also studied to give an axially chiral pyrrole.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Tabernanthine and Ibogaline: Rapid Access to Nosyl Tryptamines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the first total synthesis of tabernanthine and ibogaline. Entry to these iboga alkaloid natural products is enabled by a thermal coupling of indoles and aziridines to furnish the requisite nosyl tryptamine starting materials. This route features a Friedel&#8208;Crafts type alkylation to form the key indole&#8208;isoquinuclidine C&#8208;C bond. Finally, a regio&#8208; and diastereoselective hydroboration&#8208;oxidation enables C&#8208;N bond formation to close the isoquinuclidine ring system and deliver tabernanthine and ibogaline in 10 and 14% yield respectively. Both syntheses were completed in eight steps.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein we report the first syn&#8208;arylnickelative cyclisation with ketone&#8208; and imine&#8208;tethered terminal alkynes (16 examples) in yields of up to 89%. The reaction proceeds via a syn&#8208;aryl nickelation of a terminal alkyne followed by cyclisation of the resulting alkenylnickel species onto the ketone or imine. The enantioselective version of this transformation has also been explored with enantioselectivities of up to 83:17 er observed, showing that nickel complexes of Phim&#8208;type PN ligands are superior to those derived from Phox&#8208;type ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo/Electrochemical&#8208;Mediated C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Functionalization of (Thio)Ethers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the research progress of photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;mediated C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization of (thio)ethers, including alkylations, arylations, alkynylations, esterifications, thiolations, aminations, etc., is systematically reviewed.







Abstract
Molecules containing ether skeletons are widely present in drugs, natural products, functional materials, and life science. Direct C(sp3)&#8722;H bond ether functionalization is considered a powerful strategy for the construction of novel ether derivatives. Photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;chemical technology is a relatively green and sustainable synthesis method, which opens up a broad application prospect in the field of direct functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. In recent years, photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;mediated C(sp3)&#8722;H bond alkylation, arylation, alkynylation, esterification, mercaptoylation, sulfidation, and amination of ethers have been extensively studied. In this review, the research progress of photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;mediated C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization of ether compounds from 2014 to 2023 is systematically reviewed, and the scope, limitations, and mechanisms for some reactions are discussed.

         <title>Advances in Enzymatic Incorporation of Small Fluorine Modules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organofluorine compounds play a crucial role in agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and materials science. Biocatalysis has emerged as an essential strategy in the synthesis of fluorinated molecules under mild conditions. This review mainly focused on recent advances in the enzymatic synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing compounds. Furthermore, the identification of fluorinated natural products and fluorinases, the crystal structure and the directed evolution of fluorinases were discussed.







Abstract
Organofluorine compounds find extensive application in the fields of agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, materials science, and molecular imaging. Introducing fluorine atoms can provide organic compounds with unique physicochemical properties or improve their biological activity. Although significant progress has been made in the chemical synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing compounds, achieving selective fluorination under mild conditions remains extremely challenging. Introducing biocatalytic approaches in organofluorine chemistry is an important strategy given their high efficiency, selectivity, and environmental friendliness. In this review, we present the discovery of fluorinated natural products and fluorinases, the crystal structure and the directed evolution of fluorinases, with a focus on recent advances in the enzymatic synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing compounds in recent years. It is hoped that this review will help to promote the field of biocatalytic organofluorine compound synthesis.

         <title>N&#8208;Directed defluorinative &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H allylation of sulfamate esters for synthesis of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes via photoredox catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic site&#8208;selective functionalization of sulfamate esters derivatives was described. This transformation was achieved through amidyl radical directed 1,6&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer and intermolecular radical addition, providing a simple and practical approach for the synthesis of gem&#8208;difluoroalkene&#8208;containing sulfamate esters. Besides, this protocol proceeds under redox&#8208;neutral conditions.







Abstract
gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes are unique structural motifs with important applications ranging from drugs to materials. Herein, we report a novel radical&#8208;mediated defluorinative allylation of sulfamate esters with through distal C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization under photoredox conditions. The reaction could readily incorporate various gem&#8208;difluoroalkene motifs into previously unfunctionalized sp3 carbon centers. The transformation allows directly dual activation of N&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds via a photocatalytic and redox&#8208;neutral process, as well as using water as environmentally friendly co&#8208;solvent. The reaction could provide a general and operationally simple method to access gem&#8208;difluoroalkene compounds with high diversity.

         <title>Base&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Regioselective Synthesis of Bio&#8208;Based Hydroxyurethanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New furan, carvone and limonene&#8208;based carbamates have been synthesized with high regioselectivity under solvent&#8208;free and mild reaction conditions. Moreover, a detailed study on the reaction conditions allowed for the drastic reduction of the TBD loading with almost no effect on the regioselectivity.







Abstract
The regioselective synthesis of carbamates from bio&#8208;derived cyclic carbonates and amines by using 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD) as an organocatalyst is reported. This methodology led to the preparation of a wide range of bio&#8208;sourced hydroxyurethanes from furan&#8208;, carvone&#8208; and limonene&#8208;based scaffolds under solvent&#8208;free and mild reaction conditions. Moreover, a comprehensive analysis of the process allowed us to optimize the catalyst loading with little or no impact on the process regioselectivity.

         <title>Photochemical Trifluoromethylative Difunctionalization of Styrenes and Phenylacetylenes via a Catalytic EDA Platform</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic EDA platform for the photochemical trifluoromethylative difunctionalization of styrenes and phenylacetylenes is developed. This three&#8208;component transformation unveils a new reactivity mode of trifluoromethyl thianthrenium triflate (TT&#8208;CF3+OTf&#8722;) promoted by dithiocarbamate donors, further enhancing its synthetic versatility.







Abstract
Herein we report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced trifluoromethylative difunctionalization of styrenes and phenylacetylenes using trifluoromethyl thianthrenium triflate (TT&#8208;CF3+OTf&#8722;). The transformation was enabled by the discovery of a photoactive catalytic EDA complex formed between carbazolyl dithiocarbamate and TT&#8208;CF3+OTf&#8722;. This three&#8208;component reactivity platform establishes a new paradigm for TT&#8208;CF3+OTf&#8722;, significantly expanding its repertoire of photochemically enabled trifluoromethylation reactions.

         <title>Synthesis of a Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane&#8208;Containing Aromatic Lipoxin B4 Analogue and Heteroaromatic Congeners</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the asymmetric synthesis of an aromatic analogue of lipoxin B4 containing a conformationally rigid and potentially more metabolically resistant bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) ring incorporated into the upper alkyl chain. This was achieved via the design of a key BCP&#8208;containing fragment that could be used as a common intermediate in the synthesis of the target analogue as well as other heteroaromatic congeners.







Abstract
Lipoxins are pro&#8208;resolving mediators that play an important role in the resolution phase of the innate inflammatory response. However, because of their chemical and metabolic instability, the design of more stable synthetic analogues of lipoxin A4 and lipoxin B4 is an ongoing area of study. Herein we report the asymmetric synthesis of an aromatic lipoxin B4 analogue containing a conformationally rigid and potentially more metabolically resistant bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) ring incorporated into the upper alkyl chain. This was achieved by the development of a 9&#8208;step chiral&#8208;pool synthesis of a novel BCP&#8208;containing boronic ester coupling partner which could serve as a common precursor to the target analogue as well as other analogues with further modifications to the aromatic core.

         <title>Dielectrophilic Approach to Sequential Heterofunctionalization of Ethylene from Vinylthianthrenium Salt</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vinylthianthrenium salt was employed as the starting material for a formal difunctionalization of ethylene. Its 1,2&#8208;dielectrophilic property enables the sequential incorporation of two distinct nucleophiles onto ethylene. Through this method, we achieve the formation of a C&#8722;C bond and a C&#8722;X bond (X=N, O, halogen) on ethylene, in a single step performed under mild conditions.







Abstract
Vinyl thianthrenium salt is a compound with interesting electrophilic properties capable of reacting with two distinct nucleophiles. By using &#946;&#8208;keto esters as one of the reaction partners, it is possible to insert a chain of two carbon atoms with a further functionalization under mild conditions. We have studied this new methodology which involves the stepwise formation of a C&#8722;C and a C&#8722;X bond (with X=N, O, etc.) in one step without the use of metals. Depending on the reaction conditions and the starting ketoester, a varied reactivity has been observed and described.

Depending on the reaction conditions and the starting ketoester, a varied reactivity has been observed and described.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A mini review focused on the chemistry of selenosulfones reported since 2019 is here presented. Initially, methods aimed to the preparation of such moiety are discussed. Successively 1,2&#8208;, 1,3&#8208;, 1,4&#8208; and 1,7&#8208;addition reactions to C&#8208;C single and multiple bonds are illustrated. The third chapter deals with C&#8208;H functionalizations while the fourth one shows the reactions with aryl diazonium salts or its precursors. The radical coupling with redox active reagents, is the subject of section five. Selenosulfones challenged in nucleophilic substitutions and in reactions with phosphorus&#8208;containing compounds are shown in chapter six and seven followed by the conclusions and perspectives section.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidating the Key Factors in Hydroamination and Defluoroamination Competitions: A DFT Analysis of Reaction between &#945;&#8208;(Trifluoromethyl)styrene and 2&#8208;Pyridones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual reactivity of key intermediates &#946;&#8208;fluorocarbanions leads to hydroamination versus defluoroamination in reactions between &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)styrenes and 2&#8208;pyridones. The competition between defluorination and protonation is mainly influenced by the sources of protons. Consequently, the pKaH values may serve as reliable indicators for predicting the most favorable reaction pathway.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;fluorocarbanions have garnered considerable attention for their dual reactivity in nucleophilic processes and &#946;&#8208;fluorine elimination. In this study, a thorough computational analysis was conducted to explore the reactions of &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)styrenes with 2&#8208;pyridones to delineate the factors determining protonation or defluorination pathways for the in&#8197;situ generated &#946;&#8208;fluorocarbanions under varied basic conditions. Our findings illuminate the critical role of organobase basicity in steering the direction of the competitive protonation and &#946;&#8208;fluorine elimination reactions. We propose the use of pKaH values of organobases as a quantitative indicator for discerning the predominant reaction pathways. This provides an efficient approach to predict and control the reaction outcome, facilitating the deliberate design of reactions to leverage the unique reactivity of &#946;&#8208;fluorocarbanions in the realm of fluorine chemistry.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method has been developed to achieve for addition&#8208;ring opening cascade reaction, according a series of aza&#8208;bicyclic maleimide derivatives with good yields and diastereoselectivities.







Abstract
An efficient method has been developed to facilitate the addition&#8208;ring opening cascade reaction of vinylogous oxindole, resulting in the synthesis of a variety of aza&#8208;bicyclic maleimide derivatives with high yields and exceptional diastereoselectivities. Furthermore, the product could be effectively and easily transformed into the difluoromethylenecyclohexane skeleton through a dehydrofluorination process. This methodology demonstrates significant potential for the synthesis of aza&#8208;bicyclic maleimide skeleton, which possesses biological or pharmaceutical activity.

         <title>Heteroaryl 2&#8208;Sulfonamide Synthesis by SN2 Reaction&#8211;Oxidation Cascade</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient SN2&#8208;oxidation cascade reaction for synthesizing heteroaryl 2&#8208;sulfonamides from disulfanes and amines is described. The methodology has broad scope, affording heteroaryl 2&#8208;sulfonamides in moderate to good yields, and was applied to the synthesis of H3B&#8208;968, a potential Werner Syndrome Protein (WRN) small molecule inhibitor.







Abstract
Heteroaryl 2&#8208;sulfonamides are an important structural moiety in drug discovery. However, reports of the efficient synthesis of these scaffolds are rare. Herein we disclose new reaction conditions to synthesize heteroaryl 2&#8208;sulfonamides from disulfanes and amines through an SN2&#8208;oxidation cascade. The approach is compatible with a wide variety of heteroaryl and amine substrates and can be conducted on a gram scale. A potential Werner Syndrome Protein (WRN) small molecule inhibitor H3B&#8208;968 was also synthesized by this method.

         <title>Decatungstate&#8208;Catalyzed Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Formation Between Furfural and Electron&#8208;Deficient Olefins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 16, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalization of furfural can be achieved by photocatalytic C&#8722;H activation of the aldehyde and coupling to electron&#8208;deficient olefins. With (Bu4N)4W10O32 as the photocatalyst, furfural can be added to benzylidene malononitriles, acrylates, itaconic anhydride, maleic anhydride, 2&#8208;vinylpyridine and phenyl vinyl sulfone to form the corresponding furanyl ketones in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields.







Abstract
Furfural is produced on a large commercial scale from lignocellulose and can be used for the preparation of several industrial chemicals with four to five carbon atoms. Further functionalization of furfural by C&#8722;H activation, however, is less widely developed. In the present work, tetrabutylammonium decatungstate is investigated as an inexpensive photocatalyst for activating the aldehyde C&#8722;H bond and mediate a coupling between furfural and electron&#8208;deficient olefins. The results show that furfural can be successfully added to benzylidene malononitriles, acrylates, itaconic anhydride, maleic anhydride, 2&#8208;vinylpyridine and phenyl vinyl sulfone to generate the corresponding furanyl ketones in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields. The electronic properties of the electron&#8208;deficient olefins are instrumental for achieving a favorable reaction with furfural. The findings show how photocatalysis can be used to form new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds from a platform molecule, which in this way can be converted into a number of more advanced structures.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Regioselective Chlorosulfenylation of Indoles by Dimethylsulfoxide and 1,2&#8208;Dichloroethane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 16, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and cost&#8208;effective metal&#8208;free method for vicinal Csp2&#8722;H difunctionalization of indole was reported. The common solvents dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dichloroethane (DCE) were used as precursor to generate chlorodimethylsulfonium ion for electrophilic methylthiolation followed by chlorination by enabling 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;methylthioindoles.







Abstract
Direct chloromethylthiolation of the C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds of indole was achieved with the commonly used solvents dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dichloroethane (DCE). Initially, chlorodimethylsulfonium ion is generated in&#8197;situ from the reaction of DMSO and DCE on simple heating at 120&#8201;&#176;C and is used for electrophilic methylthiolation followed by chlorination, enabling the synthesis of 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;methylthioindoles.

         <title>Selective Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Dimerization of Styrenes and Acrylates in Molten Tetrabutylammonium Acetate as an Ionic Liquid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 16, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective dimerization of styrenes and acrylates was possible with a very low amount of palladium acetate in molten tetrabutylammonium acetate. The coupling of substituted vinyl arenes gave exclusively the (E,E)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diarylbutadiene motif within 7&#8211;10 h, whereas butyl acrylate was converted into dibutyl 2&#8208;methyleneglutarate in less than 2 h. The catalytic pathways involved in the two processes were elucidated along with the role of the ionic liquid.







Abstract
A method for the selective dimerization of styrenes and acrylates has been developed. The reaction is catalyzed by a very low amount of palladium acetate in molten tetrabutylammonium acetate without the need for any additional ligand. The use of this method enabled the coupling of substituted vinyl arenes in reasonable yields to give exclusively the (E,E)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diarylbutadiene motif within 7&#8211;10 h. Acrylates, on the other hand, exhibit higher reactivity, and the use of dibutyl acrylate resulted in the quantitative synthesis of dibutyl 2&#8208;methyleneglutarate in less than 2 h. This selectivity is unprecedented in the literature. The role of the ionic liquid and the different catalytic pathways involved in the two processes were also elucidated.

The reaction is catalyzed by a very low amount of palladium acetate in molten tetrabutylammonium acetate without the need for any additional ligand. The use of this method enabled the coupling of substituted vinyl arenes in reasonable yields to give exclusively the (E,E)-1,4-diarylbutadiene motif within 7&#8211;10 h. Acrylates, on the other hand, exhibit higher reactivity, and the use of dibutyl acrylate resulted in the quantitative synthesis of dibutyl 2-methyleneglutarate in less than 2 h. This selectivity is unprecedented in the literature. The role of the ionic liquid and the different catalytic pathways involved in the two processes were also elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nitration of Pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines with NaNO2/HFIP</title>

A mild nitration of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines has been reached in a NaNO2/HFIP reaction system.







Abstract
A mild nitration of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines has been reached using sodium nitrite as nitro source in HFIP at ambient temperature. A variety of nitro&#8208;bearing pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline derivatives has been efficiently prepared in poor to quantitative yields (28&#8211;98&#8201;%). These products can be easily transformed to primary amines and amide by simple chemical reactions. Treatment of other nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles such as pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoline and substituted indoles under this developed reaction system afforded nitro&#8208;bearing N&#8208;heterocycles in relatively lower yields (15&#8211;19&#8201;%).

         <dc:description>
N&#8208;terminal guanidinylated resin&#8211;supported helical peptides were found to catalyze the kinetic resolution of a planarly chiral 4&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrovinyl)[2.2] paracyclophane via asymmetric Michael addition with an s&#8208;factor reaching up to 111.







Abstract
Kinetic resolution of 4&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrovinyl)[2.2]paracyclophane based on N&#8208;terminal&#8211;guanidinylated resin&#8211;bound helical peptide catalyzed asymmetric Michael addition of malonate esters was developed. This approach provides a new pathway to enantiopure paracyclophane derivatives characterized by both planar and central chirality, along with the recovery of the chiral substrate with a selectivity factor of up to 111. Additionally, the synthetic potential of the resulting products has been showcased through their successful transformation into derivatives of &#946;&#8208;substituted &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid.

         <title>Decarboxylative Amination of SMAHOs by Dialkyl Azodicarboxylates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 16, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organocatalyzed decarboxylative addition of substituted malonic acid half oxyesters (SMAHOs) to dialkyl azodicarboxylates led to the formation of &#945;&#8208;aminoester derivatives. The reaction can be performed under mild reaction conditions using 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) as a catalyst and displayed a rather important scope.







Abstract
The decarboxylative addition of substituted malonic acid half oxyesters (SMAHOs) to dialkyl azodicarboxylates is described. The reaction was promoted by 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) as an organocatalyst in heated toluene. High yields of the coupling products were generally obtained, and the scope of the reaction proved rather important with the potential presence of functionalized side chains at the &#945;&#8208;position, affording an original access to &#945;&#8208;aminoester derivatives.

         <title>Yttrium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydroamination of Norbornene with Simple Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 16, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydroamination of norbornene with simple amines remains a major challenge. Now the hydroamination of norbornene with such simple amines is reported, as well as the first rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of norbornenes.







Abstract
The intermolecular hydroamination of norbornene with simple amines was achieved using silyl&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;terphenoxide yttrium complexes. Excellent conversion was obtained for both benzylic and aliphatic amines. For benzyl and linear aliphatic amines, the highest activity was observed for the sterically more encumbered methyldiphenylsilyl&#8208;substituted complex, whereas the trimethylsilyl&#8208;substituted complex was more active for sterically encumbered primary amines.

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Catalyzed 1,6&#8208;Addition and Tandem Addition/Self&#8208;Aldol Condensation Reactions of Para&#8208;Quinone Methides with Thiols</title>

         <dc:description>
Phosphine&#8208;catalyzed chemodivergent reactions of p&#8208;QMs have been developed. The direct 1,6&#8208;addition of p&#8208;QMs with thiols was catalyzed by P(4&#8208;FC6H4)3, while P(4&#8208;MeC6H4)3 catalyzed the tandem addition/self&#8208;aldol condensation reactions of p&#8208;QMs with 1,4&#8208;dithiane&#8208;2,5&#8208;diol. Furthermore, one of the products diarylmethyl thioether was shown to have an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of all cancer cell types in the study.







Abstract
Phosphine&#8208;catalyzed chemodivergent reactions of para&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) affording a wide variety of diarylmethyl thioether derivatives have been reported. In the transformation presented in this work, P(4&#8208;FC6H4)3 catalyzed the direct 1,6&#8208;addition of p&#8208;QMs with thiols, whereas P(4&#8208;MeC6H4)3 promoted the tandem addition/self&#8208;aldol condensation reactions of p&#8208;QMs with 1,4&#8208;dithiane&#8208;2,5&#8208;diol. Moreover, some of the obtained products were screened against cancer cell lines HepG2, NB4, and K562, and one was found to inhibit the proliferation of all the tested cancer cell types.

         <title>cis&#8208;Linked Cyclotetraphenylenes: Synthesis, Structures and Fluorescence Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 16, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two cis&#8208;connected cyclic tetraphenylethylenes, [2]c&#8208;CTPE and [3]c&#8208;CTPE, were synthesized by platinum&#8208;mediated cyclization. The strain energy of [2]c&#8208;CTPE is up to 86.28&#8197;kJ&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1. [2]c&#8208;CTPE and [3]c&#8208;CTPE demonstrates typical Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) characteristics. Moreover, both [2]c&#8208;CTPE and [3]c&#8208;CTPE display mechanofluorochromic properties.







Abstract
cis&#8208;Linked cyclotetraphenylene dimer [2]c&#8208;CTPE and trimer [3]c&#8208;CTPE were synthesized via Pt&#8208;mediated cyclization of cis&#8208;diboronated tetraphenylethene. The structure of [2]c&#8208;CTPE has been confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The strain energy of [2]c&#8208;CTPE and [3]c&#8208;CTPE was calculated to be 86.28&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;kJ mol&#8722;1 and 9.23&#8197;kJ&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively. [2]c&#8208;CTPE and [3]c&#8208;CTPE are typical AIEgens and show mechanofluorochromic properties. The comparisons of cis&#8208;linked cyclotetraphenylenes with gem&#8208;linked cyclotetraphenylenes were also discussed.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Urea&#8208;, Thiourea&#8208;, and Isothiourea&#8208;Based Bifunctional Tetraarylphosphonium Salt Catalysis for Conversion of Carbon Dioxide to Cyclic Carbonates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 16, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the development of bifunctional organocatalysts for the reaction of epoxides with atmospheric pressure of carbon dioxide. Isothiourea, thiourea, and urea groups are effective hydrogen bond donors for the carbon dioxide fixation. Computational mechanistic studies disclosed key hydrogen bond interactions between catalysts and intermediates, which relied upon orientation of the binding modes.







Abstract
A novel bifunctional isothiourea derived from a tetraarylphosphonium salt catalyzes the coupling reaction of monosubstituted epoxides with 1&#8197;atm of carbon dioxide to afford five&#8208;membered cyclic carbonates in high yields. Thiourea and urea groups are also effective hydrogen bond donors for the carbon dioxide fixation. Comprehensive mechanistic studies on this catalysis using theoretical calculations disclosed key hydrogen bond interactions between catalysts and intermediates, which relied upon orientation of the binding modes.

         <title>Polyhalogenated Carbohydrates: Synthesis and Applications of Sugar Halides from Fluorine to Iodine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 16, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The societal importance of sucralose (a trichlorinated disaccharide) doesn't fade over time. This review focuses on the synthesis and applications of polyhalogenated carbohydrates incorporating fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine atoms. An overview of the current state of the art of sugar inter&#8208;halides is also presented.







Abstract
Polyfluorinated carbohydrates have attracted attention in the last decades. This is due to the interesting properties of such organofluorines. What about the other halogens? Since the discovery of sucralose (a trichlorinated disaccharide) more than 50&#8197;years ago, only a handful of chlorinated, brominated, or iodinated carbohydrates have been reported. This review focuses on the synthesis of polyhalogenated carbohydrates, including sugar inter&#8208;halides, but excluding polyfluorinated sugars. An overview of the current state of the art of their potential application is also described.

         <dc:description>A synthesis of amides from aldehydes promoted by the photoactive complex of Fe2SO4 with 2&#8208;picolinic acid, NaCl as chlorine source, Na2S2O8 as a benign oxidant is reported. The reaction is mediated by visible&#8208;light and is carried out at room temperature in absence of additives. Fe2SO4 is a readily available earth&#8208;abundant metal (EAMs) salt, not needed to be prepared and is environmentally sustainable. Both aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes and mono&#8208; and disubstituted amines have been texted in this transformation. This report opens intriguing perspectives for extendeding application of photoactive complex iron salts toward halogenation processes as well as for C&#8208;H activations and gives a contribution to the field of earth&#8208;abundant metals based&#8208;catalysis.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A multicomponent Kr&#246;hnke reaction route toward 2&#8208;trifluoromethyl pyridines from reaction of chalcones with easily available and stable 1&#8208;(3,3,3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxopropyl)pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium&#160;bromide and ammonium acetate is reported.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Based Deep Eutectic Solvents: Key Players for Amide and Sulfonamide Synthesis and Alcohol Oxidation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A sustainable protocol has been devised for the oxidation of activated secondary alcohols to their corresponding carbonyl compounds, as well as their utilization as selective mono&#8208;alkylating reagents for both amide and arylsulfonamide derivatives. These reactions proceed smoothly and in good yields (up to 98%) when conducted in Fe&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents (DESs), which serve dual roles as solvents and catalysts. Operating under mild (40 &#176;C) and aerobic conditions, these transformations are completed within a 4 h time frame. A pharmacologically relevant amide derivative, specifically a PMRT1 inhibitor, has also been successfully synthesized on a 3 g&#8208;scale utilizing a reusable FeCl3&#183;6H2O/glycerol Lewis acidic DES.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymorphism and White Light Emission of 1&#8208;Bromo&#8208;3,5,7&#8208;triphenyladamantane Compared with 1,3,5,7&#8208;Tetraphenyladamantane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted diamondoid polymorphs were identified and show different white&#8208;light emission spectra upon continuous infrared laser irradiation. The polymorphicity arises from a competition of London dispersion interactions either as short CH&#8211;&#960; or Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br contacts.







Abstract
Here we report our investigation of 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,5,7&#8208;triphenyladamantane (1) and the elucidation of polymorphic crystals (1&#8201;A and 1&#8201;B) using single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. In the monoclinic crystal system of 1&#8201;A (P21/n), we observed CH&#8211;&#960; interactions, while Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br interactions are absent. Conversely, the Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br interactions are an apparent factor in the formation of the monoclinic crystal system of 1&#8201;B (R
). We compare our findings with 1,3,5,7&#8208;tetraphenyladamantane (2), characterized by numerous CH&#8211;&#960; interactions in the solid. Computational analyses were employed to investigate the interactions within the characteristic dimers present in the unit cells of 1&#8201;A and 1&#8201;B, including visualization of noncovalent interactions and the use of the atoms&#8208;in&#8208;molecules approach as well as MO analyses. These support the notion of London dispersion (LD) dimer&#8208;dimer interactions in 1&#8201;A between the phenyl moieties, whereas 1&#8201;B exhibits additional dimer&#8208;dimer Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br contacts. In contrast, the crystals of 2 are exclusively held together by CH&#8211;&#960; stacking LD interactions, a feature absent in the polymorphs of 1. Both polymorphic forms of 1 emit white light when subjected to 900&#8197;nm continuous wave laser irradiation, displaying a subtle blue shift compared to 2. The absence of CH&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions between the dimers of 1 causes a small red&#8208;shift in the emission spectrum.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free tandem carbonyl reduction and hydrodefluorination of b&#8208;trifluoromethyl enones with hydrosilanes was developed for the synthesis of a variety of valuable gem&#8208;difluorovinyl alcohols. The hydrosilane could act as both a reductive agent and a C(sp3)&#8208;F bond&#8208;breaking promotor under mild reaction conditions. Synthetically useful organofluorides, such as gem&#8208;fluorophosphine alkene, gem&#8208;difluorovinyl ketone, and fluorinated dihydrofuran derivatives could be constructed by the further transformations of the obtained gem&#8208;difluorovinyl alcohols. Moreover, the method features operationally simple, excellent functional group tolerance, mild reaction conditions, and scalability.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Noncoded Amino Acids Bearing a Salicylaldehyde Tag for the Design of Reversible&#8208;Covalent Peptides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Insertion of electrophilic species on the structure of small molecule ligands or peptides is a well&#8208;known strategy to increase their binding affinity for the target protein of interest. Among these reactive units, the salicylaldehyde (SA) tag can form remarkably stable imine bonds with the &#949;&#8208;amino group of lysine, a highly frequent residue in proteins. In this work, we describe the optimized synthesis of two new noncoded &#945;&#8208;amino acids, starting from l&#8208;homoserine and featuring the SA tag on the side chain. One of these final compounds was successfully inserted into a model tripeptide through in&#8208;solution synthesis. These building blocks will allow the versatile insertion of the SA tag at suitable position of peptide sequences, opening to a tailored design of Lys&#8208;engaging peptide ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Effects of a Larger N&#8208;Heterocyclic Ring in Rofecoxib Analogues on AIE Activity and Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two AIE&#8208;active analogues, 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF and 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF, with different N&#8208;heterocyclic rings were synthesized. Compound 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF with a larger N&#8208;heterocyclic ring showed an increase in the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) by a factor of around 10 in the solid as well as more multifunctional applications, such as mechanochromism, acidochromism, and lipid droplets imaging ability.







Abstract
Two analogues of rofecoxib, 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF and 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF, were designed according to the strategy of heterocyclic ring enlargement and facilely synthesized in a facile manner by Knoevenagel reactions. The first compound, 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF, had low quantum yields (QY) of 3.0&#8201;% in the solid states. After replacing the pyrrolidinyl with piperidinyl, the resulting 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF had a significantly increased QY, with a value of 28&#8201;%. The root&#8208;mean&#8208;square deviation (RMSD) values between S0 and S1 of 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF and 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF in tetrahydrofuran were 0.51, 0.35&#8197;&#197;, respectively. As compared with 2&#8208;Pyr&#8208;ROF, compound 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF exhibited a smaller RMSD, which indicated a lower non&#8208;radiative transition rate. A single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study and Hirshfeld surfaces analysis revealed that 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF had a more nonplanar molecule structure and a weaker &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction, which might result in a higher fluorescence intensity and QY. Owing to its better aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior, compound 2&#8208;Pip&#8208;ROF showed more multi&#8208;functional applications, including mechanochromism, acidochromism, and lipid droplets imaging ability. These results imply that the strategy of heterocyclic ring enlargement provides a new paradigm for the design of new luminogens with AIE properties.

         <title>Exploring the Reactivity of Melanins as Photocatalysts for Reductive Dehalogenations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reductive dehalogenation of &#945;&#8208;halogenated carbonyl compounds has been performed by exploiting four different melanin polymers in the role of photocatalyst. The reaction smoothly took place under visible light irradiation in the presence of sodium ascorbate as an additive. The melanin obtained from 5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole 2&#8208;carboxylic acid offered the best performance, especially in the reduction of brominated substrates.







Abstract
Four melanin polymers prepared from different precursors (5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole, 5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole 2&#8208;carboxylic acid, 1,8&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene and dopamine) have been adopted as photocatalysts in the reductive dehalogenation of a series of model &#945;&#8208;halogen carbonyl derivatives. The best performing melanin was that obtained from 5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole 2&#8208;carboxylic acid, which allowed to dehalogenate efficiently both bromomalonate esters and phenacyl bromide; on the other hand, chloromalonate esters were almost unreactive under the same reaction conditions. Electrochemical and control experiments enabled to elucidate the reaction mechanism, demonstrating the key role of electrons as charge carriers in the observed photocatalytic process.

         <dc:description>
Visible light mediated tandem oxidation&#8211;organo catalyzed C&#8722;S bond functionalization protocol for the cleavage of aromatic C&#8722;S bond. The investigation encompassed the functionalization of C&#8722;S bonds within sulfones, sulfoxides, and aliphatic sulfide derivatives. However, the process of functionalizing the C&#8722;S bond in aromatic sulfides remains uncertain. The presented protocol demonstrates the C&#8722;S bond functionalization on benzo[b]benzo[4,5]thieno[2,3&#8208;d]thiophene derivative and amines including primary and secondary amines as well.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;free Chloroamination Cyclization Cascade with Sodium Hypochlorite: from N&#8209;(Pentenyl)sulfonylamides to 2&#8209;(1&#8208;Chloromethyl)pyrrolidines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A mild and catalyst&#8208;free protocol to obtain several 2&#8208;chloromethylpyrrolidines by the use of a commercial solution of sodium hypochlorite is here reported, without the need for a light source. The choice of the solvent revealed to be crucial in the success of the reaction. Mechanistic studies, both experimental and computational, confirmed a radical mechanism, where the deprotonation step, followed by the oxidation of a N&#8208;centered anion to the corresponding radical, allowed 2&#8208;chloromethylpyrrolidines, by a very fast cyclization, to be obtained. Sodium hypochlorite plays the role of both the oxidant and the chlorine source.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationships of Glucose&#8208;based PdII&#8208;Bis(NHC) Complexes in a Model Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The authors of this work have optimized a novel synthetic route towards glucose&#8208;based PdII&#8208;bis(NHC) complexes in only 4 steps with total yields up to 73&#160;%. The synthesis route encompasses an Appel reaction towards 6&#8208;iodo&#8208;glucopyranosides, followed by acyl&#8208;protection, then quaternization with imidazoles and finally the conversion of these acyl&#8208;protected glucosyl imidazolium salts to their respective palladium(II)bis(NHC) complexes, via an intermediary silver(I) complex. Overall, 11 acyl&#8208;protected glucosyl imidazolium iodides as NHC&#8208;precursors and 15 complexes have been synthesized. The structure&#8208;activity relationships of different functionalizations in these complexes and their reactivity in a model Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura between bromobenzene and 4&#8208;tolueneboronic acid reaction has been investigated, and a highly reactive complex leading to &gt;99&#160;% yield at 0.005&#160;mol% catalytic loading has been found.</dc:description>

         <title>SO2F2&#8208;Mediated Thioesterification of Carboxylic Acids with Thiols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article described the thioesterification of carboxylic acids with thiols through the activation of sulfonyl fluoride (SO2F2). The presented one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step protocol was compatible with aryl/alkyl carboxylic acid including drug molecules.







Abstract
The generation of thioesters through thioesterification of carboxylic acid has significant synthetic value given the easy availability of various carboxylic acids and the extensive application of thioesters. An economical and rapid thioester synthesis approach is still needed. Herein, we achieved thioesterification of carboxylic acids with valuable glycosyl thiol, aromatic and aliphatic thiols mediated by sulfonyl fluoride (SO2F2). The compatibility of numerous carboxylic acid substrates was tested, including (hetero)aromatic and aliphatic carboxylic acids and the reaction proceeded smoothly under mild conditions at good yields. Late&#8208;stage modification of drug molecules rac&#8208;Naproxen and Loxoprofen proved feasible. Besides, the gram&#8208;scale reaction demonstrated the utility of this protocol.

         <title>Synthesis and Application of Well&#8208;Defined Fluoroalkyl Zinc Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluoroalkyl groups play an irreplaceable role in the field of pharmaceutical and agrochemical industry due to their unique properties. Based on this, it is crucial to effectively introduce fluoroalkyl groups into target molecules. In this review, we describe the synthesis of well&#8208;defined fluoroalkyl zinc complexes and their applications in the fluoroalkylation of compounds. Different from the reactivities of copper fluoroalkyl complexes, fluoroalkyl zinc complexes often needed to be combined with copper or nickel catalysts when participating in fluoroalkylation reactions. From the perspective of reaction mechanism, the transfer of trifluoromethyl from zinc complexes to copper catalysts formed the highly active trifluoromethyl copper reagents, which can be directly used for the fluoroalkylation. In most cases, the desired target products were provided with excellent yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigations on Superbase Mediated Reactivity of N&#8208;Tosylhydrazones with Aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;Quinone Methide Precursors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigations were made on the chemoselectivity in superbase&#8208;mediated reactions of N&#8208;tosylhydrazones with aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide precursors. Under super basic conditions, the reaction of N&#8208;tosylhydrazone with ortho&#8208;aminobenzyl afforded 2&#8208;substituted quinoline while the reaction of former with N&#8208;(2&#8208;(chloromethyl)phenyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylbenzenesulfonamide furnished azine sulphonamides.







Abstract
We have encountered a superbase&#8208;mediated chemoselective reaction of N&#8208;tosylhydrazones with aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide precursors. When tosylhydrazone was treated with ortho&#8208;aminobenzyl alcohol in super basic conditions (KOH+DMSO), we observed the formation of 2&#8208;substituted quinoline. The reaction was found to be general, and by this method, mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted quinolines could be made. We could prove experimentally and theoretically that the reaction proceeded via the formation of an azine from the basic decomposition of N&#8208;tosylhydrazones. Finally, the reaction of tosylhydrazone with N&#8208;(2&#8208;(chloromethyl)phenyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylbenzenesulfonamide (aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide precursor) under super basic conditions afforded hydrazine substituted sulfonamides.

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed One&#8208;Pot Multi&#8208;Step Synthesis of N&#8208;Polyheterocycles from Nitroarenes and Glycols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem process for the synthesis of N&#8208;polyheterocycles from easily available nitroarenes catalyzed by a dioxomolybdenum(VI) complex is described, where the byproduct generated in the first step is incorporated into the final structure. A broad variety of nitrogenated compounds are synthesized in overall good yields in a one&#8208;pot manner.







Abstract
We report the efficient, sustainable one&#8208;pot synthesis of a wide variety of N&#8208;polyheterocycles, such as imidazo&#8208;quinolines and quinoxalines, and furoquinolines, from easily available nitroaromatics and glycols via a molybdenum catalytic domino reduction&#8208;imine formation&#8208;intramolecular cyclization&#8208;oxidation sequence. It is worth highlighting that the recycling and incorporation of the waste carbonyl byproduct, generated in the reduction step, into the final compound is realized. In addition, the overall efficiency and atom economy of the process are further improved owing to the participation of one reaction intermediate as reductant that allows lowering the amount of external reducing agent employed.

         <dc:description>
A transition metal&#8208;free synthesis, involving C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond formations, was employed in a multicomponent protocol to create novel highly substituted 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;[N&#8208;(alkyl/aryl/heteroaryl)&#8208;3&#8208;oxoisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;yl]&#8208;1H&#8208;indene&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;diones. Utilizing a unique combination of phase transfer catalysis and a multi&#8208;component strategy, a total of 26 compounds were successfully synthesized in this study.







Abstract
A facile technique was demonstrated for the synthesis of 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;[N&#8208;(alkyl/aryl/heteroaryl)&#8208;3&#8208;oxoisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;yl]&#8208;1H&#8208;indene&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;diones by using a metal&#8208; free persulfate&#8208;mediated one pot three&#8208;component reaction. The reaction involved the combination effect of TBAB (PTC) and K2S2O8 with the addition of the amine to phthalaldehyde and 2,2&#8208;dihydroxyindane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione to generate isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;one in&#8208;situ, followed by cyclization.This lactamization process facilitated the formation of C&#8722;N bonds under controllable and ambient reaction conditions. A variety of 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;[N&#8208;(substituted)&#8208;3&#8208;oxoisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;yl]&#8208;1H&#8208;indene&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;diones were successfully synthesized through a radical pathway from isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;one, involving C&#8722;C bond formation. The method demonstrated high functional group compatibility and a wide substrate scope, resulting in moderate to good yields of the desired products. Additionally, the mechanistic analyses demonstrated that isoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;one might be a significant intermediate being involved in the reaction. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis was used to examine the crystal structures of synthesized 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;[N&#8208;(substituted)&#8208;3&#8208;oxoisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;yl]&#8208;1H&#8208;indene&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;diones. Furthermore, it seems that the reaction mechanism involves a radical pathway.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Reactions of Alkenes with C&#8211;C Bond Formation: Recent Developments</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkenes are highly valuable materials in organic synthesis, and their three&#8208;component reactions offer a promising method for C&#8208;C bond formation and carbon chain elongation. This approach not only reduces the number of reaction steps but also minimizes waste generation, enabling the preparation of polysubstituted alkanes from simple starting materials. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advancements in this field from 2013 to 2023. We have classified the developments into three main categories: (1) reactions triggered by C&#8208;radicals or heteroatom&#8208;radicals; (2) cascades involving three&#8208;membered ring intermediates; and (3) transformations catalyzed by metals. We will discuss a wide range of reactions that involve diazoium salts, arylhydrazines, acids, aldehydes, 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls, diazo compounds, amines, malononitriles, diacyl peroxides, ethers, 1,3&#8208;dithiane, arenes, CuSCF3, selectfluor, Et3N&#8226;3HF, TBHP, CH2Cl2, CHCl3, CO2, CO, KCl, H2O, and other reagents. These reactions lead to alkylation, arylation, or carbonylation products. We believe that this review will be helpful for future research in this area.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorene and Fluorenone Unnatural Amino Acid Motifs via Diastereoselective Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed sp3 C&#8208;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper reports the construction of racemic and enantiopure (D&#8208; and L&#8208;) fluorene and fluorenone&#8208;based novel unnatural amino acid derivatives. The Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed bidentate directing group&#8208;aided arylation of prochiral &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds in racemic, enantiopure carboxamides of amino acids with iodofluorenes was reported. The construction of novel examples of fluorene and fluorenone motifs containing amino acids comprising of norvaline, leucine, phenylalanine, norleucine, 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid derivatives having the anti&#8208;stereochemistry (with good enantiopurity) was accomplished. The construction of bis fluorenyl alanine scaffolds and fluorenyl motif&#8208;containing non&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid (aminoalkanoic acid) derivatives was also reported. Examples of removal of the directing group (8&#8208;aminoquinoline) and phthalimide&#8208;protecting group present in the fluorenyl&#8208;based unnatural amino acid derivatives have been shown. Accordingly, fluorene motif&#8208;based amino acid esters and free amino group&#8208;containing unnatural amino acid derivatives were synthesized. The stereochemistry of the major (anti) diastereomers obtained via the prochiral &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H arylation of norvaline, leucine, phenylalanine, norleucine, 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid derivatives was ascertained from the X&#8208;ray structure of a representative compound. Fluorene&#8208; and fluorenone&#8208;based motifs are vital skeletons in materials and medicinal chemistry research. Accordingly, this work is a contribution towards enriching the library of fluorene and fluorenone unnatural amino acid scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Pd&#8208;catalysed decarboxylative asymmetric allylic alkylation (DAAA) of sterically hindered &#945;&#8208;aryl,&#946;&#8208;amido allyl ester lactams has been developed. The key step in the synthesis of a range of &#945;&#8208;aryl lactam substrates for catalysis was a Pb&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;arylation of a &#946;&#8208;amido allyl ester affording 14 novel examples of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amido allyl ester lactams in good yields (up to 80 %). The Pd&#8208;catalysed DAAA was optimised with the 2,4,6&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl&#8208;containing substrate. Using (S,S)&#8208;DACH&#8208;phenyl Trost as the optimal chiral ligand, enantioselectivities of up to 82 % ee were obtained. A substrate scope of 11 examples of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amido allyl ester lactams showed that products containing the di&#8208;ortho&#8208;methoxy&#8208;substituted phenyls and naphthyl groups gave rise to the highest ees, whereas products not bearing this substitution pattern showed lower enantioselectivities (&lt; 60 % ee). Transition states to rationalise the observed stereochemical outcome are proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Electrooxidative Annulation of Naphthol with Acrylate via C&#8208;H Bond Activation for the Synthesis of Naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]furan</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iridium catalyzed electrochemical coupling of naphthols with acrylates for the syntheses of naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]furan derivatives are herein reported. Ir&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical C&#8208;H annulation is accomplished within a supportive catalysis manifold, paving the way for electrooxidative C&#8208;H acrylation via weak O&#8208;coordination. The merge of iridium catalysts and electric current not only minimizes the need for a stoichiometric amount of chemical oxidants but also confirms broad reaction compatibility with a variety of electronically and sterically diverse substrates. This utility provides a valuable method for producing a wide range of naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]furan derivatives in good to moderate yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Induced Trifluoromethylation/Cyclization of Unactivated Alkene&#8208;Bound Quinazolinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trifluoromethylation cyclization of unactivated alkenes attached to quinazolinone scaffolds is demonstrated under visible light photocatalysis using readily available and inexpensive trifluoroacetic acid and anhydride, without the need for strong oxidants. A wide substrate range and cyclization to 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered rings has been demonstrated in 44&#8211;82&#8201;% yields.







Abstract
Herein, we reported a selective, mild method for the visible&#8208;light&#8208;photocatalyzed trifluoromethylation and cyclization of unactivated tethered alkenes to provide tri&#8208; and tetracyclic quinazolinones. Trifluoroacetic acid and anhydride are inexpensive and readily available reagents for the process that proceeds without the addition of a strong oxidant. The wide substrate scope and the formation of 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered rings are demonstrated in 44&#8211;82&#8201;% yields. Control experiments provide the basis for a proposed mechanism involving photocatalyzed SET from fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 to TFAA and trifluoromethyl radical&#8208;mediated regioselective cyclization. The practicality of the protocol was illustrated by a gram&#8208;scale synthesis in 76&#8201;% yield.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, we reported a selective, mild method for the visible-light-photocatalyzed trifluoromethylation and cyclization of unactivated tethered alkenes to provide tri- and tetracyclic quinazolinones. Trifluoroacetic acid and anhydride are inexpensive and readily available reagents for the process that proceeds without the addition of a strong oxidant. The wide substrate scope and the formation of 5- and 6-membered rings are demonstrated in 44&#8211;82&#8201;% yields.

         <title>Application of the Photo&#8208;Fries Reaction as a Key Step in the Preparation of Valuable Aryloxyethyl Selenocyanates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A multi&#8208;step sequence leads to the preparation of a series of aryl selenocyanate WC&#8208;9 homologues which are interesting compounds with potential biological activity against Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. The synthetic sequence involves the application of the photo&#8208;Fries rearrangement reaction as a key step for the preparation of a series of 2&#8208;hydroxyphenones bearing alkyl chains of different length and a phenyl group. These intermediates are obtained upon direct irradiation (254 nm) of 4&#8208;phenoxyphenyl esters in different solvents at room temperature. Then, reaction of the 2&#8208;hydroxyphenones with 2&#8208;(2&#8208;bromoethoxy)tetrahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran followed by acid deprotection, tosylation (or mesylation) reaction and, finally, nucleophilic attack with potassium selenocyanate provides the target aryloxyethyl selenocyanate homologues in good yields.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this study, we present an efficient and straightforward dearomative hydroalkylation of indoles. By utilizing alkanes or ethers as alkyl radical sources and employing TBADT as a cost&#8208;effective photocatalyst for direct hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), we achieved successful conversion of these heterocyclic derivatives into 2&#8208;alkylindolines with good to excellent yields and high diastereoselectivity under mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Ferrocenyl&#8208;azole Derivatives: Synthesis, DFT Calculation and Unlocking the Anticancer Potential</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a series of novel ferrocenyl/phenyl/thiophenyl&#8208;azoles was disclosed by vinylic amination of ferrocenyl/phenyl/thiophenyl substituted &#946;&#8208;chloro cinnamaldehydes and acrylonitriles. A highly economical and robust chalcogen&#8208;stabilized iron selenide carbonyl cluster Fe3Se2(CO)9 worked as an efficient catalyst under aerobic conditions. The amination of ferrocenyl/phenyl/thiophenyl substituted &#946;&#8208;chloro&#8208;vinylic Csp2&#8208;Cl with azole derivatives was fully established and fabrication of the Csp2&#8208;N bond was completely supported by various spectral analysis. Moreover, wide range of substrates with functionally different azoles were investigated for the present reaction and good to excellent transformation was recorded. Some of the selected ferrocenated azole derivatives were screened for anti&#8208;cancer activity against the prostate cancer cells (PC&#8208;3) and found to be highly active at low concentration of 5.77&#181;M with IC50 value. Furthermore, HOMO and LUMO levels and energy gap of some selected compounds were calculated by the density functional theory (DFT).</dc:description>

         <title>New Avenues for the Synthesis of Oxa&#8208;Cycles Using Lewis/Br&#248;nsted Acid mediated Carboxygenation and Carboalkoxylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cascade functionalizations of alkynes have provided many elegant methods for the synthesis of useful scaffolds. Amongst these functionalizations, the ones comprising C&#8208;C and C&#8208;O bond formation have been utilized extensively due to the abundant presence of oxygenated motifs in various bio&#8208;active natural as well as unnatural products. Transition&#8208;metal catalysis is a mainstay for these tandem functionalizations as they are very efficient. However, their utilization does typically involve stoichiometric additives like other metal salts and/or Lewis acids/Br&#248;nsted acids (LA/BA). Thus, approaches that rely solely on using LA/BA, make these vital transformations not only eco&#8208;friendly and atom economical but also cost beneficial are fast emerging as complementary alternatives. The present review addresses the gap in the literature by summarizing recent developments in LA/BA mediated 1,1/1,2&#8208;carboxygenation and carboalkoxylation of alkynes for the synthesis of oxa&#8208;cycles. The reaction mechanisms are particularly emphasized to bring out understanding needed from the point of future developments in this domain.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Introduction of an Acetyl Group at the &#945;&#8208;Carbon Atom of an Arene Ring through an Amide Photo&#8208;Fries Rearrangement upon Exposure to UV Light</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We employed amide photo&#8208;Fries rearrangement for the synthesis benzoheterocyclic compounds and found that a direct acylation of &#945;&#8208;carbon in an arene ring can occur upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. In this reaction, the N&#8208;acetyl group of amides underwent rearranged to the &#945;&#8208;position cross the bridgehead carbon to the other side of the carbon under UV&#8208;C light. The reaction conditions were gentle and secure. Moreover, this reaction proves to be more convenient for selectively manipulating benzoheterocyclic compounds in comparison to traditional approaches involving Lewis acid catalysts or anionic reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Promoted Desulfurative Cleavage of Cyclopropylmethyl Thioethers and Amination of the Formed Cyclopropylcarbinyl Cations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclopropylmethyl sulfides react with N&#8208;fluorosulfonimide (NFSI) or molecular iodine, enabling C&#8722;S cleavage to generate cyclopropylcarbinyl cations, which evolve through cyclopropane ring&#8208;opening reactions into homoallyl cations suitable to react with nucleophiles present in the reaction media. This desulfurative cleavage of cyclopropylmethyl thioethers under non&#8208;acidic conditions facilitates homoallylation of N&#8208;based nucleophiles such as alkyl or aryl amines as well as sulfonimides through a one&#8208;pot protocol in one or two steps depending of the nucleophile.

         <title>Selective Synthesis of Functionalized 3(2H)&#8208;Furanones via Tandem Michael Addition/Rearrangement/Cyclization Reaction of Aliphatic Alkynones: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel base&#8208;catalyzed dimerization pathway of widely&#8208;applicable substrates, namely alkynones, is discovered. The key role of catalyst and solvent on the reaction chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity is experimentally revealed and further rationalized through density functional theory study of possible reaction mechanism including ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and quantum theory of atoms in molecules analysis of various substrate/catalyst/solvent complexes.







Abstract
A novel catalyst&#8208; and solvent&#8208;controlled dimerization of aliphatic alkynones through tandem Michael addition/rearrangement/cyclization sequence has been developed. The elaborated protocol provides a convenient chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective access to rare 3(2H)&#8208;furanones decorated with 2&#8208;exo&#8208;methylene and 4&#8208;ethenyl functionalities. A comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) study of possible reaction mechanism including ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis of various substrate/catalyst/solvent complexes has revealed the Janus&#8208;like behavior of the employed sodium tert&#8208;butoxide/toluene system that is responsible both for the chemoselectivity of the initial addition step and the inhibition of the final cyclization step.

         <title>Molecular Networking&#8208;Guided Discovery of Kyonggic Acids in Massilia spp.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metabolomes of six Massilia strains were analyzed using a molecular&#8208;networking guided approach, revealing interconnections among metabolites. A closer inspection of the most promising strains led to the discovery of novel N&#8208;acylated amino acids, termed kyonggic acids. Additionally, cluster analysis also unveiled previously described metabolites such as massiliachelin and its biosynthetic shunt products.







Abstract
In recent years, bacteria of the genus Massilia have been identified as promising sources of bioactive natural products. In this study, we used mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based molecular networking for the first comprehensive analysis of the secondary metabolome of these microorganisms. Annotation of the detected metabolite clusters with a mass fragmentation database revealed several compounds not previously known to be produced by Massilia species. To secure sufficient material for further structural analyses as well as biological testing, we selected the most promising producer strains from our molecular networking analysis and subjected them to larger&#8208;scale cultivation. Following extraction and UV&#8208;directed isolation, we obtained five metabolites in milligram quantities. In addition to a cyclic dipeptide, we elucidated the structures of four acyl amino acids that are related to thalassotalic acid C from the marine bacterium Thalassotalea sp. The Massilia&#8208;derived kyonggic acids were found to inhibit the enzyme tyrosinase, which is involved in melanin biosynthesis influencing skin and hair pigmentation. This study illustrates the value of combining spectroscopic and computational tools in natural product discovery in order to detect and guide the isolation of previously overlooked bioactive compounds.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Synthesis Applied to Optoelectronic and Energy Materials: Design, Applications and Limitations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic Covalent Chemistry can bring together simple components to create complex self&#8208;assembled materials. This strategy is so far under&#8208;investigated in the field of optoelectronic and energy materials. However, it has the potential to rapidly produce self&#8208;assembled organic semiconductors or stimuli responsive devices. Herein, we highlight the advantages of the dynamic covalent approaches and their limitations when applied to this field.







Abstract
Dynamic Covalent Chemistry, consisting in the use of dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) to create complex objects by working at the thermodynamic equilibrium, has undeniable advantages for the preparation of conjugated systems with tailored optoelectronic properties for organic electronics. Chemists can combine simple building blocks with simple functional groups of appropriate geometry, structure and stoichiometry to build multidimensional conjugated architectures. Dynamic covalent reactions are often precious metal&#8208;free, generate little to no side products and are very efficient. DCBs however afford sensitive materials, and consequently a balance needs to be found between the ease of synthesis, the stability and the performances. The dynamicity of the target materials hence can considerably reduce their applicability in organic electronics where strongly stable materials are needed, but opens the door to stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviour and recyclability. A way to overcome dynamicity issues is to lock DCBs, but often at the cost of decreased conjugation. In this review, we will highlight how DCBs are employed to prepare functional optoelectronically active materials, such as discrete molecules, polymers or covalent organic frameworks, applied in fields ranging from organic light&#8208;emitting diodes and solar cells to organic batteries and transistors. We will also discuss their limitations, benefits and the current challenges to overcome.

The dynamicity of the target materials hence can considerably reduce their applicability in organic electronics where strongly stable materials are needed, but opens the door to stimuli-responsive behaviour and recyclability. A way to overcome dynamicity issues is to lock DCBs, but often at the cost of decreased conjugation. In this review, we will highlight how DCBs are employed to prepare functional optoelectronically active materials, such as discrete molecules, polymers or covalent organic frameworks, applied in fields ranging from organic light-emitting diodes and solar cells to organic batteries and transistors. We will also discuss their limitations, benefits and the current challenges to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Double Winding Vine&#8208;Shaped Biphenyl with Molecular Asymmetry. Synthesis, Structure, and Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biphenyl strapped by two chains between benzene rings gives a double winding vine&#8208;shaped structure suggesting a new class of molecular asymmetry, in which enantioinversion hardly occurs.







Abstract
A biphenyl derivative in which two benzene rings are strapped with two chains is prepared. The synthesized product shows molecular asymmetry, which was confirmed by HPLC analysis with chiral column and named as winding vine&#8208;shaped biphenyl. The synthesis of such vine shaped molecule was performed by ring&#8208;closing metathesis or alternatively by annulation with nosylated ethylenediamine. The structure of the obtained product was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The absolute configuration of the molecular asymmetry was assigned after leading to the corresponding camphor sulfonamide through denosylation and re&#8208;amidation process.

         <title>Base&#8208;Regulated Synthesis of the Bestmann&#8208;Ohira or Seyferth&#8208;Gilbert Reagent Utilizing FSO2N3</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bestmann&#8208;Ohira reagent (BOR) and Seyferth&#8208;Gilbert reagent (SGR) were synthesized using FSO2N3 in the presence of a base. While BOR is formed with DBU as a base, SGR is formed with MgO as a base. Moreover, the facile one&#8208;pot synthesis of terminal alkynes from aldehydes has been established, which could be further coupled with azides to deliver triazoles using CuAAC click chemistry.







Abstract
Herein, we present a new application of fluorosulfonylazide (FSO2N3) for diazotizing a series of activated methylene compounds to deliver the corresponding diazo products. Notably, by the judicious choice of bases, the selective generation of the Bestmann&#8208;Ohira reagent (BOR) or the Seyferth&#8208;Gilbert reagent (SGR) has been realized from FSO2N3 and dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxopropylphosphonate. We also investigated the kinetics of the homologation of aldehydes using these two reagents with K2CO3 as a base in MeOH, finding that a faster reaction rate was achieved by using SGR. Moreover, the facile one&#8208;pot synthesis of terminal alkynes from aldehydes has been established, which could be further coupled with azides to deliver triazoles using CuAAC click chemistry.

         <title>A ChemoEnzymatic Approach for the Preparation of &#8220;Linear&#8208;Shaped&#8221; Diaryl Pyrazines as Potential Antiprotozoal Agents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from simple, commercially available aromatic aldehydes, &#8220;linear&#8208;shaped&#8221; diaryl pyrazines were prepared by a novel chemoenzymatic route comprising a biocatalyzed benzoin condensation reaction and a transaminase&#8208;mediated tandem process of transamination and cyclization. The obtained pyrazines were tested for their potential leishmanicidal and antiplasmodial activity in&#8197;vitro.







Abstract
Nitrogenous heterocyclic rings are present in a wide range of drugs, natural compounds, and fine chemicals and are considered privileged scaffolds in medicinal chemistry. Seeking novel anti&#8208;protozoal drugs acting on new targets or by novel mechanisms of action, we focused on a preliminary evaluation of the potential of &#8220;linear&#8208;shaped&#8221; diaryl pyrazines. To this purpose, a two&#8208;enzyme chemoenzymatic synthesis of this heteroaromatic core was carried out. Specifically, starting from simple, commercially available aromatic aldehydes, the target pyrazines were obtained through a sequence of biocatalytic benzoin condensation, chemical oxidation and a transaminase&#8208;mediated tandem process of transamination and cyclization. The profiles of the compounds as antiprotozoal agents were evaluated in&#8197;vitro against parasites cultures of the Leishmania and Plasmodium genera and using the human cell line HepG2.

         <title>[N&#8722;I&#8722;N] Type Halogen Bonding: Structure, Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[N&#8722;I&#8722;N] type halogen bonds have gradually attracted much attention. This concept summarizes the structure, classification, synthesis, and application of [N&#8722;I&#8722;N] type halogen bonds. The challenges in this field were identified and its development prospects are also discussed.







Abstract
Halogen bond has received widespread attention in recent years due to the vast applications in supramolecular chemistry, sensing and crystal engineering. In contrast to the normal halogen bonds, [N&#8722;I&#8722;N] type halogen bond exhibits enhanced strength and solvent resistance capabilities. It adopts a bonding geometry of the three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron bond, where the nitrogen can be a neutral, positive, or negative species such as pyridine, saccharin, and urotropine moieties. The emerging new type halogen bond has found specific potentials in constructing supramolecular architectures and catalysis. This concept provides a brief summary based on recent developments of [N&#8722;I&#8722;N] type halogen bonding, reviewing and summarizing its synthesis, structure and application.

&lt;p&gt;[N&#8722;I&#8722;N] type halogen bonds have gradually attracted much attention. This concept summarizes the structure, classification, synthesis, and application of [N&#8722;I&#8722;N] type halogen bonds. The challenges in this field were identified and its development prospects are also discussed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halogen bond has received widespread attention in recent years due to the vast applications in supramolecular chemistry, sensing and crystal engineering. In contrast to the normal halogen bonds, [N&#8722;I&#8722;N] type halogen bond exhibits enhanced strength and solvent resistance capabilities. It adopts a bonding geometry of the three-center four-electron bond, where the nitrogen can be a neutral, positive, or negative species such as pyridine, saccharin, and urotropine moieties. The emerging new type halogen bond has found specific potentials in constructing supramolecular architectures and catalysis. This concept provides a brief summary based on recent developments of [N&#8722;I&#8722;N] type halogen bonding, reviewing and summarizing its synthesis, structure and application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 Compound&#8208;Activated DMSO: An Efficient Oxidizing Reagent to Convert Alcohols to Ketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When high&#8208;valent Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 compounds meet DMSO, a unique platform is set up to manipulate sulfonium chemistry. A case study of oxidation of alcohols to ketones is shown herein. Crucial trifluoromethoxysulfonium is initially generated, and reacts with alcohols to give new alkoxysulfonium species via ligand exchange. Subsequent base&#8208;promoted E2 elimination gives ketones with the release of Me2S.







Abstract
In this study high&#8208;valent Cu(III) trifluoromethyl compounds in combination with DMSO is shown to be an efficient and mild oxidizing system for the conversion of alcohols to ketones (aldehydes as well). Trifluoromethoxylated sulfonium species is proposed to be initially formed that engages in crucial steps of alkoxy replacement at sulfonium center and deprotonative collapse of the resulting alkoxysulfonium intermediate in the presence of a base. This reaction is highly selective without over&#8208;oxidation, and can tolerate a broad range of functional groups owing to mild oxidizing ability of the Cu(III)&#8208;CF3/DMSO system and the inert N2 conditions. This method can be applied to the synthesis and functionalization of commercial drug compounds. This study illustrates an unusual reactivity property of high&#8208;valent Cu(III) trifluoromethyl compounds beyond the conventional CF3 group transfer reactivity, and opens up new opportunities for developing novel reactions of Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 compounds. The combined use of high&#8208;valent Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 compound and DMSO is anticipated to find more applications to develop other novel and useful oxidation reactions.

         <title>Mechanochemical Assembly of a Nitrile&#8208;Based Directing Group in Arylacetic Acids Using the Passerini 3&#8208;CR: Exploration of the Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed meta&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H Bond Olefination Process</title>

         <dc:description>
A practical solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical protocol for installing a nitrile&#8208;based directing group in arylacetic acids through the Passerini 3&#8208;CR and the subsequent Pd(II)&#8208;mediated meta&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H olefination process has been developed.







Abstract
The multicomponent assembly of a nitrile&#8208;based directing group in a set of arylacetic acids under solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical conditions using the Passerini 3&#8208;CR and the subsequent Pd(II)&#8208;mediated meta&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H bond olefination process has been achieved. The protocol demonstrated that removing the DG under mild conditions from the activated Passerini adducts affords a novel N&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;cyanophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyacetamide, which can be re&#8208;utilized in the future as DG in other distal activation processes.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free ipso&#8208;Halocyclization of N&#8208;Arylpropynamides Using Hypervalent Iodine(III) Reagents under Aqueous Condition</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient intramolecular ipso&#8208;halocyclization of para&#8208;unsubstituted N&#8208;arylpropynamides proceeds using readily available hypervalent iodine reagents as oxidant and potassium halides as halogen source under aqueous medium. This method shows a broad substrate scope and doesn't require any metal catalysts.







Abstract
We report, an intramolecular ipso&#8208;halocyclization of N&#8208;arylpropynamides using readily available hypervalent iodine reagent as mild oxidant and alkali halides like KCl, KBr, and KI as the halogen source. Using this method, a broad range of valuable halogenated spiro[4.5]trienones can be obtained in an excellent yield at room temperature. Notably, this protocol doesn't require para&#8208;substituents such as methoxy or fluoro group on the N&#8208;aryl ring. Also, this reaction takes place in the absence of any metal catalyst under aqueous conditions and exhibits a broad substrate scope with high functional group tolerance. A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed based on control experiments.

The arylation of 5,4&#8208;disubstituted 2,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;3H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3&#8208;thiones was investigated under Ullmann&#8208;type reaction conditions involving ligand&#8208;free Cu(0) catalysis, the results of which showed that the reaction proceeds chemoselectively with the formation of S&#8208;arylation products. In some cases, when an electron&#8208;withdrawing group is present in the arylating agent, the reaction can proceed without a catalyst.







Abstract
We investigated the S&#8208;arylation of 5,4&#8208;disubstituted 2,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;3H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3&#8208;thiones under ligand&#8208;free Cu(0) catalysis employing Ullmann&#8208;type reaction conditions. We determined optimal reaction conditions and assessed the impact of substituents in the arylating agent on the reaction progress. Notably, the presence of an electron&#8208;withdrawing group (EWG) in the aryl halide facilitated the reaction even without a catalyst. In particular, an EWG in the para position of the aromatic ring exerted a directing effect on the leaving group, regardless of the halogen present.

         <dc:description>n&#8208;Bu4NI/K2S2O8&#8208;mediated C&#8208;N coupling between aldehydes and amides is reported. A strong electronic effect is observed on the aromatic aldehyde substrates. The transformylation from aldehyde to amide takes place exclusively when an aromatic aldehyde bears electron&#8208;donating groups at either the ortho or para position of the formyl group, while the cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling dominates in the absence of these groups. Both the density functional theory (DFT) thermochemistry calculations and experimental data support the proposed single electron transfer mechanism with the formation of an acyl radical intermediate in the cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling. The n&#8208;Bu4NI/K2S2O8 mediated oxidative cyclization between 2&#8208;aminobenzamide and aldehydes is also reported, with four quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones prepared in 65&#8208;99% yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Aerobic Photoredox Catalyzed Oxamate Ester Synthesis from Bromodifluoroacetate Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel synthetic method for oxamate esters using bromodifluoroacetate esters and amines under aerobic photoredox catalysis. In contrast to previous methods that require the use of moisture&#8208;sensitive precursors and/or harsh conditions, this method utilizes bench&#8208;stable bromodifluoroacetate esters as an oxamate ester precursor under mild conditions, providing a variety of oxamate esters.







Abstract
Here we report an aerobic photoredox catalysis approach to oxamate ester synthesis using bromodifluoroacetate esters and amines under open&#8208;air conditions. Oxamate ester is an important skeleton found in bioactive molecules and used as a synthetic building block. However, previous synthetic methods require the use of moisture&#8208; and air&#8208;sensitive precursors and/or harsh conditions, limiting accessible oxamate esters. The present method uses bench&#8208;stable bromodifluoroacetate esters and amines under mild photoredox catalytic conditions to furnish a wide variety of oxamate esters. Combining photoredox catalysis with aerobic oxygenation enables the use of bromodifluoroacetate ester as a precursor for the synthesis of oxamate esters via fluoroglyoxylate esters.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NIS/TEMPO&#8208;mediated procedure for the C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reaction of tertiary amines with trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) and nitroalkanes was developed. The N&#8208;Mannich base formed from the tertiary amine and NIS had a stabilizing effect on the iminium intermediate.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free N&#8208;iodosuccinimde (NIS)/2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyloxy (TEMPO)&#8208;promoted protocol was developed for the oxidative cyanation and nitro&#8208;Mannich reaction of tertiary amines via a cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reaction under mild conditions. Several control experiments were performed; the coupling reaction outcomes indicated that the C&#8722;N coupled intermediate (N&#8208;Mannich base) formed from the tertiary amine and NIS had a stabilizing effect on the iminium cation.

Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced metal&#8208;free three&#8208;component amidoheteroarylation of alkenes to synthesize &#946;&#8208;(hetero)arylethylamines







Abstract
Herein, visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced metal&#8208;free three&#8208;component amidoheteroarylation of alkenes with quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and N&#8208;sulfonylaminopyridinium salts is developed. This protocol involves a radical relay process in which the N&#8208;centered radicals undergo chemoselective addition to alkenes to form an alkyl radical that selectively combines with heteroarenes, leading to the formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds in one step under mild reaction conditions. The involved high efficiency and selectivity, wide substrate scope, and excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility demonstrate the practicability of the developed protocol.

         <title>A New Strategy for the Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Crambescin B Decarboxylate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(+)&#8208;Crambescin B decarboxylate was synthesized using a new synthetic strategy, which is nine steps shorter than the previously reported shortest method. We determined its cytotoxicity and protective effects in neuronal HT22 cells with an MTS assay. Cell viability was observed to decrease in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner without cell detachment or shrinkage. Additionally, the compound protected glutamate&#8208;induced cell death.







Abstract
Crambescin B decarboxylate is an inhibitor of voltage&#8208;gated sodium channels and a potential biochemical tool. Herein, we report the asymmetric total synthesis of crambescin B decarboxylate using a new synthetic strategy. The key aspects of this new protocol include: 1) the use of an optically pure epoxide, synthesized by the Jacobsen hydrolytic kinetic resolution, as the starting material for guanidino&#8208;aziridine, and 2) the introduction of the THF ring through nucleophilic substitution using an acyl anion equivalent. The synthetic protocol reported herein is nine steps shorter than the previously reported shortest method. We determined the cytotoxicity and protective effects of crambescin B decarboxylate in mouse&#8208;hippocampus&#8208;derived neuronal HT22 cells with an MTS assay. Cell viability was observed to decrease in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner without cell detachment or shrinkage. In addition, crambescin B decarboxylate protected glutamate&#8208;induced cell death.

         <title>Hexafluoroisopropanol Promoted Ring&#8208;Opening&#8208;Cyclization of Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropanes with Primary Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free, ring&#8208;opening&#8208;cyclization reaction of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes with primary amines is reported with HFIP.







Abstract
We reveal here a catalyst&#8208;free, ring&#8208;opening&#8208;cyclization of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes with primary amines to synthesize functionalized dihydropyrroles. This protocol avoids inert conditions and solvents promoted by hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP). The reaction is quite general with aryl, alkyl, and alicyclic amines. A good number of cyclopropanes bearing keto groups reacted excellently to produce the desired products. Further, we complemented this method with Meldrum's acid&#8208;derived cyclopropanes for synthesizing &#947;&#8208;lactams. We have demonstrated the post&#8208;synthetic applications of the products and gram&#8208;scale synthesis to highlight the adaptability of this synthetic protocol.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Branch Selective C&#8208;H Alkylation of Indoles and Azoles with Alkenes: An Additive&#8208; and Solvent&#8208;Free Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of sustainable protocols for the synthesis of alkylated heteroarenes is crucial owing to their widespread existence in medicinally relevant and bioactive natural products. Herein, we describe an efficient, additive&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free approach for the regioselective C&#8722;H alkylation of indoles and azoles with alkenes using a nickel catalyst, which proceeds through a chelation&#8208;assistance strategy. The reaction exclusively provided branched alkylated products with the compatibility of alkyl, alkoxy, fluoro, trifluoromethyl, alkene, cyano, ester, and carbonyl groups. This protocol is applicable to other heteroarenes, such as imidazoles and benzimidazoles, providing the desired alkylated products with exclusive Markovnikov selectivity. The synthetic utility and scale&#8208;up of the reaction are demonstrated, and the protocol is in concord with the principles of green chemistry. Alkylation proceeds through facile and reversible C&#8722;H nickelation and alkene insertion processes, presumably involving rate&#8208;limiting reductive elimination.</dc:description>

A systematic investigation of the optical and chiroptical features of the final chiral dyes was performed in chloroform solution and on spin&#8208;coated thin films. The ECD investigation was crucial in revealing that, even within the same family of organic dyes, minor variations in the nature and length of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone can result in very different solid&#8208;state arrangements at different hierarchical scales.</dc:description>

         <title>A Simple Device for Automated Mixing of Heterogeneous Solid&#8208;Liquid Reactions During In&#8208;Situ Monitoring by NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plunger&#8208;based device has been developed for the automated mixing of heterogeneous solid&#8208;liquid reactions in a 5&#8197;mm tube inside a standard NMR probe. The plunger design, plunger velocity, settling time, and mixing&#8208;to&#8208;acquisition time ratio are explored by NMR and UV&#8208;Vis to determine the optimum parameters for reaction kinetics to be monitored in&#8208;situ.







Abstract
In&#8208;situ NMR spectroscopy can provide valuable insight into chemical reactions, including detailed information on reaction kinetics and thus mechanism. The application of in&#8208;situ NMR techniques to heterogeneous reactions has so far been limited by the requirement for efficient mixing, which is challenging within the confines of a standard NMR spectrometer. We report an automated plunger&#8208;based device for the mixing of heterogeneous solid&#8208;liquid reactions conducted within a 5&#8197;mm tube in a standard NMR probe, allowing reaction kinetics and speciation to be monitored in&#8208;situ. The system has been tested by measuring the kinetics for three diverse reactions and comparison of these with the reaction velocities measured by routine ex&#8208;situ analysis after sampling. The effect of key parameters including plunger design, plunger velocity, solid settling time, and mixing&#8208;to&#8208;acquisition time ratio are explored to determine the optimum parameters for combining efficient mixing with spectral quality. With adaptation, the device may also be suitable for benchtop NMR.

         <dc:description>A formal [4+2] cycloaddition reaction of ethynylethylene carbonates and 2&#8208;aminophenols has been developed for the synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[b][1,4]oxazines bearing quaternary carbon atoms. The reaction features mild reaction conditions, good functional group compatibility and good yields. Furthermore, when using chiral PyBox ligand, this strategy could also achieve the asymmetric synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[b][1,4]oxazines. Application studies indicated that the hydroxymethyl group of final products was an excellent functional group that can be further modified easily.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Two series of novel hybrid heterocyclic compounds that combine the imidazole ring with bioactive piperidine, morpholine or piperazine heterosystems, through a hydrazone unit, were easily obtained by two competitive pathways. Starting from 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoformimidoyl imidazoles and 1&#8208;aminopiperidine, 4&#8208;aminomorpholine or 1&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;methylpiperazine under mild acidic media led to the selective synthesis of 5&#8208;aminoimidazole 4&#8208;carboxamidrazones, whereas the corresponding 4&#8208;hydrazonoyl cyanide derivatives were obtained under stronger acidic conditions. These highly functionalized imidazoles provide convenient synthetic precursors to a vast array of heterocycles with potential pharmaceutical applications. The reaction mechanisms were elucidated on the basis of experimental assays and in silico calculations. The compounds were screened against colorectal cancer HCT116&#8208;p53 wt cell line, and significant IC50 values of 3.69 &#181;M and 4.83 &#181;M were obtained.</dc:description>

Abstract
We present a method for the synthesis of substituted indolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoline&#8208;5(6H)&#8208;ones starting from 1&#8208;(2&#8208;ethynylphenyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indoles. The transformation involves gold&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of the triple bond followed by acid&#8208;promoted intramolecular cyclization at the indole C2 position. Demonstrating noteworthy versatility, the reaction tolerates a wide array of substituents on the indole core and proceeds in good to excellent yields (up to 93&#8201;%).

         <title>Practical and Selective Syntheses of S&#8208;Acyl and N&#8208;Acyl Glutathiones with N&#8208;Acyl Imidazoles in Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a simple and efficient glutathione acylation reaction for the chemoselective synthesis of S&#8208; or N&#8208;acylated glutathione derivatives, under mild conditions and using water as the solvent, by means of the in&#8208;situ formation of acyl imidazole electrophiles from the respective abundant carboxylic acid.







Abstract
A selective, mild, convenient, and green protocol for the preparation of S&#8208;acyl and N&#8208;acyl glutathiones is described involving the chemical modification of glutathione (GSH) with N&#8208;acyl imidazoles at room temperature in water. The syntheses of S&#8208;acyl glutathiones were achieved in very high yields using 1 equiv. of an N&#8208;acyl imidazole in water at room temperature, without the need of a base. Double acylation of GSH with various N&#8208;acyl imidazoles in weakly basic aqueous media in the presence of N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (HOSu) as the activating reagent followed by selective deprotection of the S&#8208;acyl group with aqueous ammonia at room temperature gave high yields of N&#8208;acyl glutathiones. Moreover, the reaction could accommodate a diverse range of carboxylic acids such as (hetero)benzoic acids, phenylacetic acids, aliphatic acids from short&#8208;chain fatty acids (including acetic acid), long&#8208;chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, secondary or tertiary amino acids, and carboxylic acids containing clickable functional groups, fluorescent probes, or drugs.

&lt;p&gt;We report a simple and efficient glutathione acylation reaction for the chemoselective synthesis of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;- or &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acylated glutathione derivatives, under mild conditions and using water as the solvent, by means of the &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; formation of acyl imidazole electrophiles from the respective abundant carboxylic acid.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A selective, mild, convenient, and green protocol for the preparation of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-acyl and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acyl glutathiones is described involving the chemical modification of glutathione (GSH) with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acyl imidazoles at room temperature in water. The syntheses of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-acyl glutathiones were achieved in very high yields using 1 equiv. of an &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acyl imidazole in water at room temperature, without the need of a base. Double acylation of GSH with various &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acyl imidazoles in weakly basic aqueous media in the presence of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxysuccinimide (HOSu) as the activating reagent followed by selective deprotection of the &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-acyl group with aqueous ammonia at room temperature gave high yields of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acyl glutathiones. Moreover, the reaction could accommodate a diverse range of carboxylic acids such as (hetero)benzoic acids, phenylacetic acids, aliphatic acids from short-chain fatty acids (including acetic acid), long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, secondary or tertiary amino acids, and carboxylic acids containing clickable functional groups, fluorescent probes, or drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Promoted Minisci&#8211;Type Cyanoalkylation of Azauracils via C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage</title>

         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;induced Minisci&#8211;type cyanoalkylation of azauracils and cyclobutanone oxime esters was developed under metal&#8208;free and base&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
A photo&#8208;induced Minisci&#8211;type cyanoalkylation of azauracils was developed under metal&#8208;free and base&#8208;free conditions. Readily available cyclobutanone oxime esters were used as the cyanoalkylating reagents via C&#8722;C bond cleavage to generate the &#947;&#8208;cyanoalkyl azauracil derivatives in good to moderate yields. The introduced cyano group can be easily converted into many other functional groups, thus makes current protocol more practical.

         <title>Practical and Divergent Synthesis of Carbocyclic Pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine Nucleoside Analogues</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented base&#8208;build&#8208;up strategy has been applied for the synthesis of carbocyclic pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine nucleoside analogues. The analogues were synthesized at the very last stage to provide swift access to a concise set of compounds. A methoxy&#8208;substituted analogue displayed low micromolar activity against Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma rhodesiense.







Abstract
A concise set of 4&#8208;substituted pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine carboriboside analogues was synthesized in a divergent fashion via a central intermediate. An oxaziridine reagent allowed the synthesis of a crucial hydrazine glycon intermediate, which was transformed through a base&#8208;build&#8208;up strategy into the desired intermediate using a commercially available pyrimidine building block. Reaction with a variety of nucleophiles allowed late&#8208;stage diversification. All analogues were evaluated for activity against a representative panel of Trypanosomatida. A methoxy&#8208;substituted analogue displayed single&#8208;digit micromolar activity against two subspecies of Trypanosoma brucei in cellular assays.

         <title>Stereoselective Total Synthesis of Pyranicin and 4&#8208;Epi&#8208;Pyranicin from Carbohydrate Precursors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of pyranicin and 4&#8208;epi&#8208;pyranicin has been accomplished from carbohydrate precursors. The general synthetic strategy includes two main fragment formations: (1) THP fragment (2) Butenolide fragment.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a simple and efficient pathway for the total synthesis of pyranicin and 4&#8208;epi&#8208;pyranicin by utilizing carbohydrates as chiral raw materials for the first time. The general synthetic strategy involves the formation of two main fragments: Fragment 1 is the central tetrahydropyran core, which was constructed in a total of 10 steps from 2,3,4,6&#8208;tetra&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl D&#8208;glucal via Ferrier&#8208;type rearrangement and oxidative cyclization as the key steps. Fragment 2 is the butenolide fragment, which was obtained in a gram scale with a total of 14 steps from diacetyl&#8208;L&#8208;rhamnal involving a ring contraction strategy.

         <title>Exploitation of Mechanistic Product Selectivity for the Two&#8208;Step Synthesis of Optically Active Bio&#8208;Derived Cyclic Carbonates Incorporating Amino Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of cyclic carbonates bearing amino acid functionality is described. The use of enantiopure amino acids and glycidol, in the initial formation of the substrate, combined with the stereo&#8208;retentive mechanism of the cycloaddition with CO2 furnishes bio&#8208;derived cyclic carbonates which display a range of optical activities. A DFT study provides important insights into the operative mechanism.







Abstract
The synthesis of bio&#8208;derived cyclic carbonates is attracting a lot of attention as the incorporation of bio&#8208;derived functionality into these compounds provides the opportunity to prepare previously unknown structures, whilst also improving their sustainability profiles. This study presents a facile preparation of diastereomerically pure bio&#8208;derived cyclic carbonates displaying a range of optical rotation values. These compounds are obtained from glycidol, amino acids and CO2 in a facile two&#8208;step approach. Initially, the diastereomerically pure amino acid functionalised epoxides are prepared through a robust Steglich esterification of enantiopure glycidol (R or S) and an amino acid (D or L). Thereafter, in a second step, cycloaddition of the epoxide with CO2 results in the retention of the initial stereochemistry of the epoxide, furnishing novel diastereomerically pure and optically active cyclic carbonate products. A DFT study has explained the basis of this observed retention of configuration for these compounds. Further, results from this DFT study also provide new mechanistic information concerning a co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free cycloaddition reaction starting from glycidol when using the gallium&#8208;catalyst, which is found to operate through metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component strategy for the Friedel&#8208;Crafts arylation of &#945;&#8208;imino ketones with imidazopyridines under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. The reaction did not require any inert conditions and proceeded at room temperature in the open flask.







Abstract
We report here a catalyst&#8208;free, (sp2)C&#8722;H imination reaction of in&#8208;situ formed imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines and &#945;&#8208;iminoketones. This one&#8208;pot, multicomponent, and atom economic reaction is performed at moderate to room temperature without the need for any catalyst and inert conditions. The reaction showed good substrate tolerance with appreciable yields. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and post&#8208;synthetic modifications to obtain 1,2&#8208;diketones are also described.

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Catenanes Platformed with meso&#8208;Arylporphyrin</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Padlock&#8221; structures comprising cyclodextrin (CD) catenanes were successfully constructed using a strong intermolecular interaction of CD with meso&#8208;arylporphyrin in water. A water soluble Grubbs's catalyst was used for interlocking CD onto the porphyrin. The novel catenane compounds were useful to elucidate the highly specific intermolecular interactions of methylated CD to meso&#8208;(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl)porphyrins in water.







Abstract
Among mechanically interlocked supramolecular systems with cyclodextrins (CDs), successful examples of CD&#8208;based catenanes are limited compared to a number of CD rotaxanes owing to the synthetic difficulties. We herein demonstrate an efficient synthesis of a CD&#8208;based catenane using a meso&#8208;arylporphyrin (Por) platform. Using Por modified with two olefin&#8208;terminated oxyethylene chains at the cis&#8208;meso&#8208;positions, an interlocked Por&#8208;CD catenane was synthesized via olefin metathesis in the presence of per&#8208;O&#8208;methylated &#946;&#8208;CD (TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD) in water. The novel Por&#8208;CD catenane was obtained in 30&#8201;% isolated yield, which was characterized by MALDI&#8208;TOF mass and NMR spectroscopies. In the latter part, we demonstrate determination of the binding constants between TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD and meso&#8208;(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin using Por&#8208;CD catenane, 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD (DMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD), and 13C&#8208;labeled TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD (13C&#8208;TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD). The host&#8208;guest exchange reaction from the Por&#8208;CD catenane/DMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD to the Por&#8208;CD catenane/TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD complexes was directly monitored through 1D HMQC spectroscopy. The ratio of these complexes revealed the difference in the binding affinities of DMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD and TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD to Por. The stable 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 inclusion complex between meso&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin (TPPS) and TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD has been well&#8208;studied for many years. This study is the first to determine the respective binding constants, K1 and K2, using the model system, to be 3.0&#215;107&#8197;M&#8722;1 and 3.4&#215;107&#8197;M&#8722;1, respectively.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C8&#8208;Fluoroalkylation and C8&#8208;Fluoroalkenylation of Naphthalenes by C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful realization of direct palladium&#8208;catalyzed C8&#8208;fluoroalkylation and C8&#8208;fluoroalkenylation of naphthalene derivatives has been accomplished, employing iodonium salts as coupling partners. The reactions exhibited complete C8&#8208;regioselectivity, and diverse carbonyl groups were identified as effective directing groups.







Abstract
In this study, two novel C8&#8208;functionalization methods of 1&#8208;carbonylnaphthalenes were developed. Leveraging iodonium triflates as coupling partners, we disclose palladium&#8208;catalyzed C8&#8208;fluoroalkylation and C8&#8208;fluoroalkenylation processes. These protocols exhibit broad applicability across diverse naphthalene derivatives, owing to carbonyl directing groups at the C1 position which can be retained for subsequent applications or selectively removed, enhancing the versatility of the developed methodologies.

Diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of some novel functionalized azaheterocyclic &#946;&#8208;amino esters with multiple chiral centers from 1,3&#8208;cyclooctadiene&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;amino acids has been accomplished through stereocontrolled metathesis protocols.







Abstract
Diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of some novel functionalized azaheterocyclic &#946;&#8208;amino esters with multiple chiral centers from 1,3&#8208;cyclooctadiene&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;amino acids through a stereocontrolled synthetic route has been accomplished. The strategy was based on the creation of some novel unsaturated N&#8208;protected cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino esters from 1,3&#8208;cyclooctadiene. Products were subjected to ring&#8208;opening metathesis (ROM) followed by selective ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM). A comparative investigation on the selectivity, regarding the catalysts, yields, conversions, and substrate directing effect on ring&#8208;rearrangement metathesis (RRM) transformation has been accomplished. Importantly, the procedure used in this synthetic process does not affect the configuration of the chiral centers. The pathway takes place across conservation of the configurations of the stereocenters; therefore, the architectural skeleton of the starting cyclooctene&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;amino acids predetermined the structure of the new azaheterocyclic systems.

         <title>Nitrile Furanics via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydration of Aldoximes and Knoevenagel Condensation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrile furanic compounds have been prepared employing two simple synthetic approaches; i) dehydration of aldoximes and ii) Knoevenagel condensation. Both methodologies were firstly tested and optimized on furfural and thus exploited on 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furfural (HMF) and 5,5&#8217;&#8208;oxy(bismethylene)&#8208;2&#8208;furaldehyde (OBMF). All the resulting products were achieved in good to excellent yield and isolated as pure employing simple purification procedure.







Abstract
In this work two synthetic approaches to introduce nitrile moieties into bio&#8208;based derived furanic compounds were investigated, i.&#8201;e., dehydration of aldoximes and Knoevenagel condensation. Both methodologies have been first tested and optimized on furfural and thus exploited on 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furfural (HMF) and 5,5&#8217;&#8208;oxy(bismethylene)&#8208;2&#8208;furaldehyde (OBMF). The syntheses of furfural, HMF and OBMF aldoximes were efficiently conducted (also in large scale) under mild reaction conditions and short reaction time. The subsequent dehydration to nitrile furanic compounds was carried out in the presence of catalytic amount of copper acetate monohydrate. Furthermore, Knoevenagel condensations were performed on furfural, HMF and OBMF with different Activated Methylene Group compounds, using for the first&#8208;time dimethyl carbonate as the reaction media. Most of the resulting products were isolated as pure via simple liquid&#8208;liquid extraction in good to excellent yields. Future applications of these compounds might include aldoxime reduction into amine furanics &#8208; herein also preliminary investigated &#8208; and hydrolysis of the nitrile derivatives in the related carboxylic acid (or ester) furanics. All these products are interesting monomers for the preparation of bio&#8208;based polymers.

Abstract
The treatment of diethyl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydroaminophosphonate&#8197;1 with various arenes (ArH=toluene 2&#8201;a, benzene 2&#8201;b, anisole 2&#8201;c, bromobenzene 2&#8201;d, chlorobenzene 2&#8201;e, benzyl alcohol 2&#8201;f, p&#8208;xylene 2&#8201;g) in acetic acid (AcOH) at 120&#8201;&#176;C for 8&#8197;h in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 (10&#8201;%&#8201;mol, OAc=acetate) and AgOAc (3.4&#8197;equivalents) results in the formation of the corresponding &#946;&#8208;aryl derivatives E&#8208;Ar(H)C=C(NHAc)P(O)(OEt)2 3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;g. The reaction proceeds through double C&#8722;H activation (arene and alkene) and subsequent C&#8722;C oxidative coupling (Fujiwara&#8211;Moritani reaction), processes catalyzed by Pd and assisted by Ag. The obtained products 3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;g are isosteric analogs of phenylalanine and are obtained with high selectivity. Thus, geometrical E&#8208;isomers have been obtained in all studied cases, however mixtures of ortho&#8208;/meta&#8208;/para&#8208;isomers are observed when the activated position in the starting arene 2 is considered.

         <title>Benzocoumarin&#8208;Fused Triskelions Exhibit AIEE Due to Inhibited Molecular Inversion</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triskelion&#8208;shaped AIEgens consisting of benzo[f], [g], and [h]coumarin units (2F, 2G, and 2H) were successfully synthesized through the intramolecular Ullmann coupling. These compounds adopt unique &#960;&#8208;twisted helical geometries because of the fusion mode of the benzocoumarins, and the structural isomers have different molecular thicknesses and planarities. These compounds demonstrate remarkable AIEE behaviour in the aggregated states because molecular inversion is suppressed.







Abstract
Developing aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) is a unique strategy for alleviating concentration quenching of &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic compounds. This AIE behaviour can be induced not only in organic dyes with rotors but also in invertible &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. Herein, intramolecular Ullmann coupling was used to synthesize &#960;&#8208;twisted triskelion&#8208;shaped AIEgens (2F, 2G, and 2H), in which benzo[f], [g], and [h] coumarins were fused into the benzene core to form a helical propeller shape. These structural isomers had unique molecular thicknesses and planarities depending on the fusion mode of the benzocoumarin. The racemic crystals, PPP and MMM, had different overlapping molecular configurations because of their twisted molecular frameworks. Compounds&#8197;2F, 2G and 2H demonstrated weak fluorescence emission in diluted solutions resulting from molecular motions caused by the isomerization process during molecular inversion. By comparison, aggregates exhibited enhanced emission intensity. These &#960;&#8208;twisted triskelions exhibited the characteristics of AIEgens.
