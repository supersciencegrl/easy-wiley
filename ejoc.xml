         <title>Cu&#8208;catalyzed Bilateral Linkage of Sulfenamides for the Construction of Benzothiophene&#8208;based Cyclic Sulfilimines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;catalyzed bilateral linkage of sulfenamides and diaryliodonium salts was developed for the one&#8208;step synthesis of Benzothiophene&#8208;based cyclic sulfilimines. The challenging cyclic sulfoximines can be efficiently obtained via subsequent oxidation. Photophysical properties and DFT calculations reveal that cyclic sulfoximines, compared to cyclic sulfilimines and sulfones, exhibit larger Stokes shifts and reduced HOMO&#8208;LUMO orbital overlap.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Step, One&#8208;Pot Baeyer&#8208;Villiger Oxidation of Biomass&#8208;Derived Levoglucosenone Derivatives to Chiral, C4&#8208;Sustituted 5&#8208;Hydroxymethyl Butyrolactones</title>

Robust route towards the implementation of a Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation employed cellulose&#8208;derived levoglucosenone ring contraction through a 2&#8208;step one&#8208;pot process. The development and optimization of a two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot route towards substituted butyrolactones from levoglucosenone and cyrene derived from cellulose, representing a major step towards the sustainable production of chiral platform chemicals. A range of substituted analogues have been employed and their novelty is outlined in the paper.







Abstract
A two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot rapid microwave assisted method has been developed for the Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation of biomass derived levoglucosenone (LGO) analogues. This method uses the acidic resin Amberlyst 15 as the catalyst and hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant in ethanol solution. A small library of C4&#8208;substituted LGO analogues have been synthesised and oxidised using this method giving high yields in short times in each case. The purity of the recovered products was very high removing the need for chromatographic separation.

         <title>Synthesis of Quinolino[4,3&#8208;j]phenanthridines and their Photophysical Characterization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nine novel quinolino[4,3&#8208;j]phenanthridines were successfully synthesized. UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy revealed remarkable optoelectronic properties. Large Stokes shifts were especially observed for the protonated substrates. The experimental results were compared and complemented with quantum chemical calculations, providing further insights into the compounds&#8217; properties.







Abstract
Quinolino[4,3&#8208;j]phenanthridines were synthesized from para&#8208;terphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;diamines, which were obtained by cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The diamines were converted into amides and ortho&#8208;cyclized to quinolino[4,3&#8208;j]phenanthridines using Morgan&#8208;Walls reactions. Prolonged reaction times were required in these electrophilic substitution reactions to overcome the respective deactivated intermediates formed after the first ortho fusion. Optophysical properties were determined by UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and calculated by quantum chemical calculations. The compounds exhibit rather small HOMO/LUMO gaps and a remarkable bathochromic shift of luminescence upon protonation, what makes these compounds promising candidates for optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Vinyl Boronates from Aldehydes and Ketones by Peterson Olefination: Investigation of the Peterson/Boron&#8208;Wittig Chemoselectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have investigated the possibility of synthesizing substituted vinyl boronates from gem&#8208;borylsilylmethane derivatives using the Peterson olefination. Our results show a total chemoselectivity for the Peterson olefination over the boron&#8208;Wittig reaction, and a low Z selectivity, regardless of the nature of the carbonyl partner. A mechanistic study helps explain observed reactivity, chemoselectivity and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
We report our results on the development of the Peterson olefination using gem&#8208;borylsilylmethane derivatives to synthesize di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted vinyl boronates. We show that the electronic properties of the carbonyl partner have no effect on the Peterson/boron&#8208;Wittig chemoselectivity whereas the nature of the silane group plays an important role. A DFT study helps explain observed reactivity, chemoselectivity and stereoseletivity

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of n&#8208;Nonanal and Aldehyde&#8208;Containing Polysiloxanes via Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroformylation Enhanced by A New Silicon&#8208;Tethered Multidentate Phosphine Ligand</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of two tetradentate P&#8208;ligands based on the 2,4,6,8&#8208;tetravinyl&#8208;2,4,6,8&#8208;tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane (ViD4) and tetrakis(dimethyl(vinyl)silyl) silicate (SiV4) was reported for application in Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation of alkenes, which provide a facile process for the catalytic synthesis of long&#8208;chain alkyl aldehydes and aldehyde&#8208;functional polysiloxanes with good regioselectivity.







Abstract
Catalytic synthesis of long&#8208;chain alkyl aldehydes presents a significant challenge in homogeneous catalysis and organic synthesis due to the difficulty in regioselective control. Here we report a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed high chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective hydroformylation of 1&#8208;octene that would be highly useful intermediates in chemical industry. Notably, the easy made tetradentate P&#8208;ligands L1 and L2 can effectively suppress hydrogenation and isomerization reaction of olefins and give the desired aldehydes in high yield and good regioselectivity. Control experiments reveal the tetradentate P&#8208;ligands is important for controlling selectivity because the high regioselectivity is found to benefit from the presence of four phosphorus atoms manifesting in the formation of much more efficient coordination interactions to give relatively stable rhodium complexes.

         <title>Full&#8208;color Fluorescence Solvatochromism of Push&#8208;pull Type Indenoindene Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Full&#8208;color fluorescence solvatochromism was demonstrated using two carbon&#8208;bridged oligo(phenylenevinylene) (COPV) derivatives Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)&#8208;COCH3 and [Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)]2CO with a push&#8211;pull system, where the donor and acceptor moieties are diphenylamino and a carbonyl group, respectively. In non&#8208;polar cyclohexane, the molecules exhibited blue photoluminescence (&#955;PL = 443 and 464 nm) with a locally excited character, while in polar solvents, a charge&#8208;transfer character emerged. In methanol, red emission was observed (&#955;PL = 602 and 572 nm). The difference in luminescence maxima between cyclohexane and methanol corresponds to 0.74 and 0.59 eV for Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)&#8208;COCH3 and [Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)]2CO, respectively, which are larger than those of previously reported push&#8211;pull systems. The photoluminescence quantum yields of Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)&#8208;COCH3 in aprotic solvents were 0.90 and higher regardless of solvent polarity, while they decreased in protic solvents. The molecules also display high extinction coefficients of up to 2.8 x 104 and 6.4 x 104 M&#8315;&#185;cm&#8315;&#185;. These data demonstrate the effectiveness of the use of structurally rigid planar COPV framework. Furthermore, [Ph2N&#8208;COPV1(Bu)]2CO showed significant responses to water content in tetrahydrofuran&#8208;water mixed solvents, which highlights its potential for sensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Multicomponent Reactions Mediated by Supramolecular Containers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multicomponent reactions (MCRs) have drawn great attention due to their various significant advantages including highly effective, environment&#8208;friendly, and atom&#8208;economic. Developing more efficient and selective MCRs is of great significance to construct chemical libraries of potential functional compounds. On the other hand, supramolecular containers have been successfully applied as novel nanoreactors to mediate diverse organic transformations, and MCRs are included. In this review, examples of supramolecular container mediated MCRs have been summarized. The supramolecular containers include &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD), &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CD), calix[4]arene, self&#8208;assembled Ga(III)&#8208;ligand tetrahedral coordination cage ([Ga4L6]12&#8722;), and decanuclear 3d&#8208;4f lanthanide metal&#8208;organic cage ([Zn2Yb8(L)8Cl2]2+). The MCRs cover Hantzsch, Biginelli, Aza&#8208;Darzens, Strecker, and other three&#8208;component reactions. Effects of the supramolecular containers have been illustrated and prospects for the future are also provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Sustainable Total Synthesis and Chiral Pool Strategies with Emphasis on (&#8722;)&#8208;Sclareol in Natural Products Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There are continuous efforts to improve total syntheses of natural products, particularly their sustainability, such as developing effective chiral pool approaches relying on a wide spectrum of natural chirons, including (&#8722;)&#8208;sclareol as one of the most useful natural chirons. Here, we analyze recent developments in sustainable total synthesis and cutting&#8208;edge chiral pool strategies while focusing on the synthesis of a broad range of complex and bioactive molecules from (&#8722;)&#8208;sclareol though various key intermediates.







Abstract
Starting materials for sustainable total synthesis often come from the chiral pool: carbohydrates, cyclitols, amino acids, and terpenes. In the terpene family, (&#8722;)&#8208;sclareol has served as a sustainable, readily available, and versatile chiral building block for the synthesis of numerous natural products. (&#8722;)&#8208;Sclareol possesses a unique structure that has consequently promoted its integration as a core framework within various structurally complex and biologically active substances, including sesquiterpenoids, diterpenoids, and sesterterpenoids. (&#8722;)&#8208;Sclareol has facilitated access to diverse synthetic key intermediates, promoting the sustainable synthesis of several natural products. Herein, a review is presented covering the recent trends in sustainable total syntheses and the application of chiral pool approaches with emphasis on the preparation of natural products through diverse routes employing (&#8722;)&#8208;sclareol as chiral educt. Innovative catalytic and synthetic protocols using (&#8722;)&#8208;sclareol are also analyzed and discussed.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Multicomponent Reactions of Indoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indoles, which are distinguished by their nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic structure, play a pivotal role in organic chemistry due to their diverse biological profiles and unique chemical reactivity. In particular, poly&#8208;substituted indoles are extensively found in a wide range of natural products, pharmaceuticals, materials, and bioactive compounds. The integration of indoles into multicomponent reactions (MCRs) has emerged as a powerful synthetic strategy, facilitating the construction of these complex poly&#8208;substituted indole frameworks from simple precursors. This review highlights the latest advancements in MCRs involving indoles, focusing on innovative methodologies for site&#8208;selective synthesis of indole derivatives, catalytic systems, mechanistic insights, and their applications. The review encompasses significant developments from 2014 to 2024 and covers a variety of indole MCRs, including those targeting the C3 position, dual&#8208;site reactions at the C2 and C3 positions, and reactions involving the pyrrole and benzene rings of the indole scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>5&#8208;Substituted 1,2&#8208;Dihydroxyindolizidines and &#8208;Pyrrolizidines Related to Swainsonine: Synthesis and Inhibition Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of selective Golgi &#945;&#8208;mannosidase II inhibitors possessing a modified swainsonine skeleton has recently become a popular field of study due to their great potential in suppressing metastasis. However, most of the studied modifications involve addition of a substituent on the bicycle which makes the synthesis rather complex as five stereogenic centres have to be generated. Inspired by our previously developed synthesis of (5S)&#8208;5&#8208;benzylswainsonines utilizing a fully stereoselective intramolecular reductive amination, we decided to further investigate the versatility of this strategy by preparing a small collection of simplified analogues bearing only two hydroxy groups, thus eliminating one of the stereogenic centres. This contribution reports a concise synthesis of 5&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;dihydroxyindolizidines and &#8208;pyrrolizidines whose key features include small number of steps, high yields and excellent stereoselectivity. The title compounds were also tested for inhibitory activity against a Golgi and a lysosomal &#945;&#8208;mannosidase to assess the effects of the substituents, ring size and missing C8&#8208;hydroxyl on potency and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new carbon monoxide surrogate with high CO loading based on the abundant and polyhydroxylated mannitol has been developed. Its efficacy was demonstrated in the palladium&#8208;catalyzed alkoxycarbonylation of aryl bromides and a series of aromatic esters were produced in moderate to good yields with phenols as the nucleophiles.







Abstract
Carbonylative transformation is already been accepted as a powerful toolbox in synthetic chemistry. However, the manipulation of toxic and smell&#8208;less carbon monoxide gas lagged it from wide range applications. Hence the developing of new and efficient CO surrogates become an attractive topic. Herein, we developed a novel mannitol&#8208;based carbon monoxide surrogate with an enhanced carbon monoxide loading capacity compared to known organic carbon monoxide surrogates. We successfully used it in the palladium&#8208;catalyzed alkoxycarbonylation of aryl bromides with phenols only 0.5 equivalent of it required. This newly designed carbon monoxide surrogate offers additional possibility for further development in CO chemistry.

         <title>Synthesis of Benzoxazoles by Metal&#8208;Free Oxidative Cyclization of Catechols with Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extremely simple strategy for constructing benzoxazoles via the direct oxidative cyclization of easily accessible catechols and primary amines is achieved using two complement oxidative systems. The DDQ/EA system provides a powerful route for 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl benzoxazoles synthesis, while the O2/water system proved to be more effective for constructing 2&#8208;alkyl benzoxazoles, thereby making it indisputably the simplest method for benzoxazole synthesis.







Abstract
Benzoxazoles are crucial in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and functional materials. Their simple, economical, green, and efficient synthesis has attracted long&#8208;standing interest in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we present an extremely simple strategy for constructing benzoxazoles via the direct oxidative cyclization of readily available catechols and primary amines, using DDQ/EA and O&#8322;/water oxidative systems, respectively. The DDQ/EA system demonstrates distinct advantages in substrate and functional group compatibility. In contrast, the O&#8322;/water system, which is milder, greener, and more economical, excels in synthesizing C&#8208;2 alkyl&#8208;substituted benzoxazoles. Overall, these two systems provide complementary advantages and are both well&#8208;suited for gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Given its high simplicity and practicality, this strategy could serve as a promising alternative in benzoxazole synthesis.

         <title>Urea as an Amine Source to Synthesize Primary Aromatic Amines via Nickel&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;H Amination</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A straightforward and efficient method has been developed for the transformation of aromatic CAr&#8722;H bond into CAr&#8722;NH&#8322; via nickel&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H activation, eliminating the need for additional protection and deprotection steps. This strategy employs 8&#8208;aminoquinoline as a directing group and urea as the nitrogen source, a non&#8208;toxic, inexpensive, and stable bulk chemical. The reaction exhibits high selectivity, exclusively yielding mono&#8208;aminated primary aromatic amines. Furthermore, the protocol is tolerant of a wide range of substrates with various functional groups, producing the corresponding ortho&#8208;aminobenzamides in yields ranging from 38% to 73%. The preliminary results indicate the C&#8211;H bond cleavage is likely the rate&#8208;determining step in the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Depolymerization of Aromatic and Aliphatic Polyesters Using Me3SiI</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the absence of any catalyst, polyester plastic wastes are depolymerized with Me3Si&#8722;I into a variety of value&#8208;added compounds. The reaction outcomes and the nature of the end products are influenced by the solvent, the temperature, the amount of Me3SiI and the length of the carbon backbone between the carboxyl fragments.







Abstract
Iodotrimethylsilane (Me3SiI) promotes the depolymerization of a variety of alkyl and aromatic polyesters, such as poly(ethylene succinate) (PES), polylactic acid (PLA) as well as polyethylene and polybutylene terephthalates (PET, PBT), in the absence of catalyst. The monomer products, e.&#8201;g. the silylester monomers and/or their value&#8208;added derivatives, involving reactive iodo groups (alkyl iodides and acyl iodides), are obtained in high yields. The reaction outcomes are influenced by the solvent (e.&#8201;g. CH2Cl2, CH3CN), temperature (25&#8201;&#176;C to 200&#8201;&#176;C) and the amount of Me3SiI. The depolymerization of PES gives the corresponding silylester which then cyclizes into succinic anhydride. With PLA, the ester CH3CH2CO2SiMe3 and propionyl iodide (CH3CH2COI) are formed. They can be selectively obtained by adjusting the reaction conditions. As expected, the decomposition of aromatic polymers PET and PBT affords the bis(trimethylsilyl) terephthalate compound (1,4&#8208;{CO2SiMe3}2C6H4). In the case of PET, the formation of the latter species is hampered by the I2, released by the decomposition of the generated diiodoethane. The initial addition of an iodine trap (1&#8208;pentyne) avoids these side reactions.

     alt="Catalyst-Free Depolymerization of Aromatic and Aliphatic Polyesters Using Me3SiI"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of any catalyst, polyester plastic wastes are depolymerized with Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&#8722;I into a variety of value-added compounds. The reaction outcomes and the nature of the end products are influenced by the solvent, the temperature, the amount of Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiI and the length of the carbon backbone between the carboxyl fragments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iodotrimethylsilane (Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiI) promotes the depolymerization of a variety of alkyl and aromatic polyesters, such as poly(ethylene succinate) (&lt;b&gt;PES&lt;/b&gt;), polylactic acid (&lt;b&gt;PLA&lt;/b&gt;) as well as polyethylene and polybutylene terephthalates (&lt;b&gt;PET&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;PBT&lt;/b&gt;), in the absence of catalyst. The monomer products, &lt;i&gt;e.&#8201;g&lt;/i&gt;. the silylester monomers and/or their value-added derivatives, involving reactive iodo groups (alkyl iodides and acyl iodides), are obtained in high yields. The reaction outcomes are influenced by the solvent (&lt;i&gt;e.&#8201;g&lt;/i&gt;. CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN), temperature (25&#8201;&#176;C to 200&#8201;&#176;C) and the amount of Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiI. The depolymerization of &lt;b&gt;PES&lt;/b&gt; gives the corresponding silylester which then cyclizes into succinic anhydride. With &lt;b&gt;PLA&lt;/b&gt;, the ester CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and propionyl iodide (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;COI) are formed. They can be selectively obtained by adjusting the reaction conditions. As expected, the decomposition of aromatic polymers &lt;b&gt;PET&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;PBT&lt;/b&gt; affords the bis(trimethylsilyl) terephthalate compound (1,4-{CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). In the case of &lt;b&gt;PET&lt;/b&gt;, the formation of the latter species is hampered by the I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, released by the decomposition of the generated diiodoethane. The initial addition of an iodine trap (1-pentyne) avoids these side reactions. This work demonstrates that the length of the carbon chain linking the carboxylic acid units is a crucial factor influencing the ease of the reaction and the nature of the products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Addition and Substitution Reactions with Grignard Reagents: Do We Know It All?</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses advancements in catalytic asymmetric conjugate additions with Grignard reagents, emphasising both established knowledge and unexplored areas. Metal catalysis is crucial for forming enantioselective carbon&#8208;carbon bonds in organic synthesis. Key factors such as metal source, ligands, substrates, temperature, and solvent have been well&#8208;studied. Recent computational chemistry insights have elucidated reaction mechanisms and critical steps.







Abstract
Catalysis has been a cornerstone in organic synthesis, enabling a variety of highly efficient and selective C&#8722;C bond formation reactions, in particular enantioselective addition and substitution of Grignard reagents. Throughout time, we have gained significant understanding into how various factors, such as the influence of the metal source, the nature of the ligands, the substrates or temperature, affect these processes. Recent advances in computational chemistry have further enriched our understanding of this chemistry by elucidating the potential reaction mechanism and providing insight into the rate and enantio&#8208;determining steps in these catalytic transformations. However, challenges persist, and aspects such as ligand optimisation, full mechanistic understanding and scalability remain underexplored. Computational methods, however, present a remarkable potential to surmount these enduring challenges.

         <title>Amino Acid&#8208;Mediated Enantioselective Synthesis of a Bicyclic Ketocarbaldehyde: Theoretical and Experimental Insights into a Key Intermediate for Some Polycyclic Diterpene Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective cyclization of a diketoaldehyde mediated by l&#8208;amino acids produces a (R)&#8208;bicyclic ketocarbaldehyde via a two&#8208;step mechanism involving cyclization and dehydration. Systematic optimization, real&#8208;time monitoring (NMR, MS), X&#8208;ray structural analysis, and computational studies reveal the reaction intermediates, transition states, and factors influencing enantioselectivity and yield.







Abstract
A study on the amino acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular cyclization of diketoaldehyde 2 to form bicyclic ketocarbaldehyde 1, a potentially useful intermediate in the synthesis of some polycyclic diterpenes, is hereafter presented. This cyclization exhibits a peculiar enantio&#8208;selectivity if compared to similar intramolecular cyclizations due to its product being the (S)&#8208;enantiomer when using d&#8208;amino acids. Our findings reveal that the transformation proceeds through two irreversible steps: the cyclization and the subsequent dehydration process. The reaction enantiomeric excess (e.e.) was optimized by systematically varying the amino acids, solvents, and acids used. Aldol intermediates were successfully isolated. The structure of the most abundant one was confirmed by X&#8208;ray analysis, which supported the proposed reaction mechanism. NMR and MS were employed to monitor in real&#8208;time the formation and the evolution of these intermediates. This approach allowed us to detect the key species that contribute to the enantioselectivity and yield of the final product. Additionally, the transition state energies associated with the formation of the eight possible aldol intermediates were examined through computational studies, further elucidating the mechanistic pathway of this enantioselective cyclization.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereo&#8208;Selective Ring Opening of Cyclopropenes with Triflic Acid: en Route to Vinyl Triflates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vinyl triflates were obtained via triflic acid&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening of cyclopropenes with excellent site&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity, which were used for synthesizing various trisubstituted conjugated olefins via palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling with boronic acids. An intramolecular halogen migration reactivity was observed for specific substrates, which provides an alternative method to access the valuable vinyl chloride and bromide.







Abstract
Herein, we report a triflic acid&#8208;mediated ring opening of cyclopropenes, affording vinyl triflates with high regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity. An intramolecular halogen transfer reactivity was also observed in this reaction, offering a tool to access the valuable vinyl chloride and bromide. The vinyl triflate products are applicable to palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross coupling reactions, delivering various trisubstituted olefins and dienes with moderate yields.

         <dc:description>The development of phosphinidene precursors capable of releasing free phosphinidenes holds great potential in exploiting their reactivity with small molecules and enthalpically strong bonds. We report the facile cleavage of dichalcogenide bonds, including S&#8208;S, Se&#8208;Se and Te&#8208;Te bonded complexes over the phosphorus center of a bisphosphirane&#8208;fused anthracene (1), which produces a variety of phosphonodichalcogenides (2&#8208;4). We also show the ambiphilic nature of 1. The reaction of 1 with nucleophiles, such as 1,3&#8208;bis(isopropyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IiPr) and 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl isocyanide (DipNC) gives a phosphinidene adduct of IiPr and a 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;3&#8208;azaallene, respectively. Treatment of 1 with trimethylsilyl azide (TMSN3) affords an iminophosphanide, manifesting the nucleophilic nature of 1.

         <title>Catalytic Reactions of Alkynyl Sulfides: Versatile Tools in Synthetic Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkynyl sulfides, a significant class of heteroatom&#8208;substituted alkynes, have garnered considerable attention within the synthetic community because of their distinctive characteristics, such as the enhanced reactivity, precise selectivity control, and facile derivatization via C&#8208;S bond couplings. Their transformations can provide a direct access to functionalized organosulfur and even sulfur&#8208;free compounds in a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective manner, which is very attractive for many fields, including organic synthesis, material science, medicinal chemistry, and life science. This review summarizes the recent progresses on catalytic reactions of  alkynyl sulfides, such as the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed controllable functionalizations, including hydro&#8208;, hetero&#8208;, and carbofunctionalizations, electrophilic additions, radical addition&#8208;initiated functionalizations, and formal [2+n] cycloadditions, in which the reaction mechanism, selectivity control, scope and limitations are discussed in detail. Given the rapidly increasing interests and applications of sulfur&#8208;containing compounds in both chemistry and life science, it can be anticipated that this review will be valuable for synthetic chemists and may contribute further development of the alkynyl sulfide chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the &#945;&#8208;Hydrazination (&#945;&#8208;Amination) of Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrophilic &#945;&#8208;hydrazination (generally referred to as &#945;&#8208;amination) of carbonyl compounds with dialkyl azodicarboxylates is a powerful approach for the preparation of synthetically useful intermediates such as &#945;&#8208;amino aldehydes and ketones, &#945;&#8208;amino acids, and &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols. Many methods for the enantioselective &#945;&#8208;hydrazination have been published in the past and many new approaches have been disclosed in the last decade that deal with previously unresolved issues such as the direct enantioselective &#945;&#8208;hydrazination of &#945;&#8208;branched ketones. The enantioselective &#945;&#8208;hydrazination is the field where most significant advances have been attained thanks to new approaches, catalysts and techniques. With this review we intend to cover the literature that appeared between 2015 and 2024. We will classify the various methods according to the strategies for the enantioselective formation of the new C&#8208;N bond, mainly based on the formation of chiral enamines, enols and enolates. Miscellaneous methods are grouped at the end of the review. Where relevant, the application of &#945;&#8208;hydrazino carbonyl compounds to the synthesis of target molecules will also be illustrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances on Light&#8208;Mediated Nitrene Transfer Reactions: An Emerging Area</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen atoms are fundamental in biological systems and are widely found in approved drugs, natural products, and materials. Thus, catalytic methods for the C&#8208;N bond formation have attracted significant attention in synthetic chemistry. Among the toolbox, nitrene transfer reaction is one of the powerful protocols for the construction of N&#8208;incorporating frameworks with structural diversity. In this field, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer reactions have been extensively explored using different types of precursors. On the other hand, photochemistry offers a sustainable protocol in synthetic chemistry, which has emerged as an eco&#8208;friendly catalytic method in nitrene chemistry, particularly, with the induction of visible light as the initiator in this area. In the last decade, a variety of visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated synthetic transformations involving free nitrene species have been reported under mild reaction conditions. Thus, it is timely and highly desirable to summarize the advancements in this area. This review summarized the advances in photo&#8208;mediated nitrene transfer reactions from 1950s to 2024, which is organized into two sections according to the protocols for the nitrene formation: (i) direct photolysis of diverse nitrene precursors and (ii) photocatalytic generation of free nitrenes. The detailed reaction mechanisms and synthetic potential are the main focus in this review article.</dc:description>

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted Multicomponent Synthesis of Spirooxindole Dihydropyridine Bisphosphonates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 6, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new, simple, catalyst&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free microwave&#8208;assisted multicomponent method was developed for the synthesis of spirooxindole dihydropyridine bisphosphonates as a new family of compounds by the one&#8208;pot reaction of isatins, &#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates and primary amines. A proposed mechanism for the reaction was also provided along with DFT calculations, and the iminophosphonate as a key intermediate was also isolated and characterized.







Abstract
A new, simple, catalyst&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free microwave (MW)&#8208;assisted multicomponent method was elaborated for the synthesis of spirooxindole dihydropyridine bisphosphonates as a new family of compounds by the one&#8208;pot reaction of isatins, &#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates and primary amines. The synthesis was carefully optimized in respect of the molar ratio of the starting materials, the heating mode, the temperature, the reaction time and the effect of different catalysts. The substrate scope of the synthesis was also investigated, and the novel title compounds could be prepared in moderate to good yields. A proposed mechanism for the multicomponent reaction was also provided, in which the iminophosphonate compound could mean a key intermediate through the formation of the desired spiro derivatives.

         <title>Case Studies of Dimensionality in Chemical Data</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 6, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we use kinetic data dimension analysis, which is grounded in chemical reaction network theory, to analyze reaction monitoring data and extract the number of linearly independent reactions. We demonstrate the power of this approach for mechanism elucidation on 4 case studies with experimental data from the literature by deriving new insights.







Abstract
The ambition to relate intrinsic features of chemical data to the underlying chemical reaction networks (CRNs) is not new, but has experienced only modest success. This may partly be attributed to a lack of theoretical groundwork connecting idealized theory to actual experimental data with added complexity. In particular: i)&#8197;many CRNs have species that cannot be directly observed experimentally; ii)&#8197;the apparent number of underlying reactions is a function of the resolution of the data; iii)&#8197;chemical phenomena can change the number of discernable independent processes of the data. In this work, we illustrate the application of the recently introduced concept of data dimension, which quantifies the linearly independent dimensions the system composition in a CRN can change. We perform case studies inspecting the dimensionality of chemical data characterizing CRNs, and outline how it can be used for mechanistic interpretation. In some instances, these extended considerations allow us to directly recover the CRN proposed in the literature without any fitting. This demonstrates that, with incomplete information, important clues about CRN structure can still be recovered. Additionally, our approach detects critical subtleties, preventing important candidate reactions from being discarded in mechanistic studies.

         <title>Directing&#8208;Group&#8208;Assisted Markovnikov Hydroximation of Styrenes Enabled by Photoredox/Cobalt Dual&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 6, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple photoredox/cobalt dual&#8208;catalytic approach has been reported for directing&#8208;group&#8208;assisted Markovnikov hydroximation of styrenes under mild conditions, avoiding the use of strong acids, stoichiometric oxidants and reductants.







Abstract
By the combination of acridinium salt as a photocatalyst and cobaloxime complex as a co&#8208;catalyst, a simple and mild approach has been developed for the directing&#8208;group&#8208;assisted Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydroximation of styrenes under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Herein, the directing&#8208;group on styrenes plays an important role for this transformation. Although the substrate scope seems to be limited, such an approach features excellent regioselectivity and high atom economy. In contrast with previous methodologies, this photoredox/cobalt dual&#8208;catalytic system is operationally simple, and avoids the use of any other sacrificial reagents.

&lt;p&gt;By the combination of acridinium salt as a photocatalyst and cobaloxime complex as a co-catalyst, a simple and mild approach has been developed for the directing-group-assisted Markovnikov-selective hydroximation of styrenes under visible-light irradiation. Herein, the directing-group on styrenes plays an important role for this transformation. Although the substrate scope seems to be limited, such an approach features excellent regioselectivity and high atom economy. In contrast with previous methodologies, this photoredox/cobalt dual-catalytic system is operationally simple, and avoids the use of any other sacrificial reagents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photolabile ortho&#8208;Nitro&#8208;Benzyl Carbonate as an Amino Protecting Group for Stereocontrolled Synthesis of 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;2&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;Glycosides</title>

         <dc:description>
The photolabile ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl carbonate (oNBC) was described as an amino protecting group for stereocontrolled synthesis of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glycosides. Under irradiation at 365&#8197;nm, deprotection of the multiple O&#8208; and N&#8208;oNBC protecting groups of glycosides was effectively achieved with aminomethyl polystyrene (P&#8208;CH2NH2) as the carbonyl scavenger.







Abstract
Traditional amino protecting groups are often removed under harsh conditions or incompatible with other protecting groups, rendering the synthesis of complex 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glycosides difficult. Here, we utilize the photolabile ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl carbonate (oNBC) as an amino protecting group for stereocontrolled synthesis of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glycosides. The gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation with per&#8208;O&#8208;oNBC&#8208;protected 2&#8208;N&#8208;phthaloyl (Phth)&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;, 2&#8208;N&#8208;trichloroacetyl (TCA)&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;, and 2&#8208;N&#8208;oNBC&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;glycosyl ynenoates proceeded smoothly to provide 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy glycosides with exclusive &#946;&#8208;selectivities via the neighboring group participation (NGP) effect. Removal of the multiple O&#8208; and N&#8208;oNBC protecting groups of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy glycosides was achieved under irradiation at 365&#8197;nm with aminomethyl polystyrene as the carbonyl scavenger.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Alkylsulfonylation of 1&#8208;Acryloyl&#8208;2&#8208;Cyanoindoles with Hantzsch Esters through Sulfur Dioxide Insertion</title>

A three&#8208;component radical relay reaction of 1&#8208;acryloyl&#8208;2&#8208;cyanoindoles with 4&#8208;alkyl Hantzsch esters and Na2S2O5 to access alkylsulfonyl pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indoledione derivatives has been developed.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component alkylsulfonylation/cyclization/hydrolysis relay reaction of 1&#8208;acryloyl&#8208;2&#8208;cyanoindoles with 4&#8208;alkyl Hantzsch esters and Na2S2O5 involving sulfur dioxide insertion has been established to access a series of alkylsulfonyl pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]indolediones derivatives. With this method, a variety of primary and secondary alkyl radicals can be used for trapping sulfur dioxide and the corresponding alkylsulfonyl radical intermediates formed in&#8197;situ, followed by alkyl sulfonyl radical addition, cyclization and hydrolysis. This reaction involves selective cleavage of a carbon&#8208;carbon bond followed by successive formation of three new chemical bonds, in which the cyano group has dual roles as a radical acceptor and a carbonyl source.

         <title>Diastereoselective Entry to Novel Aminoindolizidines with Fused Furan, Thiophene, and Pyrrole Ring Starting from L&#8208;Glutamic Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 6, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of novel aminoindolizidines fused to (tetrahydro)furan, thiophene or pyrrole nuclei were synthesized using a concise and diastereoselective approach from optically pure tricyclic heteroaryl&#8208;indolizidinols as key substrates. The synthesis involved Jurjew&#8208;type skeletal rearrangement, Staudinger reduction, Thompson azidation and Ra&#8722;Ni mediated diastereoselective catalytic hydrogenation. Overall, aminoindolizidines were synthesized in 6&#8211;8 steps from L&#8208;glutamic acid and heteroaryl carbaldehyde.







Abstract
A series of novel optically pure aminoindolizidines featuring fused tetrahydro&#8208;furan, thiophene, or pyrrole ring were synthesized from the proteinogenic L&#8208;glutamic acid as a chiral precursor and a nitrogen atom source. The synthetic sequence employed tricyclic indolizidinols as advanced building blocks, which were prepared on a gram&#8208;scale from bioavailable reagents. Key transformations within the used synthetic sequence included diastereoselective Thompson azidation, Staudinger reduction, Jurjew reaction, and highly diastereoselective catalytic hydrogenation. These steps facilitated the efficient and stereoselective synthesis of the ultimate amino&#8208; and N&#8208;acetylamino&#8208;indolizidines.

         <title>Multicomponent Modular Synthesis of Thioacetals by Using Dichloromethane as the C1 Synthon Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 6, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot multicomponent strategy for the modular synthesis of a series of thioacetals by using stable and abundant feedstock chemical DCM as a C1 source was developed. This work provides not only an excellent complementary strategy to the established thioacetals synthesis, but also a new platform for DCM application.







Abstract
Thioacetals are an important category of sulfur&#8208;containing compounds and versatile building blocks. Therefore, there is growing demand for the development of practical and modular methods to access various thioacetals from inexpensive and readily available commodity chemicals. Herein, we describe a novel one&#8208;pot multicomponent protocol for thioacetals synthesis, especially benzylthio thioacetals synthesis, by employing feedstock chemical dichloromethane (DCM) as the C1 source under metal&#8208;free, mild and simple conditions. Furthermore, its synthetic utility is further demonstrated by the preparation of deuterated thioacetals, large&#8208;scale synthesis and broad functional group compatibility. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate the dual roles of DBU as both a proton scavenger and a nucleophilic catalyst. This work provides not only an excellent complementary strategy to the established thioacetals synthesis, but also a new platform for DCM application.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of 4&#8208;Aminotriazoles Through Click Cycloaddition and Generation of Iodonium(III) Triazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 6, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for synthesizing 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles was established through sequential click cycloaddition and aminations mediated by triazolyl(Mes)iodonium salts. This method employs a copper&#8208;catalyzed process, characterized by mild conditions, a broad substrate scope, and straightforward operational procedures. The method facilitates the efficient construction of substituted aminotriazoles through both stepwise and one&#8208;pot syntheses. The practical synthesis of triazolyliodonium salts as stable solids is expected to enable further derivatizations.







Abstract
The divergent synthesis of 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles was accomplished through the Cu&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition of organic azides with alkynyliodonium(III) salts, followed by Cu&#8208;catalyzed triazole&#8208;amine coupling involving treatment with amines and amides. The in&#8197;situ formation of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole iodonium salts is crucial to this approach, and the utilization of a Cu&#8208;catalyst facilitates cycloaddition and C&#8722;N bond formation. The synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;triazolyliodonium(III) salts proposed in this study offers advantages, including mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, and operational simplicity, while also providing efficient access to a complex and diverse range of 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole derivatives.

         <dc:description>
A novel and efficient method for constructing gem&#8208;difluoroallylic ketones via photo&#8208;induced selective carbonyl&#8722;C(sp3) bond cleavage of &#946;&#8208;ketone alcohols is reported. This method maintains excellent functional group tolerance and the resulting products can be readily transformed into other valuable chemical molecules. Moreover, mechanism studies indicate that this reaction initiates with a C&#8722;C bond &#946;&#8208;scission, generating carbon radicals through a PCET event.







Abstract
A photoinduced reaction for the formation of gem&#8208;difluoroallylic ketones via selective &#946;&#8208;scission of &#946;&#8208;ketone alcohols with &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes is described. This process demonstrates a broad substrate scope for both &#946;&#8208;ketone alcohols and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes. The reaction is proposed to proceed via an intramolecular PCET mechanism. The core of the strategy involves the oxidative cleavage of the carbonyl &#8211; C(sp3) bond in &#946;&#8208;ketone alcohols, facilitated by a base, to release acyl radicals, followed by the rapid addition of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes. Additionally, various downstream transformations were carried out with these compounds in a one&#8208;step operation. This protocol is also applicable to corresponding alkynylation and Minisci reactions.

         <title>Benzoisoxazoles as Privileged Scaffolds in the Design and Synthesis of N&#8208;containing Molecules: A Recent Update</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 6, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exponential increase in the use of benzoisoxazoles as cycloaddition partners and amination reagents for the synthesis of highly valuable nitrogen&#8208;containing molecular scaffolds, particularly N&#8208;heterocycles, has garnered considerable attention. This review summarizes key advances from 2015 to 2024 in transformations of 2,1&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;benzoisoxazoles, with a focus on mechanisms, catalyst selectivity, and synthetic scope, while also addressing current challenges and future prospects.







Abstract
Benzoisoxazoles, with a distinctive 10&#8208;&#960;&#8208;electron system and significant polarity, readily trigger N&#8722;O bond cleavage, enabling multifaceted applications in organic synthesis. Over the past decade, the exponentially increased use of benzoisoxazoles towards the synthesis of highly valuable N&#8208;containing scaffolds, especially N&#8208;heterocycles, has garnered substantial attention. In this review, we summarize recent developments in the transformation of 2,1&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;benzoisoxazoles since 2015, highlighting the neglected resemblances of these two nitroxy heterocycles. Key processes in the assorted reactions of benzoisoxazoles, including mechanisms, scope, catalyst&#8208;controlled chemodivergence, current limitations, and developmental prospects, are also introduced and discussed.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 6, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vilsmeier&#8208;Haack reaction is an important tool to synthesize &#946;&#8208;halovinyl aldehyde which is a ptential aldo&#8208;x bifunctional building block (AXB3). Multiple reactive sites and high reactivity of formyl group and vinylic/benzylic halogen makes them fast reacting electrophiles offering fertile land for diverse organic transformations. In this review, we have assembled all the contributions from mid&#8208;2007 to Jan 2024.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;halovinyl aldehydes serve as a valuable building blocks in organic synthesis. These aldo&#8208;x bifunctional building blocks (AXB3s) contain a alkenic double bond (vinyl) as well as a formyl group along with a halogen atom (Cl, Br, I) bonded with the &#946;&#8208;carbon atom of vinyl aldehyde. Owing to the presence of these multiple reactive sites, &#946;&#8208;halovinyl aldehydes act as a suitable precursor for Michael addition, direct addition, addition&#8208;elimination reactions, cross&#8208;coupling reactions, condensation reactions, nucleophilic substitution reactions, domino reactions, MCRs, Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, functional group transformation reactions and enantioselective transformations. Therefore, a comprehensive review on synthetic exploration of &#946;&#8208;halovinyl aldehydes has been carried out for the generation of reactive intermediates and diverse bioactive heterocycles by using various C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;S and C&#8722;O bond forming reactions. In this review, we have assembled the literature from mid&#8208;2007 to Jan 2024.

         <title>Recent Advances in Allylic Fluoride Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 6, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Allylic fluorides are among the most versatile fluorinated building blocks and are frequently encountered in pharmaceutical structures. They can be categorized into two structural types: allylic monofluorides (R=H, C) and allylic gem&#8208;difluorides (R=F). This review highlights recent progress in the synthesis of allylic fluorides by metal catalysis, organocatalysis, and non&#8208;catalytic methodologies.







Abstract
The recent decades have witnessed considerable progress in the development of fluorinated&#8208;building&#8208;block strategies and direct&#8208;fluorination techniques selectively affording allylic monofluorides and gem&#8208;difluorides. For allylic monofluorides, high enantioselectivities were achieved, even for fluorinated tertiary carbons, with expanded substitution patterns on vinylic moieties enabling precise structural control over di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetrasubstituted fluorides. Advances in defluorofunctionalization and direct C&#8722;H fluorination have addressed the limitations of raw materials and made these species more accessible. Additionally, considerable progress has been achieved in the related photoredox reactions, and electrochemistry has emerged as a valuable tool for allylic fluoride synthesis. This review summarizes the recent advances in the synthesis of allylic fluorides, focusing on transition metal catalysis, organocatalysis, and noncatalytic methodologies.

         <title>Advances in C&#8722;N Bond Formation via N&#8208;Centered Radicals from N&#8208;Aminopyridinium Reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 6, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The widespread presence of nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds in natural products and chemical materials, along with their extensive applications in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, has inspired significant efforts to develop new synthetic methods for constructing C&#8722;N bonds. In this regard, Nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals (NCRs) have gained significant attention due to their high reactivity, enabling various useful transformations under mild reaction conditions. In recent years, readily accessible N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts and ylides have emerged as highly promising scaffolds for the generation of N&#8208;centered radicals under photocatalytic conditions. These pyridinium reagents can also serve as bifunctional substrates, providing a variety of useful pyridine&#8208;containing products. This review comprehensively addresses significant advances in C&#8722;N bond construction via N&#8208;centered radicals derived from N&#8208;aminopyridinium substrates, aiming to provide organic chemists with detailed insights to drive further expansion in this field.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals (NCRs) have gained significant attention due to their high reactivity, which facilitates many useful and challenging transformations, particularly in the formation of C&#8722;N bonds. In this regard, N&#8208;aminopridinium reagents are easily accessible substrates that readily generate N&#8208;centered radicals, which can be trapped by arenes, olefins, alkynes and even alkanes under visible light irradiation. In recent years, amination strategies involving N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts have grown remarkably and attracted considerable interest within the synthetic community. This review comprehensively includes all the significant advances in C&#8722;N bond construction via N&#8208;centered radicals derived from N&#8208;aminopyridinium substrates.

         <title>Photochemical&#8208;, Electrochemical&#8208;, and Photoelectrochemical&#8208; Catalyzed Hydrogen Atom Transfer from Aldehydes to Acyl Radicals and Their Transformations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 6, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical&#8208;, electrochemical&#8208;, and photoelectrochemical&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from aldehydes to acyl radicals and their transformations are presented with mechanistic insights. This review focuses on recent advances, showcasing the potential and delivering different modes of reactivity of acyl radicals as well as future perspectives of this field.







Abstract
Acyl radical has assumed an eminent position in the synthetic chemistry due to its unique and often highly reactivity. Using aldehyde as acyl radical source does not require the prefunctionalization of substrate. Furthermore, the formation of acyl radical can be achieved through a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process. In recent years, photochemical&#8208;, electrochemical&#8208;, and photoelectrochemical&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular HAT from aldehydes have been regarded as mild and sustainable routes to acyl radicals. Herein, we discuss the important advancements in the past 6&#8197;years in photo&#8208;, electro&#8208;, and photoelectro&#8208;catalyzed generation of acyl radicals from aldehydes and their applications in organic synthesis. We also highlight the mechanistic insights that have emerged from these transformations.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Azidative Functionalization of Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aliphatic azides are an important class of nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds found in numerous biologically active molecules. Besides, they also serve as useful building blocks owning to their remarkable reactivities. Catalytic azidation of alkenes is an efficient way to produce aliphatic azides. In this respect, azidated chiral molecules can be formed if a chiral catalyst is used. The last quarter of century has witnessed a burgeoning of new methods for catalytic enantioselective azidative functionalization of alkenes to yield chiral alkyl azides. In this review, we provide a summary of the development of the asymmetric azidation of alkenes systematically, from the view of reaction models (conjugate addition, &#960; activation, reductive elimination, and radical addition and atom transfer) combining the roles that azido sources play (nucleophilic, electrophilic, and radical). This review will be useful to the fields of azide chemistry and asymmetric alkene functionalization.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spirobenzoxazines are a unique class of heterocyclic compounds that combine the structural features of spiro and benzooxazine frameworks, offering enhanced chemical stability and diverse biological activities. Their rigid three&#8208;dimensional structures make them ideal candidates for interacting with biological targets, contributing to their potential in various therapeutic applications, including anticancer, antimicrobial, and enzyme inhibition. However, the development of efficient and sustainable methods for the synthesis of spirobenzoxazines remains a challenge in organic synthesis. In this work, we present a novel and environmentally friendly approach for the synthesis of spirobenzoxazine derivatives. Utilizing water as a green solvent, this methodology offers an efficient and sustainable route for constructing these complex heterocyclic frameworks. By emphasizing eco&#8208;friendly practices, this approach aligns with the principles of green chemistry, providing both high yields and operational simplicity. This advancement not only highlights the potential of spirobenzoxazines in the pharmaceutical and material sciences but also paves the way for future research in sustainable synthetic methodologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Zinc&#8208;Catalyzed Carbon&#8208;Heteroatom Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc has been an overlooked metal in catalysis for many years. However, this situation has begun to change in the last two decades with a number of contributions demonstrating that zinc salts and complexes are able to catalyze transformations typically accomplished with catalysts based on precious transition metals. The development of such zinc&#8208;catalyzed methodologies is highly appealing because, in general, zinc catalysts are easily available, inexpensive and less toxic. This Review aims to present the most recent and relevant examples of the use of zinc catalysts in the formation of carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds, which is a very important process in synthetic organic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Acceptor&#8208;Donor&#8208;Acceptor Systems Based on Indacenodithiophene&#8208;Extended Tetrathiafulvalene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we present a series of acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;D&#8208;A) conjugated molecules incorporating an indacenodithiophene&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene (IDT&#8208;TTF) as the central electron&#8208;donating moiety, functionalized with various lateral electron acceptors. A key synthetic step was the Vilsmeier&#8208;Haack formylation of the IDT&#8208;TTF, providing the dialdehyde in quantitative yield. This compound was further used for the incorporation of dicyanovinyl and indanedione acceptors. UV&#8208;vis absorption spectroscopy of the A&#8208;D&#8208;A compounds in solution revealed a broad absorption in the visible spectrum which is further red&#8208;shifted when proceeding from solutions to thin films. Their cyclic voltammograms in solution showed a multi&#8208;redox behavior &#8211; undergoing both oxidation and reduction events. Notably, the oxidation of these compounds unveiled the formation of intermolecular mixed&#8208;valence and &#960;&#8208;dimer species, especially strong in the case of the indanedione&#8208;containing derivative. Computational calculations helped us to identify the electronic transitions involved in the main absorption bands of these A&#8208;D&#8208;A compounds displaying different behaviors depending on the acceptor attached to the IDT&#8208;TTF core. Finally, the potential of these compounds as donors in organic solar cells was investigated and the best performing solar cell exhibited a modest yet promising power conversion efficiency of 0.87%.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced DNA Cleavage Using Bioinspired Photostable Flavin Analogues</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we discuss the design, synthesis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating capability and DNA cleavage activity of N10&#8208;modified flavin analogues under the blue light irradiation (452&#8197;nm). Among the flavin analogues studied, simple propylflavin (PFl) was determined to exhibit the most photostable and efficient analogue under the different conditions investigated.







Abstract
Inspired by the photosensitization capability of the naturally occurring flavin derivatives, viz. riboflavin (RF), flavin mononucleotide (FMN), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and their photodegradation susceptibility due to the presence of ribityl/phosphate group; the current manuscript investigates the N10&#8208;modified flavin analogues for their reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating capability and DNA cleavage activity, when irradiated with blue light. The effectiveness of superoxide anion generating property of photoexcited flavin analogs were determined using nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) and gallic acid quenching experiments. Among the flavin analogues studied, the simple propylflavin (PFl) was found to be most photostable and efficient in the conditions studied. The carboxyl&#8208;flavin (10Flc) displays behavior like that of FMN while the flavin&#8208;aspartic acid conjugate (FA) was found to show properties in between the PFl and the 10Flc.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Fluorinated Pyrimidine Derivatives from Aldehydes by Photocatalytic &#945;&#8208;Perfluoroalkenylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perfluoroalkylated pyrimidines simply made: By a combination of photocatalytic &#945;&#8208;alkenylation and subsequent ring closure simple aldehydes are transformed into the functionalized heterocycles. A phosphine and an imidazolidinone are both employed as catalysts in a convenient one&#8208;pot method. This way, also volatile intermediates can be successfully transformed with high functional group tolerance and efficiency.







Abstract
A straightforward, operationally simple and inexpensive one&#8208;pot synthesis of substituted 4&#8208;perfluoroalkyl&#8208;pyrimidine derivatives is reported. Employing triphenylphosphine as a photocatalyst and an additional imidazolidinone organocatalyst, aldehydes undergo &#945;&#8208;perfluoroalkenylation giving highly electron&#8208;deficient enals, which form the heterocycle upon condensation with a guanidinium salt. The method tolerates many functional groups and gives the corresponding products in up to 84&#8201;% yield over both steps.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A three&#8208;component reaction of amines, 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes, and alkyne esters for the construction of tetrahydropyrimidines and dihydropyrrolidones derivatives was reported. Shifting the substituent group of 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes led to the chemoselective synthesis. As three&#8208;atom synthons, aryl substituted 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes were applied to the regioselective synthesis of tetrahydropyrimidines. Alkyl substituted 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes working as two&#8208;atom synthons promoted intramolecular cyclization to generate dihydropyrrolidones analogues. The practicality of the developed methods was demonstrated by easy operation, catalyst&#8208;free conditions, and good functional groups tolerance.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies for modification of tryptophan residues: recent advances and future perspectives in photo&#8208;/ electrochemical&#8208;induction, and metal catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent advancements in tryptophan (Trp) modification have greatly expanded its applications across drug discovery, materials science, and environmental monitoring. Trp, an essential amino acid with a unique indole ring, serves as an ideal target for chemical modification due to its redox&#8208;active nature. Photo&#8208; and electrochemical methods, which utilize light and electric energy, respectively, offer precise, efficient, and environmentally friendly approaches for Trp modification. Photochemical&#8208;induced transformations improve Trp's optical properties, such as fluorescence, enhancing its utility in bioimaging and sensor applications, while also introducing bioactive functional groups. Electrochemical modifications enable controlled oxidation and reduction, facilitating the selective addition of functional groups like hydroxyl or amino groups, essential for synthesizing Trp derivatives aimed at protein modulation. Additionally, metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions using transition metals such as palladium or copper enable site&#8208;selective modifications through C&#8208;H activation and cross&#8208;coupling, creating Trp derivatives with enhanced properties for optoelectronic and biomedical applications. These advancements highlight the potential of Trp&#8208;based bioconjugation strategies across diverse scientific disciplines.</dc:description>

Here, we report the radical coupling from PAr3 and N&#8208;sulfonyl and N&#8208;acylaminopyridinium salts via blue&#8208;light&#8208;induced Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor (EDA) complex without photocatalyst and transition&#8208;metal. This method realizes the construction of minophosphorane through the cleavage of N&#8722;N bond, exhibiting broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Herein, we explore a visible light&#8208;enabled radical addition for the construction of N&#8208;sulfonyl and N&#8208;acyliminophosphorane using triarylphosphine and N&#8208;sulfonyl and N&#8208;acylaminopyridinium salts in the absence of transition metal, photocatalyst, oxidant or base. This method employs PAr3 as both the reaction catalyst to promote the generation of amidyl radical via N&#8722;N bond cleavage of N&#8208;sulfonyl and N&#8208;acylaminopyridinium salts, and materials for the preparation of N&#8208;sulfonyl and N&#8208;acyliminophosphorane products. This transformation exhibits abroad substrate scope and good functional group compatibility.

         <title>Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Aminoketones via Arylboronic Acid Catalyzed Decarboxylative Mannich Reactions of Enamines and &#946;&#8208;Ketoacids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An arylboronic acid&#8208;catalyzed Mannich reaction between &#946;&#8208;keto acids and enamines was developed, yielding a series of &#946;&#8208;aminoketones in 48&#8201;% to 96&#8201;% yields under mild reaction conditions, with CO2 as the only by&#8208;product.







Abstract
Herein, we report an arylboronic acid&#8208;catalyzed Mannich reaction of &#946;&#8208;ketoacids and enamines. In this transformation, the enamine served as an imine equivalent to react with the &#946;&#8208;ketoacids with the delivery of CO2 as the sole by&#8208;product. A series of &#946;&#8208;aminoketones were obtained in yields of 48&#8201;% to 96&#8201;% under mild reaction conditions with 5&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst loading. Additionally, the product was synthesized on a gram scale and further transformations were carried out. A possible catalytic cycle was proposed.

         <title>An Operationally Simple, Regioselective, Platinum&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroboration of Unactivated Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we report a simple to perform, high yielding and selective hydroboration of unactivated alkynes using a commercially available catalyst system. The reaction is tolerant towards a wide range of use functional groups and provide (E)&#8208;1,2&#8208;vinyl boronate as the major product.







Abstract
Herein is reported a new PtCl2/XPhos/Et3SiH&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration method for unactivated terminal alkynes. Significantly, the reaction proceeds in hindered alkyne systems, and works well on acetylenes that contain multiple heteroatom&#8208;groups to provide the desired (E)&#8208;1,2&#8208;vinyl boronates in reasonable to high yields with excellent levels of stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;control.

         <title>Effect of Substituents on the Tautomerism of Pyridone Nucleoside Analogs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleobase analogs are important tools in medicine and chemical biology, as they offer molecular targeting options for the intervention in genetic processes. Pyridone C&#8208;nucleosides have been shown to pair with adenine in complementary strands, but a switch from the lactam to lactim form may change their base pairing preference. We synthesized 6&#8208;fluoropyridone analogs of aciclovir and cidofovir, which we assumed to be in the lactam form, but were found to lack activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV). Spectroscopic data then indicated that they are predominantly in the lactim form, with a hydrogen bonding pattern suitable for G. The tautomerism of fluoropyridones was then studied by UV&#8208;spectroscopy and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The UV spectroscopic pattern for either tautomer was corroborated by synthesizing N&#8208; and O&#8208;methylated model compounds, and measuring their spectra. The tautomeric equilibrium of selected other substituted pyridones is predicted, based on density&#8208;functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Diethylaluminium Chloride&#8208;Mediated Cycloaddition/Conjugate Reduction Sequence towards Imido&#8208;Substituted Norbornenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diethylaluminiumchloride was shown to be an effective reagent for the stereoselective hydrogenation of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted norbornadienes. Mechanistic insights were provided by the investigation of the kinetics, NMR studies as well as deuteration experiments.







Abstract
Diethylaluminium chloride is a known Lewis acid and can undergo 1,2&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;additions, whereas conjugate reductions are mostly observed as side reactions. By serendipity we found a Et2AlCl&#8208;promoted sequential cycloaddition/conjugate hydrogenation of cyclopentadiene and 4&#8208;isopropyl&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;phenylpropioloyl) oxazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one resulting in the clean formation of the corresponding norbornene&#8208;oxazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one. NMR, kinetic and deuteration experiments provided insight into the mechanism of this reaction sequence.

&lt;p&gt;Diethylaluminiumchloride was shown to be an effective reagent for the stereoselective hydrogenation of 2,3-disubstituted norbornadienes. Mechanistic insights were provided by the investigation of the kinetics, NMR studies as well as deuteration experiments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diethylaluminium chloride is a known Lewis acid and can undergo 1,2- and 1,4-additions, whereas conjugate reductions are mostly observed as side reactions. By serendipity we found a Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AlCl-promoted sequential cycloaddition/conjugate hydrogenation of cyclopentadiene and 4-isopropyl-3-(3-phenylpropioloyl) oxazolidin-2-one resulting in the clean formation of the corresponding norbornene-oxazolidin-2-one. NMR, kinetic and deuteration experiments provided insight into the mechanism of this reaction sequence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magnetite: a Green, Sustainable and Recyclable Catalyst for Direct Synthesis of Thioesters by C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article presents a straightforward and environmentally friendly protocol for the direct synthesis of thioesters using 5&#8197;mol&#8201;% of magnetite as a catalyst. This methodology offers several advantages, including no need for prefunctionalization, broad substrate scope, scalability, operation in water or under solvent&#8208;free conditions, easy recovery of the magnetic catalyst, and high atom efficiency.







Abstract
A green and sustainable approach to the direct synthesis of thioesters has been developed using Fe3O4 as a low&#8208;cost, easily prepared, reusable and environmentally safe catalyst. The cross dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) of various thiols and aldehydes in water, or even in the absence of solvent, using tert&#8208;butylhydroperoxide as oxidant, under ligand and base&#8208;free mild conditions, afforded the corresponding thioesters in good to excellent yields. This simple protocol features broad substrate scope, good compatibility with different functional groups, as well as high atom&#8208;efficiency. The scalability, ease of (magnetic) recovery and reuse of the magnetite catalyst are additional eco&#8208;friendly attributes of this methodology. Moreover, the broad synthetic applications of thioesters further highlight the potential utility of the present protocol.

         <title>NHC&#8208;Free Ketone Synthesis via Radical Coupling Mechanisms</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ketone synthesis via radical coupling mechanisms has recently gained significant attention. Traditionally, these methods have relied on N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) to generate the key ketyl radical intermediate, either through single&#8208;electron reduction of acyl azolium or single&#8208;electron oxidation involving the Breslow intermediate. In this report, we introduce a novel photoredox protocol that directly generates ketyl radicals from stable acyl imidazoles without the need for NHCs. This approach not only simplifies the process, but also demonstrates broad tolerance for various alkyl radical substrates. Additionally, it can be extended to facilitate relay&#8208;radical coupling reactions.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organofluorine chemistry has seen rapid advancements with applications spanning agrochemicals, medicine, and materials. This review focuses on recent progress in asymmetric synthesis of CF3&#8208;bearing quaternary stereocenters from prochiral trifluoromethylated substrates, such as &#946;&#8208;CF3&#8208;&#946;&#8208;substituted nitroalkenes and &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, highlighting their utility in accessing valuable fluorinated compounds.







Abstract
At present, the research of organofluorine chemistry is a leading and rapidly emerging area of life sciences. Organofluorine molecules have drawn much attention by displaying a wide variety of applications in agrochemicals, medicines, fire extinguishers, and blowing agents. In the present review, the great advances made in the last decade for the asymmetric construction of quaternary stereocenters bearing trifluoromethyl group from the corresponding prochiral&#8208;trifluoromethylated substrates are discussed. A variety of catalytic frameworks have been designed in this field for asymmetric induction. The main prochiral&#8208;trifluoromethyl substrates chosen for this review are &#946;&#8208;CF3&#8208;&#946;&#8208;substituted nitro alkenes and &#945;, &#946;&#8208; unsaturated trifluoromethyl ketones. Moreover, this review describes the further utilization of obtained CF3&#8208;quaternary centres to access the important organofluorine molecules.

         <title>C&#8722;C Coupling of Ketones with Ethanol and Methanol Enabled by Nickel Catalysis</title>

Nickel catalysis: Herein, we have reported the application of renewable ethanol and methanol for the synthesis of 1,5&#8208;diketones enabled by Ni&#8208;catalysis. The catalytic transformations are highly sustainable and released water and dihydrogen as by products.







Abstract
Herein, we have reported the application of C1 and C2 alcohols for the C&#8722;C coupling with ketones enabled by nickel. De&#8208;hydrogenation of ethanol took place under relatively milder conditions (100&#8201;&#176;C) and resulted the functionalized 1,5&#8208;diketones with acetophenone derivatives in one pot operation. Further, multi&#8208;component strategy using ketones, and methanol in combination with various nitrogen&#8208;based nucleophiles resulted the &#945;&#8208;aminomethylation under nickel&#8208;catalysis. For a synthetic application, a series of tetra&#8208;substituted pyridines have been demonstrated. Preliminary mechanistic investigations, control experiments and deuterium labelling studies were established the interrupted borrowing hydrogen (I&#8208;BH) strategy. The catalytic transformations are highly sustainable and released water and dihydrogen as by products.

Abstract

In the syntheses of 6&#8208;H&#8208;phenaridine, the transition metal&#8208;free approach outlined in this paper is direct, convenient and easy to execute.

The synthetic utility of using 2&#8208;phenacyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;indanediones has been demonstrated by reacting with an un&#8208;symmetrical alkyne compound, such as alkyl 3&#8208;(phenylsulfonyl)propiolates to access various spiro[4.4]nonanes in a highly regioselective manner. Spiro[4.4]nonanes were further converted to extended pentafulvene &#960;&#8208;systems in an acidic medium. Photophysical properties of the synthesized sulfone&#8208;based pentafulvene dyes are also described.







Abstract
A highly regioselective synthesis of sulfone&#8208;containing spiro[4.4]nonanes has been achieved by the reaction of 2&#8208;phenacyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;indandiones with 3&#8208;(phenylsulfonyl)propiolates at ambient temperature. Furthermore, the synthesized compounds were transformed into pentafulvene dyes via unprecedented C&#8722;C bond rearrangement and their photophysical properties are also outlined in this article.

Among these approaches, halogen&#8208;mediated indirect electrosynthesis has gained significant attention as an efficient strategy for C&#8722;N bond formation, widely applied in the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds. This review highlights recent advances in direct C&#8722;N bond formation processes for various amines under halogen&#8208;mediated electrosynthetic conditions. The features, scope, limitations, and proposed mechanisms of these transformations are discussed in detail. We aim to provide insights into expanding the applicability of halogen&#8208;mediated electrosynthesis, contributing to the development of sustainable synthetic methodologies.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of a Sialic Acid&#8208;Derived Tracer for 18F&#8208;PET Multiple Sclerosis Imaging</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To contribute to the growing interest in developing selective MS imaging agents, an 18F&#8208;modified sialic acid&#8208;based PET&#8208;tracer candidate with high affinity towards myelin&#8208;associated glycoprotein (MAG) is disclosed. A multi&#8208;step synthesis of the tracer is disclosed, together preliminary validation of the radio&#8208;labeling process. In vitro studies revealed promising properties that will inform future research.







Abstract
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a leading cause of nontraumatic neurological disability in young adults, and efforts to understand disease progression continue to be intensively pursued. This is essential in order to reconcile the societal impact of this condition with the conspicuous absence of effective treatment regimes. Whilst magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revolutionized the field, enabling MS to be visualized in patients, distinguishing between other diseases that cause myelin sheath damage is a persistent challenge. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) holds great promise in differentiating neurological diseases, due to highly specific radiopharmaceuticals. To contribute to the growing interest in developing selective MS imaging agents, an 18F&#8208;modified sialic acid&#8208;based PET&#8208;tracer candidate with high affinity towards myelin&#8208;associated glycoprotein (MAG) is disclosed. Since numerous demyelination patterns are characterized by preferential MAG loss, this target scaffold is attractive in identifying lesion formation. A multi&#8208;step synthesis of the tracer is disclosed, together with preliminary validation of the radio&#8208;labeling process. In vitro experiments revealed promising properties that will inform future research.

         <title>Synthesis of Vinyl Sulfones from Substituted Alkenes via Molybdooxaziridine Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the stereoselective synthesis of vinyl sulfones from styrenes through a novel atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) mechanism. The reaction works with complete trans&#8208;alkene selectivity, high yields for substituted styrenes, and relies on sulfonylhydroxylamine as the NTs transfer reagent. This work provides a complete mechanism study for the proposed ATRA catalytic cycle.







Abstract
Herein we report the MoO2Dipic promoted sulfonation of alkenes using N&#8722;Ts&#8208;hydroxylamine as the quantitative source of Ts. The reaction works with high yields and stereoselectivities for styrenes with a wide variety of substitution patterns. A novel atom transfer radical addition mechanism involving the formation of molybdooxaziridine complex 1 as the active catalyst, difunctionalization with Ts&#8208;NO, followed by oxidation, and then elimination as the rate&#8208;determining&#8208;step for the formation of vinylsulfone 3 has been proposed. Initial kinetic and mechanistic data indicates the formation of Ts&#8208;NO and provides evidence for the proposed mechanism.

         <title>Synthesis of 4&#8208;Iodoimidazole Nucleosides: A Biocatalyzed Whole Cell Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the synthesis of 4&#8208;iodoimidazole&#8208;ribonucleoside via microbial transglycosylation using Erwinia amylovora as the whole cells biocatalyst, selected after screening our microbial collection. After all reaction parameters were optimized, the effectiveness of this biocatalyst in transglycosylation reactions with various natural and synthetic bases, as well as different sugar donor nucleosides, was confirmed.







Abstract
Nucleoside analogues are biologically active drugs that are well known for their therapeutic properties. Chemical synthesis of these compounds is complex due to time constraints, contaminant methodologies, and numerous steps involved. In contrast, biocatalyzed synthesis, particularly using microorganisms, offers many advantages. In this work, we introduce the synthesis of 4&#8208;iodoimidazole&#8208;ribonucleoside, through a microbial transglycosylation biocatalyzed by Erwinia amylovora whole cells, selected as the optimal catalyst for this biotransformation upon evaluating our microbial collection. Parameters were analyzed to optimize the reaction, and the use of this biocatalyst in transglycosylation with other natural and non&#8208;natural bases and different sugar donor nucleosides was also verified.

         <title>Regioselective Hydroformylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Esters: Impact of Reaction Parameters &amp; Reaction Optimization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydroformylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8209;unsaturated esters represents a highly atom&#8208;economical route towards &#946;&#8209;aldehydes with the potential application as precursors for derivatization to pharmaceuticals such as (R)&#8209;Baclofen or Pregabalin. Methyl 4&#8208;chlorocinnamate as an &#945;,&#946;&#8209;unsaturated ester has been rarely studied in hydroformylation, particularly with regard to a parameter screening for reaction optimization. In this work, the regioselective hydroformylation of methyl 4&#8209;chlorocinnamate to the desired &#946;&#8209;aldehyde was investigated with a particular focus on the identification of parameters with a significant effect on the regioselectivity and selectivity to the &#946;&#8209;aldehyde amongst all products. The reaction time, solvent, and catalyst loading were initially screened followed by a systematic screening using design of experiments (DoE). The reaction output was analyzed in terms of pressure, temperature and the CO/H2 composition with an unmodified Rh&#160;catalyst revealing that while either regioselectivity or overall selectivity (termed selectivity) can attain high values, neither parameter can simultaneously reach optimal levels. As predicted by the model, the experimental results under two different conditions demonstrated excellent regioselectivity (96%) with medium selectivity (57%) and a high selectivity (78&#160;%) with good regioselectivity (93%). Expansion of substrate scope revealed a significant influence of the substituents and thus the electronic effect on the regioselectivity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Thiourea Catalyzed Enantioselective Cascade Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Dihydrobenzofurans</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an enantioselective formal [4+1] annulation reaction to furnish trans&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran derivatives by using chiral thiourea catalyst. The reaction allowed to give up to 96&#8201;% yield, and up to 84&#8201;% ee with &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr.







Abstract
We established an efficient asymmetric cascade pathway for the construction of trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans. This reaction proceeds via a Michael addition followed by an oxa&#8208;substitution, employing in&#8208;situ generated pyridinium ylide and ortho&#8208;hydroxy chalcone derivatives in the presence of a chiral thiourea catalyst at ambient temperature. This method accomplishes good to excellent yields and adequate stereoselectivity, with up to 84&#8201;% ee and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 diastereomeric ratio. A key advantage of this cascade [4+1] annulation approach is its ability to construct chiral DHBs under mild conditions with notable yields and selectivity.

Abstract
An efficient organocatalytic asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation/N&#8208;hemiacetalization reaction of 2&#8208;aminoindoles with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes was developed. By incorporating an amino group at the C2 position of indole, the nucleophilicity of the C3 position of indole and the amino group were leveraged to generate an enamine&#8208;type ternary synthon. This approach enabled the construction of a range of chiral tetrahydro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;carboline skeletons with potential biological activity, delivering moderate to excellent yields (46&#8211;83&#8201;%) and achieving outstanding enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee).

         <title>Cardo Bisphenol Fluorene Fused with Dibenzo[g,p]chrysene for a High Refractive Index Monomer</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of an unexplored cardo&#8208;typed optical material showing a high refractive index of 1.83 is described. The hepta&#8208;cycle precursor wherein dibenzo[g,p]chrysene and cyclopentanone are fused together undertook double arylation to form a quaternary carbon. The resulting cardo scaffold was ranked with the primal cardo&#8208;monomer bis&#8208;phenol fluorene in chemical properties, which clarified the efficacy of dibenzo[g,p]chrysene.







Abstract
Synthesis and properties of a new cardo&#8208;typed bis&#8208;phenol are described. A dibenzo[g,p]chrysene (DBC) core that has one ester group at the bay was prepared, and then intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation gave a key cyclopentanone intermediate. Finally, two&#8208;fold arylation successfully yielded a DBC&#8208;linked bis&#8208;phenol. This new DBC&#8208;linked bis&#8208;phenol was compared with the prototype bis&#8208;phenol fluorene (BPF). The structure&#8208;activity relationship between these two bis&#8208;phenols reveals that the expansion of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system using a skeletal DBC influences the quality of its attributes with a refractive index of 1.83. This comparative study provides us a basis for future cardo structure material chemistry.

A regioselective [5+1] annulation of 2&#8208;(1H&#8208;indol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenols with isatins was established by the catalysis of Br&#248;nsted acid. Through this strategy, indole&#8208;fused chromane&#8208;based spirooxindoles bearing a quaternary carbon center were synthesized in moderate to good yields (53&#8201;% to 99&#8201;%) with excellent regioselectivities. This transformation not only provided a good example for using 2&#8208;(1H&#8208;indol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenols as 1,5&#8208;C/O&#8208;dinucleophiles in [5+1] annulations under acidic environment, but also achieved the first construction of indole&#8208;fused chromane&#8208;based spirooxindole frameworks.

Mechanism study demonstrated the importance of hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction between the N&#8722;H group of the substrates and the acid catalyst. Moreover, an indolylmethanol&#8208;type intermediate was possibly generated after the first nucleophilic addition of indole C3&#8208;position to isatins during the reaction process. This transformation not only provided a good example for using 2&#8208;(1H&#8208;indol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenols as 1,5&#8208;C/O&#8208;dinucleophiles in [5+1] annulations under acidic environment, but also achieved the first construction of indole&#8208;fused chromane&#8208;based spirooxindole frameworks.

         <title>Guaiacylglycerol as an Intermediate in Vanillin Production during Oxidative Conversion of Guaiacyl Lignin under Alkaline Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vanillin production via oxidative degradation of softwood lignin in aqueous alkali is a promising method for producing bio&#8208;based aromatic compounds. This study identifies guaiacylglycerol, an unstable intermediate previously overlooked, as a key compound formed through ether cleavage, emphasizing its significance in the vanillin production pathway.







Abstract
Depolymerizing lignin into hydroxybenzaldehydes like vanillin via oxidative degradation is a promising approach for lignin valorization. Alkaline nitrobenzene (AN) oxidation is a highly selective method for oxidative lignin conversion and serves as a benchmark in lignin chemistry, yet its reaction mechanisms are not fully understood. Previously, we proposed a pathway converting a phenolic &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model compound, erythro&#8208;guaiacylglycerol&#8208;&#946;&#8208;guaiacyl ether (GG), into vanillin through enol ether intermediates, E/Z&#8208;2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;[2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyphenoxy)&#8208;ethenyl]&#8208;phenol EE. This study extends that work by exploring alternative AN oxidation pathways of GG that bypass EE. Through experiments assessing the impact of OH&#8722; concentration and studying deuterium incorporation at the &#945;&#8208;position of vanillin produced from both GG and isolated EE in NaOD/D&#8322;O, we identified guaiacylglycerol (GGL) as a new intermediate in a distinct pathway. GGL forms via &#946;&#8208;ether cleavage of a dianion arising from dual deprotonation of GG&#8242;s phenolic and &#945;&#8208;OH groups, a process favored under high OH&#8722; concentrations conducive to dianion formation. Subsequent oxidation of GGL yields vanillin, with significant exchange of the &#945;&#8208;hydrogen with solvent molecules. This study elucidates the complex mechanisms of AN oxidation and introduces novel intermediates and pathways, enhancing strategies for efficient lignin conversion into valuable chemicals.

         <title>An approach to functionalization of cucurbit[n]uril through a tetrahydrothiopheno equatorial substituent</title>

         <dc:description>A tetrahydrothiopheno equatorial substituent on a glycoluril moiety of a cucurbit[n]uril was found to be robust and provided a capacity for reactive derivatization. We have demonstrated this on tetrahydrothiopheno substituted glycoluril derivatives as a proof of concept, then translatable reactions were applied to tetrahydrothiopheno substituted cucurbituril homologues 7 and 8. In addition to the successful derivatization tetrahydrothiophenocucurbit[7 and 8]uril, some new glycoluril derivatives have been synthesized, which may serve as future precursors for the synthesis of other substituted cucurbit[n]uril and their analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>Substitution Pattern of the Secondary Rim of ICyD Ligand Influences Stereoselectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substitution pattern of the secondary rim in NHC&#8208;capped cyclodextrin gold complexes significantly influences the reactivity and stereoselectivity of gold&#8208;catalyzed enyne cycloisomerizations. A custom&#8208;designed benzyl&#8208;methyl substitution pattern delivers the highest yields and selectivities.







Abstract
The synthesis and evaluation of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;capped cyclodextrins with various protecting groups were carried out. The corresponding gold complexes catalyze the stereoselective cycloisomerization of enynes. Permethylation of the cyclodextrin's hydroxyl groups improves yield and selectivity compared to its benzylated counterpart. Notably, alternating methyl and benzyl groups on the secondary rim of the cyclodextrin further enhances asymmetry, achieving even higher enantioselectivities. To synthesize this compound, we optimized the selective deprotection of all benzyl groups at the 2&#8208;position of the sugar residues in the cyclodextrin.

&#945;&#8208;Sulfenylated enaminones are accessible in good to excellent yields by a concise consecutive four&#8208;component alkynylation&#8208;addition&#8208;sulfenylation sequence. Most products are strongly solid&#8208;state luminescent with quantum yields up to 84&#8201;%. In addition, the absorption characteristics of selected products were rationalized via TD&#8208;DFT calculations.







Abstract
Acid chlorides, alkynes, amines, and N&#8208;thiosuccinimides react in a consecutive four&#8208;component alkynylation&#8208;addition&#8208;sulfenylation sequence to give &#945;&#8208;sulfenylated enaminones in good to excellent yields. The terminal sulfenylation step is catalyzed by Yb(OTf)3 and both N&#8208;arylthiosuccinimides and N&#8208;alkylthio succinimides can be successfully employed. Most products are solid&#8208;state luminescent with fluorescence quantum yields up to 84&#8201;% and lifetimes up to 4.9&#8197;ns. Additionally, TD&#8208;DFT calculations rationalize the electronic structure of the absorption characteristics of the dyes.

         <title>Ring Opening and C(&#969;)&#8208;S Coupling: Nickel&#8208;Mediated Transformation of Alicyclic Alkoxyhydroperoxides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ring&#8208;opening &#969;&#8208;dithiocarbamylation (or &#969;&#8208;xanthylation) approach based on the unusual intersection of the reactivities of organic peroxides and sulfur&#8208;containing nickel complexes is disclosed. The formation of nickel dithiocarbamate or xanthate complexes and their subsequent interaction with alkoxyhydroperoxide was found to play a key role in the formation of C&#8722;S coupling products.







Abstract
Ozonolysis of cycloalkanone semicarbazones in alcohol containing solution with the subsequent addition of nickel (II) dithiocarbamates or xanthates was found to result in &#969;&#8208;xanthyl or &#969;&#8208;dithiocarbamyl carboxylic acid esters. The reaction proceeds in several steps. The initial one is cycloalkanone semicarbazone ozonolysis in the presence of alcohol, which leads to alicyclic alkoxyhydroperoxide. The second step is an extraordinary interaction between the alkoxyhydroperoxide and nickel (II) dithiocarbamate or xanthate, which proceeds via alkoxy radical formation and its subsequent &#946;&#8208;scission, resulting in C&#8722;S coupling products. The developed method allows to obtain &#969;&#8208;xanthyl or &#969;&#8208;dithiocarbamyl esters in yields up to 52&#8201;% relative to the initial cycloalkanone semicarbazone.

         <title>Determination of the pKaH of Established Isothiourea Catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pKaH of a series of privileged (chiral) isothiourea organocatalysts in acetonitrile and DMSO was determined by using a chemical shift imaging NMR methodology.







Abstract
Isothioureas (ITUs) represent a powerful family of (chiral) Lewis base organocatalysts. Interestingly, the Br&#248;nsted basicity of these frequently used compounds has so far not systematically been investigated. Thus, we have now determined the pKaH values of the most privileged (chiral) ITUs in acetonitrile (ACN) and DMSO by using NMR. Employing Wallace's chemical shift imaging NMR method, the herein investigated ITUs were found to be weak Br&#248;nsted bases with pKaH values in the range of 16.8&#8211;17.9 in ACN and 6.3&#8211;7.8 in DMSO.

         <title>Glycosyl Esters as Stable Donors in Chemical Glycosylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycosyl ester donors represent an important class of donors in recent times to construct complex natural products and oligosaccharides. This review summarizes the past and recent methods involving anomeric esters in glycosylation reactions, including simple esters, alkenyl, alkynyl&#8208;containing esters, carbonate esters, chelation&#8208;assisted glycosyl esters, allenyl and ynenoate glycosyl esters.







Abstract
Efficient glycosylation methods are continuously being developed to obtain homogeneously pure carbohydrates to study their biological roles. The development of effective and stereoselective glycosylations using novel anomeric leaving groups constitutes an active area of research in synthetic carbohydrate chemistry. Although various glycosyl donors have been developed over the decades, anomeric esters as donors in glycosylation have received significant attention in recent times due to their convenience of preparation, shelf stability, catalytic activation, mild conditions, and high glycosylation efficiency. We focus in this review on several synthetic strategies for the assembly of the glycosyl ester&#8208;containing donors utilized in chemical glycosylation methods, including simple esters, alkenyl, alkynyl&#8208;containing esters, carbonate esters, chelation&#8208;assisted glycosyl esters, allenyl and ynenoate glycosyl esters in glycoside synthesis are summarized.

         <title>Oxygen Atom Migration of Allylic Esters via an Organocatalyzed Claisen&#8208;type Rearrangement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen atom migration of allylic esters has been reported with 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine DMAP as a catalyst. This protocol is compatible with a broad range of functional groups in gram scale. Moreover, corresponding isomerized products exhibit versatile reactivity with a series of nucleophiles to open up a platform for bioactive molecules synthesis.







Abstract
Direct transforming molecular skeleton to the other useful one is highly desirable for synthetic chemists. Oxygen atom migration of allylic esters is a powerful avenue for skeleton editing, and various methodologies involving palladium, Lewis acid and cobalt hydride catalysts have been reported. However, these protocols commonly suffer from inferior functional group tolerance and limited preparative application due to the harsh conditions and metal residues. Herein, we report a practical approach for the transformation by using an organocatalyst 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). We test this protocol generality and practicality with uniform gram&#8208;scale reactions, and it tolerates with a broad range of functional groups including boric ester, nitrile, ester and others (42 examples). Moreover, corresponding products exhibit versatile reactivity with a series of nucleophiles to open up a platform for bioactive molecules synthesis. A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed to rationalize the experimental observations.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Selective ortho&#8208;Deuteration of Aromatic Amidines with D&#8322;O</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A manganese&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;deuteration of aromatic amidines using D2O is demonstrated, achieving high regioselectivity and excellent yields. The use of Mn(CO)5Br as the catalyst and NaOAc as an additive facilitates efficient deuterium incorporation across a diverse range of substrates. The reaction is amenable to gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and the resulting products can be further transformed into deuterated heterocyclic compounds such as triazoles and imidazoles.







Abstract
We report a manganese&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;selective deuteration of aromatic amidines using D2O as the deuterium source. The reaction, catalyzed by Mn(CO)5Br in the presence of NaOAc as an additive, proceeds with high regioselectivity, achieving efficient deuterium incorporation at the ortho&#8208;position with excellent yields. The reaction scope was extended to a wide range of substituted aromatic amidines, demonstrating consistently high levels of deuterium incorporation and broad substrate compatibility. Furthermore, the method was successfully scaled up to gram&#8208;scale, and the resulting deuterated products were subsequently transformed into heterocycles, including triazoles and imidazoles.

&lt;p&gt;A manganese-catalyzed &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-deuteration of aromatic amidines using D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is demonstrated, achieving high regioselectivity and excellent yields. The use of Mn(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Br as the catalyst and NaOAc as an additive facilitates efficient deuterium incorporation across a diverse range of substrates. The reaction is amenable to gram-scale synthesis, and the resulting products can be further transformed into deuterated heterocyclic compounds such as triazoles and imidazoles.

Two facile and diversified protocols for constructing 1, 2&#8208;dihydropyridine&#8208;fused coumarins and pyridocoumarins from 4&#8208;aminocoumarins and propargylic alcohols have been developed.

Abstract
Two facile and diversified protocols for the chem&#8208;selective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridine&#8208;fused coumarins and pyridocoumarins have been developed. Readily accessible substrates, mild reaction conditions and good functional group tolerance make these procedures attractive for the construction of various dihydropyridine&#8208;fused coumarins and pyridocoumarins, which may enrich and develop the heterocyclic chemistry and medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Recent Advances in Radical Hydrofunctionalization of Alkenes and Dienes via Reductive Metal&#8208;Hydride Hydrogen Atom Transfer (MHAT)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metal&#8208;hydride hydrogen atom transfer strategy (MHAT) has emerged as a robust approach for the radical hydrofunctionalization of alkenes, demonstrating exceptional functional group tolerance and chemoselectivity. Traditional methods for generating metal&#8208;hydride (M&#8208;H) species typically require oxidative conditions that depend on stoichiometric oxidants and hydride donors, posing challenges to sustainability and scalability. In contrast, the reductive MHAT strategy, which forms M&#8208;H species through the transfer of a proton and an electron, offers a more concise and sustainable pathway for radical alkene hydrofunctionalization. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the key advances in reductive MHAT catalysis since 2019, highlighting recent innovations and discussing potential future directions for the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Zeolite Catalyzed Dehydrative N&#8208;Benzylation of Amides for the Construction of Macrolactams Under Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report continuous&#8208;flow dehydrative N&#8208;benzylation of amides using benzylic alcohols by reusable Ru&#8208;Zeolite as a heterogeneous catalyst. This method is scalable to grams and demonstrated for 30 amides and 15 macrolactams with water as the only by&#8208;product.







Abstract
Continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of acyclic amides and macrolactams has been demonstrated successfully via N&#8208;benzylation of amides using a highly reusable heterogeneous Ru&#8208;Zeolite as a catalyst, which gives only water as the byproduct. N&#8208;Benzylation of acyclic amides furnished 30&#8197;N&#8208;benzylated amides whereas intramolecular N&#8208;benzylation with alcohols was well tolerated with 15 examples of macrolactams bearing 11&#8208; to 15&#8208;membered rings. Notably, the scalability of this flow process has been demonstrated from milligrams to gram scale using the Ru&#8208;Zeolite heterogeneous catalyst. Moreover, the reusability of the catalyst is exemplified by the 16 reaction cycles carried out with one time&#8208;packed heterogeneous catalyst in the reactor bed.

We report a non&#8208;fused small molecular organic semiconductor, IMIC, with an A&#8722;D&#8208;A&#8242;&#8208;D&#8722;A molecular type. Compared to fused A&#8208;DA'D&#8722;A counterpart, IMIC features a simpler synthesis process, improved solubility, and a broader light absorption range. The non&#8208;fused strategy alleviates intramolecular stress within fused ring molecules, significantly improving n&#8208;type semiconductor property.







Abstract
N&#8208;type organic semiconductors based on non&#8208;fused rings offer concise synthesis routes and low&#8211;cost production. Leveraging intramolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions, non&#8208;fused organic semiconductors can achieve fine regulation of molecular spatial configurations, thereby influencing the electrical performance. Herein, we successfully developed a non&#8208;fused n&#8208;type organic semiconductor with an A&#8722;D&#8208;A&#8242;&#8208;D&#8722;A structure, designated as IMIC. Compared to the fused A&#8208;DA'D&#8722;A molecule, IMIC not only simplifies the synthetic steps but also significantly improves solubility and optical absorption properties. The non&#8208;fused molecular architecture relieves the internal stress of rigid, curved polycyclic fused rings, granting greater spatial freedom to the components of the IMIC molecule, which is conducive to optimizing the spatial configuration of the molecule in the aggregated state. Ultimately, the electron mobility of OFET devices based on IMIC is tripled compared to TIIC, reaching 1.1&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in ambient conditions.

Abstract
C2&#8208;symmetric 4,8&#8208;substituted bicyclo[3.3.1]nona&#8208;2,6&#8208;dienes are efficient bidentate steering ligands for the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition of arylboronic acids to N&#8208;Cbz&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4&#8208;pyridone. The arylation reactions proceed under mild conditions to provide corresponding 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;4&#8208;piperidones in high yields along with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99.8:0.2 er).

&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric 4,8-substituted bicyclo[3.3.1]nona-2,6-dienes are efficient bidentate steering ligands for the rhodium-catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition of arylboronic acids to &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Cbz-2,3-dihydro-4-pyridone. The arylation reactions proceed under mild conditions to provide corresponding 2-aryl-4-piperidones in high yields along with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99.8:0.2 er).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A&#160;Quinidine&#8208;Based Squaramide&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Cascade Double Hetero&#8208;Michael Addition&#8208;Cyclization of N&#8208;Benzylhydroxylamine: Synthesis of Chiral 1,2&#8208;Benzoxazines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The double hetero&#8208;Michael addition (DHMA), leveraging the reactivity of two distinct nucleophilic centers (oxygen and nitrogen), has emerged as a transformative strategy in organic synthesis for constructing carbon&#8208;hetero nuclear bonds in a single step. In this work, we report an innovative intermolecular DHMA cascade cyclization reaction catalyzed by a quinidine&#8208;based squaramide catalyst. The use of the squaramide catalyst is particularly noteworthy, as it enhances the electrophilicity of the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated bis&#8208;enone, thereby promoting excellent enantioselective formation of the 1,2&#8208;benzoxazine. The process demonstrates excellent enantiomeric excess (up to 99% ee), moderate diastereoselectivity (up to 6:1 dr), and high yields. The four different 1,2&#8208;benzoxazine stereoisomers have been synthesized with excellent enantiomeric excess. Furthermore, the scaleup reaction of the methodology has been extended with excellent outcomes.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy has been developed for the controllable coupling of carboxylic acid esters with deprotonated halogenated diboromethane. A array of &#945;&#8208;halogenated ketones and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dihaloketones were synthesized through using different halogenated diboromethane and electrophiles.







Abstract
Halogenated gem&#8208;diboron reagents, as structurally unique gem&#8208;diborylalkanes, are crucial in organic synthesis chemistry. Herein, we report a strategy with controlled synthesis of &#945;&#8208;mono&#8208; and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;di&#8208;halogenated ketones through nucleophilic addition reaction of halogenated diboromethanes with carboxylic acid esters. The substrate scope is broad and the nucleophilic addition reaction proceeds from a diverse range of carboxylic acid esters with bromo&#8208; or chloro&#8208;diborylmethanes. Moreover, an intriguing heterocyclic compound has been serendipitously synthesized as well.

         <title>O&#8722;Doped Carbon Nitride: A Recyclable, Metal&#8208;free Photocatalyst for Oxidative Amidation of Aromatic Aldehydes and Amines under Visible Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nitride material was reported as an efficient solid photocatalyst for the synthesis of amide via the reaction of aromatic aldehydes with amines under visible light irradiation in the absence of metal, oxidant, or additives, and excellent functional group tolerance and good yields were observed. Additionally, this catalyst can also effectively activate the &#945;&#8208;position C&#8722;H bond of tetrahydrofuran and cumene.







Abstract
Oxidative amidation of aldehydes with amines is a promising strategy for the synthesis of valuable amides. However, conventional methods often use toxic oxidants and additives, resulting in the generation of chemical waste. In this study, we report the catalytic oxidative amidation of aldehydes with amines using molecular oxygen under additive &amp; metal&#8208;free conditions in visible light, facilitated by an oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nitride (OCN) catalyst. The OCN catalyst shows excellent activity in the production of various amides, demonstrating high functional group tolerance. Furthermore, the OCN catalyst can be reused several times without loss of activity.

         <title>Photoinduced, Decarboxylative Coupling of &#945;&#8208;Keto Acids with Diselenides to Form Selenoesters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and eco&#8208;friendly method for the synthesis of selenoester derivatives through photoinduced decarboxylative coupling of &#945;&#8208;keto acids with diselenides under metal and sensitizer&#8208;free conditions is reported.







Abstract
A mild and green strategy for the synthesis of selenoester derivatives has been developed through photoinduced decarboxylative coupling of &#945;&#8208;keto acids with diselenides. This transformation proceeds smoothly without requiring any external photocatalyst, additive, or oxidant. Both diaryl and dialkyl diselenides react efficiently with &#945;&#8208;keto acids to produce selenoesters in good yields. Mechanistic studies suggest that the generated acyl radical is responsible for this transformation.

         <title>NaI&#8208;Promoted Synthesis of Dihydroquinolines via an Unusual Azetine Intermediate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NaI&#8208;promoted Skraup&#8208;type reaction of anilines with ketones via an unprecedented azetine intermediate has been developed, which was successfully applied to a hundred&#8208;gram&#8208;scale synthesis of 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines in good isolated yields.







Abstract
New approaches to improve Skraup&#8208;type reactions for large&#8208;scale synthesis of 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines (1,2&#8208;DHQs) are highly desirable yet challenging in synthetic chemistry. Herein, an efficient sodium iodide&#8208;promoted Skraup&#8208;type reaction of anilines with ketones has been developed at low loading of HBF4 (0.5 mol%), thus providing a sustainable and economical strategy for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;DHQs. A variety of 1,2&#8208;DHQs were obtained in moderate to good isolated yields. The practicality of this strategy was well demonstrated by a hundred&#8208;gram&#8208;scale synthesis of 6&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2,2,4&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydroquinoline in 68% isolated yield. Intriguingly, an unusual azetine intermediate was successfully isolated and structurally determined by NMR and MS, indicating of an unprecedented mechanism for Skraup&#8208;type quinoline synthesis.

         <title>Quinoid Carbene Mediated C(sp2)&#8208;Heteroatom Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C(sp2)&#8208;heteroatom bonds play a critical role in bioactive molecules, drugs, and materials. Diazo quinones, with unique reactivity, offer a promising route for forming these bonds. This review outlines recent progress using quinoid carbenes from diazo quinones to build C(sp2)&#8722;N, C(sp2)&#8722;O, and C(sp2)&#8722;S bonds via various catalytic transformations, providing milder alternatives for diverse compound synthesis.







Abstract
C(sp2)&#8208;heteroatom bonds play a critical role in biologically active molecules, pharmaceuticals, and functional materials. Traditional methods for synthesizing these bonds often rely on transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, such as the Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig and Ullmann reactions, which have limitations, including the requirement for elevated temperature and basic conditions. In recent years, diazo quinones have emerged as promising reagents for C(sp2)&#8208;heteroatom bond formation due to their unique structural and reactive properties, which include high electrophilicity and a tendency toward aromatization. This review highlights recent advances in the use of quinoid carbenes, derived from diazo quinones, for the construction of C(sp2)&#8722;N, C(sp2)&#8722;O, and C(sp2)&#8722;S bonds. Key methodologies discussed include rhodium&#8208;, iridium&#8208;, ruthenium&#8208; and palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, heteroatom&#8208;H bond insertion reactions, migration reactions and sigmatropic rearrangements. These methods offer mild, functional group&#8208;tolerant alternatives to traditional approaches, showcasing their utility in the synthesis of complex bioactive molecules, medicinally relevant compounds, and materials.

         <title>Selective synthesis of cyclic dithiocarbonates using bis&#8208;benzimidazolate salts as multifunctional catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic dithiocarbonates (1,3&#8208;oxathiolane&#8208;2&#8208;thione) were efficiently synthesized from epoxides and CS2 using disodium bis&#8208;benzimidazolate salts as catalysts. Three different catalysts (BBE&#8722;Me, BBE&#8722;H, BBE&#8208;NO2) were designed and synthesized, with BBE&#8722;Me showing 95&#8201;% conversion and 99&#8201;% selectivity. The catalyst enabled selective, solvent&#8208;free reactions under mild conditions. Mechanistic insights revealed simultaneous activation of CS2 and epoxides, acting as a multifunctional organocatalyst.







Abstract
Cyclic dithiocarbonates of the type 1,3&#8208;oxathiolane&#8208;2&#8208;thione were selectively and efficiently produced from the reaction between epoxides and CS2 using disodium bis&#8208;benzimidazolate salts as catalysts. We have designed and synthesized this group of three nucleophilic catalysts from the neutral forms of bis&#8208;benzimidazole compounds (BBE&#8208;Me, BBE&#8208;H and BBE&#8208;NO2), through simple and efficient procedures. All three catalysts, with aryl substituents possessing different electronic characteristics, were able to selectively catalyze the production of cyclic dithiocarbonates. BBE&#8208;Me proved to be the most effective catalyst in the initial screening with 1,2&#8208;epoxy&#8208;3&#8208;phenoxypropane, converting 95&#8201;% of the epoxide with 99&#8201;% of selectivity for the cyclic dithiocarbonate 1,3&#8208;oxathiolane&#8208;2&#8208;thione. This catalyst was subsequently used to evaluate various reaction parameters and then several epoxides were selectively converted to the respective cyclic dithiocarbonates, under mild conditions, with a low catalyst loading, short reaction times, and in a solvent&#8208; and additive&#8208;free system. A mechanistic proposal, supported by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, demonstrated for the first time that a nucleophilic catalyst in this system can simultaneously activate both CS2 and the epoxide molecule.

         <title>Synthesis of Enantioenriched 2&#8208;((Hetera)Cyclo) Alkylchromanols and their Spirocyclic Analogs through Enzymatic Resolution</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic Resolution An expedient approach to the multigram preparation of enantioenriched 2&#8208;((hetera)cyclo) alkylchromanols and their spirocyclic analogs based on their enzymatic acylation or enzymatic hydrolysis of the corresponding acetates is described. Utility of the obtained intermediates for the preparation of chiral sp3&#8208;enriched building blocks valuable to drug discovery is demonstrated.







Abstract
An efficient approach to the multigram synthesis of 2&#8208;((hetera) cyclo) alkylchromanols and their spirocyclic analogs based on enzymatic resolution is described. It is shown that enzymatic acylation could be used for the preparation of enantioenriched title compounds with primary alkyl substituents at the C&#8208;2 position. Meanwhile, enzymatic hydrolysis of the corresponding acetates was optimal for the preparation of the target alcohols when significant steric hindrance is present, e.&#8201;g., due to the &#945;&#8208;branching. The latter factor was demonstrated to be crucial for the enzymatic reaction rate in both cases. The synthetic utility of the obtained chiral alcohols was demonstrated through Mitsunobu configuration inversion, as well as by preparation of the corresponding primary amines &#8211; valuable sp3&#8208;enriched building blocks for medicinal chemistry.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The power of chiral silver catalysts as special mild Lewis acids has been applied to develop enantioselective 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions, complex domino/tandem reactions, and miscellaneous cyclizations, allowing novel chiral heterocyclic products to be achieved in high enantioselectivities. This review updates the field of enantioselective silver&#8208;catalyzed transformations applied to the synthesis of chiral heterocycles, covering the literature since 2018.







Abstract
This review collects the recent developments in the synthesis of chiral heterocycles through enantioselective silver&#8208;catalyzed transformations published since 2018. It demonstrates the power of chiral silver catalysts as special mild Lewis acids to provide an impressive diversity of reaction pathways, such as 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions, various types of cyclizations, along with a wide variety of more complex domino/tandem reactions, allowing many types of novel chiral heterocyclic products to be achieved in high enantioselectivities.

         <title>Exploring Self&#8208;Assembly and Viscoelastic Behavior of Pyrene&#8208;Based Fluorescent Hydrogel: Designing Paper Sensors for Water&#8208;Soluble Explosives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently organic&#8208;doped polyethyleneimine based hydrogels have emerged as smart responsive materials for optical sensing applications. To this end, herein we have designed and synthesized a biocompatible fluorescent hydrogel based on polyethyleneimine (PEI), incorporating pyrene as the polyaromatic signaling moiety. The self&#8208;assembly properties of the composite materials were primarily influenced by the nature of the organic dopant, the degree of substitution, and the microenvironment. The presence of the polyaromatic scaffold, such as pyrene, not only affects the fluorescence properties of the molecules but also modulates the extent of cross&#8208;linking by controlling &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. The hydrogel formation was observed in a methanol&#8208;water (3% v/v) mixture. Additionally, the pyrene&#8208;attached hydrogel demonstrated promising potential for the highly sensitive detection of trinitrophenol (TNP), a toxic, water&#8208;soluble explosive. Spectroscopic investigations revealed that the electrostatic interaction between the ammonium units of PYR&#8208;PEI and picrate anions in aqueous medium facilitated charge transfer from pyrene to the picrate anion, resulting in a fluorescence turn&#8208;off response. Along with fluorometric response, using rheological experiments we show that the viscoelastic behaviour of the polymer gels also varied significantly upon addition of TNP.</dc:description>

Here, a green synergistic combination of I2, Cs2CO3, and H2O systematically utilised to produce varied flavones and flavanones in a one&#8208;pot manner that includes numerous bioactive compounds along with the natural products naringenin and apigenin.







Abstract
Flavonoids are an important class of naturally existing scaffolds known for their diverse biological activities and have been immensely synthesized using stoichiometric reagent amounts. Herein, we report a reliable, robust, one&#8208;pot, transition metal and additive&#8208;free protocol for the synthesis of flavones and flavanones from 2&#8208;hydroxyacetophenone and substituted aldehydes. Our developed method utilizes Cs2CO3 as a base and iodine as an oxidant in H2O: DMSO (9&#8201;:&#8201;1) solvent system, which provides direct access to many flavones and flavanones in excellent yields under milder reaction conditions with simple yet easily available substrates. In application, naturally occurring compounds such as naringenin and apigenin have been successfully synthesized using developed protocol.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Direct Synthesis of Secondary Amides and Nitriles Using O&#8208;(2&#8208;Pyrimidinyl)&#8208;N&#8208;Boc Hydroxylamine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explored the first application of the novel O&#8208;(2&#8208;pyrimidinyl)&#8208;N&#8208;Boc hydroxylamine reagent for the direct synthesis of secondary amides and nitriles from ketones and aldehydes via the Beckmann rearrangement. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) indicates that this reagent is more stable than similar alternatives. This protocol offers notable advantages: it is operationally simple, mild, metal&#8208;free, conducted in open air, scalable, operates at ambient temperature, high yields, and demonstrates good functional group tolerance.







Abstract
A novel hydroxylamine&#8208;derived aminating agent, O&#8208;(2&#8208;pyrimidinyl)&#8208;N&#8208;Boc hydroxylamine (PymONHBoc), has been designed and synthesized, from readily available 2&#8208;chloropyrimidine. This reagent demonstrates superior shelf stability and ease of handling compared to other hydroxylamine&#8208;derived reagents. Here, we present a metal&#8208;free method for the direct conversion of ketones and aldehydes into sec&#8208;amides and nitriles using PymONHBoc as the aminating agent. This method efficiently converts a wide range of aliphatic and aromatic carbonyl compounds into the corresponding amides and nitriles with good to excellent yields under ambient conditions. The use of PymONHBoc is advantageous, as it facilitates the in&#8197;situ generation of the activated oxime intermediate, concomitantly producing a non&#8208;interfering byproduct.

         <title>Greening the Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Dihydrobenzofuran Selenides: I2/TBHP&#8208;Promoted Selenocyclization of 2&#8208;Allylphenols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative and green method to produce 2&#8208;[(organoselanyl)methyl]&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans promoted by the I2/TBHP oxidant system was developed. The reactions occur in only one minute in the presence of different 2&#8208;allylphenols and diorganyl diselenides at room temperature using 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% I2 and 0.30&#8197;mmol of TBHP in the absence of solvent to obtain fifteen compounds in yields up to 93&#8201;%.







Abstract
In this work we describe the synthesis of selenium&#8208;containing dihydrobenzofurans through the selenocyclization reaction of 2&#8208;allylphenols. The reaction procedure uses only an I2/TBHP oxidant system at room temperature, enabling an efficient synthesis of 2&#8208;[(organoselanyl)methyl]&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans. The products are formed immediately after the addition of the oxidant system in a mixture of 2&#8208;allylphenol and diorganyl diselenide, in the absence of solvent, at mild experimental conditions. Furthermore, control experiments were carried out, including 77Se NMR analyses to identify intermediates, which contributed to the elucidation of the reaction mechanism.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanism of a copper&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and anti&#8208;selective 1,2&#8208;silylboration of internal alkynes was theoretically studied to understand the reaction pathway and the origin of selectivity. The proposed overall reaction pathway involves the syn&#8208;to&#8208;anti isomerization via an anionic allenic transition state stabilized by the conjugation with the benzene ring. The anti&#8208;selectivity is determined at the borylation step and controlled by the steric effect of the silyl group introduced on the alkyne carbon. The computational results obtained in this study are highly informative for the development of new catalytic transformations involving syn/anti&#8208;isomerization processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Directed Regioselective Cascade Reaction with Diazo Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green, efficient and highly regioselective synthesis of pyrazoles and their derivatives from the combination of two different diazo compounds to afford N&#8208;substituted using CF3CH2OTf as reaction medium was developed, without any catalysts.







Abstract
A tandem system comprising cyclization reaction of diazo compound and cross&#8208;coupling of the other one has been developed. This provides facile access to pyrazoles and there derivatives with high levels of regioselectivity in moderate to good yields. This process uniquely utilizes CF3CH2OTf both as a solvent and a catalyst under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies provide insights into the intricate sequence involved in the formation of pyrazoles and further selective cross&#8208;coupling with another diazo compound.

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Linalool&#8208;Derived Compounds via Catalytic Epoxidation and Ring Opening</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study focuses on the selective epoxidation of linalool to produce linalool epoxide, a valuable intermediate for the synthesis of novel linalool&#8208;derived compounds. A robust and non&#8208;noble cobalt catalyst was employed to achieve high yields of linalool epoxide under mild reaction conditions. The catalytic system displayed remarkable efficiency and reusability, providing a platform for exploring different feedstock, including rosewood oil, to demonstrate its versatility in raw feedstock valorization. Further functionalization of linalool&#8208;derived molecules was achieved through regioselective ring&#8208;opening reactions, yielding novel ethers with potential applications in the fine chemical industry. In summary, this study presents a comprehensive approach to the sustainable synthesis of linalool&#8208;derived compounds, displaying the versatility of the catalytic system and providing a basis for the development of novel fine organic compounds with potential industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling Phenanthrenoid Dimerization in Juncus acutus: A DFT&#8208;guided Exploration of Radical&#8208;Coupling Reaction Mechanisms</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Juncus acutus&#160;is a plant found near ponds and brackish marshes, producing secondary metabolites like phenanthrenoid dimers with antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti&#8208;inflammatory activities. Despite this, little is known about the detailed mechanisms behind their dimerization reactions. In this study, we used Density Functional Theory to explore the reaction mechanisms of phenanthrene and dihydrophenanthrene species in radical coupling, both in gas&#8208;phase and solution. The dimerization reactions, initiated by the OH radical, result in the formation of two phenanthrenoid dimers (homodimer and heterodimer). The OH radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from the hydroxyl group, leading to the formation of radicals and water. Our analysis of electronic spin density highlighted the preferred reactive sites that drive regioselective dimer formation. Furthermore, the study identifies a triplet &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#160;stacked intermediate preceding the diketone formation on the singlet potential energy surface, revealing a two&#8208;state reactivity mechanism. The diketone dimers are then converted via a water&#8208;mediated keto&#8208;enol tautomerization into their dienolic forms, completing the reaction pathway. This work offers insights into the complex dimerization processes of phenanthrenoids in nature, using computational methods to shed light on poorly understood molecular mechanisms in plant organisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Multigram Synthesis of 3&#8208;Azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane Derivatives Including Bicyclic Thalidomide Analogs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient approach to the multigram synthesis of 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes is described. The method relied on the intramolecular imide formation in the properly 1,3&#8208;functionalized cyclobutane derivative. In turn, the latter compound was obtained via the diastereoselective Strecker reaction of readily accessible 3&#8208;oxo&#173;cyclobutanecarboxylate. The resulting synthetic intermediate &#8211; 1&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione &#8211; was used to synthe&#173;size several monoprotected bicyclic diamines valuable as building blocks for medicinal chemistry, as well as a series of bridged analogs of Thalidomide, a known anticancer drug and a component of proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs).</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A samarium diiodide/samarium&#8208;mediated direct deoxygenative hydroborylation of aldehydes with hydroborate ester has been reported. In this method, unactivated aldehydes and hydroborate ester have been employed as starting materials for the synthesis of primary alkyl borate esters. Broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance has been demonstrated that this is a robust method for deoxygenative hydroborylation of aldehydes.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Direct N&#8211;C(sp2) Nitrone Synthesis from Oxime</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrones are pivotal in organic chemistry, especially for the synthesis of natural and biologically active compounds via 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions and Kinugasa reactions. Although numerous methods have been reported for the synthesis of nitrones with an sp3 carbon connected to a nitrogen atom, the development of nitrones with an sp2 carbon linkage, including N&#8208;vinyl, N&#8208;aryl, and N&#8208;alkoxycarbonyl nitrones, remains relatively underexplored. This review summarizes the current research trends and methodologies for the direct synthesis of nitrones, in which an sp2 carbon is directly bonded to a nitrogen atom, beginning with oximes.</dc:description>
