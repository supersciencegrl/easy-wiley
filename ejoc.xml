         <title>Selective Synthesis of 5&#8208;Alkylated and 5&#8208;Alkenylated Chromones via Catalytic C&#8208;H Coupling of Chromones with Allyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe two types of C5 functionalization reactions of chromones with allyl alcohols. Diverse 5&#8208;substituted chromones can be produced by modulating the catalysts in these reactions: Rh(III) results in the formation of 5&#8208;alkylated chromones, and Ru(II) furnishes 5&#8208;alkenylated products. We also achieve further functionalizations of these 5&#8208;substituted chromones, which demonstrates the superiority of this method. Notable features of these new methods include readily available precursors, tunable reactivity, exclusive C5&#8208;selectivity, and easy derivatization of products.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrosynthesis of stable betulin&#8208;derived nitrile oxides and their application in synthesis of cytostatic lupane&#8208;type triterpenoid&#8208;isoxazole conjugates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel lupane&#8208;type triterpenoid&#8208;isoxazole conjugates were designed by direct placing of isoxazole linker at C(17) of triterpenoid. The suggested synthetic sequence demonstrates successful combination of electro&#8208;organic synthesis and conventional approaches. TEMPO&#8208;mediated electrooxidation of betulin to betulinal was developed and optimized at boron&#8208;doped diamond anodes with potassium acetate as inexpensive supporting electrolyte. Betulinal&#8208;derived oxime was further selectively electro&#8208;oxidized at a graphite anode to nitrile oxide, which proved to be stable and isolable species. The same reaction sequence was performed with 3&#946;&#8208;lupane&#8208;3,28&#8208;diol. Nitrile oxides were characterized by 15 N NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The isolable nitrile oxides allowed creation of isoxazole library by 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions with various alkynes. Some of the title conjugates exhibit cytostatic properties against breast cancer cell line MCF7, glioblastoma multiform cell line U&#8208;87 MG and lung carcinoma cell line A549 with growth inhibition (GI 50 ) concentrations up to 11 &#956; m , while being harmless to immortalized human fibroblasts hTERT (GI 50 &gt; 100 &#181;m ).</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and spectrophotometric studies of 9&#8208;substituted&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethoxyacridine multifunctionalizable fluorescent dyes and their macrocyclic derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acridine derivatives are widely used as antiseptics, disinfectants, antibiotics and fluorescent dyes as well as a subunit of optical sensor molecules of various analytical applications. We reported here the synthesis of several new 9&#8208;substituted&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethoxyacridine derivatives (9&#8208;bromo&#8208;, 9&#8208;(p&#8208;methylphenyl)&#8208;, 9&#8208;(p&#8208;benzyloxyphenyl)&#8208;, 9&#8208;azido&#8208;, 9&#8208;phenyltriazole&#8208;, 9&#8208;[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl]&#8208;, 9&#8208;nitrile&#8208;) as potential multifunctionalizable fluorescent precursors of sensor molecules, indicators or dyes including optimized procedures for preparation of 9&#8208;haloacridines and their cross&#8208;coupling reactions. An improved stability of several new compounds could be achieved by the synthetic modification at position  9  of the acridine unit compared to their unsubstituted acridine analogues. The basic spectroscopic characteristics of these useful intermediates were also determined. The new fluorescent compounds showed promising photochemical properties for optochemical&#8208;based applications in the future. The extremely large  Stokes&#8208;shifts (above 15500 cm  &#8208;1) should especially be emphasized. Moreover, the effects of the substituents at position  9  of the acridine unit on fluorescence signaling were studied by the examples of new precursors and their macrocyclic derivatives as known optical sensor molecules. Some interesting relationships between quantum yield and structural features were reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Studies of Norditerpenoid Alkaloids: Conformation Analysis in Crystal and in Solution States</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The A/E&#8208;[3.3.1]azabicyclic rings of norditerpenoid alkaloids adopt twisted&#8208;chair/twisted&#8208;chair conformations, causing the 1H NMR spectroscopic effect of steric compression of 2&#8208;Ha where the N&#8208;atom lone&#8208;pair electrons of these norditerpenoid alkaloids partly overlap with 2&#8208;Ha. This effect is shown to be more significant in synthetic [3.3.1]azabicycles where the analogues adopt true&#8208;chair/true&#8208;chair conformations.







Abstract
Conformational analyses are presented of several pharmacologically important norditerpenoid alkaloids (NDAs), in crystal and in solution states. Crystal data of 8 NDAs (4 free bases and 4 salts) were obtained, in which crassicauline A, aconitine HCl, and methyllycaconitine HClO4 are reported for the first time. 1D/2D NMR spectroscopies of 7 NDAs (5 free bases and 2&#8197;salts) were recorded comprehensively. Crystal conformations of NDAs are described with a revised cyclohexane ring nomenclature. The A/E&#8208;rings of NDA&#8208;free bases exist in twisted&#8208;chair/twisted&#8208;chair conformations, leading to examples of the 1H NMR effect of steric compression shown in the A&#8208;ring. The A/E&#8208;rings of NDA salts adopt boat/chair crystal conformations, as does the protonated synthetic [3.3.1]azabicycle in its crystal lattice. However, in aqueous solutions at physiological pH, this protonated analogue adopts a true chair/true chair conformation where the NDA salts retain their twisted boat/twisted chair conformations.

         <title>Fluorophore multimerization as an efficient approach towards bright protein labels</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell analysis techniques like flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy are widely used to explore cells in real&#8208;time and provide important insights into a variety of cellular processes. These techniques require bright and specific staining reagents to generate strong fluorescence signal and enable reliable read&#8208;out, making the choice of fluorescent labels a key aspect of experimental design. Much research has been done in the field of fluorophore development to generate bright small&#8208;molecule dyes, fluorescent proteins, and emitting nanoparticles. However, it remains challenging to modify biomolecules with multiple emitters and avoid self&#8208;quenching of such fluorophores at the same time. Herein, we present advances in multimerization&#8208;based methods for the generation of fluorescent labels with high brightness and discuss their advantages and limitations in the context of flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A series of axially linked pyrene&#8208;naphthalimide fluorophores (  N2Py  ,  N4Py  , and  BNPy  ) bearing a different number of 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide units substituted on pyrene and bis&#8208;pyrene cores were designed and synthesized using palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions in a stepwise synthetic manner. These molecules were chemically characterized, and their photoelectric properties were explored by spectroscopy, electrochemical and theoretical studies. They exhibited push&#8208;pull characteristics with intense fluorescence in solutions, strong solvatochromic behaviors, good thermal and electrochemical stabilities.  N2Py  ,  N4Py  , and  BNPy  were successfully applied as emitters in solution&#8208;processed OLED devices, which resulted in blue&#8208;green emissions with promising device performance. Particularly, the  BNPy  &#8208;based device achieved the best EL results with a maximum brightness of 3389 cd m  &#8208;2  , a maximum EQE of 3.98%, a maximum LE of 3.22 cd A  &#8208;1  , and a low turn&#8208;on voltage of 3.2 V.</dc:description>

         <title>PHANE&#8208;TetraPHOS, The first D2 Symmetric Chiral Tetraphosphane.&#160;Synthesis, Metal Complexation and Application in Homogeneous Stereoselective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PHANE&#8208;TetraPHOS, a new  D  2  symmetric tetraphosphane based on the [2.2]&#8208;paracyclophane scaffold, has been synthesized and characterized. The peculiarity of this system is the presence of four homotopic diphenylphosphane groups, exchangeable through  C  2  symmetry operations and consequently indistinguishable. Their spatial arrangement allows the simultaneous complexation of two metal atoms. Enantiomeric purity was attained at tetra&#8208;phosphane oxide level by fractional crystallization of the diastereomeric adducts obtained from the racemate with enantiopure dibenzoyltartaric acids. Alkaline treatment of diastereomerically pure adducts followed by exhaustive P&#8208;O groups reduction with HSiCl  3  gave both PHANE&#8208;TetraPHOS antipodes in an enantiopure state. They were tested as rhodium ligands in the homogeneous enantioselective hydrogenation of some benchmark unsaturated compounds. Catalytic activity and enantiodiscrimination ability were found comparable to those exhibited by the complexes of the parent bidentate ligand PHANEPHOS, but only half a mole of precious chiral ligand was employed.</dc:description>

         <title>Room Temperature Phosphorescence from Organic Materials: Unravelling the Emissive Behaviour of Chloro&#8208;Substituted Derivatives of Cyclic Triimidazole</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 13, Page 2041-2049, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mild chlorination of cyclic triimidazole with N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide affords the new mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;chloro&#8208;derivatives characterized by aggregation&#8208;induced emission comprising dual fluorescence and multiple phosphorescences. The origin of the emissive behavior of these compounds is analyzed by means of DFT/TDDFT calculations, crystal structure analysis, and comparison with previously reported members of this family.







Abstract
Purely organic luminophores that exhibit room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are receiving an ever&#8208;growing attention. The design of efficient RTP materials and the understanding of their emissive behaviour, however, remain a challenging task. Herein, to gain further insights into metal&#8208;free RTP, we report the synthesis, characterization, and photophysical study of chloro&#8208;derivatives of [1,2&#8208;a:1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;c:1&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;e][1,3,5]triazine or cyclic triimidazole (TT). Mono&#8208; (1Cl), di&#8208; (2Cl) and tri&#8208;chloro&#8208;TT (3Cl) derivatives are prepared by mild chlorination with N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide (NCS). The three compounds are characterized by aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) comprising dual fluorescence and multiple phosphorescences, whose origin is disclosed by crystal structure analysis together with accurate DFT/TDDFT calculations. Comparison with previously reported bromine and iodine TT derivatives reveals the new chlorinated compounds as the best performing halogenated AIE members of the family.

         <title>Synthesis of Azolium&#8208;2&#8208;dithiocarboxylate Zwitterions under Mild, Aerobic Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 13, Page 2025-2033, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twelve symmetrical or unsymmetrical azolium&#8208;2&#8208;dithiocarboxylate zwitterions with aliphatic or aromatic substituents on their nitrogen atoms were obtained in high yields upon reaction of azolium salts with CS2 and Cs2CO3 in acetonitrile at room temperature. Compared to the previous strategies devised for the synthesis of NHC&#8901;CS2 betaines, this novel procedure relied on an innocuous, weak base and could be applied under mild aerobic conditions.







Abstract
Twelve imidazolium&#8208;, imidazolinium&#8208;, or benzimidazolium&#8208;2&#8208;dithiocarboxylate zwitterions with aliphatic or aromatic substituents on their nitrogen atoms, including four new unsymmetrical 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;3&#8208;arylimidazolium derivatives, were obtained in high yields (62&#8211;96&#8201;%) upon reaction of azolium salts with CS2 and Cs2CO3 in acetonitrile at room temperature. Compared to the previous strategies devised for the synthesis of NHC&#8901;CS2 betaines, this novel procedure relied on an innocuous, weak base and could be applied under mild aerobic conditions. All the new compounds were fully characterized by various analytical techniques and the molecular structures of two of them were determined by XRD analysis. An associative mechanism involving the concerted reaction of the azolium salts with both CS2 and CO32&#8722; was tentatively proposed to account for the formation of the zwitterionic adducts without the intervention of free carbenes. This would explain the good results obtained with a weak inorganic base that lacks the strength needed to deprotonate the azolium salt substrates.

         <title>The pseudotransannular ring opening of 1&#8208;aminocyclohept&#8208;4&#8208;ene&#8208;derived epoxides in the synthesis of tropane alkaloids. Total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Ferrugine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have optimized a synthetic approach to (&#177;)&#8208;Ferrugine in 8 steps starting from 5&#8208;aminocyclohept&#8208;1&#8208;ene and using the Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed pseudotransannular ring opening of the epoxide derived from this cycloheptene as the key step for the construction of the 8&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane central core. While attempting the enantioselective synthesis of this natural product from enantiopure 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;8&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane we have found that this compound shows a pronounced tendency to racemize  via  an achiral symmetric aziridinium intermediate. This racemization side process has been studied in detail using both experimental and computational methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Free One&#8208;Pot Sonogashira&#8208;Type Coupling for the Efficient Preparation of Symmetric Diarylalkyne Ligands for Metal&#8208;Organic Cages**
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;free one&#8208;pot Sonogashira&#8208;type synthesis is reported that enables the synthesis of bipyridine&#8208; and benzimidazole&#8208;based ligands for metal&#8208;organic cages in high isolated yields and short reaction times.







Abstract
The often time&#8208;consuming and challenging multi&#8208;step synthesis of ligands for metal&#8208;organic cages is a limiting factor for the discovery and application of new cages. We report a highly efficient copper&#8208;free one&#8208;pot Sonogashira&#8208;type coupling for the preparation of symmetric diarylalkyne ligands on both a small and large scale; bipyridine&#8208; and benzimidazole&#8208;based ligands for the self&#8208;assembly of Co4L6 cages were synthesized in short reaction times and high isolated yields directly from aryl halide precursors. This one&#8208;pot method reduces the synthetic burden of ligand synthesis and will facilitate the preparation of ligands with additional functionality for applications of their corresponding cages.

         <title>Structural Studies of Norditerpenoid Alkaloids: Conformation Analysis in Crystal and in Solution States</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows the simplified X&#8208;ray structures of four biologically important norditerpenoid alkaloids. On the left are the well&#8208;known poison, aconitine and the clinically used lappaconitine. These two are natural products isolated from Aconite plants (in the background). The right&#8208;hand flowers are Delphiniums, from which methyllycaconitine and lycoctonine are obtained. Methyllycaconitine, one of the most potent and selective nAChR antagonists, does not show any of the biological activity of aconitine. Lycoctonine has lost the biological activity by losing the key aromatic side&#8208;chain. More information can be found in the Full Paper by I.&#8197;S. Blagbrough et&#8197;al.

         <title>Front Cover: Synthesis, Structures, and Electrochemical Properties of Bis&#8208; and Tetrakis(diphenylphosphino)tetrathiafulvalenes Extended with an Anthraquinoid Spacer (13/2021)</title>

         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows the unique reduction process of bis&#8208; and tetrakis(diphenylphosphino)tetrathiafulvalenes. The simultaneous two&#8208;electron transfer processes of them are irreversible. That is, the extra cathodic wave, which might be attributed to the reduction process from dication (T form) to neutral state (S form) via the unstable neutral biradical (T form), was observed at a significantly negative potential. The conformational change between T&#8208; and S&#8208; form is just like a flying crane. It was the first time that such unique reduction process of TTFAQ derivatives without TTF moieties was observed. More information can be found in the Communication by Y. Misaki et&#8197;al.

         <title>The Winding Road towards an Atropo&#8208;enantioselective &#8216;ARYNE Coupling&#8217;</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 13, Page 1971-1978, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective addition of aryllithiums onto arynes, leading to axially chiral biaryls in the absence of transition metals, was investigated by means of chiral ligands of lithium. Biaryls with a high degree of steric congestion around the aryl&#8211;aryl bond could be obtained.







Abstract
For the first time, the challenging atropo&#8208;enantioselective coupling of in&#8208;situ generated arynes and aryllithiums in the presence of a chiral ligand of lithium was investigated. This preliminary study demonstrates the feasibility of this concept, by affording enantioenriched axially chiral biaryls even in the case of products showing a high degree of steric congestion around the newly created aryl&#8722;aryl bond.

         <title>Synthesis, Structures, and Electrochemical Properties of Bis&#8208; and Tetrakis(diphenylphosphino)tetrathiafulvalenes Extended with an Anthraquinoid Spacer</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 13, Page 1960-1963, April 8, 2021. </description>

Tetrathiafulvalenes extended with an anthraquinoid spacer (TTFAQ) functionalized diphenylphosphino groups were successfully synthesized. X&#8208;ray structure analysis revealed that the phosphorus atoms adopt the typical distorted tetrahedral geometry. The cyclic voltammetry suggested the coexistence of two different reduction processes depending on the scan rate. It is the first observation in TTFAQs without TTF moieties.







Abstract
Bis&#8208; and tetrakis(diphenylphosphino)tetrathiafulvalenes extended with an anthraquinoid spacer were successfully synthesized. X&#8208;ray structure analysis revealed that the phosphorus atoms adopt the typical distorted tetrahedral geometry. Their average C&#8722;P&#8722;C angles and phosphorus&#8722;carbon distances resemble those of diphenylphosphino&#8208;substituted TTF derivatives. The cyclic voltammograms consisted of one pair of irreversible, simultaneous two&#8208;electron transfer waves. A combination of cyclic voltammetry experiments and DFT calculations suggested the coexistence of two different reduction processes depending on the scan rate.

         <title>Butterfly Mesogens Based on Carbazole, Fluorene or Fluorenone: Mesomorphous, Gelling, Photophysical, and Photoconductive Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 13, Page 1989-2002, April 8, 2021. </description>

A generic synthetic method based on the Suzuki&#8208;Scholl reactions was successfully exploited to yield new poly(hetero)aromatic hydrocarbons containing carbazole, fluorene or fluorenone moieties. These butterfly&#8208;like mesogens exhibit columnar mesophases, form fibrous gels in various solvents, emit blue to orange light in films and solutions and show outstanding photocurrent behavior with charge carrier mobility in the &#8764;0.03&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 range.







Abstract
We report a straightforward and generic synthesis of several new series of annulated &#960;&#8208;extended poly&#8208;(hetero)aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), with carbazole, fluorene and fluorenone central building blocks by the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura/Scholl tandem reactions. The corresponding series of ditriphenylene discogens with a carbazole or a fluorenone central core, respectively, possess hexagonal columnar mesophases with broad mesophase ranges and high clearing points, as well as demonstrate a strong aggregation tendency in organic solvents as supergelators. The laterally&#8208;substituted ditriphenylene mesogens based on dimethyl&#8208;fluorene core exhibit a rich polymorphism with rectangular and hexagonal columnar mesophases from low temperatures onward, whereas their dioctyl&#8208;fluorene homologues melt directly into the isotropic liquid without showing mesophases. These latter family of compounds are luminescent with very high fluorescent quantum yields, of around 70&#8201;% in solution, and show outstanding photocurrent behavior with charge carrier mobility in the 10&#8722;2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 range, as measured by photocurrent transient time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (TOF) technique. This straightforward molecular design and simple synthetic strategy proved to be both potent and resilient, and could be generally applied to the fabrication of a great variety of other heteroarene molecular systems as organic semiconductors and electroluminescent materials for potentially low&#8208;cost applications.

The Cover Feature shows a historical photography of a large&#8208;scale explosive test as well as the expanding blast wave, which was taken by D. R. Richmond (US Army). The photography is complemented by pictures of the synthetic pathway, the crystal structure and the calculated Hirshfeld surface of 3,5&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trinitrophenyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;amine (PicADNP), a new high energy density booster explosive. This exciting material exhibits an increased thermal stability and lower sensitivities towards external stimuli than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art material PETN, while maintaining a comparable performance.

Abstract
An easy synthesis of photochromic vinylnaphthofurans by the acid&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot reaction of naphthols with but&#8208;2&#8208;yne&#8208;1,4&#8208;diols is described. These uncolored polyaromatic compounds are activated by UV light, at room temperature, and converted through a stilbene&#8208;type electrocyclization into a thermally stable orange species, which can be switched back using visible light. The behavior of these photoswitches was elucidated using NMR, which allowed to identify the photoisomers and some side&#8208;products, formed after prolonged UV irradiation.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Functionalization of Diaryl 1,3,5&#8208;Triazines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 13, Page 2006-2012, April 8, 2021. </description>

Diaryltriazines are widely distributed in functional materials such as MOFs, COFs, and OLEDs. Herein, a catalytic C&#8722;H activation strategy is developed to install diverse functional groups including acetoxy, benzoxy, methoxy, chloro, and bromo into diaryltriazines. This protocol might have potential applications for the preparation and modification of those functional materials.







Abstract
Diaryl 1,3,5&#8208;triazines are not only important linkers in various covalent&#8208; and metal&#8208;organic frameworks but also versatile electron acceptors in host materials for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). We herein report C&#8722;H acetoxylation, benzoxylation, methoxylation, and halogenation of a diverse array of diaryl 1,3,5&#8208;triazines under palladium catalysis. Both symmetrical and nonsymmetrical diaryltriazines are viable substrates. This work offers a potential alternative to the existing methods in preparation or modification of functional materials.

Abstract
Two improved, fast, feasible, scalable, and economic synthetic protocols for the laboratory scale manufacturing of 3,5&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trinitrophenyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;amine (PicADNP) are described. The previous set of analytical data from an earlier publication could be verified and complemented by additional measurements. The material was fully characterized by multinuclear NMR, spectroscopic methods, elemental analysis, DSC and DTA, as well as X&#8208;ray diffraction. The crystal structure was elucidated and Hirshfeld surface analysis, as well as 2D fingerprint plot analysis for the assessment of sensitivities towards external stimuli was applied. The sensitivity towards shock, friction and electrostatic discharge was also determined experimentally. The performance of the title compound was calculated by applying the EXPLO5 computer code and the theoretical results were compared with the results of SSRT and booster testing experiments. The title compound combines good energetic properties with improved safety characteristics and could find its way into application as a new booster explosive to replace the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art material PETN. The optimizations of the synthetic protocol comprise a greener solvent system, shorter reaction times, higher yields for the pure material and a nontoxic byproduct to make the manufacturing process more attractive and better suitable for a subsequent scale up to the technical and industrial scale.

         <title>The Aza Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction on Brominated Conjugated Dienes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 13, Page 2003-2005, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of relatively complex, nitrogen&#8208;enriched tricyclic products from brominated acyclic keto&#8208;alkynes has been achieved in only two steps with an excellent overall yield. The use of PTAD as a dienophile has proved to be critical in aza Diels&#8208;Alder reactions with halogenated dienes.







Abstract
The use of electron&#8208;deficient dienes as substrates in the aza Diels&#8208;Alder reaction (ADA) has been studied scarcely. However, the ADA process offers a wide range of applications in organic synthesis. In this communication, the reaction between different brominated conjugated dienes and 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;dione (PTAD), one of the most vigorous dienophiles, is reported. We have synthesized tricyclic compounds from acyclic substrates in only two steps, considering variables such as ring size and steric hindrance and substantially improved the results obtained with other dienophiles.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2&#8722;H)&#8208;Trifluoromethylation of Aldehyde Hydrazones with Langlois Reagent</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 13, Page 2018-2024, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C(sp2&#8722;H)&#8208;trifluoromethylation of aromatic aldehyde N&#8208;aminomorpholine hydrazones has been achieved under free&#8208;radical conditions through Cu(II) catalysis using the cost&#8208;effective Langlois reagent (sodium trifluoromethanesulfinate). The reaction tolerates a series of electron&#8208;releasing as well as electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on the aromatic ring.







Abstract
The C(sp2&#8722;H)&#8208;trifluoromethylation of hydrazones would give access to the &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylated hydrazones that can serve as intermediates in the synthesis of pharmaceutically interesting fluorinated compounds. Herein, we demonstrate the Cu&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2&#8722;H)&#8208;trifluoromethylation of the aldehyde hydrazones using the readily available and cost effective Langlois reagent (sodium trifluoromethanesulfinate). This reaction is broadly applicable to a series of aromatic aldehyde N&#8208;aminomorpholine hydrazones to give the corresponding C(sp2)&#8208;trifluoromethyl hydrazones in moderate to high yields. The reaction generally tolerates a series of electron&#8208;releasing as well as electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on the aromatic ring.

         <title>A Three&#8208;Step Synthesis of 4H&#8208;Cyclopenta[def]phenanthrene from Pyrene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 13, Page 2013-2017, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
CPP is a valuable building block in the production of photoactive materials. A short and economical synthesis route to this material is thus much desired. We here report a three&#8208;step procedure, starting from pyrene, which allows access to this material on a gram scale. Our route is characterized by the use of relatively non&#8208;hazardous materials and fully optimized purification protocols.







Abstract
4H&#8208;Cyclopenta[def]phenanthrene (CPP) is a valuable building block in the production of photoactive polymers, which find use in a wide range of organic electronic applications. Of particular importance is their use in the development of blue&#8208;colored, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), which remains a challenge in the field. Unfortunately, commercial sources and synthetic procedures known in the literature are unable to provide enough CPP for large scale implementation. Herein, we report on the development of a novel, gram&#8208;scale synthesis of CPP in three steps, starting from pyrene. The key steps in our methodology are the ring contraction of pyrene&#8208;4,5&#8208;dione to oxoCPP in a single step, as well as the direct reduction of oxoCPP to CPP.

     alt="A Three&#8208;Step Synthesis of 4H&#8208;Cyclopenta[def]phenanthrene from Pyrene"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CPP is a valuable building block in the production of photoactive materials. A short and economical synthesis route to this material is thus much desired. We here report a three&#8208;step procedure, starting from pyrene, which allows access to this material on a gram scale. Our route is characterized by the use of relatively non&#8208;hazardous materials and fully optimized purification protocols.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Cyclopenta[&lt;i&gt;def&lt;/i&gt;]phenanthrene (CPP) is a valuable building block in the production of photoactive polymers, which find use in a wide range of organic electronic applications. Of particular importance is their use in the development of blue&#8208;colored, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), which remains a challenge in the field. Unfortunately, commercial sources and synthetic procedures known in the literature are unable to provide enough CPP for large scale implementation. Herein, we report on the development of a novel, gram&#8208;scale synthesis of CPP in three steps, starting from pyrene. The key steps in our methodology are the ring contraction of pyrene&#8208;4,5&#8208;dione to oxoCPP in a single step, as well as the direct reduction of oxoCPP to CPP. Apart from the small number of synthetic steps, our methodology benefits from the use of relatively non&#8208;hazardous reagents, together with optimized purification procedures, making CPP accessible in useful quantities.&lt;/p&gt;

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extended &#960; systems based on 1,1&#8217;&#8208;aryl or (2&#8208;arylethynyl) disubstitution at ferrocene with thioate or dithioate end groups are reported. In the context of molecular electronics such end groups are possible alternative end groups for the attachment of molecular wires at gold surfaces. The respective thioates were successfully prepared in high yields via the respective carboxylic acid derivatives. Subsequent treatment with Lawesson&#8217;s reagent led to the respective dithioates. However, this did not work in the presence of triple bonds, in these cases product mixtures were formed. On the basis of literature evidence with Woollin&#8217;s reagent, the selenium analogue of Lawesson&#8217;s reagent, one product was tentatively characterized as a double cyclization product of two triple bonds and two molecules of Lawesson&#8217;s reagent. Preliminary experiments towards the formation of gold complexes by reaction with a Johnphos gold (I) salt are included.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploiting the Versatility of Palladium Catalysis: A Modern Toolbox for Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization received much attention in organic synthesis due to its efficiency and rapid transformation of simple starting materials into complex molecular skeletons. Celebrating the 10th year of the prestigious Nobel prize for palladium chemistry, we witness it still proceeds strong over other transition metals for its versatility. Cascade reactions in contemporary organic synthesis reduced cost and time through careful design. It has emerged as the first choice, a powerful tool for multiple bond formations in one step with a wide range of functional group tolerance due to the deep understanding of various pathways. A variety of compounds with biological relevance with complex molecular scaffolds have been achieved using these cascade coupling reactions. This review outlines Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions from the post&#8208;Nobel era. Nevertheless, more discoveries and endless possibilities for new transformations are underway.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative C&#8722;H Cyanation of Quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones with TMSCN</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Both quinoxalin&#8208;2(1  H  )&#8208;ones and nitriles are valuable organic compounds, and it is an interesting task to introduce cyano into quinoxalin&#8208;2(1  H  )&#8208;ones. Herein a regioselective C&#8722;H cyanation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1  H  )&#8208;ones was developed with a nucleophilic cyano source TMSCN under electrochemical oxidative conditions. This process allowed the synthesis of C3 cyanated quinoxalin&#8208;2(1  H  )&#8208;ones in moderate to excellent yields in the absence of transition&#8208;metal catalysts and organic hydroperoxides.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Utility of a thermally stable divalent silicon species (silylene) toward the dehydroaromatization of a dihydropentacene is demonstrated. The reaction of a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)silylene with 6,13&#8208;dipropyl&#8208;5,14&#8208;dihydropentacene afforded the corresponding pentacene&#8208;silylene adducts. The reaction likely proceeds via a combination of 1,4&#8208;dehydrogenation and (1+4) cycloaddition of the silylene towards the dihydropentacene.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions of gem&#8208;Dibromovinyl BODIPY Derivatives.</title>

The structures of the resulting 1,1&#8208;diynyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkene and 1,1&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkene products were assigned using MS,  1  H NMR and in some cases X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. 1,1&#8208;Diynyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkene BODIPYs exhibit red shifted absorption maxima, particularly when substituents were introduced at the a&#8208;position rather than the b&#8208;position of the pyrrole ring. Aromatic compounds showed larger red shifts as compared to the aliphatic substituted analogs. The highest red shifts were observed with compounds featuring electron donating substituents.

The structures of the resulting 1,1&#8208;diynyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkene and 1,1&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkene products were assigned using MS,  1  H NMR and in some cases X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. 1,1&#8208;Diynyl&#8208;1&#8208;alkene BODIPYs exhibit red shifted absorption maxima, particularly when substituents were introduced at the a&#8208;position rather than the b&#8208;position of the pyrrole ring. Aromatic compounds showed larger red shifts as compared to the aliphatic substituted analogs. The highest red shifts were observed with compounds featuring electron donating substituents.

         <title>Donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor thienopyrazine&#8208;based dyes as NIR emitting AIEgens</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic Near&#8208;Infrared luminophores have found broad application as functional materials, but the development of efficient NIR emitters is still a challenging goal. Here we report on a new class of thieno[3,4&#8208;  b  ]pyrazine&#8208;based NIR emitting materials with Aggregation Induced Emission (AIE) properties. The dyes feature a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) structure, with a thienopyrazine acceptor core connected to two triarylamine donor groups bearing a tetraphenylethylene (TPE) moiety. Fast and efficient synthesis allowed the modular preparation of three dyes of tunable absorption and emission profiles. These constructs were extensively characterized by spectroscopic studies in different solvents, which revealed intense light&#8208;harvesting ability and emissions in the deep&#8208;red and NIR region with large Stokes shift values. Remarkably, the dyes exhibited AIE properties, retaining emissive ability in the aggregate state, thus emerging as attractive materials for their potential application in the development of luminescent devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric organocatalytic synthesis of aza&#8208;spirocyclic compounds from isothiocyanates and isocyanides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The spirocyclic motif is present in natural products, chiral ligands and compounds of pharmacological interest. Isothiocyanates as well as isocyanides bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups in the &#945;&#8208;position can be deprotonated and react as formal dipoles on account of the presence of a nucleophilic carbanion and an electrophilic atom in the isothiocyanate or isocyanide functional groups. In the last years a number of procedures involving the formal [3+2] cycloaddition reaction of isothiocyanates or isocyanides with cyclic compounds bearing electrophilic exocyclic double bonds have been developed for the enantioselective synthesis of aza&#8208;spirocyclic compounds. Among them, organocatalysis has played a predominant role in the development of asymmetric versions for these reactions. The synthesis of spirooxindoles by using this methodology has received especial attention, although other spirocyclic scaffolds are available depending on the structure of the dipolarophiles and the formal isothiocyanate and isocyanide dipoles.</dc:description>

         <title>Para&#8208;functionalization of N&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;amino[2.2]paracyclophanes by regioselective formylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a simple and convenient procedure to prepare para&#8208;disubstituted [2.2]paracyclophanes in a straightforward manner. Our approach relies on a regioselective formylation of N&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;amino[2.2]paracyclophanes, which allows an easy access to a series of products incorporating a reactive aldehyde function para to the electron&#8208;donating group. These compounds can be engaged in a variety of orthogonal late&#8208;stage derivatization processes involving either the carbonyl group or the amine function, and can serve as precursors to rapidly access more complex paracyclophane derivatives. Control of planar chirality is also possible by performing a kinetic resolution of key racemic intermediates through asymmetric transfer hydrogenation. The formylation can be run on a synthetically useful scale, thus confirming the practical applicability of our method.</dc:description>

         <title>Noncovalent Interactions between Stacked Arenes in 1,8&#8208;Bis&#8208;(1&#8208;naphthyl)&#8208;naphthalenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A number of 1,8&#8208;bis(1&#8208;naphthyl)&#8208;naphthalenes have been prepared with a combination of electron&#8208;rich and electron poor in the two 1&#8208;naphthyl rings. The conformational analysis by NMR and ECD spectroscopy, aided by DFT calculations, showed that the atropisomers ratio and the conformational preferences within each atropisomer are mainly due to the Coulombic interactions between the two facing rings.







Abstract
A number of 1,8&#8208;bis(1&#8208;naphthyl)&#8208;naphthalenes, bearing different substituents in the 1&#8208;naphthyl moieties have been prepared to investigate the noncovalent interactions between the stacked arenes. The best geometries were determined by means of DFT calculations, and experimentally checked by NMR and electronic circular dichroism (ECD). High temperature NMR spectroscopy allowed for the determination of the balance between dispersive and electrostatic contributions (ratio between two diastereomeric syn/anti isomers of compounds 1&#8211;6), while ECD analysis of the syn isomers of compounds 3&#8211;5 allowed for a deeper insight on the electrostatic contributions that drive the geometry between the interacting rings. The two rings preferentially adopt a parallel displaced geometry, whose interaction energy is strongly influenced by the electrostatic features of the two naphthyl rings, and that dispersive forces play a very minor role.

&lt;p&gt;A number of 1,8&#8208;bis(1&#8208;naphthyl)&#8208;naphthalenes have been prepared with a combination of electron&#8208;rich and electron poor in the two 1&#8208;naphthyl rings. The conformational analysis by NMR and ECD spectroscopy, aided by DFT calculations, showed that the atropisomers ratio and the conformational preferences within each atropisomer are mainly due to the Coulombic interactions between the two facing rings.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Synthetic Route to Benzothiazocines with Two or Three Carbon Stereocenters via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular N&#8208;Arylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new structural family of benzothiazocines bearing two or three carbon stereogenic centers on the 8&#8208;membered ring was synthesized by intramolecular Cu&#8208;catalyzed&#160;  N  &#8208;arylation. The chiral racemic 1,3&#8208;aminothioethers precursors have been prepared from easily available starting materials. An ionic organic base was used for the first time in an intramolecular C&#8208;N coupling, in medium&#8208;ring series, leading to higher yields than those obtained with an inorganic base, and a partial epimerization in some cases. The synthetic sequence was successfully performed on one example in asymmetric version, demonstrating the accessibility of enantioenriched benzothiazocines.</dc:description>

         <title>Ditopic hexadentate ligands with a central dihydrobenzo&#8208;diimidazole unit forming a [2x2] Zn4 grid complex</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A family of ditopic hexadentate ligands based on the parent compound 2,6&#8208;bis(6&#8208;(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,5&#8208;dihydrobenzo[1,2&#8208;d:4,5&#8208;d']diimidazole (  L  ) was developed and synthesized by using a straightforward condensation reaction, which forms the interlinking central benzo[1,2&#8208;d:4,5&#8208;d']diimidazole bridge in the ligand backbone. The two secondary amine groups of the benzodiimidazole unit tautomerize and allow the formation of two tauto&#8208;conformers, which upon treatment with metal salts forms different isomeric coordination complexes. Here we report six new derivatives (  1  &#8208;  6  ) that can tautomerize (varying the pyrazolylpyridine part) and 14 derivatives (  7  &#8208;  13  ) with different alkyl and benzyl substitution on secondary amino groups (of  L  ) that prevent the tautomerization. In this way, it is possible to study the properties of isomeric coordination complexes and their intrinsic cooperativity by the example of [2x2] grid complexes in the future. A [2x2] Zn  4  complex of the ligand  L  was synthesized and structurally characterized.</dc:description>

         <title>Stopped&#8208;Flow 19F NMR Spectroscopic Analysis of a Protodeboronation Proceeding at the Sub&#8208;Second Time&#8208;Scale</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In&#8208;situ NMR spectroscopic analysis of homogeneous reactions is an essential tool for mechanistic analysis in organic and organometallic chemistry. However, rapid non&#8208;equilibrium reactions that are initiated by mixing require specialist approaches. We report on a study of the factors that ensure quantitative results in a recently&#8208;developed technique for stopped&#8208;flow NMR spectroscopy. The influence of some of the key parameters on quantitation is studied by 19F NMR spectroscopic analysis of the kinetics and activation parameters for the base&#8208;catalyzed protodeboronation of highly&#8208;reactive polyfluorinated arylboronic acids, with half&#8208;lives as low as 0.1 seconds. The effects of spin relaxation, pre&#8208;magnetization, heat&#8208;transfer versus reaction enthalpy, and mixing&#8208;efficiency are analyzed in detail. We also compare and contrast choice of pulse angle, interscan delay, and use of pseudo real&#8208;time via interleaving, as means to achieve an optimal balance between temporal resolution and sensitivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of Electron&#8208;Rich Covalent Organic Frameworks COF&#8208;JLU25 for Photocatalytic Aerobic Oxidative Hydroxylation of Arylboronic Acids to Phenols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
COF&#8208;JLU25, a COF&#8208;based photocatalyst comprised solely of electron&#8208;donating units, 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene (PyTA) and 4&#8208;[4&#8208;(4&#8208;formylmethyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl] benzaldehyde (TpDA), demonstrated excellent photocatalytic activity with high efficiency, robust reusability, and low catalyst loading when used in catalyzing the oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organic reactions are environmentally friendly green chemical transformations among which photosynthetic oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids to phenols has attracted increasing research interest during the very recent years. Given the efficiency and reusability of heterogeneous catalysts, COF&#8208;JLU25, an electron&#8208;rich COF&#8208;based photocatalyst constructed by integrating electron&#8208;donating blocks 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene (PyTA) and 4&#8208;[4&#8208;(4&#8208;formylmethyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl] benzaldehyde (TpDA), was selected as a photocatalyst for the oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids. In our studies, COF&#8208;JLU25 demonstrated excellent photocatalytic activity with high efficiency, robust reusability, and low catalyst loading, showcasing an application potential of previously underexplored COF&#8208;based photocatalyst composed solely of electron&#8208;rich units.

Given the efficiency and reusability of heterogeneous catalysts, COF&#8208;JLU25, an electron&#8208;rich COF&lt;b&gt;&#8208;&lt;/b&gt;based photocatalyst constructed by integrating electron&#8208;donating blocks 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene (PyTA) and 4&#8208;[4&#8208;(4&#8208;formylmethyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl] benzaldehyde (TpDA), was selected as a photocatalyst for the oxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids. In our studies, COF&#8208;JLU25 demonstrated excellent photocatalytic activity with high efficiency, robust reusability, and low catalyst loading, showcasing an application potential of previously underexplored COF&#8208;based photocatalyst composed solely of electron&#8208;rich units.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Absence of Non&#8208;Linear Effects despite evidence for catalyst aggregation.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An in&#8208;depth study of the catalytic system, consisting of the enantioselective addition of ZnEt  2  to benzaldehyde with (1  R  ,2  S  )&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;N&#8208;Methylephedrine (NME) as chiral ligand, suggests the presence of dimeric and trimeric aggregates, as deduced from product ee vs catalyst loading and NMR investigations (  1  H, DOSY). Formation of catalyst aggregation was excluded in earlier studies as this system displays a linear product ee vs ligand ee&#8208;correlation, which is usually taken as an indication for the  absence  of catalyst aggregation. A subsequent theoretical study, using the monomer&#8208;dimer competition model we have recently developed, highlights the possible parameter configurations leading to linear product ee vs ligand ee plots &#8211; despite the presence of catalyst dimers. It shows that, while the Kagan and Noyori models allow linearity in very specific cases only, a multitude of scenarios may lead to linearity here, especially if heterochiral dimers are catalytically active.</dc:description>

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis, Structure and Properties of a Novel Class of Axially Chiral N&#8208;Aryl Quinolinium Salt</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterobiaryls containing a quaternized nitrogen within a chiral N&#8722;C axis occur in Nature and have been the target of several total syntheses. Here we reveal a general methodology towards enantio&#8208;enriched N&#8208;arylquinolinium salts, obtained via a four&#8208;step route from commercially available precursors and with axial stereochemistry controlled through an enantioselective ring&#8208;closing Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig coupling reaction.







Abstract
Inspired by naturally occurring molecules containing atropisomeric N+&#8208;C axes, we have developed a novel synthetic approach to generate a library of axially chiral N&#8208;aryl quinolinium salts. Enantiopurities up to 93&#8201;% ee were obtained via a four&#8208;step route from commercially available precursors. Axial stereochemistry was controlled through an enantioselective ring&#8208;closing Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig coupling reaction. The structure and properties of the salts were examined by X&#8208;ray crystallography, DFT, UV&#8208;Vis, and fluorescence spectroscopy, revealing high rotational barriers and solvatochromic behaviour.

         <title>2&#8208;(8&#8208;Iodonaphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;Substituted Nitronyl Nitroxide: Suppressed Reactivity of Iodine Atom and Unusual Temperature Dynamics of the EPR Spectrum</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cross&#8208;coupling of 1,8&#8208;diiodonaphthalene with an organogold nitronyl nitroxide stops at the monoradical with iodine atom at the peri&#8208;position toward the paramagnetic moiety. This arrangement causes a strong distortion of the nitroxide geometry and unprecedented temperature dynamics of the EPR spectrum. The latter can be explained by assuming different characteristic temperatures for averaging the anisotropy of the HFC tensors for N and I atoms.







Abstract
While developing methods for obtaining high&#8208;spin graphene nanostructures, we carried out a model cross&#8208;coupling reaction between 1,8&#8208;diiodonaphthalene and an organogold derivative of a nitronyl nitroxide. It was found that only one iodine atom reacted, leading to the corresponding 8&#8208;iodonaphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208;substituted nitronyl nitroxide. The latter was successfully isolated as two polymorphic modifications, whose X&#8208;ray structural analysis revealed a strong distortion of the paramagnet's geometry in comparison with a noniodinated analog. Moreover, the spatial proximity of the heavy iodine atom and the paramagnetic moiety resulted in unprecedented temperature dynamics of the EPR spectrum. To clarify these dynamics, quantum chemical calculations were performed using the exact two&#8208;component relativistic X2C method with the self&#8208;consistent account of spin&#8208;orbit coupling in conjunction with the B3LYP functional and relativistic STO&#8208;type basis set. These computations predicted a reasonable aiso(127I) value that can affect the EPR spectrum. Substitution of the second iodine atom would lead to the formation of a diradical with a 1,8&#8208;naphthalenediyl bridge, whose structure and magnetic properties were analyzed at the DFT level. Two stable conformations of the diradical with strongly distorted geometry were identified. In both conformations, calculations predict a ferromagnetic exchange between the paramagnetic centers with J=8 and 14&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (H=&#8722;2&#8197;J&#8901;S1S2).

         <title>Synthesis, cytotoxicity and leishmanicidal evaluation of ent&#8208;beyerene and ent&#8208;kaurene derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is an infectious disease endemic of tropical and subtropical countries. Current pharmacologic treatments have serious drawbacks. For these reasons, we need new and improved medical treatments. On the other side, natural products have been a valuable source of bioactive molecules, but unlike other products of natural origin, diterpenoids are molecules with only a few studies as antiparasitic drugs. Continuing our work on syntheses of beyerenes, and focusing on obtaining more compounds with antiparasitic activity, we describe in this work the syntheses and activity of several  ent  &#8208;beyerene and  ent  &#8208;kaurene type of compounds against CL, and also their toxicity. Utilizing classical reactions such as Grignard, Mitsunobu and Williamson, among others, it was possible to modify rings A and D of  ent  &#8208;beyerenes, specifically C&#8208;19 on ring A, and C&#8208;15 and C&#8208;16 on ring D. A total of 40 new compounds were obtained, 21 of them being active against  Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis  with median effective concentration (EC  50  ) values less than 25.0 mg/mL and of these with EC  50  values ranging from 1.8 to 7.1 mg/mL and Selectivity Index (SI) varying from 1.1 to 5.1. All compounds showed to be highly cytotoxic at concentrations less than 100 mg/mL, except compound  37  that was cytotoxic at 279.7 mg/mL and moderately active against  L. braziliensis  (EC  50  = 33.5 mg/mL and an SI of 8.4.

         <title>Oxoammonium&#8208;Mediated Allylsilane&#8211;Ether Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxoammonium&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;C(sp3) allylation of allyl&#8208; and benzyl ethers using allylsilanes as nucleophilic partners is disclosed. This new C&#8722;C bond forming C&#8722;H activation process allows to obtain the corresponding coupled products in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
A new C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization reaction consisting of the oxidative &#945;&#8208;allylation of allyl&#8208; and benzyl&#8208; methyl ethers has been developed. The C&#8722;C coupling could be carried out under mild conditions thanks to the use of cheap and green oxoammonium salts. The scope of the reaction was studied over 27 examples, considering the nature of the substituents on the two coupling partners.

         <title>Luminescent Ionic Liquid Crystals Based on Naphthalene&#8208;Imidazolium Unit</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convergence of fields of ionic liquid crystal chemistry, those of imidazolium salts, luminescence and liquid crystals, could lead to a wide range of new materials with original supramolecular properties. An efficient three&#8208;step synthetic method is developed in order to obtain luminescent naphthalene&#8208;imidazolium&#8208;anion compounds in the three states of matter: solid, liquid crystal, and liquid.







Abstract
In this article, we describe an efficient synthetic pathway and the characterization of liquid crystal luminescent imidazolium salts based on a naphthalene unit. The luminescent imidazolium&#8208;naphthalene rigid part is decorated with a benzyl group functionalized by two or three dodecyloxy chains. A crystalline structure shows unambiguously the segregation between the rigid ionic and flexible parts conducive to the emergence of mesomorphic properties. A complete thermotropic properties study of these salts has been carried out according to different anions. The alkyl tail number variation and therefore the amphipathic character (balance between hydrophilic/hydrophobic) makes it possible to induce liquid crystal state with different architectures of self&#8208;organization in layers (Smectic A) or columns (Columnar hexagonal). Finally, the photophysical properties were measured in solution and in the solid state at room temperature and showed photoluminescence quantum yields around 20&#8201;%.

         <title>Maleic Acid/Thiourea&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative ipso&#8208;Friedel&#8211;Crafts Reaction of Indoles to Produce Functionalized Spiroindolenines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A dearomative spirocyclization of diazo&#8208;functionalized indoles was developed under metal&#8208;free conditions. Although the spiroindolenine architecture with a tertiary alkyl substituent at the 2&#8208;position is a privileged scaffold of bioactive molecules, a general synthetic strategy has remained elusive. In this study, a dual catalyst system comprising maleic acid and Schreiner&#8217;s thiourea was used to construct a spiroindolenine core that was inaccessible via rhodium or silver catalysis. Computational studies revealed a unique macrocyclic transition state consisting of the substrate, maleic acid, and thiourea cocatalyst, which lowered the activation energy of spirocyclization via multipoint mutual interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Ru(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Hydroarylative Coupling of Indolines with Internal Alkynes via C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a regioselective hydroarylative coupling of indolines with internal alkynes via the activation of C&#8211;H bond using inexpensive Ru(II)&#8208;catalyst. This redox&#8208;neutral, atom&#8208;economical, and scalable C&#8211;H functionalization has been accomplished using easily removable weakly coordinating directing group. Diverse unsymmetrically substituted alkynes appended with pharmacologically important heterocycles were coupled with various indolines and 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines to furnish the corresponding trisubstituted alkenes with very high regioselectivity. The application of the method has been demonstrated with a number of alkyne&#8208;containing drug molecules, natural product, carbohydrates, amino acids, steroids and other heterocycles. Preliminary mechanistic interrogation revealed that the C&#8211;H activation proceeds through base&#8208;assisted internal electrophilic&#8208;type substitution process.</dc:description>

         <title>A kinetic photometric assay for the quantification of aldoses&#8217; open&#8208;chain content</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aldoses exist predominantly in the cyclic hemiacetal form, which is in equilibrium with the open&#8208;chain aldehyde form. The small aldehyde content hampers reactivity when chemistry addresses the carbonyl moiety. This low concentration of the available aldehyde is generally difficult to ascertain. Herein, we demonstrate a new kinetic determination of the (minute) open&#8208;chain content (OCC) of aldoses. This kinetic approach exploits the aldehyde&#8208;selectivity of 2&#8208;aminobenzamidoxime (ABAO), which furnishes a strongly UV&#8208;active adduct. Simple formation curves can be measured in a photometer or plate reader for high&#8208;throughput screening. Under pseudo&#8208;first order kinetics, these curves correlate with a prediction model yielding the relative OCC. The OCCs of all parent aldoses (pentoses and hexoses) were determined referencing against the two tetroses with exceptionally high OCCs and were in very good agreement with literature data. Additionally, the assay was extended towards higher&#8208;carbon sugars with unknown OCC and also applied to rationalise a lack of reactivity observed in a recent synthetic investigation.</dc:description>

         <title>A diversity&#8208;oriented approach to large libraries of artificial macrocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diversity&#8208;oriented approach to large artificial macrocycle libraries with a ring size of 13&#8211;18 atoms relying on the "build&#8208;couple&#8208;pair" strategy is disclosed. The "couple" phase included three one&#8208;pot steps including consequent amide coupling of N &#8208;Boc&#8208;mono&#173;protected vicinal diamines with two alkenyl carboxylic acids, followed by ring&#8208;closing metathesis as the key "pair" step. The scope and limitations of the method were established for all three reagents. In particular, various acyclic, mono&#8208; and bicyclic aliphatic diamine derivatives with the N&#8211;C&#8211;C&#8211;N dihedral angle less than ca. 130&#176; appeared to suitable substrates. The proposed approach was used to construct a virtual library of 1.8&#8901;10 5 macrocycles derived from 12,283 different scaffolds. More than 40% of members of this library contained a protected amino function and hence can be suitable for the post&#8208;pairing modification, thus giving a rise to at least a billion&#8208;size chemical space based on the REAL&#8208;type synthetic methodology. Validation of the approach under parallel synthesis conditions on a 383&#8208;member subset showed a 61% success rate over the whole 4&#8211;5&#8208;step reaction sequence. Finally, the synthetic approach also worked on a gram scale (up to 8.0 g).</dc:description>

In particular, various acyclic, mono&#8208; and bicyclic aliphatic diamine derivatives with the N&#8211;C&#8211;C&#8211;N dihedral angle less than ca. 130&#176; appeared to suitable substrates. The proposed approach was used to construct a virtual library of 1.8&#8901;10 5 macrocycles derived from 12,283 different scaffolds. More than 40% of members of this library contained a protected amino function and hence can be suitable for the post&#8208;pairing modification, thus giving a rise to at least a billion&#8208;size chemical space based on the REAL&#8208;type synthetic methodology. Validation of the approach under parallel synthesis conditions on a 383&#8208;member subset showed a 61% success rate over the whole 4&#8211;5&#8208;step reaction sequence. Finally, the synthetic approach also worked on a gram scale (up to 8.0 g).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biocatalytic Approaches to the Enantiomers of Wieland&#8208;Miescher Ketone and of Its Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biocatalytic approaches have been investigated in order to isolate the enantiomers of Wieland&#8208;Miescher ketone (  1  ) and of its alcoholic derivatives (  cis  &#8208;  2  and  trans&#8208;  3  ). Specifically, two enzymes from our in house metagenomic collection of oxidoreductases, IS2&#8208;SDR and Dm7&#945;&#8208;HSDH, catalyzed the kinetic resolution of the starting racemic ketone  1  or its complete conversion into two diastereomeric products, respectively. Moreover, the kinetic resolution of the racemic  cis  &#8208;alcohol (  2  ) was very efficiently obtained (E &#8773; 2.000) by lipase&#8208;PS catalyzed acetylation in dry acetone. All the products were isolated with e.e. &#8805; 95%. Simple chemical elaborations of some of them allowed to isolate the missing enantiomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective and additive&#8208;free hydrogenation of nitroarenes mediated by a DMSO&#8208;tagged molecular cobalt corrole catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the first cobalt corrole that effectively mediates the homogeneous hydrogenation of structurally diverse nitroarenes to afford the corresponding amines. The given catalyst is easily assembled prior to use from 4&#8208; tert &#8208;butylbenzaldehyde and pyrrole followed by metalation of the resulting corrole macrocycle with cobalt(II) acetate. The thus&#8208;prepared complex is self&#8208;contained in that the hydrogenation protocol is free from the requirement for adding any auxiliary reagent to elicit the catalytic activity of the applied metal complex. Moreover, a containment system is not required for the assembly of the hydrogenation reaction set&#8208;up as both the autoclave and the reaction vessels are readily charged under a regular laboratory atmosphere.</dc:description>

         <title>Planar and Rigid Pyrazine&#8208;Based TADF Emitter for Deep Blue Bright Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two blue donor&#8208;acceptor thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters containing pyrazine or dipyrazine as electron&#8208;acceptor are presented. The OLEDs based on these two emitters exhibited blue and sky&#8208;blue emission with CIE of (0.15,0.16) and (0.15, 0.30), respectively. The maximum external quantum efficiency for the blue device reached 11.6&#8201;% while for sky blue device it is 7.2&#8201;%.







Abstract
Two blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters bearing di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl carbazoles as the electron donor groups and pyrazine (DTCz&#8208;Pz) or dipyrazine (DTCz&#8208;Pz) as the electron acceptor are presented. The DFT calculations predict DTCz&#8208;Pz and DTCz&#8208;DPz to possess high S1 energies (3.19&#8197;eV and 3.08&#8197;eV, respectively), and relatively large &#916;EST values (0.52&#8197;eV and 0.56&#8197;eV, respectively). The closely layered intermediate triplet states between S1 and T1, predicted by DFT calculations, are expected to facilitate the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and improve spin&#8208;vibronic coupling efficiency between the excited states, even the relatively larger &#916;ESTs. The &#916;ESTs for DTCz&#8208;Pz and DTCz&#8208;DPz are 0.27&#8197;eV and 0.38&#8197;eV, and both molecules show high photoluminescence quantum yields (65&#8201;%, and 70&#8201;%, respectively). The decay lifetimes show temperature dependence in a PPT host, which is consistent with the fact that both molecules are TADF emitters in PPT. The OLEDs based on DTCz&#8208;Pz exhibit deep blue emission with &#955;EL of 460&#8197;nm and CIE of (0.15, 0.16). The maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) reaches 11.6&#8201;%, with a maximum luminance (Lmax) of up to 6892&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, while the device based on DTCz&#8208;DPz exhibits sky blue emission with &#955;EL of 484&#8197;nm and CIE of (0.15, 0.30), an EQEmax of 7.2&#8201;%, and Lmax of 8802&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.

&lt;p&gt;Two blue donor&#8208;acceptor thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters containing pyrazine or dipyrazine as electron&#8208;acceptor are presented. The OLEDs based on these two emitters exhibited blue and sky&#8208;blue emission with CIE of (0.15,0.16) and (0.15, 0.30), respectively. The maximum external quantum efficiency for the blue device reached 11.6&#8201;% while for sky blue device it is 7.2&#8201;%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters bearing di&#8208;&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;butyl carbazoles as the electron donor groups and pyrazine (&lt;b&gt;DTCz&#8208;Pz&lt;/b&gt;) or dipyrazine (&lt;b&gt;DTCz&#8208;Pz&lt;/b&gt;) as the electron acceptor are presented. The DFT calculations predict &lt;b&gt;DTCz&#8208;Pz&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;DTCz&#8208;DPz&lt;/b&gt; to possess high S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; energies (3.19&#8197;eV and 3.08&#8197;eV, respectively), and relatively large &#916;E&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; values (0.52&#8197;eV and 0.56&#8197;eV, respectively). The closely layered intermediate triplet states between S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, predicted by DFT calculations, are expected to facilitate the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and improve spin&#8208;vibronic coupling efficiency between the excited states, even the relatively larger &#916;E&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt;s. The &#916;E&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt;s for &lt;b&gt;DTCz&#8208;Pz&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;DTCz&#8208;DPz&lt;/b&gt; are 0.27&#8197;eV and 0.38&#8197;eV, and both molecules show high photoluminescence quantum yields (65&#8201;%, and 70&#8201;%, respectively). The decay lifetimes show temperature dependence in a PPT host, which is consistent with the fact that both molecules are TADF emitters in PPT. The OLEDs based on &lt;b&gt;DTCz&#8208;Pz&lt;/b&gt; exhibit deep blue emission with &#955;&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt; of 460&#8197;nm and CIE of (0.15, 0.16). The maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) reaches 11.6&#8201;%, with a maximum luminance (L&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of up to 6892&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, while the device based on &lt;b&gt;DTCz&#8208;DPz&lt;/b&gt; exhibits sky blue emission with &#955;&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt; of 484&#8197;nm and CIE of (0.15, 0.30), an EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 7.2&#8201;%, and L&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 8802&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Organocatalytic Amination of Pyrazolones with Azodicarboxylates: Scope and Limitations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric method for the amination of pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones using azo compounds is described. The developed process exhibits a wide substrate scope and high efficiency in terms of yield and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The organocatalytic amination of pyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones with azodicarboxylates (catalyzed by quinine) is reported. This asymmetric process furnishes enantiomerically enriched hydrazine adducts containing quaternary stereocenters in high yields (74&#8211;96&#8201;%) and enantioselectivities (up to ee 97&#8201;%). Theoretical calculations allow us to propose the relations between quinine catalyst and reactants leading to observed stereochemical outcome and trends in the effectivity of the reaction.

         <dc:description>
2,3&#8208;Dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) is a classic oxidation reagent in organic synthesis. Upon visible light excitation its oxidation potential is boosted beyond+3&#8197;V vs SCE. This property has been used for oxidative organic transformations and catalyst regeneration is achieved by air oxygen or electrochemically.







Abstract
The one&#8208;electron oxidizing capacity of 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) improves significantly by visible&#8208;light excitation. The exited&#8208;state DDQ (DDQ*) even converts benzene, fluoroarenes, heteroarenes, benzyls, and olefins into their corresponding radical cations as well as chloride and other anions into their radicals. These reactive intermediates have been utilized for the generation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X (N, O, or Cl) bonds in the synthesis of valuable organic compounds and natural products. This mini review provides an overview of such DDQ*&#8208;initiated organic transformations with their scope and limitations and discusses the proposed reactions mechanisms.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coumarin, xanthene, BODIPY, and cyanine are four of the most prevalent bioimaging scaffolds in chemical biology. In this review, we summarize the synthesis, structure&#8208;photophysical properties relationships, and imaging applications of fluorophores based on these units. We review the advantages and disadvantages of each scaffold in bioimaging as well as the practical issues to consider when using small organic compounds in biological systems.

         <title>Monoprotected Diamines Derived from 1,5&#8208;Disubstituted (Aza)spiro[2.3]hexane Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted (aza)spiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. Structural characterization of the obtained spirocyclic compounds provided a rationale for their applications in design of saturated ring isosteres and peptidomimetics.







Abstract
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5&#8208;disubstituted spiro[2.3]hexane and 5&#8208;azaspiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. In both cases, the method relied on the cyclopropanation of the corresponding cyclobutane or azetidine derivatives. In the case of monoprotected 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexanes, the title products were obtained as single diastereomers. X&#8208;Ray diffraction studies supported by exit vector plot (EVP) analysis showed that the obtained building blocks are promising piperidine/cycloalkane isosteres with potential utility to drug discovery. Also, conformations observed in the crystalline state for the two different diastereomers of 1,5&#8208;diaminospiro[2.3]hexane derivatives prompt their application in design of &#946;&#8208;turn and sheet&#8208;like peptidomimetics, respectively.

         <title>Last of the gem&#8208;Difluorocycloalkanes 2: Synthesis of Fluorinated Cycloheptane Building Blocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isomeric gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane derivatives were obtained in two to six synthetic steps from readily available starting materials. The developed synthetic approaches were shown to be efficient for a multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of target compounds and involved six&#8208;membered ring homologation and/or deoxofluorination reactions as the key steps.







Abstract
The gem&#8208;difluorocycloalkane family was extended to all possible regioisomers of the gem&#8208;difluorocycloheptane, monofunctionalized by carboxilic&#8208;, amino&#8208; or keto&#8208; group, that were synthesized on a multigram scale. The preparation of the corresponding building blocks was achieved from readily accessible starting materials either via six&#8208;membered ring homologation or deoxofluorination of the appropriate seven&#8208;membered cyclic ketones.

         <title>Reaction of N,N&#8208;Disubstituted Polyfluoroalkanethioamides with Diazomethane: Entry to New Thiirane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4&#8208;dioxane derivatives are discussed.






New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between N,N&#8208;disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

  Multigram synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates relying on efficient 4&#8211;5&#8208;step reaction sequences is described. The title compounds was obtained in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield).
  
  
  
  
 
 
  An approach to the synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates on a multigram scale was developed. Two synthetic strategies were evaluated: the first based on the lithiation&#8211;borylation of the corresponding 2&#8208;bromoallyl derivatives, and the other relying on regioselective hydroboration of the appropriate hetera&#8208;substituted enynes. The second method appeared to be more efficient in terms of scalability and substrate scope. Further steps included ring closing&#8208;metathesis, mild palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation with diazomethane, and reaction with KHF2 and furnished the title compounds in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield, 4&#8211;5 steps).

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;Sultams by One&#8208;Pot Reductive Cyclization of Cyanoalkylsulfonyl Fluorides</title>

  A multigram synthesis of spirocyclic &#947;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;sultams is reported, which are advanced building blocks for organic synthesis and drug discovery. The synthesis proceeds through a one&#8208;pot reductive cyclization of cyclic cyano sulfonyl fluorides.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  One&#8208;pot intramolecular cyclization of novel sp3&#8208;enriched cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluorides into spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;sultams is disclosed. The method relies on nitrile group reduction followed by sulfonylation of amino group thus formed upon mild conditions (NaBH4, NiCl2&#183;6H2O in MeOH). Cyclization proceeds smoothly with considerable efficiency (48&#8211;84&#8201;%, 10 examples) on up to 30 g scale. The cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluoride intermediates can be obtained via S&#8208;nucleophilic substitution in &#946;&#8208;functionalized alkanenitriles or double alkylation of &#945;&#8208;alkylthioacetonitrile, followed by oxidative chlorination with Cl2 and further reaction with KHF2. The title mono&#8208; and bifunctional sultams are advanced sp3&#8208;enriched building blocks for drug discovery and organic synthesis providing novel substitution patterns and frameworks mimicking saturated nitrogen heterocycles such as pyrrolidine/pyrrolidone.
