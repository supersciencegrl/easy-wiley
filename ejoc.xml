         <title>Utilizing Baylis&#8211;Hillman Adducts Followed by Michael Addition/Elimination Reaction for the Synthesis of Unusual Conformationally Stable Molecules Governed by Aromatic Interactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using Baylis&#8208;Hillman (B&#8211;H) and Michael addition processes, the compounds under study have independently sought a novel path for their synthesis. Through a repetition reaction including many different nucleophiles, the veracity of the end result generation was examined. The additional stability of the product via aromatic &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions may be the cause of the unexpected product formation in numerous reactions carried out with varied starting materials. This study comes to the conclusion that weak contacts play an important role in molding the final product as well as supplying selectivity during reactions.







Abstract
The compounds under investigation sought a new approach to synthesis via the Baylis&#8208;Hillman (B&#8722;H) and Michael addition reactions. The product formation&#8216;s legitimacy was tested using a repeat reaction with many different nucleophiles. The additional stability of the product via aromatic &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions may result in unexpected product formation in diverse reactions undertaken utilizing different starting materials. This study suggests that weak interaction not only provides selectivity during reactions but also modifies the result.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Linked Pseudopeptides via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonylative Coupling of &#945;&#8208;Amino Acid Iodides with &#945;&#8208;Amino Acid Esters in the Presence of a CO Surrogate</title>

         <dc:description>
This method provides previously inaccessible phenylalanine&#8208; and histidine&#8208;containing pseudodipeptides and tripeptides through palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative coupling using chloroform as a CO surrogate under microwave irradiation at 80&#8201;&#176;C in 45&#8197;min.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of cross&#8208;linked pseudopeptides through a palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The reaction involves the coupling of &#945;&#8208;amino acid iodides with &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters via in&#8197;situ CO insertion to give pseudopeptides linked by the side chain of the electrophilic counterpart. The key features are the use of a sustainable in&#8197;situ CO surrogate, simple non&#8208;inert conditions, short reaction time, and broad substrate scope. Both amino acids and peptide iodides were utilized as coupling partners.

         <title>Organocatalytic Synthesis of 2,3,4,9&#8208;Tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;carbazole Embedded Styrene Atropisomers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first organocatalytic synthesis of 2,3,4,9&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;carbazole embedded styrene atropisomers has been developed. The styrene derivatives were isolated in good to high yields with high diastereoselectivities. Moderate enantioselectivities were achieved with a chiral catalyst.







Abstract
Herein we report the first synthesis of tetrahydrocarbazole embedded styrene atropisomers via the reaction between 1&#8208;(aryl&#8208;ethynyl)&#8208;naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol and 2,3,4,9&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;carbazole. The reaction proceeds through in&#8197;situ vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methide (VQM) intermediate formation. The styrene derivatives were obtained in good to high yields with high diastereoselectivities with a catalytic amount of PTSA. A catalytic asymmetric version is also reported.

Novel 2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;4&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;Ethylene&#8208;bridged Nucleic Acid (ENA) monomers bearing an alkyl substituent at the 7&#8217;&#8208;position, respectively 7&#8217;&#8208;(S)&#8208;Me&#8208;ENA and 7&#8217;&#8208;(S)&#8208;Et&#8208;ENA, were synthesized. The bicyclic structures were built thank to a key ring&#8208;closing metathesis step and a subsequent stereoselective reduction of the cyclic enol ether moiety.







Abstract
Derivatives of 2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;4&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;Ethylene&#8208;bridged Nucleic Acid (ENA) monomer, a nucleoside used in the preparation of antisense modified oligonucleotides and featuring an alkyl group in position 7&#8217;, are stereoselectively produced in nine steps from commercially available 3&#8208;O&#8208;benzyl&#8208;4&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)&#8208;1,2&#8208;O&#8208;isopropylidene&#8208;alpha&#8208;D&#8208;ribofuranose.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we have reported an effective semi&#8208;synthetic strategy for the synthesis of a new class of triazole&#8208;bearing alkenylated benzosuberene analogues from himachalenes, extracted from Cedrus deodara oil. A highly efficient 1,2,3&#8208;triazole triggered Heck cross&#8208;coupling has been developed under palladium catalyzed conditions. The 1,2,3&#8208;triazole moiety helps significantly to activate the carbon&#8208;halogen bond and thereby promotes the coupling product. The developed protocol endures an array of arylated as well as alkylated triazole&#8208;substituted benzocycloheptene to achieve the corresponding products in moderate to good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>A Strategy for Improving the Efficiency of Boronic Acid Catalysis in the Synthesis of Amides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 45, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel boronic acids have been developed for the catalyzed amide synthesis. Lewis acidity estimation using DFT, associated with collected kinetic data, allowed to uncover ortho&#8208;(sulfonyloxy)benzeneboronic acids that compared favorably with the established state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art boronic acids. Efficient coupling of aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroaromatic carboxylic acids as well as primary and secondary amines were obtained.







Abstract
This study outlines the development of novel boronic acids as catalysts for the direct synthesis of amides from carboxylic acids and amines. The Lewis acidity of the boronic acids was estimated by means of computational techniques, and the observed increase in catalytic activity was corroborated by kinetic data derived from a model reaction. Our investigations led to the discovery of a set of ortho&#8208;(sulfonyloxy)benzeneboronic acids that compared favorably with the established state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. These newly developed catalysts demonstrated efficacy in the coupling of aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroaromatic acids, as well as primary and secondary amines.

A novel approach to perform C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H functionalization at the C6 position of 7&#8208;azaindazoles is reported. This method employs regioselective oxidative arylation, facilitated by N&#8208;oxide activation. By utilizing this technique, precise and innovative synthesis of C6&#8208;arylated 7&#8208;azaindazoles using various substituted arenes and heteroarenes is achieved.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Hydrohalogenation and Deuteriohalogenation by Ex Situ Generation of HX and DX Gas</title>

Solvent&#8208;free hydro&#8208; and deuteriohalogenation of olefins by ex situ generation of near&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of hydrogen and deuterium halide gas using a two&#8208;chamber reactor. Upon chemo&#8208; and regioselective conversion of the substrate, the halide products may be isolated without the need for any work&#8208;up or purification steps making it a clean and labor&#8208;, waste&#8208; and cost&#8208;effective method.







Abstract
The hydrohalogenation of olefins is one of the most straightforward methods to access alkyl halides. Despite safety hazards, using pure hydrogen halide gas remains the most atom economic way of performing hydrohalogenation reactions. In this work, we describe the solvent&#8208;free hydro&#8208; and deuteriohalogenation of olefins using down to near&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of hydrogen and deuterium halide gas. Two&#8208;chamber reactors are employed as an enabling platform to access these reactive gases in a laboratory setting. Ex situ generation from inexpensive and readily available precursors provides on&#8208;demand access to these gases (hydrogen chloride, deuterium chloride, hydrogen bromide, deuterium bromide, hydrogen iodide, and deuterium iodide) with precise stoichiometric control. Upon chemo&#8208; and regioselective conversion of the substrate, the halide products may be isolated without the need for any work&#8208;up or purification steps making it a clean and labor&#8208;, waste&#8208; and cost&#8208;effective method.

         <title>An Efficient Chemoenzymatic Route to Biologically Active Pyridinic Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 45, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of optically active pyridinic and dipyridinic ethanamines have been prepared by means of a chemoenzymatic route starting from 1,2&#8208;disubstituted ethanones. Two features of the strategy need to be he highlighted: the highly enantioselective ketoreductase (KRED)&#8208;catalyzed reduction of the starting ketones, and the efficient transformation of the resulting optically active alcohols into the target primary amines.







Abstract
Starting from the easily prepared 1&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208; or 1&#8208;(4&#8208;chloropyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;ones bearer of different substituents (cyclohexyl, phenyl, pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl) in the position 2, the corresponding primary pyridinic ethanamines have been synthesized in very high enantiomeric excesses (ee&#8805;97&#8201;%). The strategy involves a highly enantioselective ketoreductase (KRED) catalyzed reduction, mesylation of the resulting optically active alcohol followed by nucleophilic substitution with azide anion and, finally, reduction of the azide function. Some of these pyridinic amines obtained in such manner are precursors of biologically active compounds such as Ontazolast.

         <title>DABCO&#8208;Promoted Bicyclization/Rearrangement Reaction Synthesis of Tetrasubstituted Furans and Furo[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones from 1,4&#8208;Enediones</title>

A DABCO&#8208;promoted bicyclization/rearrangement reaction has been developed for the synthesis of polysubstituted furans, which produced to furo[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones under heating conditions.







Abstract
A DABCO&#8208;promoted bicyclization/rearrangement reaction has been developed for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted furans from 1,4&#8208;enediones at room temperature. This transformation involves aza&#8208;Michael addition, intramolecular bicyclization, and rearrangement processes. In addition, the 4&#8208;ureidofuran&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylate ester products can further be converted to furo[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones through intramolecular substitution cyclization under heating conditions.

         <title>Synthesis of Donor Substituted Chlorophyll Derivatives for Applications in Dye Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 45, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The power of photosynthesis can provide a blueprint for environmentally friendly approaches for sustainable production of green renewable energy and organic matter by artificial photosynthesis. Chlorophylls themselves produced by nature as an almost unlimited resource mark them as attractive pigments for application in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC).







Abstract
Organic dyes based on chlorophyll derivatives were synthesized and investigated with respect to applications in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC). Cyanobacterium Spirulina platensis cultivated on large scales in tropical areas around the Pacific Ocean is an attractive source for production and isolation of pure chlorophyll a. Direct transformation of chlorophyll a into very robust chlorin e6 trimethylester 3 affords an ideal platform for synthesis of dyes for artificial photosynthesis. A series of molecules 24&#8211;32 with donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor structures and functional groups for immobilization on TiO2 were achieved by subsequent synthetic modifications of 3. Photochemical, theoretical and electrochemical properties of dyes were investigated and their sensitized solar cells performances studied after immobilization on TiO2.

A metal&#8208;free formylation of imidazopyridines with K2S2O8 by direct decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling of glyoxylic acid is described. This reaction features broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and generate products in good yields.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free formylation of imidazopyridines by direct decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling of glyoxylic acid in presence of K2S2O8 as oxidant under mild and neutral conditions is described. This reaction features a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and generates products in good yields between 68&#8211;85&#8201;%. The translational capacity of the reaction from a laboratory methodology to gram&#8208;scale synthesis has also been ensured. The involvement of a radical pathway has been demonstrated by radical trapping experiments with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) and 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenol (BHT).

         <title>Radical Thiocyano(Selenocyano)trifluoromethylations of Alkenes on Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 45, December 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable platform has been established to synthesize valuable &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylated thio(seleno)cyanates in a green way. Using PhICF3Cl as unique CF3 agent and NaSCN as the SCN source, the difunctionalization of alkenes selectively occurs on water at ambient condition. Mechanism studies suggest a radical process in which SCN anion is proposed to act as not only reductive initiator but also S&#8208;nucleophile. This method is also suitable for the selenocyanotrifluoromethylation of alkenes.







Abstract
Trifluoromethylation&#8208;based difunctionalization of alkenes provides a step&#8208;economical route to CF3&#8208;containing polyfunctionalized organics. New and scalable processes are highly desired in this field. Here, we report a simple and environmentally benign method for olefinic thiocyanotrifluoromethylation. Using PhICF3Cl as unique CF3 agent and NaSCN as the SCN source, the difunctionalization of alkenes selectively occurs on water at ambient condition. Mechanism studies suggest a radical process in which SCN anion is proposed to act as not only reductive initiator but also S&#8208;nucleophile. All tested reactions are compatible with mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;substituted alkenes and with high functional group tolerance. This method is also suitable for the selenocyanotrifluoromethylation of alkenes. Therefore, a sustainable platform has been established to synthesize valuable &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylated thio(seleno)cyanates in a green way.

A simple and straightforward method is developed for the enantioselective synthesis of indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl&#8208;piperidine with good yields and high enantioselectivity. The reaction proceeds through a proline&#8208;catalyzed direct Mannich reaction between glutaraldehyde and C3&#8208;indolyl&#8208;imines, followed by intramolecular reductive cyclization as an overall [4+2] annulation in one&#8208;pot fashion.

         <title>Enhanced Long&#8208;Term Stability of a Photosensitizer with a Hydroxamic Acid Anchor in Dye&#8208;Sensitized Photocatalytic Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 45, December 1, 2023. </description>

Phenothiazine sensitizer bearing hydroxamic acid terminal anchoring groups in place of conventional carboxylic acid units showed enhanced long&#8208;term photocatalytic hydrogen generation in the typical aqueous device medium. These findings can play a relevant role for commercial production of green hydrogen.







Abstract
Climate change mitigation on a global scale will only be possible through the achievement of ambitious decarbonisation goals, requiring an energy transition that involves switching from fossil fuels to clean fuels such as hydrogen. The photocatalytic approach is one of the most studied methods for directly converting sunlight into hydrogen. In this work, we present the synthesis, characterization, and application of the PTZ1&#8208;HA dye, which was obtained by replacing the terminal conventional carboxylic anchoring moieties of a previously studied phenothiazine&#8208;based dye (PTZ1) with hydroxamic acid functionalities. The photoinduced performance of the two dyes as photosensitizers was compared in both dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells and dye&#8208;sensitized photocatalytic systems. PTZ1&#8208;HA&#8208;sensitized photocatalysts showed improved stability in hydrogen generation due to the introduction of the hydroxamic acid as an alternative anchor group, which was shown to slow down hydrolysis in aqueous media. Even though the light harvesting ability of PTZ1&#8208;HA was lower than that of PTZ1, the higher stability of PTZ1&#8208;HA&#8208;sensitized devices allowed for improved photocatalytic generation of H2 over prolonged periods. The superior long&#8208;term efficiency of the hydroxamic acid based dye is important in view of potential practical applications.

An asymmetric protocol for the syntheses of novel &#948;&#8208;lactams by utilizing a synergistic chiral isothiourea/achiral Pd&#8208;catalyst combination for the &#945;&#8208;allylation of activated aryl esters followed by deprotection/cyclization has been successfully established.







Abstract
We herein report a two&#8208;step approach for the enantioselective synthesis of novel chiral &#948;&#8208;lactams. By using a cooperative chiral ITU/achiral Pd&#8208;catalyst system, this protocol proceeds via an asymmetric &#945;&#8208;allylation of activated aryl esters first, followed by an acid&#8208;mediated lactam formation. A variety of differently substituted products could be obtained with usually high levels of enantioselectivities and in reasonable yields (16 examples, up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 er and 73&#8201;% yield over two steps). In addition, further utilizations of the products via transformations of the exocyclic double bond were successfully carried out as well.

Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed additions of carbon electrophiles to carbonyls, imines and carboxylic acid derivatives are reviewed. The review is organized based on the nature of the reductant used for generation of the active low&#8208;valent Co&#8208;species: chemical and photochemical reduction strategies. The mechanistic aspects of the strategies are also summarized.







Abstract
The addition of carbon electrophiles to carbonyls and imines has emerged as a valuable strategy for the construction of C&#8722;C bonds. The merger of this concept with sustainable cobalt catalysis has yielded numerous innovative methodologies. Remarkable functional group tolerance and selectivity have been observed in many cases, providing reliable methods for bond construction. The cobalt&#8208;catalyzed additions of carbon electrophiles to carbonyls, imines and carboxylic acid derivatives described in this review include the earliest reports, such as Takai&#8208;Utimoto Co/Cr co&#8208;catalyzed additions and their progression, as well as modern variants, exemplified by recent Co/photoredox co&#8208;catalyzed protocols. The systematic appraisal of this modern strategy provides a clearer perspective and inspiration for its further development.

Efficient de novo access to 2,3&#8208;7&#8208;trisubstituted pyrazolo[5,1&#8208;b]oxazoles was successfully synthesized via a regioselective Palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The scope of each palladium&#8208;catalyzed reaction at each position showed excellent compatibility with a wide range of boronic acids or bromoaryl derivatives.







Abstract
A first access to mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;(Het)arylated pyrazolo[5,1&#8208;b]oxazoles is reported. The series were generated from a library of 3&#8208;(Het)arylpyrazolo[5,1&#8208;b]oxazole platforms selectively functionalized through regioselective arylation procedures. The regioselective functionalization in C&#8208;2 and C&#8208;7 positions was investigated. Each Palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling condition was optimized and a representative library of the scope and limitations of the reactions was studied.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Pyridofluoranthenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridofluoranthenes (fluorenoquinolines and &#8208;isoquinolines), N&#8208;doped benzo[b]fluoranthenes, were synthesized by combination of Pd catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling with CH&#8208;activation reactions. By variation of the starting material, four regioisomeric products, containing a nitrogen atom at various positions of the outer benzene ring of the core structure, were selectively prepared. The optical, electrochemical and electronic properties of the products were studied and compared with each other using experimental methods and DFT/TD&#8208;DFT and NICS calculations.







Abstract
A series of N&#8208;doped Benzo[b]fluoranthenes was synthesized. Specifically varying the position of the Nitrogen atom in all four positions of the bottom ring. In the last reaction step the five&#8208;membered ring of the unsubstituted core structure is formed by palladium catalyzed CH&#8208;activation. This synthetic approach allows for the selective introduction of heteroatoms into the core structure and leads to four regioisomeric products. Subsequently the optical and electrochemical properties of these polyaromatic heterocycles were compared. DFT/TD&#8208;DFT and NICS calculations were performed to further analyze, how the position of Nitrogen impacts the overall characteristics of the molecules. This composes a thorough study on the chemical behavior of N&#8208;doped Benzo[b]fluoranthenes.

         <title>Organocatalyzed Kinetic Resolution of Racemic Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods for the organocatalyzed kinetic resolution of racemic carboxylic acids are reviewed to elucidate the current status of this research. Esterification and lactonization promoted by chiral organocatalysts are elucidated as examples of the effective transformations for the kinetic resolution of important chiral carboxylic acids.







Abstract
The kinetic resolution of racemic compounds is a reliable method to prepare important chiral molecules in highly optically enriched forms. Although methods for the catalytic kinetic resolution of chiral alcohols, amines, and epoxides have been extensively investigated, the kinetic resolution of racemic carboxylic acids has remained under&#8208;developed despite the importance of chiral carboxylic acids. Excellent catalytic approaches for the kinetic resolution of racemic carboxylic acids via esterification using chiral organocatalysts have been reported by several research groups. Furthermore, the organocatalyzed lactonization of alkenyl and alkynyl carboxylic acids has also been adapted to achieve kinetic resolution. Herein, the methods typically used to produce the organocatalyzed kinetic resolution of racemic carboxylic acids are reviewed to elucidate the current status of this research.

         <title>Accessing Functionalized Tetrazines as Click Chemistry Tools: A Synthesis Guide for Chemists and Chemical Biologists</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the first report that 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazines undergo a bioorthogonal reaction with dienophiles in the form of an inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, the demand for high&#8208;yielding synthetic approaches toward them grew steadily. Despite this significant interest, tetrazines were predominantly accessed via the Pinner synthesis or other Pinner&#8208;like reactions, significantly limiting available substrates. In particular, the synthesis of unsymmetrically substituted s&#8208;tetrazines for the selective conjugation to another species presented a major challenge. To tackle these challenges, new and innovative high&#8208;yielding transformations have been developed to widen the scope of accessible symmetric and unsymmetric tetrazines. For instance, Ni(II), Zn(II), and sulfur&#8208;catalyzed reactions between two nitriles and hydrazine were developed, which provide access to a wide range of aryl (un&#8208;)symmetric s&#8208;tetrazines. Also, amidines and orthoesters give tetrazines with alkyl substituents, whereas the usage of CH2Cl2&#160;yields valuable H&#8208;monosubstituted tetrazines. Methods using thiocarbohydrazides, terminal fluoroolefins, oxetane esters, or tosyl hydrazones are among the recent additions.&#160;Due to the high interest in tetrazine click&#8208;chemistry approaches, some of which reach beyond inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, we expect this overview of synthetic routes to aid the exploration for further applications of tetrazines. Ultimately, we hope to provide a guide for chemists and chemical biologists for accessing functional s&#8208;tetrazines.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
This works describes a new, straightforward, highly efficient, and mild catalytic protocol for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;tertiary propargylamines, via the multicomponent KA2 reaction (Ketone&#8208;Amine&#8208;Alkyne), employing well&#8208;defined, sustainable copper(I) complexes bearing N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands.







Abstract
A new, straightforward, highly efficient, and mild catalytic protocol for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;tertiary propargylamines, via the multicomponent KA2 reaction (Ketone&#8208;Amine&#8208;Alkyne), employing well&#8208;defined, sustainable copper(I) complexes bearing N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands, is reported herein. The methodology uses very low catalyst loading under moderate heating to achieve the construction of a wide range of propargylamines in good to excellent yields in very short reaction times. Challenging substrates, including acyclic linear ketones, aromatic ketones, and electron&#8208;poor aromatic alkynes, as well as substrates bearing synthetically valuable functionalities, are well tolerated.

         <title>Methanol as a C1 Source for the Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Polyheterocyclic Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, efficient and low&#8208;cost procedure for the synthesis of 1,3&#8208;polyheterocyclic systems was reported, starting from the easily accessible aminoalcohols or diaminoalkanes, using CuCl2 as catalyst, H2O2, as inexpensive oxidant agent, and methanol acting both as solvent and reagent, proceeding under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
A very attractive approach toward 1,3&#8208;polyheterocyclic systems was provided exploiting the copper&#8208;catalyzed reaction of aminoalcohols and diaminoalkanes, in oxidative conditions and in the presence of methanol. The synthetic pathway showed the involvement of methanol both as solvent and as a reagent, making the procedure particularly efficient and sustainable for the synthesis of five&#8208;, six&#8208;, and seven&#8208;membered polyheterocyclic rings.

         <dc:description>
gem&#8208;Difluorinated 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.n.1]alkanes are proposed as promising building blocks for piperidine isosteric replacements in drug discovery. Efficient protocols for the preparation of the title compounds are developed, and the impact of fluorination on the physicochemical properties (pKa(H) and LogP) is established for the 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane series.







Abstract
An approach to gem&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.n.1]alkane&#8208; derived building blocks through double&#8208;Mannich addition&#8211; deoxofluorination sequence is described. The scope of the method was demonstrated for a series of saturated (hetero)cyclic ketones or ketoesters (including five&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered cycloalkane derivatives and N&#8208;, O&#8208;, S&#8208;containing saturated heterocycles). Further transformations of functional groups produced various bifunctionalized difluorinated building blocks, namely, N&#8208;protected aminoacids, mono&#8208;N&#8208;Boc&#8208;protected diamines, and unprotected aminoalcohols in good to excellent overall yields. For the azabicyclo[3.3.1]alkane series, a potential for isosteric replacements is demonstrated by evaluation of the key physicochemical properties (i.&#8201;e., pKa(H) and LogP).

         <title>&#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;Substituted Saturated Bicyclic Amines: Advanced Building Blocks for Medicinal Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous fluorination and rigidification of saturated heterocycles is a promising approach to advanced building blocks for medicinal chemistry, which is illustrated in the presented work by design, multigram synthesis, and physicochemical characterization of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted bicyclic amines. It is shown that application of the above&#8208;mentioned structural modifications has complex effects on the compounds&#8217; physicochemical properties (pKa and LogP) that can be only partially explained by simple additive models.







Abstract
A straightforward approach to &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;substituted saturated bicyclic amines starting from commercially available compounds is proposed. The key steps include addition of the Ruppert&#8208;Prakash reagent to imine moiety and AlMe3&#8208;promoted intramolecular heterocyclization. The reaction sequence provides access to fluorine&#8208;containing azabicyclo[n.2.1]alkane (n=1&#8211;3) or azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivatives in 10&#8211;42&#8201;% overall yield. The physicochemical properties of the prepared compounds or their model derivatives (i.&#8201;e., pKa and LogP) were measured and compared to those for the parent monocyclic or non&#8208;fluorinated saturated heterocycles. As expected, amine basicity was lowered considerably upon introduction of the CF3 group (&#916;pKa&#8776;4), while the lipophilicity increased (by ca. 0.5 LogP units). The summarized data provides a convenient guideline for application of the synthesized compounds in drug discovery programs.

         <title>Synthetic Outer Membrane Vesicles Bearing Tn Antigen</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;thio glycolipids (TGL) are suggested as key components for producing synthetic outer membrane vesicles (S&#8208;OMVs). Using thiol&#8208;ene coupling (TEC) a small library of TGLs was synthesized with good yields. By combining them with POPC, varying&#8208;sized multilamellar giant vesicles (GVs) were formed, advancing the development of anticancer vaccines and drug delivery systems.







Abstract

         <title>Multifunctional coatings hinging on the catechol/amine interplay</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the dopa/lysine rich mussel proteins featuring unique wet adhesive properties, functional coatings based on catechol and amine components represent versatile systems with applications in biomedical and other fields. The adhesive properties hinge on covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions of the catechol/o&#8208;quinone and the amine counterpart as evidenced in both polydopamine and other coatings based on separate catechol and amine components.







Abstract
Design and implementation of functional coatings is a topic of active research in a variety of health&#8208;related applications, most of which require wet adhesion. The powerful wet adhesion of mussel byssus proteins rich in DOPA and lysine residues provided a clue to realize that the combination of a catechol and an amine component has a specific role in the interfacial adhesion. From this natural model, polydopamine (PDA)&#8208;based coatings have been developed that result from the oxidative polymerization of dopamine combining the catechol and amine functionalities in the same molecule. Covalent interactions resulting from Michael&#8208;type addition or Schiff&#8208;base formation of the polymeric products from dopamine oxidation as well as non&#8208;covalent &#960;&#8208;stacking and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions exemplify the diverse mode of catechol/amine interplay that have been identified as responsible of the adhesion and cohesion properties of PDA. In the last decade coatings inspired to the same chemistry but using different starting materials have been explored particularly catechols of natural origin and different amine components, while mechanistic studies with model compounds have allowed to rationalize the structural requirements for adhesion and to expand the potential of these functional coatings.

         <title>Oxidative Cleavage and Ring Reconstruction in the Synthesis of Amaryllidaceae Alkaloid Analogues</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents the synthesis of analogues of bioactive Amaryllidaceae alkaloids that contain a five&#8208;membered ring C and a quaternary carbon centre. The synthesis was carried out in a divergent manner, starting from a common intermediate, keto aldehyde 1a. This intermediate was obtained by oxidative cleavage of a carbocyclic ring present in the previously synthesised tetracyclic compounds. Subsequent closure of a new heterocyclic ring B using different methods led to products with structural cores found in naturally occuring alkaloids such as pretazettine, tazettine or macronine. In addition, an analogue of egonine was prepared from the same intermediate. Our approach thus provides access to multiple structural types of potentially bioactive molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembly of (2&#215;C2+C`2)&#215;n Molecular Complexity Using a Sequence of Pt&#8209; and Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Transformations with Calcium Carbide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing molecular complexity from simple precursors stands as a cornerstone in contemporary organic synthesis. Systems harnessing easily accessible starting materials, which offer control over stereochemistry and support a modular assembly approach, are particularly in demand. In this research, we utilized calcium carbide, presenting a sustainable pathway to generate acetylene gas &#8208;&#160;a fundamental C2 building block. We performed a Pt&#8208;facilitated linkage of two C2&#8208;units sourced from two calcium carbide molecules to craft a conjugated C4 core with exceptional stereoselectivity. As a benchmark, we selected the synthesis of (E,E)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diiodobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene, executing it in a two&#8208;chamber reactor. Compartmentalization of the reactions across these chambers resulted in the desired product in 85% yield. Furthermore, highenergy polymeric substances were derived by marrying the molecular intricacy between (E,E)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diiodobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene and calcium carbide, underpinning a unique C4 + C2 assembly blueprint. The structure and morphology of the polymeric material were characterized by IR and NMR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. Overall, two complementary 2&#215;C2&#8208;to&#8208;C4 and (2&#215;C2+C`2)&#215;n assembly schemes were developed using Pt and Pd catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Carbenic Nature of Nitrile Ylides: Experimental and Computational Characterization of Hydroxy and Amino Nitrile Ylides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrile ylides are 1,3&#8208;dipolar species with structures that are commonly described by propargylic and/or allenic resonance forms. Nevertheless, certain nitrile ylides exhibit a tendency to form dimers, suggesting the existence of structures characterized by an important carbenic contribution. To address the nitrile ylide carbenic nature, here we investigate two derivatives with OH and NH2 electron&#8208;donating substituents. These nitrile ylides were generated in cryogenic matrices by UV&#8208;irradiation of 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208; and 3&#8208;amino&#8208;isoxazole precursors and were found to photoisomerize to the corresponding oxazoles. The IR spectral characterization of the photogenerated nitrile ylides reveals the absence of the characteristic strong &#957;as(CNC) absorption, which is associated with allenic and propargylic type structures. Computed geometries for the two experimentally investigated nitrile ylides and for analogues with different substituents at C3 and C1, together with NBO and NRT electronic structure analyses, performed at the CCSD(T) level of theory, reveal substantial carbenic character exclusively for nitrile ylides bearing OH and NH2 substituents at C3. As a whole, the results shed light on the factors determining the structural features of nitrile ylides, which play a major role in defining the reactivity of these important elusive compounds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In the presence of sparteine 2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylbenzoates were lithiated enantioselectively in order to generate chiral d1 reagents. Their reaction with &#945;&#8208;halo boronic esters, resembling chiral a1 reagents, was explored. Enantiomerically enriched &#945;&#8208;halo boronic esters are readily available by Matteson Homologation (MH).

Generation of the d1 reagent from the corresponding stannane stabilized the protocol and delivered moderate yields for &#946;&#8208;unsubstituted &#945;&#8208;halo boronic esters. Good to excellent yields were obtained for &#946;&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;halo boronic esters, which can be generated by iterative MH, thus establishing this method as a useful terminus for an iterative Matteson sequence.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Hydrolithiation of Guaiazulene: Isolation of Two Isomerically Pure Renewable Feedstock&#8208;Based Cyclopentadienyl Synthons</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present an in&#8208;depth study of hydride transfer or proton abstraction at natural product guaiazulene to form guaiazulenide salts (8&#8208;H&#8208;GuaH)Li 1a and (Gua&#8217;&#8217;)Na(OEt2) 2. Both carbanions were correctly proposed by Hafner et al. but could never be isolated in isomerically, spectroscopically and analytically pure form so far. Therefore, their use as cyclopentadienyl synthons in organometallic chemistry remained essentially unexplored. Here, we present their synthesis and full characterisation including 2D NMR spectroscopy and two XRD structural analyses. 1a is isolated in isomerically and chemically pure form via a catalytic variant of olefin hydrolithiation, the addition of LiH to an activated hydrocarbon C=C double bond catalysed by LiAlH4. This atom economic synthesis of a pure organolithium compound from an olefin, LiH or lithium and dihydrogen, respectively, is without precedence. In a follow up report we will demonstrate, that these valuable ligand salts can be used as cheap sterically demanding renewable feedstock&#8208;based cyclopentadienyl synthons in the synthesis of homo&#8208; and heteroleptic late transition metal complexes and catalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible light photoreductive dearomatizative alkylation of N&#8208;alkyl pyridinium salts for producing 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines is described. The reaction harnesses N&#8208;alkyl pyridinium salts both as the alkyl radical precursors to intiate the reaction and as the 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;based alkylating reagents to terminate the reaction. In contrast to the reported electroreductive procedure via the key dihydropyridine radical intermediates, mechanistic studies demonstrate that this photoreductive dearomatizative alkylation proceeds via directly alkyl radical addition across the pyridinium ring followed by single electron oxidant (SEO) and dearomatization.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report herein an efficient synthesis of 3&#8208;arylbenzothiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;one compounds. First, substituted benzothiazoles can be smoothly oxidized to benzothiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives in the presence of CuCl2&#160;and trifluoroacetic anhydride. Secondly, the Cu2S&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;arylation&#160;of benzothiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;one with arylboronic acids yields a series of novel 3&#8208;aryl benzothiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives. The method provides good yields for a variety of substrates and shows good compatibility with functional groups. The usefulness of the skeleton was further illustrated by the derivatisation of 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;benzothiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;one.&#160;Mechanistic studies suggest that the oxidation of benzothiazole may undergo a free radical reaction process.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoisomerization of Alkenes via Energy Transfer Enabled by Cu&#8208;Acetylide Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper acetylide complexes were found to act as visible photosensitizers for energy transfer to alkenes. On this basis, the E&#8594;Z photoisomerization reactions of alkenes with various functional groups under blue light irradiation were performed with moderate to high selectivity. The mechanistic studies suggested that the reactions involved energy transfer (EnT) from the photo&#8208;excited copper acetylide to the alkene via the singlet excited state.







Abstract
This work demonstrates the isomerization of alkenes enabled by copper&#8208;acetylide complexes under blue light. This system is applicable to the E&#8594;Z isomerization of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;substituted cinnamate derivatives with moderate to excellent Z/E ratios. A reaction pathway involving singlet energy transfer (EnT) from the copper&#8208;acetylide complex to the alkene is proposed.

This system is applicable to the E&#8594;Z isomerization of &#945;- and &#946;-substituted cinnamate derivatives with moderate to excellent Z/E ratios. A reaction pathway involving singlet energy transfer (EnT) from the copper-acetylide complex to the alkene is proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Perfluoro Alkyl/Alkenyl Aryl Sulfide: C&#8208;S Coupling Reaction Using Hexafluoropropylene Dimer (HFPD) as a Building Block</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient approaches to perfluoroalkyl/alkenyl aryl sulfides were accomplished by a C&#8208;S coupling reaction under mild conditions. Hexafluoropropylene dimer was employed as a versatile building block for the perfluoroalkylation and perfluoroalkenylation of thiophenol. The application of the synthetic strategy was demonstrated by the high&#8208;yield transformation of a broad range of aryl derivatives. A plausible mechanistic explanation was proposed to elaborate the differences between the two reaction pathways. The methodology provides straightforward and convenient access to aryl sulfides constituting C6 perfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkenyl substituents.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions of Cyclic Enones and 2,5&#8208;Disubstituted Tetrazoles: An Unprecedented Pathway to Polysubstituted Pyrazolines and Pyrazoles</title>

         <dc:description>
1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of cyclic enones with 2,5&#8208;disubstituted nitrile&#8208;imines obtained by photochemical activation of 2,5&#8208;diaryl substituted tetrazoles leads to the formation of novel pyrazoles and pyrazolines. Reactions can be monitored using UV&#8208;vis absorption and emission measurements.







Abstract
We report herein the syntheses of original pyrazolines and pyrazoles through 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of cyclic enones with 2,5&#8208;disubstituted nitrile imines achieved via photochemical activation of 2,5&#8208;diaryl substituted tetrazoles. Monitoring of the reactions, similar to nitrile imine&#8208;mediated tetrazole&#8208;ene cycloadditions (NITEC), could be performed by means of UV&#8208;vis absorption and emission measurements. The presence or absence of substituents in the alpha position of the ketone function makes it possible to direct these reactions towards the selective formation of pyrazoles or pyrazolines. The choice of the cyclic enones and 2,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazoles proved crucial for the fluorescence properties of the polycyclic derivatives obtained.

         <title>Development of the Meyer&#8211;Schuster Rearrangement on Propargylic Alcohols with Fluorinated Chains</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New enones with mono&#8208;, gem&#8208;difluoro&#8208; or trifluoro chains are easily obtained through the Meyer&#8211;Schuster Rearrangement (MSR), using phosphomolybdic acid as the catalyst selected after extensive screening.







Abstract
The Meyer&#8211;Schuster Rearrangement (MSR) is a challenging process for propargylic alcohols bearing fluorine atom(s) on their chains. Most classical reagents/catalysts failed to perform the MSR but, after extensive screening, we demonstrated that phosphomolybdic acid was the first efficient catalyst for the MSR with such derivatives. The scope and limitations have been studied, affording fluorine&#8208;containing enones as useful intermediates for the synthesis of targets with fluorine(s) on their side chains. It was exemplified by the preparation of a 2&#8208;piperidino&#8208;pyrimidine and a pyrazole.

         <title>Investigation and Characterization of Nitrazapropane&#8208;, Oxapropane&#8208; and Trinitrazaheptane&#8208;Bridged Nitro Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from a modified Bachmann procedure, which is commonly used for the synthesis of RDX and HMX, two new nitro esters were synthesized and investigated, 1,3&#8208;dinitroxy&#8208;2&#8208;nitrazapropane and 1,7&#8208;dinitroxy&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trinitrazaheptane. Furthermore, the structural similar compound 1,3&#8208;dinitroxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxapropane was obtained. All compounds were comprehensivly characterized and compared to commonly used explosives in terms of their physicochemical properties and detonation behavior.







Abstract
In this work, 1,3&#8208;dinitroxy&#8208;2&#8208;nitrazapropane and 1,7&#8208;dinitroxy&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trinitrazaheptane were synthesized and investigated. Starting from hexamine, the open&#8208;chain compounds were prepared by a modified Bachmann procedure which is commonly used for the synthesis of hexogen (RDX) and octogen (HMX). All new compounds were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, vibrational analysis and elemental analysis. Their thermal behavior was studied by differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The sensitivities towards impact (IS) and friction (FS) were determined according to the BAM (Bundesanstalt f&#252;r Materialforschung und &#8208;pr&#252;fung) standard method. Their energetic properties, which were determined from the energies of formation at the CBS&#8208;4&#8197;M level, were calculated using the EXPLO5 computer code. Moreover, 1,3&#8208;dinitroxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxapropane was synthesized and investigated. The various compounds were compared with each other and with the commonly used explosives in terms of their physicochemical properties and detonation behavior.

Their thermal behavior was studied by differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The sensitivities towards impact (IS) and friction (FS) were determined according to the BAM (Bundesanstalt f&#252;r Materialforschung und -pr&#252;fung) standard method. Their energetic properties, which were determined from the energies of formation at the CBS-4&#8197;M level, were calculated using the EXPLO5 computer code. Moreover, 1,3-dinitroxy-2-oxapropane was synthesized and investigated. The various compounds were compared with each other and with the commonly used explosives in terms of their physicochemical properties and detonation behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Propargylic C&#8722;C Bond Formation Using Metal&#8211;Allenylidene Species</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the asymmetric propargylic C&#8722;C bond formation based on the metal&#8211;allenylidene species, which is an excellent electrophile, allowing the effective construction of various tertiary and quaternary stereocenters and the introduction of an alkyne group, through the asymmetric addition of carbon nucleophiles at C&#947; of the metal&#8211;allenylidene species.







Abstract
The alkyne group is the key component of many bioactive molecules and versatile synthetic building block, thus the introduction of which into target molecules has attracted considerable interest from scientists. Moreover, tertiary and quaternary stereocenters are common motifs in natural products and drugs, however, the asymmetric construction of such motifs is one of the challenging tasks due to the steric congestion of multiple stereospecific substituents attached to one carbon. Metal&#8211;allenylidene are an excellent type of electrophilic species. The asymmetric addition of carbon&#8208;nucleophiles at C&#947; of the metal&#8211;allenylidene provides an effective way to construct tertiary and quaternary stereocenters as well as to introduce an alkyne group. In this review, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art asymmetric propargylic C&#8722;C bond formation via metal&#8208;allenylidene generated in&#8197;situ from propargylic alcohol derivatives are presented. Synthetic applications, mechanistic insights are addressed. The challenges and opportunities of this field are also discussed.

         <title>Thiuram Disulfides for the Fast and Efficient Synthesis of Peptide Disulfide Bonds Under Aqueous Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide disulfide bonds were successfully synthesized by disulfiram and thiram oxidation reactions. Moreover, one&#8208;pot regioselective synthesis of two disulfide bonds was achieved by the combination of disulfiram or thiram with trans&#8208;[PtBr2(CN)4]2&#8722; under aqueous conditions.







Abstract
Disulfide bonds play a critical role in the pharmaceutical and biological properties of peptides. In this work, disulfiram and thiram were investigated to synthesize disulfide bonds in peptides. Excellent purities of single disulfide bond&#8208;containing peptides were achieved with a fast reaction rate. Furthermore, one&#8208;pot regioselective synthesis of two disulfide bonds was successfully achieved by the combination of disulfiram or thiram with trans&#8208;[PtBr2(CN)4]2&#8722; under aqueous conditions.

         <title>Perfluoroalkylated Sulfoximines as Analogues of Togni Reagents: The Crucial Role of Fluorine Atoms for the Stability of Hypervalent Iodine Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of both R1 and R2 groups for the stability of the hypervalent form were examined in detail. The presence of at least two fluorine atoms in R1 moiety is crucial for the stability. The cyclic derivatives are promising reagent to deliver the R2 group under electrophilic or radical mechanism.







Abstract
Hypervalent iodine compounds are described with perfluoroalkyl chains and S&#8208;perfluoromethyl sulfoximines as ligands of the halogen. The influence of these groups on the stability of the cyclic structure is studied. The crucial role of the trifluoromethyl chain is clearly highlighted as an efficient ligand for the hypervalency. The structure and the reactivity of the new skeletons are discussed in detail.

         <title>Nickel Metallaphotoredox Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig Amination Reactions: A Perspective on Irradiation Light Wavelength</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an overview of recent advances in Ni&#8208;metallaphotoredox Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination referring to the irradiation light covering ultraviolet, purple, blue, red, and white light as well as solar light.







Abstract
The construction of C&#8722;N bonds is considered one of the most useful reactions in synthetic chemistry due to their widespread presence in pharmaceuticals, natural products, etc. Pd&#8208;catalyzed Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination (BHA) has provided the most efficient method to form (hetero)aryl amines but it required strong base and sophisticated ligands. In comparison, the combination of photocatalysis and nickel chemistry has revolutionized catalytic strategies and is emerging as a quintessence to realize BHA, termed as Ni&#8208;metallaphotoredox BHA. To pursue a universal protocol, diverse photocatalysts were designed and employed in Ni&#8208;metallaphotoredox BHA, and smoothly promoted C&#8722;N bond formations under irradiation of light from ultraviolet to red light, respectively. Note that the matching of photocatalyst and light was critical for success. Therefore, this review mainly focuses on the discussion of Ni&#8208;metallaphotoredox BHA according to the irradiation light's wavelength, covering ultraviolet, purple, blue, red, and white light as well as solar light. We try to find a clue in the relationship of structure&#8208;photophysical behaviors of photocatalysts under the same or different irradiation light. At last, current limitations and potential trends for advancing Ni&#8208;metallaphotoredox BHA are highlighted. We deem that it could encourage chemists to continue designing suitable photocatalyst for C&#8722;N bond formations under sunlight mimicking plants&#8217; photosynthesis.

This was achieved by developing a mild and selective bromination with N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS) in 3&#8208;position of the imidazole ring. This was followed by a Negishi coupling, which we performed with various coupling partners, resulting in a wide range of different combinations, usually unattainable by other approaches and similar coupling reactions. Fluorescence measurements identified beneficial substitution patterns for the future use of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolines in optical applications, such as organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of 4&#8208;Bromoisocoumarins through Brominative Annulation of 2&#8208;Alkynylaryloate Esters Using In Situ Generated Transient Bromoiodane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient in&#8197;situ generated bromoiodane&#8208;promoted brominative annulation of 2&#8208;alkynylaryloate esters towards the synthesis of 4&#8208;bromo isocoumarin derivatives was established under mild conditions.







Abstract
Herein, we report a facile and proficient protocol for the synthesis of 4&#8208;bromoisocoumarins through brominative annulation of 2&#8208;alkynylaryloate esters with in&#8197;situ generated bromoiodane using a simple hypervalent iodine reagent as mild oxidant and potassium bromide as the halogen source. Using this method, a broad range of valuable halogenated isocoumarins can be obtained in excellent yields at room temperature. Also, this reaction takes place in the absence of any metal catalyst and exhibits high functional group tolerance. Besides, the reaction can also be extended to the gram scale, and a catalytic approach was also demonstrated. Additionally, the prepared 4&#8208;bromoisocoumarins were further transformed into important synthetic compounds.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Conversion of Benzyl Alcohols to N&#8208;Protected Anilines and Alkyl Alcohols to Carbamoyl Azides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Without the need for wasteful solvent&#8208;swaps and work&#8208;up operations, an optimized scalable sequence of reactions (up to 83&#8201;%) to replace the hydroxymethyl group of primary alcohols (R=substituted phenyl or alkyl) with valuable nitrogen functionality has been developed in an economical and green fashion.







Abstract
One&#8208;pot, scalable procedures converting benzylic or aliphatic alcohols to various N&#8208;functionalized amines are reported in 38&#8211;83&#8201;% overall yields. These multi&#8208;step conversions are relatively economic and involve the oxidative formation of acid chloride intermediates and the Curtius rearrangement of acyl azides. Notable aspects of economy include: (1) the use of a relatively green solvent (chlorobenzene) that tolerates both ionic and radical reactions, without the need for rigorously dry or O2&#8208;free conditions; (2) the use of minimal amounts of trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA) as a cheap and green chlorinating agent to oxidize the alcohol starting materials and then transform the aldehyde intermediates to acid chlorides under photoirradiation for azide addition; (3) the efficient capture of isocyanate intermediates by alcohol or azide nucleophiles providing N&#8208;protected anilines or N&#8208;protected alkylamines, respectively, the latter of which was employed in the synthesis of an anti&#8208;dementia drug, memantine hydrochloride, over two purification steps.

         <title>DBU&#8208;Catalyzed Benzannulation towards Stilbene and Biaryl Derivatives from Acyclic Amides with Methyl Coumalate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and environmentally friendly reaction with 1H&#8208;benzotriazoleamide and methyl coumalate using DBU as catalyst to obtain arene derivatives in good yields is reported.







Abstract
The DBU&#8208;catalyzed benzylation of 1H&#8208;benzotriazole amides with methyl coumalate is demonstrated for the synthesis of stilbenes and biaryl derivatives. The transformation involves the base&#8208;catalyzed Michael addition of methyl coumalate to the 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclic ring opening decarboxylation aromatization. Furthermore, the novel 2&#8208;phenylnaphthalene derivatives showed potent anti&#8208;proliferative and anti&#8208;invasive activities against H1299 cells.

         <title>Evaluation of Endoplasmic Reticulum Targeting Isoquinol&#8208;Based BODIPY Dyes and Their Properties as Molecular Rotors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new scaffold based on amphipathic boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes capable of localizing within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), their ability to act as molecular rotors and their pH sensitivity is presented.







Abstract
A series of six new isoquinol&#8208;based BODIPY dyes have been synthesized by a two&#8208;step method. Unlike traditional synthetic methods, synthesis did not require the use of oxidizing agents or solvent. Spectroscopic, electrochemical and DFT calculations indicate that the properties associated with the six dyes are very similar with little influence of the meso&#8208;substituents. Viscosity studies identified three of the new dyes having properties of molecular rotors for applications in the detection of changes in cellular viscosity. Incubation of the dyes with the HEK cell line show no toxicity up to 10&#8197;&#956;M over a 72&#8197;h. period. The dyes show the ability to localize within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cells. With two of the dyes showing favorable comparisons to commercially available ER dyes.

         <title>Evans&#8217; Chiral Auxiliary&#8208;Based Asymmetric Synthetic Methodology and Its Modern Extensions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the asymmetric catalysis has made a spurt of progress, the use of chiral auxiliaries remains crucial in asymmetric synthesis due to their reliability, versatility, and predictability of stereochemistry. Up to date, Evans&#8217;&#160;chiral oxazolidinone&#8208;based asymmetric synthetic methodology is still widely used in asymmetric synthesis. More importantly, it turned out to be a fruitful source of inspiration for the development of related asymmetric synthetic methodologies. However, although reviews on the application of Evans&#8217;&#160;asymmetric synthetic methodology in both organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry continually to appear in the literature, a comprehensive review dedicating to the extensions of Evans&#8217; oxazolidinone&#8208;based asymmetric methodology remains elusive. In this review, we summarize the extensions of the Evans asymmetric methodology, which cover: (1) the modification of the chiral oxazolidinone auxiliaries; (2) the extension of the Evans&#8217;&#160;asymmetric aldol reaction from Evans&#8217;&#160;syn&#8208;aldol to other diastereomeric aldol adducts; (3) the extension of the asymmetric reaction types; (4) the extension of chiral imide&#8208;type substrates to N&#8208;alkenyl, N&#8208;allenenyl and N&#8208;alkynyl oxazolidinones; (5) the achiral oxazolidinone&#8208;based asymmetric catalysis; (6) the catalytic transformation of Evans&#8217;&#160;products; and (7) the straightforward &#160;transformations of Evans&#8217;&#160;chiral products to other classes of compounds than the chiral carboxylic acids, esters, alcohols, and Weinreb amides.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
We have disclosed the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free cascade cyclization/dearomatization reaction of aryl phenol&#8208;tethered alkynes with diselenides to afford selenylated spirocyclohexadienones.







Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method is disclosed for the construction of selenylated spirocyclohexadienones via cascade cyclization/dearomatization reaction of aryl phenol&#8208;tethered alkynes with diselenides. The high efficiency of this protocol was demonstrated by room temperature, simple reaction conditions, and the ability to enable a gram&#8208;scale synthesis. The experiment results implied that the dearomatization process proceeded in a radical way.

         <title>Hydroxynitrile Lyase Discovery, Engineering, and Promiscuity towards Asymmetric Synthesis: Recent Progress</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the developments made on different aspects of hydroxynitrile lyases such as new discoveries, immobilization, engineering, and catalytic promiscuity since 2016, with respect to their application in asymmetric synthesis. It summarizes the synthetic potential of the selected hydroxynitrile lyases in biocatalytic stereoselective synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;cyanohydrins, &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols, their substrate scope and enantioselectivity. The catalytic ability of certain HNLs and their mutants toward new and promiscuous transformations are also described.







Abstract
Hydroxynitrile lyases (HNLs) primarily catalyze the stereoselective synthesis of cyanohydrins, but some of them also carry out asymmetric nitroaldol synthesis (Henry reaction). By virtue of the importance of asymmetric C&#8722;C bond formation, and the wide application of chiral cyanohydrins and &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols, HNLs have gained significance in organic synthesis. Over the years new HNLs have been discovered and their synthetic scope are evaluated. Engineering of HNLs has contributed towards increasing not only the catalytic toolbox but also broad substrate selectivity, stereoselectivity, enzyme stability, and application of the enzymes for different transformations other than the conventional ones. This review describes the recent discoveries of diverse hydroxynitrile lyases (HNLs) and the developments to date since 2016, with respect to their biocatalytic applications in the asymmetric synthesis using both natural and promiscuous reactions.

         <dc:description>Several strategies to synthesize desired 1,2,4&#8208;triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate targets have been reported over the years. The most convenient way features the preparation of the precursor triazolopyridine&#8208;N&#8208;oxide via a condensation step between sulfilimines and a nitrile oxide species, followed by a deoxygenation step. This paper presents a detailed work on the synthesis of [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate&#8208;N&#8208;oxide, featuring a synergistic experimental&#8208;theoretical approach. Herein, we report the development of an efficient and straightforward method to prepare ethyl [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate 3&#8208;oxide in continuous flow. The transfer from batch to flow processing resulted in a significant boost in isolated yield (53% vs. 31%) and a decrease in the simultaneous presence of starting materials and product in the reaction media from 4 hours to 3.5 minutes. An in&#8208;depth mechanistic study of the reaction using density functional theory provided a deeper understanding of the whole reaction manifold and key indications on how to further improve the process in flow.</dc:description>

         <title>Directed C&#8208;H Allylation of Aromatic Carboxamides with Allyl Aryl Ethers under Cp*Co(III)&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Cp*Co(III) C&#8722;H allylation of (hetero)arenes with allyl aryl ethers has been developed using an amide as directing group (24 examples). DFT calculations have shed light on the mechanistic course and reactivity pattern, showing that strong electron releasing groups favour the reaction by reducing the activation barrier of the rate&#8208;determining C&#8208;H activation step. However, the steric strain can increase the energy of the migratory insertion step to the point of completely prevent the reaction, as in the case of the 3,5&#8208;dimethylbenzamide The obtained allylated compounds have been transformed into a variety of interesting heterocyclic and carbocyclic structures, such as isoquinolones and isochromanones.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Arylation of Pyridine/Quinoline N&#8208;Oxides with Indoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arylation of pyridines/quinolines to nitrogen&#8208;adjacent position was achieved by SNAr type reaction between pyridine/quinoline N&#8208;oxides and indoles with the help of Tf2O for the generation of highly electrophilic intermediate. The reaction proceeded in a short reaction time, open&#8208;air condition and without the use of any transition metals, affording various coupling products.







Abstract
We achieved metal&#8208;free pyridine arylations via O&#8208;triflated pyridine N&#8208;oxides and N&#8208;alkylated indoles. The reactions proceeded through reactive intermediates, obtained upon treatment of pyridine N&#8208;oxides with Tf2O, which were sufficiently activated for preferentially installing various indoles at the nitrogen&#8208;adjacent positions of pyridine. This protocol features mild conditions, short reaction times, and ease of handling under stirring and air at room temperature. Furthermore, no transition metal is required, which renders our procedure an environmentally benign approach to pyridine arylation.

         <dc:description>Here we demonstrated the formation of monofluoroallenes via copper&#8208;catalyzed defluoroalkylation or defluoroarylation of gem&#8208;difluoroallenes using affordable and readily available Grignard reagents. Additionally, alkyl lithium or alkyl zinc reagents proved successful in these transformations. Under mild conditions, monofluoroallenes can be converted into fluorinated olefinic compounds or non&#8208;fluorinated alkyne compounds. Initial mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction may start with an organocopper reagent and undergo a rapid &#946;&#8208;F elimination step. Although the current enantiomeric excess is low, chiral ligands could facilitate the asymmetric transformation of this reaction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
An efficient cross&#8208;coupling between acylzirconocenes, readily prepared by hydrozirconation/carbonylation of alkenes, and diaryliodonium tetrafluoroborates is reported. This procedure enables the synthesis of a variety of alkyl&#8208;aryl&#8208;ketones upon simple catalysis with copper cyanide without the need of additional ligands and only requires a low pressure of carbon monoxide generated in&#8197;situ, in a two&#8208;chamber reactor, from N&#8208;formylsaccharin.







Abstract
An efficient and unprecedented cross&#8208;coupling between acylzirconocenes, readily available starting materials conveniently prepared by hydrozirconation of alkenes and a subsequent carbonylation with carbon monoxide, and diaryliodonium tetrafluoroborates is reported. This procedure enables the synthesis of a broad variety of alkyl&#8208;aryl&#8208;ketones upon simple catalysis with copper cyanide without the need of additional ligands and only requires a low pressure of carbon monoxide generated in&#8197;situ, in a two&#8208;chamber reactor, from N&#8208;formylsaccharin.

         <dc:description>Nucleoside monophosphates perform various essential functions and serve as second messengers in living systems. Despite the success of nucleotide&#8208;selective probes based on proteins, the creation of synthetic receptors for nucleoside monophosphates remains a challenging task. In this paper, we explore the design of synthetic receptors based on a combination of three recognition motifs. We show that each binding motif contributes to the formation of the host&#8208;guest complexes. The core macrocycle provides recognition of the phosphate residue of the nucleotide, while naphthalimide and the attached cytosine residue participate in the coordination of the nucleobase via &#960;&#8208;&#960; and hydrogen bonding interactions. The presence of cytosine in the receptor structure substantially increases the overall affinity of receptors for nucleotides. A considerable increase (100&#8208;fold) in binding affinities is observed for the tetranucleotide DNA sequences 5'&#8208;GGGG &#8208;3' and 5'&#8208;CCCC&#8208;3', as compared to the previously reported system without the attached cytosine.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation of Mono and Bis&#8208;Hydrazino&#8208;Substituted N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Boranes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroboration of electrophilic azo reagents with NHC&#8208;boranes leads to the formation of NHC complexes of mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;hydrazino boranes with N&#8722;N&#8722;B and N&#8722;N&#8722;B&#8722;N&#8722;N chains. Steric hindrance on the carbene (primarily) and on the azo reagent (somewhat less) is crucial for the reactivity. Bis&#8208;hydrazino borane complexes with two different hydrazine arms could be obtained via sequential additions.







Abstract
We report the formation of NHC complexes of mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;hydrazino boranes with N&#8722;N&#8722;B and N&#8722;N&#8722;B&#8722;N&#8722;N chains via the reaction of NHC&#8208;boranes with electrophilic azo reagents. The influence of steric hindrance on the carbene and on the azo reagent has been shown to be crucial for the reactivity. The hydroboration of dissymmetric azo reagents is regioselective only when the latter is sufficiently electronically twisted. Bis&#8208;hydrazino borane complexes with two different hydrazine arms could be obtained via sequential addition.

         <title>Radical Acylation of Alkenes by NHC&#8208;Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the advances and progress of the acylation of alkenes via NHC&#8208;organocatalysis through radical relay were summarized according to different ways of generation of the key NHC&#8208;bound ketyl&#8208;type radicals. Furthermore, reaction scopes, limitations and mechanisms were discussed based on reaction types and catalytic systems.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed radical&#8208;radical reactions have been proven to be powerful strategies for assembling ketyl&#8208;containing compounds via single electron transfer (SET) pathway under either thermal conditions or photoredox conditions. In this context, acylation of alkenes via radical relay under NHC&#8208;organocatalysis has also opened a new window for the difunctionalization of alkenes to construct valuable molecules in organic synthesis. In this review, the advances and progress of the acylation of alkenes via NHC&#8208;organocatalysis were summarized according to different ways of generation of the key NHC&#8208;bound ketyl&#8208;type radicals. Furthermore, reaction scopes, limitations and mechanisms were discussed based on reaction types and catalytic systems. Conclusions and perspectives were also put forward at the end.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Triggered Reactions for the Synthesis of Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme&#8208;triggered reactions allow for the synthesis of complex compounds from simple starting material. The examples highlighted in this review showcase the synthetic power of designing smart substrates for enzyme&#8208;triggered reactions and their application for the preparation of structurally complex three&#8208;dimensional small molecules.







Abstract
The application of enzymes for the synthesis of valuable bioactive molecules, synthetic building blocks, fine chemicals and natural products is now well&#8208;established. Biocatalysis has been embraced by industry for the preparation of both bulk chemicals and active pharmaceutical ingredients, where high activity and selectivity can be achieved with low environmental impact. In most cases, biocatalytic transformations involve functional group interconversions, such as redox and amination reactions, but do not lead to significant complexity generation in the molecule. This review explores the less prevalent enzyme&#8208;triggered reactions, where the enzymatic transformation triggers a subsequent spontaneous reaction inter/intramolecularly. The examples highlighted in this review showcase the synthetic power of designing smart substrates for enzyme&#8208;triggered reactions and their application for the preparation of structurally complex three&#8208;dimensional small molecules.

         <title>Two anti&#8208;Prelog NAD&#8208;Dependent Alcohol Dehydrogenases with Broad Substrate Scope and Excellent Enantioselectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cm&#8208;ADH and Pf&#8208;ADH, two NAD&#8208;dependent anti&#8208;Prelog alcohol dehydrogenases, exhibited broad substrate scope comprising linear&#8208;chain, branched&#8208;chain and cyclic alkyl ketones, as well as aryl&#8208;aliphatic, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated and heteroaromatic ketones. Enantiomeric excess of &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee was achieved in most cases. Scale&#8208;up with Pf&#8208;ADH was also conducted. This study contributes to filling a gap in biocatalytic asymmetric synthesis of anti&#8208;Prelog chiral alcohols.







Abstract
Enantiomerically pure alcohols are important to produce active pharmaceutical ingredients, agrochemicals and fine chemicals. Herein, we explored the substrate scope and chemo&#8208; and enantioselectivity of two NAD&#8208;dependent anti&#8208;Prelog alcohol dehydrogenases from Candida maris (Cm&#8208;ADH) and Pichia finlandica (Pf&#8208;ADH) in the asymmetric reduction of ketones. The ADHs were tested for the reduction of acetophenone with NADH that was recycled using a formate dehydrogenase and sodium formate. Cm&#8208;ADH and Pf&#8208;ADH performed best at 30&#8201;&#176;C and at around pH&#8197;7 and pH&#8197;6, respectively. Pf&#8208;ADH operated well at 50&#8197;mM acetophenone concentration, while Cm&#8208;ADH was limited to 10&#8197;mM. Regarding the substrate scope, linear&#8208;chain alkyl ketones were efficiently reduced (up to 98&#8201;% conversion), while branched and cyclic ketones gave lower conversions (up to 60&#8201;%). Aryl&#8208;aliphatic ketones showed variable levels of conversion (&lt;1&#8211;79&#8201;%), while &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated and heteroaromatic ketones exhibited good to excellent conversions. In most of the cases, the enantiomeric excess was &gt;99&#8201;%. Aliphatic and aryl&#8208;aliphatic aldehydes were converted with up to &gt;99&#8201;% conversion. A scale&#8208;up experiment with Pf&#8208;ADH using acetophenone as substrate led to 73&#8201;% isolated yield and &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee (R).
This work contributes to filling the gap in biocatalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral alcohols by introducing two NAD&#8208;dependent ADHs with anti&#8208;Prelog selectivity.

     alt="Two anti-Prelog NAD-Dependent Alcohol Dehydrogenases with Broad Substrate Scope and Excellent Enantioselectivity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cm-ADH and Pf-ADH, two NAD-dependent anti-Prelog alcohol dehydrogenases, exhibited broad substrate scope comprising linear-chain, branched-chain and cyclic alkyl ketones, as well as aryl-aliphatic, &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated and heteroaromatic ketones. Enantiomeric excess of &amp;gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;&lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt; was achieved in most cases. Scale-up with Pf-ADH was also conducted. This study contributes to filling a gap in biocatalytic asymmetric synthesis of anti-Prelog chiral alcohols.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enantiomerically pure alcohols are important to produce active pharmaceutical ingredients, agrochemicals and fine chemicals. Herein, we explored the substrate scope and chemo- and enantioselectivity of two NAD-dependent anti-Prelog alcohol dehydrogenases from &lt;i&gt;Candida maris&lt;/i&gt; (Cm-ADH) and &lt;i&gt;Pichia finlandica&lt;/i&gt; (Pf-ADH) in the asymmetric reduction of ketones. The ADHs were tested for the reduction of acetophenone with NADH that was recycled using a formate dehydrogenase and sodium formate. Cm-ADH and Pf-ADH performed best at 30&#8201;&#176;C and at around pH&#8197;7 and pH&#8197;6, respectively. Pf-ADH operated well at 50&#8197;mM acetophenone concentration, while Cm-ADH was limited to 10&#8197;mM. Regarding the substrate scope, linear-chain alkyl ketones were efficiently reduced (up to 98&#8201;% conversion), while branched and cyclic ketones gave lower conversions (up to 60&#8201;%).

         <title>Probing the Impact of Added Al(OTf)3 on DalPhos/Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Arylations of Amides with (Hetero)aryl Chlorides</title>

The potential activating effect of added aluminium triflate (5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) on the (DalPhos)Ni(aryl)Cl&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of primary amides with (hetero)aryl chlorides is examined.







Abstract
We disclose herein our study examining the potential activating effect of added aluminum triflate (5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) on the (DalPhos)Ni(aryl)Cl (1&#8197;mol&#8201;% Ni) catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of primary amides with (hetero)aryl chlorides. In some instances, dramatically improved conversion to product was achieved by use of added aluminum triflate; with furfurylamine catalytic inhibition occurred. The reaction outcome appears to result from the interplay of DalPhos ligand and aryl group within the Ni pre&#8208;catalyst, as well as the identity of the cross&#8208;coupling partners.

         <title>Bifunctional Iodoazolium Salts: Searching for Cooperation Between Halogen Bonding and Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;covalent interactions play an important role in all sub&#8208;fields of chemistry, including catalysis, where interactions of different natures can work together to improve reactivities and selectivities. Several families of molecules that incorporate both hydrogen bond (HB) and halogen bonding (XB) donors have already been studied. However, there is a lack of data on how grafting HB donors to iodoazolium salts could impact their association and reactivity properties. Herein, we disclose the synthesis of a library of iodoazolium salts bearing varied HB donors, along with a study of their physico&#8208;chemical properties using different techniques (X&#8208;ray diffraction, 31P NMR, ITC) and their behavior in catalysis. Even though no clear&#8208;cut evidence of cooperation between XB and HB could be obtained through physico&#8208;chemical evaluations, a iodoazolium salt bearing a urea function displayed better conversion and product selectivity in a Ritter reaction than all other activators lacking one or the other function.</dc:description>

         <title>Base Promoted Synthesis of 4&#8208;Quinolones Fused with Medium&#8208;Sized Rings</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and simple protocol for the synthesis of 4&#8208;quinolone derivatives via base&#8208;promoted carbon&#8208;carbon &#963;&#8208;bond cleavage reaction of cyclic &#946;&#8208;ketoesters under mild reaction conditions has been developed.







Abstract
In the presence of cesium carbonate, ynones bearing an ortho&#8208;amino group reacted with cyclic &#946;&#8208;ketoesters through conjugated addition/carbon&#8208;carbon &#963;&#8208;bond cleavage/nucleophilic aromatic substitution tandem reaction to obtain 4&#8208;quinolones fused with medium&#8208;sized rings in good yields. This is the first example of synthesis of 4&#8208;quinolones through base&#8208;promoted insertion reactions of carbon&#8208;carbon triple bonds into carbon&#8208;carbon &#963;&#8208;bonds. Notable features of this program are mild and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free reaction conditions.

         <title>Synthesis of Penta&#8208; and Tetrasubstituted Quercetins and Their Fluorescent Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quercetin contains five hydroxy groups (OH) at positions 3, 5, 7, 3', and 4'. The selective reaction of a hydroxy group in quercetin is an important strategy for the modulation of various properties of the derivatives. Herein, we report the synthesis of selective quercetin derivatives, wherein the oligoether chains were linked to the hydroxyl groups. Interestingly, the penta&#8208;substituted quercetin derivative exhibited a higher fluorescence intensity than the tetra&#8208;substituted one. The fluorescence behavior of synthetic derivatives was investigated using solvatochromism, molecular aggregations, computational calculations, and hydrogen bonds with solvents. The fluorescent penta&#8208;substituted quercetin derivative did not show any cytotoxicity up to 600 &#181;M concentration, showing a novel biocompatible fluorescent molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Reaction Mechanism and Origin of Stereoselectivity in the Fluorination and Trifluoromethylthiolation of 2&#8208;Bromoamides with AgF and AgSCF3</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactions of chiral &#945;&#8208;bromoamides with AgF readily gave the corresponding 2&#8208;fluorinated amide with retention of configuration. The mechanism and origin of the stereochemistry were rationalised using density functional theory calculations, which suggested a double&#8208;inversion pathway via the formation of an aziridinone intermediate. The computed reaction pathway is consistent with the experimental results. In addition, the stereochemistry in base&#8208;promoted trifluoromethylthiolation of &#945;&#8208;bromoamides using AgSCF3 was examined. The experimental results showed that the reaction proceeds through the generation of a neutral aziridinone intermediate, following the attack of a trifluoromethylthiolate anion at C&#8208;3. The stereoselectivity of C&#8208;3 attack on the aziridinone depended on the steric bulk of substitutes on the &#945;&#8208;position and nitrogen of the amide. The study results show the potential utility of AgF and AgSCF3 in the synthesis of chiral 2&#8208;functionalized amide derivatives and provide mechanistic insights for nucleophilic substitution of 2&#8208;bromoamides.</dc:description>

The mechanism and origin of the stereochemistry were rationalised using density functional theory calculations, which suggested a double-inversion pathway via the formation of an aziridinone intermediate. The computed reaction pathway is consistent with the experimental results. In addition, the stereochemistry in base-promoted trifluoromethylthiolation of &#945;-bromoamides using AgSCF3 was examined. The experimental results showed that the reaction proceeds through the generation of a neutral aziridinone intermediate, following the attack of a trifluoromethylthiolate anion at C-3. The stereoselectivity of C-3 attack on the aziridinone depended on the steric bulk of substitutes on the &#945;-position and nitrogen of the amide. The study results show the potential utility of AgF and AgSCF3 in the synthesis of chiral 2-functionalized amide derivatives and provide mechanistic insights for nucleophilic substitution of 2-bromoamides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanism of Borane&#8208;Catalyzed Oligomerization of Arylallenes and Arylacetylenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, it was shown that Piers&#8217; borane [HB(C6F5)2]2 can induce rapid oligomerization reactions of arylacetylenes and arylallenes. Using phenylallene PhCH=C=CH2 and phenylacetylene PhC&#8801;CH as typical substrates, the detailed mechanisms of borane&#8208;induced oligomerization are disclosed by extensive state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art DFT calculations. Following initial regio&#8208;selective hydroboration of unsaturated C=C or C&#8801;C bonds, further oligomerization and structural rearrangement reactions may occur via unique boryl&#8208;enabled conversions such as 1,3&#8208;boryl&#8208;shift, allylboration, 1,2&#8208;carboboration, and 1,5&#8208;electrocyclization. Together with stepwise transborylation with hydroboranes such as pinacolborane HBpin, such fundamental reactions may pave a catalytic way to borane&#8208;induced oligomerization of arylacetylenes and arylallenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Studies on the Tropylium&#8208;Catalyzed Carboxylic Acid O&#8208;H Insertion with Diazoesters: The Role of Homoaromaticity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A tropylium&#8208;catalyzed carboxylic acid O&#8208;H insertion with diazoesters was reported to provide &#945;&#8208;hydroxy esters through an activated carbene intermediate. This study presents a revised mechanism based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations involving a unique homoaromatic intermediate formed between the tropylium ion and the diazoester. The calculated energies of the intermediates and transition states support this revised mechanism. Our computational model explains the tropylium ion's binding to the diazoester, resulting in the homoaromatic intermediate. By comparing the reaction profiles of four different pathways, our findings contribute to a better understanding of the reaction mechanism and have potential implications for designing more efficient catalytic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Highly Substituted Pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;diones through Ag(I) Catalyzed Cyclization of 4&#8208;Hydroxyquinolinyl&#8208;2&#8208;ynones</title>

         <dc:description>
Ag(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of 4&#8208;Hydroxyquinolinyl&#8208;2&#8208;ynones afforded pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;diones in excellent yields. The core of these compounds is formed by fusion of quinolone and pyrrolone moieties, and the method gives easy access to a new class of therapeutically relevant compounds for anticancer and antibacterial drug discovery efforts.







Abstract
An efficient synthetic route to access highly substituted pyrrolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;diones in which the core is formed by fusion of quinolone and pyrrolone moieties is discussed. The method involves Ag(I) catalyzed cyclization of 4&#8208;Hydroxyquinolinyl&#8208;2&#8208;ynones which in turn may be accessed from kynurenic acid derivatives through Weinreb amide intermediate, followed by alkyne addition. Studies involving substrates with different substitution pattern revealed that factors increasing the nucleophilicity of quinoline nitrogen or Lewis acid&#8208;coordination of the ynone unit gives high yields in short reaction times. It was possible to execute tandem cyclization&#8208;arylation sequence by using Pd(II) generated by oxidative addition of Pd(0) with aryl iodide as the electrophilic species to get substitution pattern as seen in Discoipyrrole A.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The defective wheel&#8208;shaped nanographdiynes incorporating butadiyne&#8208;bridged metacyclophanes with para&#8208;bis(phenylbutadiynyl)&#8208;benzene units as the axis were synthesized to study the structure and properties of GDY with defects. The optical properties of these graphdiyne substructures can be tuned through the variation of &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension and quantity of the para axis, especially the fusion of adjacent dehydrobenzo [18] annulenes.







Abstract
The synthesis and optical properties of wheel&#8208;shaped nanographdiynes that has lost some butadiyne spokes were reported. These defective wheel&#8208;shaped nanographdiynes possess butadiyne&#8208;bridged metacyclophanes with para&#8208;bis(phenylbutadiynyl)&#8208;benzene units as the axis. The optimized geometries of the defective wheel&#8208;shaped nanographdiynes along with their vibrational spectra, HOMO and LUMO orbitals were calculated at B3LYP/6&#8208;311G(d,p) level. HOMO and LUMO orbitals are delocalized mainly over the para&#8208;bis(phenylbutadiynyl)&#8208;benzene axis, with weak contribution from the attached ethynyl units. The &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension and quantity increase of the para axis influenced the optical properties of these graphdiyne substructures, leading to the change of bandgap from 2.88&#8197;eV to 2.56&#8197;eV as reflected by optical spectroscopy. The defective wheel&#8208;shaped nanographdiynes lost the characteristic intensive sharp absorption peak at low energy region, which indicated that the fusion of adjacent dehydrobenzo [18] annulenes are crucial for the bulk properties of graphdiyne.

         <title>Photoinduced Single&#8208;Electron Reduction of Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkenes serve as versatile building blocks in organic synthesis. However, the challenge of achieving single&#8208;electron reduction of alkenes persists. In recent years, photocatalysis has emerged as a promising and efficient tool for accomplishing the single&#8208;electron reduction of alkenes. Given the potential benefits that can be derived from photoinduced single&#8208;electron reduction of alkenes, including the development of potent catalytic systems to enable diverse alkene difunctionalization reactions, it is necessary to provide a conceptual understanding of this emerging field. Hence, we present an overview of current synthetic techniques for photoinduced single&#8208;electron reduction of alkenes.</dc:description>

An operationally simple protocol for the &#945;&#8208;thio/selenocyanation of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters and oxindoles by using NaSCN or KSeCN under oxidative Umpolung conditions has been successfully implemented.







Abstract
We herein report a protocol for the &#945;&#8208;thio&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;seleno&#8208;cyanation of different cyclic &#946;&#8208;ketoesters and oxindoles by using NaSCN or KSeCN as easily accessible inorganic nucleophilic S(e)CN sources under oxidative conditions. Key to success for both transformations is the use of dibenzoylperoxide as an oxidant allowing for the coupling of two inherently nucleophilic species under operationally simple conditions in high yields and with broad functional group tolerance.

         <title>Exhaustive Reduction of Esters, Carboxylic Acids and Carbamates to Methyl Groups Catalyzed by Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multi&#8208;step reduction of carboxy groups to methyl groups commonly used in organic synthesis is simplified by a new metal&#8208;free catalyst system. It uses boronic acids to catalyze the single&#8208;step reduction of esters, carboxylic acids and carbamates to methyl groups. High&#8208;yield, multifunctional product formation is achieved under mild conditions using ammonia borane as the hydrogen donor.







Abstract
Carboxy to methyl reduction is an important transformation in organic synthesis, yet existing methodologies often require multi&#8208;step procedures or use hazardous metal hydrides. Herein, a metal&#8208;free catalytic system is reported for the one&#8208;step reduction of esters, carboxylic acids, and carbamates to a methyl group, in the presence of catalytic amounts of boronic acids. By using ammonia borane as a hydrogen donor, a wide range of products bearing different functional groups can be obtained in high yields under relatively mild conditions. Mechanistic studies and control experiments elucidate the complexity of the mechanism and provide an explanation for the observed selectivity.

A phosphine&#8208;catalyzed (3+2) annulation of Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman carbonates with pyrazolinone&#8208;derived ketimines has been achieved to give various spirodihydropyrrole&#8208;dihydropyrazolones in moderate to high yields with good diastereoselectivities. The reaction tolerated diverse MBH carbonates and ketimines. Both scale&#8208;up reaction and further transformation of the product were successfully performed. In addition, up to 98&#8201;% ee of chiral product was obtained with the use of chiral bifunctional phosphine.

The reaction tolerated diverse MBH carbonates and ketimines. Both scale-up reaction and further transformation of the product were successfully performed. In addition, up to 98&#8201;% ee of chiral product was obtained with the use of chiral bifunctional phosphine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>5&#8208;N,N&#8208;Diarylaminothiazoles with Electron&#8208;Accepting Groups: Synthesis, Photophysical Properties, and Their Application for the Detection of Hydrazine Hydrate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>5&#8208;N,N&#8208;Diarylaminothiazoles containing cyano and nitro groups were synthesized using the Pd&#8208;catalyzed Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination reaction with good yields. The cyano group in the resultant thiazole was reduced to a formyl group. This was then subjected to the Knoevenagel condensation reaction, leading to the formation of a thiazole with a dicyanovinyl group. The nitro group in the thiazole was reduced to an amino group, which was subsequently reacted with triphosgene, yielding a thiazole with an isocyanate group. These thiazoles, with their electron&#8208;accepting properties, demonstrated absorption and emission spectra at longer wavelengths. Notably, the thiazole containing the dicyanovinyl group displayed a red emission. Tests for the detection of hydrazine hydrate, a hazardous volatile organic compound, were conducted using the synthesized thiazoles. The results showed that the dicyanovinyl group effectively responded to hydrazine hydrate, evidenced by changes in the emission spectra.&#160;This change in color was also visibly detectable to the naked eye.</dc:description>

A copper&#8208;catalyzed &#945;,&#946;&#8208;regioselective (2+4) cycloaddition of propargylic esters with o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl substituted secondary phosphine oxides (SPOs) was established, which afforded phosphorus&#8208;containing six&#8208;membered heterocycles in high yields.

         <dc:description>2&#8208;Hydroxypyridines have emerged as versatile nucleophiles in organic synthesis. The N&#8208; and O&#8208;functionalization of 2&#8208;hydroxypyridines affords straightforward and practical methods for the construction of N&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;pyridones and O&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;hydroxypyridines, which are important structural motifs in numerous natural products, pharmaceuticals and biologically active compounds. Nonetheless, the competition between N&#8208; and O&#8208;functionalization of 2&#8208;hydroxypyridines presents an inevitable and formidable challenge. In the past few decades, chemoselective N&#8208; and/or O&#8208;functionalization of 2&#8208;hydroxypyridines has received extensive attention from the synthetic community, resulting in the development of elegant and effective strategies to address this chemoselectivity.

         <title>The Total Synthesis of Aspidofractinine and Related Alkaloids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fascinating structural features and potential biological activities of aspidofractinine monoterpenoid indole alkaloids grasped the attention of the synthetic community since 1964. Aspidofractinine also serves as the primary structural component to over 200 monoterpenoid indole alkaloids, in which most of these alkaloids' total synthesis has been unexplored. In light of these facts, studies on the synthetic strategies towards the complex, intriguing carbon skeleton of aspidofractinine have high implications. The intensive studies on the total synthesis of aspidofractinine alkaloids have resulted in numerous elegant strategies to construct the highly substituted hexacyclic core structure containing bicyclo[2.2.2]octane motif and three all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereogenic centers. This review discusses all reported strategies for synthesizing aspidofractinine, and aspidofractinine&#8208;like alkaloids.</dc:description>

         <title>28&#960; Non&#8208;Fused Hexaphyrin: Synthesis, Protonation Triggered M&#246;bius Aromaticity and Structural Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a 28&#960; non&#8208;fused core&#8208;modified E&#8208;hexaphyrin is reported. An interesting transformation was observed, wherein the initially non&#8208;aromatic structure of the macrocycle was converted into an aromatic structure through the introduction of a proton to the imine nitrogen atoms.







Abstract
Synthesis of core&#8208;modified 28&#960; non&#8208;fused hexaphyrin is reported. The optical and 1H&#8197;NMR spectral analysis reveals the non&#8208;aromatic nature of the macrocycle in its freebase form at 298&#8197;K. However, the non&#8208;aromatic nature of the macrocycle remains unaltered upon lowering the temperature. The structural elucidations for the freebase macrocycle also justify the non&#8208;aromaticity of the freebase 8, where the thiophene units of the 1,2 diphenyl 1,2 dithienyl ethene moiety is deviated maximum from the overall macrocyclic framework. Protonation on the imino pyrrolic nitrogens results in single&#8211;crystal X&#8208;ray structures of 8 which show essential distortion in macrocyclic framework needed for the effective &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, attaining M&#246;bius aromaticity. The Nucleus Independent Chemical Shift (NICS) values for the freebase and protonated macrocycles are &#8722;2.0&#8197;ppm and &#8722;5.6&#8197;ppm. The Anisotropy Induced Current density shows the clockwise delocalization of current density vectors. Overall, the spectral, structural and theoretical analysis suggests nonaromatic in freebase and M&#246;bius aromatic nature of the protonated hexaphyrin.

         <title>A New Strategy for the Preparation of 3&#8208;Amino&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxypyrrolidinone&#8208;4&#8208;acetic Acid, an Unusual &#947;&#8208;Amino Acid found in Microsclerodermins</title>

         <dc:description>
3&#8208;Amino&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxypyrrolidinone&#8208;4&#8208;acetic acid appears in the structures of the microsclerodermin natural product family and represents a challenging synthetic target, due to the ease with which it can dehydrate. We describe a successful strategy for the creation of this unusual &#947;&#8208;amino acid in a model dipeptide, through liberation of a ketone from a dithiolane precursor followed by facile cyclization in mild conditions.







Abstract
An original synthetic strategy is presented for the preparation of the sensitive 3&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxypyrrolidinone&#8208;4&#8208;acetic acid residue that is present in the structures of the microsclerodermin natural product family. The approach relies on the use of a linear &#947;&#8208;amino acid surrogate, derived from asparagine, bearing a &#946;&#8208;dithiolanyl group. A protected dipeptide model system is used to demonstrate that selective removal of the dithioketal protection followed by cyclization gives the target structure in single diastereoisomer form and with little or no dehydration.

         <title>An Intramolecular Enyne Metathesis Approach for the Synthesis of Cyclic 3&#8208;Substituted Unsaturated Sulfones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ring closing enyne metathesis for the synthesis of a series of unsaturated cyclic sulfones is described. The reaction proceeds most effectively with the N&#8208;heterocyclic ruthenium carbene catalysts and the rate of reaction depends on the identity of the alkynyl substituent.







Abstract
Studies into the ring&#8208;closing enyne metathesis of a series of nine sulfone containing enynes is described. The readily accessible sulfone substrates were shown to undergo cyclisation to form 3&#8208;subsituted 2,5&#8208;dihydrothiophene 1,1&#8208;dioxides (sulfolenes) and one 3,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;thiopyran 1,1&#8208;dioxide. The success of this process depended on the substrate's substitution pattern. Moderate to good yields of the products were obtained when the ene component was monosubstituted and it was found that the reactions proceeded most efficiently using the 2nd generation Grubbs catalysts, at elevated temperatures.

         <dc:description>
A novel acyl group: 5&#8208;ammonium&#8208;4,4&#8208;dimethylvaleryl (Amv) group was developed. Amv group was generated by conversion of acryloyl group through decatungstate&#8208;catalyzed addition of C(sp3)&#8722;H bond of i&#8208;BuNH2&#8901;HCl under the irradiation of UV light and can be removed by the treatment with a base. Based on this method, the selective removal of acryloyl groups through Amv groups in the presence of another acetyl or benzoyl group was demonstrated.







Abstract
The 5&#8208;ammonium&#8208;4,4&#8208;dimethylvaleryl (Amv) group was generated by conversion of acryloyl group through decatungstate&#8208;catalyzed addition of C(sp3)&#8722;H bond of i&#8208;BuNH2&#8901;HCl under the irradiation of UV light (365&#8197;nm or 405&#8197;nm). Treatment of Amv&#8208;protected alcohols and anilines with aqueous Na2CO3 promoted the efficient deprotection of Amv. This is a unique method for the efficient removal of acryloyl groups from phenols, alcohols, and anilines. The selective removal of acryloyl groups through Amv in the presence of another acetyl or benzoyl group was demonstrated. The base&#8208;triggered intramolecular cyclization of Amv was monitored by the release of a fluorescent molecule, and it was found that cyclization by Na2CO3 was very rapid (within 1&#8197;min) and that some weak bases such as 2,6&#8208;lutidine are sufficient to promote cyclization.

         <title>Hybrid Steroid&#8208;[60]Fullerene as n&#8208;Type Material for Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fullerene derivatives have been used as electron acceptor and transport materials in organic photovoltaics as well as in perovskite solar cells. Among them, [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) has been one of the most widely used, in combination with poly&#8208;3&#8208;hexylthiophene (P3HT) as an electron donor semiconducting polymer, for the fabrication of organic bulk heterojunction solar cells. In this work, a steroid&#8208;fullerene hybrid was synthesized through the Bingel&#8211;Hirsch reaction to compare its properties with PC61BM as the reference structure. Different analytical, spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques were employed to characterize the new fullerene derivative. The characterization was completed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which explore the hybrid's morphology in aqueous solution, where the presence of the steroid moiety increases the solubility of the fullerene material. DFT/PBE&#8208;D3(BJ)/6&#8208;311G(d,p) calculations for both the steroid&#8208;fullerene hybrid and PC61BM allowed to obtain geometry optimizations and electronic structure data. A comparative study to analyze the nature of the electronic properties of the synthesized steroid&#8208;[60]fullerene hybrid and PC61BM with an oligomer of ten thiophene units, used in the active layer of organic solar cells, was carried out. Electron density maps using the [CIS|CNDOL/21] approach illustrate the photoexcitation of the donor followed by an electron&#8208;charge transfer to the acceptor fullerene.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Catalysed Synthesis of Benzofused Five&#8208;Membered N/O/S&#8208;Heterocycles, a Progressive Area in Synthetic Organic Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;catalysed synthesis of benzo&#8208;fused five&#8208;membered N/O/S heterocyclic compounds such as indole, benzofuran, and benzothiophene, and their well&#8208;established synthetic pathways are reviewed.







Abstract
Benzo&#8208;fused five&#8208;membered N/O/S heterocyclic compounds, such as indole, benzofuran, and benzothiophene, possessing a single heteroatom, have important applications in medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, and material chemistry. Metal&#8208;catalysed reactions are well&#8208;established synthetic pathways for the formation of C&#8722;X bonds, enabling the direct synthesis of heterocycles. This approach offers advantages over traditional methods, such as fewer steps, increased atom economy, low catalyst loading, regioselectivity, and stereoselectivity. Due to their widespread use in the pharmaceutical industry, the formation of C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, and C&#8722;S bonds has gained significant attention. This article focusses on the metal&#8208;catalysed synthesis and corresponding mechanistic approaches for N/O/S&#8208;heterocycles, particularly indole, benzofuran, and benzothiophene, reviewing the progress of the past five years and discussing unexplored future opportunities.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Pantolactone: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the asymmetric synthesis of pantolactone are reviewed and the advantages and disadvantages of common synthetic strategies are highlighted. Among these strategies, direct asymmetric catalysis using small organic molecules as catalysts is an extremely promising approach for the industrial synthesis of D&#8208;pantolactone owing to its high step&#8208;economy, commercially available starting materials, avoidance of toxic reagents, mild reaction conditions, and convenient operation. This review offers valuable insights and recommendations for the design and synthesis of enantioenriched pantolactone and its analogs, providing new and useful guidance in the field.







Abstract
(R)&#8208;Pantolactone, an intermediate in the syntheses of Vitamin B5 and coenzyme A, is an important chiral molecule often used as a food additive, chiral auxiliary, and chiral starting material for organic transformations. Enantioenriched pantolactones are predominantly produced by biological fermentation and chemical synthesis approaches. Herein, we present a review of recent developments in the asymmetric synthesis of pantolactone through different methods, and systematically summarize the characteristics and advantageous features of these strategies. Among the strategies discussed herein, the direct asymmetric catalysis of glyoxylate and isobutyraldehyde with small organocatalyst molecules has attracted growing attention owing to its good step&#8208;economy, commercially available starting materials, absence of toxic reagents, mild reaction conditions, convenient operation, and low catalyst loading. These characteristics render the direct asymmetric route to pantolactone a particularly attractive procedure. This review provides valuable guidance for the design and synthesis of enantioenriched pantolactone and its analogs.

     alt="Asymmetric Synthesis of Pantolactone: Recent Advances"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in the asymmetric synthesis of pantolactone are reviewed and the advantages and disadvantages of common synthetic strategies are highlighted. Among these strategies, direct asymmetric catalysis using small organic molecules as catalysts is an extremely promising approach for the industrial synthesis of D-pantolactone owing to its high step-economy, commercially available starting materials, avoidance of toxic reagents, mild reaction conditions, and convenient operation. This review offers valuable insights and recommendations for the design and synthesis of enantioenriched pantolactone and its analogs, providing new and useful guidance in the field.

         <dc:description>A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed annulation of o&#8208;phenylenediamines and internal alkynes for the synthesis of quinoxalines is developed. This method provides a variety of quinoxalines in good to high yields under a simple and mild reaction conditions with molecular O2 as a terminal oxidant. Preliminary mechanistic studies show that a novel reaction mechanism is involved in the current reaction, which is different from the previous reported dicarbonyl compound mechanism via the oxidation of the alkyne.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Combination Approach in Pd Catalyzed Direct C&#8208;H Arylation of Benzothiazole and Benzoxazole</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate the use of ligand combination approach in the Pd catalyzed direct C&#8208;H arylation of benzothiazole and benzoxazole. The combination of two ligands phenanthroline monohydrate (Phen.H2O) and triphenylphosphine (PPh3) with Pd&#8208;catalyst have offered the best catalytic properties in the C&#8208;H bond arylation reactions than either of two ligands employed separately in the reactions. This protocol exhibits a wide substrate scope affording C2 arylated benzothiazole and benzoxazole derivatives in excellent yields. Mechanistic studies including kinetic isotope effect (KIE), H/D exchange and competition experiments show that the C&#8208;H bond activation of benzothiazole/benzoxazole is very facile under reaction conditions. Furthermore, different mechanistic pathways originated from the catalytically active species such as Pd(&#951;2&#8208;dba)L (dba = dibenzylidene acetone) and Pd(PPh3)2 were investigated using computational methods. The computational results suggest that the generation of catalytically active species from Pd2(dba)3 is endoergic process and Phen ligand can initiate this step. On the other hand, the presence of PPh3 could be crucial for the oxidative addition of aryl halides which is the rate&#8208;determining step of the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Responsive Spiroborate&#8208;Based Assemblies of Podand&#8208;type Ligands Functionalized with Two Terminal/Peripheral Catecholate Moieties in the Presence of Alkali Cations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of two ligands bearing two terminal catecholate binding sites connected by an oligo(ethyleneglycol) bridge of two distinct lengths and their self&#8208;assembly upon boron coordination and alkali cation binding (M = Li, Na, K, Cs) are reported. Attempts to synthesize positional isomers of the ligands are also described. Binding of the four alkali cations M+ through M&#8208;O interactions was studied depending on the length of the oligo(ethyleneglycol) chain in solution by 1H and DOSY NMR, Mass spectrometry (MS) and in the solid&#8208;state by X&#8208;Ray diffraction (XRD) on single crystals. MS spectrometry as well as 1H NMR revealed the presence of monomeric and oligomeric spiroborate compounds. Two monomeric macrocycles could be characterized by XRD, entrapping either lithium or cesium cations within the spiroborate macrocycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Meta&#8208;Ortho Effect on the Excited State Pathways of Chloroanilines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational chemistry allows to elucidate the observed selectivity in the photochemistry of chloroanilines. A meta&#8208;ortho effect of the substituents favours the population of the prefulvenic conical intersection which leads to rapid deactivation of the m&#8208; and o&#8208;isomers of chloroaniline, while the para derivative lives long enough to emit and populate the reactive triplet state which leads to C&#8722;Cl dissociation.







Abstract
Direct excitation of aromatic compounds grants access to high&#8208;energy intermediates that can be utilised in organic synthesis. Understanding and predicting the substituent effects at the excited state for aromatic molecules remains challenging for the synthetic photochemist. In this work, we present an experimental and computational investigation of the excited state of the isomeric chloroanilines, which promptly react by losing the chloride when the amino group is in para position, but are non&#8208;reactive and non&#8208;emissive in the meta and ortho isomers. XMS&#8208;CASPT2//CASSCF computations explain this apparent contradiction of the meta&#8208;ortho selectivity rule of Zimmerman, which originates from the substituent effects lowering to a different extent the barrier to populate the prefulvenic conical intersection that deactivates non&#8208;radiatively the singlet excited state of the chloroanilines.

A review on the carbofluorination of &#960;&#8208;bonds and related transformations involving tandem C&#8722;C/C&#8722;F bond forming reactions is presented. The application of electrophilic fluorine and nucleophilic fluoride reagents in this chemistry is described, as well as recently developed protocols involving the use of fluorinated organic molecules in atom&#8208;economic carbofluorination reactions.







Abstract
Due to the unique properties of C&#8722;F bonds, organofluorine compounds occupy a privileged space in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and polymer industries. Carbofluorination reactions involve the formation of a C&#8722;C and a C&#8722;F bond, typically across a &#960;&#8208;bond or another unsaturated functionality that is revealed upon in situ activation. The design of tailored substrates and new catalyst systems has enabled carbofluorination chemistry to emerge as a promising manifold for the synthesis of unique fluorinated scaffolds. This review covers the application of nucleophilic and electrophilic fluorinating reagents in this chemistry, in addition to recently developed atom&#8208;economical carbofluorination reactions using organofluorine compounds as dual reagents.
