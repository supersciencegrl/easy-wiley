      <title>Role of lipophilicity on the activity of hexameric cyclic peptoid ion carriers</title>
      <dc:description>Two families of hexameric cyclic peptoids decorated with linear  N  &#8208;alkyl and alternated  N  &#8208;alkyl/  N  &#8208;benzyl side chains (  2a&#8208;d  and  3a&#8208;c  , respectively) were designed and synthesized in order to correlate their logP values (from 2.55 to 6.83) to their ionophoric activities. The present contribution confirms the general ability of hexameric cyclic peptoids to behave as efficient cation carriers, corroborates their preference for Na  +  ion, among the tested alkali metals, and suggests a Na  +  /H  +  antiport transport mechanism (rate limited by the transport of the proton) for these new ionophores. Our observations indicate that in order to attain an efficient ionophoric activity, a narrow range of liphophilicity is required (4&lt; logP &lt; 5). Moreover, to gain information on the solid state stucture of ionophoric cyclic peptoids with linear  N  &#8208;side chains,&#160;X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies were performed on exemplar compound  2a  . Crystal structure of compound  2a  confirms the tendency of ionophoric cyclopeptoids with linear  N  &#8208;side chains to form layered assemblies.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
A substrate dependent regio&#8208; and stereoselective domino hydroalkoxylation&#8208;formal cycloaddition is described for the facile synthesis of linear as well as spirocyclic 1,4&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;fused chromenes. The developed hydroalkoxylation cascade offered a quick access to the [6&#8208;6&#8208;7&#8208;6] tetracyclic framework of cytorhizhins B&#8211;D.






A substrate dependent regio&#8208; and stereoselective domino hydroalkoxylation&#8208;formal&#8208;[4+2] cycloaddition is described for the facile synthesis of linear as well as spirocyclic 1,4&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;fused chromene ketals. Enantiospecific synthesis of oxazepino chromene derivatives was successfully carried out using chiral pool amino alkynols. The developed hydroalkoxylation cascade offered rapid access to the spirocyclic [6&#8208;6&#8208;7&#8208;6] tetracyclic core of cytorhizhins B&#8211;D with correct relative configuration.

      <title>Synthesis of Nonulosonic Acids</title>
      <dc:description>
This minireview discusses the recent advances in the synthesis of nonulosonic acids including legionaminic acid, acinetaminic acid, and fusaminic acid.






Bacterial cell&#8208;surface nonulosonic acids are unique in their structural complexity and their biological roles in life processes. Their presence at the non&#8208;reducing end of bacterial cell surface glycans makes them key players in infections related to various multidrug&#8208;resistant pathogens. These glycans are difficult to isolate from natural sources in pure form. Also, due to their complicated structures, access to these rare sugars through synthesis is highly challenging. The most well&#8208;studied bacterial nonulosonic acid is pseudaminic acid which has been synthesized by many groups and reviewed very recently. In this minireview, we discuss the recent advances in the synthesis of remaining nonulosonic acids viz. legionaminic acid, acinetaminic acid, and fusaminic acid.

A common strategy from d&#8208;glucono&#8208;&#948;&#8208;lactone to the pyran natural product phomonol and the phytotoxic nonenolides has been developed. The key steps include a one&#8208;pot conversion of d&#8208;glucono&#8208;&#948;&#8208;lactone to &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#947;&#8208;vinyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactone and diastereoselective Grignard reaction.

A TMSOTf&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular [4+2] cycloaddition of in situ generated aza&#8208;o&#8208;quinone methide acts as an expedient, stereoselective access to cis/trans&#8208;fused furo&#8208;/pyrano[3,2&#8208;c]tetrahydroquinolines with excellent yields and diastereoselectivity.

      <title>Fungicide precursor racemization kinetics for deracemization in complex systems</title>
      <dc:description>In the racemization area, the keto&#8208;enol equilibrium is a major player when it comes to racemizing &#945;&#8208;chiral carbonyl compounds. The racemization kinetics in the co&#8208;crystal induced deracemization of a fungicide precursor is complex as next to the racemization catalyst, which is a base, an acidic co&#8208;former is used to ensure the crystallization of the co&#8208;crystal. Here we show that understanding of the racemization kinetics of the target compound is of key importance for optimization of the co&#8208;crystallization based deracemization process. The racemization rates in solution as a function of solvent and base concentration were determined by measuring the decreasing enrichment of the chiral ketone due to racemization over time, using a polarimeter set&#8208;up with a continuous recycling loop through the polarimeter cell. The established racemization kinetics model aligns with the experimental data giving access to the intrinsic racemization rate constant. The proposed mechanism is first order with respect to the enantiomeric excess of the target compound and the base&#8208;catalyst concentration. The solvent is shown to affect the racemization constant, with protic solvents increasing this rate substantially. Finally, we observed the presence of the chiral acid co&#8208;former to alter the reaction mechanism albeit remaining first order with respect to the enantiomeric excess. Though more complex, the mechanism still followed Arrhenius law, providing key information on the impact of temperature.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>We use click chemistry to functionalize simple lipophilic and water&#8208;soluble molecules, a complex PEGylated phospholipid (DSPE&#8208;PEG2000), and two benzylic substrates with the 2&#8208;(hydroxyimino)aldehyde (HIA) group.

Norrish&#8208;Yang photoisomerization (&#955;= 365 nm, LED source) is successfully obtained, with no interference by the triazole linker, except when the forbidden  n&#8208;&#960;*  carbonyl transition is screened by a remote substituent such as salicylaldehyde. UV&#8208;Vis spectrometry suggests a specific interaction of HIAs with Cu(II), whereas no such evidence is found with Cu(I). We thereby show that the CuAAC methodology can be used successfully to obtain HIA&#8208;based UV&#8208;responsive hydrophilic or lipophilic ligands, phospholipidic components for the construction of liposomes, and macrocycle precursors.</dc:description>

      <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Heterocycles from Aryldiazoacetates**</title>
      <dc:description>
Microwave&#8208;superheated solutions of aryldiazoacetates and 1,2&#8208;diamines mixed in toluene yield rapid access to quinoxalinones and quinoxalines without the use of catalysts, additives or otherwise complicated reaction conditions.






Herein, we describe a rapid microwave&#8208;assisted, metal&#8208;free synthesis of substituted quinoxalinones and quinoxalines using the carbene&#8208;mediated reaction between aryldiazo esters and 1,2&#8208;diamines. The reaction can encompass a range of substituents and structural variations to afford quinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;ones in 14&#8211;80&#8201;% yield and corresponding quinoxalines in good to excellent yields upon oxidation (67&#8211;96&#8201;%). The approach can be employed to generate symmetrical and unsymmetrical 2,3&#8208;diarylquinoxalines, bis&#8208;quinoxalines as well as novel quinoxaline&#8208;substituted diazo esters and should be a valuable addition to the heterocycle synthesis toolbox.

      <title>Double Porphyrin Cage Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>
The synthesis of double porphyrin cage compounds based on glycoluril is described. Through a multistep synthesis, three double cage compounds linked by spacers of variable length are obtained. The binding and conformational properties of their zinc derivatives towards the ditopic ligand dabco have been investigated into detail.






The synthesis and characterization of double porphyrin cage compounds are described. They consist of two porphyrins that are each attached to a diphenylglycoluril&#8208;based clip molecule via four ethyleneoxy spacers, and are linked together by a single alkyl chain using &#8220;click&#8221;&#8208;chemistry. Following a newly developed multistep synthesis procedure we report three of these double porphyrin cages, linked by spacers of different lengths, i.e. 3, 5, and 11 carbon atoms. The structures of the double porphyrin cages were fully characterized by NMR, which revealed that they consist of mixtures of two diastereoisomers. Their zinc derivatives are capable of forming sandwich&#8208;like complexes with the ditopic ligand 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane (dabco).

      <title>Mechanochemistry as a Sustainable Method for the Preparation of Fluorescent Ugi BODIPY Adducts</title>
      <dc:description>Mechanochemistry, i. e., the use of mechanical energy produced by milling or grinding to perform chemical transformations, was used as a green strategy using a minimal amount of solvent for the preparation of highly valuable formyl functionalized BODIPY dyes. The stereoelectronic properties of the  meso  &#8208;aryl group plays a key role in the fluorescence response of the adducts resulting from the Ugi reaction. Such an understanding of the molecular structure&#8208;fluorescence interplay explains the brightness of these dyes in the cellular media monitored by fluorescence imaging. In the present report, we provide flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy evidence that the novel dyes stain efficiently peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and  Candida albicans  cells without disturbing cell integrity. Moreover, it is demonstrated that by staining  C. albicans  cells, we can monitor the early and late steps of phagocytosis, using human monocyte&#8208;derived macrophages. The dye series presented herein represent a novel application for formyl functionalized BODIPY, expanding their applications in monitoring biological processes.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4&#8208;dioxane derivatives are discussed.






New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between N,N&#8208;disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

The key intermediates of these methodologies are 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,3'&#8208;bibenzo[1,2&#8208;  b  :4,3&#8208;  b  ']dithiophenes (  1  ), synthesized through a palladium&#8208;catalyzed homocoupling reaction between two benzo[1,2&#8208;  b  :4,3&#8208;  b  ']dithiophene units followed by a regioselective &#945;&#8208;bromination. Direct palladium&#8208;catalyzed annulation of bromides  1  with internal alkynes provides a set of 7,8&#8208;disubstituted 7&#8208;THs  2  in moderate to good yields (46&#8208;80%). Otherwise, 7&#8208;monosubstituted 7&#8208;THs  4  have been prepared through Sonogashira coupling of  1  with terminal alkynes, followed by platinum&#8208; or indium&#8208;promoted cycloisomerization of alkynyl intermediates  6  . Finally, the versatility of bromides  1  has also been demonstrated by using them for the preparation of benzo (hetero) fused 7&#8208;TH derivatives  7  via Suzuki coupling with (hetero)arylboronic acids and the photocyclization of the obtained intermediates  9  .</dc:description>

      <title>Multibranched calix[4]arene based sensitizers for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production</title>
      <dc:description>In the field of direct production of hydrogen from solar energy and water, photocatalytic methods hold a great potential especially when metal&#8208;free molecular components are preferred. In this work, we have developed a new class of calix[4]arene&#8208;based molecular photosensitizers to be used as antenna systems in the photocatalytic production of hydrogen. The structure of the dyes has a typical donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor molecular architecture where a calix[4]arene scaffold is used as an embedded donor. The new materials have been fully characterized in their optical, electrochemical and photocatalytic properties. The properties conferred by the calix[4]arene donor afforded twice larger performances compared to the corresponding linear system though showing similar quantitative optical properties. The new molecular design paves the way to a new strategy for photocatalytic hydrogen production where the calix[4]arene scaffold can afford more efficient systems, and can offer the potential for host&#8208;guest supramolecular effects.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Herein, we report a simple and efficient approach to synthesize a long functionalized 2,18&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;trioxa[9] helicene.

The molecular integrity of the helical core was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR techniques. Its crystal structure showed the spontaneous resolution which was attributed to the conglomerate formation of same helical isomer via C&#8722;H  &#183;&#183;&#183;&#160;  O and &#960;  &#183;&#183;&#183;  &#960; or H  &#183;&#183;&#183;  &#960; interactions. Then, it was converted to racemic 2,18&#8208;dihydoxy&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;trioxa[9]helicene. Enantiomers were separated on preparative HPLC with high optical purity (&gt; 99 %  ee  ). Based on electronic circular dichroism, the absolute configurations of dextrorotary and levorotatory antipodes were assigned as  P  and  M  , respectively. We also studied the absorption, emission and chiroptical behavior of these helical compounds in the solution state.</dc:description>

The Front Cover shows trans&#8208;Cyclooctenes that serve as asymmetric ligands for the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;additions of organotin reagents to enones. It is demonstrated for the first time that these chiral olefins can provide efficient coordination spheres for asymmetric metal catalysis. As the asymmetric environment around the reaction site is constructed by the trans&#8208;cyclooctene framework, the introduction of a substituent at the allylic position further improves enantioselectivity to 93% ee.

Herein, we describe a fast and easy procedure for their synthesis by a telescoping reaction integrating an iron&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer under mild conditions.

      <dc:description>
This Minireview highlights the prominent reactivities of aliphatic geminal diazide compounds, including thermolysis, photolysis, and cycloadditions, most of which yielding unique classes of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. We also present how this, still uncommon, class of compounds can be used for amide bond formation and the degradation of a carbon framework, under the action of nucleophilic amines.






Organic compounds with geminal diazide units at sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms are a widely neglected class of compounds, with regard to their synthesis and their reactivities. In the last decade, we and others started to uncover reactivity patterns with this compound class, leading to new possibilities of reaction design. This minireview covers recent developments in the field, including the generation of heterocycles through thermolysis, the reactions with nucleophilic amines, and the hydrogenation.

We have developed a novel synthetic methodology for the preparation of tetra&#8208;annulated fluorenofurans and fluorenopyrans using calcium(II)&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component reaction. In this reaction, tert&#8208;propargyl alcohols react with 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls to form tetra&#8208;substituted allenes, which are subsequently undergoing regiodivergent annulation with sec&#8208;propargyl alcohols to produce the fluorene&#8208;fused furan compounds. Broad substrate scope, regioselectivity, gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and benzylic functionalization of products are some of the highlights of this protocol.

      <dc:description>A simple, photochemical and metal&#8208;free protocol for the atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) of bromotrichloromethane onto various alkenes is described. Among a range of organic molecules, phenylglyoxylic acid proved to be the most suitable photoinitiator to promote a sustainable process for the addition of bromotrichloromethane to olefins. This photochemical atom transfer radical protocol can be expanded into a wide substrate scope of aliphatic olefins bearing various functional groups, leading to the corresponding products in good to excellent yields.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A simple, photochemical and metal&#8208;free protocol for the atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) of bromotrichloromethane onto various alkenes is described. Among a range of organic molecules, phenylglyoxylic acid proved to be the most suitable photoinitiator to promote a sustainable process for the addition of bromotrichloromethane to olefins. This photochemical atom transfer radical protocol can be expanded into a wide substrate scope of aliphatic olefins bearing various functional groups, leading to the corresponding products in good to excellent yields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Oxidative Copper Catalyzed Regioselective Trifluoromethylation of Fused Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]N&#8208;heteroarenes using Langlois, (NaSO2CF3) Reagent as CF3 Source</title>
      <dc:description>A simple, mild and efficient oxidative copper catalyzed regioselective trifluoromethylation of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]N&#8208;heteroarenes have been developed using Langlois, (NaSO2CF3) reagent as CF3 source. This method gives biologically relevant trifluoromethylated fused imidazoles in moderate to good yields with good functional group tolerance. The key features of the reaction are mild conditions, short reaction time and room temperature reaction.</dc:description>

      <title>Facile Thiol&#8208;ene Click Protocol Using Benzil as Sensitizer and White LED as Light Source</title>
      <dc:description>The thiol&#8208;ene reaction leading to a series of thioether derivatives by simple metal and oxidant free visible light promoted photosensitized protocol following anti&#8208;Markonikov hydrothiolation of unactivated aryl and alkyl olefins at room temperature is demonstrated. Benzil served as a green photosensitizer in this reaction and white LED lights as a light source. This radical based thiol&#8208;ene reaction is operationally simple and tolerates a wide variety of functional groups present in olefins.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Gold(III) coordination of new chiral polydentate (  N,)N,O  &#8208;pyridine based ligands is reported.
