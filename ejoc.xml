         <title>Cyclopropyl for Gem&#8208;Dimethyl: Synthesis and Olfactory Properties of Linear Musks with Cyclopropyl Spacers**</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fusing the gem&#8208;dimethyl groups into a cyclopropyl ring in the spacer of linear alicyclic musk odorants subtly changes the molecular geometry and polarity of the target structures while the musk odour is retained or even intensified. Aromatic analogues and methylcyclopropane derivatives in contrast were found completely odourless..

Linear musks with cyclopropylmethyl spacers in place of 2&#8208;methylpropyl spacers were designed, synthesised and evaluated olfactorily. Their synthesis commenced from commercially available 1&#8208;(3&#8242;, 3&#8242;&#8208;dimethylcyclohexyl)ethanone (Herbac) and 3&#8208;methyl benzaldehyde via the corresponding methyl carbinols, Cyclodumol and 1&#8208;(m&#8208;tolyl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;ol, which were esterified with a protected glycolic acid and then transformed into the corresponding cyclopropyl compound by Tebbe olefination in tandem with Simmons&#8211;Smith cyclopropanation. After deprotection and esterification with various short&#8208;chain carboxylic acids, their qualitative olfactory evaluation revealed that fusing the gem&#8208;dimethyl groups into a cyclopropyl ring retains and even intensifies the musk scent. Methylation of the cyclopropyl ring however completely erases not only the distinct musk character but virtually any odour.

         <title>Mechanochemical Alkynylation of Isatin with Calcium Carbide: Experimental and Computational Insights into Selectivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of isatin, CaC2, and KOtBu in dimethylsulfoxide has been reported to afford mono&#8208;alkynylation products, whereas we found that under the mechanochemical conditions, the bis&#8208;alkynylation pathway is preferred. In this work, we investigated this transformation experimentally and computationally, both in solution and under mechanochemical conditions, to elucidate the factors governing the selectivity switch.

Alkynylation of isatins with calcium carbide (CaC2) in solution has been reported to selectively yield mono&#8208;alkynylation products (i.e., 3&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles). In this work, we studied the reaction under mechanochemical conditions, finding that upon ball milling, the acetylenic anions [C2]2&#8211; present in CaC2 react with isatin, leading preferentially to the bis&#8208;alkynylation addition product [i.e., 3&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;bis(3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole)]. Through experimental work and computational mechanistic studies within the framework of density functional theory, we investigated the change in selectivity and identified i) the highly concentrated reaction environment under ball milling and ii) the avoidance of bulk water as conditions that favor the bis&#8208;alkynylation of two isatin molecules with a single [C2]2&#8211; fragment. In addition, we found that the reaction occurs through several variants of the same overall mechanism, in which some cationic metal counterions play a relevant role through noncovalent interactions.

         <title>Defective NiO Nanoparticles Supported on Nb2O5 for Solid&#8208;Catalyzed Markovnikov&#8208;Selective Hydroboration of Styrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiO deposited on Nb2O5 was an efficient catalyst for Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydroboration of styrenes using B2(pin)2. The catalytically active species were NiO on Nb2O5 and leached Ni species. The coexistence of ZnO served as a redeposition site for the leached Ni species, improving the reusability of the catalyst system.

Markovnikov selective hydroboration of alkenes with an air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable diboron reagent is a more challenging reaction than the anti&#8208;Markovnikov&#8208;selective one. We report that nickel oxide (NiO) supported on niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5) efficiently catalyzed the hydroboration of 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylstyrene, affording a Markovnikov (branched) adduct with excellent selectivity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydroboration of styrenes with a diboron reagent, bis(pinacolato)diboron, using a solid catalyst. NiO on Nb2O5 contains Ni3+, which is more catalytically active than Ni2+, as a major species in contrast to bulk NiO. However, the catalytic activity decreased upon recycling tests because the Ni species leached from NiO/Nb2O5. The catalytically active species were NiO on Nb2O5 and leached Ni species. To improve the reusability of the catalyst system, NiO/Nb2O5, ZnO was introduced as a redeposition site for the leached Ni species. Ultimately, the desired Markovnikov adduct was obtained in high yield and selectivity using NiO/Nb2O5 in the presence of ZnO (92% yield and 92% selectivity), and catalyst reusability was also improved.

         <title>Synthetic Strategies to Access Fluorinated Azoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent synthetic strategies for introducing fluorine groups (mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and trifluoromethylation) into 11 major azole classes, identifying research gaps to inform future innovations in materials science, medicinal chemistry, and biomedical research.

Incorporating fluorine into azoles is not only a common practice but also an essential tactic in medicinal chemistry, due to their ability to fine&#8208;tune a molecule's physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles. The strategic introduction of fluorine into nitrogen&#8208;containing five&#8208;membered heterocycles can significantly enhance metabolic stability, membrane permeability, and binding affinity&#8212;key factors in modern drug development. This review provides an up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of key synthetic strategies for monofluorination, difluoromethylation, and trifluoromethylation across 11 prominent azoles: 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles, 1,2,4&#8208;triazoles, tetrazoles, pyrazoles, imidazoles, pyrroles, isoxazoles, oxazoles, thiazoles, thiadiazoles, and isothiazoles. This review aims to identify current limitations in the field and delineate existing research gaps that present further opportunities for innovation in these domains, which are essential for propelling pharmaceutical and biomedical research. By integrating new synthetic advancements and diverse strategies to access them, this review aims to serve as both a practical guide and a source of inspiration for chemists exploring the next generation of fluorinated azole pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Dihydropyranones through Cyclization and Organometallic Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable method for synthesizing 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydropyran&#8208;2&#8208;ones (MeO&#8208;DHP&#8208;2&#8208;ones) via base&#8208;promoted cyclization of hydroxy alkynes is presented. Mechanistic and computational studies guided the transformation into 4,5&#8208;dihydropyran&#8208;4&#8208;ones (DHP&#8208;4&#8208;ones), enabling access to spiroacetal precursors relevant to natural product synthesis.

Dihydropyranones are key structural motifs in biologically active polyketides. We report a reproducible and scalable method for synthesizing 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydropyran&#8208;2&#8208;ones (MeO&#8208;DHP&#8208;2&#8208;ones) via base&#8208;promoted cyclization of hydroxy alkynes. Mechanistic and computational studies revealed that water content and reaction time critically influence lactonization efficiency.

&lt;p&gt;A scalable method for synthesizing 3-methoxy-4,5-dihydropyran-2-ones (MeO-DHP-2-ones) via base-promoted cyclization of hydroxy alkynes is presented. Mechanistic and computational studies guided the transformation into 4,5-dihydropyran-4-ones (DHP-4-ones), enabling access to spiroacetal precursors relevant to natural product synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dihydropyranones are key structural motifs in biologically active polyketides. We report a reproducible and scalable method for synthesizing 3-methoxy-4,5-dihydropyran-2-ones (MeO-DHP-2-ones) via base-promoted cyclization of hydroxy alkynes. Mechanistic and computational studies revealed that water content and reaction time critically influence lactonization efficiency. Two optimized protocols &#8211; using potassium carbonate (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) or in situ generated sodium methoxide (MeONa) &#8211; enabled consistent yields across multiple substrates.

         <title>Photocatalysis 1,6&#8208;Addition for Site&#8208;Selective Alkylation of para&#8208;Quinone Methides (p&#8208;QMs) via Amidyl Radical 1,2&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild photocatalytic protocol synthesizes diverse diarylmethane derivatives (39 examples, good yields) via 1,2&#8208;HAT of N&#8208;benzoyloxyamides generating carbon radicals, followed by selective coupling with para&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs).

Under light irradiation, a novel photocatalytic reaction between para&#8208;quinone methides (p&#8208;QMs) and N&#8208;benzoyloxyamides has been developed to synthesize substituted diarylmethane derivatives, which exhibit potential biological activities. This reaction proceeds under mild conditions, affording 39 compounds with good yields and broad substrate applicability. Mechanistic studies reveal that N&#8208;benzoyloxyamides undergo 1,2&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (1,2&#8208;HAT) to generate carbon&#8208;centered radicals, which subsequently undergo selective radical&#8211;radical coupling with p&#8208;QMs to form the diarylmethane framework.

Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;mucocin isolated from Rollinia mucosa (Annonaceae) was achieved. Stereoselective construction of the tetrahydropyran (THP) ring moiety was performed using diastereoselective oxypalladation. The tetrahydrofuran (THF) ring moiety was prepared from (S)&#8208;(&#8211;)&#8208;malic acid. The cross&#8208;metathesis reaction between the THP and THF moieties afforded the nonadjacent THP&#8211;THF core part.

Thiocyanated pyrrolidines were synthesized from unactivated alkenes by aminothiocyanation under mild electrochemical conditions. This method features broad substrate scope, excellent selectivity, and enables late&#8208;stage thiocyanation of bioactive molecules.

We report herein an electrochemical aminothiocyanation protocol for the synthesis of thiocyanated pyrrolidines from unactivated alkenes. This method exhibits mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, excellent regioselectivity, and can be applied for late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecules. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction might proceed via a sulfonium ion pathway.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reagent&#8208;driven efficient stereoselective total synthesis of anti&#8208;inflammatory (&#8208;)&#8208;berkeleyamide A, and its unnatural congeners was developed by nonnucleophilic bulky base&#8208;mediated asymmetric aldol reaction from Meldrum's acid.

The total synthesis of anti&#8208;inflammatory (&#8208;)&#8208;berkeleyamide A (with an overall yield of 40%) and its seven stereoisomers was accomplished from inexpensive Meldrum's acid. The reagent&#8208;controlled KOtBu&#8208;mediated syn&#8208;aldol adduct (&gt;76% yield and&#8201;&gt;90% diastereoselectivity) afforded the natural (10S, 11R,14S)&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;berkeleyamide A. Notably, an exclusive anti&#8208;aldol adduct, formed via LiHMDS/TMEDA&#8208;mediated aldol reaction, produced (10S, 11S,14S)&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;11&#8208;epi&#8208;berkeleyamide A as a single crystal. While the use of LDA and NaHMDS yielded both syn&#8208; and antiadducts, enabling access to all stereoisomers. The required aldol partners, chiral &#947;&#8208;lactam and aliphatic aldehyde, were both produced from Meldrum's acid in 3&#8208; and 5&#8208;step sequences, respectively, with high yields (each step &gt;87%). The 2D NMR studies and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic data assisted in assigning the stereochemistry of all the stereoisomers.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Investigations of Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Chemo&#8208;, Regio&#8208;, and Stereoselective cis&#8208;Hydroboration of 1,3&#8208;Enynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed mechanism supported by kinetic experiments, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and X&#8208;ray crystallography is proposed for the chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective hydroboration of 1,3&#8208;enynes. Hydrocupration was determined to be the turnover&#8208;limiting step and essential for selectivity. An off&#8208;cycle, cyclic CuHBpinOAc complex is proposed to explain a positive fractional rate order in catalyst.

The mechanistic details of the chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective cis&#8208;hydroboration of 1,3&#8208;enynes were investigated using X&#8208;ray crystallography, kinetic analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The kinetic analysis revealed that the reaction is first order in enyne, zeroth order in HBpin, and fractional order in the catalyst. Our studies suggest that a cyclic CuHBpinOAc complex is an off&#8208;cycle species (via DFT analysis) that contributes to the experimentally observed fractional rate order regarding the catalyst.

&lt;p&gt;A detailed mechanism supported by kinetic experiments, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and X-ray crystallography is proposed for the chemo-, regio-, and stereoselective hydroboration of 1,3-enynes. Hydrocupration was determined to be the turnover-limiting step and essential for selectivity. An off-cycle, cyclic CuHBpinOAc complex is proposed to explain a positive fractional rate order in catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanistic details of the chemo-, regio-, and stereoselective &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-hydroboration of 1,3-enynes were investigated using X-ray crystallography, kinetic analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The kinetic analysis revealed that the reaction is first order in enyne, zeroth order in HBpin, and fractional order in the catalyst. Our studies suggest that a cyclic CuHBpinOAc complex is an off-cycle species (via DFT analysis) that contributes to the experimentally observed fractional rate order regarding the catalyst. Experimental and computational data suggest that hydrocupration is rate-limiting and essential for achieving selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Naphthalene Diimide&#8208;Based Small&#8208;Molecule Semiconductors Enabling Air&#8208;Stable n&#8208;Type Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel small molecule semiconductors with low&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals were designed and synthesized for ambient&#8208;stable organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) with over 97% electron mobility retained after 2 weeks&#8217; storage in ambient conditions. Flexible OFETs fabricated via air&#8208;water interfacial self&#8208;assembly achieve electron mobility of 4.49&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;3 and 7.21&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;3&#8201;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.

The development of ambient&#8208;stable n&#8208;type organic semiconductors is a critical yet challenging research frontier. Herein, we report a rational molecular design by functionalizing naphthalene diimide (NDI) cores with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing termini via thiophene bridges. Density functional theory calculations revealed enhanced planarity and significantly lowered lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals energy level (&lt;&#8722;4.1&#8201;eV), which were corroborated by photophysical and electrochemical analyses. The solution&#8208;processed organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) demonstrated electron mobilities over 10&#8722;3&#8201;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, all of which were fabricated and measured under ambient conditions. Remarkably, the devices retained&#8201;&gt;97% performance after 2&#8208;week storage in ambient conditions. Furthermore, to evaluate the potential of the semiconductors for flexible electronics applications, we fabricated flexible OFETs by integrating the self&#8208;assembled NDI&#8208;4X (X&#8201;=&#8201;F, Cl) thin films prepared via air&#8208;water interfacial self&#8208;assembly. Also under ambient conditions, the devices exhibited higher electron mobilities of 4.49&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;3 (NDI&#8208;4F) and 7.21&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;3&#8201;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1(NDI&#8208;4Cl) than their halogen&#8208;free counterpart NDI&#8208;4H (1.14&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;3&#8201;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). This work demonstrates that introducing strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups at both ends of electron&#8208;deficient units provides an effective pathway to achieve ambient&#8208;stable n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule semiconductors, thereby enabling their application in next&#8208;generation, ambient&#8208;operating flexible organic electronics.

         <title>Synthesis and Physicochemical Characterization of 2&#8208;Azabicyclo[3.2.0]heptane Building Blocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An expedient multigram synthesis of diastereopure 2&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.0]alkane&#8208;derived building blocks is developed by sequential construction of the cyclobutane and pyrrolidine rings by ketene [2+2] cycloaddition and lactam formation, respectively. The title scaffold is characterized by measurements of physicochemical and structural parameters supported by exit vector plot analysis to evaluate its potential for isosteric replacement in medicinal chemistry.

A convenient approach to the synthesis of diastereopure 6&#8208; and 2,6&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.0]hexanes is reported. The method is based on the sequential construction of the cyclobutane and pyrrolidine rings of the target bicyclic system via [2+2] ketene cycloaddition and lactam formation, respectively. Although the key cycloaddition step had modest stereoselectivity (dr 2:1), the target bicyclic product could be obtained as a pure diastereomer without using chromatographic purification. The reaction sequence commences from readily available starting materials and is easily scalable (up to 32.8&#8201;g). Utility of the synthesized intermediates is demonstrated by the preparation of a series of exo&#8208; and endo&#8208;isomeric amino alcohols and monoprotected diamines&#8212;valuable building blocks for drug discovery. Their potential for isosteric replacements is evaluated by measuring physicochemical properties, as well as structural studies and exit vector plot analysis.

         <title>From Light&#8208;Driven to Dark Synthesis: Streamlining Perfluoroalkyl Selenide Ether Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two orthogonal and user&#8208;friendly protocols enable the efficient construction of (Se/S)&#63743;RF bonds from simple dichalcogenides and perfluoroalkyl iodides. Visible&#8208;light irradiation at 395&#8201;nm promotes seleno&#8208; and thioether formation, while a dark KOH/MeCN variant delivers selenoethers in minutes. Both approaches operate under mild, metal&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions, tolerate biologically relevant substrates, and scale smoothly to gram quantities.

Two complementary and operationally simple methods enable the efficient perfluoroalkylation of organodiselenides: (i) direct visible&#8208;light irradiation at 395&#8201;nm in aqueous MeCN with RF&#8211;I, requiring no photocatalyst, and (ii) a base&#8208;promoted protocol using KOH in MeCN under dark conditions. Both furnished perfluoroalkyl selenoethers in excellent yields, while only the photoinduced protocol delivered good to excellent yields of perfluoroalkyl thioethers from organodisulfides. The direct irradiation approach also enables the preparation of Se&#8208; and S&#8208;perfluoroalkylated derivatives of selenocysteine and cysteine, highlighting the applicability to biologically relevant substrates. Both protocols feature excellent chemical selectivity, good functional group tolerance, mild conditions, and simple operation. Compared with existing photocatalytic and thermal methods, these approaches provide greater versatility and operational simplicity, exemplified by the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of a perfluoroalkyl selenoether in excellent yield.

         <title>Recent Advances in Iron&#8208;Photocatalyzed Decarboxylative C&#63743;C Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent progress in photoinduced iron&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative C&#63743;C bond formation using alkyl carboxylic acids and their derivatives as radical precursors. It emphasizes the mechanistic insights, substrate versatility, and synthetic utility of this environmentally benign strategy, highlighting its potential for constructing complex molecules and its growing impact in modern organic synthesis.

In recent years, iron&#8208;photocatalyzed decarboxylative C&#63743;C bond formation has emerged as a sustainable and versatile strategy in synthetic chemistry. This approach harnesses earth&#8208;abundant and cost&#8208;effective iron complexes, which undergo ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer under visible&#8208;light irradiation to generate alkyl radicals directly from readily available carboxylic acids. The resulting radical intermediates participate in diverse C&#63743;C bond&#8208;forming processes, including alkyl&#8722;alkyl, alkyl&#8722;aryl, and alkyl&#8722;alkenyl couplings, enabling rapid access to structurally complex scaffolds from simple feedstock chemicals. In this perspective review, recent progress in substrate scope, catalytic design, and mechanistic understanding, is highlighted with particular emphasis on synthetic applications in late&#8208;stage functionalization and pharmaceutical intermediate construction. These advances not only underscore the unique reactivity of iron photocatalysts but also point toward future opportunities for expanding their utility in green and scalable C&#63743;C bond&#8208;forming methodologies.

One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Ferrocene Thioamides from Ferrocenecarboxaldehyde via the Willgerodt&#8211;Kindler Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of ferrocene thioamides is synthesized via Willgerodt&#8211;Kindler reaction from ferrocenecarboxaldehyde. Two experimental protocols are developed to effectively employ both primary and secondary amines. The solvent screening reveals a highly positive effect of amide solvent on the reaction. Mechanistic study helps to elucidate the role of Na2S as promoted rather than the catalyst.

Ferrocene thioamides are potential alternatives for classical oxoamide&#8208;type ferrocene ligands with broad applications in metal&#8208;catalyzed transformations as well as substrates for C&#63743;H activations and applications in other fields. A reaction of ferrocenecarboxaldehyde with various amines and sulfur promoted by sodium sulfide furnishes a wide range of ferrocene thioamides via the Willgerodt&#8211;Kindler multicomponent reaction. The detailed solvent screening reveals that amide&#8208;type solvents are highly beneficial for the reaction. The steric hindrance of bulky amine substrates limits the reaction. While secondary amines require only conventional heating, primary amines yield better results with microwave irradiation at higher temperatures. The mechanism is investigated using nuclear magnetic resonance kinetic measurements, which show that Na2S acts as a promoter, rather than a catalyst, of the reaction.

         <title>Vicinal Pyrazolyl&#8208;Phosphine Imines and their Palladium Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrazolyl phosphines bearing a vicinal aminal group are synthesized and hydrolyzed to formyl derivatives and cyclic phosphonium salts, with product ratios depending on HCl concentration. The corresponding methylimines act as bidentate ligands forming Pd(II) complexes, while phosphonium salts afford a Pd(IV) complex confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography.

Readily available 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;5&#8208;(N,N,N&#8242;&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;N&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)diamino&#8208;methyl)pyrazoles are employed as starting materials for the synthesis of pyrazolyl phosphines. Subsequent hydrolysis yields the expected 4&#8208;diphenylphosphino&#8208;5&#8208;formylpyrazoles, accompanied by the formation of cyclic phosphonium salts. The product distribution is found to depend on the concentration of hydrochloric acid: higher acid concentrations favored the formation of cyclic phosphonium salts. A similar behavior is observed for the methylimines derived from 4&#8208;diphenylphosphino&#8208;5&#8208;formylpyrazoles. These imines acted as bidentate ligands, readily forming palladium(II) complexes. In contrast, the cyclic phosphonium salts reacted with dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) to afford a palladium(IV) complex, the structure of which is confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Directed Sulfinylation of Distal C(sp3)&#63743;H Bonds by Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 40, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox/copper&#8208;cocatalyzed remote C&#63743;H sulfoxidation reaction is described that proceeds through radical&#8208;mediated 1,5&#8722;hydrogen atom transfer. A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction between N&#8722;alkoxypyridinium salts and sodium arylsulfinates gave a series of hydroxy sulfoxide derivatives. This transformation features redox&#8208;neutral conditions, broad functional group compatibility, and excellent site selectivity.

An efficient photoredox&#8208;catalyzed reaction is reported for site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#63743;H sulfoxidation of N&#8208;alkoxypyridinium salts using sodium arylsulfinates as sulfinyl donors. This transformation involves alkoxy&#8208;radical&#8208;directed 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (1,5&#8722;HAT) followed by C(sp3)&#63743;S bond formation. A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven, copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling strategy enables the synthesis of a series of hydroxyl sulfoxide derivatives. This methodology establishes a novel synthetic platform for rapid construction of sulfoxide&#8208;containing molecular architectures, demonstrating remarkable functional group compatibility and predictable regioselectivity.

         <title>Electrochemical Tandem Self&#8208;Coupling/Selenylation of Acetonitrile toward Highly Functionalized Tetrasubstituted Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 40, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical tandem self&#8208;coupling/selenylation of acetonitrile delivers (Z)&#8208;tetrasubstituted alkenes with amino, cyano, and seleno groups. This potassium iodide&#8208;mediated, metal/oxidant&#8208;free protocol features simple operation, high chemoselectivity, and excellent stereoselectivity.

Herein, an electrochemical tandem reaction that integrates acetonitrile self&#8208;coupling with selenylation to construct densely functionalized tetrasubstituted alkenes bearing amino, cyano, and seleno groups from readily available acetonitrile and diselenides is reported. Employing potassium iodide as a redox mediator under mild, metal&#8208;free, and oxidant&#8208;free conditions, this sustainable strategy leverages the synergistic effect of electrochemical oxidation and iodine catalysis to achieve inert C(sp3)&#63743;H bond activation of acetonitrile. The transformation exhibits good stereoselectivity along with substrate scope across diverse aryl and alkyl selenides.

Multicomponent reactions are excellent tools to generate complex structures with broad chemical diversity and fluorescent properties. The sonochemical multicomponent one&#8208;pot synthesis of novel organic luminescent heterocycles, such as 2&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine (2&#8208;HPIP) analogs, is described. The Groebke&#8211;Blackburn&#8211;Bienaym&#233; reaction (GBBR) affords good to excellent yields (75&#8211;95%). Notably, the compound 4b forms an intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonded eight&#8208;membered ring (8&#8208;MR) in the crystalline state and is luminescent in this phase; in solution, this compound exhibits dual band emission with a very large Stokes shift of 18&#8201;382&#8201;cm&#8722;1 attributed to an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process. Time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) and additional calculations are performed to evaluate the HOMO&#8211;LUMO distributions and theoretical absorption spectra, being in agreement with the experimental data. Additionally, the TD&#8208;DFT calculations in solution (chloroform) show the ESIPT process and 8&#8208;MR formation become thermodynamically favorable in 4b. This work represents the first synthesis of prompts feasibility ESIPT heterocyclic luminescent materials via an eight&#8208;membered ring (8&#8208;MR) with an N&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#63743;O connection.

This work represents the first synthesis of prompts feasibility ESIPT heterocyclic luminescent materials via an eight-membered ring (8-MR) with an N&#183;&#183;&#183;H&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O connection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Electrochemical Tandem Cyclization of N&#8208;(But&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl)Anilines to Access Trifluoromethylated Tetrahydroquinoline Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 40, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a series of 34 trifluoromethylated tetrahydroquinoline derivatives were synthesized through a one&#8208;step trifluoromethylation/cyclization cascade reaction, enabling the simultaneous construction of two C&#63742;C bonds. This transformation was achieved using a green and efficient electrocatalytic approach, without requiring metal catalysts. Control experiments suggest that the reaction likely proceeds via a radical&#8208;initiated mechanism.

A novel electrochemical cascade strategy enables dual C&#63742;C bond formation through trifluoromethylation and C(sp2)&#8208;H functionalization of N&#8208;(but&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl)anilines derivatives. This protocol efficiently constructs structurally diverse trifluoromethylated tetrahydroquinoline derivatives in moderate to good yields. It operates under mild reaction conditions, uses readily available substrates, proceeds without metal catalysts, and achieves the construction of two C&#63742;C bonds in a single step. Detailed mechanistic studies demonstrate that a sequential single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process triggers the radical cascade reaction.

         <title>Regiocontrolled Cleavage of Dialkyl Ethers Using Regenerative Borates as a Sustainable Alternative to Boron Trichloride</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 40, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of triaryl borates for highly selective ether cleavage is described. The borate is regenerable from the aqueous extract of a previous ether cleavage reaction without repurification, making use of low toxicity boron and phenolic waste. Such strategies for C&#63743;O cleavage are expected to be broadly applicable to synthetic manipulations where management of waste is critical.

Ethers are ubiquitous functional groups in natural products, surfactants, and materials, making them valuable targets for chemical diversification. This report advances a previously reported method utilizing a 1:1 mixture of BBr3 and BCl3 to cleave unsymmetric dialkyl ethers with high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity. In this new protocol, regenerable triaryl borates are used in place of BCl3, offering a more sustainable approach. Importantly, all boron&#8208;containing byproducts from the reaction can be converted back into the triaryl borate, enabling full reagent recovery. The speciation of borate/BBr3 mixtures is monitored by 11B&#8208;NMR and compared to the previously studied BCl3/BBr3 system. Additionally, Design of Experiments (DOE) statistical analysis reveals a correlation between borate Lewis acidity and cleavage selectivity. The triaryl borate regenerated in&#8201;situ from aqueous waste performs comparably to freshly prepared material in subsequent reactions. Overall, this system matches or exceeds the performance of the original BBr3/BCl3 method across a broad range of dialkyl ether substrates.

         <title>All&#8208;Visible&#8208;Light Diarylethene Photoswitches and Control over Dynamic Conjugate Addition Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 40, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoswitches by fusing &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl motif with dithienylethene (DTE) scaffold. The photoswitches exhibit reversible photochromic behavior under visible&#8208;light, with enhanced efficiency through electronic modulation. Moreover, DTEs enable visible&#8208;light&#8208;controlled C&#63743;S bond formation and cleavage, providing a platform for recyclable and biocompatible materials.

All&#8208;visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoswitches are gaining significant attention for their environmental friendliness and biocompatibility. Here, a series of visible&#8208;light responsive photoswitches is presented by embedding &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl motifs into the ethene bridge of dithienylethene (DTE) scaffolds. Through electronic modulation and &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension, the absorption is redshifted into the visible range, enabling reversible photochromic ring&#8208;closure and ring&#8208;opening under blue and red light, respectively. Density functional theory calculations reveal that electron&#8208;withdrawing groups and extended conjugation narrow the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, enhancing photoswitching efficiency. Furthermore, these photoswitches also function as dynamic Michael acceptors, allowing visible&#8208;light&#8208;controlled C&#63743;S bond formation and cleavage with great reversibility. The work described offers a versatile platform for visible&#8208;light&#8208;regulated dynamic covalent chemistry and paves the way for the development of recyclable, biocompatible materials.

Dibenzofulvenes (DBFs) and 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinones (PQs) are synthesized through a coupling reaction of 2&#8208;bromobiaryl compounds with different ester electrophiles by using the unique reactivity of organolanthanum heterocyclic intermediates. This method features a one&#8208;pot procedure, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, readily available substrates, and the ability to provide direct access to both DBFs and PQs.

Dibenzofulvenes (DBFs) and 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinones (PQs) are valuable biaryl derivatives with unique applications in many fields. The development of their synthetic methods is of great importance in organic synthesis. A one&#8208;pot coupling reaction of 2&#8208;bromobiaryls with ester electrophiles is reported, exploiting the exceptional reactivity of organolanthanum heterocyclic intermediates. The reaction enables precise installation of C&#63742;C and C&#63742;O moieties at the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;positions of biaryl scaffolds, providing convenient access to DBFs and PQs with high efficiency and good substrate availability.

         <dc:description>
A methodology for the preparation of imines from amines by means of an electrocatalytic aminoxyl&#8208;mediated reaction.

A methodology is reported for the preparation of imines from amines by means of an electrocatalytic aminoxyl&#8208;mediated reaction. It is performed using readily available electrodes in a commercially available electrochemistry apparatus and does not require the use of a reference electrode. The methodology proceeds under mild conditions and delivers good to excellent isolated yields across a range of structurally diverse benzyl amines. Selectivity is high, with imines obtained in preference to the more commonly reported nitriles, and the process is readily scalable to the gram level. Operational simplicity and short reaction times make this method a valuable addition to the organic chemist's toolkit.

&lt;p&gt;A methodology for the preparation of imines from amines by means of an electrocatalytic aminoxyl-mediated reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A methodology is reported for the preparation of imines from amines by means of an electrocatalytic aminoxyl-mediated reaction. It is performed using readily available electrodes in a commercially available electrochemistry apparatus and does not require the use of a reference electrode. The methodology proceeds under mild conditions and delivers good to excellent isolated yields across a range of structurally diverse benzyl amines. Selectivity is high, with imines obtained in preference to the more commonly reported nitriles, and the process is readily scalable to the gram level. Operational simplicity and short reaction times make this method a valuable addition to the organic chemist's toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A New Methodology for Preparing Benzylated Aminopyridines Yields Previously Inaccessible Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 40, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnBr2&#8208;induced benzylation of 4&#8208;aminopyridineswith suitable alcohols or diols provides access to novel organocatalysts of the unprecedented diarylpyrrolidionopyridine type, as well as new benzylmethylaminopyridine catalysts. These catalysts are practically inaccessible by other routes and exhibit high activity and site selectivity in the phosphorylation of amphiphilic diols.

p&#8208;Dialkylaminopyridines represent a key class of nucleophilic organocatalysts, widely used in alcohol&#8208;modifying reactions, among other applications. However, access to certain variants of these catalysts, particularly those with sterically congested secondary sphere, remains challenging or even unfeasible using previously established synthetic routes. Lewis acid&#8208;promoted benzylation or cyclative dibenzylation of simple aminopyridines with corresponding alcohols effectively overcomes these shortcomings. This innovative approach enables the synthesis of previously inaccessible (2,5&#8208;diarylpyrrolidino)pyridines and novel (N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;N&#8208;methylamino)pyridines bearing extended ortho&#8208;alkoxy tails on the aryl substituents. The new catalysts, characterized by their bulky secondary sphere, exhibit outstanding activity and high site&#8208;selectivity in the phosphorylation of a model diol amphiphile.

         <title>Exploration of Structure&#8211;Property Relationships by Altering Glycol Backbone Unsaturation (Double/Triple Bonds) in Furan&#8208;Based Polyesters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 40, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores how adding unsaturated groups to bio&#8208;based furanic polyesters can change their stiffness and heat resistance. While this offers new possibilities, it also needs careful control during production. It is shown that solution polycondensation works well for making these materials and offers a path toward more flexible, stable, and ecofriendly polymers.

This study highlights both the challenges and opportunities associated with developing bio&#8208;based furanic polyesters. Incorporating unsaturated moieties into glycol chains effectively modulates polymer rigidity and thermal properties, though it requires careful optimization of polymerization conditions. The findings demonstrate the viability of solution polycondensation for synthesizing high&#8208;quality FDCA&#8208;based polyesters with unsaturated glycols and pave the way for further investigations into polymer design strategies that balance flexibility, thermal stability, and environmental sustainability.

         <title>Basicity and Lipophilicity of gem&#8208;Difluorinated Saturated Bicyclic Amines: Advanced Building Blocks for Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 40, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed study of the physicochemical properties of gem&#8208;difluorinated bicyclic amines is reported. pKa and LogP measurements reveal interesting trends affected by the fluorination pattern of the compound and the bicyclic system itself, which are partially rationalized through molecular electrostatic potential surface analysis.

The impact of gem&#8208;difluorination on the physicochemical properties of bicyclic saturated amines with 6&#8211;8 atoms in the largest ring is studied. The fluorination effect on the acidity of protonated species (pKa) aligns with predictions based on the inductive effect of the electron&#8208;deficient substituent. In contrast, lipophilicity (LogP) could either increase or decrease due to gem&#8208;difluorination. The observed effect depends on the number of vicinal C&#63743;H bonds relative to the fluorine atoms, but it is also influenced by their relative spatial orientation and the structure of the bicyclic core itself.

         <title>Exploring the Chemical Reactivity of Triisopropylsilyl Dialkynylmethanol for the Synthesis of Dialkynylcarbinol&#8208;Related Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 40, October 29, 2025. </description>

The relevance of 1&#8208;(triisopropylsilyl)penta&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;ol as a versatile C5 organic framework is highlighted in both racemic and enantiopure form thanks to a finely optimized lipase&#8208;mediated enzymatic kinetic resolution procedure. This straightforward approach, exploiting the reactivity of the terminal alkyne group, opened the way for the most cytotoxic series to date of bioinspired lipidic alkynylcarbinols.

Prompted by the pharmacological relevance of lipidic alkynylcarbinols, 1&#8208;(triisopropylsilyl)penta&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;ol is exploited as a versatile C5 organic framework. Selective functionalization of this dissymmetrical dialkynylcarbinol precursor is achieved via the creation of either a Csp&#8211;Csp (alkyne), a Csp&#8211;Csp2 (alkene and aryl), or a Csp&#8211;Csp3 (RCHOH) bond. A novel series of racemic HSD17B11&#8208;bioactivated procytotoxic acetylenic lipids is accessed that revealed, amongst the most potent to date, with IC50 down to 27&#8201;nM on osteosarcoma U2OS cells. Click&#8208;type 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions, such as a copper&#8208;catalyzed reaction with a long&#8208;chain alkyl azide (CuAAC) and a base&#8208;promoted reaction with a lipidic nitrile oxide, are first described in a racemic version. Preparation of both enantiomers of 1&#8208;(triisopropylsilyl)penta&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;ol through kinetic enzymatic resolution with CAL&#8208;B immobilized on acrylic resin is carefully optimized. Finally, the use of resolved samples in 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions leads to the enantioenriched cycloadducts without significant epimerization of the carbinol center.

         <title>Amidine Syntheses from Classic to Contemporary for Medicinal Lead Compounds and Natural Products</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 40, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A revolution is underway in the synthesis of amidines with new methods unlocking complex, highly substituted amidines or closely related derivatives such as N&#8208;sulfonyl amidines. This review surveys recent advances in amidines and related compounds, including methods to install them and bioactive molecules prominently featuring the amidine functionality.

For close to 150&#8201;years, the Pinner reaction between nitriles and amines dominated the syntheses of amidines.

&lt;p&gt;For close to 150&#8201;years, the Pinner reaction between nitriles and amines dominated the syntheses of amidines. Today, the Pinner reaction remains highly over-represented in recent syntheses of unsubstituted or simple amidines. However, a number of greener amidine syntheses unlock access to more complex, highly substituted amidines, or closely related derivatives such as &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-sulfonyl amidines.

         <title>Multistep Reactions Initiated by Amine&#8208;Based Organometallic Methods</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 40, October 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advent of C&#8211;H activation and other organometallic methodologies making use of transient directing groups or free amines themselves for the elaboration of amine substrates provides unique access to cascade&#8208;type reactions that can generate significant molecular complexity in one pot.

The pursuit of atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical pathways to access complex heterocycles and functionalized scaffolds has driven advances in the use of transient and free amine directing groups that exploit native coordination properties for multistep synthesis. Traditional protection&#8208;functionalization&#8208;deprotection sequences, while effective in some circumstances, introduce inefficiencies that compound across multistep syntheses. The following strategies address three critical challenges: 1) eliminating auxiliary installation/removal, 2) enabling multistep functionalization without intermediate isolation (in many cases), and 3) maintaining compatibility with sensitive functional groups. This review aims to collectively summarize the developments in amine&#8208;based synthesis that make use of the amine both as a directing group and a reactive partner in subsequent reaction steps. By analyzing mechanistic insights and substrate scope limitations across these methodologies, one can identify unresolved challenges and provide insight on future directions.

         <title>Toward Novel Trifluoromethylated Peptidomimetics: A Case Study of Cathepsin C Inhibitors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of CF3&#8208;containing amino acid analogues is prepared and studied by docking to Cathepsin C. The results highlight their potential as peptidomimetics and showcase the value of fluorination in drug design.

Herein, both synthetic and theoretical results related to the development of amino acid analogues containing a CF3&#8208;olefinic moiety and their evaluation as potential inhibitors of Cathepsin C are presented. The key synthetic steps include the trifluoromethylation using the Ruppert&#8211;Prakash reagent and a Horner&#8211;Wadsworth&#8211;Emmons olefination to obtain the desired CF3&#8208;alkenyl amino acid derivatives. In recent years, theoretical approaches based on molecular docking have gained significant attention for predicting the biological activity of synthetic compounds as enzyme inhibitors. The research specifically targets Cathepsin C, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase I, a protease that plays a crucial role in activating various degradative enzymes involved in tissue damage during inflammatory diseases.

         <title>Convenient Synthesis of C&#8208;Linked &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Galactosides with Lipophilic Aglycone Component Toward Lectin A Inhibition and Antibiofilm Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an ESKAPE pathogen, relies on lectin A (LecA) for adhesion, biofilm formation, and virulence making it a promising therapeutic target. Hydrolytically stable novel C&#8208;linked monovalent D&#8208;galactosides A, B, and C with lipophilic aglycone component are synthesized using Weinreb&#8208;amide&#8208;based building block 15 and are evaluated for bacterial biofilm inhibition activity.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a member of the World Health Organization&#8208;listed ESKAPE pathogens, exhibits high drug resistance and relies on the galactose&#8208;specific lectin LecA for adhesion, biofilm formation, and virulence. Targeting lectin A (LecA) emerges as a promising antivirulence strategy. While multivalent D&#8208;galactoside derivatives demonstrate strong LecA binding and biofilm disruption, their high molecular weight, synthetic complexity, and poor pharmacokinetic profiles limit clinical potential. In contrast, monovalent &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;galactosides with aromatic aglycons offer improved drug&#8208;likeness and bioavailability, though typically with moderate potency. The hydrophobic pocket adjacent to LecA's binding site inspires lipophilic modifications to enhance activity, yet most inhibitors remain O&#8208; or S&#8208;linked glycosides. C&#8208;linked &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;galactosides, which are hydrolytically more stable, remain underexplored. Motivated by their potential advantages, the design and synthesis of hitherto unreported monovalent C&#8208;linked &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;galactoside ligands with aryl aglycones, represented by general structures A, B, and C, is proposed as new LecA inhibitors for combating P. aeruginosa biofilm.

         <title>Electrocatalytic C&#63743;H Annulation of Alkynes to Functionalized Heterocycles: Synthesis and Mechanical Insights</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical C&#63743;H annulation of alkynes represents a sustainable and efficient pathway for constructing functionalized heterocycles. This work highlights, how alkyne integration enables the creation of nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;containing scaffolds with adaptable features for pharmaceuticals, materials, and catalysis. Integrating transition&#8208;metal and metal&#8208;free electrocatalysis, this overviews the selective and eco&#8208;friendly routes for redefining heterocycle synthesis through controlled alkyne activation.

Heterocyclic frameworks are indispensable in pharmaceuticals, advanced materials, and catalysis owing to their diverse structures and wide&#8208;ranging functionalities. In recent years, electrochemical C&#63743;H annulation using alkynes has emerged as a green and selective platform for the efficient construction of these complex systems. By avoiding stoichiometric oxidants and enabling reagent&#8208;free processes, this methodology reduces environmental impact while improving synthetic efficiency. Alkyne incorporation plays a pivotal role in modulating the electronic and biological properties of nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;rich heterocycles, which are prominent in bioactive compounds. Innovations in electro&#8208;oxidative processes and transition&#8208;metal catalysis have significantly advanced the field, allowing for precise and sustainable transformations. Herein, the synthesis of functionalized heterocycles employing annulation of alkynes electrocatalytically, role of catalysts, and mechanistic insights are overviewed by critically investigating the recent progress in crafting next&#8208;generation heterocyclic scaffolds with functional versatility.

Innovations in electro-oxidative processes and transition-metal catalysis have significantly advanced the field, allowing for precise and sustainable transformations. Herein, the synthesis of functionalized heterocycles employing annulation of alkynes electrocatalytically, role of catalysts, and mechanistic insights are overviewed by critically investigating the recent progress in crafting next-generation heterocyclic scaffolds with functional versatility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Catalyzed C3&#8211;H Sulfinylation of Indoles with Sulfenamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes an efficient iodine&#8208;catalyzed C3&#8211;H sulfinylation of indoles, employing sulfenamides as sustainable sulfur sources under transition&#8208;metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions.

Organic sulfides, particularly 3&#8208;sulfinylindoles, have garnered substantial attention owing to their remarkable pharmacological activities and broad applications in materials science and pesticide chemistry. Nevertheless, traditional synthetic approaches for 3&#8208;sulfinylindoles usually suffer from drawbacks such as toxic reagents, dependence on transition&#8208;metal catalysts, and severe reaction conditions. Herein, an iodine&#8208;catalyzed C3&#8211;H sulfinylation strategy is presented for the synthesis of 3&#8208;sulfinylindoles, employing sulfenamides as stable and odorless sulfenylating reagents. This protocol proceeds under mild conditions (100&#8201;&#176;C in 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane) without extra oxidants or additives, delivering a broad range of 3&#8208;sulfinylindole derivatives in moderate to excellent yields. Substrate scope investigations demonstrate excellent compatibility with indoles having electron&#8208;donating/withdrawing groups and sulfenamides containing aromatic/heterocyclic groups. This method addresses critical challenges in traditional sulfinylation, providing a green, metal&#8208;free, and efficient approach for the construction of thiofunctionalized indole derivatives with potential applications in drug discovery and functional materials.

The synthesis of 1,1&#8208;dibromo&#8208;3,4,4&#8208;trichloro&#8208;2&#8208;cyano&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene (3) provides a selective access to the new class of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyano&#8208;thiophenes 2. The unique push&#8211;pull substitution pattern of 2 allows a chemoselective modification in the 2 and 5 positions. Derivatization of 2 is accomplished by selective S&#8208;oxidation of the vinylsulfanyl unit. Substitution of the resulting vinylsulfinyl group of 14 by halogen nucleophiles led to dihalothiophenes 16 and 17 in good yields. A subsequent selective dehalogenation in the 2 and 5 positions is accomplished, leaving the 3,4&#8208;push&#8211;pull unit untouched. The new 2,5&#8208;dihalothiophenes, as well as the 2,5&#8208;unsubstituted thiophene 20, are interesting monomers for the preparation of highly conducting polythiophenes.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated 2&#8208;Arylindoles with High Quantum Yields and Tunable Spectroscopic Features</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New &#960;&#8208;conjugated 2&#8208;arylindole&#8208;based fluorophores bearing (hetero)aryleneethynylene units and a pendant ester group are prepared. These show high fluorescence quantum yields (up to 94%) and solvatochromic effects. The ester moiety allows easy access to other functional groups, such as an N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide whose reactivity can be exploited for proteins and antibodies bioconjugation.

Indole&#8208;based fluorophores represent a promising class of fluorescent probes due to their tunable optical properties, structural versatility, and compatibility with biological systems. In this work, the design, synthesis, and photophysical characterization of a new series of 2&#8208;arylindole derivatives functionalized with (hetero)aryleneethynylene units and a pendant ester group are reported. The compounds are synthesized via Fischer indole synthesis followed by Sonogashira coupling, enabling also the introduction of electron&#8208;donating (&#8211;NMe2) and electron&#8208;withdrawing (&#8211;CN) substituents. Furthermore, they are decorated with an N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimidyl (NHS) moiety for facile bioconjugation. Spectroscopic studies conducted in solvents of varying polarity reveal strong solvatochromic effects, high fluorescence quantum yields (up to 94%), and emission wavelengths spanning the blue to green region. Selected derivatives are successfully conjugated to bovine serum albumin, thanks to the NHS reactive group. Photophysical measurements of the resulting protein conjugates reveal that the fluorophores remain solvent&#8208;exposed, maintaining their emission profiles in aqueous media&#8212;an important feature for potential bioimaging and sensing applications. These findings highlight the utility of indole&#8208;based scaffolds for the development of environmentally responsive fluorescent probes.

         <title>Salt&#8208;Free CatAnionic Vesicular Nanoreactor from Dithiocarbamate: Michael Addition of Nitroolefins in Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A salt&#8208;free CatAnionic vesicular nanoreactor is developed from dithiocarbamate amphiphiles via a simple one&#8208;step synthesis. These self&#8208;assembled vesicles catalyze aqueous Michael additions with high efficiency, enable one&#8208;pot transformations, and demonstrate reusability and recyclability, providing a sustainable approach for organic synthesis and pharmaceutical intermediate preparation.

The salt&#8208;free CatAnionic vesicle is previously generated by mixing cationic and anionic amphiphiles and removing the salt that occurred as a byproduct from the mixture. In this study, a new strategy to produce the salt&#8208;free CatAnionic vesicle of N,N&#8208;dialkylammonium N,N&#8208;dialkyldithiocarbamate (AmDTC) is reported through a one&#8208;step condensation between secondary amine and CS2. The AmDTC dispersed in water, resulting in the spontaneous formation of salt&#8208;free CatAnionic vesicles. Among several AmDTCs, the N,N&#8208;didodecylammonium N,N&#8208;didodecyldithiocarbamate (AmDTC&#8208;C12) showed high stability and is applied as a vesicular nanoreactor for the Michael addition in water. These vesicles catalyzed aqueous Michael additions of nitroolefins, affording 23 adducts in 65%&#8211;92% yields. The vesicles enabled preparative&#8208;scale and one&#8208;pot Michael addition by in&#8201;situ generation of AmDTC&#8208;C12 vesicle afforded the Michael adducts also in good yields. The AmDTC&#8208;C12 vesicular nanoreactor is applied for the synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;baclofen with 54% yields over three steps. Reusability of the AmDTC&#8208;C12 is demonstrated and allowed the reuse up to seven cycles. Finally, chemical recycling of N,N&#8208;didodecylamine precursor is demonstrated by converting AmDTC&#8208;C12 to N,N&#8208;didodecylammonium chloride salt by simple acidification. Owing to their simple precursors and mild synthesis, salt&#8208;free CatAnionic vesicles from AmDTC show promising and untapped potentials as organocatalysts and delivery applications.

A mechanochemical strategy has been developed for the nickel&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of cyano esters derived from phenol, as electrophilic substrates using arylboronic acids via Csp2&#63743;O bond cleavage.

This approach capitalizes on the abundance of phenols, using cyano&#8208;functionalized derivatives to enable high reactivity and functional group compatibility without halogenated reagents. The reaction is carried out under solvent&#8208;free, temperature&#8208;trace conditions, significantly reducing environmental impact. The methodology offers a sustainable and scalable alternative for biaryl synthesis, with implications for pharmaceutical and material sciences.

         <title>A Practical and Scalable Synthesis of Cyclized and Uncyclized Xanthene&#8208;1,8&#8208;Dione Derivatives Using Cyanuric Chloride as a Green Organocatalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical and eco&#8208;friendly approach for the synthesis of 1,8&#8208;dioxo&#8208;octahydroxanthene derivatives is described, employing water as the sole solvent under mild, metal&#8208;free conditions. This versatile protocol delivers both uncyclized and cyclized products with good to excellent yields, broad substrate scope, and superior green chemistry metrics with low E&#8208;factor, making it a valuable contribution to sustainable synthetic methodologies.

A mild, water&#8208;mediated protocol has been developed for the synthesis of both uncyclized and cyclized 1,8&#8208;dioxo&#8208;octahydroxanthene derivatives under ambient conditions. Utilizing cyclic&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds and structurally diverse aromatic or heteroaromatic aldehydes, the transformation proceeds efficiently with cyanuric chloride (TCT) as a green organocatalyst. The reaction conditions are finely tunable, allowing selective access to either uncyclized intermediates or cyclized products by adjusting time and temperature, thereby enabling modular control over product outcomes. The protocol also demonstrates excellent compatibility with isatin derivatives, yielding spirooxindolo xanthenedione frameworks in high yields. Substrate scope evaluation revealed broad functional group tolerance, with several products displaying notable biological activities, including anticancer, antibacterial, and antileishmanial properties. All synthesized compounds are fully characterized using spectroscopic techniques such as 1H, 13C, and mass spectroscopy. A detailed, plausible mechanism for the transformation has also been proposed and discussed. Comprehensive green metrics, including atom economy, E&#8208;factor, process mass intensity, and other metrics, are calculated for each cyclized derivative. Gram&#8208;scale experiments further confirmed the scalability and environmental sustainability of this operationally simple, metal&#8208;free, and energy&#8208;efficient protocol.

Cu(I)&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Mono&#8208; and N,O&#8208;Diallylation of Nitroaromatic Compounds Using Allylic Borane&#8208;Amine Adducts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DABCO adduct of triallylic boranes in the presence of simple copper(I) catalyst transforms of nitroaromatics (including heteroaryls) to either N,O&#8208;diallylated or N&#8208;allylated hydroxylamines. This transformation possesses high selectivity and scalability, performs under mild conditions and controls by the addition of alcoholates.

Amine adducts of triallylic boranes reductively allylate nitroaromatic compounds in the presence of 1&#8211;5&#8201;mol% of phosphine&#8208; or NHC&#8208;copper(I) complexes, yielding N,O&#8208;diallylic hydroxylamines with high selectivity. The reaction rate is strongly dependent on the amine component of the adducts, with the DABCO adduct proving the most reactive. The effects of solvent, ligands, and temperature on yield and selectivity are investigated. Even sterically hindered nitroaromatics, such as 2,6&#8208;dimethylnitrobenzene underwent selective monoallylation providing N&#8208;allyl&#8208; and N&#8208;(methallyl)hydroxylamines. The reaction's broad scope is demonstrated with 22 different nitroaromatics bearing both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents and it is successfully scaled up to 6&#8201;grams. Allylation of 2&#8208;allylnitrobenzene for mechanistic studies revealed the formation of indoline derivatives, indicating the involvement in the transformation of N&#8208;centered radicals. This is further supported by the isolation of traces of bicyclic compounds derived from radical cyclizations during the reaction with nitrobenzene.

&lt;p&gt;DABCO adduct of triallylic boranes in the presence of simple copper(I) catalyst transforms of nitroaromatics (including heteroaryls) to either &lt;i&gt;N,O&lt;/i&gt;-diallylated or &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-allylated hydroxylamines. This transformation possesses high selectivity and scalability, performs under mild conditions and controls by the addition of alcoholates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amine adducts of triallylic boranes reductively allylate nitroaromatic compounds in the presence of 1&#8211;5&#8201;mol% of phosphine- or NHC-copper(I) complexes, yielding &lt;i&gt;N,O&lt;/i&gt;-diallylic hydroxylamines with high selectivity. The reaction rate is strongly dependent on the amine component of the adducts, with the DABCO adduct proving the most reactive. The effects of solvent, ligands, and temperature on yield and selectivity are investigated. Even sterically hindered nitroaromatics, such as 2,6-dimethylnitrobenzene underwent selective monoallylation providing &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-allyl- and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(methallyl)hydroxylamines. The reaction's broad scope is demonstrated with 22 different nitroaromatics bearing both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents and it is successfully scaled up to 6&#8201;grams. Allylation of 2-allylnitrobenzene for mechanistic studies revealed the formation of indoline derivatives, indicating the involvement in the transformation of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-centered radicals. This is further supported by the isolation of traces of bicyclic compounds derived from radical cyclizations during the reaction with nitrobenzene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

An efficient, green, and regioselective one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component synthesis of thiopyranochromenones has been developed. It combines aromatic aldehydes and &#946;&#8208;enaminones with 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2H&#8208;chromene&#8208;2&#8208;thiones, using triphenylphosphine and N&#8208;bromosuccinimide as mediators.

         <title>Regioisomeric Effect on the Photocatalytic Properties of Photoluminescent Aromatic Cyano&#8208;Methoxybenzenethioethers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic donor&#8722;acceptor cyanoarenes have risen as potent, fine&#8208;tunable photocatalysts. However, the structural effects of derivatives with thiophenol donors are poorly understood. Herein, the study and identification of some structure&#8208;photocatalytic activity relationships of a regioisomeric series of methoxythiophenol&#8208;cyanoarenes by evaluating them in two distinct model photoredox and energy transfer&#8208;catalyzed reactions is presented.

Organic donor&#8722;acceptor photocatalysts are very appealing for the discovery and effective application in photocatalytic transformations, for which the understanding of the structural implications in their photoactivity is key for success. In this work, the structure&#8208;photocatalytic activity relationship of a regioisomeric series of cyanoarene&#8208;based systems bearing methoxythiophenol units as donor groups is presented. To this aim, their activity in two distinct photoredox and triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer (EnT)&#8208;catalyzed reactions is evaluated. On the one hand, while all catalysts show good oxidizing properties in the excited state, photochemical partial degradation leading to a mixture of photoactive species hampers the correlation between the redox potentials of the initial species and the observed reactivity on a test photoredox reaction. On the other hand, two structure&#8211;property relationships could be identified in the case of the test EnT reaction. Thus, a para&#8208;dicyanobenzene backbone leads to higher triplet energies, followed by the meta and ortho isomers, while meta&#8208;methoxythiophenol donor groups prove more efficient for applications in EnT catalysis. Hence, this study allows for the identification of key structural features, as well as good candidates for each targeted reaction, showing the potential of aromatic thioethers as photocatalysts for a variety of light&#8208;mediated processes.

         <title>Unlocking the Potential of Ferrocene&#8208;Functionalized Donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;Acceptor Systems with Phthalimide/Naphthalimide Acceptors for Non&#8208;volatile Memory Devices</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferrocene&#8208;based donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A) systems, incorporating ferrocene as the donor moiety connected by an acetylene linkage and functionalized with naphthalimide or phthalimide acceptor units, have been developed for nonvolatile resistive switching memory devices demonstrating stable binary write&#8208;once&#8208;read&#8208;many memory characteristics.

A series of donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A) push&#8208;pull compounds incorporating ferrocene as the electron donor and phthalimide/naphthalimide as electron acceptors are designed and synthesized for nonvolatile memory applications. These compounds exhibit excellent solubility in common organic solvents, ensuring suitability for solution&#8208;processed device fabrication. The strong donor&#8211;acceptor interactions in the D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A architecture enable efficient charge injection and transfer, essential for write&#8208;once&#8208;read&#8208;many memory behavior. Among the synthesized compounds, a naphthalimide derivative with a trimethoxyphenyl substituent shows superior performance, with a low threshold voltage of &#8722;1.1&#8201;V, a high ON/OFF ratio (&#8776;104), and a retention time of 2000&#8201;s. Systematic studies using optical, electrochemical, and theoretical analyses reveal that functional group modifications on the acceptor significantly influenced the electronic properties, particularly tuning the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (2.8&#8211;3.1&#8201;eV). These variations affect charge transport and bistable switching characteristics. Electrochemical measurements confirm the ferrocene core's redox&#8208;active nature and acceptor units&#8217; key role in enabling bistability. Theoretical simulations further elucidate charge trapping and release mechanisms. Overall, this work highlights the potential of ferrocene&#8208;based D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A systems for next&#8208;generation organic memory devices and provides valuable insights into structure&#8211;property relationships governing device performance.

Herein, a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free alkynylthiolation of tertiary &#945;&#8208;carbonyl bromides with 1,2,3&#8208;thiadiazoles is reported. Those reactions involve the in situ generation of alkynylthiolate anions from 1,2,3&#8208;thiadiazoles in the presence of a base and then their halogenophilic nucleophilic substitution (SN2X) reactions. The exceptionally mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance highlight the utility of this method to prepare privileged motifs from readily available 1,2,3&#8208;thiadiazoles and tertiary &#945;&#8208;carbonyl bromides feedstocks.

         <title>How Additives Enable Site&#8211;Selective Hydrogen Atom Transfer in Alcohols: Critical Roles of Intrinsic Charge Transfer and Peripheral Electrostatic Interactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Additives enable site&#8208;selective hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) in alcohols by enhancing both through&#8208;bond orbital interactions and through&#8208;space electrostatic stabilization. Different additives regulate HAT selectivity through distinct mechanisms. While ZnCl2 promotes &#945;&#63743;C&#63743;H activation primarily by strengthening orbital interactions, borinic acid and the H2PO4 anion facilitate &#945;&#63743;C&#63743;H abstraction mainly via electrostatic stabilization. 

The roles of different types of additives or cocatalysts in modulating the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process of alcohols are computationally investigated. The approach of energy decomposition analysis is employed to dissect intermolecular interactions between radicals and C&#63743;H substrates, thereby identifying key factors governing HAT site selectivity. The results reveal that different additives can alter the intermolecular interactions, leading to distinct factors governing HAT site selectivity. Specifically, ZnCl2 promotes &#945;&#63743;C&#63743;H bond activation by enhancing charge transfer from the &#945;&#63743;C&#63743;H &#963; orbital to the singly occupied molecular orbital of nitrogen. Borinic acid and H2PO4 anion favor &#945;&#63743;C&#63743;H abstraction by introducing peripheral electrostatic interactions that stabilize the positively charged radical species.

         <title>Synthesis of Unnatural Aplysiatoxin Analogs with High Affinity for Protein Kinase C</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the course of synthetic study of aplysiatoxin, a potent protein kinase C (PKC) activator, it is serendipitously found that a five&#8208;membered ether 1 obtained as an undesired product from alkyne&#8208;containing macrodiolide 2 with Au catalyst shows a high affinity for PKC. Synthesis of ten analogs lead to compound 26 showing a higher affinity to PKC.

Aplysiatoxin (ATX) is a marine polyketide macrodiolide and a potent activator of protein kinase C (PKC), which results in a variety of biological events, including inflammation and tumor promotion. This synthetic study of ATX leads to the serendipitous discovery of macrodiolide 1, which showed a high affinity for PKC&#948; despite having a different ring system to ATX. Here, the synthesis of ten analogs of 1&#160;is reported, one of which, unsaturated macrodiolide 26, showed a higher affinity to PKC than compound 1.

         <title>New Approaches in Catalytic Reactions Using Triphos: A Classical Privileged Ligand</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over the past decades, multiple catalytic transformations have been feasible due to the application of triphos (1,1,1&#8208;tris((diphenylphosphino)methyl)ethane) as privileged ligand. This review highlights relevant advances in selected ruthenium&#8208; and cobalt&#8208;triphos catalysed reactions such as N&#8208;alkylation, formic acid dehydrogenation, and bond cleavages.

Over the past decades, multiple catalytic transformations have been feasible due to the application of triphos as ligand. Its particular fac coordination mode, to a transition metal center provides a suitable flexibility enabling variation on the coordination mode resulting in metal stabilization. Most of the reported catalytic reactions have been dominated by the use of the ruthenium&#8208;triphos system, either by application of well&#8208;defined complexes or the in&#8201;situ formed complex. However, in the last years, the emergence of cobalt complexes with comparable or even superior catalytic performance than ruthenium have been reported. In this review, the use of triphos is focussed in selected reactions such as N&#8208;alkylation, formic acid dehydrogenation, and bond cleavage.

         <title>Point&#8208;to&#8208;Axis Optical Activity Induction in Extended, Sterically Congested Chromophoric Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of terephthalaldehyde derivatives has been tested as a chirality sensor for primary amines. The central unit of the probe serves as an amine binder by forming imine bonds and is flanked by two extended chromophoric units. The impact of modifying the wings with diphenylamine or carbazole units, which affects the properties of the probes, is discussed.

The readily available, modular, and electronic circular dichroism (ECD)&#8208;silent derivatives of terephthalaldehyde (the probes) have exhibited an induced optical activity (OA) upon condensation with chiral primary amines. The central unit of the probe serves as an amine binder by forming imine bonds and is flanked by two extended chromophoric units (the wings). Modification of the wings by diphenylamine or carbazole units affects the sterical and spectroscopic properties of the probes. An increase in sterical congestion within the probe core results in a change in the mechanism of OA induction. In the more congested systems, the point&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transmission from the chiral amine (the inducer) to the chromophoric system leads to the adaptation of helical conformation by &#8220;the wings&#8221; and the appearance of nonzero Cotton effects in the low&#8208;energy part of the ECD spectrum. However, the sterically congested probes are sensitive to the chirality of the inducers but relatively indifferent to the differences in their structure. Thus, the chirality of the inducers triggers conformational change toward the thermodynamically preferred conformational diastereoisomer due to the probe's &#8722;1 to +1 operation scheme.

         <title>Role of Quantum Tunneling in Synthetic Organic Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum mechanical tunneling, an alternative reaction pathway to the classical thermal one, is rarely considered in organic synthesis. However, there is growing evidence of its profound impacts, for example, in limiting access to target molecules or determining reaction outcomes. This article highlights recent exemplary studies and explores how concepts like tunneling control and instability can inform synthesis design and optimization.

Quantum mechanical tunneling offers an alternative dynamical pathway to the classical (thermal) overcoming of energetic barriers, by penetrating these barriers instead. Recent years have shed light on its impact on organic synthesis in terms of kinetics, reaction outcomes, and lifetimes (and thus feasibility) of reactive intermediates or supposedly stable products. This concept article summarizes recent computational and experimental studies and illuminates how the insights from these studies, for example, regarding the concepts of tunneling control and instability, should inform synthesis design and optimization.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Convergent Synthesis of Heterocyclic Compounds via C&#63743;H Activation/Cyclization: An Overview and Summary Toward Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current progress in tandem C&#63743;H activation reactions involving terminal alkynes. It predominantly covers the synthesis of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered heterocycles, as well as fused heterocycles, with an emphasis on specific topics, including purely chemical synthesis, electrochemical synthesis, and enantioselective synthesis.

The development of one&#8208;step transformations to heterocyclic compounds would considerably boost the synthetic efficiency in organic chemistry. In recent years, numerous examples of the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed (TMC) C&#63743;H activation/annulation strategy have been reported. Despite remarkable progress achieved with internal alkynes, allenes, and alkyne surrogates, terminal alkynes remain challenging substrates. Due to their relatively acidic terminal protons, terminal alkynes easily undergo alternative homocoupling reactions under commonly used oxidative conditions, exhibiting significant difficulties in C&#63743;H functionalizations. To date, the C&#63743;H activation involving terminal alkynes remains one of the most promising and appealing areas in organic synthesis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current progress in tandem C&#63743;H activation reactions with terminal alkynes. With a strong emphasis on the catalysis of Rh and Co transition metals, it predominantly covers the synthesis of five&#8208;, six&#8208;membered heterocycles, and fused heterocycles. In this protocol, specific topics, such as purely chemical synthesis, electrochemical synthesis, and enantioselective synthesis, mechanistic details associated with the documented reactions are discussed. In addition, a tactical user guidance for terminal alkynes&#8208;participated C&#63743;H activation is also put forward.

     alt="Transition-Metal-Catalyzed Convergent Synthesis of Heterocyclic Compounds via C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H Activation/Cyclization: An Overview and Summary Toward Terminal Alkynes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current progress in tandem C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H activation reactions involving terminal alkynes. It predominantly covers the synthesis of five- and six-membered heterocycles, as well as fused heterocycles, with an emphasis on specific topics, including purely chemical synthesis, electrochemical synthesis, and enantioselective synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of one-step transformations to heterocyclic compounds would considerably boost the synthetic efficiency in organic chemistry. In recent years, numerous examples of the transition-metal-catalyzed (TMC) C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H activation/annulation strategy have been reported. Despite remarkable progress achieved with internal alkynes, allenes, and alkyne surrogates, terminal alkynes remain challenging substrates. Due to their relatively acidic terminal protons, terminal alkynes easily undergo alternative homocoupling reactions under commonly used oxidative conditions, exhibiting significant difficulties in C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H functionalizations. To date, the C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H activation involving terminal alkynes remains one of the most promising and appealing areas in organic synthesis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current progress in tandem C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H activation reactions with terminal alkynes. With a strong emphasis on the catalysis of Rh and Co transition metals, it predominantly covers the synthesis of five-, six-membered heterocycles, and fused heterocycles. In this protocol, specific topics, such as purely chemical synthesis, electrochemical synthesis, and enantioselective synthesis, mechanistic details associated with the documented reactions are discussed. In addition, a tactical user guidance for terminal alkynes-participated C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H activation is also put forward.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H bond functionalization protocol for 1&#8208;naphthylamine derivatives is reported, enabling efficient and regioselective synthesis of 8&#8208;benzylated 1&#8208;naphthylamides directly from aryl aldehydes via benzylic C&#63743;H activation. Utilizing a bidentate directing group strategy, the reaction exhibits broad substrate tolerance with good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. The methodology effectively combines photochemical reactivity with Pd catalysis in a flow microreactor setup, facilitating the capture and use of short&#8208;lived reactive intermediates.

Herein, a continuous photo&#8208;flow protocol for quinolinamide&#8208;directed regioselective C&#8208;8 benzylation of 1&#8208;naphthylamine derivatives via C&#63743;H bond functionalization with flow&#8208;generated aryldiazomethanes is reported. A wide range of 8&#8208;benzylated&#8208;1&#8208;naphthylamide products are afforded in satisfactory yields upon palladium catalysis via a bidentate directing process under illumination by 12&#8201;W blue light&#8208;emitting diodes (450&#8201;nm). This mild, simple, and convenient synthetic method allows a wide range of easily handled aryl aldehydes, without the exclusion of either moisture or oxygen. This transformation is environmentally friendly and operationally simple, and it can be easily scaled up to the gram scale with good selectivity. Finally, an improved protocol for C&#63743;H functionalization is described, which relies on the use of a continuous&#8208;flow photo&#8208;microreactor.

         <title>A Greener Approach to 2,5&#8208;Furandicarboxylate Macrocycles and their Entropically Driven Ring Opening Polymerization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid&#8208;based polymers are obtained through the entropically driven ring&#8208;opening polymerization of the corresponding macrocyclic oligoesters (MCOs). MCOs are synthesized using cyclopentyl methyl ether as a green solvent and purified without column chromatography. Properties of the resulting polyesters are evaluated and compared between the different techniques.

Thermoplastic polyesters (PEs), with their versatile properties, are indispensable in everyday life. However, increasing concerns about the environmental impact of fossil&#8208;based polymers have driven research into renewable alternatives. Among bio&#8208;based polymers, furan&#8208;derived PEs such as poly(ethylene furanoate) (PEF) have garnered significant attention. The synthesis of PEF, as well as other similar 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA)&#8208;based polymers, is mainly based on bulk polycondensation (PC) that in general requires elevated temperatures and low pressure, making the process energy&#8208;intensive and vulnerable to thermo&#8208;oxidative degradation. In this view, entropically driven ring opening polymerization (ED&#8208;ROP) might represent an interesting potential alternative since it requires milder conditions and is intrinsically more atom economic. From these premises, this work focuses on developing an alternative synthetic strategy to bio&#8208;based PEs through ED&#8208;ROP of macrocycles derived from FDCA dimethyl ester (FDME). These macrocycles were prepared by reacting FDME with diols via pseudo&#8208;high dilution condensation (PHDC) using dibutyltin(IV) oxide as a catalyst and cyclopentyl methyl ether as a recyclable green solvent. Isolation of the pure macrocycles is achieved by simple crystallization from the reaction mixture. Subsequent ROP of pure macrocycles is investigated as a viable route to prepare the related PEs in mild reaction conditions.

The parent 5,5&#8242;&#8208;binaphtho[2,1&#8208;d]isoxazole and its 3,3&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl and 3,3&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl derivatives are synthesized via condensation of the respective dicarbonyl compounds with hydroxylamine, followed by cyclodehydration of the resulting dioximes. The dicarbonyl precursors are obtained through 4&#8208; or 6&#8208;step sequences from 1&#8208;naphthol or 1&#8208;naphthaldehyde, involving oxidation, methylation, demethylation, coupling, bromination, formylation, esterification, and Fries rearrangement.

Incorporation of aldehyde groups at the 3,3' positions of [1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;diol required oxidative coupling of 1&#8208;methoxynaphthalene to 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene, bromination, formylation, and demethylation. Incorporation of benzoyl groups at the 3,3' positions of [1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;diol required subjecting either 1&#8208;(4&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;naphthyl)(phenyl)methanone to the Ullmann reaction conditions or 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene to the Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction with benzoyl chloride.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Assisted In&#8208;Water [3&#8201;+&#8201;2] Cycloaddition for the Synthesis of Fused Pyrrolizidine and Indolizidine Scaffolds with Anticancer Activity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable, ultrasound&#8208;assisted intramolecular (3&#8201;+&#8201;2) cycloaddition in water enables efficient one&#8208;pot access to fused&#8208;pyrrolizidine and indolizidine scaffolds. The method offers high atom economy, low E&#8208;factor, and reveals a striking mechanistic divergence between ultrasound and thermal pathways. Its practicality is showcased through gram&#8208;scale synthesis, late&#8208;stage functionalization, and potent anticancer activity against triple&#8208;negative breast cancer.

An ultrasound&#8208;assisted in&#8208;water intramolecular (3&#8201;+&#8201;2) cycloaddition reaction is reported for the synthesis of fused&#8208;pyrrolizidine and indolizidine frameworks. This approach eliminates the need for organic solvents, harsh reagents, and high temperatures.

&lt;p&gt;A sustainable, ultrasound-assisted intramolecular (3&#8201;+&#8201;2) cycloaddition in water enables efficient one-pot access to fused-pyrrolizidine and indolizidine scaffolds. The method offers high atom economy, low &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-factor, and reveals a striking mechanistic divergence between ultrasound and thermal pathways. Its practicality is showcased through gram-scale synthesis, late-stage functionalization, and potent anticancer activity against triple-negative breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Modular Synthesis of 3,4&#8208;Disubstituted Pyrroles Through Three&#8208;Component Van Leusen Reaction of Propargylamines with Tosylmethyl Isocyanide and Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel three&#8208;component strategy for the synthesis of valuable 3,4&#8208;disubstituted pyrroles from easily available propargylamines, tosylmethyl isocyanide, and water in the presence of DBU has been developed.

A novel three&#8208;component van Leusen strategy has been developed for the efficient and straightforward synthesis of valuable 3,4&#8208;disubstituted pyrroles from easily available propargylamines, tosylmethyl isocyanide, and water. This transformation advances through the formation of a pyrrole framework via [3&#8201;+&#8201;2] cycloaddition with tosylmethyl isocyanide and a sequential nucleophilic substitution, ring&#8208;opening, and deprotonation/protonation cascade process. This reaction provides a convenient modular access to pyrrole derivatives with aryl and benzoyl groups through the formation of three new bonds and one heterocycle from readily available acyclic precursors in a single step.

Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Distal C&#63743;H Functionalization of 8&#8208;Aminoquinolinamides: Facile Synthesis of Triarylmethane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manuscript reports a chelation&#8208;induced remote C&#63743;H functionalization of 8&#8208;aminoquinolinamides with p&#8208;quinone methides as alkylating agents. The method enables efficient coupling across diverse quinolinamides, demonstrating broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance.

Herein, a straightforward approach is reported for the palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative remote C&#63743;H alkylation of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline derivatives using para&#8208;quinone methides. This method enables selective C5&#8208;alkylation of quinolines and exhibits a site&#8208;selectivity distinct from that typically observed in convetional palladium&#8208;catalyzed sp2 C&#63743;H activation. The reaction proceeds via chelation&#8208;induced remote C&#63743;H functionalization, and a broad range of quinolinamides are successfully coupled with p&#8208;quinone methides, demonstrating excellent substrate scope and functional group tolerance. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest a reversible C&#63743;H metalation step as part of the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Spiro[3.3]heptane: A Versatile sp3&#8208;Rich Scaffold and its Synthetic Routes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sp3&#8208;rich spiro[3.3]heptane scaffold is a saturated, 3D bioisostere of benzene. This review summarizes key synthetic strategies, including [2+2] cyclizations and bond disconnections at C1&#63743;C2 or C4 (spiro&#8208;carbon) positions, offering a practical guide for accessing this emerging motif and expanding drug&#8208;like chemical space.

Among the growing class of sp3&#8208;rich scaffolds, spiro[3.3]heptane stands out for its rigid, 3D structure and favorable physicochemical properties. Its 3D saturated scaffold enables access to unique, nonplanar chemical space and has been explored as a saturated bioisostere of benzene in drug design. In this review, an overview of synthetic strategies developed to construct spiro[3.3]heptane derivatives is provided. These approaches are grouped according to key synthetic strategies, including formal [2+2] cyclization and bond disconnections at C1&#63743;C2 or C4 (spiro&#8208;carbon) positions. Representative examples are presented to illustrate each method's key transformations and strategic bond formations. This review is intended to support synthetic chemists interested in employing spiro[3.3]heptane as a building block and to provide a foundation for further exploration of this emerging motif.

         <title>Synthesis of Bioorthogonal Mycolic Acids: Chemoselective Reduction of &#946;&#8208;Ketoesters Containing an Alkyne Using the Noyori Catalyst</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal mycolic acids that are suitable probes for the study of the cell envelope of mycobacteria are synthesized by Noyori reduction of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters featuring a protected terminal alkyne. The triisopropylsilyl group is found to be very efficient in preventing the reduction of the alkyne. The prepared compounds will be of great interest for the study of mycomembrane biogenesis.

The asymmetric reduction of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters using the Noyori catalyst is a highly effective synthetic methodology, offering excellent stereocontrol for the preparation of enantiopure &#946;&#8208;hydroxyesters from prochiral substrates in high yields. This reaction has been used in the total synthesis of mycolic acids, which are &#945;&#8208;alkyl, &#946;&#8208;hydroxy fatty acids forming the main part of the mycobacterial cell outer membrane. Recently, the metabolism of mycobacteria has been explored using the chemical reporter strategy with bioorthogonal analogs or precursors of mycolic acids. Introducing a bioorthogonal alkyne into these compounds is a challenging task and particularly valuable for subsequent probe attachment via click chemistry. This work presents approaches for the synthesis of several alkyne&#8208;containing mycolic acids featuring the native structure of natural mycolic acids. The chemoselectivity of the enantioselective reduction of several &#946;&#8208;ketoesters using the Noyori catalyst in the presence of a protected terminal alkyne group is investigated. Conditions have been optimized to ensure that the alkyne remains intact during the reduction process. This study provides valuable tools for further mycomembrane studies using the CuAAC reaction and the optimized conditions extends the possibilities in the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters with an alkyne function.

         <title>A Density Functional Theory&#8208;Genetic Algorithm Approach for the Structural Elucidation of Linear Diamantane Polyesters and their Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diamondoid polyesters emit white light upon continuous infrared laser irradiation. The structures of the polyesters are microcrystalline as determined with solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy combined with computational analyzes.

We report a series of diamantane polyesters synthesized as head&#8208;to&#8208;head and side&#8208;to&#8208;side linear chain polymers. The incorporation of the bulky and rigid diamantyl moiety significantly enhances the thermal stabilities of these polymers compared to well&#8208;established linear aliphatic polyesters, such as poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone), poly(lactic acid), poly(butylene succinate), and poly(glycolic acid). This enhancement is confirmed by thermogravimetric analyzes, which show degradation onsets in the range of 520 to 580&#8201;&#176;C. The structural characterization of these polyesters posed significant challenges due to virtual insolubility in organic solvents, limiting the use of techniques such as mass spectrometry and liquid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. To address these challenges, a genetic algorithm for structure prediction based on periodic density functional theory computations was employed, yielding a structure that closely matches the powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data. Heavily constrained Rietveld refinement provided excellent agreement with the experimental results. These findings, combined with solid&#8208;state NMR data, have been integrated to provide a comprehensive understanding of the polyester properties. These polyesters demonstrate promising nonlinear optical responses, including white&#8208;light emission upon continuous infrared laser irradiation, making them candidates for optoelectronic applications.

         <title>1,2&#8208;Sulfonylative&#8208;Arylation of Acrylamides via Strain&#8208;Release&#8208;/Aromaticity&#8208;Driven Radical Generation and SO2&#8208;Capture under Photoredox Catalysis to Access S(VI)&#8208;Oxindoles</title>

         <dc:description>
1,2&#8208;Sulfonylative&#8208;arylation of N&#8208;phenyl acrylamides has been achieved under visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis conditions. Strained 3&#176;&#8208;cyclopropanols and 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;DHPs are exploited to trigger the acrylamide bisfunctionalization in the presence of SO2 for accessing S(VI) functionalized oxindoles bearing a &#946;&#8208;all&#8208;carbon quaternary center in moderate to good yields.

&#947;&#8208;Keto sulfones, despite being a medicinally relevant building block, have never been integrated with the bioactive oxindole scaffold present in several alkaloid natural products. On the other hand, strategies involving SO2 capture in organic molecules to access value&#8208;added products are gaining momentum. Therefore, a strategy en route to &#947;&#8208;keto alkylsulfonylated oxindoles bearing a &#946;&#8208;all&#8208;carbon quaternary center is disclosed. Toward this goal, the bisfunctionalization of N&#8208;(hetero)arylacrylamides has been realized via the strain&#8208;release driven ring&#8208;scission of strained 3&#176;&#8208;cyclopropanols in the presence of DABSO under visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis to access a library of &#947;&#8208;keto alkylsulfonylated oxindoles. Also, the aromaticity&#8208;driven bond&#8208;scission in pro&#8208;aromatics like 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;DHPs in the presence of Na2S2O5 under visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis has been exploited to trigger the alkylsulfonylative&#8208;arylation of N&#8208;(hetero)arylacrylamides to access a library of alkylsulfonylated oxindoles featuring a &#946;&#8208;all&#8208;carbon quaternary center. Broad substrate scope is demonstrated, and the mechanistic probing studies have been complemented with DFT calculations. Also, moderate to potent cytotoxic activity is observed against the tested triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cell lines for some of the synthesized sulfonylated oxindole derivatives. Further, evaluation of the mechanism of cell death for the most potent oxindole analog revealed that it induces apoptosis in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner.

         <title>A New Paradigm for the Supramolecular Structure of Laterally Offset Diarenes: Polymorphs II of Para&#8208;Substituted Acetophenone Azines, Yp&#63743;Ph&#63743;(Me)C&#63742;N&#63743;N&#63742;C(Me)&#63743;Ph&#63743;Yp (Y&#8201;=&#8201;Cl, Br, CH3)</title>

         <dc:description>
While polymorphs I contain C2&#8208;symmetric enantiomers with pronounced azine twists and disrotatory phenyl twists, the acetophenone azine molecules in the new polymorphs II are Ci&#8208;symmetric with trans azine moieties and conrotatory phenyl twists. The three polymorphs II exemplify the new Paradigm IV for the supramolecular architectures of &#8220;laterally offset diarenes&#8221; and result in &#8220;shiplap/flat&#8221; idioteloamphiphile monolayers (IAMs).

The crystal structures of polymorphs II of acetophenone azines Yp&#63743;Ph&#63743;RC&#63742;N&#63743;N&#63742;CR&#63743;Ph&#63743;Yp with R&#8201;=&#8201;CH3 and Y&#8201;=&#8201;Cl (1M), Br (2M), and CH3 (8M) are discussed. The azine molecules in polymorphs II are Ci&#8208;symmetric with trans&#8208;azine moieties and conrotatory phenyl twists. Polymorphs 1M&#8208;I and 2M&#8208;I contain C2&#8208;symmetric enantiomers with pronounced azine twists and disrotatory phenyl twists and allow for strong lateral double T&#8208;contacts. The three polymorphs II exemplify the new Paradigm IV for the supramolecular architectures of &#8220;laterally offset diarenes&#8221; and result in &#8220;shiplap/flat&#8221; idioteloamphiphile monolayers. Intralayer lateral attraction is provided by edge&#8208;to&#8208;face arene&#8208;arene contacts between molecules with substantial longitudinal offset and involves arene edges bridging one azine&#8208;N and one phenyl center (EAzArB synthon) or one phenyl center and substituent Y (EYArB synthon) of different neighbors. These bridging synthons are characterized by a survey of pertinent structure parameters and their structural significance is corroborated by analysis of distance mapped Hirshfeld surfaces and the computation of 2D&#8208;fingerprint plots. The edge&#8208;to&#8208;face contacts are the most attractive intermolecular interactions, and these interactions are quantified via the computed pair interaction energies and the results of aromatic analyzer analysis. Synthon binding energies and lattice energies are determined to assess polymorph preference energies.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Doped Hydrotalcite: A Heterogeneous Catalyst for the Selective Synthesis of 2&#8208;Substituted Benzimidazoles and Benzothiazoles Using Alcohols and Solvent&#8208;Free Reaction Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;doped calcium aluminium hydrotalcite was synthesised and employed for the selective synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted benzimidazoles and benzothiazoles. The developed protocol uses low oxidation chemicals (alcohols) under solvent&#8208;free reaction conditions, recyclable catalyst and broad substrate scope. Mechanistic study provides an insight into the mechanism of the reaction.

A heterogeneous iron&#8208;anchored calcium aluminum hydrotalcite is prepared and characterized appropriately using powder X&#8208;Ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X&#8208;Ray, transmission electron microscope, ourier&#8208;transform infrared, and thermogravimetric analysis. Further, X&#8208;Ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the presence of Fe in +3 oxidation state. The prepared heterogeneous catalyst is applied to the selective synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted benzimidazole and benzothiazole derivatives using alcohols and under solvent&#8208;free reaction conditions. The developed protocol is applicable to a broad range of substrates, including difficult aliphatic substrates. The Fe/CaAl hydrotalcite catalyst can also be recycled and reused effectively for two catalytic cycles. Furthermore, control experiments reveal the role of the catalyst and the plausible mechanistic pathway of the reaction.

         <title>A Family of Methylene&#8208;Bridged Fully Functionalized Polynitroarenes and Tetrazole&#8208;Based Energetic Materials</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of methylene&#8208;bridged fully functionalized polynitroarenes and tetrazole&#8208;based energetic materials is reported. This approach enables the modification of the energetic properties of polynitroarenes by mono&#8208; and tricationic salt formation.

Herein, to fine&#8208;tune the energetic properties of 2,4,6&#8208;trinitrobenzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;diamine/diol, these are combined with tetrazole via a methylene bridge. This strategy unlocks the tunability of polynitroarenes performances via salt formation, which is restricted in directly C&#63743;N connected polynitroarenes and azole derivatives. The amino/hydroxy functionalities between the nitro groups on the benzene ring provide extensive inter&#8208; and intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions, contributing to improved stability, whereas the tetrazole ring increases the nitrogen percentage and energetic performance. Due to the presence of one and three labile protons in the amino derivative (compounds 4) and hydroxy derivative (compounds 5), respectively, a series of mono&#8208; and tricationic salts are prepared to further fine&#8208;tune the overall performances. Among all the synthesized compounds, the tricationic energetic salt 10 (Dv&#8201;=&#8201;8135&#8201;m&#8201;s&#8722;1, IS&#8201;&gt;&#8201;40&#8201;J) exhibits energetic performance comparable to TATB and is insensitive. All the compounds are characterized through infrared spectroscopy, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, elemental analysis, and high&#8208;resolution mass spectra studies. The relationship between structure and properties is further explored using Hirshfeld surface, noncovalent interaction, Localized Orbital Locator (LOL)&#8208;&#960;, and electrostatic potential analysis.

         <title>The Nonlinear Optical Behavior of Linear Diamantane Polyamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diamondoid&#8208;based polyamides exhibit nonlinear optical properties, namely, they emit white light upon continuous&#8208;wave irradiation with infrared lasers. The use of diamantane monomers significantly enhances the thermal stability of such novel polyamides, thereby opening new avenues for efficient and durable, organic lighting applications.

We report the synthesis and characterization of a new family of single&#8208;component polyamides incorporating rigid diamantane monomers, and investigate their structural, thermal, and nonlinear optical properties. These polymers are largely amorphous and exhibit exceptional thermal stability, with decomposition events in the 400&#8211;600&#8201;&#176;C range, significantly exceeding those of conventional nylons such as nylon&#8208;6 and nylon&#8208;66. Thermal analysis further shows that polyamides containing aromatic units retain higher residual yields than purely aliphatic analogues. Powder X&#8208;Ray diffraction, dynamic light scattering, and scanning electron microscopy reveal pronounced morphological differences, ranging from irregular nanoscale particulates to smooth, rubbery domains. A direct correlation between morphology and optical behavior is observed: polyamides with disordered or finely particulate structures display intrinsic white&#8208;light emission (WLE, 490&#8211;700&#8201;nm, &#955;max&#8201;&#8776;&#8201;610&#8201;nm) under continuous near&#8208;infrared (980&#8201;nm) laser irradiation, whereas the smooth morphology suppresses this response. Importantly, this dopant&#8208;free WLE is unprecedented for polyamides, identifying diamantane&#8208;based polymers as an attractive platform for efficient, thermally robust, and cost&#8208;effective organic light&#8208;emitting materials.

         <title>Discovery of Some New Heterocyclic Systems from Carbene&#8208;Based Reactions of Indigo and N&#8208;Methyl Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accessing new heterocyclic structural space on exposure of indigo&#8208;based substrates to carbene or carbenoid reactive intermediates is the key focus of this work. A number of unprecedented heterocyclic products have been discovered and their structures characterized. Mechanistic comment on the possible cascade processes leading to the products is also presented.

Reactions of N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethylindigo with dichlorocarbene or rhodium carbenoids have been investigated leading to the one&#8208;pot production of new, complex heterocyclic derivatives. One of these arises from an overall ring interconversion process with ring expansion to afford a novel eight&#8208;membered ring&#8208;fused benz[6,7][1,5]oxazocino[3,2&#8208;b]indol&#8208;13&#8208;one derivative. Alternatively, an overall ring construction process gives rise to an unprecedented spirocyclic 2H,4H&#8208;spiro[furo[3,2&#8208;b]indole&#8208;3,2&#8242;&#8208;indoline] system. A number of products with an embedded 6H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;a:3,4&#8208;b&#8242;]diindole core from reaction with a rhodium malonyl ester carbenoid intermediate are also reported, plus some other carbenoid&#8208;derived products. A solvent dependence is apparent with these reactions. Reaction path differences are also seen using N&#8208;methylindigo or the parent indigo as the substrate and possible mechanisms are proposed.

         <dc:description>
Synthesis of 2&#8208;iminothiazolines derived from sulfoxonium ylides is disclosed. The method overcomes current limitation of substrate scope. An array of useful functionalities is tolerated under reaction conditions.

A method is reported which allows for a three&#8208;component cyclization of sulfoxonium ylides, aryl isothiocyanates, and amines to yield 2&#8208;iminothiazolines. The method overcomes the limitation from the scope&#8208;of&#8208;substrate perspective. Success relies on the use of nickel(II) bromide, presumably acting as a Lewis acid catalyst. Investigation of substrate scopes reveals the compatibility of an array of useful functionalities.

         <title>Heavy Atom&#8208;Enhanced Photooxidation Performance of Carbazole&#8208;Substituted BODIPY Dyes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbazole&#8208;substituted halogenated BODIPY dyes exhibit enhanced intersystem crossing and singlet oxygen generation via the heavy&#8208;atom effect, enabling efficient photocatalytic oxidation of 1,5&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene to juglone.

In this study, halogenated BODIPYs (C&#8208;Br2&#8208;BDPY and C&#8208;I2&#8208;BDPY) bearing a carbazole group at the meso position are synthesized and characterized using various spectroscopic techniques. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of the C&#8208;I2&#8208;BDPY revealed that it crystallizes in a triclinic crystal system with a P&#8208;1 space group. The optical properties, singlet oxygen generation capacities, and photocatalytic activities of the BODIPY derivatives are evaluated with respect to juglone synthesis. While the nonhalogenated BODIPY (C&#8208;BDPY) exhibit negligible singlet oxygen generation (&#934;&#916;&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05), the iodinated (C&#8208;I2&#8208;BDPY) and brominated (C&#8208;Br2&#8208;BDPY) derivatives demonstrate considerably higher singlet oxygen quantum yields of 0.82 and 0.73, respectively. In the photooxidation reaction of 1,5&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) to juglone, these halogenated BODIPY compounds achieve conversion yields of 62.6% for C&#8208;Br2&#8208;BDPY and 87.8% for C&#8208;I2&#8208;BDPY within one hour. The turnover number values of the BODIPY photosensitizers show a continuous increase over time, indicating sustained product formation, whereas the turnover frequency values gradually decline, reflecting the decrease in reaction rate as the process progress. Density functional theory calculations support the experimental results by demonstrating that the presence of heavy atoms facilitates intersystem crossing and enhances the thermodynamic feasibility of the photooxidation reactions.

&lt;b&gt;-BDPY&lt;/b&gt;) derivatives demonstrate considerably higher singlet oxygen quantum yields of 0.82 and 0.73, respectively. In the photooxidation reaction of 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) to juglone, these halogenated BODIPY compounds achieve conversion yields of 62.6% for &lt;b&gt;C-Br&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;

&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-BDPY&lt;/b&gt; and 87.8% for &lt;b&gt;C-I&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-BDPY&lt;/b&gt; within one hour. The turnover number values of the BODIPY photosensitizers show a continuous increase over time, indicating sustained product formation, whereas the turnover frequency values gradually decline, reflecting the decrease in reaction rate as the process progress. Density functional theory calculations support the experimental results by demonstrating that the presence of heavy atoms facilitates intersystem crossing and enhances the thermodynamic feasibility of the photooxidation reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ni(OAc)2 Catalyzed N&#8208;Formylation of Primary Sulfonamides Using Carbon Dioxide at Ambient Pressure</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of carbon dioxide as a formyl equivalent toward the N&#8208;formylation of primary sulfonamides has been developed. This Ni(OAc)2 catalyzed protocol employs carbon dioxide under ambient pressure and enables the formylation of aryl, heteroaryl, and alkyl sulfonamides.

A Ni(OAc)2 catalyzed N&#8208;formylation of primary sulfonamides using gaseous carbon dioxide is reported. A range of aromatic, heteroaromatic, and aliphatic sulfonamides are formylated under ambient pressure of carbon dioxide in a closed system. This redox&#8208;neutral method represents a mechanistically novel and operationally convenient method for employing carbon dioxide as a formyl equivalent.

         <title>Stitching &#946;&#8208;Ketothioamides with N&#8208;Tosylbenzoquinone Imine: Transition&#8208;Metal Free Site&#8208;Selective Domino Synthesis of 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;3&#8208;aroyl&#8208;5&#8208;sulfonamide Substituted Benzo[b]furans</title>

Herein, an easy&#8208;to&#8208;access and TM&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step synthesis of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;aroyl&#8208;5&#8208;sulfonamide substituted benzo[b]furans bearing many functional groups of different electronic and steric nature using thioamides and N&#8208;tosylbenzoquinone imine at room temperature in open air is reported for the first time.

Benzofuran derivatives are core components in many biologically active natural and synthetic compounds including approved drugs. Herein, an easy&#8208;to&#8208;access and TM&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step synthesis of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;aroyl&#8208;5&#8208;sulfonamide substituted benzo[b]furans bearing many functional groups of different electronic and steric nature using thioamides (as a 2C synthon) and N&#8208;tosylbenzoquinone imine (as a CCO unit partner) at room temperature in open air is presented for the first time. The reaction proceeds via deprotonation/Michael addition/cyclization/aromatization cascades forming two new (C&#63743;C and C&#63743;O) bonds and one ring, liberating only H2S as a byproduct. High resolution mass spectrometry study endorses the key intermediates involved during reaction, validating excellent regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity. This protocol will not only provide an efficient and scalable method to access diverse benzo[b]furans that could be adaptable to late&#8208;stage functionalization but also enrich the research domain of thioamides.
