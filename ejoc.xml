         <title>Efficient Solution Phase Synthesis of PPII Helix Mimicking Ena/VASP EVH1 Inhibitors from Proline&#8208;Derived Modules (ProMs)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the search for efficient inhibitors for the enabled/ vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein homology 1 (EVH1) domain to reduce cell motility in metastatic cancer, we previously developed a toolkit of proline derived modules (ProMs), which mimic the PPII helix found in the natural &#8208;FPPPP&#8208; binding motif of EVH1. In this work, we describe the modular assembly of these ProM&#8208;based penta&#173;peptidic EVH1 ligands through liquid phase peptide synthesis. We initially used pentafluorophenyl (Pfp) active esters for amide bond formation and built up the growing peptide chain from the C&#8208; to the N&#8208;terminus. Switching to HATU/DIPEA coupling conditions and changing the directionality of the synthesis from the N&#8208; to the C&#8208;terminus afforded the target ligands with improved overall yields and purity. Employing a Fmoc&#8208;protected (instead of the N&#8208;acetylated) phenylalanine derivative as N&#8208;terminal building block significantly reduced epimerization. In contrast to the originally used solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), the developed solution phase method allowed for a facile alteration of the C&#8208;terminal ProM unit and the production of various pentapeptidic ligands in an efficient fashion even on a multigram scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidation of 3&#8208;Oxo&#8208;N&#8208;Confused Porphyrin with PIFA: Inner and meso Functionalizations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugate addition of ethanol to 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;N&#8208;confused tetraphenylporphyrin (ONCP) and subsequent oxidation by [bis (trifluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene (PIFA) lead to the formation of mono&#8208; and di&#8208;ethoxylated ONCP. Interestingly, swapping the addition order of ethanol and PIFA, N&#8208;confused phlorins were obtained.







Abstract
Conjugate addition of ethanol and subsequent oxidation with [bis (trifluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene (PIFA) allowed for the inner ethoxylation of 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;N&#8208;confused tetraphenylporphyrin (ONCP). First oxidation of ONCP with PIFA followed by treatment with ethanol gave two more N&#8208;confused phlorins derivatives 5 and 6.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Cyclobutene&#8208;Annulated Fullerenes through a Cascade Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step method was developed to produce cyclobutenofullerenes via the reaction of fullerene C60 with secondary propargylic phosphates. The reaction cascade comprised the 1,3&#8208;migration of the propargylic phosphate to form an allene intermediate followed by a formal [2+2] cycloaddition with C60, and the subsequent 1,3&#8208;migration and 1,2&#8208;elimination of the phosphodiester moiety.







Abstract
The physicochemical properties of fullerene&#8208;based materials typically vary depending on the type and mode of addition of functional groups; therefore, developing fullerene derivatives with novel structures is imperative for further progress in materials science. In this study, we develop an efficient one&#8208;step strategy for synthesizing cyclobutene&#8208;annulated fullerene derivatives (cyclobutenofullerenes) and characterize their electronic properties. Despite the steric strain, cyclobutenofullerenes can be easily prepared via a one&#8208;step reaction of C60 with a secondary propargylic phosphate. Structural analysis of the reaction intermediates suggests that the cascade reaction proceeds through a formal [2+2] cycloaddition of C60 with an allene, caused by the 1,3&#8208;migration of the propargylic phosphate, followed by an additional 1,3&#8208;migration and the subsequent 1,2&#8208;elimination of the phosphodiester moiety.

         <title>Synthesis of Flavones through NaI&#8208;Mediated Electrochemical Cyclization of Chalcones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we demonstrated a novel electrochemical oxidative cyclization for synthesis of flavone from 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxychalcone using an inexpensive using low toxic NaI as mediator/electrolyte without external additives in EtOH/water solvent. The key features of this reaction include its broad substrate scope, scalability, ability to operate with benign solvent at room temperature, and no requirement of strong oxidizing agent and external additive.







Abstract
A mild electrochemical oxidative cyclization for the synthesis of flavones from easy&#8208;access 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxychalcones was developed using an inexpensive NaI as mediator and electrolyte under ambient temperature in a mixture of EtOH and H2O as solvent. This method was successfully applied to synthesize 26 examples of flavones from a variety of functionalized 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxychalcones. A gram&#8208;scale formal synthesis of bioactive scutellarein was successfully demonstrated. Control experiments were conducted to disclose a possible indirect oxidation via in&#8197;situ generation of iodine. The main advantages of this reaction include its broad substrate scope, scalability, ability to operate with benign solvent, and no requirement for strong oxidizing agents and external additives.

         <title>Electrochemical Direct C&#8722;H Halogenation of N&#8208;Heteroarenes and Naphthols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we introduce an environmentally friendly and highly efficient electrochemical method for regioselective C&#8722;H halogenation of (hetero)arenes, achieving moderate to excellent yields in an undivided cell. This approach demonstrates remarkable performance across a wide range of substrates.







Abstract
In this study, we present a straightforward and environmentally friendly electrochemical approach for achieving selective halogenation of N&#8208;heteroarenes, including indoles, diazoles, pyrroles, quinolinone, and naphthols. Our method utilizes commercially available and affordable ammonium halides as halogen source. A library of valuable halogenated N&#8208;heteroarenes can be synthesized in moderate to excellent yields under mild conditions (transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, oxidant&#8208;free, ethanol as solvent, atmospheric environment). The approach demonstrates a broad substrate scope, excellent tolerance towards various functional groups, and scalability.

This approach demonstrates remarkable performance across a wide range of substrates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we present a straightforward and environmentally friendly electrochemical approach for achieving selective halogenation of N-heteroarenes, including indoles, diazoles, pyrroles, quinolinone, and naphthols. Our method utilizes commercially available and affordable ammonium halides as halogen source. A library of valuable halogenated N-heteroarenes can be synthesized in moderate to excellent yields under mild conditions (transition-metal-free, oxidant-free, ethanol as solvent, atmospheric environment). The approach demonstrates a broad substrate scope, excellent tolerance towards various functional groups, and scalability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dioxygen&#8208;Triggered &#946;&#8208;Hydroxysulfonylation of Terminal Olefins Controlled by DABCO</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein described a dioxygen&#8208;triggered &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfonylation of unactivated olefins. The selectivity of the reaction is controlled by DABCO, which acts as a single electron transfer reagent in the reaction. This strategy has the advantages of being metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free, clean, safe, with readily available unactivated olefin as the substrate, low cost, easy to perform, high atomic efficiency, and not sensitive to air.







Abstract
A dioxygen&#8208;triggered selectively difunctionalization of olefins to achieve &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfones has been developed. Particularly, the mechanism of this reaction can be controlled by DABCO, which act as a single electron transfer reagent, to selectively obtain ketosulfone or hydroxysulfone. The reaction was conducted in a clean, safe, mild, and catalyst&#8208;free conditions. Moreover, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, two bioactive molecules were synthesized easily using this method.

         <title>2&#8208;Ketophenyl Assisted Biomimetic Synthesis of 3&#8208;Thio Substituted Glycals at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we have described a synthesis of 3&#8208;thiosugars stereoselectively from 2&#8208;ketoglycals via regioselective displacement of C3 ester group with inversion of configuration. This strategy tolerates well with a variety of substituted thiophenols, aliphatic cyclic thiols, and mercaptans.







Abstract
Herein we designed a strategy for the synthesis of regioselective and stereoselective displacement of C&#8208;3 acetate group in the presence of other C&#8208;4 and C&#8208;6 acetate of 2&#8208;ketophenyl&#8208;glycal by different aromatic and cyclic aliphatic thiol nucleophiles taking inspiration from cytosolic esterase mediated thiolation of glucosamine sugars into cellular glycan. Under a mild base condition at room temperature, the protocol generated a library of 3&#8208;arylthiosugars with excellent yields and high axial selectivity. This stereoselective approach tolerated well with different ester&#8208;protected glycals and thiophenols, aliphatic cyclic thiols, and mercaptans. A variety of control experiments were conducted to establish the mechanism and reason behind the stereoselectivity.

An efficient enantioselective palladium&#8208;catalyzed trifluoromethylated allylic alkylation of N&#8208;substituted glycine ethyl esters using &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)alkenyl acetates as trifluoromethyl&#8208;containing allyl precursors is established. A series of optically active glycine ethyl ester derivatives containing a trifluoromethylated allyl substituent are readily synthesized in good yields with superior enantioselectivities.







Abstract
An efficient strategy for asymmetric trifluoromethylated allylic alkylation of easily available N&#8208;substituted glycine ethyl esters with &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)alkenyl acetates has been developed. Catalyzed by a [Pd(C3H5)Cl]2/(R)&#8208;BINAP, various trifluoromethyl&#8208;containing N&#8208;substituted glycine ethyl ester derivatives are afforded with good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. The product can be readily converted into diverse fluoro&#8208;substituted species, which shows the practicability of this method.

         <title>Pyramidalization at the sp2&#8208;Hybridized ipso&#8208;Carbon Atom of Phenyl Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In toluene, ethylbenzene, and t&#8208;butylbenzene the sp2&#8208;hybridized center at the ipso&#8208;carbon atom of the phenyl ring is pyramidalizing on rotation about the bond phenyl&#8208;substituent. A comparison of structures with pyramidalization and its hypothetical counterparts without pyramidalization shows that pyramidalization is associated with a gain of energy on the basis of DFT calculations and a scatter plot analysis of 14,169 structures of ethylbenzene derivatives.







Abstract
In this study we investigate the pyramidalization of the sp2&#8208;hybridized center at the ipso&#8208;carbon atom Ci of phenyl compounds on the theoretical side by DFT calculations of toluene, t&#8208;butylbenzene, and ethylbenzene and on the experimental side by a scatter plot analysis of 14,169 structures of ethylbenzene compounds C&#946;&#8722;C&#945;H2&#8722;C6H5 with three open positions for variation at C&#946;, accumulated in the Cambridge Structural Database. In a 360&#176; rotation about the bond between C&#945; of the substituent and the ipso&#8208;carbon atom Ci of the phenyl ring, the pyramidalization performs three maxima and minima. A comparison of structures with pyramidalization and its hypothetical counterparts without pyramidalization shows that pyramidalization is associated with a gain of energy. The data reveal that it is the carbon atom C&#945; of the phenyl substituent, which on pyramidalization bends away from the phenyl plane. Pyramidalization of sp2&#8208;hybridized centers is an omnipresent member in molecular weak interactions.

The data reveal that it is the carbon atom C&lt;sub&gt;&#945;&lt;/sub&gt; of the phenyl substituent, which on pyramidalization bends away from the phenyl plane. Pyramidalization of sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridized centers is an omnipresent member in molecular weak interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Organocatalysts in Enantioselective CO2 Utilization Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 32, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept summarizes recent advances in catalytic enantioselective CO2 utilization reactions using chiral organocatalysts.







Abstract
The development of efficient CO2 utilization reactions has gained a significant amount of attention in recent years. Although transformations of CO2 to produce basic chemicals have been extensively investigated, the development of catalytic enantioselective CO2 utilization reactions for the preparation of fine chemicals remains limited at this stage. Several excellent methods for catalytic enantioselective CO2 utilization using chiral metal complex catalysts have been reported. Many researchers have also focused on developing organocatalyzed approaches to enantioselective CO2 utilization, and several excellent examples have appeared in recent years. Herein, recent advances in catalytic enantioselective CO2 utilization reactions using chiral organocatalysts are reviewed to provide a forecast for organocatalyzed enantioselective CO2 utilization research.

         <title>Rhodium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Selective C(sp3)&#8722;H Amination of Alkanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 32, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H amination with sulfamates allows to functionalize alkanes used as the limiting component, selectively at tertiary centers. Valuable nitrogen&#8208;containing building blocks can be isolated in good to excellent yields.







Abstract
The development of an efficient catalytic system enabling the conversion of alkanes to valuable nitrogen&#8208;containing building blocks is reported. Light alkanes can be selectively functionalized by an intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H amination reaction that proceeds at room temperature in the presence of only 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of a dirhodium(II) complex. Selective amination of tertiary C(sp3)&#8722;H within acyclic or cyclic alkanes used as limiting components leads to the corresponding amides isolated with yields in the 51&#8211;96&#8201;% range. The reaction, that can be performed on a gram&#8208;scale, applies with equal levels of efficiency and selectivity to more complex hydrocarbons.

         <title>Blue&#8208;LED Synthesis of Pummerer's Ketones by Peroxidase&#8208;Lignin&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Coupling of Substituted Phenols</title>

         <dc:description>
Horseradish peroxidase activated by hydroperoxide of 2&#8208;MeTHF catalyzes the synthesis of Pummerer's Ketones under blue&#8208;LED Photon irradiation in the presence of meso&#8208;TPP. Lignin nanoparticles worked as an electroactive platform in improving the activity of the enzyme.







Abstract
Pummerer's ketones resembling the tricyclic scaffold of bioactive natural substances were synthesized by blue&#8208;LED driven Horseradish Peroxidase oxidative coupling of substituted phenols in 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran by using meso&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin as photosensitizer and dioxygen as primary oxidant. The application of functionalized lignin nanoparticles as a renewable and efficient platform for the immobilization of the enzyme extended the effectiveness of the overall process to heterogeneous catalysis under buffer limiting conditions.

A metal&#8208;free PhI(OAc)2&#8208;mediated oxyacetoxylation of arylynamines and ynamides to provide &#945;&#8208;acetoxyl amides highly regio&#8208; and chemoselectively in good to excellent yields, leaving the N&#8208;heteroaryl rings intact, is reported.







Abstract
Ynamides/arylynamines are challenging substrates for oxyacetoxylation, especially due to various reactive sites of the N&#8208;heteroaryl ring. Herein, we report a metal&#8208;free PhI(OAc)2&#8208;mediated oxyacetoxylation of arylynamines/ynamides to provide &#945;&#8208;acetoxyl amides in good to excellent yields. The transformation completes in a short time to afford solely the product in a highly regio&#8208; and chemo&#8208;selective manner through &#946;&#8208;iodo keteneiminium intermediate, without functionalising the N&#8208;heteroaryl moiety.

         <title>PCCP&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Tetrasubstituted Allenes Bearing Heteroaromatic Sulfenyl Group
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 32, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple, one&#8208;step Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed reaction of propargyl alcohol derivatives with heterocyclic thiols was performed with the aid of pentacarboxycyclopenatadiene (PCCP) catalyst. This reported approach provides an access to tetrasubstituted allenes substituted with heterocyclic thioethers in good to excellent yield under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
We report a Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of tetrasubstituted allenyl compounds decorated with heterocyclic sulfenyl group. The reaction proceeds readily from available propargylic alcohols in the presence of pentacarboxycyclopenatadienes (PCCPs) as organocatalysts. The developed strategy provides tetrasubstituted allene derivatives in high yields (from 55 to 98&#8201;%) and under mild reaction conditions.

A transition metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot procedure for the difunctionalization of alkynes has been developed.







Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot procedure for the difunctionalization of alkynes by C&#8722;C triple bond oxidation and transformation towards chromone derivatives has been developed. It involves cascade reactions for carbonylation of alkynes, base&#8208;promoted C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bond cleavage, and intramolecular cyclization. This procedure provides an efficient protocol for the synthesis of polysubstituted chromones from readily available starting materials.

         <dc:description>
The enantioselective addition of difluoroenoxysilanes to aromatic aldehydes, catalyzed by cationic palladium aqua complexes, is described. The reaction is operationally simple, does not require anhydrous conditions and performs at room temperature. The aldol compounds were obtained in good yields and with enantiomeric ratios up to 93&#8201;:&#8201;7.







Abstract
The enantioselective addition of difluoroenoxysilanes to aromatic aldehydes, catalyzed by cationic palladium aqua complexes, has been described. The reaction is operationally simple, does not require anhydrous conditions and performs at room temperature. The palladium catalysts, previously discovered and reported by Sodeoka, are easily prepared in two steps from PdCl2(MeCN)2. The aldol compounds were obtained in good yields and with enantiomeric ratios up to 93&#8201;:&#8201;7, the reaction being more efficient using electron&#8208;rich aldehydes.

         <title>Electrochemical Asymmetric Diacetoxylation of Styrenes Mediated by Chiral Iodoarene Catalyst
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 32, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, an asymmetric electrosynthetic reaction mediated by a catalytic amount of chiral iodoarene has been accomplished. Important aspects of the design of such transformations are disclosed, providing guidance for the development of novel enantioselective iodoarene&#8208;catalyzed processes promoted electrochemically.







Abstract
Organocatalysis with chiral iodoarenes has emerged as a powerful approach for performing enantioselective transformations. However, it suffers from the need to utilize stoichiometric amounts of peroxy acids or similar high energy oxidants. Electrosynthesis enables eliminating stoichiometric redox reagents by replacing them with electric stimuli. In this context, an electrochemically&#8208;promoted variant of the chiral iodoarene&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric diacetoxylation of styrenes was evaluated. The screening of reaction parameters established a set of conditions under which, for the first time, an enantioselective electrochemical oxidation mediated by a chiral iodoarene achieving a catalytic turnover has been accomplished. The reaction was applied for the synthesis of an array of products in 15&#8211;60&#8201;% yields and 0&#8211;84&#8201;% ee. The modest efficiency of the electrocatalysis was traced to a partial direct oxidation of styrene substrates leading to racemic products and undesired dimeric side&#8208;products. Cyclic voltammetry measurements demonstrated that such outcome originates from a somewhat difficult electrochemical oxidation of the applied iodoarene catalyst. Present work provides important insights and implications for the design of more efficient electrocatalytic systems employing chiral iodoarenes as mediators.

         <title>Reductive Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig Amination of Nitroarenes with Aryl (pseudo)Halides</title>

         <dc:description>
A de novo catalytic syntheses of diarylamines from a palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination of nitroarenes with aryl (pseudo)halides is developed. The use of upstream nitroarenes as arylamine surrogates, the judicious selection of bis(pinaco&#8208;lato)diboron (B2pin2) as a stoichiometric reducing agent, wide substrate scope including (hetero)aryl halides (Cl, Br and I) and aryl triflates, constitute the striking features of this protocol.







Abstract
De novo catalytic syntheses of diarylamines from a palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination of nitroarenes with aryl (pseudo)halides is described. The exquisite use of upstream nitroarenes as arylamine surrogates, the judicious selection of bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2) as a stoichiometric reducing agent, and wide substrate scope including (hetero)aryl halides (Cl, Br and I) and aryl triflates, constitute the striking features of the current protocol. Moreover, application of this technique to the syntheses of advanced intermediates and active pharmaceutical ingredients also proved successful, thus providing an alternative step&#8208;economical approach to the syntheses of diarylamine&#8208;incorporated molecules. Preliminary mechanistic investigation demonstrates that an amine and a nitrosoarene intermediates might be involved in this reductive event.

         <title>Elucidating the Mechanism and Chemoselectivity in the PBu3&#8208;Catalyzed Rauhut&#8208;Currier Reaction of Chalcone with Ethyl Acrylate</title>

         <dc:description>
The mechanism and origins of regioselectivity and chemoselectivity of phosphine&#8208;catalyzed cross Rauhut&#8208;Currier reaction of chalcone with ethyl acrylate have been theoretically investigated.







Abstract
Disclosing the chemoselectivity and regioselectivity of phosphine&#8208;catalyzed Rauhut&#8208;Currier (R&#8722;C) reaction remains a challenge. Here, a comprehensive study on the possible mechanisms and origins of the chemoselectivity and regioselectivity of PBu3&#8208;catalyzed R&#8722;C reactions between ethyl acrylate and chalcone is performed by DFT. Both cross and homo R&#8722;C reactions are investigated and compared. The computational results show that the cross R&#8722;C reaction is energetically favorable than the homo R&#8722;C reaction, with head&#8208;to&#8208;tail product being generated preferentially. Moreover, the C&#8722;C bond formation process is identified to be the regioselectivity&#8208; and chemoselectivity&#8208;determining step. The CDFT and Parr function analyses are successfully used to predict the origins of chemoselectivity and regioselectivity, respectively. This work would provide a valuable case for exploring the origins of the chemoselectivity and regioselectivity of the phosphine catalyzed reactions, which should be helpful to understand and control the selectivities by rational design.

         <title>Mannich&#8208;Type Reactions of Alkylzinc Reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 32, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of alkylzinc halides to imines has been studied under different conditions. Whereas Mannich&#8208;type reactions with sulfonyl imines occurs upon simple heating, the use N&#8208;alkyl imines required an additional activation: the use of acetyl chloride led to the preparation of N&#8208;acyl tertiary amines whereas trimethylsilyl chloride afforded a direct access to unprotected secondary amines.

Mannich&#8208;type reactions involving alkylzinc reagents have been developed using different strategies. We show that the addition of these organometallic species to sulfonyl imines occurs upon simple heating and affords Mannich products in moderate to excellent yields (14 examples, 30&#8211;99&#8201;%). Interestingly, N&#8208;alkyl imines were also found to be suitable partners after activation as an acyliminium by acetyl chloride (12 examples, 49&#8211;86&#8201;%) or, more originally, by TMSCl (14 examples, 26&#8211;87&#8201;%). These methods proved complementary, leading to the preparation of both N&#8208;protected secondary or tertiary amines and N&#8208;unprotected secondary amines in good yields, with an increased eco&#8208;compatibility, and under simple conditions.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed C5&#8208;Regioselective Esterification of Dienyl Alcohols with Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 26, Issue 32, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here reported a C5&#8208;regioselective esterification of unactivated dienyl alcohols using free carboxylic acids as nucleophiles under mild conditions. The process provided a series of 1,3&#8208;dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;ester compounds in excellent regioselectivity and E&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
One&#8208;step process for the preparation of a 1,3&#8208;dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;ester motif from readily available substrate remains a challenging work in organic synthesis. We herein report the first example of C5&#8208;regioselective esterification of unactivated dienyl alcohols, using free carboxylic acids as nucleophiles under mild conditions, providing a series of 1,3&#8208;dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;ester compounds in excellent regioselectivity and E&#8208;selectivity.

The divergent synthesis of dihydropyrimidouracil and pyrimidouracil derivatives from N&#8208;uracil amidines and tertiaryamines by an oxidative C(sp3)&#8722;N cleavage cascade cyclization reaction is first described.







Abstract
The divergent synthesis of dihydropyrimidouracil and pyrimidouracil derivatives from N&#8208;uracil amidines and tertiaryamines by an oxidative C(sp3)&#8722;N cleavage cascade cyclization reaction is first described. This transformation enables the formation of new C(sp3)&#8722;N and C(sp2)&#8722;N bonds via the selection of different oxidation conditions. The features of this method include tunable product selectivity, excellent chemoselectivity, readily available starting materials, broad substrate scope, good tolerance of functional groups, and moderate to high yields.

This Review reports metal containing heterogeneous catalytic systems for the transformations of aromatic amines to azo compounds hydrazines and 2H&#8208;indzoles.







Abstract
The most significant task in synthetic organic chemistry is developing organic reactions from a green and sustainable perspective. In these ways, heterogeneous catalysts are essential in many organic reactions. Thus, this study focuses on the synthesis of N&#8722;N bond bearing organic frameworks, particularly aromatic azo compounds and indazoles, using a heterogeneous metal catalyst. Organic molecules containing nitrogen&#8208;nitrogen bonds are greatly sought after in the synthesis of dyes, photochemical switches, food additives, and bioactive chemicals due to industry and human requirements. Finally, this review provides an overview of synthetic routes for the formation of N&#8722;N bonds by using various heterogeneous metal catalytic systems.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The significance of cross dehydrogenative couplings has increased considerably in recent years. This article revisits the [3+2]&#8208; C&#8722;C/N&#8722;C, C&#8722;C/O&#8722;C and C&#8722;C/C&#8722;C annulation strategy, recently reported by our group, according to a Pd(II) catalyzed dehydrogenative variant. Our original report relied on Pd(0) catalysis, using &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated&#8208;&#947;&#8208;oxy carbonyls as bis&#8208;electrophiles and resonance&#8208;stabilized acetamides or 3&#8208;oxoglutarates as C/N and O/C or C/C bis&#8208;nucleophiles, respectively. In this more modern and straightforward Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative approach, &#946;,&#947;unsaturated carbonyl derivatives replace &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated&#8208;&#947;&#8208;oxy carbonyls as bis&#8208;electrophiles. Our study includes experimental optimization and showcases the synthetic versatility in the formation of diverse heterocyclic structures, such as bicyclic lactams, furocycloalkanones and bicycloalkane&#8208;diones. Furthermore, a mechanism is proposed to elucidate the underlying processes involved in these reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Catalytic Synthesis of Optically Active Drug (S)&#8208;Clopidogrel</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A first catalytic preparation of the popular antiplatelet drug (S)&#8208;clopidogrel, known with the tradename of Plavix, has been developed in a one&#8208;pot innovative approach. The synthesis can be performed using commercially available ortho&#8208;chlorobenzaldehyde, 1&#8208;naphthylsulfonyl acetonitrile, tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP), 4,5,6,7&#8208;tetrahydrothieno[3,2&#8208;c]pyridine and 20 mol% of a quinidine derived organocatalyst in a single solvent. A Knoevenagel/asymmetric epoxidation/domino ring&#8208;opening esterification (DROE) sequence enabled to obtain (S)&#8208;clopidogrel in 61% overall yield and 62% ee. Fine optimization of the reaction conditions proved to be crucial to set up a selective and efficient process</dc:description>

A series of allyl alcohol substituted 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;H&#8208;indazoles were obtained with broad functional groups tolerance and favourable stereoselectivity.

         <dc:description>A mild and straightforward access to various substituted naphthalene&#8208;fused oxepines from readily available Donor&#8208;Acceptor (D&#8208;A) cyclobutanes is reported. This method involves the Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions of D&#8208;A cyclobutanes with 2&#8208;naphthols to afford ring&#8208;opened products, which can undergo intramolecular cyclization mediated by the NBS&#8208;base system to yield corresponding naphthalene&#8208;fused oxepines. The cyclization protocol involves a nucleophilic attack of the oxygen of 2&#8208;naphthol on the newly formed electrophilic acceptor end of D&#8208;A cyclobutane.</dc:description>

         <title>Second&#8208;Generation Total Synthesis of the Pigment Aurantricholone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Our first total synthesis of aurantricholone established its benzotropolone core by the ring&#8208;enlargement of a tetralone. Here we describe another total synthesis of aurantricholone. It reaches the benzotropolone core from a known olefin metathesis product via an equally known dibromide, both of which contain a ketoketal moiety. The next transformation &#8722; step 9 overall &#8722; engaged this motif in a &#946;&#8208;elimination of ROH rather than in another hydrolysis under the forcing acidic conditions indispensable in all prior benzotropolone preparations from such an intermediate. In step 10, the Csp2&#8722;Br bonds of the elimination product underwent two doubly Z&#8208;selective Suzuki couplings with a boronylated O&#8208;methyl 4&#8208;methylidenetetronate. This gave penta(O&#8208;methyl)aurantricholone. Its NMR shifts matched essentially those of a derivative of natural aurantricholone by Steglich et al. Three O&#8722;Me bonds were cleaved with BBr3/CH2Cl2 (step 11) and two O&#8722;Me bonds with LiBr/DMF (step 12). A 1:1 co&#8208;crystal of aurantricholone and DMSO allowed for an X&#8208;ray structure analysis.</dc:description>

Abstract
An efficient and straightforward methodology for the synthesis of 1,2,2&#8208;triarylethanones and 2,2&#8208;diarylethanones has been developed, via a visible light&#8208;promoted/Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed carbonyl&#8208;alkyne metathesis/transfer hydrogenation one&#8208;pot reaction of benzoquinone, arylalkyne, and Hantzsch ester. A series of synthetically useful triarylethanones and diarylethanones were achieved in excellent yield under mild reaction conditions. This protocol is operationally simple, photocatalyst&#8208;free, and scalable and has a broad substrate scope. Moreover, this reaction involves the formation of three chemical bonds, namely C=O, C&#8722;C, and C&#8722;H bonds. This feature enables de novo synthesis of 1,2,2&#8208;triarylethanones and 2,2&#8208;diarylethanones. Additionally, this protocol provides a convenient and practical synthetic route for tamoxifen.

         <title>Molecular Turnstiles Featuring Bicyclic Rotators: Solution and Solid&#8208;State Investigation of Steric and Electronic Concerns</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bicyclic rotators connected to rigid stators provide opportunities to study rotational movement via 1H&#8197;NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy. Solution studies suggest rotation or wobbling of the central arene with respect to the rigid stator. Similar motion in the solid&#8208;state may be limited by intermolecular attractions between neighboring compounds.







Abstract
A molecular rotor is created when a 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole rotator is incorporated into a rigid arylene ethynylene framework supported by pyridine coordination to a metal (Ag+ or PdCl2) guest. Comparisons to a similarly sized naphthyl rotator via 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy provide insights into the movement of these bicyclic rotators relative to the rigid stator framework.

     alt="Molecular Turnstiles Featuring Bicyclic Rotators: Solution and Solid-State Investigation of Steric and Electronic Concerns"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bicyclic rotators connected to rigid stators provide opportunities to study rotational movement via &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR, X-ray crystallography, and UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy. Solution studies suggest rotation or wobbling of the central arene with respect to the rigid stator. Similar motion in the solid-state may be limited by intermolecular attractions between neighboring compounds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A molecular rotor is created when a 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole rotator is incorporated into a rigid arylene ethynylene framework supported by pyridine coordination to a metal (Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or PdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) guest. Comparisons to a similarly sized naphthyl rotator via &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy provide insights into the movement of these bicyclic rotators relative to the rigid stator framework. Chemical shift increases of 0.3&#8197;ppm, or more, upon metal complexation are consistent with through-space interaction of the central arene with a bound PdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; guest. Further study via X-ray crystallography illustrates that rotation of the 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole unit in the solid state is likely hampered by relatively strong chalcogen bonding (N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S distance of 2.93&#8197;&#197;), forming 2S-2N squares between benzothiadiazoles of neighboring complexes. Strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions (3.29&#8211;3.36&#8197;&#197;) between neighboring complexes likewise restrict solid-state rotation of the potential benzothiadiazole rotator. Modest changes to UV&#8211;vis spectra upon metal coordination suggest that electronic properties are mostly independent of stator configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Pyran&#8208;4&#8208;ones with unique substitution pattern can be accessed via regioselective 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization of 1&#8208;[O]&#8208;enynones; mechanistic explanations were proposed. Thiation and desilylation of TMS&#8208;substituted pyranones can be easily performed.







Abstract
Exclusive formation of 5&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;trimethylsilyl&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran&#8208;4&#8208;ones is accomplished by a regioselective cyclization of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;ethoxy(hydroxy)&#8208;5&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)pent&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;3&#8208;ones. This cyclization occurs in a 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig mode through addition to the &#946;&#8208;atom of the TMS substituted triple bond. The reaction was found to be general for a range of ethoxyenynones upon heating in glacial acetic acid and for analogous hydroxyenynones in diphenyl ether. Plausible mechanistic explanation and possible post&#8208;modifications of resulting pyranones are offered.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefination has been lately often used in the preparation of trisubstituted alkenes which serve as precursors of natural products and their analogs as well of pharmaceutically interesting/biologically important compounds. Significant observations regarding the stereoselectivity of those reactions are described in this reviewing work covering comprehensively the period 2016&#8211;2022.







Abstract
Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefination, a coupling reaction between a carbonyl component and a sulfone partner, has emerged as a powerful synthetic tool in the preparation of several organic compounds. A number of interesting examples involving particularly the preparation of trisubstituted alkenes along with important observations regarding the stereoselectivity of those reactions have been recently reported. This reviewing work covers the literature for the period 2016&#8211;2022 and describes in a comprehensive way the progress and developments of Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefination application in the synthesis of trisubstituted alkenes which serve as precursors of natural products and their analogs as well of pharmaceutically interesting/biologically important compounds. Moreover, key methodology results dealing with the investigation of the optimum conditions and stereoselectivities and new modifications and approaches are discussed.

         <title>Synthesis of Berkeleylactone A by Ring&#8208;Closing Alkyne Metathesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using some straightforward alkyne chemistry and an asymmetric dihydroxylation on a dienoate, the substrate for a ring&#8208;closing alkyne metathesis (RCAM) was assembled in a few steps. After semihydrogenation of the triple bond, the resulting macrolactone was converted to berkeleylactone A through acetal hydrolysis, allylic oxidation, thia&#8208;Michael addition, hydrogenation, and ester hydrolysis. The 8,9&#8208;didehydro analog was also prepared.







Abstract
A new route to the macrolactone antibiotic berkeleylactone A was developed. As a key step, a ring&#8208;closing alkyne metathesis (RCAM) of an ester substrate featuring 1&#8208;propynyl termini was used. The carboxylic part of the substrate was easily assembled using alkyne chemistry, like carboxylation of a diyne followed by isomerization of the ynoate section to a dienoate and dihydroxylation of the 4,5&#8208;double bond. The synthesis of the alcohol part of the ester started with opening of (R)&#8208;propylene oxide with an acetylide and was followed by two triple bond migrations. After successful RCAM which formed the C8&#8722;C9 bond, the triple bond was selectively hydrogenated to the corresponding alkene before the 4,5&#8208;diol was oxidized to the 5&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;oxo derivative. At this stage, the thioether was formed and the 8,9&#8208;double bond reduced. We also prepared the 8,9&#8208;didehydro analog of berkeleylactone A. However, it turned out that its antimicrobial activity was slightly reduced.

         <title>Organophotocatalyzed Synthesis of Vinyl&#8208;SCF3 and Benzoyl&#8208;SCF3 Using a New N&#8208;(SCF3)(CF3)&#8208;Shelf&#8208;Stable Reagent</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unprecedented use of PhPhN(SCF3)(CF3) as an efficient reagent for the formation of C&#8722;SCF3 bond under photoredox conditions is reported. The organophotocatalyst could be used in conjunction with bromine as an activator or in the presence of FAT catalyst for the synthesis of vinyl&#8208;SCF3 and benzoyl&#8208;SCF3. Moreover, preliminary mechanistic investigation including EPR spectroscopy allow us to identify key radicals in the reactions processes.







Abstract
We report the photocatalyzed C&#8722;SCF3 bond formation using a new shelf&#8208;stable PhPh&#8208;N&#8208;(SCF3)(CF3) reagent I in combination with 4CzIPN as organophotocatalyst under blue LED irradiation. While the synthesis of vinyl&#8208;SCF3 is performed in the presence of bromide salts as an activator of reagent I, the synthesis of trifluoromethylthioesters was undertaken using aldehydes as starting material in the presence of a hydrogen atom transfer catalyst (HAT). Preliminary mechanistic investigations including EPR spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry analysis shed the light on the reaction mechanisms.

         <dc:description>An efficient copper(II) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex with an NCN coordination mode was optimized to catalyze the Chan&#8211;Evans&#8208;Lam (CEL) cross&#8208;coupling reaction of imidazole and other N&#8208;heterocyclic nucleophiles with arylboronic acid. This air&#8208;stable copper catalyst shows robust catalytic performance and tolerates a diverse array of functional groups on both the N&#8208;nucleophile and arylboronic acid coupling partners in C&#8211;N bond forming reactions through the CEL reaction with up to 95% yield. Formation of the Cu&#8208;NHC complex in situ generated similar catalytic performance for CEL coupling. Alternative metal ions (Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Ru2+, and Pd2+) were also screened in the presence of the NHC precursor as CEL catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Difluoromethoxylated Ketones as Building Blocks for the Synthesis of Challenging OCF2H&#8208;Bearing N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles bearing the Emerging Fluorinated Group &#8722;OCF2H is herein disclosed. Various difluoromethoxylated pyrazoles, isoxazoles, pyrimidines and indoles were thus quickly and easily obtained. These new structures of high value were accessed from simple &#945;&#8208;(difluoromethoxy)ketones as versatile building blocks in a one&#8208;pot process.







Abstract
We report herein an unprecedented synthesis of difluoromethoxylated nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles from the corresponding &#945;&#8208;(difluoromethoxy)ketones as versatile building blocks. Pyrazoles, isoxazoles and pyrimidines could be obtained via an enaminone intermediate, whereas in the direct reaction of &#945;&#8208;(difluoromethoxy)ketones with arylhydrazines, a Fischer indole synthesis was achieved. All these scaffolds, which are uncommon, or even sometimes novel, due to the directly attached emerging fluorinated group (EFG) &#8722;OCF2H, might be of high potential in life sciences and appear as an interesting alternative to more and more controversial classical fluorinated groups, such as the ubiquitous trifluoromethyl group.

         <title>Synthesis and Chiroptical Properties of Binaphthyl&#8208;Hinged [5]Helicenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel [5]helicene linked by binaphthyl was prepared as a chiroptical dye exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence. The rigid [5]helicene exhibits higher glum values (6.0&#8211;6.8&#215;10&#8722;3) than unlocked helicenes. This is attributed to the C2 structure in the excited state, where the magnetic and electric transition dipole moments are parallel.







Abstract
The synthesis, structure, and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of two types of shape&#8208;persistent [5]helicenes, hinged by a tethered (&#8722;OCH2CH2O&#8722;) or untethered (&#8722;OCH3) binaphthyl, are reported. The binaphthyl tethering system facilitated an effective Wittig ring&#8208;closure reaction in the synthesis of a macrocyclic precursor, which could be easily converted to the title compound via successive photocyclization. The tethered groups were replaced with untethered &#8722;OCH3 groups by treatment with BBr3 followed by methylation. Both compounds exhibited similar spectra, and their longest wavelength absorption band with a low intensity was attributed to the transition from HOMO to LUMO+1. These compounds exhibited CPL with higher dissymmetry factors glum values than unlocked helicenes.

         <dc:description>The dearomative spirocyclisation of benzisoxazoles through a radical chain mechanism is described. Densely functionalised spirocycles were prepared in high yields by reacting benzisoxazole&#8208;tethered ynones with aryl thiols in 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane (DCE) at 60 &#176;C. The identification of stabilising three&#8208;electron interactions was key to the development of this new radical cascade reaction. The obtained spirocyclic products were converted into other spirocyclic scaffolds through a two&#8208;step hydrogenolysis&#8208;cyclisation sequence.</dc:description>

         <title>Ring Transformation of &#945;&#8208;Amino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoesters to &#948;&#8208;Butyrolactams</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#948;&#8208;Butyrolactams with an exocyclic ester moiety in the &#948;&#8208;position were accessed by reduction of 1&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;cyclopentanone carboxylates with PBu3 or Zn&#8208;AcOH. The ring transformation proceeded readily under the conditions of this reduction which is an unprecedented process. Primary amines formed by catalytic hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;azido&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoesters with larger ring sizes or with benzannulation do not show this rearrangement under the conditions of the azide reduction. In these cases, the ring transformation to respective lactams was achieved by treatment of the &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoesters with a stoichiometric amount of lithium diisopropylamide.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent Directed Diastereodivergent Synthesis of Spiro&#8208;Oxindoles with Quaternary Carbon Center Forming</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient method has been developed to achieve for solvent&#8208;directed diastereodivergent cyclization reactions with quaternary center formation. Various spiro&#8208;oxindole diastereoisomers were synthesized with good yields (up to &gt;99%) and moderate to high diastereoselectivities (up to &gt;20:1). Further study on NMR studies indicates that the key to this approach lies in different interactions between the substrate and organocatalyst across diverse solvents. This methodology may have significant implications for switchable, solvent&#8208;directed diastereodivergent synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Use of Formic Acid as a CO Surrogate for the Reduction of Nitroarenes in the Presence of Dienes: A Two&#8208;Step Synthesis of N&#8208;Arylpyrroles via 1,2&#8208;Oxazines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formic acid, activated by acetic anhydride and a base, was employed as a CO surrogate to deoxygenate nitroarenes to nitrosoarenes, a reaction catalyzed by a palladium/phenanthroline complex in the homogeneous phase. Nitrosoarenes were trapped by conjugated dienes to give 3,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;[1,2]&#8208;oxazines. The latter were then transformed into N&#8208;arylpyrroles employing CuCl as the catalyst. The reaction was designed to give the best results for pyrroles lacking any substituent in the 2 and 5 positions, which are difficult to produce employing most pyrrole syntheses.</dc:description>

         <title>Tumor Carbohydrate Associated Antigen Analogs as Potential Binders for Siglec&#8208;7</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigated two recently synthesized and characterized sialyl derivatives, bearing the Neu5Ac&#8208;&#945;&#8208;(2&#8208;6)&#8208;Gal epitope, as promising binders for Siglec&#8208;7, an inhibitory Siglec mainly found on natural killer cells. A variety of sialoglycan structures can be recognized by Siglec&#8208;7 with implications in the modulation of immune responses. Notably, overexpression of sialylated glycans recognized by Siglec&#8208;7 can be associated with the progression of several tumors, including melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. NOE&#8208;based NMR techniques, including Saturation Transfer Difference and transferred&#8208;NOESY NMR, together with molecular docking and dynamic simulations were combined to shed light on the molecular basis of Siglec&#8208;7 recognition of two conformationally constrained Sialyl&#8208;Tn antigen analogs. We, therefore, identify the ligands epitope mapping and their conformational features and propose 3D models accurately describing the protein&#8208;ligand complexes. We found that the binding site of Siglec&#8208;7 can accommodate both synthetic analogs, with the sialic acid mainly involved in the interaction. Moreover, the flexibility of Siglec&#8208;7 loops allows a preferred accommodation of the more rigid compound bearing a biphenyl moiety at position 9 of the sialic acid that contributed to the interaction to a large extent. Our findings provided insights for developing potential novel high affinity ligands for Siglec&#8208;7 to hinder tumor evasion.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Hydrosilylation of Imines by Aluminum Hydride Cations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide range of imines were hydrosilylated with a variety of silanes under the catalytic potential of electronically unsaturated cationic aluminum hydrides. Imines were activated by the cationic Al hydrides via the Lewis adduct formation and subsequently reduced by the silanes.







Abstract
In this work, the catalytic activity of electronically unsaturated three coordinated aluminum hydride cations [LAlH]+[HB(C6F5)3]&#8722; (1) and [LAlH]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; (2) in hydrosilylation of imines has been disclosed (L={(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3N)P(Ph2)}2N). A variety of organo&#8208;silanes such as Et3SiH, MePhSiH2, PhSiH3, TMDSO, and PHMS are screened in this endeavour. The amines as products of catalysis were obtained in good to excellent yields after the hydrolysis of silylamine intermediates. Further, a series of controlled experiments systematically designed to investigate the underlying mechanistic pathway through multinuclear NMR analysis showed Lewis adduct formation between cationic aluminum centre and the imine nitrogen, which subsequently undergoes reaction with silane to afford the product. The hydrosilylation of imine performed with Et3SiH using catalyst 1 with a loading of 2&#8197;mol&#8201;% at 60&#8201;&#176;C occurs smoothly. Whereas 2 led to the product formation with Et3SiH only when used in stoichiometric quantity. Further, to investigate this unique behaviour of 1 NMR investigations were performed and revealed that the anion in 1 competes for hydride delivery and in&#8208;situ generates B(C6F5)3 that cooperatively reinforces the catalytic activity of 1.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid phase oligonucleotide synthesis calls for improved methodologies. We have tested an acetal modification for protection of the 5&#8217;&#8208;O site of nucleotide building blocks. Good yields were obtained in synthesis of short 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyoligonucleotides by phosphoramidite chemistry on a soluble support.

5'&#8208;O&#8208;(2&#8208;isopropoxyprop&#8208;2&#8208;yl) (IIP)&#8208;protection was introduced to 5&#8217;&#8208;OH function of nucleosides in high yields by an acid&#8208;catalysed transacetalization with 2,2&#8208;diisopropoxypropane. The applicability of this temporal 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;protecting group was demonstrated in the liquid phase oligonucleotide synthesis (LPOS) using the corresponding phosphoramidite building blocks (dA, dG, dC and dT) and a tetrapodal precipitative soluble support. Standard protecting groups were used on nucleobases. Tetrazole as an activator, followed by oxidation using m&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid, was used for the coupling. The IIP was shown to be a capable choice to the 5&#8217;&#8208;O protection in solution phase synthesis. It could be readily removed with formic acid (t1/2&lt;10&#8197;s in 6&#8201;% HCOOH in dichloromethane/methanol (2/1) at RT), resulting in volatile byproducts (acetone and isopropanol).

     alt="5'-O-(2-Isopropoxyprop-2-yl)-protected Phosphoramidite Building Blocks in the Liquid Phase Oligonucleotide Synthesis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquid phase oligonucleotide synthesis calls for improved methodologies. We have tested an acetal modification for protection of the 5&#8217;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt; site of nucleotide building blocks. Good yields were obtained in synthesis of short 2&#8217;-deoxyoligonucleotides by phosphoramidite chemistry on a soluble support. The advantages of the title group include fast cleavage, easily removable volatile residues, and small size improving the atom economy.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches to &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, and &#948;&#8208;Lycoranes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review compiles the current synthetic approaches toward lycoranes. Particularly, all those synthetic approaches gave access to &#945;&#8208;lycorane (19&#8197;routes), &#946;&#8208;lycorane (10&#8197;routes), &#947;&#8208;lycorane (38&#8197;routes), and &#948;&#8208;lycorane (6&#8197;routes), with 15&#8197;different routes reporting asymmetric total synthesis, mainly taking advantage of organocatalysts and transition metals.







Abstract
Lycorane is a pentacyclic core presented in alkaloids isolated from the Amaryllidaceae family of herbaceous flowering plants. Members of this class of natural products have shown to display important biological properties including analgesic, antiviral, and antiproliferative activities. This review presents the known synthetic routes toward &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, and &#948;&#8208;lycoranes. &#945;&#8208;(19&#8197;routes), &#946;&#8208;(10&#8197;routes), &#947;&#8208;(38&#8197;routes), and &#948;&#8208;(6&#8197;routes).

         <title>Insights into the Self&#8208;Filling Effects of Branched Isopropyl Groups on the Conformational and Supramolecular Properties of Isopropoxyprism[6]arene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The closed state cuboid D2&#8208;conformation of the isopropoxy&#8208;prism[6]arene shows four isopropyl groups folded inside the cavity, to give C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions and filling the internal void. The cuboid D2&#8208;conformation of PrS[6]iPr is stabilized to a greater extent than ethyl or propyl groups in PrS[6]Et and PrS[6]nPr. The higher resistance of PrS[6]iPr to open its cuboid D2 conformation, with respect to PrS[6]Et and PrS[6]nPr, also affected its supramolecular and conformational features.







Abstract
In this work, the direct macrocyclization of a prism[6]arene macrocycle bearing branched alkyl chains on the rims is reported. Isopropoxyprism[6]arene adopts in solution and in the solid state a cuboid D2&#8208;conformation in which four isopropyl groups are folded inside the cavity, to give C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions and filling the internal void. The conformational features of isopropoxyprism[6]arene have been studied by dynamic 1H NMR experiments. The presence of branched isopropyl chains on the prism[6]arene rims, stabilizes the cuboid D2&#8208;conformation to a greater extent than ethyl or propyl groups in PrS[6]Et and PrS[6]nPr. The higher resistance of PrS[6]iPr to open its cuboid D2 conformation, with respect to PrS[6]Et and PrS[6]nPr, also affected its binding abilities. In fact, alkylammonium&#8208;based endo&#8208;cavity complexes of PrS[6]iPr show lower binding constant values than the analogous propoxy/ethoxy&#8208;prism[6]arene complexes.

         <title>DBS&#8208;Based Eutectogels: Organized Vessels to Perform the Michael Addition Reaction
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramaolecular eutectogels were used as reaction &#8220;vessel&#8221; to perform the Michael addition reaction. Data collected allowed to identify the relationship between structural features of soft materials and catalytic activity.







Abstract
Supramolecular eutectogels were obtained from the gelation of 1,3&#8201;:&#8201;2,4&#8208;dibenzylidene&#8208;D&#8208;sorbitol (DBS) in cholinium chloride&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents (DES), differing for the nature of the hydrogen bond donor. Ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, glycerol and urea were tested. Soft materials were fully characterized, determining critical gelation concentration, gel&#8208;sol transition temperatures and mechanical properties. Furthermore, to have information about the organization of the gelator in the tridimensional network, resonance light scattering, circular dichroism and microscopy investigations were performed. Eutectogels were used as organized &#8220;vessels&#8221; to perform the L&#8208;proline catalyzed Michael addition reaction. The probe reaction was carried out in gel phase and in DES solution. Data collected shed light on the effect that gel microenvironment exerts on the outcome of the reaction. In general, gel phases allowed having comparable or even better results than the ones collected in DES solution, with better results obtained in soft materials with the highest organization, as accounted for by the presence of larger aggregates and the occurrence of stronger intermolecular interactions.

     alt="DBS-Based Eutectogels: Organized Vessels to Perform the Michael Addition Reaction**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supramaolecular eutectogels were used as reaction &#8220;vessel&#8221; to perform the Michael addition reaction. Data collected allowed to identify the relationship between structural features of soft materials and catalytic activity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular eutectogels were obtained from the gelation of 1,3&#8201;:&#8201;2,4-dibenzylidene-D-sorbitol (DBS) in cholinium chloride-based deep eutectic solvents (DES), differing for the nature of the hydrogen bond donor. Ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, glycerol and urea were tested. Soft materials were fully characterized, determining critical gelation concentration, gel-sol transition temperatures and mechanical properties. Furthermore, to have information about the organization of the gelator in the tridimensional network, resonance light scattering, circular dichroism and microscopy investigations were performed. Eutectogels were used as organized &#8220;vessels&#8221; to perform the L-proline catalyzed Michael addition reaction. The probe reaction was carried out in gel phase and in DES solution. Data collected shed light on the effect that gel microenvironment exerts on the outcome of the reaction. In general, gel phases allowed having comparable or even better results than the ones collected in DES solution, with better results obtained in soft materials with the highest organization, as accounted for by the presence of larger aggregates and the occurrence of stronger intermolecular interactions. In turn, this accounts also for the effect of substrates structure that indicates that better yields could be obtained in the presence of more flexible nucleophile and dienones, having more extended &#960;-surface.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Alkynyl Thioamides: An Efficient Thioacylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient protocol was developed for the preparation of a variety of alkynyl thioamides starting from tetraalkyl thiuram compounds (TMTM, TIBTM) and alkynes in CuI/Cs2CO3 system. This method features inexpensive starting materials, good to excellent yields and easy operation, illustrating its potential synthetic value for the synthesis of thioamides and their derivatives.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed efficient synthesis of alkynyl thioamides starting from tetraalkyl thiuram compounds (TMTM: tetramethyl thiuram monosulfide, TIBTM: tetraisobutyl thiuram monosulfide) and alkynes was reported. Thus, tetraalkyl thiurams reacted with alkynes smoothly, giving a variety of alkynyl thioamides promoted by CuI/Cs2CO3 system. This protocol features easy operation, inexpensive starting materials and good yields, illustrating its potential synthetic value for the synthesis of thioamides and their derivatives.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achiral purely organic molecules can show selectivity towards circularly polarized light in emission in the presence of a magnetic field. This phenomenon is called magnetic circularly polarized luminescence (MCPL). Recently a few examples of MCPL from organic molecules have appeared in the literature. Through this technique, interesting photophysical information can be inferred and, moreover, a few technological applications can be devised based on this principle. This short review has the purpose to give a general introduction to this recent field of research and some critical insights on the reported examples.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Upcycling of Polyolefins through C&#8211;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyolefins consist of abundant hydrophobic C&#8722;C and C&#8722;H bonds, and are considered as immensely potential untapped resources. Chemical upcycling offers a convenient and promising recycling strategy of polyolefins to produce newly&#8208;functionalized polymeric materials, and high&#8208;value added chemicals. The significant progress made in C&#8211;H functionalization reactions of alkane molecules provides new opportunities for improving polyolefin treatments. This review focuses on recent advancements in post&#8208;modification routes, specifically the introduction of C&#8211;C and C&#8211;X (X = O, N, S, halogens and etc.) bonds onto polyolefin chain backbones, as well as degradation models involving homogeneous C&#8211;H functionalization. By emphasizing these developments, we aim to highlight the potential of chemical upcycling for enhancing the treatment of polyolefins.</dc:description>

         <title>DFT Calculations and Synthesis Reveal: Key Intermediates, Omitted Mechanisms, and Unsymmetrical Bimane Products</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Theoretical and experimental mixed approaches are complementary and valuable. Our DFT calculations support the mechanism suggested by Kosower, adding to it a key diaziridine intermediate that determines the relative product distribution of this reaction. Our results are consistent with the formation of the diazoketene intermediate as the rate&#8208;limiting step. Based on curve fittings, first or second&#8208;order kinetics cannot be ruled out. This may indicate that more than one mechanism is simultaneously at play in this transformation. This unexpected outcome led us to study an alternative cyclopropenone intermediate. Although cyclopropenone is not likely to be formed under thermal conditions, adding it to the reaction mixture results in bimane structures. The most staggering finding from this investigation was the unanticipated generation of the unsymmetrical anti&#8208;(Me,Me)(Ph,Ph)bimane. The optimization of this route towards unsymmetrical bimanes will require additional investigation.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling with Natural Deep Eutectic Solvent as Liquid&#8208;Assisted Grinding Additive: Merging Two Fields for a Greener Strategy</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of volatile solvents for organic synthesis is nowadays questioned due to their negative impact on the environnement. In order to develop sustainable and environmentally friendly methodologies, we propose to combine two green chemistry concepts: the use of bioinspired solvents: natural deep eutectic solvents (NaDES), and mechanochemistry. Using the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling as a model reaction, we described an efficient mechanochemical method with NaDES as a LAG (liquid&#8208;assisted grinding) additive with short reaction times and without any ligand or additional heating. A mechanochemical extraction was also used to reduce the amounts of extraction solvents and the total time of the synthesis process.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fluorescent Probe for Al3+ Based on Calix[4]arene Containing Salicylaldehyde&#8208;Derived Schiff Base</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two novel fluorescent probes L1 and L2 for recognizing Al3+ have been prepared by cooperating salicylaldehyde&#8208;derived Schiff base groups onto the upper rim of the calix[4]arene. Of these probes, L2 is the most effective at recognizing Al3+, displaying a highly selective fluorescence "on" response with an emission wavelength at 478 nm and a Stokes shift of 88 nm. Additionally, probe L2 can form a 1:1 coordination complex with Al3+ with a binding constant of 2.6&#215;1010 M&#8208;1. Furthermore, its fluorescence intensity exhibits a good linear relationship with Al3+ concentration within the range of 2.0&#215;10&#8208;5 M to 1.4&#215;10&#8208;4 M, and the probe has a low detection limit of 4.36&#215;10&#8208;7 M.</dc:description>

         <title>HBTU Mediated Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated &#947;&#8208;Lactams from E&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated &#947;&#8208;Amino Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Z&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams have been found in many biologically active peptide natural products. Due to their biological activities, extensive efforts have been made in the literature to synthesize the Z&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams. Here, we are reporting the spontaneous transformation of E&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids into Z&#8208;&#945;,&#946;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactam through in&#8208;situ activation of free carboxylic acid using peptide coupling reagent HBTU and base DIPEA at room temperature. The transformation also involves the E&#8594;Z isomerization of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids. The reaction is also compatible with the peptides consisting of E&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amino acids at the Cterminus. The Z&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams were isolated in very good yields. Even though the reaction required very mild conditions, the products were isolated in the form of a racemic mixture. However, the products can be separated under a chiral environment. No Z&#8208;lactams were observed if the reaction was performed in the presence of free amines. In addition, no racemization was observed during the peptide synthesis. The analysis of the reactions of various substrates revealed that amide NH and &#947;&#8208;CH are important for lactamization. No &#947;&#8208;lactams or E&#8594;Z isomerization products were observed in the case of N&#8208;Me(E)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids, whereas in the case of E&#8208;&#945;,&#946;unsaturated &#947;,&#947;&#8208;dimethyl amino acid Z&#8208;lactam was isolated, however, with low yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Switchable Synthesis of 7&#8208; and 14&#8208;Membered Cyclic Peptides Containing N&#8208;Methyl&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Amino Acids Utilizing Microflow Technology</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switchable synthesis of 7&#8208; and 14&#8208;membered cyclic peptides containing non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids was achieved. This is the first report that describes the synthesis of smaller cyclic N&#8208;methylated peptides via dimerization&#8208;cyclization strategy.







Abstract
Smaller cyclic peptides containing non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids have garnered much attention for use as drugs, but their chemical synthesis is extremely challenging. In this study, a rapid (60.5&#8197;min) synthesis of 7&#8208; and 14&#8208;membered cyclic peptides containing N&#8208;methyl&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;amino acids was achieved by only switching the concentrations (0.20&#8197;M or 0.01&#8197;M) of the substrates. The developed approach required neither expensive transition&#8208;metals nor expensive coupling agents. As far as we could ascertain, this is the first report of the synthesis of smaller (&#8804;16&#8208;membered) cyclic N&#8208;methylated peptides via dimerization&#8208;cyclization strategy.

         <title>A Dual Photoredox and Cp2TiCl2 Catalyzed Approach for the Direct Access to &#945;&#8208;Vinyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the first time, a dual photoredox and titanocene catalyzed methodology for the regioselective access to &#945;&#8208;vinyl&#8208;&#223;&#8208;hydroxy esters towards aldehyde allylation with 4&#8208;bromobut&#8208;2&#8208;enoate is reported. The protocol is based on the Barbier&#8208;type properties of the inexpensive and available Cp2TiCl2 in catalytic amount (5 mol%). The developed mild reaction conditions gave access to a library of differently functionalized &#945;&#8208;vinyl&#8208;&#223;&#8208;hydroxy&#160;esters in moderate diastereoselectivity, employing the commercially available ethyl 4&#8208;bromobut&#8208;2&#8208;enoate and both aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes. The reaction was realized under visible light irradiation, in the presence of an organophotocatalyst (3DPAFIPN, 2 mol%) combined with Hantzsch&#8217;s ester as the sacrificial reductant. In contrast to other Barbier type reactions employing ethyl 4&#8208;bromobut&#8208;2&#8208;enoate, the photoredox system ensures a better regioselectivity. Moreover, the use of preformed organometallic nucleophilic species (e.g., dienolborinates), and the need of metal reductants or stoichiometric amount of transition metals in low oxidation state for Barbier&#8208;type reactions, is avoided. To support the experimental evidence, a detailed photophysical study shed light on the mechanism of the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Amination of Isonitriles in Water: Urea Synthesis under Biocompatible Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal reactions have been widely used to track biomolecules in living systems. Due to stringent requirements of physiological conditions, enriching the toolkit of bioorthogonal reactions remains the most important and challenging issue. Herein, the biocompatible ligation of isonitriles and amines to ureas in neutral aqueous medium was developed for the first time. The ligation showed benign nature of biocompatibility, broad substrate scope, and specific chemoselectivity. Meanwhile, urea as a natural linkage, its derivatives played an important role in medicinal chemistry. The second&#8208;order reaction rate constant (k2) was determined, which was higher or comparable to that of Staudinger ligation and strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC). Direct labeling of Ac4GlcN has been achieved in Hep G2 cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd(II)/Lewis Acid Catalyzed Intramolecular Oxidative C&#8722;H Amination to Construct Carbazoles with Dioxygen</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd(II)/LA catalyst was explored for intramolecular oxidative C&#8722;H amination reaction of 2&#8208;acetaminobiphenyls to construct carbazoles with O2 as the sole oxidant. The mechanistic studies supported that the C&#8722;H activation by Pd(II) was a reversible step and the palladacycle intermediate was identified through 1H&#8197;NMR characterizations.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed oxidative C&#8722;H amination reactions are among the most attractive topics in organic synthesis to construct nitrogen&#8208;containing motifs. The challenge is that most of these reactions employed stoichiometric oxidants to achieve satisfied catalytic efficiencies. Herein, we report a Pd(II)/LA&#8208;catalyzed (LA: Lewis acid) oxidative C&#8722;H amination reaction of 2&#8208;acetaminobiphenyls to construct carbazoles by using dioxygen balloon as the sole oxidant source, and the presence of LA sharply improved the catalytic efficiency of Pd(OAc)2. Remarkably, in certain cases, the deacetylation of the annulation product happened under standard conditions to afford free carbazoles as the final product. The H/D exchange studies confirmed the reversibility of C&#8722;H activation and also disclosed multiple C&#8722;H activation sites by using &#8722;NAc and &#8722;NTs as the directing groups. In addition, the palladacycle compound was identified through 1H&#8197;NMR characterizations and proved to be the intermediate prior to the carbazole formation.

         <title>Lateral Deprotometallation&#8208;Trapping Reactions on Methylated Pyridines, Quinolines and Quinoxalines Using Lithium Diethylamide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The behavior of methylated heterocycles (picolines, 2,4&#8208;lutidine, methylquinolines and 2&#8208;methylquinoxaline) in deprotometallation&#8208;trapping sequences using lithium diethylamide was studied.







Abstract
The functionalization of methylated azines and diazines has aroused the interest of chemists given the structural diversity that it affords. Hindered lithium dialkylamides have been used to deprotometallate these substrates chemoselectively. In contrast, it can be observed that, despite some promising work, lithium diethylamide has been used very little for this purpose. Our objective here is on the one hand to make an inventory of what reagents have been used to deprotometallate methylpyridines, &#8208;quinolines and &#8208;quinoxalines, and on the other hand to describe the results obtained by seeking to functionalize a series of substrates with lithium diethylamide (picolines, 2,4&#8208;lutidine, methylquinolines and 2&#8208;methylquinoxaline). Our efforts to take advantage of the use of an in&#8208;situ trap (a zinc chloride chelate) in these reactions are also described.

         <title>Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH)&#8208;Mediated Oxidative Hydroxylation of Arylboronic Acids and Its Applications in C&#8208;O Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a facile methodology for the transformation of arylboronic acids into phenols through NaOH&#8208;mediated air oxidation. The reaction involves the transmetalation of the resulting borate ester with NaOH, facilitating the direct derivatization of the resulting ArONa into aryl ethers and esters using alkyl and acyl halides. This approach offers a straightforward and efficient route to diversify the synthesized compounds.







Abstract
We have developed a straightforward methodology for converting arylboronic acids into phenols using NaOH&#8208;mediated air oxidation. This reaction offers several advantages, including simple operation, excellent tolerance towards various functional groups, and scalability. The transmetalation of the resulting borate ester with NaOH occurs readily, enabling convenient derivatization of the borate ester into aryl ethers and esters using alkyl and acyl halides.

         <title>Direct Electrochemical Ritter&#8208;Type Amination of Electron&#8208;Deficient Arenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical protocol for a practical and direct method for the electron&#8208;deficient C(sp2)&#8722;H Ritter&#8208;type amination under mild conditions was developed. This method is characterized by inexpensive and easily accessible regents, atom and step economy. With moderate to good yields, this useful and simple process produces a number of acetanilides from simple electron&#8208;deficient arenes, including mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;substituted arenes.







Abstract
Due to the high oxidation potentials of electron&#8208;deficient aromatic hydrocarbons, it is difficult to achieve the direct oxidative C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds functionalizations of such substrates. Herein, we develop a Ritter&#8208;type amination of electron&#8208;deficient aromatics by merging electricity and sulfate. This practical and straightforward method provides a series of acetanilides from simple electron&#8208;deficient arenes, including mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted arenes (22&#8197;examples, up to 75&#8201;%) with moderate to good yields under mild conditions. This method is characterized by cheap and readily available regents, atom and step economy.

         <title>Quantifying the Electronic Effect of C4 and C4&#8242; Positions of Bipyridine Ligand on Pd(II)/Rh(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Conjugate Addition Reaction: A DFT Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study screens a parameter Mayer bond order which can quantitatively describe the electronic effects of 4 and 4&#8242; positions on each side of the bipyridine ligands for activation energy barrier of insertion step in Pd(II)/Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed conjugate addition reactions. The dominant &#963;&#8208;donation of ligand to Pd(II) and the dominant &#8220;&#960;&#8208;back donation&#8221; of Rh(I) to ligand are the main reason for the opposite trends of correlation between the activation energy barrier with Mayer bond order on the ligand&#8208;Pd(II)/Rh(I).







Abstract
The electronic effects of the bidentate ligands play a vital role in the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed conjugate addition reactions. Here, the insertion step (rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) of the conjugate addition) catalyzed by Pd(II)/Rh(I)&#8208;complexes with 26&#8197;bipyridine&#8208;type (bpy) ligands linking different substituent groups in the opposite sides (C4, C4&#8242; position) are systematically studied by density functional theory (DFT). It is found that for both Pd(II)&#8208; and Rh(I)&#8208;catalysis, the stronger the electron&#8208;withdrawing group connecting to both C4 and C4&#8242; positions of bpy ligands can promote the insertion step. The predominance of &#960;&#8208;back donation in Rh(I) and &#963;&#8208;donation in Pd(II) is the main reason for above different electronic properties of Pd(II) and Rh(I)&#8208;catalysis. This work gives enough theoretical guide to the rational design of the efficient transition metal&#8208;based catalyst for conjugate addition.

This work gives enough theoretical guide to the rational design of the efficient transition metal-based catalyst for conjugate addition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multienzymatic Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Lactam Building Blocks from Unsaturated Esters and Hydroxylamine</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The assembly of enzymatic cascades and multi&#8208;step reaction sequences represents an attractive alternative to traditional synthetic&#8208;organic approaches. The biocatalytic reaction mediators offer not only mild conditions and permit the use of environmentally benign reagents, but the high compatibility of different enzymes promises more streamlined reaction setups. In this study, a triple&#8208;enzymatic strategy was developed that enables the direct conversion of &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated esters to N&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactame building blocks. Hereby, a lipase&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylaminolysis generates hydroxamic acid intermediates that are subsequently aerobically activated by horseradish peroxidase and glucose oxidase to cyclize in an intramolecular nitroso ene reaction. Utilizing the hydroxyl&#173;aminolysis/ene&#8208;cyclization sequence for the preparation of an aza&#8208;spirocyclic lactam, the multi&#8208;enzymatic methodology was successfully employed in the synthesis of key intermediates en route to alkaloids of the Cephalotaxus family.</dc:description>

         <title>Diols Speed Up Guanidine Base Catalyzed Claisen&#8208;Schmidt Condensation to Produce New 15&#8208;Arylidene Steroids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diols are efficient co&#8208;catalysts in guanidine catalysed condensation of ketones and aldehydes. According to quantum chemical calculations the acceleration effect can be explained by the formation of complexes of carbonyl compounds and diols held together by double H&#8208;bonding. The base/diol mixture can be separated from the product and recycled by reversible CO2 capture and release.







Abstract
Considerable acceleration was observed in the guanidine&#8208;base catalysed Claisen&#8208;Schmidt condensation of benzaldehyde and a 17&#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;18&#8208;nor&#8208;5&#945;,13&#945;&#8208;androstan&#8208;16&#8208;one (1) in the presence of ethylene glycol. Rate&#8208;enhancement effects of various alcohols and diols were compared. In quantum chemical calculations, coordination of the carbonyl group of the substrate was found to reduce the potential barrier to the proton transfer from the &#945; carbon and thus facilitate the formation of the anion that attacks the aldehyde. Both the experiments and the calculations showed that diols enhance the reactivity more efficiently than alcohols. Ethylene glycol/guanidine&#8208;base mixtures were found to be efficient catalysts and solvents in the synthesis of a range of new 17&#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;18&#8208;nor&#8208;13&#945;&#8208;15&#8208;arylidene steroids. This solvent mixture has a further advantage: the crude products can be isolated by simple extraction after introduction of CO2. It is also shown that by the proper choice of the base, the base/diol mixture can be recycled.

         <title>Investigations into the Aqueous Synthesis of Selenoglycoconjugates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the direct conjugation of unprotected glycosyl diselenides with various biomolecules, including resorcinol, resveratrol, as well as the antitumor agent gimeracil, is reported. The Se&#8208;aglycon could be oxidatively cleaved from the sugar, priming these molecules for targeted cancer therapy. The generality and broad substrate scope of this novel procedure will also allow access to various selenium&#8208;containing glycomimetics and glycoconjugates.







Abstract
Glycosylation of bioactive molecules has been found to improve the pharmacokinetic properties of the parent molecule. However, their syntheses often require tedious protecting group manipulations. The development of methodologies which allow direct aqueous conversion of unprotected sugars into glycosides is therefore an ambitious goal. Herein, we present a broadly applicable method for the synthesis of selenoglycosides in water. We show the ease of direct conjugation of unprotected glycosyl diselenides with various biomolecules, including resorcinol, resveratrol, and the antitumor agent, gimeracil, furnishing the corresponding selenoglycoconjugates in up to 96&#8201;% yield. We also demonstrate the oxidatively&#8208;triggered release of the bioactive drug from the sugar, priming these molecules for medicinal applications. The generality and broad substrate scope of this novel transformation will provide access to various selenium&#8208;containing glycomimetics and glycoconjugates.

Abstract
A Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction of indolizines with 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones catalyzed by B(C6F5)3 is described. This protocol gives access to indolizine derivatives that are valuable building blocks in synthetic and pharmaceutical chemistry. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, affording various C2&#8208;quaternary indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones based on indolizine with high yields and regioselectivities. Moreover, the synthetic transformations of the target products were realized by N&#8208;methylation and trifluoromethane sulfonation.

The enantio and diastereoselective synthesis of vinyl cyclopentenols by a Heck reaction was accomplished. It features the use of chiral N,N&#8208;ligands, and a delicate balance of non&#8208;covalent interactions of the cationic palladium complex with the nucleophilic oxygen group of the substrates. VCD played a critical role to establish the relative and the absolute stereochemistry of the Heck products.







Abstract
This work describes an effective method to obtain chiral vinyl cyclopentenols with a high degree of enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity through Heck desymmetrization of cyclopent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethanol using vinyl triflates as coupling agents and chiral N,N ligands. This Heck vinylation protocol allowed the synthesis of several structurally complex cyclopentenols in isolated yields of up to 80&#8201;% in enantiomeric ratios of up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3 and diastereoselectivities higher than 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 in most cases. Experiments using (E) or (Z) vinyl triflates, and desymmetrization of protected olefin 1&#8208;(cyclopent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethoxy)&#8208;4&#8208;nitrobenzene (17) were instrumental in rationalizing the observed diastereoselectivities of Heck products involving the interaction of vinyl triflate carbonyl and the hydroxyl group moiety of the substrate with the cationic Pd(II) complex. The absolute configuration of the vinylated Heck products was determined by Vibrational Circular Dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy.

One central building block: A versatile synthesis of several seven&#8208;membered heterocyclic ring systems is described. Key steps of our approach are the iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidative C&#8722;C homocoupling of diarylamines to 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(arylamino)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biaryls and their subsequent condensation with 1,1&#8208;dielectrophiles to 6,7&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[d,f][1,3]diazepines, 5,7&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[d,f][1,3]diazepinones, and 5,7&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[c,e][1,2,7]thiadiazepine 6&#8208;oxides.







Abstract
The iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidative C&#8722;C homocoupling of diarylamines affords 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(arylamino)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biaryls which represent crucial synthetic building blocks for an access to a range of seven&#8208;membered heterocyclic ring systems. Reaction with paraformaldehyde, diphenyl carbonate, and diphenyl sulfite as efficient 1,1&#8208;dielectrophiles led to dibenzo[d,f][1,3]diazepines, dibenzo[d,f][1,3]diazepinones, and dibenzo[c,e][1,2,7]thiadiazepine 6&#8208;oxides. The synthetic procedures enable short and practical routes to these 1,3&#8208;diazepine derivatives under mild reaction conditions and with a high tolerance of various functional groups.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Enantiopure Amino Alcohols from Simple Methyl Ketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A site&#8208;selective bromination, followed by a hydrolysis and an enantioselective biocatalytic synthesis yields valuable chiral amino alcohols (phenylglycinol derivatives) with excellent enantiomeric excesses. The presence of an extensive keto&#8208;enol&#8208;tautomerism even expands the range of amino alcohol products.







Abstract
This study highlights the straight&#8208;forward synthesis of substituted 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols from simple and readily available aromatic methyl ketones. Starting from acetophenone derivatives, the straight&#8208;forward synthesis strategy involved an initial bromination of the alpha&#8208;positioned methyl group in the first step, followed by a simple hydrolysis to the hydroxyketone (2&#8208;hydroxyacetophenone). The hydroxylated intermediate was subsequently converted from Silicibacter pomeroyi to the final 1,2&#8208;amino alcohol by using the transaminase. The transaminase&#8208;catalyzed reaction proceeded with yields up to 62&#8201;% and always excellent enantiomeric excess of &gt;99&#8201;%. Interestingly, the keto&#8208;enol&#8208;tautomerism of the hydroxyl ketone yields an unexpected amino alcohol isomer.

Abstract
Ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation and tandem cyclization of 2&#8208;arylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines with iodonium ylides proceed efficiently. For the first time, the easily available iodonium ylides and inexpensive ruthenium complex were employed to synthesize pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]benzimidazole derivatives in good yields under simple and easy&#8208;to&#8208;operate conditions. Several primary mechanism investigations and synthetic applications involving gram&#8208;scale preparation, derivatization reactions and the transformation of iodonium ylide generated in&#8197;situ have also been conducted.

         <title>Direct Trifluoromethylselenolation and Fluoroalkylselenolation of C&#8208;H Bonds: Recent Advances in Reagents Development and Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to their high lipophilicity and strong electron&#8208;withdrawing property, more and more attention has been paid to introducing trifluoromethylseleno and fluoroalkylseleno moieties into organic molecules. In this short review, we categorize the synthesis of compounds that combine selenium and fluorinated moieties into two main types: trifluoromethylselenolation (CF3Se) and fluoroalkylselenolation (RfSe except CF3Se). This review aims to provide a summary of the recent advances in direct C&#8208;H trifluoromethylselenolation and fluoroalkylselenolation from the synthesis of trifluoromethylselenolation and fluoroalkylselenolation reagents to their application. Based on the method of how the RfSe group was introduced, the main content is divided into three parts: transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free reactions, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated/catalyzed reactions and photo&#8208;catalyzed reactions. The general substrate scope, mechanism and limitations would also be discussed so that we hope the review will serve as an inspiration for further research in this appealing research field.</dc:description>

         <title>Protocell Communication Through the Eyes of Synthetic Organic Chemists</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bottom&#8208;up fabrication of synthetic cells (protocells) from molecules and materials, is a major challenge of modern chemistry. A significant breakthrough has been the engineering of protocells capable of chemical communication using&#160;bio&#8208;derived&#160;natural&#160;molecules and&#160;ex situ&#160;stabilised cell machineries. These, however, suffer from short shelf&#8208;lives, high costs, and require mild aqueous conditions. In this Concept Article we analyse the chemistry at the heart of protocell communication to highlight new opportunities for synthetic chemists in protocell engineering. Specifically, we (i) categorise the main bio&#8208;derived chemical communication machineries in enzyme cascades, DNA strand displacement, and gene&#8208;mediated communication; (ii) review the chemistries of these signal transduction machineries; and (iii) introduce new types of bio&#8208;inspired, fully synthetic artificial enzymes to replace their natural counterparts. Developing protocells that incorporate synthetic analogues of bio&#8208;derived signal transduction machineries will improve the robustness, stability and versatility of protocells, and broaden their applications to highly strategic fields such as photocatalysis and fine chemicals production.</dc:description>

Here reports an synthetic method to access polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]chromeno[3,4&#8208;c]pyridine, by palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative annulation of 3&#8208;(1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;2H&#8208;chromen&#8208;2&#8208;one with alkenes using benzimidazole as directing group. In addition, their photophysical properties have been well elucidated with improved quantum yields.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] oxidative annulation of coumarin&#8208;benzimidazoles with olefins for the synthesis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have been achieved. This synthetic protocol gives access to a wide range of structurally distinct imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]chromeno[3,4&#8208;c]pyridines in moderate to good yield with wide functional group tolerance. Further, photophysical properties of annulated scaffolds have been examined, which discloses their interesting solvatochromic emission behaviors.

         <dc:description>
A straightforward method for the facile access of isoindolone spirosuccinimides has been developed through N,O&#8208;directing group&#8208;assisted, cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization of benzamides. Co&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation is the rate&#8208;determining step of this reaction.







Abstract
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed, N,O&#8208;bidentate directing group&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H bond functionalization of benzamides with maleimides was developed for the facile access to isoindolone spirosuccinimides in good to excellent yields. This C&#8722;H bond activation and spirocyclization employing pyridine N&#8208;oxide as directing group provided very good substrate scope and tolerated various functional groups. Furthermore, the mechanistic investigation revealed that the C&#8722;H bond activation is the rate&#8208;determining step of this reaction.

This operationally straightforward method furnishes a broad array of C&#8208;3, Ar&#8722;S/Ar&#8722;Se and &#8208;SCN functionalized derivatives in moderate to high yields. This protocol employs visible light as an environmentally friendly energy source, cost effective inorganic persulfate&#8208;based oxidant and easily procurable dichalcogenides for regioselective C&#8722;H chalcogenation of the substrate at room temperature. Further, regioselective thiocyanation of 4H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;a] pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones was also developed. Mechanistic path for these transformations has been proposed based on light on/off and Stern&#8208;Volmer studies as well as quantum yield calculations.

         <title>Accessing Dihydropyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]indol&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Aminocarbonylative Ring Closure</title>

         <dc:description>
The dihydropyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]indol&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;one (DHPI) scaffold is present in a range of biologically active small molecules. Focusing on the development of a transition metal&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular aminocarbonylation of the 1H&#8208;indole core to furnish a C2&#8722;C3&#8208;fused &#947;&#8208;lactam ring system, a Pd&#8208;catalyzed annulation strategy that permits access to 2,4&#8208;disubstituted DHPIs is showcased.







Abstract
Present in a number of small molecule derivatives that display a wide range of biological activities, the dihydropyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]indol&#8208;(2H)&#8208;one (DHPI) core represents an underexplored heterocyclic scaffold. Given the pharmaceutical potential of the DHPI motif, the development of synthetic methodologies that permit their expedient assembly would be highly desirable. Herein, we describe a novel strategy for the construction of the DHPI core from 3&#8208;iodo&#8208;1H&#8208;indolyl substrates, employing an unprecedented Pd&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular aminocarbonylative ring closure. The compatibility of our optimized protocol with various functional groups is highlighted through the synthesis of a range of diversely substituted DHPI derivatives in up to 90&#8201;% isolated yield.

         <title>A Highly Sterically Congested Bis&#8208;Zinc&#8208;Porphyrin Containing a Single Buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyne Linkage: From a Serendipitous Finding to Supramolecular Encapsulation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two zinc&#8208;porphyrin moieties have been covalently attached through a single, rigid buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyne linkage placed at the ortho position of a meso phenyl ring. Despite of freely rotating around the bis&#8208;alkyne axle, such species is adaptable enough to encapsulate a DABCO molecule with a high association constant (K&gt;106&#8197;M&#8722;1) as supported by in&#8208;depth experimental and computational studies.







Abstract
A unique example of a bis&#8208;zinc&#8208;porphyrin chemical system in which both macrocycles are covalently connected with a single, short buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyne linkage placed at the ortho sites of the meso phenyl rings is presented. This dimeric compound resulted from an homo&#8208;coupling side&#8208;reaction taking place during a copper&#8208;catalyzed click reaction between an alkyne porphyrin and 2&#8208;azidopyridine derivatives. Its unexpected formation was rationalized by control experiments and an improved synthesis was achieved under copper&#8208;catalyzed Glaser&#8208;Hay coupling reaction conditions. This highly sterically congested bis&#8208;zinc&#8208;porphyrin derivative behaved as a supramolecular host for encapsulating ditopic molecular guests such as 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) with association constant K1.1 in the order of 106&#8197;M&#8722;1. This value is comparable to current systems that typically feature several connecting linkages between the two zinc&#8208;porphyrin sites resulting in (supra)molecular cages ensuring a high pre&#8208;organization. As such, the requirements to take benefit from supramolecular encapsulation can be reduced to a highly rigid, minimal covalent linkage of four atoms between zinc&#8208;porphyrins as herein described.

         <title>Alternative Functionalization of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Diketopyrrolopyrrole Derivatives
</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) derivatives with thiophene capping rings are widely used as semiconductors in organic electronics. Their optoelectronic properties can be adjusted by adding different electroactive groups or by extending the conjugation of the central core, as well as by regulating their self&#8208;assembly through noncovalent interactions. This work describes an efficient method for synthesizing such derivatives.







Abstract
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) derivatives with thiophene capping rings are widely used as semiconductors in organic electronics. Their optoelectronic properties can be adjusted by adding different electroactive groups or by extending the conjugation of the central core, as well as by regulating their self&#8208;assembly through noncovalent interactions. One effective strategy demonstrated to improve the performance and morphology of organic solar cells is incorporating hydrogen&#8208;bonding units into DPPs. While the functionalization of the DPP lactams and the coupling of aromatic units to the thiophene rings are the most common procedures to tune the properties of such derivatives, modifying the thiophene capping units with hydrogen&#8208;bonding groups is a challenging synthetic task. Despite this difficulty, incorporating amide&#8208;containing substituents into the thiophene rings of single core thiophene&#8208;capped DPP derivatives could yield exciting results, as the advantages of having hydrogen&#8208;bonded &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems based on these modified DPPs have not been explored thoroughly. This work reports on an efficient method for synthesizing such derivatives.

         <title>Organocatalyzed Double C(sp3)&#8722;H Alkylation of Cyclic N&#8208;Sulfonyl Ketimines with 3&#8208;Chloropropiophenones: Selective Access to 2,3,6&#8208;Trisubstituted Pyridines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient de novo access to 2,3,6&#8208;trisubstituted pyridines was successfully synthesized through a mono&#8208; or dialkylation reaction between 4/3&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines with 3&#8208;chloropropiophenones using DIPEA/NaHCO3 as a cheap cooperative basic system and subsequent aza&#8208;cyclization in the presence of NH4OAc under an air.







Abstract
An efficient sequential one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step pseudo&#8208;four&#8208;component reaction between 3/4&#8208;methyl N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines with 3&#8208;chloropropiophenones triggered by DIPEA/NaHCO3 as a cooperative base and subsequent aza&#8208;cyclization using NH4OAc is reported. This transition&#8208;metal&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free technique concocts new C&#8722;C/C=C/C=N&#8722;C bonds selectively, guaranteeing acceptable yields of 2,3,6&#8208;trisubstituted pyridines possessing ortho&#8208;hydroxyaryl/benzenesulfonamide and propiophenone moieties at C2 and C3 positions, respectively. Interestingly, while replacing methyl&#8208;substituents with straight alkyl chains of N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines, only a monoalkylation reaction happened with in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated vinyl ketones to deliver promising yields of 3&#8208;picoline derivatives. Moreover, the synthetic transmutation of prepared pyridine derivative led to several important classes of pyridocoumarin, 5H&#8208;chromenopyridine, and di(pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl) methane derivatives.

     alt="Organocatalyzed Double C(sp3)&#8722;H Alkylation of Cyclic N-Sulfonyl Ketimines with 3-Chloropropiophenones: Selective Access to 2,3,6-Trisubstituted Pyridines"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient de novo access to 2,3,6-trisubstituted pyridines was successfully synthesized through a mono- or dialkylation reaction between 4/3-alkyl-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-sulfonyl ketimines with 3-chloropropiophenones using DIPEA/NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as a cheap cooperative basic system and subsequent aza-cyclization in the presence of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OAc under an air.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient sequential one-pot, two-step pseudo-four-component reaction between 3/4-methyl &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-sulfonyl ketimines with 3-chloropropiophenones triggered by DIPEA/NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as a cooperative base and subsequent aza-cyclization using NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OAc is reported. This transition-metal-oxidant-free technique concocts new C&#8722;C/C=C/C=N&#8722;C bonds selectively, guaranteeing acceptable yields of 2,3,6-trisubstituted pyridines possessing &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxyaryl/benzenesulfonamide and propiophenone moieties at C2 and C3 positions, respectively. Interestingly, while replacing methyl-substituents with straight alkyl chains of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-sulfonyl ketimines, only a monoalkylation reaction happened with in&#8197;situ-generated vinyl ketones to deliver promising yields of 3-picoline derivatives. Moreover, the synthetic transmutation of prepared pyridine derivative led to several important classes of pyridocoumarin, 5&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-chromenopyridine, and di(pyridin-3-yl) methane derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Electrochemical reduction of 1H&#8208;thioxanthene&#8208;1,4,9&#8208;triones, which are representatives of a new class of thioxanthone&#8208;like heterocycles, is a three&#8208;stage process leading to the formation of the corresponding long&#8208;lived radical anions, unstable dianions, and long&#8208;lived 1&#8208;oxy&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1H&#8208;thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;one radical dianions, followed by the formation of 1,4&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1H&#8208;thioxantene&#8208;9&#8208;ones as the final products.







Abstract
A convenient synthetic route was proposed for the synthesis of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;thioxanthene&#8208;1,4,9&#8208;trione. This compound and its 3&#8208;H congener are representatives of a new class of thioxanthone&#8208;like heterocycles, which can be used as building blocks for materials used in organic electronics. Electrochemical reduction (ECR) of 1H&#8208;thioxanthene&#8208;1,4,9&#8208;trione and its 3&#8208;methyl derivative in DMF and acetonitrile is a three&#8208;stage process leading to the formation of the corresponding long&#8208;lived radical anions and unstable dianions at the first and second stages, respectively. In a protolytic equilibrium, dianions are converted into 1&#8208;oxy&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1H&#8208;thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;one anions. Their one&#8208;electron reversible ECR leads to the corresponding radical dianions, followed by the formation of (3&#8208;methyl/H)&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1H&#8208;thioxantene&#8208;9&#8208;ones as the final products. The latter compounds can be converted into the initial (3&#8208;methyl/H)&#8208;1H&#8208;thioxanthene&#8208;1,4,9&#8208;triones. The main intermediates were characterized using a combination of cyclic voltammetry, EPR spectroscopy, 3D spectroelectrochemistry, and DFT calculations at the (U)B3LYP/6&#8208;31+G*/PCM level of theory. A general ECR scheme was proposed for both types of compounds.

         <title>Synthesis of Thiophene&#8208;fused Helicenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of penta&#8208; and hexahelicenes with terminal thiophene rings is achieved by isomerization of ortho,ortho&#8217;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;substituted teraryls using F&#252;rstner's method. Best results were obtained with JohnPhos&#8208;complexed gold(I) as catalyst.







Abstract
The synthesis of three penta&#8208; and three hexahelicenes containing two terminal thiophene units is described. The syntheses of pentahelicenes consist of 1,4&#8208;bisalkynylation of a benzene precursor and double Suzuki coupling in 2,3&#8208;position to introduce thiophene units. The ortho,ortho&#8217; fusion yielding the final products was achieved with F&#252;rstner's protocol using platinum(II) chloride or JohnPhos&#8208;complexed gold(I) as catalysts. A similar approach to hexahelicenes started with a naphthalene derivative, where 2,7&#8208;bisalkynylation and subsequent double Suzuki coupling with thiophene&#8208;2&#8208;boronic acid at 1,8&#8208;position furnished precursors, in which ortho,ortho&#8217; fusion to the respective hexahelicenes was achieved with platinum(II) chloride or, favourably, with indium(III) chloride. UV/Vis spectra and cyclic voltammograms were recorded for all helicenes and HOMO/LUMO gaps were calculated with DFT methods.

The concise and efficient synthesis of tetrahydroquinoline alkaloids lycibarbarines A&#8722;C has been accomplished in four steps from a common intermediate derived from commercially available 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose and 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline.







Abstract
The concise and efficient synthesis of tetrahydroquinoline alkaloids lycibarbarines A&#8722;C has been accomplished in four steps from a common intermediate derived from commercially available 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose and 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline. For the synthesis of the unique tetracyclic spiro&#8208;heterocycle skeleton we employed a synthetic strategy that features two key transformations: iodomethyllithium&#8208;based homologation of lactone / N&#8208;alkylation to access tetracyclic spiro&#8208;heterocycle skeleton in one step and one&#8208;pot acetonide deprotection, hemiacetal formation, and spirocyclization cascade process.

         <title>Efficiently Aerobic Dehydrogenation of N&#8208;Heterocycles and Hydrocarbons over MnAl Oxides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inexpensive, simple and green catalytic system has been developed for the aerobic dehydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles and hydrocarbons based on MnAl oxides. Good application potential was demonstrated by gram scale synthesis and broad substrate scope. Mechanistic studies indicated that dehydrogenation proceeds mainly via an electron transfer mechanism.







Abstract
Dehydrogenation of saturated N&#8208;heterocycles and hydrocarbons provides an important route to corresponding aromatic compounds. Herein, an efficient and selective MnAlO&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidative dehydrogenation of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles, imines and hydrocarbons is presented. The reaction features excellent yields of the products, mild reaction conditions, readily available and reusable catalyst. Various N&#8208;heterocycles and hydrocarbons can be tolerated by the reaction system and transformed to the corresponding aromatic counterparts. Mechanistic studies revealed that the reaction proceeds mainly through an electron transfer mechanism.

         <title>Evaluation of the Stereochemical Lability of Benzo&#8208;Cycloheptene&#8208;Based Drugs Endowed with Potentially Modulable Planar Chirality</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tendence of some popular chiral drugs (endowed with tricyclic&#8208;structures characterized by stereogenic&#8208;plane) to underwent racemization by flipping of their chiral&#8208;plane has been investigated by resorting to both experimental and theoretical approach. The obtained results suggested which structural modifications can be rationally designed in order to modulate their intrinsic stereolability, so allowing to suitably increase their enantiomerization barrier.







Abstract
An experimental and theoretical study was carried out to analyze the configurational lability possessed by some of the most common drugs endowed with a central non&#8208;planar seven&#8208;membered cycloheptadiene ring, which confers chirality to these compounds. In fact, the absence of planarity allows the existence of two enantiomeric species that can interconvert thanks to a ring overturning mechanism. The energy barrier that opposes the inversion of the chiral tricyclic scaffold characterizing such species, which is strongly dependent on the presence of appropriate substituents on the two external cycles, has been investigated through Dynamic&#8208;HPLC and off&#8208;column racemization techniques, as well as through assessments based on molecular modelling approaches. Interesting indications were obtained by making targeted structural changes to allow accurate control of the stereolability characterizing the tricyclic framework.

         <title>Biotransformations with Imine Reductases: Design of a Practical Process Avoiding an Extractive Work&#8208;Up by Entrapment of Water and Enzymes in an Immobilized Phase</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A process concept for the asymmetric biocatalytic reduction of heterocyclic imines addressing the efficiency of the reaction as well as downstream&#8208;processing steps was studied by utilizing a &#8220;heterogenized aqueous phase&#8221;, which contains the needed enzymes and cofactor within a superabsorber (polyacrylate) network, for the biotransformation. The immobilized biocatalytic system, which comprises an imine reductase IRED, NADPH and an alcohol dehydrogenase for cofactor&#8208;recycling, enables to run the reaction in pure organic medium. Thus, instead of an extractive work&#8208;up as typical solution for biotransformations in aqueous medium, which, however, can be tedious due formation of emulsions, this type of IRED&#8208;catalyzed process leads to a simplified work&#8208;up consisting only of a decantation of the liquid organic reaction medium with the product from the heterogenized aqueous biocatalyst system. Exemplified for the (R)&#8208;enantioselective reduction of 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroisoquinoline by the IRED of Streptomyces viridochromogenes as a model reaction, a process was developed leading to 98% conversion, 88% yield and &gt;99% ee at a substrate concentration of 40 mM.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Reductive Amination in Organocatalysis and Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the recent progress in the area of organocatalytic and biocatalytic asymmetric reductive amination (ARA) has been summarized, a challenging but important topic for drug discovery and the pharmaceutical industry. The current challenges and opportunities in organocatalytic and biocatalytic ARA are also discussed.







Abstract
This review summarizes the recent progress of organocatalytic and biocatalytic asymmetric reductive amination (ARA), a challenging but important topic for drug discovery and the pharmaceutical industry. At present, ARA can be divided into three categories: metal catalysis, organic catalysis, and biocatalysis. In the past decade, transition metal&#8208;catalysed ARA has been well established. Organocatalytic ARA has emerged as a powerful alternative to metal&#8208;catalysed ARA, the hydrogen sources used in organocatalytic ARA are usually Hantzsch esters, benzothiazolines, boranes, and hydrosilanes, which require Lewis base or phosphoric acid catalysts to activate them to give secondary chiral amines. It is worth mentioning that biocatalytic ARA has made remarkable progress in the last decade, amino acid dehydrogenases, amine dehydrogenases, opine dehydrogenases and imine reductases have been successfully used in ARA.

         <title>The Evolution of Phosphite&#8208;Oxazoline Ligands for the Pd&#8208;Allylic Substitution and Their Application in Building Chiral Molecules</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept provides an overview of the evolution in the ligand design of biaryl phosphite&#8208;oxazoline ligand libraries for the asymmetric Pd&#8208;catalyzed allylic substitution. In addition, the effectiveness of this approach in the construction of chiral bi&#8208; and tricyclic complex molecules is also summarized.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution (AAS) is a highly effective method for producing chiral molecules with alkene&#8208;substituted frameworks which can be further derivatized. However, its stereochemical outcome is affected by the steric requirements of the substrate and only a narrow set of nucleophiles yield excellent enantioselectivities. In this regard, phosphite&#8208;oxazolines have emerged as strong candidates to be privileged ligands for this process, providing results that surpass most of the previously published studies. They have provided high enantiocontrol when used in the Pd&#8208;AAS of several hindered and unhindered substrates, using a wide range of C&#8208;, O&#8208;, and N&#8208;nucleophiles. In this concept, we review and discuss the current progress made in the design of tailor&#8208;made phosphite&#8208;oxazoline ligand libraries for the Pd&#8208;AAS of a broad range of substrates and nucleophiles and its application in the construction of chiral complex molecules.

     alt="The Evolution of Phosphite-Oxazoline Ligands for the Pd-Allylic Substitution and Their Application in Building Chiral Molecules"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept provides an overview of the evolution in the ligand design of biaryl phosphite-oxazoline ligand libraries for the asymmetric Pd-catalyzed allylic substitution. In addition, the effectiveness of this approach in the construction of chiral bi- and tricyclic complex molecules is also summarized.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pd-catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution (AAS) is a highly effective method for producing chiral molecules with alkene-substituted frameworks which can be further derivatized. However, its stereochemical outcome is affected by the steric requirements of the substrate and only a narrow set of nucleophiles yield excellent enantioselectivities. In this regard, phosphite-oxazolines have emerged as strong candidates to be privileged ligands for this process, providing results that surpass most of the previously published studies. They have provided high enantiocontrol when used in the Pd-AAS of several hindered and unhindered substrates, using a wide range of C-, O-, and N-nucleophiles. In this concept, we review and discuss the current progress made in the design of tailor-made phosphite-oxazoline ligand libraries for the Pd-AAS of a broad range of substrates and nucleophiles and its application in the construction of chiral complex molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Phosphite and Phosphoramidite Ligands for Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroformylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the applications of phosphite and phosphoramidite ligands synthesized by different modules in rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation. It provides ideas for the design, synthesis, and application of modular ligands synthesis for hydroformylation reactions.







Abstract
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation of olefins is an important method for synthesizing aldehydes, and it is worth noting that regioselectivity and enantioselectivity of the product controlled by ligand are the most commonly used strategies. The modular synthesis of phosphite and phosphoramidite ligands have significant advantages of simple synthesis and high catalytic activity, which was why these ligands have been widely used in hydroformylation reactions. Herein, we focus on the synthesis methods and design ideas of such ligands, as well as their application effects in hydroformylation reactions. This review aims to provide a reference for the design and synthesis of ligands in hydroformylation subsequently.

         <title>Synthesis of Soluble Quinacridone Photocatalysts for the Homogeneous Oxidation of Thioethers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, quinacridone (QA) functionalization with EWG groups and N&#8208;alkylation is described, in order to improve QA solubility and photocatalytic oxidizing activity. The synthesized derivatives acted as efficient photocatalysts in the selective aerobic oxidation of thioethers to sulfoxides. Remarkably, N,N&#8217;&#8208;dibutyl&#8208;quinacridone (DBQA) showed the best performances, leading to quantitative thioanisole conversion to sulfoxide in 20 minutes.







Abstract
Evaluation of quinacridone (QA) derivatives as homogeneous metal&#8208;free photocatalysts is here presented. QA derivatives were synthetized and systematically characterized, measuring their ground state and excited state redox potentials in dichloromethane (DCM) and 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP), in order to understand how structural modifications influenced their photocatalytic properties. In particular, the effect of dicyanomethylene and nitro EWG groups was investigated, in order to develop a photocatalyst capable of promoting oxidative processes in the presence of molecular oxygen. Among the analyzed derivatives, 2,9&#8208;dinitro&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;dibutylquinacridone (DNDBQA) was the one with the highest excited state reduction potential (Ered*=1.60&#8197;V in HFIP vs SCE), while N,N&#8217;&#8208;dibutylquinacridone (DBQA) showed valuable excited state redox potentials (Ered*=1.29&#8197;V; Eox*=&#8722;1.28&#8197;V in HFIP vs SCE), making it suitable for bimodal applications in oxidative and reductive photocatalytic processes. Afterwards, the synthetized QA derivatives were examined as photocatalysts to promote the selective aerobic oxidation of thioether to sulfoxide. Promising results in thioanisole oxidation were achieved with all the QA derivatives tested as photocatalysts, in terms of yield and selectivity. Remarkably, DBQA showed the best performances, catalyzing the reaction in only 20 minutes, using 0.5&#8201;% of the photocatalyst, and showing excellent performances in the oxidation of several thioether derivatives.

         <dc:description>
(Cyclo)alkyl Pyridine: A systematic study on the SNAr arylation of nitrile and ester anions with 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;flurropyridine derivatives is described. In combination with hydrolysis and decarboxylation, the method provides an efficient approach to the multigram synthesis of functionalized pyridines decorated with alkyl, cycloalkyl, and saturated heterocyclic substituents at the &#945; or &#947; positions &#8211; valuable building blocks for medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
A systematic study on the SnAr reaction of halogenated fluoropyridines and (hetero)aliphatic nitrile anions as an approach to the synthesis of functionalized pyridines bearing a (cyclo)alkyl or saturated heterocyclic substituent by is described. The scope of the method was demonstrated on a wide range of (hetero)aliphatic nitriles (including three&#8208; to six&#8208;membered cycloalkane derivatives and N&#8208;, O&#8208;, S&#8208;containing saturated heterocycles) and all isomeric halogenated 2&#8208;and 4&#8208;fluoropyridines. High chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity (i.&#8201;e., exclusive substitution of the fluorine atom), as well as excellent scalability of the proposed reaction sequence were demonstrated (up to 450&#8197;g for the arylation step or up to 77&#8197;g of cycloalkylpyridine over two steps in a single run). The utility of the synthesized products was illustrated in the additional functional group transformations resulting in synthetically valuable pyridine&#8208;containing building blocks.

         <title>Forging C&#8722;S Bonds on the Azetidine Ring by Continuous Flow Photochemical Addition of Thiols and Disulfides to Azetines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward method to forge C&#8722;S bonds on the azetidine ring under continuous flow conditions has been disclosed accessing unexplored chemical space. The strategy relies on the light&#8208;promoted radical addition of thiyl radicals to 2&#8208;azetines. Green metrics were calculated to demonstrate the greenness of the flow process compared to batch.







Abstract
A strategy for anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroalkyl/aryl thiolation and disulfidation of 2&#8208;azetines under continuous flow conditions has been developed. Thiyl radicals are generated from thiols or disulfides and subsequently propagate into the azetine unsaturation to forge the C&#8722;S bond and shape a secondary radical intermediate. This carbon&#8208;centered radical chain transfers to another thiol via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) or another disulfide to regenerate the key thiyl radical intermediates. The use of flow technology ensures efficient irradiation of the reaction mixture leading to extremely fast, robust, and scalable protocols. Furthermore, ethyl acetate was adopted as an environmentally responsible solvent.

         <title>Synthesis of an Octacyclic C60 Fragment</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of an unexplored C60&#8208;fragmentary octacycle (C28H16; 4,11&#8208;dihydrodiindeno[7,1,2&#8208;ghi:7&#8242;,1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;pqr]chrysene), which we named Metelykene (derived from &#8220;metelyk&#8221; that means butterfly in Ukrainian) is described. The key precursor is a solution&#8208;processable hexacycle having fourfold tert&#8208;butyls and twofold bromines. The bromines were substituted with carbonyls, and the following cyclization yielded the C60&#8208;fragment core, unattainable so far.







Abstract
Fragments of buckminsterfullerene (C60) include the monumental three compounds corannulene, sumanene, and truxene. These three have served as leading molecules in ongoing research for curved, fused, and &#960;&#8208;extended polyaromatic materials. Achieving more structural variations that join the ranks of these three archetypes remains challenging. Herein we report synthesis of an octacyclic hydrocarbon that is an unexplored C60&#8208;fragment, namely, a 4,11&#8208;dihydrodiindeno[7,1,2&#8208;ghi:7&#8242;,1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;pqr]chrysene (C28H16, which we named Metelykene). The key to success was solution&#8208;compatible synthesis in which double pentagonal rings flank hexagonal ones. This solution&#8208;phase approach, coupled with the resulting non&#8208;planar &#960;&#8208;conjugation, is so straightforward that it offers an entry to a derivative such as a cardo aromatic monomer.

         <title>Carbofluorination of &#960;&#8208;Bonds and Related Reactions Involving Tandem C&#8722;C/C&#8722;F Bond Formation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review on the carbofluorination of &#960;&#8208;bonds and related transformations involving tandem C&#8722;C/C&#8722;F bond forming reactions is presented. The application of electrophilic fluorine and nucleophilic fluoride reagents in this chemistry is described, as well as recently developed protocols involving the use of fluorinated organic molecules in atom&#8208;economic carbofluorination reactions.







Abstract
Due to the unique properties of C&#8722;F bonds, organofluorine compounds occupy a privileged space in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and polymer industries. Carbofluorination reactions involve the formation of a C&#8722;C and a C&#8722;F bond, typically across a &#960;&#8208;bond or another unsaturated functionality that is revealed upon in situ activation. The design of tailored substrates and new catalyst systems has enabled carbofluorination chemistry to emerge as a promising manifold for the synthesis of unique fluorinated scaffolds. This review covers the application of nucleophilic and electrophilic fluorinating reagents in this chemistry, in addition to recently developed atom&#8208;economical carbofluorination reactions using organofluorine compounds as dual reagents.
