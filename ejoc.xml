         <title>Harnessing a Novel Organophotocatalyst for C&#63743;H Functionalization and E&#8211;Z Isomerization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel pyridazine&#8208;based organophotocatalyst that enables light&#8208;driven C&#63743;H functionalization of &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl naphthols and E&#8211;Z isomerization of 1,4&#8208;enedione derivatives. This sustainable methodology offers efficient transformations under mild conditions, showcasing a green alternative to traditional protocols.

Organic chemistry continues to evolve by discovering and applying novel catalytic systems that enable efficient and selective transformations. Herein, the development and utilization of a newly synthesized organophotocatalyst for C&#63743;H functionalization and isomerization reactions are reported. A pyridazine derivative is successfully used here as a photocatalyst to synthesize 1,3&#8208;oxazines via C&#63743;H functionalizations of Betti bases (&#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl naphthols) and for the E&#8211;Z isomerization of 2&#8208;(alkylthio)&#8208;substituted&#8208;1,4&#8208;enedione derivatives. A tentative mechanism is also proposed for the catalytic behavior of the novel photocatalyst.

         <title>Catalytic Behavior of Cobalt Complexes Bearing Imine&#8211;Pyridine&#8211;Oxazoline Ligands in Isoprene Polymerization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NNN&#8208;pincer cobalt complexes are used to catalyze isoprene polymerization. Upon activation with AlEt2Cl, these cobalt complexes exhibit high catalytic activity and thermal stability in isoprene polymerization and provide cis&#8208;1,4/3,4&#8208;polyisoprene (cis&#8208;1,4/3,4&#8201;&#8776;&#8201;2:1).

A series of cobalt complexes bearing imine&#8211;pyridine&#8211;oxazoline ligands are successfully synthesized and characterized. Upon activation with diethylaluminum chloride (AlEt2Cl), these cobalt complexes exhibit high catalytic activity in isoprene polymerization and provide cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;co&#8208;3,4 polyisoprene (cis&#8208;1,4/3,4&#8201;&#8776;&#8201;2:1). Among them, a complex featuring a diphenylmethyl substituent demonstrates the highest thermal stability, maintaining a catalytic activity of up to 1.06&#8201;&#215;&#8201;105&#8201;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 70&#8201;&#176;C. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis shows that this complex adopts a trigonal bipyramidal configuration via N,N,N&#8208;tridentate coordination to the cobalt center. Both the ligand architecture and the polymerization temperature are found to play critical roles in determining the catalytic performance and the structural properties of the resulting polymers. Furthermore, the influence of various polymerization parameters on catalytic activity and selectivity are systematically investigated.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cryptotrione, a potent anticancer and structurally complex C35 terpene belonging to the cryptoquinonemethide family, has an unprecedented [6&#8208;6&#8208;6&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;3] hexacyclic skeleton with a strained bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane core and [5&#8208;5] spirocyclic moiety.

When the reaction was carried out with phenols as an additional nucleophile and Sc(OTf)3 as an activating reagent, tetrahydrofuro[2,3&#8208;b]benzofurans were obtained. The reaction proceeded via a deaminative nucleophilic substitution of 3&#8208;aminopent&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ols with phenols, followed by a successive intramolecular cyclization of the two hydroxy groups with the activated alkyne. When 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds were used as the nucleophile, the corresponding substituted tetrahydrofuro[2,3&#8208;b] furans were formed. To further understand the nature of this reaction, the intramolecular nucleophilic addition of alkynyl diol intermediate with gold complex were investigated as a model substrate using DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Iodine catalysed [3+3] cycloaddition strategy for the&#160;synthesis of carbon substituted 1,4&#8208; piperazines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piperazine moiety is found to be the promising core in several biologically active compounds and some of the marketed blockbuster drugs such as Glivec(imatinib) and Viagra(sildenafil).However, the substitution pattern in the piperazine ring reveals that the synthesis of carbon substituted scaffold remains a challenge without pre&#8208;functionalized piperazine core. Herein, we are disclosing a straightforward, catalytic, one pot, metal&#8208;free synthetic route to synthesize carbon substituted 1,4&#8208;piperazines from easily available starting materials. This synthetic pathway is free from cautious imine synthesis and previously reported well&#8208;articulated starting material which are leading to limited substrate scope. Our approach involves in&#8208;situ generation of 1,3 dipoles and their [3+3] cycloaddition catalyzed by iodine in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Four&#8208;component Strategy to Access Thioether&#8208;Derived Imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines and Imidazo[2,1&#8208;b]thiazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free construction of thioether&#8208;derived imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines and imidazo[2,1&#8208;b]thiazoles holds significant potential in medicinal chemistry. However, the exploration of multicomponent synthesis using simple chemical feedstocks has not been thoroughly investigated. A new four&#8208;component strategy involving base&#8208;mediated annulation and I2&#8208;promoted sulfenylation has been developed, utilizing readily accessible &#945;&#8208;bromoketones, 2&#8208;aminopyridines, and alkyl bromides, with sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3.5H2O) serving as the sulfur source. Consequently, this approach effectively produces a series of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;derived thioethers in moderate to good yields, showcasing a wide substrate scope with good functional group tolerance and compatibility. Furthermore, the multicomponent protocol has been successfully extended to synthesize sulfenyl&#8208;derived imidazo[2,1&#8208;b]thiazoles in acceptable yields using the corresponding 2&#8208;aminothiazole. Importantly, metal&#8208;free multicomponent reactions have been successfully employed on a gram scale in open air, and a plausible mechanism has also been proposed based on existing experimental results.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Preparation of Nickel Porphyrins Bearing Two to Four Nitro Groups at &#946;&#8208;Positions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation and unambiguous identification via NMR spectroscopy of all six &#946;$\beta$,&#946;&#8208;dinitrometalloporphyrin isomers and three out of four&#946;$\beta$,&#946;,&#946;&#8208;trinitrometalloporphyrin isomers are described, along with attempts to prepare &#946;,&#946;,&#946;,&#946;&#8208;tetranitrometalloporphyrins via both direct nitration and condensation of nitropyrroles.

The preparation, isolation, and identification of dinitro, trinitro, and tetranitro metalloporphyrins bearing nitro groups on pyrrole rings&#8212;desirable intermediates that enable fundamental changes in the chemico&#8208;physical properties of the porphyrin core&#8212;are studied. All six possible dinitro&#8208;Ni&#8208;TPP isomers are formed; three are isolated as pure substances using column chromatography, while the remaining three are inseparable. All possible trinitro&#8208;Ni&#8208;TPP isomers are prepared and isolated, except for the 2,7,13 isomer. Attempts to synthesize tetranitro&#8208;Ni&#8208;TPP either through direct nitration of metalloporphyrin or via direct condensation of the nitropyrrole building blocks are unsuccessful. The molecular structures are unambiguously identified using 2D NMR experiments. Some experimental observations, though not all, are consistent with quantum chemical calculations performed on the geometry, energy, Fukui indices, dipole moments of nitroporphyrins, and the energy of nitration intermediates.

         <title>Assembly of 1,2,3&#8208;Triazole&#8208;Fused Polycyclic Compounds by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#63743;H Bond Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,4,5,6&#8208;tetrahydrobenzo[c][1,2,3]triazolo[4,5&#8208;e]azepines and 4,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[5,6]oxepino[3,4&#8208;d][1,2,3]triazoles are synthesized by palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H bond activation. Convenient domino and one&#8208;pot sequential methods are also developed.

A palladium&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;fused heterocycles, such as 1,4,5,6&#8208;tetrahydrobenzo[c][1,2,3]triazolo[4,5&#8208;e]azepines and 4,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[5,6]oxepino[3,4&#8208;d][1,2,3]triazoles, is reported. The method is versatile, high yielding, and even suitable for domino and one&#8208;pot sequential protocols, combining the copper&#8208;catalyzed reaction of alkynes and organic azides (CuAAC) with palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H bond activation. A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed.

&lt;p&gt;A palladium-catalyzed protocol for the synthesis of 1,2,3-triazole-fused heterocycles, such as 1,4,5,6-tetrahydrobenzo[&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;][1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;]azepines and 4,6-dihydro-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-benzo[5,6]oxepino[3,4-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;][1,2,3]triazoles, is reported. The method is versatile, high yielding, and even suitable for domino and one-pot sequential protocols, combining the copper-catalyzed reaction of alkynes and organic azides (CuAAC) with palladium-catalyzed C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H bond activation. A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Towards the Synthesis of 3,3&#8208;Difluoro Deaminated Sialic Acid (C3DFKDN)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;Keto&#8208;3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;glycero&#8208;d&#8208;galacto&#8208;nononic acid (KDN) is a nine&#8208;carbon monosaccharide of the sialic acid family. As a deaminated analogue of N&#8208;acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), KDN features a hydroxyl group at C5 instead of an amine. Although present at low levels in mammalian tissues, KDN is abundant in certain tumor cells and pathogens, making it and its processing enzymes attractive targets for understanding biological functions and developing potential therapeutics. Fluorinated carbohydrate derivatives are widely used to probe and modulate carbohydrate&#8208;active enzymes (CAZymes). Here, we report the first total synthesis of 3,3&#8208;difluoro KDN (C3DFKDN), a novel fluorinated sialic acid derivative and a key intermediate for designing covalent inhibitors and activity&#8208;based probes targeting KDN&#8208;processing enzymes. Introduction of a C3&#8208;difluoro group prevents elimination side reactions common with monofluorinated sialic acid analogues. Two synthetic strategies were explored: (1) coupling a pyranose precursor with a difluorinated alkyne bromide followed by oxidation, and (2) incorporation of a difluoroacetate building block via a Reformatsky&#8208;type reaction. The latter approach proved more effective, affording protected C3DFKDN in an overall yield of 3.7% over 12 steps from methyl &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;mannopyranoside. This work establishes methodology for the synthesis of C3&#8208;difluorinated sialic acids and provides a foundation for developing fluorinated probes and inhibitors of KDN&#8208;related enzymatic pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>A New Homogeneous Catalyst for the Synthesis of 3,3&#8242;&#8208;Bis(indolyl)methanes: Collective Synthesis of Arundine, Turbomycin B, Arsindoline A, and Tris(1H&#8208;Indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methane*</title>

         <dc:description>
3,3'&#8208;Bis(indolyl)methanes (BIMs) are a class of heterocyclic compounds that have demonstrated remarkable biological activities, such as anticancer, antibacterial properties. In this study, an efficient synthetic approach is presented using DABCO(TfOH)2 in conjunction with hexafluoroisopropanol for the preparation of BIMs. This method represents a notable advancement in synthetic chemistry, providing an efficient and flexible approach for the production of bioactive molecules.

An environmentally friendly, cost&#8208;effective, and efficient method for synthesizing 3,3&#8242;&#8208;bis(indolyl)methanes (BIMs) and their derivatives is developed through an electrophilic substitution reaction of indole with various aldehydes. This reaction is catalyzed by DABCO(TfOH)2, a homogeneous catalyst with 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) serving as a solvent. The process, performed exclusively in DABCO(TfOH)2, demonstrates excellent catalytic activity, yielding high product amounts (84%&#8211;98%) and showing broad functional group compatibility, which enables the efficient synthesis of both natural alkaloids and BIM derivatives. Interestingly, natural alkaloids are successfully synthesized to enhance the diversity of the compound library. Mechanistic studies highlight a delicate balance between fluorinated solvent, catalyst, and substrate as essential for achieving nature's approach to selective cyclization in organic synthesis.

         <title>Copper/Bis(imine)&#8208;Catalyzed Fluoroalkylative Thiocyanation of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical addition of a fluorinated fragment and thiocyanate group at the double bond is described. The reaction is performed using copper thiocyanate as a catalyst, which promotes both radical generation and thiocyanation steps.

A method for the radical difunctionalization of nonactivated alkenes using fluorinated halides and thiocyanate anion is described. A combination of cheap copper(I) thiocyanate with a readily accessible bis(imine) ligand promoted the reaction under purple light irradiation without additional photocatalyst. The method is applicable to chloro&#8208; and bromodifluoroacetate, as well as to other fluorinated bromides, and tolerates a wide variety of functional groups.

         <title>The Novel Radical&#8208;Based Strategies for the Construction of &#945;&#8208;Allenols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Allenols play a vital role in organic synthesis as they can undergo a wide range of transformations for the construction of natural products and pharmaceuticals. As compared to the two&#8208;electron transfer ionic pathway, the rapid growth of radical chemistry has provided an alternative strategy to obtain &#945;&#8208;allenols by single&#8208;electron transfer under mild conditions with high efficiency and excellent selectivity.

&#945;&#8208;Allenols have become common advanced synthons for the synthesis of various of structures and are a frequent motif in natural products and pharmaceuticals. The special reactivity can occur due to the synergistic effect of the allene and hydroxy functional groups. Thus, many remarkable and elegant protocols have been explored through ionic pathways for the construction of &#945;&#8208;allenols. Recently, the rapid growth of radical chemistry has provided an alternative strategy to obtain &#945;&#8208;allenols through single&#8208;electron transfer. As compared to the ionic pathway, the radical pathway has clear advantages, such as mild conditions, high efficiency, and excellent selectivity control. In this review, the most important contributions for the construction of &#945;&#8208;allenols are summarized via radical intermediates by categorizing them into different types of substrates. Additionally, mechanistic studies and synthetic challenges are highlighted.

         <title>Facilitating the Isolation of Polar Natural Products: Mild 1,1&#8217;&#8208;Carbonyldiimidazole&#8208;Enabled Method for Derivatization of Acids and Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many secondary metabolites containing carboxylic acid and alcohol functional groups are highly polar and can be difficult to purify and isolate from complex extracts obtained from natural sources. The conversion of these natural products to their corresponding alkyl esters/ carbonates under mild conditions can simplify their purification and isolation. However, traditional derivatization methods have often relied on toxic and/ or corrosive reagents that can also lead to byproduct formation or epimerization in some instances. In this work, 1,1&#8242;&#8208;carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), a relatively inexpensive reagent with inherently low toxicity, is utilized to activate polar natural products containing carboxylic acids and alcohols to enable the formation of less polar species (N&#8208;acylimidazoles and N&#8208;acyloxymidazoles). These intermediates are readily converted into methyl esters and carbonates by treatment with methanol. It is anticipated that this rather simple and versatile derivatization method can facilitate the efficient isolation of secondary metabolites bearing polar carboxylic acid and alcohol residues.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the [3+2] Cycloaddition Reaction of Azomethine Ylides with Methyl Vinyl Ketone in the Triplet Excited State: A Molecular Electron Density Theory Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 24, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photochemically induced [3+2] cycloaddition of azomethine ylide with methyl vinyl ketone begins with the formation of a triplet biradical intermediate INT1 via the transition state structure TST1. The formation of the final spirooxindole SOIS0 requires intersystem crossing at INT1. The reaction in the triplet state is only 589 times faster than in the ground state.

The [3+2] cycloaddition (32CA) reaction of an azomethine ylide with methyl vinyl ketone in the ground and first triplet excited states has been studied within the framework of molecular electron density theory. A density functional theory&#8208;based reactivity analysis indicates that, while azomethine ylide behaves as a supernucleophile in both states, vinyl ketone acts as a strong electrophile. This 32CA reaction presents a very low activation energy both in the ground state, 3.40&#8201;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, and in the triplet state, 1.47&#8201;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, in the gas phase. While in the ground state, the 32CA reaction is entirely ortho regio and fully endo stereoselective, in the triplet state it is entirely ortho regioselective but only partially endo stereoselective. In the ground state, the reaction proceeds to form the spirooxindole after passing through the transition state structure, whereas in the triplet state, the reaction stops at a biradical intermediate, which requires an intersystem crossing to yield the final spirooxindole. Analysis of the kinetic parameters of the 32CA reaction in the two states in methanol indicates that in the triplet state, the reaction is only 589 times faster than in the ground state.

The total synthesis of pegaharmine I is achieved through a three&#8208;step process, featuring a key visible&#8208;light photocatalyzed nitrone formation reaction. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction confirms the structure of the natural product. Additionally, a water&#8208;promoted photocatalytic approach is developed, highlighting the potential of visible&#8208;light photocatalysis for the efficient synthesis of natural products.

The first total synthesis of pegaharmine I is accomplished by a three&#8208;step strategy featuring a visible&#8208;light&#8208;photocatalyzed nitrone formation reaction as the key step. The structure of this natural product is confirmed by crystallographic analysis. Water&#8208;promoted photocatalysis, achieved by incorporating water into the reaction medium, has also been established.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Allylation and Tandem Allylation&#8211;Cycloisomerization of Stannylated Propargyl Acetates with Allylsilanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 24, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and general method for the gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed allylation and tandem allylation&#8211;cycloisomerization of stannylated propargyl acetates with allylsilanes for the synthesis of 1,5&#8208;enynes, with a terminal alkyne, and bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes was developed. Stannylated propargyl acetates proved useful for improving the selective formation of 1,5&#8208;enynes and bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes. The tributylstannyl group is a transient protecting group that prevents side reactions.

Bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes, synthesized by the cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;enynes, serve as key scaffolds in various natural products. Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;enynes is an efficient route to bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes. However, gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed 1,5&#8208;enyne synthesis, particularly with a terminal alkyne, has not yet been fully explored. This study presents a mild and general method for the gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed allylation and tandem allylation&#8211;cycloisomerization of stannylated propargyl acetates with allylsilanes, yielding 1,5&#8208;enynes with terminal alkyne moiety and bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes. The catalytic system ((4&#8208;MeOC6H4)3PAuCl/AgSbF6) enabled the efficient synthesis of 1,5&#8208;enynes with good to high yields and regioselectivities. In addition, gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed tandem allylation&#8211;cycloisomerization using (JohnPhos)Au(MeCN)SbF6 afforded bicyclo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;2&#8208;enes with high regiocontrol. Stannylated propargyl acetates proved crucial in enhancing selectivity for both product classes.

A one&#8208;pot in situ alcohol oxidation&#8211;Wittig reaction in air using aphosphine&#8208;free Fe(II) catalyst (1) bearing a redox&#8208;active tridentate arylazo pincer was used to synthesize a broad range of substituted E olefins by dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols and phosphonium ylides. Mechanistic investigations revealed active participation of the arylazo scaffold as an electron and hydrogen reservoir in the catalytic cycle.

An iron&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot tandem in&#8201;situ oxidation&#8211;Wittig reaction is reported for the synthesis of alkenes. Using a bench&#8208;stable Fe(II) catalyst with a redox&#8208;noninnocent 2&#8208;((4&#8208;chlorophenyl)diazenyl)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligand scaffold, a broad spectrum of substituted E olefins is synthesized in good yields by the reaction of alcohols with phosphorus ylides. Control reactions and spectroscopic studies indicate synergistic participation of the ligand, which acts as a reservoir of electrons and hydrogen, during the dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols with the phosphorus ylides.

The pyrido[2,3&#8208;d]&#8208;pyrimidin&#8208;7&#8208;one template is a crucial molecular fragment in antineoplastic drug palbociclib.

         <title>Synthesis of Soluble Nickel&#8211;Salphen Ligand Complexes as Near&#8208;Infrared Dyes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 24, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five soluble nickel&#8208;salphen&#8208;type near&#8208;infrared dyes are synthesized by expanding the conjugation and introducing substituent groups. After the introduction of thiophene and electron&#8208;withdrawing terminal groups, these complexes exhibit a red shift in absorption, along with enhanced solubility in polar solvents and superior photothermal stability.

Salphen metal complexes have the advantages of simple synthesis, high stability, and excellent optical properties. However, their poor solubility, severe aggregation, and short absorption wavelengths limit their application as near&#8208;infrared dyes. In this study, five soluble Ni&#8211;salphen complexes with strong NIR absorption are synthesized by introducing alkyl chains and extending conjugated cores. The results show that the introduction of thiophene and electron&#8208;withdrawing end&#8208;groups has resulted in the red&#8208;shifted absorption of these complexes, with the absorption edge reaching 800&#8201;nm. These compounds have well solubility in organic solvents, more soluble than 8&#8201;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1 in chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, etc. The target molecules also have excellent photostability and thermal stability (Td&#8201;&gt;&#8201;325 &#176;C).

         <title>Electrochemical Fluorination of Proline Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 24, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates gem&#8208;difluorination of challenging proline substrates using electrochemical methods, both in vessel and flow, and highlights the occurrence of characteristic by&#8208;products and a higher conversion using a flow approach. Different thiol precursors are tested to identify key molecular features required for this reaction to occur.

The introduction of a fluorine into aliphatic substituents of lead candidates can impart unique structural characteristics that allow fine tuning of drug interactions; therefore, mild, specific, or late&#8208;stage fluorination procedures are of growing interest in medicinal chemistry, with the potential to be applied in F&#8208;18 radiochemistry. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of &#8220;reagent&#8208;less&#8221; electrochemical fluorination leading to mono&#8208; and gem&#8208;difluorinated proline cores featured in important fibroblast&#8208;activating protein inhibitors. Our study highlights the importance of using the appropriate activator substituents for allowing the process, the impact of different reaction parameters, and characterizes the various byproducts that are generated in the reaction. We have tested the reaction using a commercially available batch system and flow apparatus, achieving maximum yields of &gt;90% (batch) for mono&#8208; and of 6% (batch) and 9% (flow) for the gem&#8208;difluorinated proline model. These proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept results indicate that the flow approach is more efficient, but that different activating substituents will be needed to achieve higher yields.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Tetrahydropyridines via Borrowing Hydrogen Strategy</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 24, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a manganese&#8208;catalyzed borrowing hydrogen cyclization of secondary alcohols with &#947;&#8208;amino alcohols in a practical synthesis of 2,3,4,5&#8208;tetrahydropyridines is reported. A wide range of different 1&#8208;substituted ethanols&#160;and 3&#8208;amino alcohols could undergo the homogenous manganese&#8208;catalyzed process smoothly and furnish the corresponding products with overall moderate to good yields.

Tetrahydropyridines are versatile compounds widely used in organic synthesis and drug manufacturing. Herein, a manganese&#8208;catalyzed borrowing hydrogen coupling of 1&#8208;substituted ethanol derivatives with &#947;&#8208;amino alcohols is reported. This novel protocol has a broad substrate scope with good functional group tolerance and affords a diverse library of valuable 2,6&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydropyridines in moderate to good yields. Mechanistically, the reaction proceeds sequentially through catalytic dehydrogenation, dual cross&#8208;condensation, and further hydrogenation of the formed unsaturated intermediates to yield the desired tetrahydropyridines.

         <title>Total Syntheses of the Linearly&#8208;Fused Prenylated Indole Alkaloids Asperversiamides H and M via Oxidative Rearrangement of the Putative Biosynthetic Precursor Dihydrocarneamide A</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 24, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthesis of the linearly&#8208;fused prenylated indole alkaloid dihydrocarneamide A is reported and on treatment of this with a peracid it undergoes oxidative fragmentation to give a previously unreported isomer of the natural product amoenamide A. In contrast, treatment of dihydrocarneamide A with an oxaziridine afforded a mixture of the oxindole&#8208;containing natural products asperversiamides H and M.

An improved synthesis of the alkaloid dihydrocarneamide A is reported and this has been subjected to a biomimetic&#8208;type oxidative rearrangement using an oxaziridine and so affording the oxidole&#8208;containing and prenylated indole alkaloids (PIAs) asperversiamides H and M. This work serves to confirm the structure assigned to the latter. Oxidation of dihydrocarneamide A using m&#8208;chloroperbenzoic (m&#8208;CPBA) affords an oxidative fragmentation product representing the linear isomer of the PIA amoenamide A and thus a potential &#8220;natural product in&#8208;waiting&#8221;. Furthermore, oxaziridine&#8208;mediated oxidation of the epimer of dihydrocarneamide A (and the enantiomer of the structure assigned to the natural product asperversiamide F) afforded a mixture of two hitherto unreported oxindoles. Given the manner in which these last two products have been formed it seems likely that these, too, are &#8220;natural products in&#8208;waiting&#8221;. Certain cytotoxic and antimicrobial properties of key compounds are reported.

         <title>Latent Ruthenium Complexes Supported by Two N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligands: Synthesis and Catalytic Activity with Distinctive Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 24, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ruthenium complexes were synthesized and tested as latent olefin metathesis catalysts. Catalysts containing a diisopropylphenyl substituent on the NHC were thermally activated at relatively low temperatures compared to catalysts with mesitylene substituents. Complexes with mixed saturated/unsaturated NHCs excelled in high&#8208;temperature reactions with challenging substrates. UV&#8208;C light activation was successful with complexes with benzylidene ligands exclusively.

Novel bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene [NHC]) ruthenium complexes of the form (NHC1)(NHC2)Ru(=CRR')Cl2 (where NHC represents N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands and CRR&#8217; denotes Ph&#8208;indenylidene or benzylidene moieties) are prepared from second&#8208; and third&#8208;generation Grubbs catalysts. These complexes exhibit thermal latency in ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM), cross&#8208;metathesis (CM), and several ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) reactions. Upon UV&#8208;C (255&#8201;nm) irradiation, two complexes that contained benzylidene ligands prove to be highly effective for the ROMP of cyclooctadiene. The most active species incorporate IPr or SIPr as at least one NHC ligand, highlighting how bulky isopropyl substituents enhance NHC lability. Beyond their utility in UV&#8208;C&#8208;initiated ROMP, these complexes show promising activity for high&#8208;temperature CM and RCM of alkenyl&#8208;nitrile substrates.

         <dc:description>
A NHC&#8208;catalyzed radical ring opening of bicyclobutanes with readily accessible aldehydes and Togni I regents to afford 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetrasubstituted CF3&#8208;containing cyclobutanes is developed, which exhibits exclusive regioselectivity and up to excellent diastereoselectivity under mild conditions.

Herein, the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed ring opening of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) with aldehydes and Togni I reagents through a three&#8208;component radical relay process is reported, which affords 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetrasubstituted cyclobutanes. This reaction exhibits exclusive regioselectivity and up to excellent diastereoselectivity under mild and operating&#8208;simple conditions. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and several product derivatizations demonstrate their potential utilities as versatile building blocks in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Synthesis of Rhamnose&#8208;Modified Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;Containing Saponins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 24, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of triterpenoid saponins bearing a Lewis&#8208;X trisaccharide analogue, in which the fucose residue is replaced by a rhamnose, is presented. These saponins, designed as negative controls in dendritic cell&#8208;specific intercellular adhesion molecule&#8208;3&#8208;grabbing nonintegrin&#8208;targeted therapeutic applications, are prepared through iterative and convergent glycosylation strategies, achieving good overall yields and complete control over stereoselectivity.

The synthesis of betulinic acid and echinocystic acid saponins featuring an unnatural analogue of the Lewis&#8208;X trisaccharide, in which the l&#8208;fucose residue is replaced by l&#8208;rhamnose, is reported. These triterpenoid saponins are designed as negative controls for dendritic cell&#8208;specific intercellular adhesion molecule&#8208;3&#8208;grabbing nonintegrin&#8208;targeted antiviral and immunological studies. The target saponins are synthesized using both iterative and convergent strategies, requiring nine and six steps, respectively, for the longest linear sequence starting from allyl betulinate and allyl echinocystate. Glycosylation reactions are performed using trihalogenoacetimidate and thioglycoside donors, which provide excellent yields and complete control over stereoselectivity. This work establishes a robust foundation for the synthesis of lupane&#8208; and oleanane&#8208;type triterpenoid saponins incorporating Lewis&#8208;X trisaccharide analogues.

These saponins, designed as negative controls in dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin-targeted therapeutic applications, are prepared through iterative and convergent glycosylation strategies, achieving good overall yields and complete control over stereoselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of betulinic acid and echinocystic acid saponins featuring an unnatural analogue of the Lewis-X trisaccharide, in which the &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-fucose residue is replaced by &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-rhamnose, is reported. These triterpenoid saponins are designed as negative controls for dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin-targeted antiviral and immunological studies. The target saponins are synthesized using both iterative and convergent strategies, requiring nine and six steps, respectively, for the longest linear sequence starting from allyl betulinate and allyl echinocystate. Glycosylation reactions are performed using trihalogenoacetimidate and thioglycoside donors, which provide excellent yields and complete control over stereoselectivity. This work establishes a robust foundation for the synthesis of lupane- and oleanane-type triterpenoid saponins incorporating Lewis-X trisaccharide analogues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Terpenes and Terpenoids: How can we use them?</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 28, Issue 24, June 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transition from petroleum&#8208;based to renewable bio&#8208;based chemicals has led to increased interest in terpenes and terpenoids. This overview highlights their chemistry, focusing on their reactivity and applications in polymerizations, total syntheses, pharmaceuticals, and bio&#8208;based chemical conversions; promoting sustainable and green chemical processes.

As one of the twelve fundamental principles of green chemistry, the employed feedstocks in chemical processes received substantial attention over the past decades. These efforts can be attributed to Werpy's 2004 list of top&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals from biomass. Conventional fossil&#8208;based feedstocks are both depleting and environmentally damaging, leading to the transition towards renewable, bio&#8208;based platform chemicals. Terpenes and terpenoids are a group of bio&#8208;based compounds well known throughout the scientific community. Although their acquirement from natural feedstocks is well known, comprehensive overviews of their applications in synthetic&#160;chemistry remain limited. Herein, a full comprehensive overview of the reported chemistry with terpenes is provided, while specifically highlighting their reactivity. Fifteen of the most common and useful monoterpenes and terpenoids are discussed, followed by a list of the remaining known compounds belonging to this group. These fifteen compounds have been employed in a vast number of chemical transformations with different applications including: polymerizations, total syntheses, chiral reagents/auxiliaries, pharmaceuticals, and chemical conversion to other useful bio&#8208;based chemicals. The presented chemistry in this work aims to provide chemists with a useful tool that should facilitate and stimulate the search for more sustainable, renewable, and environmentally friendly starting points for novel synthesis routes.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning Gramicidin S: How &#948;&#8208;Phenylproline Affects Turns and Interaction with Membrane.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of a phenyl ring at the 5&#8208;position of proline significantly impacts the conformation and membrane interactions of Gramicidin S. In this study, we investigate the effects of incorporating cis&#8208;5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;L&#8208;proline into Gramicidin S, focusing on its structural behavior and interaction with lipid bilayers. Using a homochiral model dipeptide, we demonstrate that cis&#8208;5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;L&#8208;proline induces a double &#947;&#8208;turn, altering the peptide&#8217;s folding properties. This conformational bias is then translated into Gramicidin S, where the modified structure disrupts its natural amphipathic balance, leading to unfavorable interactions with membranes. Spectroscopic and biophysical analyses confirm that the modified peptide deviates from the native &#946;&#8208;sheet structure, likely reducing its membrane activity. These findings highlight the critical role of proline&#8208;derived structural modifications in dictating the bioactivity of cyclic peptides and provide insight into how strategic substitutions can modulate peptide&#8208;membrane interactions.</dc:description>

The work describes the copper (I)&#8208;catalyzed convenient synthesis of 5,5&#8242; bis&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles by reacting glycosyl azides with terminal alkynes using di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide (DTBP) as oxidant in refluxing toluene. The reaction proceeds through intramolecular &#8216;click&#8217; followed by Csp2&#63743; Csp2 bond formation in the successive steps under one&#8208;pot conditions. The method is further explored to access tetrakis(1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl) sialoconjugates.

The developed glycoconjugates have been characterized using extensive spectroscopic analysis, including NMR (1H &amp; 13C), IR, and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry data, and also a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray of compound 5e. Notably, the reaction proceeds in a one&#8208;pot fashion with a high atom economy, where a wide substrate scope with diversity in products finally validates the importance of the devised protocol.

         <title>Synthesis of Alkylated 1&#8208;Aryl&#8208;4,5&#8208;Dimethylimidazolium&#8208;Based Tunable Aryl Alkyl Ionic Liquids (TAAILs)</title>

         <dc:description>
New tunable aryl alkyl ionic liquids based on 2&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1&#8208;aryl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethylimidazoles are synthesized using a deprotonation protocol to directly modify imidazoles without the need to rebuild the heterocyclic core. The viscosity, conductivity, and electrochemical stability of the ionic liquids are measured.

Imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquids are one of the most important classes of ionic liquids due to their low viscosity and multitude of possible modifications. The properties of imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquids are strongly influenced by their hydrogen bond interactions, especially due to the hydrogen atoms at the core of the imidazolium cation. Herein, a new class of tunable aryl alkyl ionic liquids based on 2&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1&#8208;aryl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethylimidazoles is presented, which do not possess hydrogen atoms directly bound to the imidazolium core. They are synthesized by deprotonation of the corresponding imidazoles, avoiding the need to rebuild the imidazolium motif. Electron donating substituents at the aryl ring allow for the deprotonation at the C2&#8208;position of the imidazole ring. All ionic liquids are fully characterized (1H, 13C, 19F&#8208;NMR, EA) and their physical properties, including their viscosity, conductivity, and electrochemical stability, are examined.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Carboxylation of Aryl Boronates in Supercritical CO2</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal&#8208;free carboxylation of aryl boronates catalyzed by ZnO is achieved by using supercritical CO2. Cage&#8208;shaped cyclic trialkoxyboronates, which are both nucleophilic and soluble in supercritical CO2, undergo the carboxylation efficiently in supercritical CO2 at high pressure and temperature to give corresponding aromatic carboxylic acids with good functional group tolerance.

Carboxylation using stable and abundant CO2 as a carbon source is an attractive option in synthetic organic chemistry if the use of highly reactive organometals or toxic and expensive transition metals can be avoided. Herein a transition metal&#8208;free direct carboxylation of aryl trialkoxyboronates in supercritical CO2 (scCO2), promoted by a catalytic amount of ZnO, is reported. The use of cage&#8208;shaped trialkoxyboronates, which are both nucleophilic and soluble in scCO2, is the key to this reaction. density functional theory calculations indicate that the high pressure and high temperature of scCO2 with the ZnO catalyst compensate for the high activation energy of direct carboxylation of the boronates.

Bis(4&#8208;diphenylaminophenyl)fluorene&#8208;modified naphtho[2,3&#8208;c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (Nz) derivatives exhibit NIR emission, ambipolar charge transport properties, and good performance as fluorophores for nondoped NIR OLEDs (Von of 3.2&#8201;V, EQEmax of 2.51%, radiance of up to 23300&#8201;mW&#8201;sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2).

Herein, this study reports the synthesis and characterization of efficient ambipolar charge&#8208;carrier transporting deep&#8208;red to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores, namely MNTFT, PNTFT, and BMNTFT, based on an unsymmetric donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor&#8217; (D&#8211;A&#8211;D') structure, as well as their application as nondoped emitters in NIR organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The molecules comprise naphtho[2,3c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (Nz) as a strong acceptor, bis(4&#8208;diphenylaminophenyl)fluorene as the donor, and either diphenylamine or dimethylaminophenyl as donor'. Both experimental and theoretical investigations confirm that they exhibit hybridized local and charge transfer excited states, which enable pathways for harvesting triplet hot excitons through high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing with intense NIR emissions (&#8776;708&#8201;nm). Their unsymmetrical D&#8211;A&#8211;D&#8217; features benefit well&#8208;balanced hole and electron mobilities, resulting in their successful application as a nondoped emissive layer in OLEDs with decent performance. Particularly, the MNTFT&#8208;based nondoped device shows an NIR emission with an acceptor peak at 710&#8201;nm, a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 2.51%, and a low turn&#8208;on voltage of 3.2&#8201;V. These results represent a significant advancement in the development of NIR fluorescent materials and OLED devices, meeting key requirements for various applications.

Site&#8208;Selective C&#63743;H Amination of Lupane&#8208;Type Triterpenoids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#63743;H amination of betulin 28&#8208;O&#8208;sulfamate ester enables access to oxathiazinane&#8208;fused triterpenoids with high C16&#8208;selectivity. Sequential transformations yield 16&#8208;amino&#8208; and 16&#8208;azido derivatives, offering versatile building blocks for medicinal chemistry. Introduction of a C16&#8208;substituent directs further C&#63743;H amination to C22.

A synthetic protocol for rhodium&#8208;catalyzed, site&#8208;selective C&#63743;H amination of the betulin scaffold has been developed. Under catalytic conditions, betulin&#8208;derived 28&#8208;O&#8208;sulfamate ester undergoes intramolecular C&#63743;H amination to afford 1,2,3&#8208;oxathiazinane&#8208;2,2&#8208;dione&#8208;fused lupane triterpenoids with a C16/C22 selectivity ratio 9:1. Introduction of a C16&#8208;substituent enables a second sequential C&#63743;H amination, which occurs with C22 selectivity. Betulin&#8208;derived oxathiazinanes can be cleaved and the ring&#8208;opened products provide straightforward access to 16&#8208;amino&#8208; and 16&#8208;azido&#8208;betulin, 16&#8208;amino&#8208;betulinic, and 16&#8208;amino&#8208;betulonic acids. Betulin analogs with selectively introduced amine and azide functionalities are versatile building blocks for further medicinal chemistry applications in semisynthetic triterpenoid series.

Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced dehydrogenative spiro annulation of 2&#8208;arylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones with maleimides has been successfully developed under ambient conditions by merging Rh(III) catalysis with photoredox catalysis.

Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced, dehydrogenative spiro annulation of 2&#8208;arylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones with maleimides has been achieved at ambient conditions by merging Rh(III)&#8208;catalysis with photoredox catalysis. Various spirocyclized quinazolinone derivatives are synthesized with a broad substrate scope in up to 92% yields at room temperature. A further mechanistic study involving control experiments, UV spectroscopy, light on&#8208;off experiments, kinetic isotope effect study, H/D labeling study, and hydrogen peroxide detection tests has been explored. The present methodology is demonstrated to be effective for scale&#8208;up synthesis, enabling the efficient generation of the spirocyclic product.

         <title>Decarboxylative Michael Additions of Substituted Malonic Acid Half&#8208;Oxyesters to Methylidene Malonates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decarboxylative Michael additions between substituted malonic acids half oxyesters (SMAHOs) and methylidene malonates have been achieved using either a catalytic amount of a weak base such as N&#8208;methyl&#8208;morpholine (NMM) or di&#8208;iso&#8208;propylamine (DIPEA) in a refluxing solvent. This transformation occurs under practical conditions (bulk solvent and open to air) and can be performed with various SMAHOs and methylidene malonates, in yields ranging from 22 to 89%. NMR studies support the occurrence of a Michael addition pre&#8208;decarboxylation mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Amphiphilic Naphthalenediimides and Investigation of Their Bioimaging Potential in Large Unilamellar Vesicles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New fluorescent probes for bioimaging outlook are constantly required to in depth elucidate relevant biochemical processes and macrodomains. Among them the targeted imaging of cellular membranes is of high importance due to their complex biochemical function. In this work, a small library of amphiphilic core substituted 1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenediimides (cNDIs) has been synthesized and investigated. This approach aims to evaluate how fluorophores with the same molecular structure and hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance but bearing different small structural moieties, needed to tune their optical features, can stain the lipid bilayer membrane in large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) as cell membrane models. The photophysical properties and the partition kinetic into different LUVs have been analysed with respect to the probe structure and the specific photophysical traits related to cNDIs core substitution spanning the whole visible spectrum. The obtained results and preliminary cell imaging analyses represent versatile key data to support the design of new amphiphilic fluorescent sensors for bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <title>NHC&#8208;based Photoswitches in Catalysis: Recent Developments and Challenges</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using light as an external stimulus, photoswitchable catalysis offers the attractive opportunities to modulate the activity and selectivity of catalytic systems on demand and remotely, with high spatial and temporal precision. Consequently, the development of photoswitchable catalyst has attracted considerable attention from the chemist community in recent decades, leading to various photoresponsive species with diverse properties. Among these, only a few examples incorporate N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), despite their unique electronic and steric properties and their ubiquity in organic and organometallic catalysis. This review highlights recent advances in this emerging research area from the first reported species in 2009 to the present day, with particular emphasis on the synthesis of photoswitchable NHCs and their corresponding transition metal complexes for application in catalysis. Future perspectives in the field are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Eco&#8208;Friendly Borylation of Allylic Acetates via Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Dual&#8208;Role Base Activation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allylic boronates are valuable synthons in organic chemistry, making the development of efficient and sustainable preparation methods highly desirable. We report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed borylation of unactivated allylic acetates using a recyclable N&#8208;donor ligand system in ethyl acetate. The method employs an innovative dual&#8208;role base that simultaneously activates diboron reagents and reduces air&#8208;stable NiBr2, eliminating need for external reductants. The approach shows excellent compatibility across a diverse array of substrates, delivering the desired products with isolated yields up to 97%. Its operational simplicity is evidenced by glovebox&#8208;free conditions and successful multi&#8208;gram scale implementation (13 mmol scale, yields up to 95%), underscoring the method's practicality as a eco&#8208;friendly alternative to conventional allylic borylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Impact of Topological Variations on the Stability of the Ground Singlet and Lowest&#8208;Lying Triplet States of Catacondensed Hexabenzenoids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) like tetracenes, pentacenes, hexacenes, and some higher acenes play a central role in organic electronics due to their unique electronic properties. The impact of topological variations on the relative stability of PAH isomers in different electronic states is poorly understood, with limited insights into how Clar p&#8208;sextets and topological features like bay, cove, fjord, and K&#8208;regions influence stability in their ground singlet (S0) and lowest&#8208;lying triplet (T1) states. In this work, we perform density functional theory calculations of the S0 and T1 states of the 37 catacondensed hexabenzenoids. We use a multivariate linear regression model with relative energy as the dependent variable and a series of topological parameters as the independent variables to quantify the effect of topology in the relative stability of the catacondensed hexabenzenoids. Our analysis shows that, in S0, stability is enhanced by an increase in the number of Clar p&#8208;sextets and K&#8208;regions and decreased by the presence of coves and fjords. In T1, the main stabilizing factors are the number of Clar p&#8208;sextets and the number of rings involved in the antiaromatic region, whereas topological regions like K&#8208;edges, bays, coves, or fjords are destabilizing.</dc:description>

         <title>A Multicomponent aza&#8208;Prins Strategy for the Diastereoselective Synthesis of Piperidine Fused Dihydroquinazolinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dihydroquinazolinones and piperidines are widely acknowledged as privileged structures and are of significant interest for the development of new drug candidates. Herein we present a novel aza&#8208;Prins strategy for the synthesis of piperidine fused dihydroquinazolinones through a domino multicomponent reaction. Homoallylic ammonium halide salts were found to react with bifunctional aldehydes under acidic conditions to give halide substituted fused piperidines in a diastereoselective fashion. The reaction could be extended to the incorporation of alcohol nucleophiles via fine tuning of the reaction conditions. Finally, the utility of the substituted compounds was shown by performing a variety of functionalization reactions on the scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Convertible Groups to Expand the Substrate Scope for Pentafluorosulfanylation of Styrenes by Photocatalytic Activation of Sulfur Hexafluoride</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The redox properties of the substrates must fit to the photoredox cycle for the activation of SF6. Strong electron&#8208;donating groups turned &#945;&#8208;phenyl styrenes into a redox&#8208;inactive state. These substrates are converted into redox&#8208;active derivatives by reversible modifications of the critical substituents. This concept of redox&#8208;convertible substituents allows a significant expansion of the substrate scope.

The photocatalytic activation of sulfur hexafluoride, SF6, is an important synthetic method to access pentafluorosulfanylated organic compounds because of the nontoxic properties of this gas. However, the redox properties of the organic substrates must fit to the photoredox cycle for the activation of SF6. Strong electron&#8208;donating groups turned &#945;&#8208;phenyl styrenes into a redox&#8208;inactive state. These substrates has to be converted into redox&#8208;active derivatives by reversible modifications of the critical substituents. This concept of redox&#8208;convertible substituents has been successfully applied to expand the substrate scope for the pentafluorosulfanylation of &#945;&#8208;phenyl and &#945;&#8208;methyl styrenes by using SF6.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Asymmetric Synthesis of 2,3&#8208;Dihydrobenzofurans by [4 + 1] Annulation with Substituted Salicyl N&#8208;Phosphonyl Imines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aggregation&#8208;induced asymmetric synthesis of trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran compounds was achieved via the reaction of salicyl N&#8208;phosphonyl imines with sulfur ylide. This transformation proceeds through a [4 + 1] annulation pathway, affording products in good to excellent yields with tunable diastereoselectivities. By employing various THF/EtOH cosolvent systems in conjunction with group&#8208;assisted purification (GAP) chemistry, the conventional aggregation cosolvent systems were shown to play a crucial role in enhancing diastereoselectivity and modulating aggregate formation. This was supported by studies involving aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), aggregation&#8208;induced polarization (AIP), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The developed protocol provides a practical and versatile synthetic approach to 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran scaffolds, highlighting the utility of aggregation&#8208;induced asymmetric synthesis (AIAS) as a powerful strategy for achieving stereocontrol.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An electrochemical organic method for the direct synthesis of bis(indolyl)methane derivatives is presented, with the reaction of hydrazones and indoles. This developed approach is effective for aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroaromatic aldehydes, which react with a range of electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor indoles to produce the desired BIMs in good to excellent yields. Additionally, potential antiobesity drug was also successfully synthesized with various indole derivatives under the influence of an electric current, and the transformation of BIMs demonstrated the application potential of this protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions in Aqueous Micellar Media</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thanks to their ability to efficiently and reliably construct carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds, cross&#8208;coupling reactions remain at the forefront of chemical research in both academic and industrial settings. However, the growing emphasis on sustainability has exposed the shortcomings of cross&#8208;coupling chemistry in several areas, including the preponderance towards toxic polar aprotic solvents, high loadings of precious metal catalysts, and production of large quantities of waste. In recent years, micellar reaction media, formed by dissolution of surfactant molecules in water, have emerged as a sustainable alternative to organic solvents, allowing for use of water as the bulk medium while circumventing the usual solubility issues associated with its use. This Review introduces the fundamentals of surfactants for synthesis and summarises recent advances in cross&#8208;coupling chemistry in micellar media, with a focus on improving both sustainability and reaction performance using micellar technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox Decarboxylative 3&#8208;Fluoroallylation of &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalytic decarboxylation of &#945;&#8208;amino acids is an effective route to &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals which is also amenable to the derivatization of peptides through selective C&#8211;C bond formation at the C&#8208;terminus. We report that, in the presence of an iridium photocatalyst, allylic difluorides are suitable radical traps to capture &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals produced from &#945;&#8208;amino acids, ultimately amounting to a defluorinative 3&#8208;fluoroallylation reaction. The catalytic system was applied to the derivatization of a wide breadth of N&#8208;protected amino acids and dipeptides in high yields, and the transformation displays great functional group tolerance. &#945;&#8208;Amino acids of all substitution levels at the &#945;&#8208;carbon led to the desired products in high yields. Post&#8208;functionalization of the monofluoroalkene&#8208;containing products revealed the potential to attain fluorine&#8208;containing organic compounds of greater complexity.</dc:description>

         <title>Determination of the Transfer Rates of Porphyrins from Polysaccharide to Lipid Membranes in the Preparation of Lipid Membrane&#8208;Incorporating Porphyrins via the Host&#8208;Exchange Process</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substituents of porphyrins determine whether porphyrins will transfer from polysaccharides to liposomes by the host&#8208;exchange method. A method involving cyclodextrin&#8208;induced liposome destruction is developed for determining the transfer rates of porphyrins from polysaccharides to liposomes.

Developing straightforward and efficient methods for incorporating functional hydrophobic guest molecules into lipid membranes is essential for the application of liposomes as drug delivery systems. In a previous study, the preparation of lipid&#8208;membrane&#8208;incorporated C60, C60 derivatives, and C70 (LMICx) was reported through a host&#8208;exchange method, wherein these molecules were transferred from &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin to liposomes. Herein, a similar host&#8208;exchange approach is applied to prepare lipid&#8208;membrane&#8208;incorporated porphyrins (LMIPors), transferring porphyrins from polysaccharides to liposomes. However, until now, there has been no means to determine the transfer rates. To determine the transfer rates of porphyrins from polysaccharides to liposomes, a method involving the collapse of LMIPors via complex formation between lipids and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin is developed. It is believed that this method is general and can be deployed to liposomes incorporating various guest molecules prepared as drug delivery systems on the host&#8208;exchange process.

         <title>Photochemical Synthesis of 2,6&#8208;Linked Anthracene Oligomers without Introducing Extra Substituents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates a photochemical method to synthesize 2,6&#8208;linked anthracene oligomers, addressing solubility challenges and achieving efficient &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Using photochemical precursors, selective photoirradiation converts them into oligomers, highlighting the versatility of this method. This approach allows for the synthesis of thin films, offering new applications in organic electronics.

Photoconvertible precursors of 2,6&#8208;linked anthracene oligomers (trimer, tetramer, and pentamer) are synthesized through repeated Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Upon exposure of these precursors to light at 450&#8201;nm, which corresponds to the n&#8211;&#960;* transition of diketone moieties, yellow precipitates are formed, suggesting the conversion to the corresponding anthracene oligomers from the precursors. The disappearance of 1H nuclear magnetic resonance peaks after photoirradiation indicates the formation of anthracene oligomers with less solubility. High&#8208;resolution (HR) mass spectrometry evidently indicates the oligomer formations, and infrared (IR) spectral analysis for thin films show the disappearance of peaks originating from the carbonyl groups, also supporting the conversion. The absorption spectra after photoirradiation indicate a red shift in the absorption peaks accompanying oligomer formations, suggesting an extension of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. The low solubility of the resulting anthracene oligomers in organic solvents highlights the effectiveness of this synthetic strategy using the photoconvertible precursor. This study provides a practical method to synthesize acene oligomers without the introduction of extra substituents.

         <title>Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocyclic&#8208;Cyclobutane&#8208;Fused Bicyclic &#947;&#8208;Lactones from 2&#8208;Hydroxycyclobutanone and Carboxamide&#8208;Bearing Wittig Reagents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of 2&#8208;hydroxycyclobutanone with a Wittig reagent bearing a benzooxazolone moiety results in the formation of a cyclobutane&#8208;fused bicyclic &#947;&#8208;lactone with the heterocyclic unit located at the bridgehead position. The proposed mechanism involves the transfer of the acyl ylide fragment and an intramolecular Wittig reaction to provide an intermediate butanolide, followed by an aza&#8208;Michael addition with the free heterocyclic component.

A cascade reaction has been established that enables access to structurally diverse 2&#8208;oxabicyclo[3.2.0]heptan&#8208;3&#8208;ones bearing a benzo[d]oxazol&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;one moiety at the bridgehead quaternary center in moderate to good yields in a single operation. The reaction illustrates the potential of 2&#8208;hydroxycyclobutanone as a substrate for the rapid preparation of unusual and complex molecular frameworks.

         <title>Nitrile N&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Based Fluorescent Probe to Impart Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission to Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent probes have been used extensively in chemical biology. However, there are a few fluorescence probes that covalently bind to less polar compounds without a catalyst. Herein, the design, synthesis, and click reaction of pyrene&#8208;based nitrile N&#8208;oxide (Pyrene&#8208;NO) are reported. The optical properties of the adducts of Pyrene&#8208;NO indicate that Pyrene&#8208;NO imparts the aggregation&#8208;induced emission behaviors to alkene&#8208;containing compounds.

Fluorescent probes have been used extensively in chemical biology, allowing the visual observation of bioactive compounds. While many variations of fluorescent probes that react to polar functional groups have been developed, there are few fluorescent probes that directly modify less polar compounds. In this article, pyrene&#8208;containing nitrile N&#8208;oxide (Pyrene&#8208;NO) has been designed and synthesized as a fluorescent dye clickable to alkenes without a catalyst. Pyrene&#8208;NO shows good reactivity to a terminal alkene, a polymer methacrylate, and a natural unsaturated lipid with internal alkenes to give the corresponding cycloadducts with pyrene as the fluorescent dye. The cycloadducts show aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behaviors in a poor solvent. While the adducts to 1&#8208;hexene or polymer methacrylate show AIE in water, the adduct to castor oil, as a natural glycerolipid, shows AIE in MeOH. The AIE behaviors are evidenced by the dependence of fluorescence intensity on the concentration and the enhanced fluorescence at 77&#8201;K compared with that at room temperature. It is suggested that the aggregation of the cycloadduct in the poor solvent would kinetically suppress the nonradiative deactivation of the excited state of pyrene based on interactions with oxygen, leading to an increase in fluorescence intensity.

         <title>Green Approach for Copper&#8208;Free Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira Cross&#8208;Coupling using Saponin&#8208;Based Micellar Catalysis in Water at Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A micellar catalysis that is derived from commercially available saponin for copper&#8208;free, Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling under mild reaction conditions has been developed. Using this green and sustainable method, a broad range of aryl/heteroaryl and alkyl terminal alkynes were cross&#8208;coupled with aryl/heteroaryl halides at ambient temperature in an aqueous medium. The commercially available, inexpensive, and plant&#8208;based natural saponin served as a surfactant for a micellar system that effectively enabled C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp) cross&#8208;coupling with a wide range of substrates. The attractive features of this protocol are the use of water as a reaction medium, the in&#8208;situ generation of the micellar&#8208;catalysis system from biodegradable natural saponins, good functional group tolerance, scalability of the products, and notably the ability to retain the catalyst activity by recycling the aqueous reaction medium.</dc:description>

Herein, we describe an efficient method to access various cyclohepta[b]pyridine derivatives through formal higher&#8208;order [8+3] cycloaddition of azaheptafulvenes with donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes catalyzed by Yb(OTf)3. This method exhibited broad substrate accommodation and gave the corresponding products in high yields and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen peroxide &#8208; responsive aminoferrocene prodrugs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aminoferrocene (AF)&#8208;based prodrugs are activated in cancer cells through reactions with H&#8322;O&#8322; and other reactive oxygen species (ROS), generating electron&#8208;rich AF&#8217;s. These, in turn, induce the production of highly toxic O2&#183;&#8208; and HO&#183;, leading to cancer cell death. Effective activation of these prodrugs depends on their ability to target intracellular organelles rich in ROS, as non&#8208;targeted prodrugs are practically inactive. In this study, we replaced the boronic acid pinacol ester&#8212;previously used as a ROS&#8208;trigger&#8212;with an &#945;&#8208;ketoamide fragment, which is more selective and sensitive to H&#8322;O&#8322;. This modification enhanced the anticancer efficacy of untargeted AF prodrugs, reducing the IC&#8325;&#8320; from 23.9&#8211;35.5 &#956;M (previously reported prodrug 13b) to 5&#8211;6.4 &#956;M (new prodrug 2a) in human ovarian cancer A2780 and Burkitt&#8217;s lymphoma BL&#8208;2 cells. Further analysis confirmed that the anticancer effect of 2a is driven by its ability to markedly increase intracellular ROS levels in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Halogenation&#160;of Aromatic and Heteroaromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The halogenation of aromatic and heteroaromatic systems has attracted considerable attention in recent decades owing to the importance of haloaromatics in biologically relevant compounds and their role as essential building blocks for more complex systems. In recent years, various research groups have explored the challenge of developing new synthetic methodologies for electrophilic halogenation. Nevertheless, these methods continue to encounter several challenges, such as waste products from halogenating agents, toxic or contaminating reagents, and problems with low regioselectivity, with polyhalogenation&#8212;often the predominant side reaction&#8212;occurring in some cases. In this context, organocatalysis has emerged as a promising approach to address these limitations. This review highlights key organocatalytic strategies reported in the last 14 years and discusses experimental aspects, mechanisms, and selectivity issues in chlorination, bromination, fluorination, and iodination of aromatic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Point&#8208;to&#8208;axis optical activity induction in extended, sterically congested chromophoric systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The readily available, modular and electronic circular dichroism (ECD)&#8208;silent derivatives of terephthalaldehyde (the probes) have exhibited an induced optical activity upon condensation with chiral primary amines. The central unit of the probe serves as an amine binder by forming imine bonds and is flanked by two extended chromophoric units (&#8220;the wings&#8221;). Modification of the wings by diphenylamine or carbazole units affects the sterical and spectroscopic properties of the probes. An increase in sterical congestion within the probe core resulted in a change in the mechanism of optical activity induction. In the more congested systems, the point&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transmission from the chiral amine (the inducer) to the chromophoric system led to the adaptation of helical conformation by &#8220;the wings&#8221; and the appearance of non&#8208;zero Cotton effects (CEs) in the low&#8208;energy part of the ECD spectrum. However, the sterically congested probes were sensitive to the chirality of the inducers but relatively indifferent to the differences in their structure. Thus, the chirality of the inducers triggers conformational change towards the thermodynamically preferred conformational diastereoisomer due to the probe's &#8212;1 &#8208; +1 operation scheme.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Photoredox &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8211;H Alkynylation of Cyclic Amines Under Visible Light</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A direct visible&#8208;light &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8211;H bond alkynylation of N&#8208;aryl pyrrolidine derivatives with 1&#8208;bromoalkynes has been developed, enabling the synthesis of propargylic amines. This transformation utilizes&#160;[Ru(bpy)3]Cl2&#183;6H2O&#160;as a photocatalyst, driven by blue LED (455 nm) irradiation. Detailed mechanistic studies and cyclic voltammetry support the proposed reaction pathway, where the C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp) bond formation occurs via the oxidation of &#945;&#8208;amino radicals, followed by a radical coupling with 1&#8208;bromoalkynes. This approach offers a straightforward, efficient, and selective method for synthesizing a wide range of cyclic &#945;&#8208;aminoalkynes, yielding moderate to good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Estimation of Ring Opening of Cyclopropylvinyl Radical Using Radical Substitution Reaction on at the Tin Atom</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present study investigated kinetic estimation of cyclopropylvinyl radical. Treatment of cyclopropane&#8208;substituted 1,6&#8208;enyne with Bu3SnH resulted in multi&#8208;component radical cascade reaction, which commenced with addition of Bu3Sn radical to unsaturated amide followed by 5&#8208;exo&#8208;radical cyclization, generating cyclopropylvinyl radical intermediate. The intermediate then underwent either the ring cleavage of the adjacent cyclopropane ring, yielding the allene product, or the formation of dihydrostannole which was formed through direct radical substitution on a tin atom. The reaction path depended on the concentration of Bu3SnH. We applied this cascade process for a mechanistic probe to explore the radical reaction, and estimated kinetic parameters of the ring cleavage of the cyclopropylvinyl radical, which has not been well investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>Reaction of Nitrones with Phosphinylallenes: DFT Mechanistic Investigations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction between phosphinylallenes and nitrones efficiently leads to 4&#8208;phosphinylpyrrolidin&#8208;3&#8208;ones. The mechanism involved in this reaction was theoretically studied to understand the overall pathway and the stereochemical outcome of the transformation. The first step of the mechanism is a (3+2) cycloaddition between the nitrone and the allene delivering an isoxazolidine ylidene intermediate. This never isolated intermediate undergoes a spontaneous rearrangement to the final 4&#8208;phosphinylpyrrolidin&#8208;3&#8208;one through the homolytic N&#8211;O bond cleavage followed by rotation and C&#8211;N recombination of the biradical intermediate. The computational results obtained from this study are highly informative for potentially obtaining diastereoisomerically and enantiomerically pure 4&#8208;phosphinylpyrrolidin&#8208;3&#8208;ones by a judicious choice of substituents on nitrone and allene.</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying the True Catalyst: A Mn(II) Salt versus&#160;Mn(II) Complexes in Epoxidation with m&#8208;Chloroperbenzoic Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidant meta&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid (m&#8208;CPBA) is used widely for the epoxidation of alkenes, yet its efficiency is often limited under ambient conditions. In this study we investigate the catalytic activity of a Mn(II) salt and mononuclear Mn(II) complexes, two of which are reported here for the first time, in the epoxidation of alkenes with m&#8208;CPBA under ambient conditions. Time&#8208;resolved Raman spectroscopy was used to monitor substrate conversion, oxidant consumption, and product formation. The data reveal that simple Mn(II) salts exhibit significantly higher catalytic activity than Mn(II) complexes, indicating that ligand coordination inhibits the reactivity of the manganese centre. The catalytic efficiency of Mn(II) perchlorate was particularly notable, achieving near&#8208;complete oxidation of styrene within minutes under mild conditions. Furthermore, epoxidation of a range of alkenes demonstrated that Mn(II) salts provide broad substrate scope and high selectivity. These findings suggest that simple Mn(II) salts can serve as highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective catalysts in alkene epoxidations with m&#8208;CPBA.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free HFIP&#8208;Promoted Synthesis of Benzhydryl Derivatives from Stilbenes as Masked Electrophiles under Oxidative Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An umpolung strategy allowing the use of stilbenes as electrophiles in substitution reactions is developed that relies on a combination of m&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid and hexafluoroisopropanol. This new step&#8208;economic approach gives rise to benzhydryl derivatives by the use of different nitrogenated, oxygenated, and sulfur&#8208; and carbon&#8208;based nucleophiles.

Benzhydryl derivatives are synthesized by a new strategy involving the use of stilbenes as an electrophilic reaction partner through umpolung reactivity in a nucleophilic substitution reaction. The transformation, which requires oxidative treatment with meta&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid and the presence of 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) as an essential solvent and reaction promoter, occurs through multiple consecutive steps. Under these conditions, different benzhydryl derivatives are synthesized by coupling stilbenes with a variety of nitrogenated, oxygenated, and sulfur&#8208; and carbon&#8208;based nucleophiles.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of dinucleoside analogues with a &#8220;pyrenyl&#8208;triazole&#8208;N&#8208;(triazole)2&#8221; linker substituting the natural phosphodiester linkage. The compounds were obtained stepwise with the copper&#8208;catalyzed Huisgen (3+2) azide alkyne cycloaddition reaction of azidopyrene&#160;&#160;tripropargylamine, and the respective nucleoside azide. Due to the presence of the pyrenyl entity, compounds show unimolecular (in diluted solutions) or excimer (at higher concentrations and in the solid state) emission. Luminescence allowed to track their spatial distribution inside living MCF&#8208;7 cells by using confocal microscopy. The compounds showed am affinity to lipid membranes and localize in a form of granules or larger aggregates in the area of the cytosol including, in particular, the perinuclear region. Representative nucleoside was appended to the 5&#8217;&#8208;terminus of the deoxyribonucleotide 5&#8217;&#8208;d(TTT CTT TCC CTC)&#8208;3&#8217;. The resulting conjugate forms stable B&#8208;type DNA duplex with complementary oligonucleotide.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report the first synthesis of pentafluorosulfanylated oxazoles through a gold(I) catalyzed cyclization of SF5&#8208;alkynes and nitriles. We describe 17 examples of 4&#8208;SF5&#8208;oxazoles with NMR yield ranging from 3% to 75%. While the isolation of the pure pentafluorosulfanylated oxazoles proved challenging, the fluorinated heterocycles could nonetheless be obtained in yields between 14 and 52%, opening the door for their use as a novel fluorine&#8208;containing scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a Selena&#8208;Hybrid [5]Radialene Derivative and Exploration of Polycyclic Heteroterphenoquinones as Ambipolar Charge Carriers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polycyclic heteroterphenoquinone with an embedded selenophenoradialene moiety is synthesized and its properties studied, including hole and electron mobilities alongside those of its thia&#8208;counterpart.

para&#8208;Terphenoquinone (pTPQ) in which a benzenoid ring has been replaced with a heterocycle is known as heteroterphenoquinone (HTPQ). While (H)TPQs are typically non&#8208;emissive and potentially open&#8208;shell species, it is recently reported that fully fused polycyclic HTPQs (or PHTPQs) bearing a sulfur heteroatom can either exhibit fluorescence or antiaromaticity depending on the &#960;&#8208;conjugation arrangement in the core. Since the synthesis of PHTPQs is rare, until now limited to the reported compound containing a sulfur atom, a selenium&#8208;containing fluorescent PHTPQ is now synthesized while attempting the isolation of elusive dinaphtho&#8208;dicyclopenta[b,d]selenophene. The fluorescent PHTPQ is further dehydrogenated to synthesize the first PHTPQ with an embedded selenophenoradialene (selena&#8208;hybrid [5]radialene), which is found to exhibit antiaromatic properties. The narrow optical highest occupied molecular orbital&#8211;lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO&#8211;LUMO) gap, short intermolecular interactions in the solid state, and redox amphoterism prompt the investigation of its ambipolar charge transport properties alongside the thia&#8208;analogue. The electron mobilities for PHTPQs comprising selenaradialene (1.96&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;3&#8201;cm2&#8202;&#8201;&#8202;V&#8722;1&#8202;&#8201;&#8202;s&#8722;1) and thiaradialene (1.58&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;3&#8201;cm2&#8202;&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;&#8202;s&#8722;1) cores are found to be one order of magnitude higher than that of the holes due to low&#8208;lying LUMO energy levels.

Since the synthesis of PHTPQs is rare, until now limited to the reported compound containing a sulfur atom, a selenium-containing fluorescent PHTPQ is now synthesized while attempting the isolation of elusive dinaphtho-dicyclopenta[&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]selenophene. The fluorescent PHTPQ is further dehydrogenated to synthesize the first PHTPQ with an embedded selenophenoradialene (selena-hybrid [5]radialene), which is found to exhibit antiaromatic properties. The narrow optical highest occupied molecular orbital&#8211;lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO&#8211;LUMO) gap, short intermolecular interactions in the solid state, and redox amphoterism prompt the investigation of its ambipolar charge transport properties alongside the thia-analogue. The electron mobilities for PHTPQs comprising selenaradialene (1.96&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8202;&#8201;&#8202;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8202;&#8201;&#8202;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and thiaradialene (1.58&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8202;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8202;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) cores are found to be one order of magnitude higher than that of the holes due to low-lying LUMO energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The mechanism of the reaction was established through DFT calculation and by trapping of the oxygen radical intermediate A with BHT, which was confirmed through 1H, 13C NMR spectra and HRMS. This process forms the highly fused hexacyclic heteroaromatics without requiring any metal catalyst or dehydrogenating agent.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Catalytic Access to Indanes via Intermolecular Cyclization from Internal Olefins/Ethers and Mechanism Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A green and sustainable protocol has been developed for metal&#8208;free synthesis of substituted indanes through Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular cyclization. Employing the acidic ionic liquid [BsPy][OTf] as a catalyst, this methodology achieved good selectivities to synthesize substituted indanes through intermolecular cyclization of benzyl ethers and internal olefins while eliminating metallic reagents, halogens, and post&#8208;reaction neutralization steps. Moreover, the acidity of ionic liquids was one of the significant factors affecting the yield and the selectivity. [BsPy][OTf] exhibited good selectivity and activity, and also had excellent recyclability. Controlling experiments revealed a carbocation&#8208;mediated pathway. DFT calculation indicated that the selectivity of indane as cyclization product is supported by both thermodynamics and kinetics&#160; catalyzed by [BsPy][OTf], and the product is determined to be substituted olefin controlled by kinetics using [MeBs(dio)TMP][OTf] as the catalyst. Moreover, the distance of C1&#8943;C5 to construct the indane ring is shorter and more readily to occur via cyclization path in [BsPy][OTf]&#8208;catalyzed system compared with that of [MeBs(dio)TMP][OTf].</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Using (Z)&#8208;3&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;chloropropenals, we have developed an efficient route for the stereoselective synthesis of unsymmetrical 3,3&#8208;diarylpropenals in high yield with very good retention of stereochemistry. Consequently, we have found an efficient route for the stereoselective synthesis of 3,3&#8208;diarylpropenoic acids which are precursors to 4&#8208;arylcoumarins. The Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling of (Z)&#8208;3&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;chloropropenals with arylboronic acid derivatives yields unsymmetric 3,3&#8208;diarylpropenals in high yields with excellent retention of stereochemistry. These 3,3&#8208;diarylpropenals are then oxidized to the corresponding acrylic acids, and lactonized to form 4&#8208;arylcoumarins.&#160;&#160;The lactonization reaction consistently occurs with the aryl group that is cis to the acid group, i.e. with the aryl group that is introduced in the Suzuki coupling step. Thus, the stereochemical retention of the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling step results in the ability to make a diverse catalogue of 4&#8208;arylcoumarins with complete stereoselective control. A variety of 4&#8208;arylcoumarins were synthesized via this route with several different aryl substituents at both positions with good yields and excellent stereochemical purity.</dc:description>

An efficient method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;fluorobenzamides is established from 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazinone using tetrafluoroboric acid under thermal and photochemical conditions.

An efficient method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;fluorobenzamides is established from 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazinones using tetrafluoroboric acid. The reactions proceed under mild thermal conditions, providing a wide range of functionalized 2&#8208;fluorobenzamides in 65%&#8211;80% yields. On the other hand, the reaction proceeds with 58%&#8211;63% yields at room temperature under visible light using blue LED conditions. Simple operation, metal&#8208;free conditions, and broad substrate scope are the benefits of the developed methodology.

         <title>Amino&#8208;Acid&#8208;Encoded Enantioselective Photocatalysis in Self&#8208;Assembled Porphyrin&#8211;Amino Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the excellent photocatalytic ability of porphyrin and the chiral advantage of amino acids, porphyrin has been modified using amino acids. The porphyrin&#8211;amino acids can exhibit opposite trends in enantioselectivity in the photocatalytic oxidation of tyrosine reaction. Moreover, the porphyrin&#8211;phenylalanine derivatives with carboxyl&#8208;terminal groups catalyze 700.10% more dityrosine in d&#8208;type substrates than in l&#8208;type substrates.

Porphyrin&#8208;based nanomaterials have attracted much attention in photocatalysis due to their excellent photoelectrocatalytic ability and strong intermolecular interaction forces. Herein, a series of chiral assemblies of porphyrin&#8211;amino acid derivatives are prepared by linking different types of amino acids with terminal modifications to tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin via covalent bonding and their catalytic ability in enantioselective photocatalytic oxidation of tyrosine is investigated. The results show that the amino acid type and terminal groups significantly affect the macroscopic assembly morphology and microscopic chiral space of the porphyrin&#8211;amino acid derivatives, which is consistent with the results of molecular dynamics simulations and further impacts the rate and enantioselectivity of tyrosine chiral photocatalytic oxidation. These results provide new avenues for applying porphyrin derivatives in chiral photocatalysis.

         <title>Organic photocatalyst Eosin Y catalyzes the formation of C&#8208;S bonds under visible light</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of green and efficient C&#8208;S bond formation methods has received significant attention from synthetic chemists because the C&#8208;S bonds widely occurs in many important drugs and natural biological compounds. In recent years, photochemical organic conversion promoted by visible light has attracted the interest of many organic chemists. Compared with the traditional methods, visible light as the photoredox catalysis of renewable energy has been proved to be a mild and powerful tool that can promote the activation of organic molecules through the single electron transfer (SET) process. Therefore, this strategy has been widely applied in the formation of C&#8208;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. This article reviews the research results on the formation of carbon sulfur bond promoted by organic photocatalyst Eosin Y under visible light in recent years, and discusses representative examples and reaction mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Atropisomeric Diarylamines Enabled by Bromine&#8208;Masked Indolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the use of a bromine atom as a masking group for the synthesis atropisomeric diarylamines via N&#8208;arylation of 7&#8208;bromoindolines. The bromine atom acts as a bulky group to temporarily stabilize the configuration by steric hindrance. Upon unmasking, less sterically hindered diarylamines are obtained, with configurational stability potentially maintained through intramolecular hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
Herein, we report the use of a bromine atom as a masking group for the synthesis atropisomeric diarylamines via organocatalytic N&#8208;arylation of 7&#8208;bromoindolines. The bromine atom acts as a bulky group to temporarily stabilize the configuration by steric hindrance. Upon unmasking, less sterically hindered diarylamines are obtained, with configurational stability potentially maintained through intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Moreover, the gram&#8208;scale reaction and post&#8208;modifications of the axially chiral diarylamines demonstrated the utility of this protocol. Thermal racemization experiments combined with X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed the respective contributions of steric repulsion and intramolecular hydrogen bonding in stabilizing the configurations. This approach not only provides a useful method for the atroposelective construction of conical diarylamines, but also paves the way for a better understanding of stable axial chirality and its role in shaping chemical reactivity and biological activity.

         <dc:description>A cyclobutane ring constitutes an interesting scaffold for the development of new materials and drugs. In this work we describe the [2+2] cycloaddition of chalconoid precursors bearing fluorinated and heterocyclic moieties to produce cyclobutane derivatives in solution. The reaction is promoted by sunlight and does not require any added photocatalyst. The regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity output depends on the heteroaromatic system and the number of fluorine atoms. Experimental results and DFT calculations support a mechanism through the formation of an EDA complex between two molecules of the chalconoid.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure of Geminal Diol&#8211;Type Intermediates and Their Reactivity in Modern Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gem&#8208;diols, as crucial intermediates in organic reactions, have been characterized using advanced analytical methodologies. This concept systematically examines the thermodynamic stability and synthetic accessibility of gem&#8208;diol&#8208;type structures, focusing on their reactivity in organic synthesis and their utility in mechanistic studies.

Geminal diol (gem&#8208;diol) moieties commonly exist in equilibrium with ketones or aldehydes when water is present in the system. While significant progress has been made in their structural characterization, recent studies have increasingly focused on the reactivity of gem&#8208;diol intermediates. In parallel, gem&#8208;diol&#8208;type hydroxyl&#8208;oxoammonium species have been reported as key intermediates in various reactions. Accordingly, this concept highlights recent advances in the structural elucidation of gem&#8208;diol&#8208;type intermediates and, more importantly, discusses their reactivity and potential application in organic reactions. In addition to typical gem&#8208;diol species, the discussion also encompasses other gem&#8208;diol&#8208;type species with O&#63743;C(sp3)&#63743;O or O&#63743;N(sp3)&#63743;O centers derived from C(sp2)&#63742;O or N(sp2)&#63742;O centers, respectively. The ultimate aim is to inspire the development of more efficient strategies for employing such gem&#8208;diol&#8208;type intermediates in organic synthesis.

         <title>Bis&#8208;Tetrasubstituted Centers Forming Formal [3&#8201;+&#8201;3] Cycloaddition Reaction via Bifunctional Organocatalysis: Synthesis of Spiro&#8208;Oxindoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method has been developed for Michael/electrophilic substitution cascade reaction via bifunctional organocatalysis to synthesize a diverse array of spiro&#8208;oxindole derivatives bearing bis&#8208;tetrasubstituted carbon centers, achieving high yields and exceptional diastereoselectivities. This strategy, in conjunction with traditional metal catalysis, facilitates the switchable, chemodivergent synthesis of spiro&#8208;oxindoles.

An efficient method has been developed for Michael/electrophilic substitution cascade reaction between 3&#8208;pyrrolyl&#8208;oxindoles and unsaturated ketoesters, utilizing bifunctional organocatalysis. This approach enables the synthesis of a diverse array of spiro&#8208;oxindole derivatives bearing three stereogenic centers, two of them quaternary, achieving high yields and exceptional diastereoselectivities. Furthermore, the resulting products can be readily converted into tetrahydropyridine skeletons through an elimination process in one pot. This strategy, in conjunction with traditional metal catalysis, facilitates the switchable, chemodivergent synthesis of spiro&#8208;oxindoles, offering significant synthetic flexibility and potential for broader applications.

         <title>Insight on p&#8208;Acetoxybenzyl Carbonate as an Orthogonal Hydroxyl Protecting Group in Oligosaccharide Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new protecting group can be easily installed in one synthetic step and selectively removed by using catalytic amounts of ytterbium(III) triflate at room temperature. Moreover, this new protecting group is orthogonal with tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS), p&#8208;methoxybenzyl (PMB), acetonides, and benzylidenes groups. Finally, the new protecting group is applied to oligosaccharide synthesis to prove their stability under glycosylation conditions.

This study describes the utility of p&#8208;acetoxybenzyl carbonate (ABC) group for the protection of hydroxyl functions. This hydroxyl protecting group can be easily prepared using inexpensive commercially available 4&#8208;hydroxybenzyl alcohol as the starting material. The ABC group can be selectively removed through ytterbium(III) triflate&#8208;catalyzed transesterification at room temperature without affecting commonly used acid&#8208;cleavable protecting groups, such as tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS), p&#8208;methoxybenzyl (PMB), acetonide, and benzylidenes. Notably, the ABC protecting group is stable under glycosylation conditions in oligosaccharide synthesis.

Enantioselective Desymmetrization of Bisphenol Derivatives by Organocatalytic Sulfonylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient organocatalytic strategy involving the desymmetrization&#8211;sulfonylation of bisphenols is introduced for the synthesis of chiral 1,1&#8208;diarylalkanes. A chiral thiourea catalyst enables the selective sulfonylation of one hydroxyl group with a sulfonyl chloride in a CHCl3/H2O system under basic conditions, affording the reaction products with high yields and enantioselectivities.

Chiral 1,1&#8208;diarylalkanes are synthesized by enantioselective desymmetrization of bisphenol derivatives through an organocatalytic sulfonylation reaction. The methodology involves the selective sulfonylation of one enantiotopic hydroxyl group of a bisphenol using a sulfonyl chloride with a chiral thiourea catalyst in a CHCl3/H2O system under basic conditions. The resulting products are obtained in good to high yields (up to 97%) with high enantioselectivity (up to 90.5:9.5 er). Remarkably, compounds that are almost enantiomerically pure can be obtained from the mother liquor after crystallization.

         <title>Streamlining Vorinostat Synthesis: A Chemoenzymatic Continuous Flow Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoenzymatic protocol for the synthesis of histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat has been established. Immobilized lipase from C. antarctica (imm&#8208;CaLB) allowed the functionalization of suberanoyl acid 1 and further conversion to vorinostat via ion&#8208;exchange resin treatment. The continuous flow system affords vorinostat in high yield, avoiding chromatographic purifications, shortening the reaction time and minimizing solvent usage and waste production.

Anticancer agent vorinostat is one of the only three commercialized histone deacetylase inhibitors approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of cutaneous T&#8208;cell lymphoma. Several synthetic pathways and only one biocatalytic approach have been designed over the years. However, no chemoenzymatic approaches have been described to date. Herein, the first two&#8208;step protocol for the obtainment of vorinostat is presented, which combines the chemical acylation of aniline followed by the lipase&#8208;catalyzed (immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica) condensation and the final hydrolysis with an acidic resin. Initially, batch studies allow to obtain vorinostat in high yield (70%) in 16&#8201;h using eco&#8208;friendly t&#8208;amyl alcohol as the reaction medium. Subsequently, the protocol is transferred to a continuous flow reactor, which reduces the overall time to 4&#8201;h while keeping the same final yield. Furthermore, the developed procedure minimizes solvent waste and enhances system automation, paving the way for a feasible application to further hydroxamic acid moieties of pharmaceutical interest.

         <title>Photoinduced Copper&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Arylation Reaction of N&#63743;H Heteroarenes Using Aryl Thianthrenium Salts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted copper&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;arylation protocol is described that enables direct C&#63743;N bond construction between N&#63743;H heteroarenes and arenes by the use of aryl thianthrenium salts. This photoactivation strategy demonstrates extensive substrate scope and offers a means to retain an activated functional group (such as Br, CHO, and CN) for subsequent derivatization reactions.

Herein, an efficient photoinduced copper&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;arylation reaction is presented, which occurs through the cross&#8208;coupling of N&#63743;H heteroarenes with aryl thianthrenium salts (Ar&#8208;TTs). This photoactivation strategy exhibits broad substrate scope and offers a method for preserving activated functional groups (such as Br, CHO, and CN) for subsequent derivatization reactions.

Fluorescent Bis&#8208;Dihydropyridine Hybrids: Design, Synthesis, and Redox Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, photophysical, and electrochemical properties of hybrid derivatives of nonsymmetrical bis&#8208;dihydropyridines are described. These compounds are obtained by multicomponent Hantzsch ester synthesis followed by a click reaction. Interestingly, photophysical and electrochemical properties of this class of compounds will allow them to be considered for potential applications in biological processes and their potential antioxidant activity.

A set of eight fluorescent symmetric and nonsymmetric bis&#8208;dihydropyridine hybrid molecules (DHP&#8211;DHP) are designed and synthesized through the sequential multicomponent Hantzsch ester synthesis followed by the azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition reaction methodology with the formation of a nonenolizable triazole linker between the two dihydropyridine portions. The luminescence properties are evaluated by absorption and fluorescence emission (steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved) techniques, aided by density functional theory calculations. The redox properties of this new series of DHP derivatives are also evaluated.

         <title>NNN Palladium(II)Pincer Complex in a Borrowing Hydrogen Process: Alkylation of Indoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NNN&#8211;Pd(II) pincer complex is utilized in the selective synthesis of C3&#8208;alkylated indoles as well as the synthesis of bis(indolyl)methanes by tuning the reaction conditions using the same substrates. The control experiments and quantum chemical analysis suggest that C3 functionalization of indole involves a &#8220;borrowing hydrogen process.&#8221;

Recently, an azine NNN&#8211;Pd(II) nonpalindromic pincer complex is generated, and its application in acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling is explored. This article establishes the application of the same pincer complex in the borrowing hydrogen process (BHP). Herein, the selective synthesis of C3 alkylated indoles (CAIs) is reported. Remarkably, this catalyst enables the synthesis of bis(indolyl)methanes (BIMs) by tuning the reaction conditions using the same substrates. The control experiments and quantum chemical analysis suggest that C3 functionalization of indole involves BHP. The formation of BIMs is an additional advantage.

         <title>Photoinduced Reaction of Diiodoperfluoroalkanes with Aromatic Compounds: Divergent Synthesis of Two Product Types</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of aromatic compounds with diiodoperfluoroalkanes are investigated, and it is found that different products can be synthesized depending on the reaction conditions and amounts of reagents. In particular, the reaction of 1,4&#8208;diiodoperfluorobutane under UV irradiation provides unique cyclic perfluoroalkyl aromatic compounds.

Both UV&#8208;light&#8208;promoted and organic&#8208;dye&#8208;catalyzed visible light&#8208;promoted reactions of diiodoperfluoroalkanes with an iodine substituent at both ends and substituted anilines are attempted. In the reactions with 1,6&#8208; and 1,8&#8208;diiodoperfluoroalkanes in the presence of an excess amount of aniline, both ends of the iodide reacts to give a diamine, and the reaction with an excess amount of diiodide gives a monoiodide, in which one end of the diiodide has reacted with the aniline. In contrast, in the case of the 1,4&#8208;diiodoperfluoroalkane, the UV reaction yields cyclization products in which both ends of the diiodine has reacted with the same aromatic ring, while the visible light reaction yields products in which only one end has reacted. Since synthetic examples of such cyclization products are limited, the reaction with various aromatic compounds is tried and it has been shown that it is effective for electron&#8208;rich aromatic rings. The mechanism of these reactions is discussed and the importance of the redox potential of the iodides is pointed out.

         <title>Recent Advances in Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Sulfinyl Compounds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in catalytic preparation of chiral sulfinyl compounds via transition&#8208;metal&#8208;, organo&#8208;, and biocatalysis are summarized. This review comprises applications in catalytic asymmetric synthesis of various types of enantiopure sulfinyl derivatives (including sulfoxides, sulfinate esters, sulfinamides, and sulfoximines) and is arranged according to the catalytic types.

Chiral sulfinyl architectures have emerged as one of most important structural motifs in modern drug and agrochemical discovery due to their unique physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. They are also recognized as versatile platforms for novel chiral ligands, organocatalysts, and auxiliaries in asymmetric synthesis. Benefitting from the development of transition metal catalysis, organocatalysis, and biocatalysis technologies in recent years, attention has exploited to new tactics for the asymmetric construction of chiral sulfinyl compounds and their derivatives. This review highlights the advances in the field of catalytic preparation of enantiopure sulfinyl derivatives (including sulfoxides, sulfinate esters, sulfinamides, and sulfoximines) since 2020, with an emphasis on the substrate scope, mechanistic aspect, unmet challenges, and future opportunities.

         <title>Green&#8208;Light Cerium Photocatalysis Enabled by Pyridine N&#8208;Oxide Ligands</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridine N&#8208;oxides are found to be hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer ligands in cerium photocatalysis. Compared to previous described systems, the corresponding photoactive cerium(IV)&#8208;complex exhibits a distinct bathochromic shift, which enables the CH&#8208;hydrazination of small molecules with green light.

Pyridine N&#8208;oxides are reported as neutral ligands in cerium photocatalysis. By using those neutral ligands, photoactive Ce(IV)&#8208;species are generated, which show an extensive bathochromic shift compared to previously employed cerium&#8208;based complexes. This allows the effective utilization of green light in the redox&#8208;neutral CH&#8208;hydrazination of small molecules under very mild photocatalytic conditions.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Base mediated 1,2&#8208;addition/oxa&#8208;Michael reaction sequence for the synthesis of sulfonylated isochromene is developed. The role of solvent is found to be crucial for the transformation. The method is extrapolated for the naphthalene and isocoumarine synthesis.

A base&#8208;promoted annulation via 1,2&#8208;addition/alkyne&#8208;allene isomerization/oxa&#8208;Michael cyclization of sulfonyl enynals for the synthesis of sulfonylated isochromene is developed. The choice of solvent plays a crucial role in this transformation to give the sulfonylated iscohromenes. The reaction mechanism is supported by the react&#8208;IR experiment. To emphasize the practical utility, the sulfonylated isochromene is deftly elaborated into diversely substituted naphthalene and isocoumarine.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Selective Desulfurization of Thioamides in Water and an Open System</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel protocol of selective desulfurization of thioamides to amines with dimethylaminoborane (DMAB) without catalysts, operating in neat water under an open system, is studied.

The selective reduction of the unsaturated substrates in green solvent is highly desired yet however, remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Especially the selective desulfurization of thioamides usually requires hazardous highly reactive reagents or transition metal catalysts in high&#8208;pressure conditions. Herein, a novel protocol of selective desulfurization of thioamides to amines with dimethylaminoborane (DMAB) without catalysts, operating in neat water under an open system, is presented. Notably, the selectivity of the reaction is effectively controlled with a simple Lewis acid additive through computational design. The combination of density functional theory and experimental mechanism studies reveals the important synergistic cooperation by DMAB and Lewis acid additive to facilitate the hydrogenative desulfurization process in an aqueous solution.

         <title>Synthesis of a Library of Bifunctional N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligand Precursors with Hydrogen Bond Donor Subunits</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward two&#8208;step synthesis to bifunctional precursors of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) is developed. Based on this, a library of imidazolium&#8208;based NHCs, with a variety of hydrogen bond donor groups in the backbone is prepared. The utility of the bifunctional NHC ligands is demonstrated in transition metal catalysis with the resulting palladium(II) and copper(I) complexes.

Bifunctional N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) with additional hydrogen bond donor groups in the backbone are important organocatalysts and ligands for transition metal complexes. Herein, a straightforward synthetic approach to a library of bifunctional imidazolium salts, precursors for the respective NHCs with amidine, squaramide, and (thio)urea moieties as hydrogen bond donors, is reported. The preparation of bifunctional palladium(II) and copper(I) NHC complexes and their application in catalysis is presented.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Induced Trifluoromethylation of (Hetero)Arenes by Using SF6 as an Oxidant</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light&#8208;driven trifluoromethylation protocol using SF6 as an oxidant has been developed. This method achieves regioselective C(sp2)&#8211;CF3 bond formation under mild conditions with Rose Bengal catalyst, blue LEDs and bench&#8208;stable CF3SO2Na. The reaction affords moderate to excellent yields across various (hetero)arenes, which facilitates the efficient utilization and degradation of the potent greenhouse gas SF6.

As a potent greenhouse gas, SF6 remains an underexplored oxidant despite its strong electronegativity. In this work, a visible light&#8208;driven trifluoromethylation protocol using SF6 as an oxidant has been developed. This method achieves regioselective C(sp2)&#8211;CF3 bond formation under mild conditions with Rose Bengal catalyst, blue LEDs and bench&#8208;stable CF3SO2Na, facilitating efficient utilization and degradation of the greenhouse gas SF6.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;Pyridone is a crucial building block in bioactive natural products and serves as a vital intermediate for the synthesis of bioactive nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. Recent advancements in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization have enabled the direct modification of 2&#8208;pyridones, circumventing the need for pre&#8208;functionalization. In this study, we report a Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed, C6&#8208;selective C&#8211;H heteroarylation of 2&#8208;pyridones using cyclic iodonium ylides as carbene precursors.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aryl&#8208;to&#8208;alkyl 1,4&#8208;palladium migration/Sonogashira coupling reaction has been developed. By extensive optimization of the reaction conditions, the regioselectivity was effectively modulated and allowed the synthesis of migratory alkynylation products in moderate to good yields.

This study presents the successful development of an aryl&#8208;to&#8208;alkyl 1,4&#8208;palladium migration/Sonogashira coupling reaction, enabling the synthesis of migratory alkynylation products in moderate to good yields. The regioselectivity is effectively modulated through extensive optimization of reaction conditions. Mechanistic investigations, supported by stoichiometric experiments with palladium complexes, provide insights into the catalytic cycle and the migratory pathway.

         <title>New Glycoconjugates Containing Selenium and Polyphenols. Stereoselective Synthesis by Pummerer&#8208;like Rearrangement.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two series of novel six&#8208;membered Se&#8208;glycoconjugates containing hydroxycinnamic acids marked by well&#8208;known antioxidant properties are synthesized, exploiting a Mitsunobu reaction and a Pummerer&#8208;like rearrangement. A first example of six&#8208;membered selenosugar with selenium in the ring and bearing an acetal&#8208;like functional group at C&#8208;1 was reported, which is a useful precursor of hydrolytically stable oligosaccharide and nucleoside mimics.

In the last 20&#8201;years the exploitation of antioxidant activity of selenobased compounds has improved, just due to the use of Ebselen, a selenocompound, as a Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) mimic. However, their clinical use seems to be compromised by the low solubility in water. To deal with this problem, it is possible to take advantage of the new approach including selenosugars in which selenium replaces heterocyclic oxygen. In this frame, to optimize the antioxidant properties of selenosugars, the glycoconjugation with a polyphenolic unit, which is a molecule capable of inhibiting or disabling the action of free radicals, has been considered in this work. The Mitsunobu reaction mechanism links covalently the primary alcoholic function of selenobased glycosyl donors, coming from the commercially available d&#8208;mannose, and phenolic moiety acceptors, to obtain the corresponding glycoconjugates, has been exploited affording the products in efficient yields. A density functional theory (DFT) theoretical study is carried out to help understand the possible influence of the seleno donor on the reactivity. Crucially, a new pathway based on Pummerer&#8208;like rearrangement followed by a glycosylation, gave a selenosugar with selenium in the ring and bearing an acetal&#8208;like functional group at C&#8208;1. All compounds are characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy confirming their structures and purity.

Attempting to address the growing synthetic complexity (SC) of conjugated polymers, the interdependent syntheses of the common acceptors 4,7&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (Br2BTD), 5,8&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihexylquinoxaline (Br2Qx), and 4,7&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2H&#8208;benzotriazole (Br2BTA) are all revisited. The SC Index is determined for both the traditional and optimized syntheses, showing improvements in the generation of all three acceptors.

In an attempt to address the growing problem of synthetic complexity in conjugated organic polymers, the synthesis of the common acceptor units 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (BTD), quinoxaline (Qx), and 2H&#8208;benzotriazole (BTA) have been revisited, along with their dibromo derivatives necessary for use in catalytic cross&#8208;coupling. In addition to reducing the total number of synthetic steps, efforts have been made to reduce hazardous reagents and simplify purification. Synthetic complexity index values for both established and newly reported methods are then generated in order to provide a qualitative evaluation of the reduced contribution of these common building blocks to the synthetic complexity of all materials that contain them.

         <title>Escape from Flatland: Pericyclic Reactions and Rearrangements of Diazofluorene with Biarylcyclooctynes for the Generation of Helicene&#8208;Like Phenanthro&#8208;Pyrazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the voyage of two flat, highly unsaturated systems into the third dimension. Specifically, we investigated the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of 9&#8208;diazofluorene with a rapidly growing class of strained dipolarophile&#8212;biarylcyclooctynes. We found that the initial spirocyclic 3H&#8208;pyrazole cycloadducts are isolable, and can be subjected to controllable [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic shifts. These van Alphen&#8211;H&#252;ttel rearrangements generate either the metastable 4H&#8208;pyrazoles&#8212;another spirocyclic fused&#8208;ring system with a highly contorted structure&#8212;or the thermodynamically favored 1H&#8208;pyrazoles. The 1H&#8208;pyrazoles display extended conjugation and can be classified as [5]&#8208;helicenes containing a phenanthro&#8208;pyrazole fused to a dihydro&#8208;cyclooctatetraene. Overall, these studies provide a modular framework to control heteroatom placement, ring size, and ring fusion in the syntheses of carbon&#8208;rich materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Anion&#8208;Binding&#8208;Catalyzed Nucleophilic Addition to 4&#8208;Quinolones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first organocatalytic enantioselective formal 1,4&#8208;addition to 4&#8208;quinolones has been developed. This method relies on chiral triazole&#8208;based anion&#8208;binding catalysis using enol nucleophiles, complementing previous metal catalytic approaches. Moderate to good yields and enantioselectivities were achieved by in&#8201;situ silylation and formation of a key quinolinium&#8208;catalyst chiral contact ion pair, allowing for chirality transfer to the product upon nucleophilic attack.

Chiral quinolones and their derivatives are predominant synthetic building blocks and pharmacological agents. Nevertheless, their synthesis mostly relies on transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective 1,4&#8208;additions of organometallic reagents such as Grignard, organozinc, or organoboron species for alkylation, arylation, and alkynylation reactions. Herein, the first organocatalytic enantioselective formal 1,4&#8208;addition to challenging 4&#8208;quinolones is reported, upon in&#8201;situ silylation to the corresponding quinolinium ions, followed by asymmetric nucleophilic attack to this type of substrates. This method complements previous metal&#8208;catalyzed approaches by enrolling enol nucleophiles and relies on anion&#8208;binding catalysis using a chiral triazole&#8208;based anion binder. The enantioenriched 2&#8208;substituted 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4&#8208;quinolones were thus obtained in good yields (up to 97% yield) and enantioselectivities up to 89:11 e.r. Finally, the easy access to 4&#8208;amino and &#947;&#8211;amino alcohol derivatives by post&#8208;functionalization, as well as to enantiopure compounds (&gt;99:1 e.r.), was showcased. The notable features of this protocol include its mild reaction conditions, avoiding the use of transition metals, broad functional group tolerance, and potential application toward the synthesis of chiral 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4&#8208;quinolones and tetrahydroquinolines as important skeletons of bioactive and natural products.

         <dc:description>In the last decade, substances possessing the dihydroindeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene scaffold showed interesting photo&#8208;physical properties and other potential applications in electronics. The afore&#8208;mentioned compounds belong to the family of five regioisomeric dihydroindenofluorenes, but unlike other ones, they possess angular or, in the case of higher congeners, helical shape. This review is mainly focused on various synthetic approaches to compounds possessing the dihydroindeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene scaffold and their conversions to other polyaromatic hydrocarbons. In addition, their physico&#8208;chemical and photophysical properties, and current and/or potential applications are briefly described as well.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical arylation reactions mediated by a terpyridine cobalt complex</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The complex [CoII(4'&#8209;MeO&#8209;tpy)2](PF6)2 (4'&#8209;MeO&#8209;tpy = 4'&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2,2':6',2''&#8208;terpyridine) effectively mediates visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven arylation of pyrroles, 1,3,5&#8209;trimethoxybenzene and bis(pinacolato)diborane (B2Pin2). Mechanistic studies suggest the reaction likely proceeds via a halogen atom transfer mechanism facilitated by an &#945;&#8209;aminyl radical. This work highlights the potential of optimizing the ligand framework and reaction conditions to advance the application of earth&#8208;abundant transition metal complexes in photoredox catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>SnCl2&#8208;Catalyzed Phosphorylation of Alcohols and Selective Phosphorylation/Phosphinoylation of Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, stannous chloride catalyzed phosphorylation of alcohols and selective phosphorylation of carbohydrates are explored, giving a new approach to obtain biologically active phosphorylated molecules.

Phosphorylated molecules, particularly phosphorylated carbohydrates, have garnered significant interest due to their distinct biological activities, driving an urgent demand for efficient phosphorylation strategies. Herein, the successful development of a SnCl2&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the phosphorylation of alcohols and carbohydrates is demonstrated. Notably, the reaction efficiency is found to be critically dependent on the addition order of SnCl2 and N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine, a phenomenon systematically investigated through mechanistic studies. A one&#8208;pot sequential ketalization/phosphorylation strategy is established for polyol substrates, enabling streamlined access to phosphorylated derivatives. The versatility of this approach is further exemplified by achieving selective phosphorylation/phosphinoylation of carbohydrates.

         <title>Chemoselective Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated Silyl Esters and Silyl Phosphonates Over Cyclopropanation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated silyl esters are an important class of compounds in organic, inorganic and pharmaceutical chemistry, known for their versatility and unique reactivity. The conjugated system in these compounds enables for Michael addition reactions, making them useful intermediates in the synthesis of complex organic/inorganic molecules, including pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and natural products. Having realized the importance of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated silyl esters, we have devised a strategy to synthesize various functionalized allyl and vinyl silanes using diazo compounds and respective silanes. Herein we have demonstrated that the allyl and vinyl silanes can react with diazo compounds in a chemoselective manner offering a versatile method for constructing C&#8208;C bond formation over the cyclopropanation reaction in the presence of 1 mol% of [Cp*RuCl2]n as a catalyst under mild conditions. Direct C&#8208;H bond functionalization of allyl and vinyl silanes with alpha diazo esters and phosphonate diazo showcasing the adaptability of silicon&#8208;based chemistry in modern organic synthesis. The plausible mechanism of the reaction has been realized with the help of DFT calculations. All the synthesized &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated siliyl esters were isolated and characterized by using sophisticated analytical and spectroscopic techniques.</dc:description>

Density functional computations (PW6B95D3/6311+G(d,p)&#8208;PCM(toluene)//B97D3/6&#8208;31G*) explain the formation of the dithiaphosphole product from alkynes and Lawesson's reagent via a sequence of [2+2] addition, electrocyclic ring opening, S&#8208;S&#8208;bond forming ring&#8208;closure and P(III)&#8208;oxidation by sulfur transfer from Lawesson's reagent. Based on DFT calculations the formation of a 1,3,2,4&#8208;dithiadiphosphinane&#8208;2,4&#8208;disulfide is rationalized by a sequence of cyclization, electrocyclic ring opening and dipolar cyclization steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Ectocarpin A</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully enantioselective total synthesis of ectocarpin A, a new oxylipin, has been achieved in 12 steps starting from tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;cyclopentafuranone. Key steps include the formation of the chiral core, diastereoselective epoxidation, enzymatic desymmetrization of a 1,4&#8208;diol, epimerization, and strategic Wittig and Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefinations to construct the carbon framework.

A total enantioselective synthesis of ectocarpin A, an oxylipin identified through the first hydroperoxide bicyclase activity of CYP5164A3 in brown algae, has been successfully completed in 12 steps starting from tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;cyclopentafuranone. Key transformations include the creation of the chiral tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;cyclopentafuranone, a diastereoselective epoxidation, an enzymatic desymmetrization of a 1,4&#8208;diol, an epimerization, and both Wittig and Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefinations to build the carbon framework of ectocarpin A.

         <title>2&#8208;Formyl&#8208;5&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)furan (HMF) Derivatives as Active Complexing Agent for CO2 Insertion Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Renewable&#8208;based furanics derived from 5&#8208;HMF are used to synthesize cyclic organic carbonates (COCs) via CO2 insertion into epoxides. The BHTHF/NaBr complexing system shows high activity, achieving 94&#8211;99% epoxide conversion and 70&#8211;99% COC selectivity under mild conditions. The system maintains catalytic efficiency over nine consecutive cycles without performance loss.

Renewable&#8208;based furan compounds derived from 2&#8208;formyl&#8208;5&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)furan (5&#8208;HMF) are successfully employed as catalysts to synthesize cyclic organic carbonates through the reaction of carbon dioxide with epoxides. The effects of temperature, reaction time, reagent ratios, and carbon dioxide pressure are optimized before evaluating various bio&#8208;based complexing agents in combination with different alkali metal halide salts. Among them, 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran (BHTHF) shows the highest efficiency as a complexing agent when paired with sodium bromide (NaBr), enabling the production of industrially relevant cyclic carbonates in high yields (12 examples, achieving 94&#8211;99% epoxide conversion and 70&#8211;99% carbonate selectivity) under mild pressure conditions (carbon dioxide pressure of 1&#8211;10&#8201;bar, reaction time of 6&#8201;h, and temperature of 120&#8201;&#176;C). Additionally, the BHTHF/NaBr catalytic system demonstrates high stability, maintaining its performance over nine consecutive epoxide additions (8&#8201;mmol each) without any loss of efficiency.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Cyclization of Cyclohexadienone&#8208;Tethered Ynals to Stereodivergent 6,5&#8208;Bicyclic and 6,5,5&#8208;Tricyclic Products</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyst enables the transformation of prochiral cyclohexadienone&#8208;tethered ynals into stereodivergent 6,5&#8208;bicyclic and 6,5,5&#8208;tricyclic products. A proposed kinetic resolution process probably enhances the enantioselectivity in the formation of bicyclic products.

Transforming a prochiral substrate into two stereodivergent products using a single chiral catalyst remains a significant challenge. Herein, an NHC&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyclization of cyclohexadienone&#8208;tethered ynals, enabling the preparation of two stereodivergent products: 6,5&#8208;bicyclic and 6,5,5&#8208;tricyclic frameworks, is reported. The reaction proceeds through two distinct pathways: an allenolate&#8208;Michael addition/esterification sequence and an allenolate&#8208;Michael addition/intramolecular Dieckmann condensation process. This approach represents a novel and efficient strategy for transforming a prochiral substrate into two products in a stereodivergent manner.

         <title>Diazo Compounds Under Visible Light: Stereoselective Synthesis of Cyclic Architectures</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of diazo compounds under photochemical conditions find high selectivity. In the presence of light, diazo substrates can act as carbene precursors or radical sources depending upon the reaction conditions and catalysts used. This review focuses on recent advances (2020&#8211;2024) in stereoselective synthesis of various cyclic scaffolds via visible&#8208;light irradiation of diazo compounds.

Diazo compounds are versatile and valuable reagents in organic synthesis. The reaction of diazo substrates under photochemical conditions find high selectivity compared to that under thermal conditions. In the presence of light, they can act as carbene precursors or radical sources depending upon the reaction conditions and catalysts used. Recent years have witnessed a great advancement in visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photochemistry of diazo compounds for asymmetric access to various cyclic compounds. In this review, recent advances (2020&#8211;2024) in stereoselective synthesis of cyclic scaffolds via visible&#8208;light irradiation of diazo compounds are summarized. This review is organized according to the ring size of the synthesized compounds, viz., three, four, five, six, seven, and higher&#8208; membered ring systems. With an emphasis of mechanistic insights and scope of the reactions, this review shades light on current trends in this emerging field.

A facile and efficient protocol to synthesize C2&#8208;phosphorylated 2,3&#8208;2H&#8208;chromones is discovered via Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;promoted tandem addition/cyclization of enaminones with H&#8208;phosphine oxides. Various C2&#8208;phosphorylated products 3 and 4 are smoothly constructed in excellent yields, providing a novel strategy for C2&#8208;phosphorylated 2,3&#8208;2H&#8208;chromones.

A facile and efficient protocol to synthesize C2&#8208;phosphorylated 2,3&#8208;2H&#8208;chromones is discovered via Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;promoted tandem addition/cyclization of enaminones with H&#8208;phosphine oxides. The reaction exhibits a broad scope, good functional group tolerance, and good yields, and features ability of a gram&#8208;scaled synthesis. Results of mechanistic study reveal that the reaction initially undergoes intramolecular cyclization to form chromone 5, which can subsequently be reacted with 2a to yield C2&#8208;phosphorylated 2,3&#8208;2H&#8208;chromones through intermolecular addition.

         <title>Unlocking Indazole Synthesis from &#945;&#8208;Diazo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Ketoesters via Aryne Trapping: A Streamlined Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the growing demand to develop, beyond laboratory scale, more efficient, safer and ecofriendly, as well as scalable mechanochemical transformations, the direct synthesis of 1&#8208;acyl&#8208;1H&#8208;indazoles via &#945;&#8208;diazo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters aryne trapping is reported. The results reveal the unexpected formation of N&#8208;aryl&#8208;1H&#8208;indazoles and aryl benzoates, likely facilitated by a thia&#8208;fries rearrangement. Density functional theory calculations elucidate the cycloaddition pathway and rationalize the formation of the various reaction products.

Indazoles are high&#8208;value chemical building blocks used in medicinal chemistry and materials science for their distinct structural and functional features. This study details a [3&#8201;+&#8201;2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction between various aryl&#8208;ketodiazoesters and ortho&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)aryl triflates under mild conditions, leading predominantly to 1&#8208;acyl&#8208;1H&#8208;indazoles. N&#8208;aryl&#8208;1H&#8208;indazoles and aryl benzoates are also observed as other products. The reaction exhibits broad functional group tolerance and scalability, making it a valuable synthetic approach. Mechanistic insights, derived from control experiments and density functional theory calculations, elucidate the cycloaddition pathway and rationalize the formation of the products. Collectively, these findings underscore the method's potential for synthesizing complex indazole derivatives, which hold significant promises for applications in pharmaceutical development and advanced materials research.

         <title>Harnessing Electricity in Dehydrogenative Coupling: Transition Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of Quinoline Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Providing easy access to quinoline derivatives under room temperature, transition metal&#8208;free, and oxidant&#8208;free conditions using electricity as an oxidant through a dehydrogenative pathway. A wide range of functional groups are tolerated, giving the desired quinoline product in good yields.

An efficient strategy is demonstrated for the electrocatalytic synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl quinoline derivatives via an anodic dehydrogenation of 2&#8208;aminobenzyl alcohol molecules followed by condensation with carbonyl compounds at room temperature. The current protocol requires only electricity as the green oxidant, provides the desired products in good to excellent yield, and is compatible with a wide range of functional groups.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes are valuable synthetic intermediates in organofluorine chemistry; however, their reactivity often involves intermediates prone to fluorine elimination, leading to monofluorinated products. Here, we present a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed dioxygenation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes with alcohols, which retains both fluorine atoms and yields &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers. This method is operationally simple, employs inexpensive and standard reagents, and demonstrates broad functional group tolerance. The reaction is scalable, enabling the use of the gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropane motif as a masked precursor for &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated&#8208;1,3&#8208;diethers in synthetic sequences. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest a radical&#8208;mediated process involving concerted SN2&#8208;like ring&#8208;opening functionalization.</dc:description>
