         <title>Strengths of Acids in Acetonitrile</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The equilibrium acidity scale (pKa  scale) in acetonitrile has been supplemented by numerous new compounds and new &#916;pKa  measurements. It now contains altogether 231 acids &#8211; over twice more than published previously &#8211; linked by 566 &#916;pKa  measurements and spans between the pKa  values of hydrogen iodide (2.8) and indole (32.57), covering close to 30 orders of magnitude. Measurement results acquired over the last 15 years were added to the scale and new least squares treatment was carried out. The treatment yielded revised pKa  values for the compounds published previously, with the root mean square difference between revised and previous values 0.04, demonstrating very good stability of the scale.
Correlation equations were developed for estimating pKa  values for the studied types of compounds in water, DMSO, DMF and 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane on the basis of pKa  values in acetonitrile. These equations enable predicting pKa  values with an average error around or less than 1 pKa  unit, which is a sufficient accuracy for many applications.
The scale is expected to be a useful tool for the widest possible research areas in organic chemistry, electrochemical power sources, catalysis, etc.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Syntheses of Amorfrutin C and C&#8208;5 Substituted Amorfrutin Analogues</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amorfrutin C, a  C  &#8208;5 prenyl amorfrutin, its allyl analog and an amorfrutin  C  &#8208;5 aldehyde have been synthesized using a biomimetic strategy from non&#8208;aromatic precursors. In this approach, a dioxinone derived  &#946;,&#948;&#8208;  diketo ester underwent a decarboxylative Pd(0) catalyzed prenyl migration to give a  &#946;,&#948;&#8208;  diketo dioxinone, which readily aromatized giving the amorfrutin core. The introduction of prenyl and allyl moieties at the  C  &#8208;5 position of the scaffold were accomplished using a Claisen rearrangement. Alternatively, iodination, lithium&#8208;iodine exchange and trapping with DMF gave the amorfrutin aldehyde and an amorfrutin alcohol when excess  n  &#8208;BuLi was used.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Reaction of N,N&#8208;Dimethylanilines with N&#8208;Substituted Maleimides Utilizing Benzaldehyde as the Photoinitiator</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzaldehyde can be employed as the photoinitiator for the introduction of a low&#8208;cost, simple, photochemical protocol for the reaction between N&#8208;substituted maleimides with N,N&#8208;dialkylanilines.







Abstract
Photoorganocatalysis constitutes a powerful domain of photochemistry and organic synthesis. The scaffold of pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]quinolinoles exhibits interesting and potent inhibition against various enzymes, making them really promising pharmaceutical targets. Herein, we describe a photochemical methodology for the reaction of N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines with N&#8208;substituted maleimides, utilizing benzaldehyde as the photoinitiator. A variety of substituted N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines and N&#8208;substituted maleimides were converted into the corresponding adducts in moderate to high yields.

         <title>Phosphoric Acid Mediated Light&#8208;Induced Minisci C&#8722;H Alkylation of N&#8208;Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light&#8208;intduced/phosphate&#8208;mediated light&#8208;induced Minisci&#8208;type reaction under metal&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free condition was developed, which provided an efficient and environmentally friendly way to access functionalized N&#8208;heteroarenes. The transformation underwent a radical pathway, and the diphenyl phosphate played a key role in the catalytic cycle via hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
Herein, we report an environmentally&#8208;friendly light&#8208;induced Minisci alkylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes with a broad substrate scope using diphenyl phosphate as catalyst under metal&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions. The radical precursor redox&#8208;active esters (RAEs) were introduced as alkylating reagents for the functionalization of N&#8208;heteroarene derivatives including pyridine, quinoline, and isoquinoline. Mechanistic studies suggested that diphenyl phosphate played a key role via hydrogen bonding in the catalytic cycle.

         <title>C&#8722;H Activation and Cross&#8208;Coupling of Acyclic Aldonitrone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H activation of an acyclic, glyoxalate&#8208;derived aldonitrone and its cross&#8208;coupling with a variety of aryl and heteroaryl bromides provides C&#8208;aryl ketonitrones with very high E selectivity.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed activation of C(sp2)&#8722;H bond in a readily E,Z&#8208;isomerizable aldonitrone, bearing an ester group at the C terminus, enabled its cross&#8208;coupling with a variety of aryl and heteroaryl bromides to give ketonitrones, including products with functional groups not compatible with the classical nitrone synthesis via condensation with hydroxylamines. The reactions proceeded with very high (usually complete) E selectivity. The key to obtaining good yields of the cross&#8208;coupling products was the use of sterically hindered carboxylic acid as additive and non&#8208;polar solvent (toluene), in which the starting nitrone exists mainly as E isomer.

&lt;p&gt;Palladium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H activation of an acyclic, glyoxalate&#8208;derived aldonitrone and its cross&#8208;coupling with a variety of aryl and heteroaryl bromides provides &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;aryl ketonitrones with very high &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; selectivity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palladium&#8208;catalyzed activation of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bond in a readily &lt;i&gt;E,Z&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;isomerizable aldonitrone, bearing an ester group at the C terminus, enabled its cross&#8208;coupling with a variety of aryl and heteroaryl bromides to give ketonitrones, including products with functional groups not compatible with the classical nitrone synthesis via condensation with hydroxylamines. The reactions proceeded with very high (usually complete) &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; selectivity. The key to obtaining good yields of the cross&#8208;coupling products was the use of sterically hindered carboxylic acid as additive and non&#8208;polar solvent (toluene), in which the starting nitrone exists mainly as &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; isomer. Further use of the obtained ketonitrones in dipolar cycloaddition or nucleophilic addition has also been demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis of Natural Compounds Based on the [3,7]&#8208;Diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (Bispidine) Core</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [3,7]&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (bispidine) structure is found in several interesting naturally occurring alkaloids as the tetracyclic alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;sparteine and the tricyclic (&#8722;)&#8208;cytisine alkaloids. In this review, we describe the most relevant strategies for the synthesis of molecules.







Abstract
The [3,7]&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (bispidine) structure is found in several interesting naturally occurring alkaloids. The most representative components are the tetracyclic alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;sparteine and the tricyclic (&#8722;)&#8208;cytisine alkaloids. Their biological activities have been known for a long time. In the literature, different syntheses of both tetracyclic and tricyclic structures have been reported, especially in the last few years, when a number of new reports renewed the interest in these fascinating molecules. Bicyclic bispidine derivatives have been thoroughly investigated in recent times also for their applications as catalysts, metal chelating agents, and lately in coordination polymers chemistry. In this review, we describe the most relevant strategies for the synthesis of molecules based on the [3,7]&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core, related to (&#8722;)&#8208;sparteine and (&#8722;)&#8208;cytisine alkaloids.

         <title>Controlling &#947;&#8208;Peptide Helicity with Stereoselective Fluorination</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Do the twist: C&#8722;F bonds have been incorporated, with stereocontrol, onto the backbone of a &#947;&#8208;hexapeptide. The presence of fluorine either stabilizes or disrupts the helical conformation, depending on the stereochemical configuration. Fluorine also sets the &#8220;handedness&#8221; of the helix.







Abstract
Peptides that are composed of backbone&#8208;extended amino acids can adopt conformations resembling natural &#945;&#8208;peptidic motifs, making them promising scaffolds for biological and medicinal chemistry. In order to unlock the full potential of this class of molecules, the ability to control their secondary structures is essential. Here we show that stereoselective fluorination can be harnessed as a tool for influencing the helical character of a &#947;&#8208;hexapeptide. Fluorination is shown to either stabilize or disrupt the 9&#8208;helical conformation depending on the C&#8722;F stereochemistry, and fluorination also sets the handedness of the helix. These results provide fundamental knowledge that could expedite the future development of backbone&#8208;extended peptides for medicinal applications.

The reported tris&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids substituted on the 1,3,5&#8208;positions of an aromatic ring are not suitable for mimicking trimers due to their low flexibility and high planarity.

         <dc:description>Glycosamines are important buildings blocks of natural biopolymers. The development of synthetic routes to such glycoside family is of big interest in terms of biological application. Herein, an access to glycosamine derivatives through dual nickel/copper catalyzed C&#8208;N bond formation via a cross&#8208;coupling reaction is presented. Diverse benzyl&#8208; and cyclic amide&#8208;containing glycals were successfully synthesized in moderate to excellent yields starting from perbenzylated and protecting group&#8208;free 2&#8208;iodoglycals. 16 examples presenting  d  &#8208;glucal or  d  &#8208;galactal configuration and an electron&#8208;rich or electron&#8208;poor amide moiety in position 2 of the carbohydrate are obtained by this methodology. Post&#8208;functionalization by hydrogenolysis conditions of three synthesized compounds allows access to  d  &#8208;mannosamine and  d  &#8208;talosamine mimics.</dc:description>

Arynes are utilized in the syntheses of 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines, epoxides, and phenolic ethers involving Diels&#8208;Alder, Johnson&#8208;Corey&#8208;Chaykovsky, and Claisen&#8208;type rearrangement reactions, respectively, through three different domino processes







Abstract
Synthetic application of arynes is broadened by their reactions with neutral N&#8208;, S&#8208;, and O&#8208;containing nucleophiles to produce three types of compounds. Accordingly, 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines are synthesized from Schiff bases, alkynes, and arynes through a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. Epoxides are prepared from thioethers and arynes along with aldehydes or ketones through a Johnson&#8208;Corey&#8208;Chaykovsky reaction. Phenolic ethers are produced from allyl ethers and arynes through a Claisen&#8208;type rearrangement. These target molecules, including natural products &#947;&#8208;asarone, asaricin, and a cholesteryl phenolic ether, are formed through reactions initiated by arynes. These new reactions share a prevailing feature of domino processes, which are carried out in a single flask and afford the desired products in good to high yields.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Mediated Coupling of Cyclic Amines with Sulfonyl Hydrazides: an Efficient Synthesis of Vinyl Sulfone Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 4, Page 701-708, January 26, 2021. </description>

A highly efficient and generally applicable methodology for the construction of vinyl sulfone derivatives from cyclic amines and sulfonyl hydrazides in one step was developed. This protocol could be applied for the C&#8722;S bond formation of N&#8208;Aryl piperidines, N&#8208;alkyl piperidines, and heteroaryl piperidines with sulfonyl hydrazides.







Abstract
An efficient iodine&#8208;mediated coupling of cyclic amines with sulfonyl hydrazides is reported. This transformation opens a new route to the synthesis of vinyl sulfones derivatives, which is a common structural motif in natural products and pharmaceuticals. Tentative mechanistic studies suggest that this reaction is likely to involve a radical process.

         <title>Allosteric Guest Binding in Chiral Zirconium(IV) Double Decker Porphyrin Cages</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 4, Page 607-617, January 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from achiral porphyrin cage compounds, chiral zirconium(IV) double decker porphyrin cages have been prepared and their enantiomers resolved. The binding of two viologen guests in the double decker porphyrin cages occurs via a strongly negative allosteric effect, resulting in an almost 3 orders of magnitude weaker binding of the second viologen guest compared to that of the first.







Abstract
Chiral zirconium(IV) double cage sandwich complex Zr(1)2 has been synthesized in one step from porphyrin cage H21. Zr(1)2 was obtained as a racemate, which was resolved by HPLC and the enantiomers were isolated in &gt;99.5&#8201;% ee. Their absolute configurations were assigned on the basis of X&#8208;ray crystallography and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) experiments on the enantiomers of Zr(1)2 revealed that the chirality around the zirconium center is propagated throughout the whole cage structure. The axial conformational chirality of the double cage complex displayed a VCD fingerprint similar to the one observed previously for a related chiral cage compound with planar and point chirality. Zr(1)2 shows fluorescence, which is quenched when viologen guests bind in its cavities. The binding of viologen and dihydroxybenzene derivatives in the two cavities of Zr(1)2 occurs with negative allostery, the cooperativity factors &#945; (=4&#8197;K2/K1) being as low as 0.0076 for the binding of N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylviologen. These allosteric effects are attributed to a pinching of the second cavity as a result of guest binding in the first cavity.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Efficient Synthesis of Amides from Alcohols using Cu&#8722;N&#8722;TiO2 Heterogeneous Photocatalyst</title>

         <dc:description>
A simple and practical method for direct amide synthesis from alcohols and amines using an in&#8197;situ generated active ester of N&#8208;hydroxyimide with the earlier developed robust and recyclable Cu&#8722;N&#8722;TiO2 catalyst, at room temperature, using oxygen as a sole oxidant under visible light is discussed. The application of this amidation reaction has been successfully demonstrated for the synthesis of moclobemide, an antidepressant drug, and an analog of the itopride drug on a gram scale.







Abstract
Amides were synthesized from alcohols and amines in high yields using an in&#8197;situ generated active ester of N&#8208;hydroxyimide with our developed Cu&#8722;N&#8722;TiO2 catalyst at room temperature using oxygen as a sole oxidant under visible light. The catalyst can be easily prepared, robust, and recycled four times without a considerable change in catalytic activity. This developed protocol applies to a wide substrate scope and has good functional group tolerance. The application of this amidation reaction has been successfully demonstrated for the synthesis of moclobemide, an antidepressant drug, and an analog of the itopride drug on a gram scale.

         <title>Computational and Experimental Insights into Asymmetric Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrocarboxylation with CO2</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 4, Page 663-670, January 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational and experimental methods were employed to study the potential of different bidentate ligands in the enantioselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydrocarboxylation of acrylates. Our computational analysis shows that during C&#8722;C bond formation, CO2 prefers an outer sphere insertion mode. The ligands StackPhos and tBu&#8208;BOX show good yields and display an intriguing stacking interaction between the internal N&#8208;heterocycle and CO2.







Abstract
The asymmetric Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydrocarboxylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds was originally developed by Mikami and co&#8208;workers but gives only moderate enantiomeric excesses. In order to understand the factors controlling the enantioselectivity and to propose novel ligands for this reaction, we have used computational and experimental methods to study the Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydrocarboxylation with different bidentate ligands. The analysis of the C&#8722;CO2 bond formation transition states with DFT methods shows a preference for outer&#8208;sphere CO2 insertion, where CO2 can undergo a backside or frontside reaction with the nucleophile. The two ligands that prefer a frontside reaction, StackPhos and tBu&#8208;BOX, display an intriguing stacking interaction between CO2 and an N&#8208;heterocyclic ring of the ligand (imidazole or oxazoline). Our experimental results support the computationally predicted low enantiomeric excesses and highlight the difficulty in developing a highly selective version of this reaction.

New regioregular electropolymers have been obtained from donor&#8208;acceptor spiro&#8208;configured monomers with a 4,4&#8242;&#8208;spirobi[cyclopenta[2,1&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;3,4&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene] core. The effects of the substitution arrangement of the monomers on their electrooptic properties as well as on their electropolymerization capacity and the electrooptic and morphological characteristics of the polymeric films obtained have been highlighted.







Abstract
A series of conjugation extended push&#8208;pull derivatives of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;spirobi[cyclopenta[2,1&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;3,4&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene] were synthesized and fully characterized, in which each perpendicularly aligned cyclopenta[2,1&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;3,4&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene features a pendant dicyanovinylene as an electron acceptor and a thiophene as an electron donor. The electrochemical and photophysical properties of the new molecules, which differ from each other for the presence and/or location of an additional n&#8208;hexyl chain on the pendant thiophene unit, were investigated, as well as their susceptibility to electrochemical polymerization. The substitution arrangement of the monomers was found to exert significant influence on the outcome of the electropolymerization process and on the optoelectronic properties and morphological film characteristics of the new regioregular materials obtained.

The newly synthesized 1,4&#8208;disubstituted &#945;&#8208;diazo glutaconimides are converted into polysubstituted pyridines and oxazolo[5,4&#8208;b]pyridine via the reactions of Rh(II)&#8208;catalyzed XH&#8208;insertion and [3+2] cycloaddition to nitriles, respectively.







Abstract
A convenient general approach towards 1,4&#8208;disubstituted &#945;&#8208;diazo glutaconimides starting from &#946;&#8208;substituted glutaconic acid anhydrides has been developed. It involves condensation with amines and subsequent diazo transfer reaction. This new class of diazocarbonyl heterocycles has been converted into a series of polysubstituted pyridine&#8208;2,6(1H,3H)&#8208;diones and oxazolo[5,4&#8208;b]pyridin&#8208;5(4H)&#8208;ones via a Rh2(esp)2&#8208;catalyzed XH&#8208;insertion reaction and [3+2] cycloaddition with nitriles, respectively.

         <title>Synthesis of Quinoline&#8208;4&#8208;carboxamides and Quinoline&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylates via a Modified Pfitzinger Reaction of N&#8208;Vinylisatins</title>

Quinoline&#8208;4&#8208;carboxamides and 4&#8208;carboxylates are a class of heteroaromatic compounds present in a large family of laboratory&#8208;made molecules, with a wide range of important biological activities. Herein, a synthetic approach to its accelerated assembly is described, using a rearrangement of N&#8208;vinylisatins, promoted by different types of amines (or ethanol) in a Pfitzinger&#8208;like mechanism that, in turn, builds the quinoline ring system.







Abstract
A synthetic approach for the accelerated assembly of quinoline&#8208;4&#8208;carboxamide and quinoline&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate nuclei is presented. The methodology is based on the rearrangement of N&#8208;vinylisatins promoted by different types of amines (or ethanol) in a Pfitzinger&#8208;type mechanism that, in turn, builds the quinoline ring system. The reaction took place only by heating the starting materials in ethanol, without any additive.

         <title>Front Cover: Allosteric Guest Binding in Chiral Zirconium(IV) Double Decker Porphyrin Cages (Eur. J. Org. Chem. 4/2021)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 4, Page 512-512, January 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows a chiral double decker porphyrin cage, which has been resolved into enantiomers (red and blue structures). The compound was characterized by various physical techniques, including X&#8208;ray and circular dichroism (spectra in the center). The porphyrin cage compound forms well&#8208;defined self&#8208;assembled monolayers on HOPG surfaces, which are visible by scanning tunneling microscopy (background). The binding of a guest (viologen) in one of the cages of the compound leads to a contraction of the other cage (indicated by the white wiggles), resulting in a greatly reduced guest binding in the latter cage (negative allosteric effect). More information can be found in the Full Paper by Roeland J.M. Nolte et&#8197;al.

The Cover Feature shows the remarkable progress of the venerable MSR reaction during the last decade. Like superb fireworks, sparkling results were obtained in many directions as presented in this review article. It includes the discovery of novel and very efficient catalysts, or multicatalytic systems, and the use of MSR for innovative cascade processes to prepare many carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. Moreover, elegant applications of MSR have been reported for the preparation of complex natural products. Finally, the first examples of the aza&#8208;variant of MSR were published also in the recent years. More information can be found in the Review by Ren&#233; Gr&#233;e et&#8197;al.

A century after its discovery, the Meyer&#8208;Schuster rearrangement appears as a very useful method to prepare &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl derivatives. This comprehensive review highlights the progress of this reaction during the last decade focusing on the new catalysts, the novel cascade reactions, the brilliant applications in total synthesis of natural products, and the first examples of aza&#8208;Meyer&#8208;Schuster rearrangement.







Abstract
The Meyer&#8208;Schuster rearrangement is an efficient method to prepare &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsatured carbonyl compounds starting from propargylic alcohols and this review presents the remarkable progress made during the last decade in this reaction. New efficient catalytic systems have been discovered and many elegant applications have been reported for this rearrangement. To be noticed in particular are the new and efficient cascade processes affording a wide range of carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic molecules. Moreover, brilliant applications of this rearrangement have been described as well, in the total synthesis of complex natural products and their analogues. Finally, the first examples of aza&#8208;Meyer&#8208;Schuster rearrangements have been recently described as well.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 4, Page 543-586, January 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The World is &#8220;based&#8221; on some principle components. One type of such &#8220;bases&#8221; is the symmetrical tertiary amines. Applications of such amines and different approaches to their synthesis are described in this review.






Tertiary amines represent a key class of organic molecules with multiple industrial, synthetic, and analytical applications. The focus of this review is on different approaches towards the synthesis of the C3 and C3V symmetrical tertiary amines. Generally, symmetrical tertiary amines can be prepared via N&#8208;alkylation with alkyl halides and alcohols, reductive amination, desamination, hydroamination of olefins, and different kinds of C&#8211;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions. All reactions leading to the titled structures are discussed, and the advantages and disadvantages of each method are provided.

This review summarizes the comprehensive progress in the preparations and synthetic applications of Si&#8208;containing three membered rings, such as silirane, sila&#8208;aza/&#8208;phospha/&#8208;oxa/&#8208;thia cyclopropanes, which are usually very reactive due to the high strain, that causes difficulties in its synthesis, but are very useful as precursors or intermediates for various stereselective and non&#8208;stereoselective organic transformations.

The Si&#8208;containing three membered ring systems lack stability, due to the high strain, hence need tremendous efforts for its preparation. However, the enhanced energy makes these rings very useful precursors or intermediates for various stereoselective/non&#8208;stereoselective organic transformations via cleavage of ring in the presence of several nucleophiles/electrophiles.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Acyl Nitrene Transfer Reactions Involving Dioxazolones: Direct Assembly of N&#8208;Acylureas</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 4, Page 648-652, January 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of N&#8208;acylurea derivatives through the silver&#8208;catalyzed coupling of readily available dioxazolones with isocyanides and water has been reported. The desired products were obtained in moderate to good yields. The reaction can be performed on gram scale. The 18O&#8208;labelling experiment shows that water participates in this reaction. A possible reaction mechanism is proposed in which carbodiimide is postulated as the key intermediate.







Abstract
Dioxazolones and isocyanides are useful synthetic building blocks, and have attracted significant attention from researchers. However, the silver&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer reaction of dioxazolones has not been investigated to date. Herein, a silver&#8208;catalyzed acyl nitrene transfer reaction involving dioxazolones, isocyanides, and water was realized in the presence of Ag2O to afford a series of N&#8208;acylureas in moderate to good yields.

Herein, we have successfully developed an efficient protocol for the construction of benzothio(seleno)phenes and indoles through an Ag&#8208;mediated cyclization/demethylation process. Various 2&#8208;substituted benzothio(seleno)phenes and indoles were obtained in good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions with low catalyst loading. A conceivable reaction mechanism was proposed and supported by an isotope&#8208;exchange experiment.







Abstract
An Ag&#8208;catalyzed cyclization/demethylation of 2&#8208;alkynylthio(seleno)anisoles and 2&#8208;alkynyldimethylanilines is described and applied for the construction of valuable benzothio(seleno)phenes as well as indoles. Various 2&#8208;substituted benzothio(seleno)phenes and indoles were obtained in good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions with low catalyst loading. An application of this new method is also exemplified with a concise synthesis of a bioactive molecule precursor. Furthermore, a conceivable reaction mechanism is proposed with supports from isotope&#8208;exchange experiments.

A thiocarbamate&#8208;directed Cp*Co(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H amidation of olefins to synthesize (Z)&#8208;selective enamines was explored. The mild reaction conditions and a yield of up to 99&#8201;% make the strategy more practical and attractive for constructing a new C&#8722;N bond.







Abstract
A thiocarbamate&#8208;directed Cp*Co(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H oxidative amidation of olefins is achieved to synthesize a series of enamines. The key feature of this protocol is the use of earth&#8208;abundant cobalt as catalyst and thiocarbamate as directing group, which provides an efficient and simple manner to synthesize enamines in good yields with high (Z)&#8208;selectivity. This reaction proceeds smoothly under very mild conditions (rt and air), and a wide range of functionalized alkenes, as well as dioxazolones, were compatible with the standard reaction conditions.

         <title>On the Origin of Regioselectivity in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidation of Glucosides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 4, Page 632-636, January 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The physical factors behind the remarkable site&#8208;selectivity in palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of unprotected glucosides was uncovered. The regioselectivity is traced back to the presence of the ring oxygen which steers the reactivity in order to minimize inductive charge repulsion.







Abstract
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of glucopyranosides has been investigated using relativistic density functional theory (DFT) at ZORA&#8208;BLYP&#8722;D3(BJ)/TZ2P. The complete Gibbs free energy profiles for the oxidation of secondary hydroxy groups at C2, C3, and C4 were computed for methyl &#946;&#8208;glucoside and methyl carba&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucoside. Both computations and oxidation experiments on carba&#8208;glucosides demonstrate the crucial role of the ring oxygen in the C3 regioselectivity observed during the oxidation of glucosides. Analysis of the model systems for oxidized methyl &#946;&#8208;glucoside shows that the C3 oxidation product is intrinsically favored in the presence of the ring oxygen.

     alt="On the Origin of Regioselectivity in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidation of Glucosides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physical factors behind the remarkable site&#8208;selectivity in palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of unprotected glucosides was uncovered. The regioselectivity is traced back to the presence of the ring oxygen which steers the reactivity in order to minimize inductive charge repulsion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of glucopyranosides has been investigated using relativistic density functional theory (DFT) at ZORA&#8208;BLYP&#8722;D3(BJ)/TZ2P. The complete Gibbs free energy profiles for the oxidation of secondary hydroxy groups at C2, C3, and C4 were computed for methyl &#946;&#8208;glucoside and methyl carba&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucoside. Both computations and oxidation experiments on carba&#8208;glucosides demonstrate the crucial role of the ring oxygen in the C3 regioselectivity observed during the oxidation of glucosides. Analysis of the model systems for oxidized methyl &#946;&#8208;glucoside shows that the C3 oxidation product is intrinsically favored in the presence of the ring oxygen. Subsequent energy decomposition analysis (EDA) and Hirschfeld charge analysis reveal the role of the ring oxygen: it positively polarizes C1/C5 by inductive effects and disfavors any subsequent buildup of positive charge at neighboring carbon atoms, rendering C3 the most favored site for the &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination.&lt;/p&gt;

The one&#8208;pot ligand&#8208;free palladium&#8208;catalyzed &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydrogenation of ketone and sequential aza&#8208;Micahel addition was developed, which provides N&#8208;Tf 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydroquinolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;ones in moderate to good yields.

Abstract
2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydroquinolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;ones have recently been identified as important structures with potent biological activities such as antitumor and antidiabetic effect. Herein, a total of 25 novel N&#8208;Tf 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydroquinolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;ones were expediently synthesized via the oxidative aza&#8208;Michael cyclization of N&#8208;Tf&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;aminodihydrochalcones by ligand&#8208;free palladium(II) catalysis. This study presents a new synthetic approach to yield N&#8208;Tf 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydroquinolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;ones, which can be easily transformed into pharmacologically interesting aza&#8208;flavanones and other N&#8208;heterocycles, such as quinolines and tetrahydroquinolines, in yields up to 84&#8201;%. This methodology has various advantages, which includes short reaction times under mild conditions and suitable functional group tolerance. Furthermore, a plausible mechanism was proposed and demonstrated by kinetic analysis.

         <title>Formal semisynthesis of demethylgorgosterol utilizing a stereoselective intermolecular cyclopropanation reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study we report a convenient and high yielding formal semisynthesis of demethylgorgosterol, a marine steroid with an intriguing sidechain containing a cyclopropane unit. This was achieved through the synthesis of an advanced ketone intermediate. The synthetic route features a total of ten steps, starting from commercially available stigmasterol, with an overall yield of 27%. The key step was a stereoselective intermolecular cyclopropanation. This reaction proceeded in 82% yield, the resulting cyclopropane carboxylic ester shows a trans/cis ratio of 89:11, with a diastereomeric ratio for the trans&#8208;diastereomers of &gt;99:1. A reduction/oxidation sequence afforded the corresponding aldehyde, which was used in a Grignard reaction. A final oxidation step then yielded the desired ketone. This novel route presents a platform to further investigate the medicinal applications of gorgosterol&#8208;type steroids and to fully understand their role in coral symbiosis.</dc:description>

NH&#8208; and NCH  3  &#8208; oxazines reacted at lower temperatures than the thio&#8208; analogs, showing lower thermal stability, while NCH  2  Ph&#8208; compounds presented the opposite behavior. Oxazines and thiazines yielded different products through homolytic fragmentations of the heterocycle moiety, the stability of which increased with the N&#8208;substitution. Based on the analysis of the reaction temperatures and the unraveling of the obtained products, it is proposed that any heterocyclic ring&#8208;opening reactions (initiated by X3&#8208;C4, C8a&#8208;N1, or C2&#8208;X3 bond rupture) require less energy than the retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder process (RDA) that yields butadiene. This concerted reaction path is only achieved at temperatures higher than 470&#186;C. Kinetic measurements reveal negative entropies of activation, which suggest a partially concerted way of reaction or slightly asynchronous fragmentation processes, with higher energy of activation (Ea) values for the N&#8208;substituted derivatives compared to the unsubstituted ones. Experimental results agree with calculations at the DFT level (B3LYP/6&#8208;311+G(d,p)) and M06&#8208;2X (6&#8208;311+G(d,p))&#160; from Gaussian09 software.</dc:description>

         <title>Updating the CSIC Reaction (2003&#8211;2020)</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mini review describes the progress and developments of the CSIC [Carbanion&#8208;mediated Sulfonate (Sulfonamide) Intermolecular Coupling (or Intramolecular Cyclization)] reaction over the past 17&#8197;years, since 2003, when the first thematic review on the CSIC reaction was published.







Abstract
Herein, we have updated the progress and developments of the Carbanion&#8208;mediated Sulfonate (or Sulfonamide) Intermolecular Coupling, and Intramolecular Cyclization, abbreviated as CSIC reaction (CSICr), in the last seventeen years from the seminal review published in 2003 in this same Journal. CSICr has proven to be a useful and versatile synthetic tool, efficiently providing a number of open&#8208;chain [alkane(sulfonamide)sulfonates] or cylic (sultams and sultones) synthetic intermediates or final products of high value in organic and medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Non&#8208;Canonical Reactivity of Gold Carbene with Alkyne: An Overview of the Mechanistic Premise</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of gold carbene with alkyne have been discussed with the emphasis on the possible mechanisms, while also focusing on the energetics of the key intermediates as studied in some of the crucial reports covered herein.







Abstract
The unique nature of gold carbene and its synchronous counterpart gold&#8208;stabilized carbocation, is mainly responsible for the non&#8208;canonical reactivity profile that it demonstrates in comparison to any other transition metal carbene. Being an important subset to this class, reactions of gold carbene with alkyne sponsor products far more diverse than cyclopropenation as canonically expected in case of other transition metal carbenes. These gold&#8208;catalyzed reactions have largely been proposed to follow either a [1,n]&#8208;carbene transfer process or an alternate pathway involving a direct interception of the &#946;&#8208;gold vinyl cation with a nucleophile at the cationic carbon. Despite of a clear distinction in structure, bonding and energy of a vinyl gold carbene and &#946;&#8208;gold vinyl cation; they have been found to exhibit identical reactivities like cyclopropenation, C(sp2)&#8211;H insertion, etc. making it extremely difficult to &#8220;experimentally&#8221; investigate and validate a mechanistic pathway. It is because of lack of conclusive experimental evidence, in addition to the limited number of detailed computational studies, that multiple pathways have been proposed simultaneously to rationalize the product formation. As an effort to shed light on the mechanisms of these reactions, herein, documentation of these reactions with a focus on their mechanistic premise has been presented.

         <title>Synthesis of Trifluoromethylated Dithiocarbamates via Photocatalyzed Substitution Reaction: Pentafluoropyridine as Activating Reagent</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trifluoromethylation of aldehydes with subsequent derivatization using pentafluoropyridine provides pyridinyl ethers which undergo light mediated substitution by dithiocarbamate anion, affording fluorinated dithiocarbamates.







Abstract
A method for the synthesis of trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted dithiocarbamates from aldehydes is described. The reaction involves nucleophilic trifluoromethylation, derivatization of the silyloxy&#8208;group with pentafluoropyridine, and substitution of the fluorinated pyridinyloxy group by dithiocarbamate anion. The substitution step is performed in the presence of 12&#8208;phenyl&#8208;12H&#8208;benzo[b]phenothiazine and copper cyanide under irradiation of 400&#8197;nm LED.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formic acid is receiving attention as a promising hydrogen source as well as a valuable chemical for the industries of textiles, pharmaceuticals etc. This minireview is focused on the recent advancement in its formation from biomass, using oxidative pathways and different catalysts such as polyoxometalate, vanadium oxide, hydrothermal, and photocatalysis, developed over the past ten years.







Abstract
Formic acid (FA) is well&#8208;known as a promising hydrogen source as well as a valuable chemical for the industries of textiles, pharmaceuticals etc. In fact, 1.137&#8197;million&#8197;metric&#8197;tons of FA is required worldwide per year to meet the current demand. Therefore, there is a strong interest for the generation of FA in a sustainable way to meet the future demand. Inspired by this information, several strategies have been considered for the sustainable synthesis of FA. Herein, we summarise the recent articles for the oxidative transformation of biomass into FA.

         <title>Novel, Chiral, and Enantiopure C2&#8208;Symmetric Thioureas Promote Asymmetric Protio&#8208;Pictet&#8208;Spengler Reactions by Anion&#8208;Binding Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel L&#8208;valine&#8208;derived C2&#8208;symmetric thiourea catalyst, in combination with 4&#8208;methoxybenzoic acid, promoted the enantioselective reaction of tryptamines with aldehydes (protio&#8208;Pictet&#8208;Spengler reactions) to give the corresponding tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines with good enantioselectivity (up to 95&#8201;% ee) by chiral anion&#8208;binding catalysis.







Abstract
Although anion&#8208;binding processes are well&#8208;known for their crucial role in molecular recognition, they have only recently been utilized for catalysis. Herein, a new class of chiral, enantiopure C2&#8208;symmetrical thioureas that, in combination with 4&#8208;methoxybenzoic acid, promotes the enantioselective protio&#8208;Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction to provide unprotected tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines in good yields (40&#8211;93&#8201;%) and moderate&#8208;to&#8208;high enantioselectivities (34&#8211;95&#8201;% ee) in one step from tryptamine and aldehyde derivatives is described. The formation of a chiral catalyst&#8208;anion complex was explored by 1H NMR.

         <title>Synthesis and Determination of Absolute Configuration of Zealexin A1, a Sesquiterpenoid Phytoalexin from Zea mays</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective synthesis of zealexin A1, a macrocarpane&#8208;type sesquiterpene phytoalexin is described. Our methodology for the total synthesis involved the stereoselective construction of the stereogenic center via enzymatic resolution followed by Johnson&#8211;Claisen rearrangement. The absolute configuration of the natural product was determined by GC analyses of the synthetic and natural zealexin A1 methyl esters.







Abstract
The enantioselective synthesis of zealexin A1, a sesquiterpene phytoalexin isolated from maize Zea mays is described for the first time. Our methodology for the total synthesis of zealexin A1 involved the stereoselective construction of the stereogenic center via enzymatic resolution followed by Johnson&#8211;Claisen rearrangement. The absolute configuration of the natural product was determined through gas chromatography analyses for the methyl esters for both synthetic and natural zealexin A1.

         <title>The Riveting Chemistry of Poly&#8208;aza&#8208;heterocycles Employing Microwave Technique: A Decade Review</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present review discloses microwave&#8208;assisted chemistry of five/six&#8208;member poly&#8208;aza&#8208;heterocycles namely, triazole, tetrazole, triazine, and tetrazine. The emphasis has been made towards the advantages of microwave conditions over conventional process. The review unveils the latest synthetic approaches and potential applications originated from these heterocycles.







Abstract
The application of microwave technique in chemical laboratory rooted back in 1986 and found advantageous over conventional approaches. On the other side, poly&#8208;aza&#8208;heterocycles are influencing organic frameworks with a fascinating chemistry and well explored by employing microwave&#8208;assisted organic reactions. In the present review, we have thoroughly updated rousing literatures of microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis and reactions of various poly&#8208;aza&#8208;heterocycles viz., triazole, tetrazole, triazine, and tetrazine from the past decade (2010&#8211;2020). The expedient chemistry and enabling role of microwave heating for adequate chemical transformations of such heterocycles, which were more challenging using classical approaches, are appropriately elucidated. This review also highlights the potential applications of these heterocyclic scaffolds and their derivatives in different scientific domains. Remarkably, such chemical architects possess wide applications as crucial building blocks in synthesis of biologically relevant compounds, agrochemicals, and compounds of interest in material science.

&lt;p&gt;The present review discloses microwave&#8208;assisted chemistry of five/six&#8208;member poly&#8208;&lt;i&gt;aza&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;heterocycles namely, triazole, tetrazole, triazine, and tetrazine. The emphasis has been made towards the advantages of microwave conditions over conventional process. The review unveils the latest synthetic approaches and potential applications originated from these heterocycles.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application of microwave technique in chemical laboratory rooted back in 1986 and found advantageous over conventional approaches. On the other side, poly&#8208;&lt;i&gt;aza&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;heterocycles are influencing organic frameworks with a fascinating chemistry and well explored by employing microwave&#8208;assisted organic reactions. In the present review, we have thoroughly updated rousing literatures of microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis and reactions of various poly&#8208;&lt;i&gt;aza&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;heterocycles &lt;i&gt;viz&lt;/i&gt;., triazole, tetrazole, triazine, and tetrazine from the past decade (2010&#8211;2020). The expedient chemistry and enabling role of microwave heating for adequate chemical transformations of such heterocycles, which were more challenging using classical approaches, are appropriately elucidated. This review also highlights the potential applications of these heterocyclic scaffolds and their derivatives in different scientific domains. Remarkably, such chemical architects possess wide applications as crucial building blocks in synthesis of biologically relevant compounds, agrochemicals, and compounds of interest in material science.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Nickel&#8208; and Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aryl Fluorosulfonates and Phosphites: Synthesis of Aryl Phosphonates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient palladium or nickel&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;P bond formation proceeds with excellent yields under mild conditions. Direct conversion of phenol to aryl phosphonates in a single pot has been developed. Broad functional group compatibility enables the economical preparation of organophosphorus compounds.







Abstract
The synthesis of aryl phosphonates via nickel and palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of aryl fluorosulfonates and phosphites is described. The products were obtained in good to excellent yields under mild conditions with broad functional group compatibility, employing either Pd(OAc)2 and DPEPhos or the readily available NiCl2(dme) and Xantphos as catalytic systems. Noteworthily, the present C(sp2)&#8722;P bond formation method could be applied to the direct conversion of phenols to the corresponding aryl phosphonates in one pot via reaction of phenols with SO2F2 and subsequent palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling.

         <title>Klyflaccilins B&#8208;T, Polyoxgenated Eunicellins from the Soft Coral Klyxum flaccidum</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nineteen new eunicellin diterpenoids named klyflaccilins B&#8208;T were isolated from the gorgonian Klyxum flaccidum. The structures were elucidated by NMR, showing that they represent different eunicellin subclasses. For five compounds X&#8208;ray crystal structures were obtained that allowed to determine their absolute configurations.







Abstract
Nineteen polyoxygenated eunicellin diterpenoids, named klyflaccilins B&#8208;T (1&#8211;19), were isolated from the South China Sea soft coral Klyxum flaccidum. Their structures were established by extensive spectroscopic analysis and for several of the isolated compounds the absolute configurations were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

The tandem oxidative annulation of o&#8208;aminobenzamides and 1,3&#8208;diarylpropenes was mediated by DDQ via dual cross&#8208;dehydrogenative&#8208;coupling (CDC) reactions. It provides an efficient and convenient method for the synthesis of 2,2&#8208;disubstituted 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinazolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;ones.

Abstract
C3&#8208;symmetrical, alkoxyphenyl substituted 2,5,8&#8208;(tris&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzo [1,2&#8208;b; 3,4&#8208;b&#8242;; 5,6&#8208;b&#8242;&#8242;]trithiophenes (OXD&#8208;BTT) are synthesized via threefold Huisgen&#8208;reaction. A broad variation of alkoxy substitution pattern and chain lengths is reported. The thermal behavior was investigated via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), polarized optical microscopy (POM) and thermogravimetry (TGA). Optical properties were studied via UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. Structural information of the LC phases was gained from X&#8208;ray diffraction on oriented fibers. OXD&#8208;BTT provide enormous phase widths (&#916;T&#8805;289&#8197;K) with clearing points close to thermal decomposition. Most of the derivatives exhibit two different mesophases, the lower phase with a rectangular 3D&#8208;structure and a hexagonal 2D&#8208;lattice at higher temperature. The variation of the chain length allows a tuning of melting and clearing points. OXD&#8208;BTT emit blue light with fluorescence quantum yields up to 30&#8201;% in good solvents. The emission is very sensitive to aggregation, thus, in poor solvents the emission intensity decreases, and red shift of maxima occurs.

         <title>Chemistry for the Identification of Therapeutic Targets: Recent Advances and Future Directions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The earliest preclinical stages of drug discovery must generate information about the identity, the in&#8197;vivo engagement, and the endogenous levels of the targeted protein(s). In this review, we outline the main strategies by which chemical probes, compounds that rely on chemical reactions to give an answer to specific biological questions, are contributing to currently challenging biomedical applications.







Abstract
The increasing availability of chemical probes for specific applications in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry is extensively facilitating our knowledge of biological systems. This understanding has fundamental implications in the development of new efficacious therapeutic strategies. Nowadays, successful drug discovery programs consider identification, engagement, and endogenous levels of the intended therapeutic target from the earliest preclinical stages. All these aspects are addressed with the use of chemical probes, compounds that rely on the use of a particular chemical reaction to give an answer to a specific biological question. In this review we will describe the underlying chemistry and the most recent advances experienced in the field together with their most important biomedical applications.

         <title>Synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;epi&#8208;Jungianol by the Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Propargyl Claisen Rearrangement/Hydroarylation Cascade Reaction of Propargyl Vinyl Ethers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;  epi  &#8208;jungianol was successfully carried out by the gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed propargyl Claisen rearrangement/hydroarylation cascade reaction of suitably substituted propargyl vinyl ethers as the key step to form the indane skeleton. Two routes were compared, which involved substrates with a different degree of substitution on the vinyl moiety. The one based on a propargyl vinyl ether bearing an unsubstituted vinyl moiety, despite entailing two additional steps, provided the final compound in a higher overall yield. A method for the preparation of acid sensitive propargyl vinyl ethers with an &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;substituted vinyl moiety and their reactivity under gold catalysis is also reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of&#160;&#947;&#8208;Spirolactams by Birch Reduction of Arenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A convenient method for the synthesis&#160;of&#160;&#947;&#8208;spirolactams in only three steps is described. Birch reduction of inexpensive and commercially available aromatic carboxylic acids in the presence of chloroacetonitrile affords nitriles in moderate to good yields. Suitable precursors are methyl&#8208;substituted benzoic acids, naphthoic, and anthroic acid. Subsequent catalytic hydrogenation proceeds smoothly with PtO2&#160;or Raney Ni as catalysts and lactams are isolated in excellent yields and stereoselectivities. Thus, up to 3 new stereogenic centers can be constructed as sole diastereomers from achiral benzoic acids. Furthermore, it is possible to control the degree of saturation at different pressures, affording products with 0, 1, or 2 double bonds. Overall, more&#160;than 15 new&#160;&#947;&#8208;spirolactams&#160;have been synthesized in analytically pure form.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydroaminoalkylation/Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig Amination Sequences for the Synthesis of Novel Thieno&#8208; or Benzothieno&#8208;Annulated Tetrahydropyridines, Tetrahydroazasilines, and Tetrahydroazasilepines</title>

         <dc:description>
Hydroaminoalkylation reactions of 2&#8208;allyl&#8208;, 2&#8208;allyldimethylsilyl&#8208;, or 2&#8208;dimethyl(vinyl)silyl&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;bromothiophenes or 3&#8208;bromobenzothiophenes with secondary amines deliver the branched or the linear addition products with high regioselectivity. A combination of this reaction with a subsequent intramolecular Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination results in several one&#8208;pot processes that give direct access to structurally novel thiophene&#8208; or benzothiophene&#8208;annulated 6&#8208; and 7&#8208;membered heterocycles.







Abstract
New two&#8208;step procedures that include an initial regioselective intermolecular hydroaminoalkylation of 2&#8208;allyl&#8208;, 2&#8208;allyldimethylsilyl&#8208;, or 2&#8208;dimethyl(vinyl)silyl&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;bromothiophenes or 3&#8208;bromobenzothiophenes with secondary amines and a subsequent intramolecular Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination give direct access to structurally novel bicyclic heterocycles including tetrahydrothienopyridines, tetrahydrothienoazasilines, tetrahydrobenzothienoazasilines, and tetrahydrobenzothienoazasilepines. The hydroaminoalkylation reaction is catalyzed by a mono(aminopyridinato) titanium complex which delivers the branched hydroaminoalkylation products or in the case of vinylsilyl&#8208;substituted substrates, the use of a bis(aminopyridinato) titanium complex gives access to the linear regioisomers. While in the latter case, the hydroaminoalkylation products need to be purified prior to the palladium&#8208;catalyzed amination step, all other two&#8208;step sequences can be run as a one&#8208;pot procedure.

         <title>Molecular Recognition by Chalcogen Bond: Selective Charge&#8208;Transfer Crystal Formation of Dimethylnaphthalene with Selenadiazolotetracyanonaphthoquinodimethane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly selective cocrystallization with 2,6&#8208;dimethylnaphthalene (2,6&#8208;DMN) allows the title selenadiazole&#8208;based electron acceptor to separate 2,6&#8208;DMN from the isomer mixture by an effective Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N chalcogen bond whereas the sulfur congener shows only low selectivity due to the competing C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bond, which overwhelms the S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N bond.







Abstract
The title nonplanar electron acceptor (1) fused with a selenadiazole ring selectively forms a crystalline charge&#8208;transfer complex (CT crystal) with 2,6&#8208;dimethylnaphthalene (2,6&#8208;DMN). On the other hand, the sulfur analogue (2) has less recognition ability and forms CT crystals with both 2,6&#8208; and 2,7&#8208;DMN. X&#8208;ray analyses of 1, 2, and their CT crystals revealed that the Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N chalcogen bond (ChB) in 1 is strong enough to determine the crystal packing with the formation of a cavity suitable for 2,6&#8208;DMN. On the contrary, ChB through S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N contact in 2 competes with other weak interactions such as a C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bond. The stronger ChB involving Se is the key for 1 to separate 2,6&#8208;DMN (&gt;97&#8197;wt&#8201;%) from a complex isomer mixture containing ca. 10&#8197;wt&#8201;% each of 2,6&#8208; and 2,7&#8208;DMN by a simple, efficient and straightforward mixing&#8208;filtration&#8208;heating process.

         <title>Recent Developments in Deaminative Functionalization of Alkyl Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkyl amines could serve as alkyl radical precursors to construct C&#8722;C bonds and C&#8722;X bonds via C(sp3)&#8722;N cleavage. This review covered recent developments in the deaminative functionalization of alkyl amines.







Abstract
The amino group is one of the most prevalent functional groups present in a wide range of organic molecules, which has been widely applied in various organic synthesis and pharmaceuticals. Alkyl amines could be converted in a single step into Katritzky salts which could serve as alkyl radical precursors to construct C&#8722;C bonds and C&#8722;X bonds via C(sp3)&#8722;N cleavage. This deaminative functionalization could be carried out under transition&#8208;metal catalysis, photocatalysis, carbene catalysis or promoted by base. In this paper, recent developments in the deaminative functionalization of alkyl amines were covered. This review was categorized into four parts according to the nature of the bond formation. Some representative examples and corresponding reaction mechanisms were also summarized.

In this paper, recent developments in the deaminative functionalization of alkyl amines were covered. This review was categorized into four parts according to the nature of the bond formation. Some representative examples and corresponding reaction mechanisms were also summarized.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Reactions of a novel propyne iminium salt, N,N&#8208;dimethyl 3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;propyne iminium triflate, with electron&#8208;rich heteroaromatic ring systems (furans, thiophenes, pyrroles) are reported. The 1&#8208;CF3&#8208;propyne iminium ion can act as a highly reactive ambident electrophile, giving rise to simple electrophilic heteroaromatic ring substitution products, and as a 1,3&#8208;biselectrophile leading to C2+C3&#8208;CF3 annulation products. Moreover, it is an electron&#8208;deficient alkyne which was found to afford double [2+2] cycloaddition products with 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran and 2,5&#8208;dimethylthiophene. The obtained molecular structures include CF3&#8208;containing compounds with cyclopenta[b]furan, cyclopenta[b]thiophene, cyclopenta[c]thiophene, cyclopenta[b]pyrrole, cyclopenta[c]pyrrole, 3H&#8208;pyrrolizine, and 1,4&#8208;dihydrocyclopenta[b]pyrrole ring systems. Analogous reactions of 1,3(or 1,4)&#8208;phenylenebis(1&#8208;CF3&#8208;propyne iminium) salts with furans, pyrroles or thiophenes in a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry lead to phenylene&#8208;tethered condensed heterocycles of the same type.

         <title>Stereochemistry of a Cyclic Epicatechin Trimer with C3 Symmetry Produced by Oxidative Coupling</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows the structure of a cyclic epicatechin trimer produced by oxidative coupling. The trimer has a C3 symmetric structure shaped like three cats sleeping. Its stereostructure was assigned on the basis of various spectroscopic data, including theoretical calculations of the NMR and ECD data. Epicatechin is a type of plant polyphenol and is present in various foods such as green tea, apples, grapes, and cocoa. During black tea production, various dimers and trimers of tea catechins, probably including the cyclic epicatechin trimer as well, are generated via enzymatic oxidation. More information can be found in the Communication by Y. Matsuo, T. Tanaka et&#8197;al.

         <title>Nucleophilic Alkoxylations of Unactivated Alkyl Olefins and &#945;&#8208;Methyl Styrene by Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows an illustration how N&#8208;phenylphenothiazines can be used as photoredox catalysts for the photoreduction of alkylated olefins and subsequent nucleophilic addition by alcohols. Compared to conventional photoredox catalyst, such as [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and eosin Y, N&#8208;phenylphenothiazine have significantly more reducing power that is crucial for the photoinduced electron transfer to alkylated and thus non&#8208;activated olefins. This photoredox catalytic method tolerates many functional groups in the substrates. More information can be found in the Communication by Hans&#8208;Achim Wagenknecht et&#8197;al.

         <title>Synthesis of Enantiopure 6,11&#8208;Methylene Lipoxin B4 Methyl Ester</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible convergent enantioselective total synthesis of a rigid lipoxin B4 analog incorporating a 6, 11&#8208;methylene bridge has been developed. C1&#8211;C12 aldehyde and C13&#8211;C20 ketophosphonate underwent highly efficient key Horner olefination. A final six&#8208;step sequence delivered the target compound displaying all stereogenic centers with standard lipoxin B4 configurations.







Abstract
The synthesis of Lipoxin B4 analogs (LXB4) to gain access to stabilized inflammation resolving compounds is an actual field of research. Focusing on variation and stabilization of the conjugated E,Z,E,E C6&#8211;C13 tetraene moiety of natural LXB4, a methylene bridge introduced between C6 and C11 suppresses any Z/E isomerization of the C8&#8211;C9 olefin. Intending to enable prospective structure variations in connection with the C1&#8211;C5 and C14&#8211;C20 fragments, a convergent total synthesis has been developed. Optically active C1&#8211;C12 building blocks were build&#8208;up from cycloheptatriene 1&#8208;carbonester (C6&#8211;C11, C21) and glutaryl chloride (C1&#8211;C5) using Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type acylation and chiral HPLC. The C13&#8211;C20 segment had been generated via a five&#8208;step sequence starting from heptanoyl chloride. Horner key olefination enabled the assembly of the carbon backbone. A final five&#8208;step sequence including a chelate Cram reduction of the unsaturated ketone moiety afforded the target 6,11&#8208;methylene LXB4 methyl ester.

         <title>Photoredox Allylation Reactions Mediated by Bismuth in Aqueous Conditions.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organometallic allylic reagents are widely used in the construction of C&#8208;C bond by Barbier&#8208;type reactions. In this communication, we have described a photoredox Barbier allylation of aldehydes mediated by bismuth, in absence of other metals as co&#8208;reductants. Mild reaction conditions, tolerance of oxygen, and use of aqueous solvent make this photoredox methodology attractive for green and sustainable synthesis of homoallylic alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>A one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step enzymatic pathway for the synthesis of enantiomerically enriched vicinal diols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantiomerically enriched 1,2&#8208;diols are prominent compounds that find numerous applications in organic chemistry. They are privileged building blocks for the synthesis of APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients), broadly used as chiral ligands in asymmetric catalysis, and efficient auxiliaries employed to control the stereochemical outcome of total synthesis. Among the number of strategies developed for the preparation of these molecules, enzyme mediated reactions have gained a crucial role in the toolbox of organic chemists for their high efficiency and sustainability. Herein we describe a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step protocol designed by combining a thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)&#8208;dependent lyase and a NADH&#8208;dependent reductase. The ThDP&#8208;dependent acetoin:dichlorophenolindophenol oxidoreductase (Ao:DCPIP OR) is exploited to produce enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;hydroxyketones through the benzoin&#8208;type condensation of methylacetoin with either aldehydes or activated ketones. The enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;hydroxyketones undergo the selective reduction into the corresponding 1,2&#8208;diols in the same reaction mixture due to the addition of NAD  +  and of the NADH&#8208;dependent acetylacetoin reductase (AAR). Sodium formate was selected as the sacrificial reductive reactant to generate and recycle  in situ  the precious NADH by formate&#8208;dehydrogenase. Unprecedented reported details on the cloning and expression of the AAR are reported as well.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Ring&#8208;Opening of meso&#8208;Epoxides with O&#8208; and N&#8208;Nucleophiles Catalyzed by a Chiral Sc(III)/bipyridine Complex</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ring&#8208;opening of epoxides is a synthetically significant process widely applied in all kinds of chemistry. Herein, we report the catalytic and highly enantioselective variant of this reaction exploiting our recent endeavors to design and synthesize chiral bipyridine type ligands. A Sc&#8208;complex with a newly developed bipyridine ligand exhibited high reactivity and stereocontrol in the desymmetrization of  meso  &#8208;epoxides with various alcohols. The respective enantiomerically enriched 1,2&#8208;alkoxyalcohols were obtained with e.rs up to 99.5:0.5 for various alcohols regardless of their nature (benzyl, alkyl, cycloalkyl, allyl, propargyl, etc.). We attempted ring&#8208;opening of  meso  &#8208;epoxides with anilines as well; however, it proceeded with lower enantioselectivity and strongly depended on the electronic effect of substituents attached to the aromatic ring.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, self&#8208;assembly and nucleic acid recognition of an acylhydrazone&#8208;conjugated cationic tetraphenylethene ligand</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers are of interest in the pursuit of multivalent nucleic acids recognition. However, their formation often relies on non&#8208;covalent forces that are also at play in the interaction with nucleic acids. In this work, we designed a novel compound (  TPE&#8208;Gir  ) combining a tetraphenylethene aromatic core tethered to four quaternary ammoniums through acylhydrazone spacers, and we investigated in details its self&#8208;assembly and interaction with different types of nucleic acids. The spectroscopic analyses indicate the self&#8208;assembly of regular fluorescent nanoparticles (observed by DLS and TEM) in the absence of nucleic acids, the strong propensity to intercalate into single&#8208;stranded DNA, the ability to bind into the minor groove of double&#8208;stranded DNA, and the selective binding to G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures by fitting within a wide G4&#8208;groove. Those recognition events are quantified by isothermal titration calorimetry and the proposed binding models are supported by docking simulations.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cannabidiol is one of the main non&#8208;psychoactive cannabinoids present in Cannabis sativa and in the last decade, it is gaining great interest among the scientific community for its pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and cosmetic applications. Herein, we report the first continuous flow chemical synthesis of cannabidiol (CBD) and its analogues cannabidivarin (CBDV) and cannabidibutol (CBDB). This approach permits to synthesize products in very good yields (55&#8208;59%), limiting the formation of psychoactive and illegal cannabinoids such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Decarboxylative Radical Addition Reactions for Late Stage Functionalization of Peptide Substrates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In our contribution we showcase an application of photochemistry for Late Stage Functionalization (LSF) of amino acids and small peptides in an industrial medicinal chemistry environment. The radical intermediates generated under photochemical conditions from the C&#8208;terminal carboxylates undergo rapid 1,4&#8208;conjugate additions to a variety of Michael acceptors. The studied methodology is applicable to the functionalization of established drugs and drug precursors.







Abstract
Photoredox chemistry has greatly stimulated the application of radical based transformations in medicinal chemistry and early drug discovery in recent years. Carboxylate groups have been identified as traceless leaving groups that can be converted into radical intermediates capable of undergoing 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition reactions to Michael acceptors. Herein, we show the successful C&#8208;terminal derivatization of small peptide substrates by using this methodology in a parallel synthesis setting. Finally, we outline a general strategy for the &#947;&#8208;homologation of several drugs derived from &#945;&#8208;amino acids in a late stage functionalization (LSF) approach.

         <title>Copper&#8208;catalyzed [3+2+1] annulation of anthranils with phenylacetaldehydes: Synthesis of 8&#8208;acylquinolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu0&#8208;catalyzed protocol is proposed for the synthesis of 8&#8208;acylquinolines through a [3+2+1] annulation starting from anthranils and phenylacetaldehydes. This protocol is of particular interest in preparing 8&#8208;aldehyde quinolines, which have been hard to access so far. Both AgOTf and dioxygen played an important role in the reaction. C3&#8208;heterocycle or phenylethylene substituted anthranils could also be employed in the reaction. An interesting esterification of aldehyde was observed.

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclopropanation of Indoles Using &#945;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoacetates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic amount (10&#8197;mol%) of triflic imide (HNTf2) as a Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst stereoselectively catalyzes the cyclopropanation of N&#8208;protected indoles with &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoacetates. The use of a catalytic amount (4&#8197;mol%) of phenylacetate greatly improved the efficiency of the cyclopropanation.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free cyclopropanation of N&#8208;protected indoles with &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoacetates proceeded by using a catalytic amount of triflic imide as a Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst. The use of a catalytic amount of methyl phenylacetate improved the efficiency of the Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation. A reaction mechanism including C&#8208;protonation of diazoacetates with HNTf2, followed by formal [3+2] cycloaddition with indoles and 1,3&#8208;rearrangement was proposed for the cyclopropanation.

         <title>Two&#8208;Step Protocol for Iodotrimethylsilane&#8208;Mediated Deoxy&#8208;Functionalization of Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a two&#8208;step protocol for iodotrimethylsilane&#8208;mediated deoxy&#8208;functionalization of primary and secondary alcohols to afford products containing a C&#8211;N, C&#8211;S, or C&#8211;O bond. In the first step the alcohol undergoes iodination with iodotrimethylsilane, and in the second, the iodine atom is replaced by a N, S, or O nucleophile. Compared with the traditional Mitsunobu reaction, this reaction has a wider substrate scope. In addition, non&#8208;acidic pre&#8208;nucleophiles can be used, and the reaction proceeds with retention of configuration. This operationally simple, highly efficient protocol can be used for late&#8208;stage derivatization of hydroxy&#8208;group containing natural products and drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Chemistry of High&#8208;Oxidation State Securinega Alkaloids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Securinega alkaloids have fascinated the chemical community for over six decades. Among these intriguing secondary metabolites, there are members that are biosynthesized via oxidation(s) of the basic tetracyclic core of securinega natural products. These oxidation processes result in a sub&#8208;family of natural products with intriguing structural variations. We have grouped them as &#8220;high&#8208;oxidation state&#8221; securinega alkaloids. In this minireview, we, for the first time, categorize high&#8208;oxidation state securinega alkaloids into five groups based on their structural phenotype. We then describe all known syntheses of high&#8208;oxidation state securinega alkaloids based on our classification. Plausible biosynthetic origins of securinega alkaloids in each group are described. Notable interplays between chemical synthesis and biosynthesis within this family of natural products are depicted. The updated comprehensive investigation of the chemistry of high&#8208;oxidation state securinega alkaloids provides us with an outlook on remaining key challenges related to these fascinating natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Molecular Cages Based on Cyclotriveratrylene and Sucrose Units Connected with p&#8208;Phenylene Linkers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of four diastereoisomeric molecular cages based on CTV and sucrose moieties connected with p&#8208;phenylene linkers is reported. These compounds were structurally characterized by advanced NMR and ECD spectroscopies. In case of P&#8208;4&#8201;b cage, a crystal structure was obtained. The binding studies towards small ammonium salts were investigated.







Abstract
Four diastereomeric molecular cages based on cyclotriveratrylene (CTV) and sucrose scaffolds, connected via p&#8208;phenylene linkers, were synthesized in a few steps synthesis. The absolute configuration of these diastereoisomers was determined by advanced NMR and ECD spectroscopies supported by DFT calculations. The X&#8208;Ray crystal structure of P&#8208;4&#8201;b cage gave an insight into its unique structure. The binding properties of P&#8208;4&#8201;a and M&#8208;4&#8201;a cages towards small ammonium guests (1&#8208;methylpyridinium and 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolium salts) were investigated.

         <title>Electrostatic favors PNA stability over stereochemistry: Synthesis and biophysical studies of cationic dual&#8208;backbone PNA analogues</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modifications to the PNA backbone has been well known to alter the thermodynamical parameters of PNA:DNA complexes to broaden their utility for different applications. Electrostatic interactions between a modified PNA having a positively charged backbone and the negatively charged DNA has been shown to enhance thermal stabilities of PNA:DNA complexes at various instances.&#160; On the other hand, introduction of chirality in PNA backbone leads to stereochemical preference that affects binding properties. However, the interplay between electrostatics and stereochemistry has not been systematically studied so far. Here, we report the synthesis and biophysical characterization of cationic PNA named dapPNA, first of its kind, having a dual PNA backbone constituting of a pyrrolidine ring having a &#946;&#8208;substitution.&#160; One of the aims of this study was to investigate the role of electrostatics over stereochemical preferences. The results show that electrostatic attraction between cationic dapPNA and negatively charged DNA overcomes the unfavourable stereochemical effects and enhances stability of PNA:DNA complexes. Moreover, two different PNA backbones derived from a single PNA monomer might help to tune thermal stabilities of PNA:DNA complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Isoriccardin C through a C&#8211;H Activated Heck Type Macrocyclization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocyclization is typically the key step in syntheses of cyclophane&#8208;type natural products. Considering compounds with axially chiral biaryl moieties, the control of atroposelectivity is essential for biological activity and is synthetically challenging. Herein we report on atroposelective macrocyclization involving an oxidative Heck type process and enabling the first atropo&#8208;enantiopure synthesis of isoriccardin C. A chiral sulfinyl auxiliary in the ortho&#8208;position of a biaryl axis (still flexible) was used to induce a C&#8211;H activated atropodiastereoselective oxidative Heck coupling (&gt;98% de). The traceless character of the sulfinyl auxiliary enables the introduction of a hydroxy group to give the target molecule with &gt;98% ee as well.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Sulfonylureas</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfonylureas are extensively used as hypoglycemic drugs, plant growth regulators or herbicides, and as promising drugs to treat inflammatory diseases. The different protocols for the synthesis of sulfonylurea derivatives have been grouped into two main classes according to the N&#8722;C or N&#8242;&#8722;C carbonyl chemical bonds of the urea moiety selected to be formed in the salient synthesis step.







Abstract
Sulfonylureas are employed in a variety of applications including use as drugs to treat type II diabetes and as plant growth regulators or herbicides. Traditionally, the synthesis of sulfonylureas has been accomplished either by the treatment of sulfamides with isocyanates in the presence of a base or through sulfonamides conversion into N&#8208;sulfonyl isocyanates or N&#8208;sulfonyl carbamate derivatives which provide the corresponding sulfonylureas upon treatment with amines. Both approaches are severely limited by the weak nucleophilicity of sulfamides and by the difficulty in synthesizing and handling isocyanate species. Such a drawback could be mitigated by the emergence of protocols establishing the labile electrophilic functional groups in&#8197;situ so that their coupling with nucleophilic partners takes place in one&#8208;pot. Recently, the development of environmentally friendly methods to prepare sulfonylurea containing compounds without using harmful reagents has attracted considerable attention. The aim of the minireview is to explore the different protocols emerged in the literature to generate sulfonylureas giving importance to the reaction mechanisms of crucial synthetic steps.

         <title>Nucleophilic Alkoxylations of Unactivated Alkyl Olefins and &#945;&#8208;Methyl Styrene by Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoredox catalytic addition of alcohols to non&#8208;activated terminal alkyl olefins is obtained by the use of N,N&#8208;diisobutylamino&#8208;phenylphenothiazine. Its excited state redox potential is sufficiently high to promote the photoreduction.







Abstract
N,N&#8208;diisobutylaminophenyl&#8208;phenothiazine is a strongly reducing catalyst that allows &#8211; for the first time &#8211; the photoredox catalytic addition of alcohols to alkyl olefins as non&#8208;activated substrates to products with Markovnikov orientation. The irradiation at 365&#8197;nm does not require any additional reagent. Using &#945;&#8208;methyl styrene as activated substrate we additionally show that this photoredox catalytic method tolerates other functional groups, including allyl, alkynyl, cyanide, and even acid&#8208;labile Boc groups within the substrate scope.

         <dc:description>In this paper, rhodium&#8208;catalyzed sequential twofold ortho &#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization of N &#8208;phenylbenzimidamide with internal alkyne is studied.

The operationally simple transformation showed high functional group compatibility and featured with cleavage of the C&#8208;H bonds located on different moiety of the N &#8208;phenylbenzimidamide substrates. Detailed mechanistic studies provided strong support for C&#8722;H bond cleavage on N &#8208;phenyl ring is preferential than C&#8208;H bond on C&#8208;phenyl ring.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Formation of &#948;&#8208;Lactones by Cerium&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Coupling of &#946;&#8208;Oxoesters with Enol Acetates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of the cerium&#8208;catalyzed radical coupling reaction of &#946;&#8208;oxoesters, enol acetates, and dioxygen was elucidated by the introduction of cyclopropyl substituents and stereocenters in the starting materials. The 1,2&#8208;alkyl shift within the endoperoxidic oxycarbenium intermediate proceeded with retention of configuration.







Abstract
&#948;&#8208;Valerolactone derivatives are formed by the cerium&#8208;catalyzed, aerobic coupling of &#946;&#8208;oxoesters with enol acetates and dioxygen. The products possess a 1,4&#8208;diketone moiety, thus, the conversion can be regarded as an Umpolung since the &#946;&#8208;oxoesters are oxidized to electrophilic &#945;&#8208;radicals. The transformation has similarities to the Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation (BVO) where the higher substituted residue migrates. An endoperoxidic oxycarbenium ion comparable to the Criegee intermediate in the BVO is proposed as a reaction intermediate in this case of the oxidative C&#8722;C coupling reaction, but in contrast to the BVO, the less substituted alkyl residue migrates. It was demonstrated by the conversion of &#946;&#8208;oxoesters with two stereocenters that this 1,2&#8208;alkyl shift proceeds with retention of configuration. A radical chain mechanism of the coupling reaction was furthermore evidenced by the conversion of enol acetates and &#946;&#8208;oxoesters with cyclopropyl substituents. Isolation and characterization of products with opened cyclopropane rings established the constitution of radical intermediates.

         <title>Regioselective Electrochemical Cyclobutanol Ring Expansion to 1&#8208;Tetralones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new electrochemical approach to the oxidative ring expansion of functionalized cyclobutanols is reported. Aryl and heteroaryl 1&#8208;tetralones are synthesized under mild and cost&#8208;efficient conditions. The newly designed methodology proves to be tolerant of a good range of functional groups and its application to larger scale syntheses is shown to be feasible.







Abstract
A mild electrochemical method for the regioselective preparation of 1&#8208;tetralones under environmentally friendly conditions from readily available cyclobutanols was developed. A series of aromatic&#8208; and heteroaromatic&#8208;fused 1&#8208;tetralones was accessed through ring expansion of the functionalized cyclobutanols via electrochemical generation of alkoxy radicals and intramolecular cyclization.

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Evaluation of &#945;&#8208;(Hydroxymethyl)cycloalkanols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;(Hydroxymethyl)cycloalkanol derivatives are raising increasing interest due to their robustness and their biological and chemical applications. This review takes an overview of the literature for the occurrence and synthesis of such derivatives, concentrating on advances in the last two decades.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;(Hydroxymethyl)cycloalkanols are pervasive structural scaffolds found in natural products and synthetic intermediates with varied biochemical and physicochemical properties. These profiles have driven numerous research groups to the synthesis of such motifs using innovative methodologies. The presence of vicinal diols attached to a cycloalkane makes from these motifs excellent synthetic intermediates for the synthesis of diverse ring systems. This investigation takes an overview of the literature for the occurrence and synthesis of &#945;&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)cycloalkanol derivatives, concentrating on advances in the last two decades.

         <title>C(sp2)&#8722;Si Bond Functionalization through Intramolecular Activation by Alkoxides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview covers recent progress in the functionalization of C(sp2)&#8722;Si bonds by intramolecular activation by alkoxides. Such processes involve the formation of a cyclic hypervalent silicon intermediate that allows carbon&#8208;to&#8208;oxygen migration of the organosilyl group and thus the formation of a carbanionic species poised to undergo electrophilic substitution. The C(sp2)&#8722;Si bond cleavage can be &#8220;endocyclic&#8221; (Brook rearrangement) or &#8220;exocyclic&#8221;.







Abstract
Organosilicon reagents are invaluable tools in the hands of the modern chemist that allow accomplishing a number of synthetically useful transformations. While some are standard reactions, others are more complex transformations, such as the Brook rearrangement and its variants. This carbon&#8208;to&#8208;oxygen silyl migration represents a privileged method to generate transient carbanionic species well suited to undergo functionalization upon electrophilic substitution in the presence of an electrophile. This minireview focuses on recent advances in C(sp2)&#8722;Si bond functionalization through intramolecular activation by alkoxides. The key elements of reactivity will be highlighted in the introduction to allow the proper understanding of the migration process.

     alt="C(sp2)&#8722;Si Bond Functionalization through Intramolecular Activation by Alkoxides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This minireview covers recent progress in the functionalization of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;Si bonds by intramolecular activation by alkoxides. Such processes involve the formation of a cyclic hypervalent silicon intermediate that allows carbon&#8208;to&#8208;oxygen migration of the organosilyl group and thus the formation of a carbanionic species poised to undergo electrophilic substitution. The C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;Si bond cleavage can be &#8220;endocyclic&#8221; (Brook rearrangement) or &#8220;exocyclic&#8221;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organosilicon reagents are invaluable tools in the hands of the modern chemist that allow accomplishing a number of synthetically useful transformations. While some are standard reactions, others are more complex transformations, such as the Brook rearrangement and its variants. This carbon&#8208;to&#8208;oxygen silyl migration represents a privileged method to generate transient carbanionic species well suited to undergo functionalization upon electrophilic substitution in the presence of an electrophile. This minireview focuses on recent advances in C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;Si bond functionalization through intramolecular activation by alkoxides. The key elements of reactivity will be highlighted in the introduction to allow the proper understanding of the migration process. Then, an overview of the reactivity of substrates incorporating the C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;Si motif and their synthetic applications will be provided.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Trimodular solution phase protocol for rapid large&#8208;scale synthesis of hydrogen bond surrogate&#8208;constrained &#945;&#8208;helicomimics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Scalability, optimal reagent usage, high yields, easy isolation and cost&#8208;effectiveness, are key for the applicability of synthetic methodologies in production of potential therapeutics. Hydrogen bond surrogate (HBS) constrained &#945;&#8208;helical peptides (&#945;&#8208;helicomimics) have shown promise as therapeutics based on their efficiency to interfere with protein&#8208;biomolecular interactions. The propyl HBS&#8208;constrained &#945;&#8208;helicomimics have shown highest helicities in both single turn and extended, &#945;&#8208;helices (ST&#945;H, E&#945;H). Here we present a solution phase synthetic (SPS) method, for the rapid, large scale, low cost synthesis of libraries of ST&#945;H and E&#945;H in high yields. The key to the efficiency is our trimodular (M  1  , M  2  , M  3  ) synthetic protocol where M  1  is a library of HBS&#8208;linked peptidomimetic synthons of both ST&#945;H and E&#945;H; M  2  and M  3  are desired oligopeptide libraries. Advantages of the trimodular method over conventional unimodular methods are demonstrated through synthesis of large&#8208;scale libraries of M  1  , ST&#945;H and E&#945;H.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Benzotriazoles via [3+2] Cycloaddition of Azides and Arynes in Flow</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted benzotriazoles are prepared from arynes and azides in a metal&#8208;free [3+2] cycloaddition within minutes. Using a flow reactor, thermal strain of hazardous azides is minimized for a readily scalable and safe process.







Abstract
A method for the metal&#8208;free synthesis of benzotriazoles in flow is reported. Using azides and in&#8197;situ generated arynes, benzotriazoles are formed in a [3+2] cycloaddition within minutes. Employing different substitution patterns of the azide and aryne coupling partners, a modular access to benzotriazoles is provided. Thermal strain of hazardous azides and accumulation of reactive intermediates is minimized by short reaction times in flow, improving the safety profile of the process. The scalability of the reaction is demonstrated.

         <title>Stereochemistry of a Cyclic Epicatechin Trimer with C3 Symmetry Produced by Oxidative Coupling</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclic epicatechin trimer with C3 symmetry, connected through C&#8722;C bonds between A&#8208; and B&#8208;rings, was isolated as an oxidative coupling product of (&#8722;)&#8208;epicatechin in the presence of polyphenol oxidase. Its stereochemistry was assigned using 1D and 2D NMR, and theoretical calculations of the NMR and ECD data. We suggest that the less strained cyclic trimer with the (aR,aR,aR) configuration was formed atroposelectively in the cyclization process.







Abstract
A cyclic epicatechin trimer with C3 symmetry, connected through C&#8722;C bonds between A&#8208; and B&#8208;rings, was isolated as an oxidative coupling product of (&#8722;)&#8208;epicatechin with polyphenol oxidase. It was previously isolated as an oxidation product of epicatechin with CuCl2; however, only the 2D structure was proposed. Its stereochemistry was assigned using various spectroscopic techniques, including 1D and 2D NMR, and theoretical calculations of the NMR and ECD data. It was suggested that the less strained cyclic trimer with the (aR,aR,aR) configuration was formed atroposelectively in the cyclization process.

         <title>Amidoalkylation of Sulfonylheteroarenes with Alkylamides through a Radical Chain Mechanism</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct &#945;&#8208;heteroarylation of alkylamides through a radical chain mechanism involving homolytic aromatic substitution (HAS) was accomplished using methanesulfonylheteroarenes and t&#8208;BuON=NOt&#8208;Bu as arylating reagents and a tert&#8208;butoxy radical precursor, respectively.







Abstract
In the presence of a substoichiometric amount of a tert&#8208;butoxy radical precursor and a base, alkylamides were found to be heteroarylated at their &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds with sulfonylheteroarenes through homolytic aromatic substitution, where a radical chain is operative.

         <title>Structural Diversity using Hyp &#8220;Customizable Units&#8221;: Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept Synthesis of Sansalvamide&#8208;Related Antitumoral Peptides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The potential of &#8220;  customizable units  &#8221; to generate structural diversity for biological screenings is highlighted in this  proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept  synthesis of new peptides related to the potent antitumoral Sansalvamide A. Using L&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyproline (Hyp) as customizable unit in a linear parent peptide, an improved procedure for selective peptide modification was developed. A divergent Hyp scission&#8208;reductive amination process was carried out, affording five linear peptides with cationic residues, and remarkably, a  N  &#8208;alkyl moiety that hindered rotation. After two steps (saponification and macrocyclization), sixteen differently  N1  &#8208;substituted linear and cyclic peptides were obtained. For the first time, the activity of the linear and cyclic compounds was compared. Not only some linear analogs, but also cyclic compounds with scarcely&#8208;studied cationic residues were active against MCF7 breast cancer line. Thus, structural diversity generated from customizable units can be valuable in drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>"On&#8208;resin" disulfide peptide synthesis with methyl 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinesulfenate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New methodologies for the construction of full peptide structures with all disulfide bonds on the resin are attractive for the development of solid phase peptide synthesis. Detailed reaction conditions for the on&#8208;resin disulfide bond formation have been investigated using a mild and chemically stable oxidizing reagent, methyl 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinesulfenate (Npys&#8208;OMe). Monocyclic oxytocin, MCH and bicyclic &#945;&#8208;conotoxin ImI were synthesized in both semi&#8208;automated and full&#8208;automated protocols. It was found that on&#8208;resin intramolecular disulfide bond formation with Npys&#8208;OMe proceeds with the minimal formation of peptide oligomers by adopting a solvent system with 0.4 M LiCl/DMF. Crude peptides with complete disulfide bond patterns can be obtained in high purity in both protocols. This minimized the RP&#8208;HPLC purification step and the desired peptides were obtained with better yields. To our knowledge, this is the first fully automated construction of a bicyclic disulfide peptide on resin with more than 50% purity in Fmoc&#8208;based SPPS. These results suggest that Npys&#8208;OMe is a useful reagent for the disulfide bond formation in automated protocols.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalytic Strategy: Rapid Synthesis of Spiro&#8208;Fused Heterocycles, Integrated with Four Pharmacophores&#8208;Succinimide, Pyrrolidine, Oxindole, and Trifluoromethyl Group</title>

         <dc:description>
A phase&#8208;transfer catalytic 1,3&#8208;dipolar [3+2] cycloaddition grants rapid generation of various trifluoromethyl spiro&#8208;fused[succinimide&#8208;pyrrolidine&#8208;oxindole]s that might be of great utility for drug discovery. The gram&#8208;scale reaction in conjunction with the derivatizations of the product demonstrate the synthetic potential of this methodology. The reaction mechanism is also discussed.







Abstract
An efficient and practical 1,3&#8208;dipolar [3+2] cycloaddition of N&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethylisatin ketimines and maleimides has been achieved through phase&#8208;transfer catalytic process by using the cheap quaternary ammonium salt as a catalyst. The strategy grants rapid generation of various complex trifluoromethyl spiro&#8208;fused[succinimide&#8208;pyrrolidine&#8208;oxindole]s in good yields and with excellent diastereoselectivities. The preparative&#8208;scale reaction in conjunction with the optimized Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling derivatizations of the product give prominence to application prospect of this methodology. The investigation on the reaction mechanism implies that the real catalyst in the cycloaddition might be tetrahexylammonium carbonate.

         <title>Mechanistic Vistas of Trivalent Nitrogen Compound Reduction by Samarium Diiodide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The affinity of Samarium(II) to coordinate with trivalent nitrogen leads to a pre&#8208;association complex prior to the electron transfer. This pre&#8208;association turns out to be extremely effective in terms of enhancing the rate of reduction of substrates with trivalent nitrogen in rather unprecedented mechanistic pathway. This minireview describes these intriguing findings.







Abstract
In trivalent nitrogen compounds, the nitrogen lone pair is highly amenable to bind to samarium iodide prior to electron transfer. As SmI2 is more azaphilic than oxophilic, its affinity to the nitrogen lone pair is more pronounced in aza substrates than in the analogous carbonyl compounds. The impact of this binding is very large in terms of reaction rate and at the same time gives rise to unique mechanistic phenomena, which include unusual kinetic rate orders, catalysis by quantum dots, and remote functionalization. Even reduction of nitriles was found to be affected by this coordination to SmI2. This review focuses on the reduction mechanisms of three groups of compounds: imines, azobenzene, and nitriles.

         <title>State of the Art of Bodipy&#8208;based Photocatalysts in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochemistry is a tremendous research field offering many synthetic possibilities to the chemists. Breakthroughs in this area have been notably driven by the implementation of new classes of photocatalysts. Within this context, Bodipy (Boron&#8208;dipyrromethene) dyes possess attractive chemical and physical features such as their modularity, strong absorption under visible light irradiation, good thermal and photochemical stabilities and high fluorescence quantum yields. As such, this class of compounds has found widespread applications in functionalized materials, biology, medicine or organic chemistry. From an organic&#8208;synthetic point of view, excited states of Bodipy dyes have been harnessed in electron and energy transfer reactions. This minireview collates the relevant literature on the applications of these catalysts in synthetic photochemistry and provides some perspectives of this research area.</dc:description>

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed [3+1+1] Annulation of Nitrones with Isocyanoacetates as an Approach to 1,4,5&#8208;Trisubstituted Imidazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silver&#8208;catalyzed protocol for [3+1+1] annulation of nitrones and isocyanoacetates is reported. The reaction is proposed to proceed through sequential [3+2] cycloaddition, ring&#8208;opening, cyclization&#8208;oxidation, and dealkylation, allowing access to a broad scope of valuable polysubstituted imidazoles in high yields.







Abstract
A silver&#8208;catalyzed protocol for [3+1+1] annulation of nitrones and isocyanoacetates is reported. The reaction is proposed to proceed through sequential [3+2] cycloaddition, ring&#8208;opening, cyclization&#8208;oxidation, and dealkylation, allowing access to a broad scope of valuable polysubstituted imidazoles in high yields.

         <title>Recent Developments in C&#8722;H functionalisation of Benzofurans and Benzothiophenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we summarise progress in benzofuran and benzothiophene C&#8722;H functionalisations over the past five years, including 1) alkylations, 2) arylations and heteroarylations, 3) carboxylations, carbamoylations and C&#8208;heteroatom bond formations and 4) cyclisations.







Abstract
Benzofurans and benzothiophenes are important pharmaceutical motifs, appearing in a broad range of small molecule therapeutic classes. Often overlooked by synthetic methodologists in favour reactions of the analogous indole bicyclic system, there is nevertheless a plurality of approaches to effecting benzofuran and benzothiophene C&#8722;H functionalisations. In this review, we summarise progress in this area over the past five years, including 1) alkylations, 2) arylations and heteroarylations, 3) carboxylations, carbamoylations, and C&#8208;heteroatom bond formations and 4) cyclisations.

         <title>An Insight into Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions on the Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane Scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of bridgehead substitutions on non&#8208;covalent interactions was investigated for seven BCP derivatives. The X&#8208;ray analyses show 3D&#8208;structures and a combination of non&#8208;covalent interactions including HB, XB, and CH&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;HC contacts. QTAIM analysis and MEP graphs show the presence of bond critical points and &#963;&#8208;holes.







Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) is studied extensively as a bioisosteric component of drugs. Not found in nature, this molecular unit approximates the distance of a para&#8208;disubstituted benzene which is replaced in medicines as a method of improving treatments. Predicting interactions of these drugs with specific active sites requires knowledge of the non&#8208;covalent interactions engaged by this subunit. Structure determinations and computational analysis (Hirshfeld analysis, 2D fingerprint plots, DFT) of seven BCP derivatives chosen to probe specific and directional interactions. X&#8208;ray analysis revealed the presence of various non&#8208;covalent interactions including I&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;I, I&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;N, N&#8722;H&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;O, C&#8722;H&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;O, and H&#8722;C&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;H&#8722;C contacts. The preference of halogen bonding (I&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;I or I&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;N) in BCP 1&#8211;4 strictly depends upon the electronic nature and angle between bridgehead substituents. The transannular distance in co&#8208;crystals 2 and 4 was longer as compared to monomers 1 and 3. Stronger N&#8722;H&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;O and weaker C&#8722;H&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;O contacts were observed for BCP 5 while the O&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;H interaction was a prominent contact for BCP 6. The presence of 3D BCP units prevented the &#960;&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;&#960; stacking between phenyl rings in 3, 4, and 7. The BCP skeleton was often rotationally averaged, indicating fewer interactions compared to bridgehead functional groups. Using DFT analysis, geometries were optimized and molecular electrostatic potentials were calculated on the BCP surfaces. These interaction profiles may be useful for designing BCP analogs of drugs.

         <title>Recent Advances on Catalytic Osmium&#8208;Free Olefin syn&#8208;Dihydroxylation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;Diols are valuable scaffolds for building a vast number of biologically active compounds and are also important synthetic intermediates in organic synthesis. This review focuses on a concise summary of the main metal&#8208;catalyzed methods of olefin syn&#8208;dihydroxylation developed over the past ten years to circumvent the use of osmium.






The syn&#8208;dihydroxylation of olefinic group is one of the most important synthetic transformations which leads to the controlled formation of syn&#8208;diol. Such 1,2&#8208;diol structure is integrated into more complex architectures and substantially participates in the development of biologically active molecules and other fine chemicals. This minireview describes recent evolution of this research field in the past decade, surveying osmium&#8208;free and more eco&#8208;compatible system and in particular the direct oxidation of olefins catalyzed by transition metal complexes.

         <title>Recent Advances in Tris&#8208;Primary Amine Based Organic Imine Cages and Related Amine Macrocycles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular integration of Tris&#8208;primary amine moiety and multiple aldehyde centers often leads to organic imine cages (OICs) and related amine macrocycles which demand commendable position in the field of material science and supramolecular chemistry. In this review we highlighted recent studies regarding the synthesis and special features of such OICs and their saturated counterparts.






Molecules bearing three primary amine groups are ubiquitous substances in various fields of synthetic chemistry. Some of them are commercially available and the rests are emerged from the designed protocols of synthetic chemists. It has been observed that such aliphatic as well as aromatic triamines are excellent precursors for the design and synthesis of various cage molecules of which organic imine cages (OICs) and related amine macrocycles belong to the category of special interest. These compounds possess unique architectures and already made their marks in the field of supramolecular chemistry, synthetic methodology, and material science. In this review we aimed to consider recent reports that highlighted the syntheses, special features, and applications of primary triamine based OICs and related amine macrocycles.

         <title>Syntheses and Applications of Spirocyclopropyl Oxindoles: A Decade Review</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spirocyclopropyl oxindole comprising spiro&#8208;fusion of 2&#8208;oxindole with cyclopropane unit is a versatile organic framework. The present review highlights the detailed chemistry of spirocyclopropyl oxindole core. Various synthetic approaches to afford spirocyclopropyl oxindoles have been discussed followed by their applications in ring&#8208;opening/expansion reactions.






Spirocyclopropyl oxindole represents an emerging framework by unique amalgamation of versatile 2&#8208;oxindole motif and highly strained cyclopropane unit. This scaffold is remarkable for its diverse medicinal and synthetic applications. The present review delivers a comprehensive overview of the strategies to afford spirocyclopropyl oxindoles and their potential synthetic transformations. The syntheses of spirocyclopropyl oxindoles have been described based on the type of precursors, including isatin, 3&#8208;alkenyl oxindole, diazooxindole, oxindole, and 3&#8208;chlorooxindole. Besides, the utility of different cyclopropanation reagents like sulfur ylide, MBH&#8208;carbonate, carbenoid, vinyl selenone, etc. have also been emphasized. Furthermore, various ring&#8208;expansion/opening reactions of spirocyclopropane oxindoles using dipolarophiles/nucleophiles have critically been illustrated.

The syntheses of spirocyclopropyl oxindoles have been described based on the type of precursors, including isatin, 3&#8208;alkenyl oxindole, diazooxindole, oxindole, and 3&#8208;chlorooxindole. Besides, the utility of different cyclopropanation reagents like sulfur ylide, MBH&#8208;carbonate, carbenoid, vinyl selenone, etc. have also been emphasized. Furthermore, various ring&#8208;expansion/opening reactions of spirocyclopropane oxindoles using dipolarophiles/nucleophiles have critically been illustrated.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Reaction of N,N&#8208;Disubstituted Polyfluoroalkanethioamides with Diazomethane: Entry to New Thiirane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4&#8208;dioxane derivatives are discussed.






New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between N,N&#8208;disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4&#8208;dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4&#8208;dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

         <title>Substituted Naphthols: Preparations, Applications, and Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted Naphthols are amongst some of the most important carbocycles in organic chemistry. This review focuses on a plethora of important routes to access such structures of high value. Emphasis on reactants employed, reaction types, and their mechanisms is examined.






Substituted naphthols (SNs) are an important class of chemical compounds present in many natural and synthetic products with biological and pharmaceutical activities. Moreover, the naphthol skeleton has been employed as a starting material for the development of drug molecules and natural products. Thus, different synthetic methods to access naphthol cores have been reported using diverse starting materials and chemical strategies. This review article describes literature on synthetic methodologies of substituted naphthols synthesized from alkynes, sulfur ylides, diazo substrates, alkenes/cyclopropenes, ketones/oxanorbenes/furans, amongst other key reactants.

         <title>Evolution of Strategies in Protecting&#8208;Group&#8208;Free Synthesis of Natural Products: A Recent Update</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article highlights the recently achieved efficient total syntheses of many natural products based on chiron, auxiliary, cascade, biomimetic and photocatalytic approaches, as well as protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free strategies, leading to overall economy and efficiency in synthesis.






The synthesis of complex natural products must be realized with high economy and efficiency, contributing largely to sustainable development in synthetic organic chemistry. The new strategies should adopt protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free approaches enabling step&#8208;economy and thereby enhancing efficiency. Various approaches based on chiral pool, auxiliary&#8208;based methods, cascade, biomimetic, enzymatic and photocatalytic used in total synthesis of natural products and following the PGF&#8208;criteria over the last two years (2018&#8211;2019) have been reviewed here. These should guide sustainable synthesis of natural products in the future.

         <title>Multigram Synthesis of Heterabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl Trifluoroborates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
  Multigram synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates relying on efficient 4&#8211;5&#8208;step reaction sequences is described. The title compounds was obtained in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield).
  
  
  
  
 
 
  An approach to the synthesis of oxa&#8208; and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan&#8208;1&#8208;yl trifluoroborates on a multigram scale was developed. Two synthetic strategies were evaluated: the first based on the lithiation&#8211;borylation of the corresponding 2&#8208;bromoallyl derivatives, and the other relying on regioselective hydroboration of the appropriate hetera&#8208;substituted enynes. The second method appeared to be more efficient in terms of scalability and substrate scope. Further steps included ring closing&#8208;metathesis, mild palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation with diazomethane, and reaction with KHF2 and furnished the title compounds in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10&#8211;41&#8201;% overall yield, 4&#8211;5 steps).

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;Sultams by One&#8208;Pot Reductive Cyclization of Cyanoalkylsulfonyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
  A multigram synthesis of spirocyclic &#947;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;sultams is reported, which are advanced building blocks for organic synthesis and drug discovery. The synthesis proceeds through a one&#8208;pot reductive cyclization of cyclic cyano sulfonyl fluorides.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  One&#8208;pot intramolecular cyclization of novel sp3&#8208;enriched cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluorides into spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;sultams is disclosed.

     alt="Synthesis of Spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;Sultams by One&#8208;Pot Reductive Cyclization of Cyanoalkylsulfonyl Fluorides"/&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A multigram synthesis of spirocyclic &#947;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;sultams is reported, which are advanced building blocks for organic synthesis and drug discovery. The synthesis proceeds through a one&#8208;pot reductive cyclization of cyclic cyano sulfonyl fluorides.
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One&#8208;pot intramolecular cyclization of novel sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;enriched cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluorides into spirocyclic &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;sultams is disclosed. The method relies on nitrile group reduction followed by sulfonylation of amino group thus formed upon mild conditions (NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, NiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&#183;&lt;/b&gt;6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in MeOH). Cyclization proceeds smoothly with considerable efficiency (48&#8211;84&#8201;%, 10 examples) on up to 30 g scale. The cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluoride intermediates can be obtained via S&#8208;nucleophilic substitution in &#946;&#8208;functionalized alkanenitriles or double alkylation of &#945;&#8208;alkylthioacetonitrile, followed by oxidative chlorination with Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and further reaction with KHF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The title mono&#8208; and bifunctional sultams are advanced sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;enriched building blocks for drug discovery and organic synthesis providing novel substitution patterns and frameworks mimicking saturated nitrogen heterocycles such as pyrrolidine/pyrrolidone.&lt;/p&gt;
