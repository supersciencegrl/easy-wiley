Using &#945;&#8208;bromo ketones and acetylenedicarboxylate as the respective reactive partners, the [5+1] and [5+2] cycloaddition reactions with isoquinolinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolates facilitate the construction of isoquinoline&#8208;fused thiazine and seven&#8208;membered N, S&#8208;heterocyclic frameworks under mild conditions. This cycloaddition approach exhibits exceptional substrate versatility and tolerance towards diverse functional groups.







Abstract
Two cycloaddition modes of isoquinolinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolates have been established. Upon choosing &#945;&#8208;bromo ketones as the counterpart, a range of isoquinoline&#8208;fused thiazines can be attained with yields ranging from moderate to excellent through a formal [5+1] reaction pathway, exhibiting remarkable substrate adaptability and resilience to diverse functional groups. Additionally, a library of unprecedented thiazepino[5,4&#8208;a]isoquinolines, a novel category of seven&#8208;membered heterocycles, has been synthesized via a [5+2] pathway utilizing acetylenedicarboxylate as the reactive component. Notably, this reaction process stands out for its exceptional 100&#8201;% atomic utilization efficiency.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C4,C5&#8208;Diarylation of Isoxazole&#8208;3&#8208;Carboxylate by Double C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conditions for the palladium&#8208;catalyzed C4,C5&#8208;diarylation of ethyl isoxazole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylate through double C&#8722;H bond activation are reported. This methodology, which employs commercially available substrates, an inexpensive base and an air&#8208;stable catalyst, provides simple one&#8208;pot access to a wide variety of C4,C5&#8208;diarylated isoxazoles, allowing straightforward tuning of their properties.







Abstract
The Pd&#8208;catalyzed C4&#8208;arylation of 3,5&#8208;disubstituted isoxazoles via C&#8722;H bond functionalization has been largely described. By contrast, the reactivity of isoxazoles in C&#8722;H bond functionalization with both unsubstituted C4 and C5 positions remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report on the reactivity in Pd&#8208;catalyzed double C&#8722;H bond arylation of an isoxazole with unsubstituted C4 and C5 positions. Conditions for the palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct C4,C5&#8208;diarylation of ethyl isoxazole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylate using aryl bromides as the aryl source are reported. This procedure tolerates several useful substituents on the aryl bromide such as nitrile, acetyl, formyl, benzoyl, alkoxycarbonyl, chloro, fluoro, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, cyanomethyl, tertbutyl and methoxy at para&#8208; and meta&#8208;positions. Conversely, with ortho&#8208;substituted aryl bromides, mixtures of mono&#8208; and di&#8208;arylated isoxazoles were generally obtained. This methodology provides a simple one pot access to a wide variety of C4,C5&#8208;diarylated isoxazoles from commercially available substrates allowing to modify easily their biological properties.

         <title>An Oxidative SNH Alkylamination of 5(6,7,8)&#8208;Nitroquinoline N&#8208;Oxides in Aqueous Dioxane Medium</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel approach to synthesize otherwise inaccessible 2&#8208;alkylaminoquinoline derivatives in moderate to excellent yields. The reaction is based on direct oxidative substitution of hydrogen and, unusually for a Chichibabin reaction, proceeds easily under mild conditions and in an aqueous environment. The synthesis is scalable. Some products were investigated for their antibacterial activity.







Abstract
A novel and efficient method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;alkylamino and 2&#8208;dialkylamino derivatives of N&#8208;oxides of 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, 7&#8208; and 8&#8208;nitroquinolines, which can potentially exhibit biological activity, as containing a pharmacophoric quinoline fragment, is described herein. The reactions of 5(6,7,8)&#8208;nitroquinoline N&#8208;oxides with various primary or secondary amines in the presence of potassium ferricyanide at in aqueous dioxane medium afforded the corresponding secondary and tertiary amines in moderate to excellent yields. This reaction is the first example of a Chichibabin reaction leading to the formation of 2&#8208;alkylaminoquinoline derivatives at position 2 under mild conditions. A study of the antibacterial activity of some products was carried out.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Multipath Compact Cyclophanes for Quantum Interference Studies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic model compounds with two parallel conductance paths are reported. Preliminary single molecule transport studies reflect the impact of substitution patterns of the different pathways. From a synthetic viewpoint interesting, the fragility of the thiophene model compounds required the consideration of alternative protection group strategies.







Abstract
To investigate interference phenomena and conductance properties in mechanically controlled break junctions (MCBJs), macrocycles 1 and 2 (BMCs: for BenzeneMacroCycles), containing a meta&#8208;substituted benzene moiety with solubilizing tert&#8208;butyl groups, as well as structures 3 and 4 (TMCs: for ThiopheneMacroCycles), featuring 2,5&#8208;connected 3,4&#8208;hexyl&#8208;thiophene corners, were synthesized. Macrocycles 1 and 2 respectively 3 and 4 differ in the positions of the acetyl&#8208;protected sulfur anchoring groups, which impacts both, the individual transport efficiency of their parallel electronic pathways and their overall molecular wire lengths. All macrocycles were synthesized based on a series of Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reactions. For 3 and 4, a 2&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridinyl)ethyl protecting group for the sulfur atoms was successful, while for macrocycles 1 and 2 the more common tert&#8208;butyl protecting group did the job. To our delight, proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept charge transport studies conducted in an MCBJ setup demonstrated the expected trends regarding improved conductance intensities for the TMCs compared to the BMCs. Furthermore, the corresponding molecular plateaus from the breaking experiments were in the expected length range of the S&#8722;S distances for all compounds. We also found that the overall conductance seems to follow a more complex transport mechanism than just the sum of contributions from both channels.

Chalcogen Bond. Presence of Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N or Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se chalcogen bonds are highlighted in the structurally innovative benzimidazole&#8208;fused cyclic selenazonium selenocyanates, cyclic selenazinium selenocyanates and the acyclic benzimidazolium analogs having two different types of selenocyanate units. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures of the compounds revealed the participation of both N and Se atoms of the SeCN counterions as ChB acceptors in building the Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N or Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se ChB interactions.







Abstract
The non&#8208;covalent interactions in molecules play important roles towards their applications in various aspects such as molecular recognition, catalysis, supramolecular chemistry, structural biology, pharmacology etc. Interestingly, among various non&#8208;bonding interactions, chalcogen bonding (ChB) has been extensively studied in different facets of crystal engineering over the last several years. The present study demonstrates the presence of Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N or Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se ChB in the benzimidazole&#8208;fused cyclic selenazonium selenocyanates (6&#8211;8), cyclic selenazinium selenocyanates (9&#8211;10) and the acyclic benzimidazolium analogs having two different types of selenocyanate units (11&#8211;12). The final organoselenium compounds were synthesized from benzimidazole in several steps in reasonably good yields. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures of the compounds revealed that both the N atom and Se atom of the negatively charged SeCN unit act as ChB acceptors in building the Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N or Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se ChB interactions along with the additional hydrogen bonding (HB) interactions. Moreover, the structural optimization and natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses were carried out using density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the natural charges on different Se centers and the strength of second&#8208;order perturbation energy (E2) for the ChB interactions. Finally, surface electrostatic potential (SEP) of the compounds was developed to visualize the formation of &#963;&#8208;holes.

         <title>Construction of Spiro Systems from Tetrathiafulvalene Derivatives by a Pinacol&#8208;Like Rearrangement</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pinacol&#8208;like rearrangement of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives was found to yield spiro compounds under mild conditions with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine oxide (TEMPO) as a key reagent. The influence of various substituents was examined, and the mechanism was analyzed in detail. The findings highlight the broad applicability and selectivity of this transformation, offering valuable insight for the design of new TTF&#8208;based molecules.







Abstract
An efficient and generalized pinacol&#8208;like rearrangement of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives has been achieved using 2, 2, 6, 6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine oxide (TEMPO) as a key reagent, in place of a traditional metal catalyst. Examination of numerous TTF derivatives demonstrates the reaction's exceptional tolerance to a variety of substituents, achieving an overall yield of up to 97&#8201;%. The optimization of reaction conditions and evaluation of reaction applicability were achieved by varying factors such as the first redox potentials (E11/2) of the substrate molecule, substituent type, substituent position, number of substituents, and structural symmetry. Additionally, the reaction mechanism was explored using isotopic labeling, real&#8208;time monitoring UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Specifically, TTF is oxidized to TTF+&#8901; by p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH&#8901;H2O). TTF+&#8901; subsequently reacts with TEMPO and H2O to form a pinacol&#8208;like intermediate, which undergoes a rearrangement to release a 2, 2, 6, 6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;ol (TEMPOH) molecule, forming the rearranged product as a hydrogenated cation, this intermediate undergoes deprotonation, leading to the formation of the final spiro product. This investigation led to the identification of a class of reactions for the efficient conversion of TTF derivatives into their spiro products via pinacol&#8208;like rearrangement reaction.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Axially Diaryl Aldehydes by Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Desymmetrization Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axially chiral biaryl aldehydes are esteemed as valuable precursors for the development of innovative chiral catalysts, playing a pivotal role across a broad spectrum of research disciplines.The synthesis of axially chiral biaryl aldehydes with various structural features has been developed by reacting biaryl dialdehyde with aromatic amine in the presence of chiral phosphoric acid (CPA). It shows excellent enantioselectivity, mild conditions and good compatibility with different functional groups. These structures serve as promising precursors for a range of subsequent chemical transformations and are likely to have potential applications in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral ligands or catalysts.







Abstract
Axially chiral biaryl aldehydes are precursors for the synthesis of axially chiral compounds and novel chiral catalysts of great interest, which play vital roles in extensive research fields. However, limited strategies exist for the efficient synthesis of axially chiral aldehydes, and the construction of structurally diverse axially chiral aldehydes remains challenging. Herein, a strategy is reported for the synthesis of biaryl axially chiral aldehydes with varying structures from biaryl dialdehydes and aromatic amines in the presence of a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst. This protocol features excellent enantioselectivity, mild conditions, and good functional&#8208;group tolerance.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;Oligomannurarates with Purported Anti&#8208;Alzheimer Activity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we develop an efficient approach to the chemical synthesis of well&#8208;defined &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;mannurarate di&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, hexa&#8208; and octasaccharides with purported anti&#8208;Alzheimer's activity, utilizing N&#8208;phenyl trifluoroacetimidate donors and thioglycoside acceptors for the stereoselective assembly of the desired &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;mannuronate linkages.







Abstract
Sodium oligomannate, a sophisticated mixture of acidic linear &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;oligomannurarate ranging from dimers to decamers with an average molecular weight of 670&#8764;880&#8197;Da, has gained conditional approval for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we develop an efficient approach to the chemical synthesis of well&#8208;defined &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;mannurarate di&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, hexa&#8208; and octasaccharides (1&#8211;4), utilizing N&#8208;phenyl trifluoroacetimidate donors and thioglycoside acceptors for the stereoselective assembly of the desired &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;mannuronate linkages. This approach features a straightforward protecting group strategy with only two types of protecting groups: tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) for the 4&#8208;OH at the non&#8208;reducing end and benzyl (Bn) for free hydroxyl and carboxylic acid moieties, thereby ensuring the stereoselective formation of the &#946;&#8208;mannosyl bonds and facilitating sequential transformation into the target &#946;&#8208;(1,4)&#8208;d&#8208;mannurarate oligosaccharides. The scalability of the present synthesis of these oligosaccharides paves the way for in&#8208;depth structure&#8208;activity relationship studies and pharmacological investigations of sodium oligomannates.

This approach features a straightforward protecting group strategy with only two types of protecting groups: &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) for the 4-OH at the non-reducing end and benzyl (Bn) for free hydroxyl and carboxylic acid moieties, thereby ensuring the stereoselective formation of the &#946;-mannosyl bonds and facilitating sequential transformation into the target &#946;-(1,4)-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-mannurarate oligosaccharides. The scalability of the present synthesis of these oligosaccharides paves the way for in-depth structure-activity relationship studies and pharmacological investigations of sodium oligomannates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Filling the Gap within 10&#8208;Membered Heteroenediynes: Thiaenediyne &#8211; An Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiaenediyne, as a member of the heteroenediynes fused to a benzothiophene core, was synthesized using the S&#8208;type Nicholas cyclization. NBO analysis was used to demonstrate the primary role of the heteroatom in an enediyne core for the reactivity of enediynes in the Bergman cyclization.







Abstract
The heteroatom nature in 10&#8208;membered enediynes plays a crucial role in tuning of their reactivity in the Bergman cyclization, which is a decisive factor for the biological activity of enediynes. Although benzothiophene&#8208;fused O&#8208; and N&#8208;enediynes have been identified as promising biological objects, the corresponding thiaenediyne remains unknown. To fill this gap, we synthesized the thiaanalog and studied it in both practical and theoretical terms. While the Nicholas reaction has proven to be an effective cyclization technique for the preparation of heteroenediynes, in the case of thiaenediyne it was accompanied by an unusual acid&#8208;promoted intramolecular cyclization, forming a thiepinium salt. The S&#8208;enediyne has reduced reactivity in the Bergman cyclization relative to the N&#8208; and O&#8208;enediynes, attributed to the diminished alkyne bending and extended cd&#8208;distance. The NBO analysis of the entire series, namely the evaluation of &#960;in/out(C2&#8208;CC)&#8594;&#963;*(C&#8722;X) hyperconjugation, revealed that the S atom in S&#8208;enediyne provides stronger stabilization of the initial compound than the N atom in N&#8208;enediyne, while exhibiting the weakest stabilization of the Bergman cyclization transition state. NICS values were employed to examine the change in aromaticity along the Bergman cyclization coordinate. This approach, in conjunction with the NBO analysis, provides a foundation for further rational design of unnatural enediynes.

         <title>NHC&#8208;Catalyzed, Microwave&#8208;Assisted and Base&#8208;Dependent Reactions of Substituted Cinnamaldehydes Towards &#947;&#8208;Lactones or Saturated Esters</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
10 NHCs were used as organocatalysts using microwacve irradiation and depending on the base used to generate the free carbene, &#947;&#8208;lactones or saturated esters were prepared from aryl&#8208;substituted cinnamaldehydes. Novel NHC hydrochloride salts and &#947;&#8208;lactones are reported together with the optimum reaction conditions and the broad scope of both reactions.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) generated from imidazolium, imidazopyridinium and imidazoquinolinium hydrochlorides in&#8197;situ using base and microwave irradiation were employed as organocatalysts to yield homoenolates from cinnamaldehyde and its aryl&#8208;substituted analogs. Depending on the catalytic base either &#947;&#8208;lactones were prepared when the strong base tBuOK was used or the corresponding saturated ethyl 3&#8208;aryl propionates were synthesized with the milder DIPEA base. Novel imidazopyridinium and imidazoquinolinium hydrochlorides were synthesized and were compared to commercially available NHCs IMes and IDip for their catalytic activity. The optimum reaction conditions were established using IMes and the broad scope of both reactions was investigated using the 4 most efficient NHCs.

         <title>Convergent Synthesis of Antitumor Aplysiatoxin Derivatives Based on a Combination of Ring&#8208;Closing and Cross Metathesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated a convergent synthesis of aplysiatoxin analogs based on a combination of ring&#8208;closing and cross metathesis. Synthetic analogs with different side chains revealed that a naphthol moiety did not improve binding to protein kinase C (PKC)&#8208;C1 domains, suggesting that the hydrogen bonding of the hydroxy group with the PKC&#8722;C1 domains may be more important than the CH/&#960; interaction.







Abstract
We investigated a convergent synthesis of aplysiatoxin analogs based on a combination of ring&#8208;closing and cross metathesis. The route provided four analogs (3&#8201;a&#8211;d) with different side chains to determine the CH/&#960; interaction with protein kinase C (PKC)&#8208;C1 domains. Biochemical evaluation revealed that a naphthol moiety did not improve binding to PKC&#8722;C1 domains, suggesting that the hydrogen bonding of the hydroxy group with the PKC&#8722;C1 domains may be more important than the CH/&#960; interaction.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, Spectral and Redox Properties of Phenoxazine Embedded Heteroporphyrins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenoxazine embedded heteroporphyrins containing one phenoxazine, two pyrroles and one heterocycle (furan, thiophene, selenophene or telluorophene) connected by four meso carbon atoms were synthesized, and their structure and electronic properties were compared with those of previously reported phenothiazine embedded heteroporphyrins.







Abstract
A series of phenoxazine embedded heteroporphyrins containing one phenoxazine, two pyrroles and one heterocycle, such as furan, thiophene, selenophene and telluorophene, connected by four meso carbon atoms were synthesized by condensing one equivalent of phenoxazine&#8208;based tripyrrane with one equivalent of the appropriate 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl&#8208;p&#8208;tolyl) heterocycle under acid&#8208;catalyzed conditions, and their structure, spectral and electrochemical properties were compared with those of previously reported phenothiazine embedded heteroporphyrins. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the phenoxazine embedded selenoporphyrin revealed that the selenophene ring, which is opposite the phenoxazine moiety, points outward from the macrocyclic core, and the phenoxazine unit deviated by an angle of 39.47&#176; from the mean plane defined by the four meso carbons atoms. The replacement of the phenothiazine unit in phenothiazine embedded heteroporphyrins with a phenoxazine unit led to significant alteration of the electronic properties of the macrocycles, as reflected in their spectral and electrochemical properties. The absorption spectra of phenoxazine embedded heteroporphyrins showed bathochromically shifted absorption bands, hypsochromically shifted fluorescence bands with decent quantum yields, more facile oxidation and more difficult reduction as compared to the corresponding phenothiazine embedded heteroporphyrins. DFT and TD&#8208;DFT studies were in support of the experimental observations.

         <title>Relative Stability and Basicity of Enamines from Aminocatalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relative stability of two series of enamines was examined using DFT (mainly M06&#8208;2X), MP2, and CCSD(T) calculations. A basicity scale for enamines derived from pyrrolidine and carbonyl compounds was then established. Another basicity scale was obtained for a second series of enamines, from propanal and various aminocatalysts.







Abstract
The relative thermodynamic stability of two series of enamines has been examined using DFT (mainly M06&#8208;2X), MP2, and CCSD(T) calculations, supplemented by 1H NMR spectroscopy in some cases. The basicity of enamines derived from pyrrolidine and various carbonyl compounds has been computationally compared in the gas phase and in water; the results indicate which enamines or iminium ions may predominate in nonpolar and polar acidic media when pyrrolidine and two or more carbonyl groups or carbonyl compounds are present in the reaction flask. The relative basicity of a second series of enamines, from propanal and chiral pyrrolidines or imidazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones, has also been investigated; this sheds light on the main intermediates that should be expected when two or more secondary amines are present in acid&#8208;catalyzed aldehyde reactions. Non&#8208;covalent interactions explain the stability of folded side&#8208;chain conformers of O&#8208;silylated prolinol enamines, according to the predictions of M06&#8211;2X, &#969;B97X&#8722;D, and B3LYP&#8722;D3 (but not B3LYP). The significant stability of iminium ions containing appropriate electron&#8208;donating atoms or groups accounts for the basicity of the corresponding enamines. These findings pave the way for the future development of dual aminocatalytic processes.

         <title>Tunable and Selective Transformation of Aromatic Thioether Enabled by Regulating Active Species Under Visible Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the effective regulation of active species, the controllable upgrading transformations of aryl alkyl sulfides under mild conditions have been achieved by a pyridinium photocatalyst, which are ROS&#8208;dominated aerobic oxidation and the chlorine radical&#8208;mediated C(sp3)&#8722;S bond cleavage, revealing the great potential of pyridinium molecules in photocatalytic field.







Abstract
Through effective regulation of active species in photocatalytic process, the oxidation or C(sp3)&#8722;S bond cleavage upgrading of widespread aryl alkyl sulfides under mild conditions was successfully achieved by using a pyridinium photocatalyst. Benefiting from the excellent redox ability of the photocatalyst, the electron transfer between the pyridinium molecule and the substrate, molecular oxygen, or counter&#8208;anion effectively promotes the conversion and upgrading of the substrate thioether. Among them, the efficient generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) enables the highly selective oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides under visible light and air atmosphere. More importantly, the chlorine radical (Cl&#8901;) generated by electron transfer, reported for the first time, contributes to the cleavage of C(sp3)&#8722;S bonds, achieving the transformation of aryl alkyl sulfides to disulfides. By harnessing the superior photocatalytic ability of pyridinium molecules, this work not only achieves the highly selective conversion of thioether by taming the active species in the photocatalytic process, but also sheds light on the untapped potential of chlorine radicals in the field of C(sp3)&#8722;S bond activation and cleavage.

         <title>Structural Modifications on Dopamine Molecules toward Polydopamine Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into the structural modifications of dopamine in the organic chemistry level to enhance polydopamine (PDA) coatings. By altering the catechol moiety and aliphatic amines, researchers aim to improve PDA's adhesive properties and expand its applicability across various surfaces. The study highlights the significance of these modifications in optimizing PDA for diverse applications.







Abstract
Polydopamine (PDA) is a synthetic material synthesized through the oxidative self&#8208;polymerization of dopamine under alkaline conditions. This material emulates the adhesive properties of mussel foot proteins, allowing the formation of robust and stable organic coatings on various surfaces. Researchers have attempted to identify and improve the surface&#8208;coating properties of PDA by incorporating additional organic functional groups. This review explores the structural modifications of dopamine molecules at the organic chemistry level, with a focus on changes in the catechol moiety and aliphatic amines, and examines their impact on the applications of PDA. The flexibility of these modifications underscores their importance for optimizing PDA coatings for a wide range of applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Highly Fluorescent Thiazole Fused Benzo[a] Carbazoles by Sunlight Driven Photocyclization of Indolylthiazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sunlight&#8208;driven, irreversible photocyclization reaction of indole&#8208;linked trisubstituted thiazoles has been reported for the synthesis of thiazole&#8208;fused benzo[a]carbazoles. The Key features of this method include the use of sun light as the source of energy, catalyst&#8208;free conditions and presence of medicinally important thiazole and carbazole moieties. Most of these synthesized products show very good fluorescence quantum yields.







Abstract
Herein we report for the first time a sunlight&#8208;driven, irreversible photocyclization reaction of indole&#8208;linked trisubstituted thiazoles, for the synthesis of highly fluorescent thiazole&#8208;fused benzo[a]carbazoles using a mixture of solvents (CH3CN: DMSO; 3&#8201;:&#8201;1). Ring opening of indole moiety was observed in the case of thiazole derivatives having 2&#8208;methyl indole substituents. Under similar reaction conditions, photocyclization of trisubstituted thiazoles having cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls in place of indole moiety also worked. This reaction provides products having two medicinally important moieties thiazole and benzocarbazoles. We have studied the photophysical properties of all the products and found that most of the synthesized products have very good fluorescence quantum yields.

         <dc:description>
A facile approach unfolding one&#8208;pot cyclization of chromone and coumarin amines bestowing valuable fused amino/imino thiazoles via thiocyanation using potassium thiocyanate under ambient conditions. This methodology emphasizes enaminone cyclization towards the fused heterocyclic frameworks.







Abstract
A rapid metal&#8208;free approach describing one&#8208;pot thiocyanation of chromone and coumarin enabling tandem cyclization via potassium thiocyanate as a sulfur surrogate was unveiled. Interestingly, this enaminone&#8208;mediated protocol facilitated straightforward access to medicinally significant 2&#8208;amino/imino thiazolo fused chromone and coumarin frameworks. This methodology provided good atom&#8208;economy, remarkable functional group tolerance, and scalability. Alongside establishing a wide substrate scope, it also provided a feasible scalability up to gram scale.

         <title>Tandem, Catalyst&#8208;Free C&#8208;C Synthesis of Nitriles from Aldehydes and Methyl Cyanoacetate with Sodium Hypophosphite</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Synthesis of Pyrazolo&#8208;Sulfonamide: Impact of Solvent on Nitro&#8208;Pyrazole Reactivity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a copper&#8208;catalyzed, solvent&#8208;dependent route for the rapid and efficient synthesis of N&#8208;pyrazolo&#8208;sulfonamides directly from nitro&#8208;pyrazole and sulfonyl hydrazide under microwave conditions. Solvent dependent reactivity and remarkable chemoslectivity are some of the key features of this method. Further utility of the process is demonstrated by the sulfaphenazole analogue and sulfonamide nucleoside synthesis.







Abstract
This study presents a copper&#8208;catalyzed, solvent&#8208;dependent method for the rapid and efficient synthesis of N&#8208;pyrazolo&#8208;sulfonamides directly from nitro&#8208;pyrazole and sulfonyl hydrazide under microwave conditions. The reaction exhibits notable solvent effects in pyrazole's reactivity. The ionic liquid DBU&#8208;AcOH triggered the reactivity of 4&#8208;nitro&#8208;pyrazole, whereas the reaction in PEG proceeded selectively at the 3&#8208; &amp; 5&#8208;positions of pyrazole. Key applications of this method include the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of pyrazolo&#8208;sulfonamide, sulfaphenazole analogue and sulfonamide nucleoside.

         <title>Developments in the Construction of Benzo[b]Thiophenes from 2&#8208;Alkynylthioanisoles by Electrophilic and Radical Cyclization Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzo[b]thiophene moieties are important skeletons which have been widely found in many natural products, pharmaceuticals, as well as functionalized materials. This review summarizes the developments in the construction of benzo[b]thiophene skeletons from 2&#8208;alkynylthioanisoles by electrophilic and radical cyclization reactions.







Abstract
Benzo[b]thiophene moieties are important skeletons which have been widely found in many natural products, pharmaceuticals, as well as functionalized materials. 2&#8208;Alkynylthioanisoles, a class of bifunctional compounds bearing methylthio and alkynyl groups, are easily accessible from Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira coupling between 2&#8208;halothioanisoles and terminal alkynes, which have been widely employed as synthons in the construction of benzo[b]thiophenes through an electrophilic or a radical pathway. This review summarizes the related developments with a particular focus on the reaction mechanism. We hope it will help in future research in this area and believe that with the discovery of new catalytic systems, the industrial synthesis of benzo[b]thiophenes from 2&#8208;alkynylthioanisoles will be achieved soon.

         <title>Syntheses and Properties of Two Isomeric Phenanthroacephenanthrylene Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described herein are the syntheses and properties of two phenanthroacephenanthrylene regioisomers as the new non&#8208;alternant cyclopenta&#8208;fused polyaromatic analogs of alternant dibenzoperylene polyaromatics.







Abstract
Cyclopenta&#8208;annulated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (CP&#8208;PAHs) are of significant interest due to their unique optoelectronic properties and applications in organic electronic devices. Phenanthroacephenanthrylene (PAP) isomers are CP&#8208;PAHs that have been rarely investigated, and only the [9,10&#8208;e]PAP isomer was explored to date. Herein, we report the syntheses, crystal structure and optoelectronic properties of two PAP isomers, 7&#8208;ethoxy[2,1&#8208;e]PAP 1 and 9&#8208;ethoxy[1,2&#8208;e]PAP 2. The structural isomers were synthesized in multi&#8208;steps, and structural elucidations were performed using NMR, mass, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, revealing planar backbone of the isomers. UV&#8208;visible absorption and fluorescence spectra of compound 1 were red&#8208;shifted than that of 2, suggesting smaller HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap which is further validated by DFT calculations that suggested the lowering of HOMO&#8211;LUMO spacing could be attributed to the greater destabilization of HOMO for 1.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches for the Construction of Chiral Aziridines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optically active aziridines represent an important class of rigid three&#8208;membered nitrogen&#8208;heterocyclics because they are privileged structural frameworks in biologically and pharmacologically relevant natural products. This review is to summarize complementary assembly of optically active aziridines in recent years, as well as their applications in the agrochemical and pharmaceutical industry.







Abstract
Optically active aziridines represent a pivotal class of rigid three&#8208;membered nitrogen&#8208;heterocyclic compounds found in natural products, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and functional motifs, which have demonstrated outstanding practicability as therapeutic molecular frameworks, versatile synthetic endpoints, and functional materials in both academic and industrial communities. Recent years have witnessed a broad spectrum of prominent breakthroughs in the field of chiral aziridines due to the aziridine&#8208;based rigid and three&#8208;dimensional pharmacophores, which have resulted in streamlining the drug discovery process. Over the past few decades, particular attention has been directed towards the strategically efficient, versatile, and practical assembly of optically active aziridines. These synthesis approaches have demonstrated great potential in the context of the construction of pharmaceutical molecules, biologically and pharmacologically relevant natural products, and functional materials. In this review, several synthetic strategies for the assembly of chiral aziridines are summarized, which could be divided into five categories: (1) Introduction; (2) Construction of optically active aziridines via reactions of olefines with nitrene sources; (3) Construction of optically active aziridines via reactions of imines with carbenes; (4) Construction of optically active aziridines via reaction of azirines; (5) Construction of optically active aziridines via intramolecular cyclization of amine derivatives.

         <title>The Catalytic Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Bromo Aryl Acetic Acids by Late&#8208;Stage Bromination</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boron&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;bromination of aryl acetic acids via an enediolate intermediate is presented. This method yields a variety of aryl acetic acids with yields ranging from 19&#8201;% to 65&#8201;%, including three examples of dibrominated products. Furthermore, the reaction can be scaled up to the gram scale, and several transformations of the resulting products have been performed.







Abstract
We report a catalytic late&#8208;stage bromination strategy for the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of aryl acetic acid. The aryl acetic acid was transformed into enediolate in the presence of an (AcO)4B2O with the combination of DBU, and consequently underwent an electrophilic bromination reaction with pyridinium tribromide. A wide range of &#945;&#8208;bromo aryl acetic acids were isolated in yields of 19&#8211;65&#8201;%. In addition, the reaction could be performed on a gram scale, and several transformations of the products were carried out.

         <title>Organocatalytic Atroposelective C&#8722;H Amination of Arenes with Indolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral N&#8208;arylindolines has been established via nucleophilic amination of arenes with 7&#8208;substituted indolines.







Abstract
An atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral N&#8208;arylindolines has been established by organocatalytic nucleophilic amination of arenes with 7&#8208;substituted indolines, providing a straightforward way to achieve the expected C&#8722;N atropisomers in good yields (up to 95&#8201;%) with good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 97&#8201;% ee) from readily available starting materials. Furthermore, axially chiral N&#8208;arylindole derivatives could be prepared upon oxidative aromatization of the corresponding N&#8208;arylindolines.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Domino Synthesis of Sulfone&#8208;Containing 1,3&#8208;Enynes from Simple Alkynes and Sulfonyl Iodides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and efficient method has been developed to access sulfone&#8208;containing 1,3&#8208;enynes through a palladium&#8208;catalyzed domino radical sulfonylation and alkynylation of simple alkynes.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed domino radical sulfonylation and alkynylation of simple alkynes has been developed for the rapid construction of privileged scaffolds containing sulfone and 1,3&#8208;enyne motifs. The reaction of sulfonyl iodide with simple alkynes proceeded smoothly under mild conditions to afford a variety of sulfone&#8208;containing 1,3&#8208;enynes in good yields and with excellent selectivities.

         <title>Chiral Secondary Phosphine Oxide Ligands in Asymmetric Ni&#8722;Al Bimetallic Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligands play a key role in asymmetric transition&#8208;metal catalysis. Among reported chiral ligands, readily available and air&#8208;stable phosphine oxide ligands are unique and have aroused wide interest, especially in Ni&#8722;Al bimetallic catalysis, since they can act as bifunctional ligands to ligate two metals for stronger bimetallic synergism, greatly enhancing reactivity and selectivity. Hence, in this mini review we will focus on phosphine oxides and their applications in asymmetric Ni&#8722;Al bimetallic catalysis.

         <dc:description>The unique reactivity and stability of enamides make them attractive reagents in organic synthesis.

         <title>On the Halogenation of Tyrosine N&#8208;Oxime Methyl Ester</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient syntheses of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and heterodihalogenated derivatives of tyrosine N&#8208;oxime methyl ester are reported. Monohalogenation with N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS), N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide (NCS) or N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS) was optimized by addition of acid to suppress dihalogenation, affording bromo, chloro, and iodo derivatives in 71%, 50&#8208;53%, and 78&#8208;80% yields, respectively. Homodihalogenation utilized a two&#8208;step, one&#8208;flask process via a spirocyclic intermediate, yielding dibromo, dichloro, and diiodo analogues, respectively (75&#8208;76%, 54&#8208;56%, 79&#8208;80%). This strategy was extended to synthesize heterodihalogenated bromochloro, bromoiodo, and chloroiodo derivatives from monohalogenated analogues (50&#8208;77%). Key to this approach was the formation of an oxidized spirocyclic intermediate using excess N&#8208;halosuccinimide, followed by Na&#8322;S&#8322;O&#8324; reduction. This method ensures complete conversion and simplifies purification. Nine halogenated building blocks were prepared. These methods provide practical access to versatile precursors for natural product synthesis and derivatization, offering potential for diverse synthetic applications including regioselective palladium&#8208;catalyzed couplings.</dc:description>

A mild radical two/three&#8208;component cascade cyclization of 2&#8208;amino aryl ethynes to access difluoroethyl or monofluoromethyl sulfonyl dioxodibenzothiazepines or dibenzazepines with good selectivity/substrate scopes.







Abstract
A photo&#8208;induced two/three&#8208;component radical difluoroethylation or monofluoromethyl sulfonylation of 2&#8208;amino aryl ethynes was smoothly finished, which gave a series of difluoroethyl or monofluoromethyl sulfonyl seven&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles. The two radical systems featured simple/mild reaction conditions, good substrate scopes, and excellent E/Z selectivity. In addition, various radical intermediates were successfully detected by HRMS to explore the reaction process. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and scaled&#8208;up experiments examined the product scaffold and application of this cyclization system.

         <title>Advances in Combined Asymmetric Catalysis of Transition Metal/Phase Transfer Catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advancements in asymmetric metal/phase&#8208;transfer catalyst combined catalysis for rapid and efficient synthesis of complex organic molecules with precise stereochemistry.







Abstract
Phase&#8208;transfer catalysts (PTCs) are chemical agents that facilitate the transfer of molecules or ions between different reaction phases, thereby accelerating heterogeneous reaction processes. Transition metal catalysts are renowned for their versatility in breaking inert chemical bonds and forming new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. Over the past two decades, integrating metal catalysts with phase&#8208;transfer catalysts has emerged as a highly valuable and adaptable strategy in modern organic synthesis. This combined catalytic approach highlights the enhanced synthetic capabilities and demonstrates the benefits of merging these two catalytic systems. This review provides an overview of recent advancements in asymmetric catalysis that utilize the synergy between metal and phase&#8208;transfer catalysts, focusing on their role in the rapid and efficient synthesis of complex organic molecules with precise stereochemistry.

         <title>Practicable Syntheses of Electroluminescent Ionic 2,2&#8242;&#8208;Bifluorenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroluminescent organic molecules have been proffered as the key to unlocking a new generation of light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells. The article describes our development of a practicable library synthesis of a class of electroluminescent materials with a bifluorene core. The approach is applicable to an array of related materials containing a photoluminescent core tethered to heteroaromatic salts by alkyl chains.







Abstract
The development of a practicable library synthesis of ionic 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bifluorenes is described that improves the safety and reduces waste associated with the ubiquitous method of preparing these and related electroluminescent compounds. Additionally, an X&#8208;ray crystal structure that reveals how triflate counterions can provide a second link between the alkylimidazolium subunits and the photoluminescent core is presented.

         <title>Photocatalytic Decarboxylative Fluoroalkylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal decarboxylation&#8211;fluoroalkylation method involving the coupling of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids with &#945;&#8208;CF3 alkyl bromides was developed by the use of dual nickel/photoredox catalysis. A wide variety of substrates bearing a diverse set of functional groups underwent the transformation to afford trifluoromethyl analogues of &#945;&#8208;methylated allylic compounds under very mild conditions.







Abstract
A decarboxylative fluoroalkylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acids was developed by the use of a dual nickel/photoredox catalysis system. The fluoroalkyl radicals are generated from &#945;&#8208;CF3 alkyl bromides by nickel&#8208;induced single electron transfer (SET) and are subsequently intercepted by a cinnamic acid to forge the targeted C&#8722;C bonds. A wide variety of substrates bearing a diverse set of functional groups were compatible with the mild reaction conditions (visible light, room temperature, cheap metal, no strong oxidant or reductant), thus affording trifluoromethyl analogues of &#945;&#8208;methylated allylic compounds.

         <title>Photocatalytic Regioselective Tandem Cyclization Protocol to Trifluoromethylated Pyrrolidones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective and environmentally friendly strategy for construction of the pyrrolinone skeleton by a cascade of 1,5&#8208;dienes with CF3SO2Na is developed. This reaction involves radical addition, 5&#8208;endo cyclization and subsequent deprotonation. This protocol employs an inexpensive trifluoromethylation reagent and exhibits excellent regioselectivity, as well as broad substrate scope.







Abstract
A new environmentally friendly and efficient strategy for preparing trifluoromethylated pyrrolidones has been developed. The process involves using visible light to induce radical cyclization of 1,5&#8208;dienes with CF3SO2Na, resulting in excellent regioselectivity. This method uses less expensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;store trifluoromethylation reagents, making it an attractive option. Additionally, the resulting trifluoromethylated pyrrolidones can be easily modified and preliminary mechanistic studies have been presented.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N,O&#8208;Doped aceanthrylenes are prepared by combination of selective SNAr reaction or Ullmann&#8208;coupling of phenols, followed by an intramolecular direct arylation. The aromatic behavior of the hitherto unknown heterocyclic scaffold has been further analyzed by NICS and NICS2BC calculations.







Abstract
N,O&#8208;doped aceanthrylenes have been synthesized for the first time via a selective SNAr reaction or Ullmann&#8208;coupling of phenols, followed by an intramolecular direct arylation. The reaction has been carefully optimized and permits the selective synthesis of N,O&#8208;doped aceanthrylenes in moderate to excellent yields and tolerate various functional groups.

         <title>Silyl Radical&#8208;Participated Silylfunctionalization of Alkenes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkenes and alkynes are readily available basic chemicals. Silyl radical&#8208;participated silylfunctionalization of alkenes or alkynes is an important pathway for synthesizing various functional organosilicon compounds. In this review, we mainly summarize the recent progresses on radical silylfunctionalization of alkenes and alkynes.







Abstract
Alkenes and alkynes are inexpensive and readily available basic chemicals. Silyl radical&#8208;participated silylation of alkenes and alkynes provides a powerful tool for the direct construction of organosilicon compounds. Compared to hydrosilylation reactions, silylfunctionalization reactions are more attractive and advantageous in building diverse organosilicon compounds, which has led to their becoming a research focus in organic synthesis. Herein, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in silyl radical&#8208;participated silylfunctionalization of alkenes and alkynes.

         <title>Switching the Stereopreference of TeSADH: Enabling Anti&#8208;Prelog Asymmetric Reduction of Aryl&#8208;Ring&#8208;Containing Ketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 42, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study focuses on the &#916;P84/A85G TeSADH, showing its ability to reduce prochiral ketones in anti&#8208;Prelog mode with high stereoselectivity. It emphasizes the role of P84 in changing TeSADH's stereopreference. The mutant has a wide substrate range, including those accepted by W110 mutants with opposite stereopreference. This opens opportunities for transformations like bienzymatic racemization and stereoinversion using enantiocomplementary mutants of TeSADH.







Abstract
The biocatalytic asymmetric reduction of prochiral ketones offers a promising approach for producing optically active secondary alcohols. Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) are enzymes that facilitate the reversible conversion of prochiral ketones into their corresponding optically active secondary alcohols, and thus are pivotal for this process. Most ADHs adhere to Prelog's rule in determining the stereopreference for the asymmetric reduction of prochiral ketones. This study focuses on the &#916;P84/A85G mutation of TeSADH, demonstrating its capability to reduce aryl&#8208;ring&#8208;containing ketones to their corresponding alcohols in anti&#8208;Prelog mode with high stereoselectivities. The study also highlights the crucial role of P84 in switching the stereopreference of TeSADH in the asymmetric reduction of aryl&#8208;ring&#8208;containing ketones. Furthermore, this mutant exhibits a broad substrate scope, including substrates accepted by the previously reported W110 mutants of TeSADH with opposite stereopreference. The ability to create mutants of the same enzyme with opposite stereopreferences presents intriguing opportunities for fascinating transformations, such as bienzymatic racemization, which can be utilized in dynamic kinetic resolution, and stereoinversion using two enantiocomplementary mutants of the same enzyme.

Tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amines have been used as scaffold for the study of metal organic&#8208;radical interactions using EPR.







Abstract
A new family of stable radical&#8208;containing polytopic ligands based on tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amines TPMA architecture and their corresponding metal complexes have been synthesized. These molecular systems offered the possibility to investigate how various spin carriers, such as the metal ion and the organic radical, influence their EPR properties mainly through the empirical ratio of peak heights d1/d. Moreover, it has been possible to analyze how different conformations of TEMPO radical units in the molecular skeleton affect the metallic system.

         <title>Stable Ditriflates of D&#8208;Glucose in the Synthesis of Iminosugars and Polyhydroxylated Pipecolic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 42, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthesis of the iminosugar DAB and a divergent synthesis of 1&#8208;dehydromannojirimycin (DMJ) and the corresponding pipecolic acid are reported. The key step consists of double nucleophilic displacements of a D&#8208;xylose ditriflate by benzyl carbazate and a D&#8208;glucose ditriflate by allyl amine, respectively. This is followed by hydrolysis and oxidation or reduction of the resulting bicyclic glycosides.







Abstract
A synthesis of the five membered iminosugar DAB and a divergent synthesis of the six membered iminosugar 1&#8208;dehydromannojirimycin (DMJ) and the corresponding sugar imino acid are reported. They involve double nucleophilic displacements of a D&#8208;xylose ditriflate by benzyl carbazate and a D&#8208;glucose ditriflate by allyl amine, respectively. They are followed by a similar protocol consisting of hydrolysis and oxidation or reduction of the resulting bicyclic glycosides. This allowed DMJ to be obtained from the cheap sugar D&#8208;glucose.

         <title>Saturated Heterocyclic Sulfamoyl Fluorides: Building Blocks for the SuFEx Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 42, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable and cost&#8208;effective procedure for the direct fluorosulfonylation of saturated (hetero)cyclic and functionalized amines using SO2F2 in basic media is reported. The obtained sp3&#8208;enriched sulfamoyl fluorides can be considered a new generation of building blocks for SuFEx chemistry: they participated in transformations tolerating the SO2F functionality and reactions at the sulfur atom with O&#8208;, N&#8208;, and C&#8208;nucleophiles.







Abstract
A scalable protocol for direct SO2F2&#8208;based fluorosulfonylation of saturated (hetero)cyclic and functionalized amines is reported. The method is cost&#8208;effective and applicable for multigram preparation of structurally diverse compounds, as illustrated by the synthesis of 58 building blocks decorated with common functional groups. A comparison of overall yields of products demonstrates the advantages of the present method over alternative approaches. The obtained functionalized sp3&#8208;enriched sulfamoyl fluorides can be considered a new generation of building blocks for SuFEx (sulfur fluoride exchange) chemistry. The synthetic utility of the synthesized building blocks was demonstrated by late&#8208;stage reactions tolerating the SO2F functionality as well as transformations to provide the corresponding sulfamide, sulfamate, and sulfonamide derivatives.

Continuous flow approaches for the synthesis of chiral spiropenicillanates from 6&#8208;alkylidenepenicillanates by phosphine&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of allenoates or 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition were developed. The methodology leads to high yields (up to 96&#8201;%) and offers a sustainable, scalable pathway for the synthesis of biologically active spiropenicillanates.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the development of a continuous flow approach to chiral spiropenicillanates with remarkable bioactive properties from 6&#8208;alkylidenepenicillanates through phosphine&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of allenoates or 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition with diphenyldiazomethane. Model reactions were carried out using simple alkenes, such as methyl vinyl ketone and N&#8208;substituted maleimides, leading to the corresponding products in excellent yields (up to 96&#8201;%). The [3+2] annulation reaction was subsequently extended to the reactivity of 6&#8208;alkylidenepenicillanates, a more complex 2&#960;&#8208;component with an exocyclic carbon&#8208;carbon double bond, allowing the synthesis of spirocyclic compounds. The 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions between 6&#8208;alkylidenepenicillanates and diphenyldiazomethane under continuous flow conditions gave the corresponding spiro&#8208;1&#8208;pyrazolinepenicillanates in high yields (up to 81&#8201;%). Thermal ring contraction, via N2 extrusion, of spiro&#8208;1&#8208;pyrazolinepenicillanates under continuous flow conditions led to spirocyclopropanepenicillanates in quantitative yields. The continuous flow proved to be an efficient methodology for the synthesis of spiropenicillanates and represents a more sustainable approach for the larger&#8208;scale synthesis of spiropenicillanates with relevant biological activity.

Abstract
An efficient I2&#8208;promoted Povarov multicomponent reaction for the synthesis of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biquinolines or N&#8208;heteroaromatic benzothiazole using 2&#8208;methylquinoline or 2&#8208;methylbenzo[d]thiazole, arylamines, and &#945;&#8208;ketoesters was developed. The methyl group of methyl aza&#8208;arenes incorporated in the Povarov reaction via an iodination/Kornblum oxidation sequence. This method was achieved through a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step process without the need for transition metals, demonstrating excellent scalability in synthesis.

         <dc:description>
A Convergent, thiol&#8208; and metal&#8208;free strategy for the synthesis of benzothiazine&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives were developed from readily available precursors such as aryl ketone, aromatic amine and elemental sulfur. This reaction involves the formation of two new C&#8722;S bonds and one new C&#8722;N bond in single step employing environmentally benign iodine as the catalyst. Photophysical properties like quantum yield, solid&#8208;state emission, solvatochromism, Aggregation Induced Emission were also explored. Moreover, HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap was calculated for few compounds which suggests the possibility of Intramolecular charge transfer.







Abstract
A convergent synthesis of 2H&#8208;benzo[b][1,4]thiazin&#8208;2&#8208;one was achieved via iodine&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction. This strategy involves the formation of two new C&#8722;S bonds and a C&#8722;N bond from the readily available precursors &#8208; aryl methyl ketones, p&#8208;anisidine, and elemental sulfur to generate the desired heterocycle in moderate to good yields. As the synthesized benzothiazine&#8208;2&#8208;ones are fluorescent under UV light, photophysical properties like solid&#8208;state emission, solvatochromism, Aggregation Induced Emission (AIE), and the relative quantum yields of the compounds were measured which proves them to be a potential candidate for the development of optoelectronic devices.

         <dc:description>
An efficient and convenient method is developed for the synthesis of 2&#8208;quinolinones from o&#8208;iodoanilines with acrylates or acrylic acids. The key to achieve the cyclization reaction is to utilize redox&#8208;neutral base. The reaction mechanism involving a Heck coupling intermediate is well investigated.







Abstract
A convenient and general method for the construction of 2&#8208;quinolinones was developed in this paper. The Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction of various o&#8208;iodoanilines with acrylates or acrylic acids proceeded smoothly to produce 2&#8208;quinolinones in 28&#8211;&gt;99&#8201;% yields. The key to achieve the cyclization reaction is to utilize suitable base, such as potassium pivalate and potassium acetate. Various synthetically useful functional groups, such as halogen atoms, methoxycarbonyl, and nitro groups, remained intact during the reaction. The effects of catalyst and base on this cyclization reaction and kinetic experiments were investigated to understand the aspect of the reaction.

Abstract
Herein, we have demonstrated a palladium&#8208;catalyzed &#947;&#8208;alkenylation of unactivated alkenes with vinylcyclopropanes. A bidentate 8&#8208;aminoquinoline directing group was utilized for the regioselective &#947;&#8208;C(alkenyl)&#8722;H functionalization of unactivated alkenes with vinylcyclopropanes. This protocol exhibits wide substrate scope and good selectivity. Additionally, substrate diversification was performed to demonstrate the synthetic utility of the protocol. Mechanistic investigations were carried out to provide an insight to the reaction mechanism. A plausible mechanism was also proposed for the present methodology.

Isocoumarins by Ring Transformation: The cyanide catalyzed ring transformation of an &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoester is the key transformation for the preparation of an optically active isocoumarin derivative.







Abstract
A four step sequence for the preparation of optically active (R,R)&#8208;ethyl 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroisocoumarin&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylate is reported. In the first step the first stereocenter was installed by palladium catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition of PhB(OH)2 to indenone (88&#8201;% ee). After deprotonation, the ester moiety was introduced with Mander's reagent. The &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of the resulting &#946;&#8208;oxoester was then achieved with cerium&#8208;catalysis under an air atmosphere. Key transformation was the cyanide&#8208;catalyzed ring transformation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxoester furnishing the &#948;&#8208;lactone moiety of the target compound, which was formed as a mixture of separable cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;diastereoisomers, both with 88&#8201;% ee. The cis&#8208;isomer could be epimerized to the trans&#8208;compound. The relative trans and the absolute (R,R)&#8208;configuration of the target compound was established by X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analysis.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Tris(3&#8208;Pyrrolyl BODIPY) on 1, 3, 5&#8208;Triazine Scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 42, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY) and tris(BODIPY) on 1,3,5&#8208;triazine scaffold were synthesized over a sequence of steps and our spectral and theoretical studies supported the presence of excitonic interactions between the fluorophores in tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY) whereas the tris(BODIPY) did not show such interactions.







Abstract
Tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY) on 1,3,5&#8208;triazine scaffold was synthesized over a sequence of steps starting from commercially available cyanuric chloride. The cyanuric chloride was reacted with p&#8208;hydroxy benzaldehyde to afford 1,3,5&#8208;triazine tris(p&#8208;oxybenzaldehyde) which was then reacted with excess pyrrole under acid catalyzed conditions to afford 1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;tris(meso&#8208;p&#8208;oxyphenyl dipyrromethane). Subsequent in&#8197;situ oxidation of this compound with DDQ to obtain tris(meso&#8208;oxyphenyldipyrromethene) which was then treated with pyrrole followed by the addition of Et3N/BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 afforded fluorescent tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY). For comparison, tris(BODIPY) on the triazine scaffold was prepared by oxidizing tris(meso&#8208;oxyphenyldipyrromethane) with DDQ followed by complexation with BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2. Both compounds were thoroughly characterized and studied by various experimental and theoretical methods. Absorption, steady state fluorescence, time&#8208;resolved fluorescence, and transient&#8208;absorption studies revealed that in tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY), excitonic interactions between two of the three 3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY units resulted in a hypsochromic shift in spectral bands, reducing the quantum yield and singlet state lifetime whereas tris(BODIPY) did not show such excitonic interactions. DFT studies helped in understanding the excitonic interactions in tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY). The tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY) was fluorescent both in solution and solid state. The viscosity studies indicated that the fluorescence of tris(3&#8208;pyrrolyl BODIPY) increases significantly with solvent viscosity, suggesting its potential for measuring cellular viscosity during physiological processes.

The continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of spirocyclopropanepenicillanates through thermal ring contraction of spiro&#8208;1&#8208;pyrazolinepenicillanates was also included in the study. The reported methodology is a more sustainable approach for the scale&#8208;up production of compounds with significant biological properties in high yields.

         <title>Organometallic&#8208;Free Approches to the Direct Arylation of Benzoquinones and Naphthoquinones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 42, November 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arylquinones are present in many natural and synthetic molecules. They open up possibilities for application in various areas such as pigments and dyes, optical materials, sensors, pharmaceuticals, etc. Many of the methods to obtain them involve indirect arylation routes of precursors and a chemistry of oxidations, reductions, protection and deprotection of functional groups. In this review, direct arylation methods of quinones are compiled with a focus on processes where no C&#8208;metal bonds are formed, i.&#8201;e., organometallic&#8208;free reactions.







Abstract
Quinones represent a ubiquitous class of natural products, extensively distributed throughout nature. Within these organisms, they fulfil pivotal roles across a spectrum of metabolic processes essential to the organisms. Their privileged core structure is present in a variety of substances explored in medicinal chemistry. Modification of the central core of quinones could give rise to new substances with great potential as drug candidates. In this context, the introduction of an aryl or heteroaryl moiety on the quinone structure can be an important strategy for the development of new potentially bioactive compounds. In the present work, direct arylation methods of quinones reported in the literature are summarized, restricting the text to methods where organometallics are not used as catalysts, nor are organometallic species formed during the catalytic cycle. Radical arylation methods are presented where diazonium salts, hydrazines and arylboronic acids are used as aryl radicals&#8217; sources, thermally and photochemically generated. Polar reactions are also presented, that is, through nucleophiles and electrophiles. In most reports, rich aromatics acts as nucleophiles against naphthoquinones, whose electrophilicity is increased by an Br&#246;nsted or Lewis acid. Quinones can be the starting materials or generated in&#8197;situ from phenolic precursors.

         <dc:description>
The present study discloses an efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced &#960;&#8208;extension of perylene tetraesters, which proceeds by only irradiating blue LED. The synthetic research revealed the relationship between the regioselectivity and electron&#8208;donating/withdrawing effects of the substituents on the aromatic groups. Moreover, theoretical investigation suggested the importance of the bond alteration in the aromatic rings to determine the regioselectivity







Abstract
The present study discloses a highly efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced &#960;&#8208;extension of perylene tetraesters and discussion on the regioselectivity in the photocyclization. We initially found that &#960;&#8208;extension reaction of 3,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl perylene tetraester smoothly proceeded by only irradiating blue LED with a complete regioselectivity. Investigations of the photocyclization with various substrates revealed the relationship between the regioselectivity and electron&#8208;donating/withdrawing effects of the substituents on the aromatic groups.

&lt;p&gt;The present study discloses an efficient visible-light-induced &#960;-extension of perylene tetraesters, which proceeds by only irradiating blue LED. The synthetic research revealed the relationship between the regioselectivity and electron-donating/withdrawing effects of the substituents on the aromatic groups. Moreover, theoretical investigation suggested the importance of the bond alteration in the aromatic rings to determine the regioselectivity

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present study discloses a highly efficient visible-light-induced &#960;-extension of perylene tetraesters and discussion on the regioselectivity in the photocyclization. We initially found that &#960;-extension reaction of 3,4-dimethoxyphenyl perylene tetraester smoothly proceeded by only irradiating blue LED with a complete regioselectivity. Investigations of the photocyclization with various substrates revealed the relationship between the regioselectivity and electron-donating/withdrawing effects of the substituents on the aromatic groups. Moreover, theoretical investigation suggested the importance of bond alteration in the aromatic groups: cyclization proceeds preferentially at shorter C&#8722;C bonds with higher double bond characters. The findings will open new possibilities for the practical synthesis of custom-designed &#960;-extended perylene materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Computation&#8208;Guided Scope Exploration of a Conjugate Addition/Truce&#8208;Smiles Cascade Reaction for Scaffold Diversification</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explored variations of a conjugate addition/Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement/elimination cascade reaction that proceeds through spiro, bridged, or alternatively fused intermediates. None of these cascade substrates was found to undergo the desired cascade reaction. DFT calculations revealed that the Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement is the rate&#8208;limiting step for these processes. Based on these findings, we designed an alternative substrate that does undergo the cascade reaction, albeit with a different outcome.







Abstract
Based on the successful application of a nitroaryl transfer cascade reaction in the total synthesis of various monoterpene indole alkaloids proceeding via fused bicyclic intermediate, we investigated analogous cascade reactions involving spiro, bridged, and alternatively fused bicyclic intermediates. Unfortunately, none of these was found to afford the desired nitroaryl transfer product. DFT studies of the original cascade process revealed that the Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement is the rate&#8208;determining step. In addition, we found that the subsequent SO2 extrusion is accompanied by retro&#8208;Mannich ring opening, resulting in a stabilized enolate that only recyclizes after activation of the cyclic imine moiety. Computation of the reaction profiles of the proposed alternative cascade reactions showed that the barrier for the Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement is unreasonably high for the bridged and alternatively fused systems, but only moderately higher for the five&#8208;membered spiro system. Reasoning that even more electron&#8208;deficient arenesulfonamides should have a lower barrier for the Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement, we synthesized the corresponding 2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzenesulfonamide precursor and found that it indeed smoothly undergoes the nitroaryl transfer cascade at room temperature. In this case, however, the cascade reaction produces a cyclic imine product, as the intermediate 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenyl&#8208;substituted enolate is insufficiently nucleophilic to undergo the Mannich cyclization.

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;(Pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanyl)acetamides and Impact of the Fluorinated Group on the Lipophilicity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic approach to 2&#8208;(pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanyl)acetamides was developed using an amidation reaction between 2&#8208;(pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanyl)acetic acid and various amines. A 2&#8208;(pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanyl)acetamide could be transformed into two additional SF5&#8208;containing building blocks, a N&#8208;(2&#8208;SF5&#8208;ethyl)amine and an oxadiazoles. Finally, the effect of the SF5 substituent on the lipophilicity of the amide of a model compound was evaluated.







Abstract
The synthesis of 2&#8208;(pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanyl)acetamides is described via an amidation reaction between 2&#8208;(pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanyl)acetic acid, the SF5&#8208;containing building block, and various amines. A total of 27 examples of SF5&#8208;containing amides were synthesized, with isolated yields going from 43&#8201;% to quantitative. We showed that a 2&#8208;(pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanyl)acetamide could be converted to a N&#8208;(2&#8208;SF5&#8208;ethyl)amine and a SF5&#8208;containing oxadiazoles.

         <title>Xanthone Synthesis through Catalysis: Exploring the Green Limits of Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Methods</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transition from traditional stoichiometric methods to catalytic processes has significantly advanced the synthesis of xanthones, privileged structures with diverse biological activities. This review critically examines various homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic methodologies, emphasising their efficiency, and adherence to green chemistry principles. Through comparative analysis of key metrics such as Reaction Mass Efficiency (RME), Process Mass Intensity (PMI), E&#8208;factor, and Turnover Number (TON), we highlight the superior performance of heterogeneous catalysts, which demonstrate high reusability, selectivity, and minimal waste generation. The choice of solvent, a crucial factor in the environmental footprint of these processes, is also assessed, focusing on greener alternatives. The robust nature and economic viability of heterogeneous catalysts make them ideal for large&#8208;scale applications, offering suitable solutions for more environmentally&#8208;friendly xanthone production. Furthermore, the reduction in byproducts and the importance of catalyst purity in pharmaceutical applications are discussed, underscoring the relevance of these advancements in meeting the rigorous standards of the industry. This review provides valuable insights into the ongoing evolution of catalytic strategies in xanthone synthesis, driving future developments in medicinal chemistry and green chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect&#8208;Directed Synthesis of a Dithioacetal Tyrosinase Inhibitor</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes the combination of dithioacetal chemistry, thin&#8208;layer chromatography, and in&#8197;situ enzyme activity measurement to generate and identify, on a low milligram scale, a potent yet simple and easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare nanomolar dithioacetal inhibitor of the enzyme tyrosinase.







Abstract
Traditional methods for discovering bioactive compounds can be time&#8208;consuming and resource&#8208;intensive, often requiring extensive synthesis and evaluation. To address these challenges, this study combines TLC&#8208;based assays with dithioacetal mixture&#8208;library preparation, enabling rapid and effective bioactivity screening. Tyrosinase, an enzyme crucial for melanin production and fruit browning, serves as a significant therapeutic target in this context. Despite the substantial potential of sulfur&#8208;containing compounds in medicinal chemistry, the use of dithioacetals in drug discovery remains limited. In this study, two small libraries of dithioacetals, comprising more than 150 compounds, were prepared as mixture&#8208;libraries and screened on TLC by directly measuring tyrosinase activity on the plate surface. This approach facilitated the efficient preparation and identification of a potent, simple, and readily accessible dithioacetal inhibitor of tyrosinase, with the entire process being conducted on a low milligram scale.

         <title>A Squaramide&#8208;Tagged Proline&#8208;Mediated Direct Asymmetric Aldol Addition in the Presence of Water</title>

         <dc:description>
trans&#8208;4&#8208;squaramide&#8208;tagged proline 2 mediated a direct asymmetric aldol addition in the presence of water. In a departure from results observed with previous catalysts of similar design, 2 proved more efficient to its cis&#8208;counterpart, suggesting factors other than hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions at play. The catalyst also mediated an asymmetric desymmetrization of 4&#8208;alkyl cyclohexanones by the same transformation.







Abstract
A squaramide moiety introduced at the C&#8208;4 position of proline produced an organocatalyst that promoted the direct asymmetric aldol addition in the presence of water. A variety of aldol adducts, majorly from the reaction cyclohexanone with aldehydes, were obtained in yields generally in the range of 53&#8211;99&#8201;%, accompanied by 71&#8211;99&#8201;% ee and 83&#8201;:&#8201;17 to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 diastereomeric ratios. An asymmetric desymmetrization of 4&#8208;alkyl cyclohexanones was also achieved using the transformation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A squaramide moiety introduced at the C-4 position of proline produced an organocatalyst that promoted the direct asymmetric aldol addition in the presence of water. A variety of aldol adducts, majorly from the reaction cyclohexanone with aldehydes, were obtained in yields generally in the range of 53&#8211;99&#8201;%, accompanied by 71&#8211;99&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt; and 83&#8201;:&#8201;17 to &amp;gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 diastereomeric ratios. An asymmetric desymmetrization of 4-alkyl cyclohexanones was also achieved using the transformation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organocatalytic Applications of Sulfonyl Squaramides in Anion&#8208;Recognition Strategies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Appealing, highly acidic N&#8208;sulfonyl squaramides have been designed and synthesized. This versatile architecture provided an excellent catalytic activity in anion&#8208;recognition strategies, as illustrated in the multicomponent dearomatization of 2&#8208;picoline with silyl ketene acetals and Friedel&#8208;Crafts tritylation of N&#8208;methylindole.







Abstract
A modular, 3&#8208;steps protocol for the synthesis of N&#8208;sulfonyl squaramides has been developed. The strategic installation of a tetrahedral, electron&#8208;withdrawing sulfonyl group into the squaramido core allowed the prevention of undesired self&#8208;aggregations, therefore upgrading the solubility in common organic solvents, and moreover, enhancing their H&#8208;bond donor abilities for molecular recognition. These unique features have been efficiently exploited in two different ion&#8208;pairing reactions: (i) the challenging C4&#8208;selective dearomatization of 2&#8208;picoline with silyl ketene acetals and (ii) the tritylation of N&#8208;methylindole. Furthermore, their catalytic activities have been directly compared with other common and well&#8208;established (thio)urea analogues and related H&#8208;bond donors, revealing that highly acidic designs are essential to reach optimal catalytic performances.

The dienyl sulfones and &#946;&#8208;chlorosulfones are prepared under base&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions. The developed method displays excellent regioselectivity, mild reaction conditions and compatibility with various functional groups.







Abstract
This work reports a Cu&#8208;catalyzed coupling technique for synthesizing (E)&#8208;dienyl sulfones and &#946;&#8208;chlorosulfones from 1&#8208;arylbutadienes and styrenes, respectively. By employing easily available and inexpensive reagents, this method enables the synthesis of a diverse array of dienyl sulfones and &#946;&#8208;chlorosulfones with excellent functional group tolerance under base&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions. It also proves versatile for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug molecules and the scale&#8208;up reactions. The method showcases notable selectivity, gentle reaction conditions, and compatibility with various functional groups as demonstrated through 66 examples with excellent display of regioselectivity.

         <title>Heteroarylation of Organophosphonium Salts with Indoles in Water: Synthesis of Symmetrical and Unsymmetrical 3,3&#8242;&#8208;Bisindolylmethane Derivatives.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free method for the synthesis of symmetrical and unsymmetrical 3,3&#8242;&#8208;bis(indolyl)methanes has been developed through the direct heteroarylation of indolyl&#8208;containing di(hetero)aryl phosphonium salts with indole derivatives in aqueous media.







Abstract
A method for the synthesis of symmetrical and unsymmetrical 3,3&#8242;&#8208;bis(indolyl)methanes (3,3&#8242;&#8208;BIMs) has been developed through the direct heteroarylation of indolyl&#8208;containing di(hetero)aryl phosphonium salts with indole derivatives in aqueous media. This metal&#8208;free reaction proceeds smoothly under mild conditions, eliminating the need for hazardous solvents and expensive additives/catalysts typically used in conventional synthesis routes, thereby highlighting the synthetic practicality and efficiency of the process. The success of this approach is largely attributed to the role of water as a promoter, facilitating the C&#8722;P bond functionalization of the phosphonium salts. Furthermore, the reaction demonstrates a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and excellent scalability. Moreover, the protocol can also be extended to the synthesis of triindolylmethane compound and diarylmethylated indole.

         <title>Photoactivated Formal [3 + 2]/[4+2] Cycloaddition of N&#8208;Aryl Cyclopropyl and Cyclobutylamines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Presented here is a visible light&#8208;mediated formal cycloaddition reaction of cyclopropylamines with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl systems. Driven by strained ring systems, this reaction facilitates the synthesis of diverse cycloaminoalkyl scaffolds. The study unveils two distinct mechanistic pathways: the [3+2] cycloaddition, guided by the photochemical activity of an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex and the [4+2] annulation of cyclobutylanilines facilitated by photoredox catalysis.







Abstract
Organic transformations initiated by photochemical activation have been at the forefront of reaction discovery. In this study, we present a formal photochemical [3+2] and [4+2] cycloaddition using N&#8208;aryl cyclopropylamines and N&#8208;aryl cyclobutylamines in conjunction with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl systems, unveiling two distinct mechanistic pathways. The [3+2] cycloaddition is elucidated as being guided by the photochemical activity of an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex. Simultaneously, intermolecular [4+2] annulation of cyclobutylanilines is achieved by visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis. These simple methodologies have wide applicability, facilitating the synthesis of N&#8208;arylaminocycloalkyl compounds in yields ranging from good to excellent.

         <title>Iodoaniline Dependent Formation of N&#8208;Aroylguanidines Versus 2&#8208;Aminoquinazolinones from Palladium(0) Catalysed Aminocarbonylation of N&#8208;Arylguanidines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Arylguanidines upon Pd&#8208;catalysed aminocarbonylation reaction involving aryl iodide, in&#8208;situ generated CO afforded the corresponding N&#8208;aroylguanidines exclusively or a mixture of two types of 2&#8208;aminoquinazolinones or one type of 2&#8208;aminoquinazolinone depending upon the substitution pattern in the substrates. The formation of either type of 2&#8208;aminoquinazolinone involves the C&#8722;N bond cleavage of N&#8208;aroylguanidines, a rare process witnessed in the guanidine chemistry.







Abstract
A family of N,N&#8242;&#8208;diaryl&#8208;N&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)guanidines (B) were prepared in 70&#8201;%&#8211;92&#8201;% yields and subjected to palladium(0) catalyzed aminocarbonylation reactions with aryl iodides using CsOH/CHCl3 mixture as CO surrogate to afford the corresponding N&#8208;aroylguanidines (C) in 70&#8201;%&#8211;93&#8201;% yields. A gram scale synthesis was reported for a representative example. When the aforementioned reaction was carried out with 2&#8208;iodoaniline as an electrophile, either a mixture of two distinct 2&#8208;aminoquinazolinones (D and E) or one of these 2&#8208;aminoquinazolinones are formed. The scope of guanidines and aryl iodides were explored for both of the above&#8208;mentioned reactions. The role of directing group in the substrates upon the successful aminocarbonylation of guanidines, B is outlined. The reactions of a pair of N&#8208;aroylguanidines, C with PhI(OAc)2 afforded 2&#8208;aminobenzimidazoles, T with unanticipated core. Plausible mechanisms of formation of C, D, E and T are outlined.

&lt;p&gt;A family of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&#8242;&lt;/i&gt;-diaryl-&lt;i&gt;N&#8242;&#8242;&lt;/i&gt;-(pyridine-2-ylmethyl)guanidines (&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;) were prepared in 70&#8201;%&#8211;92&#8201;% yields and subjected to palladium(0) catalyzed aminocarbonylation reactions with aryl iodides using CsOH/CHCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; mixture as CO surrogate to afford the corresponding &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-aroylguanidines (&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;) in 70&#8201;%&#8211;93&#8201;% yields. A gram scale synthesis was reported for a representative example. When the aforementioned reaction was carried out with 2-iodoaniline as an electrophile, either a mixture of two distinct 2-aminoquinazolinones (&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt;) or one of these 2-aminoquinazolinones are formed. The scope of guanidines and aryl iodides were explored for both of the above-mentioned reactions. The role of directing group in the substrates upon the successful aminocarbonylation of guanidines, &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; is outlined. The reactions of a pair of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-aroylguanidines, &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt; with PhI(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; afforded 2-aminobenzimidazoles, &lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt; with unanticipated core. Plausible mechanisms of formation of &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt; are outlined.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Perylene Based Twisted Emissive Curved Nanographene Synthesis through Scholl Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perylene&#8208;based twisted chiral nanographene (NG) consists of two [6] helices, synthesized by a highly regioselective Scholl cyclodehydrogenation reaction. The NG showed a photoluminescence quantum yield (&#981;f) of 55&#8201;%, indicating its great potential for chiral optoelectronics.







Abstract
A twisted chiral nanographene (NG) surrounded by eight bulky tert&#8208;butyl groups fused with emissive chromophore perylene was synthesized by highly regioselective cyclodehydrogenation strategy in which a double [6]helicene was formed simultaneously. The twisted 4&#8208;meso was unambiguously confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The NG showed an excellent photoluminescence quantum yield (&#981;f) of 55&#8201;%, indicating its great potential for chiral optoelectronics.

         <title>A Mechanistic Study of the Oxidation of Substituted Benzyl Alcohols with Trichloroisocyanuric Acid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism for the oxidation of substituted benzyl alcohols with TCCA was elucidated by kinetic measurements and DFT calculations. We found hydride abstraction by autocatalytic Cl2 as the determining step, while strongly electron withdrawing groups diverted the reaction course to hydrogen abstraction from the respective organic hypochlorite as a special case.







Abstract
A systematic mechanistic study employing rate constant (kobs) kinetics measurements, linear free&#8208;energy relationship, hydrogen kinetic isotope effect and rate law, as well as the Density Functional Theory (DFT) approach (M06&#8208;2x/6&#8208;311G(d,p)) for the oxidation of diverse substituted benzyl alcohols with trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA)/H2O in 50&#8201;% MeCN/CH2Cl2 at 25.0&#8201;&#176;C is present. The kinetic results showed an autocatalytic behavior and a primary kinetic isotope effect (4.22). The linear free&#8208;energy relationship (&#963;, &#961;=&#8722;1.22) indicated a mechanism change for 4&#8208;CF3, 3&#8208;NO2 and 4&#8208;NO2 substituted benzyl alcohols and a fractional rate law (3.25) for benzyl alcohol. The DFT results indicated Cl2, formed in&#8197;situ from TCCA and HCl. Furthermore, calculations support the kinetic results with high agreement through a transition state that performs a hydride abstraction by autocatalytic Cl2 in the induction zone. In the case of substrates bearing strong electron withdrawing groups, the mechanism changes to hydrogen abstraction from the corresponding benzyl hypochlorite as the main pathway.

         <title>Gilding the Lily: Studies on the Effects of Successive Loading of Light Energy&#8208;Storing Molecules with Norbornadiene Units</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small series of chromophores with an increasing number of norbornadiene units was synthesized. Comparison of the reversible photoisomerization reaction to the corresponding quadricyclanes revealed an optimal balance of photochemical properties for the tris&#8208;norbornadiene derivative.







Abstract
The photochromic norbornadiene&#8208;quadricyclane cycle has emerged as a promising basis for molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage. In this context, it has been established that multifunctional photoswitches with several norbornadiene units at one central aromatic core have favorable photochemical properties and storage capacities. Nevertheless, a maximum number of three norbornadiene units has been combined in one molecule, so far. In this work, scope and limits of this approach should be further assessed. Thus, exemplary polyfunctionalized derivatives have been synthesized by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions, and their suitability for MOST applications was investigated. These compounds were converted into the corresponding quadricyclanes by direct UV irradiation (&#955;ex=315&#8197;nm) with moderate quantum yields, whereas the reaction is more efficient upon irradiation with &#955;ex=520&#8197;nm in the presence of photosensitizers. But these molecules showed low stabilities and short half&#8208;lives of 1 to 2&#8197;days. Moreover, the photochemical reaction is hampered by the close vicinity of photoactive units. Therefore, it appears that in such assemblies, a maximum number of three norbornadiene units is the limit to keep the optimal balance of photochemical properties required for MOST applications.

         <title>Ruthenium Catalyzed Formation of Fused Pyridine Derivatives or Substituted Indoles from Hydrazine&#8208;Derived Enamines and Propargyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Annulated pyridines and substituted indoles are important scaffolds in medicinal and agricultural chemistry. These heterocyclic motifs are easily accessible from secondary propargyl alcohols and hydrazine derived enamines by ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions. The bifunctional ruthenium catalyst used is stable to air and moisture and is easily accessible in high yield from commercially available compounds.







Abstract
New ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed transformations of secondary propargyl alcohols with hydrazine&#8208;derived enamines are presented, affording fused pyridines or substituted indoles depending on the hydrazine derivative used. The cascade reactions are catalyzed by an air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable bifunctional ruthenium complex and proceed via redox&#8208;isomerization of the propargyl alcohol, subsequent Michael addition and cyclocondensation. In case of phenylhydrazine a Fischer indole synthesis also takes place, prior to the final release of the products. The produced heterocyclic motifs are important scaffolds in medicinal and agricultural chemistry.

         <title>S&#8208;Aryl Substitution Enhances Acidity of the 1,2,4&#8208;Triazolium Scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large series of novel N,N&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salts with 3&#8208;S&#8208;aryl substituents was prepared from neutral S&#8208;aryl triazole precursors. High protofugalities (kinetic acidities) were demonstrated for C(5)&#8208;H highlighting the acidifying effect of the distal C(3)&#8208;sulfur with mechanistic insight obtained from XRD&#8208;protofugality correlations.







Abstract
The 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium scaffold in asymmetric organocatalysis results in remarkable rate accelerations, with reactions typically occurring via N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) intermediates. Although the most acidic NHC pre&#8208;catalyst class, there remains scope for further increases in acidity particularly for aqueous organocatalysis applications. The acidity&#8208;enhancing effects of thio&#8208;substituents on carbon acidity are well&#8208;documented but not explored in the 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium scaffold. Herein, we report the synthesis of a large series of N, N&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;C(3)&#8208;S&#8208;aryltriazolium ions and quantitative kinetic evaluation of C(5)&#8208;H acidity. The direct attachment of S&#8208;aryl substituents to the triazolium heterocycle results in substantial increases in protofugalities (kinetic acidities) with second order rate constants (kDO) for C(5)&#8208;H deprotonation by DO&#8722; base that are 2.9&#8211;60.3 fold higher than for reference 1,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolium iodide in D2O solution. Protofugalities for the N, N&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;C(3)&#8208;S&#8208;aryltriazolium series are similar to commonly used bicyclic N&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolium organocatalysts despite having two electron donating N&#8208;alkyl substituents. This highlights the future potential of this NHC design which could enable the introduction of two chiral alkyl substituents close to the C(5) carbenic position with pre&#8208;catalyst acidity controlled by distal C(3)&#8208;S&#8208;aryl substitution. Detailed X&#8208;ray structural data&#8208;protofugality correlations enabled evaluation of the S&#8208;aryl substituent effect origins.

     alt="S-Aryl Substitution Enhances Acidity of the 1,2,4-Triazolium Scaffold"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large series of novel N,N-dialkyl-1,2,4-triazolium salts with 3-S-aryl substituents was prepared from neutral S-aryl triazole precursors. High protofugalities (kinetic acidities) were demonstrated for C(5)-H highlighting the acidifying effect of the distal C(3)-sulfur with mechanistic insight obtained from XRD-protofugality correlations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1,2,4-triazolium scaffold in asymmetric organocatalysis results in remarkable rate accelerations, with reactions typically occurring via &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) intermediates. Although the most acidic NHC pre-catalyst class, there remains scope for further increases in acidity particularly for aqueous organocatalysis applications. The acidity-enhancing effects of thio-substituents on carbon acidity are well-documented but not explored in the 1,2,4-triazolium scaffold. Herein, we report the synthesis of a large series of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-dialkyl-C(3)-&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-aryltriazolium ions and quantitative kinetic evaluation of C(5)-H acidity. The direct attachment of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-aryl substituents to the triazolium heterocycle results in substantial increases in protofugalities (kinetic acidities) with second order rate constants (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;DO&lt;/sub&gt;) for C(5)-H deprotonation by DO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; base that are 2.9&#8211;60.3 fold higher than for reference 1,4-dimethyl-1,2,4-triazolium iodide in D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O solution. Protofugalities for the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-dialkyl-C(3)-&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-aryltriazolium series are similar to commonly used bicyclic &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-aryl-1,2,4-triazolium organocatalysts despite having two electron donating &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkyl substituents. This highlights the future potential of this NHC design which could enable the introduction of two chiral alkyl substituents close to the C(5) carbenic position with pre-catalyst acidity controlled by distal C(3)-&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-aryl substitution. Detailed X-ray structural data-protofugality correlations enabled evaluation of the &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-aryl substituent effect origins. C(5)-H p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values (16.9&#8211;18.6) were calculated by utilisation of experimental protofugalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Elemental Sulfur Promoted Cyclization of o&#8208;Chloronitrobenzenes and Aryl Isothiocyanates to Furnish 2&#8208;Aminobenzothiazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of 2&#8208;aminobenzothiazoles from substituted nitroarenes is rare. Elemental sulfur has now been found to promote the cyclization of 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzenes and aryl isothiocyanates to give 2&#8208;aminobenzothiazoles with different useful functionalities in moderate to good yields. The method provides a convenient pathway to obtain these compounds, as the nitroarene precursors could be directly used without further reduction.







Abstract
Methods to afford 2&#8208;aminobenzothiazoles often involve the use of o&#8208;aminothiophenols or aniline&#8208;typed precursors. Herein we describe a method to furnish 2&#8208;aminobenzothiazoles through the cyclization of o&#8208;chloronitrobenzenes and aryl isothiocyanates with the assistance of elemental sulfur. From the perspective of step economy, our strategy allows for the direct use of nitroarene precursors without further reduction to anilines. The scope of the reaction with respect to both substrates was investigated, and it was found that electronic properties of the aryl isothiocyanate was important for obtaining acceptable yields.

Abstract
A binary mixture of organic salts, also known as ionic liquids, [C12mim][Br]:[MPIM][HCOO] denoted as BmIL1 has been explored as bifunctional catalyst for the selective synthesis of 2&#8208;phenylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones and 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinazolin&#8208;(1H)&#8208;ones from same precursors under metal, ligand and additive free conditions. The methodology has been extended to the synthesis of 2&#8208;phenylquinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones via another pathway from different precursors under the same catalytic system. Greener synthesis of existing drugs reestablished the multifunctionality of BmIL1. Gram scale synthesis of both the products, DFT calculations and sc&#8208;XRD data add significance to the developed protocol. Moreover, high atom economy and eco score values justify the sustainability of the methodology.

         <title>Activation of Alkenes via Chalcogen Bond: Chalcogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; Bond Catalyzed the Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction of 2&#8208;Vinylindoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study investigates the stepwise mechanism of the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 2&#8208;vinylindoles catalyzed by chalcogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bond. Furthermore, the activation of alkene through Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bond serves as an alternative strategy to drive this reaction. The reaction catalyzed by Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonds involves the endo and exo pathways, and the endo product is more easily obtained.







Abstract
Chalcogen bond catalysis is a promising catalytic strategy, characterized by its environmental friendliness, relatively inexpensive cost, and similar reactivity to transition metal catalysis. Experimental results suggest that the S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonds can efficiently drive the vinyl&#8208;indole&#8208;based Diels&#8208;Alder reaction (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2021, 60, 9395&#8211;9400). In this work, chalcogen bond catalysis in the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between 2&#8208;vinylindoles is investigated based on density functional theory. For this reaction, the Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bond catalysis is as an alternative catalytic strategy. The Diels&#8208;Alder reaction catalyzed by chalcogen bond is stepwise and involves two steps: the carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation process and the cyclization process. The cyclization process is the rate&#8208;determining step. From the perspective of energy decomposition analysis, the electrostatic interaction is the main factor to cause Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bond catalysis, the polarization interaction is the main factor to cause Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bond catalysis. Additionally, this catalytic reaction involves the endo pathway and exo pathway. The Gibbs free energy barrier values of the endo pathway are lower than those of the exo pathway, which facilitates the formation of the endo product. This study will provide a valuable perspective on the application of chalcogen bond in the activation of alkenes.

         <title>Synthesis of the cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;3&#8208;Fluoro Analogues of Febrifugine and Halofuginone</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Febrifugine and isofebrifugine have attracted interest from a structural and biological perspective. In this work, the cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;3&#8208;fluoropiperidine analogues of these natural products have been prepared following a five&#8208;step route featuring electrophilic enamine fluorination, Sakurai&#8208;type allylation and functional group manipulation of the 2&#8208;allyl substituent. In their free&#8208;base forms the interconversion of these diastereomers has been studied at different temperatures by NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
The novel synthesis of racemic cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;3&#8208;fluorofebrifugine and halofuginone is described. This straight&#8208;forward seven&#8208;step process relies on an electrophilic fluorination&#8208;allylation sequence that generates a mixture of N&#8208;Cbz protected, diastereomeric 2&#8208;allyl&#8208;3&#8208;fluoropiperidines. On separation, a Wacker oxidation&#8208;methyl functionalisation sequence enabled introduction of the required quinazolinone portion. Finally, removal of the N&#8208;Cbz protecting group lead to isolation of the 3&#8208;fluorofebrifugine dihydrobromide analogues that are of potentially pharmacological use. Analysis of the NMR spectra for each stereoisomer provides information concerning the preferred conformers of the different diastereomers. Evidence indicates that the cis&#8208;diastereomer favours a conformation where the F&#8208;atom occupies an axial orientation. In contrast, for its trans&#8208;stereoisomeric counterpart, the 2&#8208;substituent overrides any F&#8208;atom effect and it preferentially occupies a conformer where both substituents occupy equatorial positions. Finally, interconversion between the cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;diastereomers was studied. In DMSO&#8208;d6 and as their free&#8208;bases, isomerisation of each diastereomer gave a common 65&#8201;:&#8201;35 ratio of trans&#8208; to cis&#8208;3&#8208;fluorofebrifugine. Determination of the reaction rate constants for the isomerisation process at different temperatures enabled calculation of the activation energy barriers, for each process, using an Arrhenius plot. The activation energy barrier for the isomerisation of the trans&#8208;isomer was 94.3&#177;4.9&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, whereas for the cis&#8208;isomer it was 84.5&#177;3.9&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

In this work, the cis- and trans-3-fluoropiperidine analogues of these natural products have been prepared following a five-step route featuring electrophilic enamine fluorination, Sakurai-type allylation and functional group manipulation of the 2-allyl substituent. In their free-base forms the interconversion of these diastereomers has been studied at different temperatures by NMR spectroscopy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel synthesis of racemic &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-3-fluorofebrifugine and halofuginone is described. This straight-forward seven-step process relies on an electrophilic fluorination-allylation sequence that generates a mixture of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Cbz protected, diastereomeric 2-allyl-3-fluoropiperidines. On separation, a Wacker oxidation-methyl functionalisation sequence enabled introduction of the required quinazolinone portion. Finally, removal of the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Cbz protecting group lead to isolation of the 3-fluorofebrifugine dihydrobromide analogues that are of potentially pharmacological use. Analysis of the NMR spectra for each stereoisomer provides information concerning the preferred conformers of the different diastereomers. Evidence indicates that the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-diastereomer favours a conformation where the F-atom occupies an axial orientation. In contrast, for its &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-stereoisomeric counterpart, the 2-substituent overrides any F-atom effect and it preferentially occupies a conformer where both substituents occupy equatorial positions. Finally, interconversion between the &lt;i&gt;cis-&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;trans-&lt;/i&gt;diastereomers was studied. In DMSO-d&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and as their free-bases, isomerisation of each diastereomer gave a common 65&#8201;:&#8201;35 ratio of &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;- to &lt;i&gt;cis-&lt;/i&gt;3-fluorofebrifugine. Determination of the reaction rate constants for the isomerisation process at different temperatures enabled calculation of the activation energy barriers, for each process, using an Arrhenius plot. The activation energy barrier for the isomerisation of the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-isomer was 94.3&#177;4.9&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, whereas for the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-isomer it was 84.5&#177;3.9&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A highly efficient N&#8208;heterocycle assembly method for the synthesis of 2,4,6&#8208;triaryl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazines and 2,4,6&#8208;trisubstituted pyrimidines from amidines and alcohols by acceptorless dehydrogenation has been developed.

Abstract
A novel and highly efficient method for the synthesis of 2,4,6&#8208;triaryl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazines and 2,4,6&#8208;trisubstituted pyrimidines from amidines and alcohols has been established. Using an Earth&#8208;abundant and air&#8208;stable chromium salt catalyst and a phosphine&#8208;free ligand, the developed Cr&#8208;catalyzed acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling provides 1,3,5&#8208;triazines and pyrimidines with high yields and good functional group tolerance. Moreover, the synthetic value of this operationally simple protocol was demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale experiment and the synthesis of the linker to construct various supramolecular complexes.

         <title>Ambient Pressure Hydroformylation &#8211; A Key Step to Meso&#8208;Alkyl BODIPYs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient four&#8208;step, five reaction sequence has been developed for the synthesis of meso&#8208;alkyl BODIPYs on the basis of ambient pressure hydroformylation. The use of a CO/H2 balloon mounted on a Schlenk tube as well as MTBE as the solvent allows for an easier to reproduce and environmentally benign synthetic method. The synthesis of 23 derivatives in up to 67&#8201;% overall yield shows the applicability of the developed method.







Abstract
Herein, a highly efficient five&#8208;step reaction sequence to meso&#8208;alkyl BODIPYs is presented. In our previous work, the hydroformylation of terminal alkenes was used to generate an aldehyde from an alkene via rhodium catalysis and use them in a subsequent tandem reaction to obtain BODIPY dyes. However, the use of higher pressures and therefore autoclaves as well as their necessary equipment might limit others to use this method. The refined approach in this work employs ambient pressure hydroformylation, done in a simple Schlenk tube and using a CO/H2 balloon, as key step towards an easier meso&#8208;alkyl BODIPY synthesis. Additionally, the use of MTBE instead of chloroform as reaction solvent results in a greener approach. Readily available and easily synthesizable alkenes as well as different pyrrole building blocks can be used to extend the range of known alkyl&#8208;BODIPYs. The synthesis of 23 derivatives with overall yields of up to 67&#8201;% demonstrates the wide applicability and advantages of the refined method.

This study presents a novel regioselective formal [2+3] cyclization reaction using &#945;&#8208;keto sulfines derived from arylacyl sulfoxides and thioamides. The method enables the synthesis of thiazole&#8208;5&#8208;thiones in a step&#8208;economic, one&#8208;pot process without catalysts, showcasing a new approach for constructing dithioate (S=C&#8722;S&#8722;) skeletons through a tandem sequence of reactions.







Abstract
Aiming to develop novel annulation reactions using sulfine intermediates, we have established a regioselective formal [2+3] cyclization reaction of &#945;&#8208;keto sulfines generated from the elimination of arylacyl sulfoxides and thioamides. This new strategy allows for the synthesis of thiazole&#8208;5&#8208;thiones directly without catalysts or additives. The approach features a step&#8208;economic, one&#8208;pot characteristics via a tandem sequence of in&#8197;situ &#945;&#8208;keto sulfines generation, regiospecifically nucleophilic attack or [3+2] cyclizatoin, dithioate (S=C&#8722;S&#8722;) skeletons formation, and subsequent intramolecular nucleophilic cyclization. This reaction also represents a novel method for constructing dithioate (S=C&#8722;S&#8722;) skeletons.

         <title>Rhodium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrogenative Transformations of N&#8208;Sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;Triazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles have emerged as a powerful tool for many annulations, X&#8722;H bond insertions or functionalizations under rhodium catalysis. The reaction of N&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles with Rh(II) complexes gives rise to highly electrophilic &#945;&#8208;imino rhodium carbene intermediates that can be readily incorporated to construct various nitrogen&#8208;based building blocks. Considering the significant importance of N&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles in synthetic chemistry, in this review, we have described Rh&#8208;catalyzed transformations of this valuable synthon since 2014.







Abstract
N&#8208;Sulfonyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles are valuable precursors for the generation of &#945;&#8208;imino carbene intermediates in the presence of the metal catalysts, especially rhodium(II) complexes. Due to the presence of electrophilic carbene and nucleophilic nitrogen, these reactive intermediates can easily be incorporated into many annulations, cycloadditions, C&#8722;H or O/N/S&#8722;H bond insertions and functionalization reactions. A large number of pharmaceutically important nitrogen&#8208;based building blocks can be constructed via this direct and atom&#8208;economical carbene strategy.

     alt="Rhodium(II)-Catalyzed Denitrogenative Transformations of N-Sulfonyl-1,2,3-Triazoles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N-Sulfonyl-1,2,3-triazoles have emerged as a powerful tool for many annulations, X&#8722;H bond insertions or functionalizations under rhodium catalysis. The reaction of N-sulfonyl-1,2,3-triazoles with Rh(II) complexes gives rise to highly electrophilic &#945;-imino rhodium carbene intermediates that can be readily incorporated to construct various nitrogen-based building blocks. Considering the significant importance of N-sulfonyl-1,2,3-triazoles in synthetic chemistry, in this review, we have described Rh-catalyzed transformations of this valuable synthon since 2014.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Sulfonyl-1,2,3-triazoles are valuable precursors for the generation of &#945;-imino carbene intermediates in the presence of the metal catalysts, especially rhodium(II) complexes. Due to the presence of electrophilic carbene and nucleophilic nitrogen, these reactive intermediates can easily be incorporated into many annulations, cycloadditions, C&#8722;H or O/N/S&#8722;H bond insertions and functionalization reactions. A large number of pharmaceutically important nitrogen-based building blocks can be constructed &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; this direct and atom-economical carbene strategy. In this review, we have described the transformations of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-sulfonyl-1,2,3-triazoles based on &#945;-imino rhodium(II) carbene intermediates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Characterization of BODIPY based 1H&#8208;Tetrazole Ligands</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four novel fluorescence active ligands (1&#8208;4) consisting of a 1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl moiety as coordinating unit and a 4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene (BODIPY) derivative as fluorophore, bridged via alkyl (&#8208;(CH2)n&#8208;, n&#160;=&#160;1&#8209;3) or benzyl (&#8208;CH2&#8208;C6H4&#8208;) spacers were designed. Successful synthesis is demonstrated by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, as well as powder and single crystal XRD analysis. The methylene bridged ligand 2 (4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3,5,7&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;8&#8208;[(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methyl]&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene) crystallizes in different polymorphs and solvatomorphs, in contrast to the other three ligands, which show no polymorphism under identical conditions.

         <title>Efficient Hydroboration of Ketones and Imines Using Amidophosphine&#8208;Borane Under Catalyst&#8208;Free Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amidophosphine borane {(BH&#8323;)&#8322;(PPh)&#8322;N(CH&#8322;)C&#8326;H&#8325;} is used as a competent reducing agent for the hydroboration of ketones and imines with an excellent yield of corresponding secondary alcohols and secondary amines under mild and catalyst&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
We report here the use of amidophosphine borane {(BH&#8323;)&#8322;(PPh)&#8322;N(CH&#8322;)C&#8326;H&#8325;} as a competent reducing agent for the hydroboration of ketones and imines under mild and catalyst&#8208;free reaction conditions yielding the corresponding secondary alcohols and secondary amines after aqueous work. Solid amidophosphine boranes, which are easy to synthesize, and easy to handle demonstrated excellent reactivity and functional group tolerance toward a wide variety of ketones and imines, including aromatic, heteroaromatic, and aliphatic derivatives with electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating substitutions, thus showing excellent chemoselectivity.

         <title>Polyphosphoric Acid Catalyzed C&#8722;H Dinitration of Passivated Aromatic Compounds with Potassium Nitrate under Mild Condition</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A safe and highly efficient method for the dinitration of various aromatics has been developed, using KNO3 as nitrating agent, polyphosphoric acid as both solvent and catalyst. This approach provides a safer and more efficient alternative to the conventional mixed acid system, making it suitable for a range of substrates, especially highly deactivated arenes.







Abstract
Dinitroaromatics are valuable organic compounds. However, the high value of these compounds is accompanied by significant risks and formidable challenges. Herein, we report a safe and highly efficient method for the dinitration of various aromatic compounds, using KNO3 as nitrating agent, polyphosphoric acid as solvent and catalyst. This approach provides a safer and more efficient alternative to the traditional mixed acid system, making it suitable for a range of substrates, especially highly deactivated arenes.

         <title>Aryl Radicals Generated from Aryl Pinacol Boronates Modify Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here a distinct reaction, which generates aryl radicals from aryl pinacol boronates under mild aqueous conditions&#160;and can be used for peptide and protein modifications. The strategy leverages&#160;the&#160;versatile reactivity&#160;of aryl pinacol boronates to form aryl radicals in presence of ammonium persulfate&#160;(APS). The formed aryl radicals insert readily into peptide disulfide bonds while tolerating other functionalities. On the protein level, the reactivity extends beyond the disulfide bonds. The methodology benefits from&#160;the&#160;accessibility of starting aryl pinacol boronates, as well as&#160;biocompatible conditions. In contrast to conventional methods used for aryl radical generation, the strategy is metal&#8208;free, does not require photoinduction and can be readily performed under aqueous conditions. The mechanism of the reactions was investigated by radical&#8208;trapping experiments, spectroscopic analysis and oxygen scavenging. The presented approach broadens&#160;the application of aryl pinacol boronate esters in radical reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermolecular Carbanion Attack on Nitro vs. Carbonyl Group: Experimental and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly efficient one&#8208;pot synthesis of a series of indeno[2,1&#8208;b]quinolin&#8208;6&#8208;ones 10 and indolo[1,2&#8208;b]isoquinoline&#8208;6,12&#8208;diones 12 is portrayed from easily accessible starting materials such as indan&#8208;1&#8208;ones 7 and 2&#8208;nitrobenzaldehydes 9. The reaction mechanism studies by control experiments and computational analysis reveal that the reactions are initiated by attack of a conjugate base of indanones 7 to the aldehyde group or the adjacent nitro group of 2&#8208;nitrobenzaldehydes 9 followed by intramolecular cyclization involving a second anion to furnish the appropriate products. The heterocyclic compounds were obtained in moderate to good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Diastereoselective Radical Cyclopropanation of Olefins via Cobaloxime&#8208;Based Metalloradical Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metalloradical catalysis (MRC), predominantly exemplified by metalloporphyrin complexes, has emerged as a promising strategy for regulating radical reactions and broadening their synthetic applications. In this paper, we report that cobaloxime complexes, functioning as a surrogate for metalloporphyrin systems, can mediate radical cyclopropanation of olefins using donor/acceptor&#8208;type carbene precursor &#945;&#8208;aryl diazoacetates through the MRC process. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, yielding cyclopropane derivatives in good yields with high diastereoselectivity. The reaction exhibits extensive substrate tolerance, encompassing gram&#8208;scale transformations and the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. Our discoveries underscore the potential of cobaloxime&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation as a valuable asset in organic syntheses and further expand the repertoire of metalloradical systems in catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>First Total Synthesis of Deinococcucin A, a Key Glycolipid Found in Cell Membranes of Extremophilic Bacteria.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deinococcucin A is a secondary metabolite isolated from a gut bacteria of carpenter ant, member of extremophilic Deinoccocus family. The structure is a glycolipid containing N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine, linked in &#945; anomeric position to a chiral 2,3&#8208;dihydroxypropanamide moiety. We succeeded a new strategy starting directly from N&#8208;acetylglucosamine and transforming in an efficient manner an allyl group to the corresponding chiral &#945;&#8208;hydroxyamide. Three key steps were used: the oxidation of primary amine to nitrile using TCCA, as well as its hydrolysis to the corresponding amide using palladium (II) catalyzed conditions. The synthesis was completed in only 10 steps with an overall yield of 3%.</dc:description>

         <title>Merging New and Old Concepts: Tandem Oxidative Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover Ritter Amidation via Multicomponent Photo&#8208; and Electrochemical Processes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen&#8208;containing drug molecules and pharmaceuticals are ubiquitous, rendering the construction of C&#8211;N bonds a crucial target in methodology development. The Ritter reaction is a well&#8208;established method for accessing C&#8211;N bonds by generating amide functionality through the reaction of carbocations and nitriles. Since its discovery back in 1948, the Ritter reaction has progressively advanced towards milder and more sustainable conditions for carbocation generation. In this regard, notable contributions have been made by means of single electron transfer (SET) chemistry. Nowadays, photo&#8208; and electrochemistry are established methods of choice for the generation of reactive radical intermediates and their subsequent oxidation via radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPC) mechanism. We review recent examples of tandem RPC and Ritter&#8208;type protocols, demonstrating how photo&#8208; and electrochemical energies have been effectively harvested to expand the precursor pool for the Ritter reaction and also reimagine the process with novel mechanisms and additives.</dc:description>

We review recent examples of tandem RPC and Ritter-type protocols, demonstrating how photo- and electrochemical energies have been effectively harvested to expand the precursor pool for the Ritter reaction and also reimagine the process with novel mechanisms and additives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Trideuteromethyl Sulfide</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The methylthio group plays a significant role in antitumor bioactive molecules, candidate drugs and natural products. Deuteration modification of drugs, which could prolong the half&#8208;life, reduce toxicity, and enhance targeting, has become an important strategy in the development and discovery of innovative drugs. Combining the unique properties of the methylthio group with the deuteration effect, the rapid introduction of trideuteromethylthiol groups into small organic molecules is essential for advancing the research and development of deuterated drugs. With the rapid development of new trideuteromethylthiolation reagents, this review first outlines the indirect introduction of trideuteromethylthiol groups, and then discusses the direct nucleophilic, electrophilic and free radical trideuteromethylthiolation methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Ethynylene&#8208;Bridged Pentacene Trimer and Tetramer Prepared Through Unexpected Oligomerization and Their Subsequent Thermal Conversions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethynylene&#8208;bridged acenes, which are &#960;&#8208;conjugated triple bond&#8208;containing systems, have attracted increasing interest as promising organic semiconductor materials due to their delocalized&#160;&#960;&#8208;electrons. In this study, ethynylene&#8208;bridged pentacene precursor oligomers were not only synthesized through multiple&#8208;organic reactions but also were unexpectedly obtained in one&#8208;pot by using a conventional reaction with lithium silylacetylide and quinone. In the case of one&#8208;pot synthesis, the formation of oligomers, including pentamer, was evidently confirmed by matrix&#8208;assisted&#8208;laser&#8208;desorption/ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis visualized the ethynylene&#8208;bridged structure of the dimer which was one of the major products in the one&#8208;pot reaction. It was found that the reaction time for the lithiation was the key factor in controlling oligomer formation. Finally, the thermal conversion from pentacene precursors to the corresponding pentacene oligomers was achieved via retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. These results would open an access to synthesize a wide range of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Direct N&#8211;C(sp2) Nitrone Synthesis from Oxime</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrones are pivotal in organic chemistry, especially for the synthesis of natural and biologically active compounds via 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions and Kinugasa reactions. Although numerous methods have been reported for the synthesis of nitrones with an sp3 carbon connected to a nitrogen atom, the development of nitrones with an sp2 carbon linkage, including N&#8208;vinyl, N&#8208;aryl, and N&#8208;alkoxycarbonyl nitrones, remains relatively underexplored. This review summarizes the current research trends and methodologies for the direct synthesis of nitrones, in which an sp2 carbon is directly bonded to a nitrogen atom, beginning with oximes.</dc:description>
