         <title>UNDERSTANDING GOLD&#8208;ALKYNE ACTIVATION FROM BOND DISSOCIATION ENERGIES OF GOLD&#8208;ALKYNE COMPLEXES</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A detailed approach into electronic effects of ligands on gold&#8208;alkyne interactions has been carried out in the gas phase using tandem mass spectrometry. A semi&#8208;empirical method coupled to DFT calculations was used to quantify ligands effects on Au&#8208;CC bond strength. To this end, the critical energies of 16 [L&#8208;Au&#8208;hex&#8208;3&#8208;yne]+ complexes with different L ligands were determined through collision induced dissociation. It was observed that electron&#8208;rich ligands destabilize the gold&#8208;alkyne bond, whereas phosphites and carbenes strengthened it. The influence of alkyne electronic effects on the gold&#8208;alkyne bond has also been studied by dissociation in tandem mass spectrometry on four different alkynes. In an original approach, two successive ion&#8208;molecule reactions within the mass spectrometer were used to measure the relative affinity of gold to an alkyne by exchange reactions. The result is that the more electron&#8208;rich the alkyne, the stronger the gold&#8208;alkyne bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Rh Diene Catalysis under Confinement: Isoxazole Ring&#8208;Contraction in Mesoporous Solids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent immobilization of chiral dienes in mesoporous solids for asymmetric heterogeneous catalysis is highly attractive. In order to study confinement effects in bimolecular vs monomolecular reactions, a series of pseudo&#8208;C2&#8208;symmetrical tetrahydropentalenes was synthesized and immobilized via click reaction on different mesoporous solids (silica, carbon, covalent organic frameworks) and compared with homogeneous conditions. Two types of Rh&#8208;catalyzed reactions were studied: (a) bimolecular nucleophilic 1,2&#8208;additions of phenylboroxine to N&#8208;tosylimine and (b) monomolecular isomerization of isoxazole to 2H&#8208;azirne. Polar support materials performed better than non&#8208;polar ones. Under confinement, bimolecular reactions showed decreased yields, whereas yields in monomolecular reactions were only little affected. Regarding enantioselectivity the opposite trend was observed, i.e. effective enantiocontrol for bimolecular reactions but only little control for monomolecular reactions was found.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical Cascade Annulation of Biphenyl Acrylamides to Dibenzoazepinones: Experimental and DFT Studies</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient method for the conversion of biphenyl acrylamides to dibenzoazepinones with &#8208;SCF3 incorporation is described. This operationally simple radical cascade reaction employs CAN as an oxidant and exhibits good functional group tolerance. Substrates featuring &#8208;OCH3, &#8208;CH3, &#8208;Br or &#8208;Cl at the para&#8208;position of the aromatic ring exhibits a preference for an ipso&#8208;cyclization due to the intervention of DMSO in the reaction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide valuable insights into the reaction&#8217;s energetics and product selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalization of 1,3&#8208;Butadiene Derivatives under Photo/Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced or electrochemically catalytic functionalization of 1,3&#8208;butadiene to construct diverse allyl compounds with valuable groups was reviewed. Through direct 1,4&#8208;, 1,2&#8208;, or 2&#8208;functionalization, a lot of functional groups, such as alkyl groups, nucleophilic reagents, phosphoryl groups, aryl groups, or alkyl alcohol, were introduced in mild, green, and atom&#8208;economy conditions.







Abstract
In recent years, the functionalization of 1,3&#8208;butadiene has become an attractive strategy for constructing allyl compounds with molecular and structural complexity, and the current research focuses on synthetic chemistry and organic synthesis. Compared with the traditional synthesis method, the synthesis methods promoted by photochemistry or electrochemistry represent an environmentally friendly and mild strategy. In this review, the functionalization reactions of 1,3&#8208;butadiene under photochemical/electrochemical processes in recent years are reviewed according to the classification of functionalization systems, with particular emphasis on the corresponding reaction mechanism, which lays a foundation for further exploration of new catalytic methods.

         <title>Selenosulfones, a Meetup of Chalcogens: A Journey Into Their Recent Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent chemistry involving selenosulfones is here presented. Their preparation as well as their reactivity in the context of addition reactions, C&#8722;H functionalization and nucleophilic substitution is detailed together with other chemistry involving this functional group. This is the first review article focused on this precise topic ever reported in the literature.







Abstract
A mini review focused on the chemistry of selenosulfones reported since 2019 is here presented. Initially, methods aimed to the preparation of such moiety are discussed. Successively 1,2&#8208;, 1,3&#8208;, 1,4&#8208; and 1,7&#8208;addition reactions to C&#8722;C single and multiple bonds are illustrated. The forth chapter focuses on electrophilic aromatic substitutions. The fifth chapter deals with C&#8722;H functionalizations while the sixth one shows the reactions with aryl diazonium salts or its precursors. The radical coupling with redox active reagents, is the subject of section seventh. Selenosulfones challenged in nucleophilic substitutions and in reactions with phosphorus&#8208;containing compounds are shown in chapter eight and nine followed by the conclusions and perspectives section.

         <title>Fabrication of a Highly Efficient and Reusable Pd/Al2O3/Al Monolithic Catalyst for the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anodization was employed to treat the aluminum foil surface, leading to in situ the generation of Al2O3, consequently amplifying the specific surface area to aid in the dispersal of palladium nanoparticles. Through the anodic oxidation of aluminum followed by a precipitation&#8208;deposition and calcination process, a highly efficient and reusable Pd/Al2O3/Al monolithic catalyst was synthesized. The effectiveness and reusability of the Pd/Al2O3/Al monolithic catalyst were evaluated in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction. The turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) of the Pd/Al2O3/Al monolithic catalyst reached 73,880 and 0.86 s&#8208;1, respectively. Furthermore, the catalyst could be recovered and reused in reactions regardless of the used substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Monofluoromethylthioesters from Acyl Chlorides with Elemental Sulfur and Fluoroiodomethane</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical nickel&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of monofluoromethylthioesters from acyl chlorides has been developed. In this protocol, acyl chloride intermediates were initially formed and then subjected to the nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction with S8 and ICH2F, delivering the corresponding products in moderate to high yields.







Abstract
We report an unprecedented Ni&#8208;catalyzed direct monofluoromethylthiolation of acyl chlorides, in&#8197;situ generated from carboxylic acids, with elemental sulfur (S8) as the S source and fluoroiodomethane (ICH2F) as the CH2F radical source to produce a series of monofluoromethylthioesters in moderate to good yields. This approach features excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. Additionally, the late&#8208;stage monofluoromethylthiolation of complex bioactive molecules can also be accomplished using this method.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, efficient and environmentally friendly method is proposed for the synthesis of a series of structurally diverse phosphine&#8208;glycine derivatives by direct irradiation of glycine derivatives and diarylphosphine oxides with blue visible light at room temperature using only air (oxygen) as an oxidant. A possible mechanism was also proposed in conjunction with controlled experiments.

         <title>Leveraging Propargyl Sulfides as Radical Trappers for the Synthesis of Sulfonyl Allenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work showcases a novel visible&#8208;light mediated allenylation protocol employing propargyl sulfides as a radical trapping methodology. An array of substituted sulfonyl allenes were successfully synthesized under mild conditions. Mechanistically, this process entails the formation of sulfonyl radicals, their subsequent addition to alkynes, the elimination of S&#8208;centered radicals, and Cl&#8208;atom abstraction, thereby facilitating the propagation of this radical chain reaction.

Mechanistically, this process entails the formation of sulfonyl radicals, their subsequent addition to alkynes, the subsequent elimination of S-centered radicals, and Cl-atom abstraction, thereby facilitating the propagation of this radical chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strain&#8208;Driven [3+2] Cycloaddition of Triazine 1&#8208;oxides with Arynes/Cyclooctyne: Access to Benzisoxazoles/Cyclooctyne Fused Isoxazoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 4&#8208;carboxylates of 1,2,3&#8208;triazine 1&#8208;oxides undergo [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition with in situ generated benzynes and naphthyne and also with cyclooctyne that, following retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder extrusion of dinitrogen, form isoxazole&#8208;3&#8208;propenoate derivatives in high yields and diastereocontrol. This practical method occurs at room temperature and provides a wide range of isoxazole based heterocycles with diverse functionality. 1,2&#8208;naphthyne, an unsymmetrical alkyne, forms only one regioisomeric product, exemplifying inherent regioselectivity. Although high, stereoselectivity is not 100% in most cases, indicating that the loss of dinitrogen is stepwise. Derivative reactions of benzisoxazoles suggest their versatility.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A KOtBu&#8208;promoted robust strategy has been described for the regioselective synthesis of pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]quinolin&#8208;1&#8208;one and naphthyridin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;one derivatives from o&#8208;alkynylquinolinecarbonitriles in good to excellent yields. The reaction proceeds through in&#8208;situ transformation of nitrile moiety into amide group followed by the selective C&#8208;N bond formation via a 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig or 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig annulation reaction. Among the synthesized derivatives, 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig naphthyridin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones displayed good photophysical properties. The present approach is superior to other established methodologies owing to avoiding use of transition metals and column chromatographic purification and affording the products in high yields.

         <dc:description>Fluorine&#8208;containing compounds are important in medicine or crop&#8208;protection. Herein, we show asymmetric organocatalytic Michael/oxa&#8208;Michael cascade leading to chiral fluorinated pyrans under mechanochemical conditions.

Ball&#8208;milling convey the reaction in short times and high product yields, while keeping high enantiomeric purities of products.

         <title>Theoretical Mechanism Study of BH3&#8208;Mediated Reduction of P&#8208;Stereogenic Hydroxyalkylphosphine Oxides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The BH3&#8208;mediated reduction of P&#8208;stereogenic hydroxyalkylphosphine oxides was investigated by Density Functional Theory calculations. By combining theoretical approaches with experimental observations, we explored two mechanisms that account for its stereospecificity, implying an inversion of the configuration at the phosphorus atom. One mechanism proceeds through a cyclic intermediate in which the coordination of borane to the oxygen atoms lowers the BH3.THF&#8208;attack barrier. However, the free energy barrier for this combined process is too high for a reaction feasible at room temperature. The calculations rather support a second mechanism that proceeds through from the same cyclic intermediate and the in&#8208;situ formation of BH4&#8208; as reducing agent.</dc:description>

An organic&#8208;superbase&#8208;catalyzed glutamation of phenols, thiophenols, secondary amines and imides has been realized through Michael addition between &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters and benzophenone&#8208;imines of glycine esters. 3&#8208;Substituted glutamic acid esters were obtained in excellent yields and diastereoselectivities (up to quantitative yield and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr) in THF by using LiBr as an additive at room temperature.







Abstract
1,8&#8208;Diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene (DBU) catalyzed Michael addition reactions between &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters and benzophenone&#8208;imines of glycine esters have been realized in THF at room temperature by using LiBr as an additive, effectively enabling the glutamation of phenols, thiophenols, secondary amines and imides. 3&#8208;Substituted glutamic acid esters were obtained in excellent yields and diastereoselectivities (up to quantitative yield and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr). These glutamic acid esters were readily converted into their corresponding pyroglutamic acid esters in high yields through acidic hydrolysis followed by lactamization.

A general method to prepare 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;pyrido[2,3&#8208;b]pyrazines from 3&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;fluoropyridine is described.

Abstract
The electrophilic activation of 2H&#8208;azirines with triflic anhydride (Tf2O) for an addition/cyclization reaction producing 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;pyrido[2,3&#8208;b]pyrazines regioselectively is described. This reaction proceeds via nucleophilic addition of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;fluoropyridines onto 1&#8208;trifloyl&#8208;aziridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl triflates and subsequent cyclization via SNAr. Desulfonylation and oxidation provides a single regioisomer of the aza&#8208;bicyclic heterocycle after treatment with Et3N. Optimization of the reaction conditions lead to a range of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;pyrido[2,3&#8208;b]pyrazines in isolated yields of 20&#8201;% to 60&#8201;%.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Based Deep Eutectic Solvents: Key Players for Amide and Sulfonamide Synthesis and Alcohol Oxidation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective and sustainable oxidation of secondary alcohols to their corresponding carbonyl compounds, alongside their applications as selective mono&#8208;alkylating reagents for both amide and arylsulfonamide derivatives, is achieved under aerobic and mild (40&#8201;&#176;C) conditions in reusable Fe&#8208;based Lewis acidic deep eutectic solvents.







Abstract
A sustainable protocol has been devised for the oxidation of activated secondary alcohols to their corresponding carbonyl compounds, as well as their utilization as selective mono&#8208;alkylating reagents for both amide and arylsulfonamide derivatives. These reactions proceed smoothly and in good yields (up to 98&#8201;%) when conducted in Fe&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents (DESs), which serve dual roles as solvents and catalysts. Operating under mild (40&#8201;&#176;C) and aerobic conditions, these transformations are completed within a 4&#8197;h time frame. A pharmacologically relevant amide derivative, specifically a PMRT1 inhibitor, has also been successfully synthesized on a 3&#8197;g&#8208;scale utilizing a reusable FeCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O/glycerol Lewis acidic DES.

         <title>Recent Progress in the Photocatalytic Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Primary Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Tertiary primary amines (&#945;&#8208;TPAs) bearing a fully substituted carbon center adjacent to the N&#8208;unsubstituted amino group (&#8208;NH2) exhibit unique biochemical and physicochemical activities. While due to the sterically congested structure and strong nucleophilic and alkaline natures of these N&#8208;unsubstituted primary amine compounds, their facile synthesis remains an inherent challenge. Traditional methods commonly rely on tedious N&#8208;protection/deprotection operations and highly reactive organometallic reagents, thus leading to poor atom and step&#8208;economy and limited functional group compatibility. Modern photoredox catalysis offers a robust tool to prepare such structurally unique and synthetically valuable amine architectures via a radical pathway under extremely mild conditions. In this review, the recent progress in photocatalytic synthesis of &#945;&#8208;TPAs is systematically reviewed, and the reaction scope, limitations, and mechanisms for the reactions are discussed.</dc:description>

Different minor diarylated side products were formed, depending on whether electron deficient aryl or pyridyl iodides were used as the coupling partners. Cleavage of the 8&#8208;aminoquinoline directing group provided small bridged compounds that may be of value in fragment based drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new strategy for thiochromen&#8208;4&#8208;one synthesis that relies on the denitrative formal [5 + 1] cycloaddition of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;ones with thioacetamide is described. Achieved under reaction conditions that did not require transition metal catalysis, nor the exclusion of air or moisture, the reaction is suggested to involve exploiting the propensity of thioacetamide to undergo hydrolysis under basic conditions. This is follows by addition of the ensuing sulfide anion to the 1,3&#8208;alkynone and a nucleophilic aromatic substitution and denitrative rearomatization cascade to give the S&#8208;heterocyclic product in yields of 41&#8208;99%.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Pyridone ribo&#8208;C&#8208;Nucleosides via Heck Reaction and Oxidation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleosides find applications in medicinal chemistry, chemical biology and diagnostics. Among the nucleosides, C&#8209;nucleosides have attracted particular attention because their carbon&#8208;carbon bond between nucleobase and ribose provides stability against degradation. While several well&#8208;established methods exist for the synthesis of 2'&#8208;deoxy&#8208;C&#8208;nucleosides, the preparation of their ribofuranosyl counterparts is more challenging. Established methods for their synthesis give mixtures of anomers and require harsh reagents or conditions. Here we report a diastereoselective glycosylation method involving a Heck reaction between a glycal and an aryl iodide, followed by oxidation of the silyl enol ether with methyl(trifluoromethyl)dioxirane (TFDO). The resulting ketone is then diastereoselectively reduced to the ribonucleoside. The new route has been applied to pyridones and is expected to also yield other ribo&#8208;C&#8209;nucleosides in diastereoselective fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>Green Light&#8208;Responsive D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D Quinoxaline Emitters for Luminescent Solar Concentrators: Potential Integration in Agrivoltaic Systems</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new family of quinoxaline&#8208;based dyes for the assembly of luminescent solar concentrators (LSC) with promising performances for applications in agrivoltaic technologies. These materials are transparent to the photosynthetically relevant green radiations, while strongly absorb other wavelengths with good emission in the red region of the visible spectrum.







Abstract
The integration of photovoltaic technologies within agricultural settings, also known as agrivoltaics, is attracting increasing attention as a sustainable approach to ensure both clean energy and food supply. The success of this strategy relies on the development of innovative materials that can selectively convert specific wavelengths into energy while being transparent to photosynthetically relevant light. To this aim, here we report our endeavors in the synthesis of a new class of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D quinoxaline fluorophores and their use in the preparation of wavelength&#8208;selective luminescent solar concentrators. The dyes were expeditiously prepared following a direct arylation protocol and extensively characterized by spectroscopic analyses and computational studies. They present high light harvesting ability in the green region of the visible spectrum and good emission properties, which were fully retained in the solid state when embedded into a poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) matrix. These materials were employed to construct LSC devices of promising efficiency, fostering further developments for the use of wavelength&#8208;selective LSC in agrivoltaic systems.

         <title>FeF3&#8208;Promoted Radical Fluoroalkylation of o&#8208;Alkenylaryl Isocyanides to Access 2&#8208;Fluoroalkylated Quinolines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for preparing quinolines through iron(III)&#8208;promoted radical fluoroalkylation was developed. In the presence of FeF3 and Cs2CO3, a variety of o&#8208;alkenylaryl isocyanides smoothly underwent the radical fluoroalkylation with perfluoroalkyl iodides to afford biologically important 2&#8208;fluoroalkylated quinolines in 38&#8211;81&#8201;% yields. Moreover, the conditions are compatible with nonfluorinated alkyl iodides leading to 2&#8208;alkylated quinolines.







Abstract
An iron(III)&#8208;promoted radical fluoroalkylation of o&#8208;alkenylaryl isocyanides has been developed using readily available perfluoroalkyl iodides as fluoroalkyl source. This cyclization reaction features broad substrate scope and provides a simple and efficient approach for regioselective construction of biologically important 2&#8208;fluoroalkylated quinolines in 38&#8211;81&#8201;% yields.

         <title>Linear &#960;&#8208;Extension of Acridone by the Fusion of Cyclobutadienoid</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalization of small aromatic heterocycles is a straight and efficient method to access large polycyclic conjugated molecules. However, due to its unique reactivity, the derivatization of acridone usually gives the product in the angular shape and is difficult to obtain the linear ones. Here we report the direct functionalization of acridone to generate its linearly fused derivatives containing cyclobutadienoid via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed arene&#8208;(oxa)norbornene annulation followed by the dehydrated aromatization. The experimental characterizations demonstrate that the antiaromatic cyclobutadienoid ring can extend the molecular conjugation. Theoretical calculations reveal the weakened aromaticity of neighboring benzenoid rings of cyclobutadienoid with no influence on the electronic structure of central pyridone. The molecular stability is enhanced in comparison to that of linear acridone derivatives containing only six&#8208;membered rings.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Trifluoromethylated Ketones by Photocatalyzed Deoxygenative Coupling of Aromatic Acids with &#945;&#8208;CF3 Substituted Styrenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl alkenes are versatile CF3&#8208;containing feedstocks. They have been widely used to construct gem&#8208;difluoroalkene scaffolds via &#946;&#8208;F elimination. The application of &#945;&#8208;CF3 alkenes as trifluoromethylating reagents has been less explored. In this paper, we report an efficient route for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylated ketones from easily&#8208;accessed &#945;&#8208;CF3 styrenes and aromatic carboxylic acids under photoredox catalysis. The reactions proceed through phosphoranyl radical&#8208;promoted deoxygenation of aromatic acids, generating acyl radicals for subsequent hydroacylation of &#945;&#8208;CF3 styrenes. The valuable trifluoromethyl&#8208;containing compounds could be produced in good yields under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Indirect and Regioselective Phosphonation of Azobenzenes: Toward the Design of Water&#8208;Soluble Photoswitches</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H acyloxylation of azobenzenes enabling the regioselective introduction of the double&#8208;functionalized phophonoacetate motif was developed. The method proved tolerant for a wide range of substituents. Chemoselective hydrolysis of the diethylphosphonate function leads to a water&#8208;soluble azobenzene with interesting photophysical properties, holding great promise for the design of water&#8208;soluble photochemical tools for future biological applications.







Abstract
An efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed ortho C&#8722;H acyloxylation of azobenzenes, allowing the introduction of the difunctionalised substituent, diethylphosphonoacetate, is reported. Thanks to the mild reaction conditions implemented, this regioselective late&#8208;stage ortho&#8208;functionalization tolerates a wide range of functional groups and permits the access of diversely substituted azobenzenes in good to excellent yields. Selective hydrolysis of the diethyl phosphonate group leads to stable water&#8208;soluble azo&#8208;photoswitches with interesting photophysical properties such as an extended Z&#8208;isomer half&#8208;life, opening new opportunities in the design of optochemical tools for the exploration of living organisms.

         <title>New Strategies to Improve the Efficiency of Curcumin&#8208;Based Iridium Complexes for OLED Devices</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among the solid&#8208;state lighting technologies, OLEDs occupy a prominent position for the high efficiencies associated with the low CO2 emissions. In line with the recent studies aimed at designing sustainable and biodegradable devices, herein we report on the synthesis of a series of iridium(III) complexes featuring, as &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands, curcumin and 6&#8208;dehydrogingerdione, two natural compounds found in the rhizome of Curcuma longa and Zingiber officinale. To improve the solubility of both the ligands and prevent the aggregation of the complexes, oleoyl residues were inserted on the phenolic &#8208;OH groups. The resulting complexes exhibited a green emission with quantum yields as high as 2.8% (relative to fluorescein). OLED devices were fabricated by using, as emitting layer, a host&#8208;guest blend of the iridium complex in 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bis(N&#8208;carbazolyl)&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenyl (CBP). The morphological analysis revealed that thin films of the emitting layer were homogeneous. The devices fabricated with iridium complexes from 6&#8208;dehydrogingerdione exhibited higher luminance, efficiency and power efficiency with respect to the corresponding devices obtained from curcumin; also the functionalization of the &#946;&#8208;diketone unit with the oleoyl residue proved to increase significantly the performance of the device. Overall, these data suggest that aggregation is a key factor that compromise the performances of the corresponding OLEDs.</dc:description>

To improve the solubility of both the ligands and prevent the aggregation of the complexes, oleoyl residues were inserted on the phenolic -OH groups. The resulting complexes exhibited a green emission with quantum yields as high as 2.8% (relative to fluorescein). OLED devices were fabricated by using, as emitting layer, a host-guest blend of the iridium complex in 4,4&#8217;-bis(N-carbazolyl)-1,1&#8217;-biphenyl (CBP). The morphological analysis revealed that thin films of the emitting layer were homogeneous.

         <title>Application of DNA&#8208;Conjugated Aryl Diazonium Intermediates in DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 20, May 27, 2024. </description>

This concept article aims to offer a systematic overview of the progression and utilization of DNA&#8208;conjugated diazonium intermediates, thereby contributing to the renewed comprehension of their applications and potential in chemical biology.







Abstract
Aryl diazonium intermediates have emerged as highly versatile intermediates in modern organic synthesis and chemical biology, demonstrating remarkable reactivity under mild reaction conditions. Their significance has extended to DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DELs), where they serve as valuable alternatives to traditional aryl halide&#8208;based cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Aryl diazonium intermediates as N2&#8208;annulation synthons can efficiently transform into benzotriazinone core on DNA besides C&#8722;C coupling. This concept paper illuminates recent advances in this field, emphasizing their applications and potential across various facets of DELs, off&#8208;DNA chemistry, DELs selection, and DNA&#8208;based probes. It is anticipated that these developments will propel the broader utilization of DNA&#8208;conjugated aryl diazonium salt intermediates in DELs, protein labeling, hit discovery, and other interdisciplinary fields.

         <title>[N&#8722;I&#8722;N] Type Halogen Bonding: Structure, Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 20, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
[N&#8722;I&#8722;N] type halogen bonds have gradually attracted much attention. This concept summarizes the structure, classification, synthesis, and application of [N&#8722;I&#8722;N] type halogen bonds. The challenges in this field were identified and its development prospects are also discussed.







Abstract
Halogen bond has received widespread attention in recent years due to the vast applications in supramolecular chemistry, sensing and crystal engineering. In contrast to the normal halogen bonds, [N&#8722;I&#8722;N] type halogen bond exhibits enhanced strength and solvent resistance capabilities. It adopts a bonding geometry of the three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron bond, where the nitrogen can be a neutral, positive, or negative species such as pyridine, saccharin, and urotropine moieties. The emerging new type halogen bond has found specific potentials in constructing supramolecular architectures and catalysis. This concept provides a brief summary based on recent developments of [N&#8722;I&#8722;N] type halogen bonding, reviewing and summarizing its synthesis, structure and application.

         <title>A Simple Device for Automated Mixing of Heterogeneous Solid&#8208;Liquid Reactions During In&#8208;Situ Monitoring by NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 20, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plunger&#8208;based device has been developed for the automated mixing of heterogeneous solid&#8208;liquid reactions in a 5&#8197;mm tube inside a standard NMR probe. The plunger design, plunger velocity, settling time, and mixing&#8208;to&#8208;acquisition time ratio are explored by NMR and UV&#8208;Vis to determine the optimum parameters for reaction kinetics to be monitored in&#8208;situ.







Abstract
In&#8208;situ NMR spectroscopy can provide valuable insight into chemical reactions, including detailed information on reaction kinetics and thus mechanism. The application of in&#8208;situ NMR techniques to heterogeneous reactions has so far been limited by the requirement for efficient mixing, which is challenging within the confines of a standard NMR spectrometer. We report an automated plunger&#8208;based device for the mixing of heterogeneous solid&#8208;liquid reactions conducted within a 5&#8197;mm tube in a standard NMR probe, allowing reaction kinetics and speciation to be monitored in&#8208;situ. The system has been tested by measuring the kinetics for three diverse reactions and comparison of these with the reaction velocities measured by routine ex&#8208;situ analysis after sampling. The effect of key parameters including plunger design, plunger velocity, solid settling time, and mixing&#8208;to&#8208;acquisition time ratio are explored to determine the optimum parameters for combining efficient mixing with spectral quality. With adaptation, the device may also be suitable for benchtop NMR.

         <title>Nitrile Furanics via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydration of Aldoximes and Knoevenagel Condensation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 20, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrile furanic compounds have been prepared employing two simple synthetic approaches; i) dehydration of aldoximes and ii) Knoevenagel condensation. Both methodologies were firstly tested and optimized on furfural and thus exploited on 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furfural (HMF) and 5,5&#8217;&#8208;oxy(bismethylene)&#8208;2&#8208;furaldehyde (OBMF). All the resulting products were achieved in good to excellent yield and isolated as pure employing simple purification procedure.







Abstract
In this work two synthetic approaches to introduce nitrile moieties into bio&#8208;based derived furanic compounds were investigated, i.&#8201;e., dehydration of aldoximes and Knoevenagel condensation. Both methodologies have been first tested and optimized on furfural and thus exploited on 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furfural (HMF) and 5,5&#8217;&#8208;oxy(bismethylene)&#8208;2&#8208;furaldehyde (OBMF). The syntheses of furfural, HMF and OBMF aldoximes were efficiently conducted (also in large scale) under mild reaction conditions and short reaction time. The subsequent dehydration to nitrile furanic compounds was carried out in the presence of catalytic amount of copper acetate monohydrate. Furthermore, Knoevenagel condensations were performed on furfural, HMF and OBMF with different Activated Methylene Group compounds, using for the first&#8208;time dimethyl carbonate as the reaction media. Most of the resulting products were isolated as pure via simple liquid&#8208;liquid extraction in good to excellent yields. Future applications of these compounds might include aldoxime reduction into amine furanics &#8208; herein also preliminary investigated &#8208; and hydrolysis of the nitrile derivatives in the related carboxylic acid (or ester) furanics. All these products are interesting monomers for the preparation of bio&#8208;based polymers.

         <title>Halogen Promoted Desulfurative Cleavage of Cyclopropylmethyl Thioethers and Amination of the Formed Cyclopropylcarbinyl Cations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 20, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclopropylmethyl sulfides react with N&#8208;fluorosulfonimide (NFSI) or molecular iodine, enabling C&#8722;S cleavage to generate cyclopropylcarbinyl cations, which evolve through cyclopropane ring&#8208;opening reactions into homoallyl cations suitable to react with nucleophiles present in the reaction media. This desulfurative cleavage of cyclopropylmethyl thioethers under non&#8208;acidic conditions facilitates homoallylation of N&#8208;based nucleophiles such as alkyl or aryl amines as well as sulfonimides through a one&#8208;pot protocol in one or two steps depending of the nucleophile.

         <title>Hydroxymethyl&#8208;Substituted Tetrathiatriarylmethanol with Variable Reactivity: Selective Access to Three Different Trityl Radicals by Unique Acid&#8208;Mediated Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 20, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of hydroxymethyl&#8208;substituted tetrathiatriarylmethanol with different acids are described. The reaction conditions were optimized for the selective synthesis of hydroxymethyl, methyl and aldehyde derivatives of trityl radicals as well as their deuterated analogues, which exhibit distinct EPR spectra and redox properties, thus suggesting applicability to in&#8208;cell EPR/dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP).







Abstract
Tetrathiatriarylmethyl radicals have found wide applications in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and imaging as well as dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). Recently, intense effort has been devoted to the derivatization of trityl radicals, but there is still a lack of highly efficient methods for access to these radicals. Herein, we report novel acid&#8208;mediated protocols for straightforward and selective synthesis of the hydroxymethyl, aldehyde and methyl derivatives of trityl radicals from the sole substrate hydroxymethyl&#8208;substituted tetrathiatriarylmethanol. The resulting trityl radicals exhibit various redox properties as shown by their cyclic voltammetric results. Importantly, the use of these protocols enables site&#8208;specific deuteration of the three trityl radicals, which show unique EPR spectral properties. Overall, our study reveals the crucial effect of the acids on the synthesis of these trityl radicals and provides a new approach for selective access to different trityl radicals, thus enriching their synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Exploring the Reactivity of Melanins as Photocatalysts for Reductive Dehalogenations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 20, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reductive dehalogenation of &#945;&#8208;halogenated carbonyl compounds has been performed by exploiting four different melanin polymers in the role of photocatalyst. The reaction smoothly took place under visible light irradiation in the presence of sodium ascorbate as an additive. The melanin obtained from 5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole 2&#8208;carboxylic acid offered the best performance, especially in the reduction of brominated substrates.







Abstract
Four melanin polymers prepared from different precursors (5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole, 5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole 2&#8208;carboxylic acid, 1,8&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene and dopamine) have been adopted as photocatalysts in the reductive dehalogenation of a series of model &#945;&#8208;halogen carbonyl derivatives. The best performing melanin was that obtained from 5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole 2&#8208;carboxylic acid, which allowed to dehalogenate efficiently both bromomalonate esters and phenacyl bromide; on the other hand, chloromalonate esters were almost unreactive under the same reaction conditions. Electrochemical and control experiments enabled to elucidate the reaction mechanism, demonstrating the key role of electrons as charge carriers in the observed photocatalytic process.

         <title>Double Winding Vine&#8208;Shaped Biphenyl with Molecular Asymmetry. Synthesis, Structure, and Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 20, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biphenyl strapped by two chains between benzene rings gives a double winding vine&#8208;shaped structure suggesting a new class of molecular asymmetry, in which enantioinversion hardly occurs.







Abstract
A biphenyl derivative in which two benzene rings are strapped with two chains is prepared. The synthesized product shows molecular asymmetry, which was confirmed by HPLC analysis with chiral column and named as winding vine&#8208;shaped biphenyl. The synthesis of such vine shaped molecule was performed by ring&#8208;closing metathesis or alternatively by annulation with nosylated ethylenediamine. The structure of the obtained product was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The absolute configuration of the molecular asymmetry was assigned after leading to the corresponding camphor sulfonamide through denosylation and re&#8208;amidation process.

The successful realization of direct palladium&#8208;catalyzed C8&#8208;fluoroalkylation and C8&#8208;fluoroalkenylation of naphthalene derivatives has been accomplished, employing iodonium salts as coupling partners. The reactions exhibited complete C8&#8208;regioselectivity, and diverse carbonyl groups were identified as effective directing groups.







Abstract
In this study, two novel C8&#8208;functionalization methods of 1&#8208;carbonylnaphthalenes were developed. Leveraging iodonium triflates as coupling partners, we disclose palladium&#8208;catalyzed C8&#8208;fluoroalkylation and C8&#8208;fluoroalkenylation processes. These protocols exhibit broad applicability across diverse naphthalene derivatives, owing to carbonyl directing groups at the C1 position which can be retained for subsequent applications or selectively removed, enhancing the versatility of the developed methodologies.

Abstract
An efficient method has been developed to facilitate the addition&#8208;ring opening cascade reaction of vinylogous oxindole, resulting in the synthesis of a variety of aza&#8208;bicyclic maleimide derivatives with high yields and exceptional diastereoselectivities. Furthermore, the product could be effectively and easily transformed into the difluoromethylenecyclohexane skeleton through a dehydrofluorination process.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient method has been developed to facilitate the addition-ring opening cascade reaction of vinylogous oxindole, resulting in the synthesis of a variety of aza-bicyclic maleimide derivatives with high yields and exceptional diastereoselectivities. Furthermore, the product could be effectively and easily transformed into the difluoromethylenecyclohexane skeleton through a dehydrofluorination process. This methodology demonstrates significant potential for the synthesis of aza-bicyclic maleimide skeleton, which possesses biological or pharmaceutical activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>TBAI&#8208;Catalyzed, TBHP&#8208;Mediated Modular Three&#8208;Component Cascade Towards Highly Functionalized Pyrrole via [3+2] Annulation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 20, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, one&#8208;pot sequential synthesis of highly substituted pyrrole under the metal&#8208;free condition catalyzed by TBAI/TBHP was demonstrated. &#946;&#8208;Enaminone generated in&#8197;situ from &#946;&#8208;ketoesters and primary amines reacts with electron&#8208;deficient alkynes to synthesize penta&#8208;substituted pyrroles.







Abstract
A facile, one&#8208;pot sequential synthesis of highly substituted pyrrole employing TBAI/TBHP has been developed from readily available precursors. &#946;&#8208;Enaminones generated in&#8197;situ from &#946;&#8208;ketoesters and primary amines react sequentially with electron&#8208;deficient alkynes via a radical pathway to form the penta&#8208;substituted pyrroles in moderate to good yields. This strategy for the synthesis of highly functionalized pyrroles can be scaled up and shows tolerance to a variety of amines.

The arylation of 5,4&#8208;disubstituted 2,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;3H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3&#8208;thiones was investigated under Ullmann&#8208;type reaction conditions involving ligand&#8208;free Cu(0) catalysis, the results of which showed that the reaction proceeds chemoselectively with the formation of S&#8208;arylation products. In some cases, when an electron&#8208;withdrawing group is present in the arylating agent, the reaction can proceed without a catalyst.







Abstract
We investigated the S&#8208;arylation of 5,4&#8208;disubstituted 2,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;3H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3&#8208;thiones under ligand&#8208;free Cu(0) catalysis employing Ullmann&#8208;type reaction conditions. We determined optimal reaction conditions and assessed the impact of substituents in the arylating agent on the reaction progress. Notably, the presence of an electron&#8208;withdrawing group (EWG) in the aryl halide facilitated the reaction even without a catalyst. In particular, an EWG in the para position of the aromatic ring exerted a directing effect on the leaving group, regardless of the halogen present.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free ipso&#8208;Halocyclization of N&#8208;Arylpropynamides Using Hypervalent Iodine(III) Reagents under Aqueous Condition</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 20, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient intramolecular ipso&#8208;halocyclization of para&#8208;unsubstituted N&#8208;arylpropynamides proceeds using readily available hypervalent iodine reagents as oxidant and potassium halides as halogen source under aqueous medium. This method shows a broad substrate scope and doesn't require any metal catalysts.







Abstract
We report, an intramolecular ipso&#8208;halocyclization of N&#8208;arylpropynamides using readily available hypervalent iodine reagent as mild oxidant and alkali halides like KCl, KBr, and KI as the halogen source. Using this method, a broad range of valuable halogenated spiro[4.5]trienones can be obtained in an excellent yield at room temperature. Notably, this protocol doesn't require para&#8208;substituents such as methoxy or fluoro group on the N&#8208;aryl ring. Also, this reaction takes place in the absence of any metal catalyst under aqueous conditions and exhibits a broad substrate scope with high functional group tolerance. A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed based on control experiments.

         <title>A ChemoEnzymatic Approach for the Preparation of &#8220;Linear&#8208;Shaped&#8221; Diaryl Pyrazines as Potential Antiprotozoal Agents</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 20, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from simple, commercially available aromatic aldehydes, &#8220;linear&#8208;shaped&#8221; diaryl pyrazines were prepared by a novel chemoenzymatic route comprising a biocatalyzed benzoin condensation reaction and a transaminase&#8208;mediated tandem process of transamination and cyclization. The obtained pyrazines were tested for their potential leishmanicidal and antiplasmodial activity in&#8197;vitro.







Abstract
Nitrogenous heterocyclic rings are present in a wide range of drugs, natural compounds, and fine chemicals and are considered privileged scaffolds in medicinal chemistry. Seeking novel anti&#8208;protozoal drugs acting on new targets or by novel mechanisms of action, we focused on a preliminary evaluation of the potential of &#8220;linear&#8208;shaped&#8221; diaryl pyrazines. To this purpose, a two&#8208;enzyme chemoenzymatic synthesis of this heteroaromatic core was carried out. Specifically, starting from simple, commercially available aromatic aldehydes, the target pyrazines were obtained through a sequence of biocatalytic benzoin condensation, chemical oxidation and a transaminase&#8208;mediated tandem process of transamination and cyclization. The profiles of the compounds as antiprotozoal agents were evaluated in&#8197;vitro against parasites cultures of the Leishmania and Plasmodium genera and using the human cell line HepG2.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Synthesis Applied to Optoelectronic and Energy Materials: Design, Applications and Limitations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 27, Issue 20, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic Covalent Chemistry can bring together simple components to create complex self&#8208;assembled materials. This strategy is so far under&#8208;investigated in the field of optoelectronic and energy materials. However, it has the potential to rapidly produce self&#8208;assembled organic semiconductors or stimuli responsive devices. Herein, we highlight the advantages of the dynamic covalent approaches and their limitations when applied to this field.







Abstract
Dynamic Covalent Chemistry, consisting in the use of dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) to create complex objects by working at the thermodynamic equilibrium, has undeniable advantages for the preparation of conjugated systems with tailored optoelectronic properties for organic electronics. Chemists can combine simple building blocks with simple functional groups of appropriate geometry, structure and stoichiometry to build multidimensional conjugated architectures. Dynamic covalent reactions are often precious metal&#8208;free, generate little to no side products and are very efficient. DCBs however afford sensitive materials, and consequently a balance needs to be found between the ease of synthesis, the stability and the performances. The dynamicity of the target materials hence can considerably reduce their applicability in organic electronics where strongly stable materials are needed, but opens the door to stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviour and recyclability. A way to overcome dynamicity issues is to lock DCBs, but often at the cost of decreased conjugation. In this review, we will highlight how DCBs are employed to prepare functional optoelectronically active materials, such as discrete molecules, polymers or covalent organic frameworks, applied in fields ranging from organic light&#8208;emitting diodes and solar cells to organic batteries and transistors. We will also discuss their limitations, benefits and the current challenges to overcome.

         <title>Kanamycin&#8208;Cu(II) Complex Catalyzed Ullmann Amine Synthesis at Room Temperature: A Tool for Mechanistic Insights into Methylene Blue Degradation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study highlights the significance of Ullmann coupling reaction in modern organic synthesis and advances catalytic methodologies through the introduction of a kanamycin&#8208;copper complex as a highly efficient catalyst for the synthesis of diverse N&#8208;Aryl compounds. We demonstrate the catalyst's versatility through the synthesis of 20 Daryl&#8208;amine instances, 21 Ar(het)&#8208;N compounds, and 10 miscellaneous examples. NMR, IR, and UV spectroscopy offers insights into the catalyst's behaviour. Additionally, DFT studies support the catalyst's proficiency in generating SO4 radicals by stabilizing with aminosugars moieties. Ex&#8208;situ NMR experiments confirm a ternary complex&#8208;based mechanism at concentrations below 0.1&#956;M. Furthermore, we showcase the degradation of methylene blue to its precursor amine under optimized conditions. Overall, this research underscores the potential of Ullmann condensation reactions in contemporary organic synthesis and contributes significantly to the advancement of catalytic methodologies.</dc:description>

The optimized protocol in dichloromethane (DCM) solvent achieves good yields (up to 87%) and diastereoselectivity (&gt;20:1). The method's versatility is shown through the synthesis of various derivatives, including chiral variants with up to 82% ee. The intermediates were captured by HRMS, and a plausible reaction pathway was proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Promoted Oxidative Amidation of Imines: A Facile Route to Amides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for preparing amides by imines oxidation is developed using aldehydes and amines as raw materials. Using copper oxide as catalyst and Oxone as oxidant without any coupling reagents, the reaction conditions are mild. A wide substrate range including pesticide and drug molecules has been demonstrated in 32&#8211;90&#8201;% yields.







Abstract
Herein, an environmentally friendly and efficient amidation method of imines by Oxone and CuO has been developed. This facile method shows excellent selectivity without affecting other functional groups such as phenyls, halogens, cyans, esters or heterocycles. This method features a broad substrate scope, mild conditions and high yields (&#8804;90&#8201;%), and the yield in the gram scale experiment also reaches up to 81&#8201;%. Flonicamid, moclobemide and bupivacaine are also successfully synthesized to demonstrate its potential utilities.

This strategy allows efficiently construction of a series of 2&#8208;trifluoromethyl pyridines with broad functional groups.







Abstract
A multicomponent Kr&#246;hnke reaction route toward 2&#8208;trifluoromethyl pyridines from reaction of chalcones with easily available and stable 1&#8208;(3,3,3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxopropyl)pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium bromide and ammonium acetate is reported. The reaction is found to be general with a range of substituted chalcones, and the applicability of the methodology in gram scale is demonstrated. Preliminary results suggest that this transformation is initiated by 1,4&#8208;Michael addition, followed by inter&#8208; and intramolecular nucleophilic addition, and elimination.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Reactions of Alkenes with C&#8722;C Bond Formation: Recent Developments</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkenes are highly valuable materials in organic synthesis, and their three&#8208;component reactions offer a promising method for C&#8722;C bond formation and carbon chain elongation. This approach not only reduces the number of reaction steps but also minimizes waste generation, enabling the preparation of polysubstituted alkanes from simple starting materials. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advancements in this field from 2013 to 2023.







Abstract
Alkenes are highly valuable materials in organic synthesis, and their three&#8208;component reactions offer a promising method for C&#8722;C bond formation and carbon chain elongation. This approach not only reduces the number of reaction steps but also minimizes waste generation, enabling the preparation of polysubstituted alkanes from simple starting materials. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advancements in this field from 2013 to 2023. We have classified the developments into three main categories: (1) reactions triggered by C&#8208;radicals or heteroatom&#8208;radicals; (2) cascades involving three&#8208;membered ring intermediates; and (3) transformations catalyzed by metals. We will discuss a wide range of reactions that involve diazoium salts, arylhydrazines, acids, aldehydes, 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls, diazo compounds, amines, malononitriles, diacyl peroxides, ethers, 1,3&#8208;dithiane, arenes, CuSCF3, selectfluor, Et3N&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3HF, TBHP, CH2Cl2, CHCl3, CO2, CO, KCl, H2O, and other reagents.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alkenes are highly valuable materials in organic synthesis, and their three-component reactions offer a promising method for C&#8722;C bond formation and carbon chain elongation. This approach not only reduces the number of reaction steps but also minimizes waste generation, enabling the preparation of polysubstituted alkanes from simple starting materials. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advancements in this field from 2013 to 2023. We have classified the developments into three main categories: (1) reactions triggered by C-radicals or heteroatom-radicals; (2) cascades involving three-membered ring intermediates; and (3) transformations catalyzed by metals. We will discuss a wide range of reactions that involve diazoium salts, arylhydrazines, acids, aldehydes, 1,3-dicarbonyls, diazo compounds, amines, malononitriles, diacyl peroxides, ethers, 1,3-dithiane, arenes, CuSCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, selectfluor, Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3HF, TBHP, CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CHCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO, KCl, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and other reagents. These reactions lead to alkylation, arylation, or carbonylation products. We believe that this review will be helpful for future research in this area.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atropisomeric Properties of 5N&#8208;Benzoyl&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzodiazepin&#8208;2&#8208;ones: Substituent Effects on Rotation around the Ar&#8722;N(CO) Axis</title>

         <dc:description>
Atropisomeric properties of 5N&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzodiazepin&#8208;2&#8208;one with two Ar&#8722;N(CO) axes moving like gears were investigated. The rotational barrier (&#916;G&#8800;) of the axes was strongly influenced by the electronic effect of the p&#8208;substituent on benzoyl, and the electron&#8208;withdrawing group (EWG) increased the stability of the axes. The &#916;G&#8800; values were linearly correlated with the electronic effect (the Hammett &#963; constants) of functional groups.







Abstract
5N&#8208;Benzoyl&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzodiazepin&#8208;2&#8208;ones with various substituents were synthesized and their atropisomeric properties were analyzed. For the rotational isomers (E/Z) based on the amide bond [N&#8722;C(=O)], the E&#8208;isomers were preferentially formed regardless of the substituents. Atropisomers (aR/aS) due to the Ar&#8722;N(CO) (sp2&#8208;sp2) axis were isolated using chiral HPLC, and the rotational barrier (&#916;G&#8800;) in thermal isomerization was measured. The rotation barrier about the Ar&#8722;N(CO) axis was affected by both the substituents at the C6&#8208;position and the p&#8208;substituents on the benzoyl group. The substituents at C6 (R1) caused both steric and electronic effects. On the other hand, the p&#8208;substituents (R2) on the benzoyl group caused electronic effects: the electron&#8208;donating group (EDG) lowered the &#916;G&#8800; value, whereas the electron&#8208;withdrawing group (EWG) raised it. The &#916;G&#8800; values were linearly correlated with the magnitude of the electronic effect (Hammett &#963; constants) of functional groups (R2). The EDG causes an increase in the electron density on the carbonyl moiety in the amide, which may disturb the planarity of the amide bond, resulting in a decrease in the &#916;G&#8800; value.

         <title>Fluoroalkoxylating Reagents in Organic Synthesis: Recent Advances</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advancement in the development of fluoroalkoxylating (ORf) reagents for the preparation of prestigious ORf&#8208;containing compounds is described in this review.







Abstract
The fluoroalkoxy groups (ORf) are widely used motifs in pharmaceutical and agrochemical fields due to their unique physicochemical properties including higher lipophilicity and increased metabolic stability. Thus, the high value of ORf&#8208;containing derivatives has stimulated the development of fluoroalkoxylation reactions. In this review, we highlight the recent progress of various trifluoroalkoxylating reagents and their applications in organic synthesis in the past five years.

         <title>Novel Imidazole&#8208;based Hydrazonoyl Cyanides and Amidrazones Containing N(N,O)&#8208;Heterocycles: Selective Synthesis, Reaction Mechanisms and Preliminary Anticancer Evaluation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel imidazole&#8208;based hydrazonoyl cyanides and amidrazones containing morpholine, piperidine and N&#8208;methylpiperazine heterocycles were obtained by two competitive pathways, starting from the same imidazole precursors and corresponding heterocycloalkylhydrazines. These imidazoles provide convenient synthetic precursors to a vast array of heterocycles with pharmaceutical applications. The compounds were screened against colorectal cancer cell line HCT116&#8208;p53 wt and significant IC50 values were obtained.







Abstract
Two series of novel hybrid heterocyclic compounds that combine the imidazole ring with bioactive piperidine, morpholine or piperazine heterosystems, through a hydrazone unit, were easily obtained by two competitive pathways. Starting from 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;cyanoformimidoyl imidazoles and 1&#8208;aminopiperidine, 4&#8208;aminomorpholine or 1&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;methylpiperazine under mild acidic media led to the selective synthesis of 5&#8208;aminoimidazole 4&#8208;carboxamidrazones, whereas the corresponding 4&#8208;hydrazonoyl cyanide derivatives were obtained under stronger acidic conditions. These highly functionalized imidazoles provide convenient synthetic precursors to a vast array of heterocycles with potential pharmaceutical applications. The reaction mechanisms were elucidated on the basis of experimental assays and in silico calculations. The compounds were screened against colorectal cancer HCT116&#8208;p53 wt cell line, and significant IC50 values of 3.69&#8197;&#956;M and 4.83&#8197;&#956;M were obtained.

         <title>Trifluoromethoxylation of Arynes using 2,4&#8208;Dinitro&#8208;1&#8208;(trifluoromethoxybenzene) as Trifluoromethoxide Anion Source</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The trifluoromethoxy moiety, an emerging fluorinated group, shows interesting properties for pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications. However, only few methods have been reported for the direct introduction of this group on molecules with high efficiency, safety and low cost. Indeed, most of direct trifluoromethoxylation reagents are either expensive, hazardous or require preliminary synthesis before their use. Here we describe the use of 2,4&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1&#8208;(trifluoromethoxy)benzene (DNTFB) as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, safe, commercially available and cheap source of trifluoromethoxide anion for the trifluoromethoxylation of arynes.</dc:description>

         <title>Selenoureido Calix[6]arenes: A Novel Platform for Pseudorotaxane Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroditopic calix[6]arenes are widely employed macrocycles for the synthesis of pseudo&#8208;oriented interlocked systems and stimuli&#8208;induced molecular machines, among others. Herein, we introduce a new calix[6]arene receptor functionalised with three phenylselenoureido groups. These hydrogen&#8208;bonding donor moieties are able to promote the threading of viologen&#8208;based organic axles inside the macrocyclic cavity to form a stable pseudorotaxane species. Preliminary investigations using 1H&#8208;NMR measurements and semi&#8208;empirical and DFT studies suggested its further use as a platform for the synthesis of rotaxanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Ferrocenyl&#8208;azole Derivatives: Synthesis, DFT Calculation and Unlocking the Anticancer Potential</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Series of novel azoles comprising ferrocenyl, phenyl and thiophenyl derivatives were unveiled via amination of sp2 hybrid vinyllic chlorides in the catalytic presence of iron cluster. Various ferrocenated azoles were evaluated against prostate cancer cells and demonstrated a significant potency at low concentration. HOMO&#8208;LUMO levels and energy gap was calculated by DFT.







Abstract
Herein, a series of novel ferrocenyl/phenyl/thiophenyl&#8208;azoles was disclosed by vinylic amination of ferrocenyl/phenyl/thiophenyl substituted &#946;&#8208;chloro cinnamaldehydes and acrylonitriles. A highly economical and robust chalcogen&#8208;stabilized iron selenide carbonyl cluster Fe3Se2(CO)9 worked as an efficient catalyst under aerobic conditions. The amination of ferrocenyl/phenyl/thiophenyl substituted &#946;&#8208;chloro&#8208;vinylic Csp2&#8208;Cl with azole derivatives was fully established and fabrication of the Csp2&#8208;N bond was completely supported by various spectral analysis. Moreover, wide range of substrates with functionally different azoles were investigated for the present reaction and good to excellent transformation was recorded. Some of the selected ferrocenated azole derivatives were screened for anti&#8208;cancer activity against the prostate cancer cells (PC&#8208;3) and found to be highly active at low concentration of 5.77&#8197;&#956;M with IC50 value. Furthermore, HOMO and LUMO levels and energy gap of some selected compounds were calculated by the density functional theory (DFT).

         <title>Halogenation of Alkenes Using Three&#8208;Component Reactions: A Decade of Development</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkenes are valuable feedstocks in organic synthesis. One effective method for synthesizing organic halides with functional groups in close proximity involves the direct difunctionalization of alkenes via three&#8208;component reactions. This approach not only reduces the number of steps involved in the synthesis process, but also minimizes waste generation and enables the formation of complex molecules from simple starting materials. In this review, we mainly discuss decade developments (2013&#8208;2023) in two categories: (1) halogenation via three&#8208;membered ring intermediates, involving haliranium, thiiranium, seleniranium, aziridinium and epoxide species; (2) halogenation via a radical pathway. Reactions with I2, BiI3, NaI, Bu4N+[I(O2CAr)2]&#8208;, NIS, NBS, NCS, DBH, BsNMeBr, HBr, HCl, KI, NH4I, I2O5, Et3N&#183;3HF, Selectfluor, CuI, CuBr, CuCl, LiCl, KBr, NaCl, SOCl2, Py&#183;9HF, NFSI, TBSCl et al have been recorded and how the added reagents work will be discussed. We hope this review will do help for future research in this area.</dc:description>

         <title>Daphnicyclidin Alkaloids 2001&#8211;2023</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article provides a chronological overview of the 23 structurally diverse daphnicyclidin alkaloids isolated to date and highlights the various synthesis contributions that have been published to date on this unique group of alkaloids.







Abstract
The Daphniphyllum alkaloids represent a particularly diverse class of complex diterpene alkaloids, which are characterized by their enormous structural diversity. The daphnicyclidins, a subgroup of these alkaloids, stand out due to their unique pentafulvene structural motif. This review article gives an overview of the compounds that have been isolated so far and can be assigned to this subgroup. Furthermore, all synthesis approaches and total syntheses published to date are presented.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;free Chloroamination Cyclization Cascade with Sodium Hypochlorite: from N&#8208;(Pentenyl)sulfonylamides to 2&#8208;(1&#8208;Chloromethyl)pyrrolidines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
No catalyst is needed to cyclize a sulfonylated aminoalkene in the presence of commercial sodium hypochlorite, a catalytic amount of a base in tetrahydrofuran (THF), thus obtaining valuable 2&#8208;chloromethylpyrrolidines via a domino process and a key nitrogen&#8208;centered radical







Abstract
A mild and catalyst&#8208;free protocol to obtain several 2&#8208;chloromethylpyrrolidines by the use of a commercial solution of sodium hypochlorite is here reported, without the need for a light source. The choice of the solvent revealed to be crucial in the success of the reaction. Mechanistic studies, both experimental and computational, confirmed a radical mechanism, where the deprotonation step, followed by the oxidation of a N&#8208;centered anion to the corresponding radical, allowed 2&#8208;chloromethylpyrrolidines, by a very fast cyclization, to be obtained. Sodium hypochlorite plays the role of both the oxidant and the chlorine source.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationships of Glucose&#8208;based PdII&#8208;Bis(NHC) Complexes in a Model Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sugar&#8208;based NHC&#8208;complexes of palladium(II) have been prepared from glucosyl imidazolium ionic liquid precursors in high yields in a simple synthetic protocol. These complexes enable Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions in ethanol with low catalyst loadings of 0.005&#8197;mol%.







Abstract
The authors of this work have optimized a novel synthetic route towards glucose&#8208;based PdII&#8208;bis(NHC) complexes in only 4 steps with total yields up to 73&#8201;%. The synthesis route encompasses an Appel reaction towards 6&#8208;iodo&#8208;glucopyranosides, followed by acyl&#8208;protection, then quaternization with imidazoles and finally the conversion of these acyl&#8208;protected glucosyl imidazolium salts to their respective palladium(II)bis(NHC) complexes, via an intermediary silver(I) complex. Overall, 11 acyl&#8208;protected glucosyl imidazolium iodides as NHC&#8208;precursors and 15 complexes have been synthesized. The structure&#8208;activity relationships of different functionalizations in these complexes and their reactivity in a model Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura between bromobenzene and 4&#8208;tolueneboronic acid reaction has been investigated, and a highly reactive complex leading to &gt;99&#8201;% yield at 0.005&#8197;mol% catalytic loading has been found.

         <title>Synthesis and Application of Well&#8208;Defined Fluoroalkyl Zinc Complexes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reviewed the preparation and application of these zinc fluoroalkyl complexes, with a focus on recently reported reactions with potential synthetic interest. From the perspective of reaction mechanism, the transfer of trifluoromethyl from zinc complexes to copper catalysts formed the highly active trifluoromethyl copper reagents, which can be directly used for the fluoroalkylation.







Abstract
Fluoroalkyl groups play an irreplaceable role in the field of pharmaceutical and agrochemical industry due to their unique properties. Based on this, it is crucial to effectively introduce fluoroalkyl groups into target molecules. In this review, we describe the synthesis of well&#8208;defined fluoroalkyl zinc complexes and their applications in the fluoroalkylation of compounds. Different from the reactivities of copper fluoroalkyl complexes, fluoroalkyl zinc complexes often needed to be combined with copper or nickel catalysts when participating in fluoroalkylation reactions. From the perspective of reaction mechanism, the transfer of trifluoromethyl from zinc complexes to copper catalysts formed the highly active trifluoromethyl copper reagents, which can be directly used for the fluoroalkylation. In most cases, the desired target products were provided with excellent yields.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Tabernanthine and Ibogaline: Rapid Access to Nosyl Tryptamines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total syntheses of tabernanthine and ibogaline were enabled by application of a thermal coupling of nosyl aziridine and indoles in eight steps each, 10 and 14&#8201;% yield respectively. A Friedel&#8208;Crafts type macrocyclization facilitated key C&#8722;C bond formation. Regio&#8208; and diastereoselective hydroboration&#8208;oxidation of the resultant macrocyclic alkene enabled C&#8722;N bond formation and furnished the completed isoquinuclidine ring system.







Abstract
We describe the first total syntheses of tabernanthine and ibogaline. Entry to these iboga alkaloid natural products is enabled by a thermal coupling of indoles and aziridines to furnish the requisite nosyl tryptamine starting materials. This route features a Friedel&#8208;Crafts type alkylation to form the key indole&#8208;isoquinuclidine C&#8722;C bond. Finally, a regio&#8208; and diastereoselective hydroboration&#8208;oxidation enables C&#8722;N bond formation to close the isoquinuclidine ring system and deliver tabernanthine and ibogaline in 10 and 14&#8201;% yield respectively. Both syntheses were completed in eight steps.

         <title>Synthesis of Noncoded Amino Acids Bearing a Salicylaldehyde Tag for the Design of Reversible&#8208;Covalent Peptides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the design and synthesis of two novel noncoded &#945;&#8208;amino acids, incorporating a lysine&#8208;engaging salicylaldehyde tag on the side chain. These key building blocks open to the versatile positioning of the electrophile tag within peptide sequences, enabling tailored design of reversible&#8208;covalent peptide binders for clinically&#8208;relevant proteins.







Abstract
Insertion of electrophilic species on the structure of small molecule ligands or peptides is a well&#8208;known strategy to increase their binding affinity for the target protein of interest. Among these reactive units, the salicylaldehyde (SA) tag can form remarkably stable imine bonds with the &#1013;&#8208;amino group of lysine, a highly frequent residue in proteins. In this work, we describe the optimized synthesis of two new noncoded &#945;&#8208;amino acids, starting from l&#8208;homoserine and featuring the SA tag on the side chain. One of these final compounds was successfully inserted into a model tripeptide through in&#8208;solution synthesis. These building blocks will allow the versatile insertion of the SA tag at suitable position of peptide sequences, opening to a tailored design of Lys&#8208;engaging peptide ligands.

         <title>Fluorene and Fluorenone Unnatural Amino Acid Motifs via Diastereoselective Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed sp3C&#8722;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described the construction of racemic and enantiopure (D&#8208; and L&#8208;) fluorene&#8208; or fluorenone&#8208;based novel unnatural amino acid scaffolds. A library of fluorene&#8208; or fluorenone motif installed amino acid motifs possessing anti stereochemistry including phenylalanine norvaline, leucine, norleucine, and 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid, alanine, and non&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives was accomplished. This work is a contribution towards enriching fluorene&#8208; or fluorenone&#8208;based (fluorenyl) unnatural amino acid scaffolds.







Abstract
This paper reports the construction of racemic and enantiopure (D&#8208; and L&#8208;) fluorene and fluorenone&#8208;based novel unnatural amino acid derivatives. The Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed bidentate directing group&#8208;aided arylation of prochiral &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds in racemic, enantiopure carboxamides of amino acids with iodofluorenes was reported. The construction of novel examples of fluorene and fluorenone motifs containing amino acids comprising of norvaline, leucine, phenylalanine, norleucine, 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid derivatives having the anti&#8208;stereochemistry (with good enantiopurity) was accomplished. The construction of bis fluorenyl alanine scaffolds and fluorenyl motif&#8208;containing non&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid (aminoalkanoic acid) derivatives was also reported. Examples of removal of the directing group (8&#8208;aminoquinoline) and phthalimide&#8208;protecting group present in the fluorenyl&#8208;based unnatural amino acid derivatives have been shown. Accordingly, fluorene motif&#8208;based amino acid esters and free amino group&#8208;containing unnatural amino acid derivatives were synthesized. The stereochemistry of the major (anti) diastereomers obtained via the prochiral &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H arylation of norvaline, leucine, phenylalanine, norleucine, 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid derivatives was ascertained from the X&#8208;ray structure of a representative compound. Fluorene&#8208; and fluorenone&#8208;based motifs are vital skeletons in materials and medicinal chemistry research. Accordingly, this work is a contribution towards enriching the library of fluorene and fluorenone unnatural amino acid scaffolds.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper reports the construction of racemic and enantiopure (D- and L-) fluorene and fluorenone-based novel unnatural amino acid derivatives. The Pd(II)-catalyzed bidentate directing group-aided arylation of prochiral &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)-H bonds in racemic, enantiopure carboxamides of amino acids with iodofluorenes was reported. The construction of novel examples of fluorene and fluorenone motifs containing amino acids comprising of norvaline, leucine, phenylalanine, norleucine, 2-aminooctanoic acid derivatives having the &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-stereochemistry (with good enantiopurity) was accomplished. The construction of bis fluorenyl alanine scaffolds and fluorenyl motif-containing non-&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-amino acid (aminoalkanoic acid) derivatives was also reported. Examples of removal of the directing group (8-aminoquinoline) and phthalimide-protecting group present in the fluorenyl-based unnatural amino acid derivatives have been shown. Accordingly, fluorene motif-based amino acid esters and free amino group-containing unnatural amino acid derivatives were synthesized. The stereochemistry of the major (&lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;) diastereomers obtained &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; the prochiral &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)-H arylation of norvaline, leucine, phenylalanine, norleucine, 2-aminooctanoic acid derivatives was ascertained from the X-ray structure of a representative compound. Fluorene- and fluorenone-based motifs are vital skeletons in materials and medicinal chemistry research. Accordingly, this work is a contribution towards enriching the library of fluorene and fluorenone unnatural amino acid scaffolds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Naturally Occurring Cyclic Tetrapeptide JM&#8208;47and Analogues through Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of a Common Scaffold</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular protocol for the total synthesis of naturally occurring cyclic tetrapeptide JM&#8208;47 and analogues has been developed and features cross&#8208;metathesis&#8208;based diversification of a macrocyclic scaffold. The synthesis proceeds in good overall yields and with high stereochemical integrity.







Abstract
A unified approach to access the naturally occurring cyclic tetrapeptide JM&#8208;47 and some of its structural variants from a common macrocyclic scaffold has been developed. The key reactions involved a difficult macrocyclization to access the scaffold, and its late&#8208;stage diversification by cross&#8208;metathesis to access the natural product as well as analogues. The synthesis proceeded in good overall yield and high stereochemical integrity. It also confirms the structure and configuration assigned to JM&#8208;47.

         <title>Commercial Transaminases for the Asymmetric Synthesis of Bulky Amines</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Commercially available transaminases are valuable tools for the synthesis of chiral amine building blocks and are very accessible to the synthetic chemistry community. We demonstrate that selected commercially available enzymes from Codexis&#8217; transaminase collection can accept and aminate bulky&#8208;bulky ketones in up to 99&#8201;%&#8201;ee.







Abstract
Transaminase&#8208;catalysed asymmetric amination is a valuable transformation for the synthesis of chiral amines. However, its use in synthetic chemistry has been curtailed by a narrow substrate scope and limited information on commercially available catalysts. In this work we have explored the substrate scope of selected commercially available transaminases, focusing on prochiral ketones bearing two bulky substituents and their application in both enzyme&#8208;catalysed and enzyme&#8208;triggered reactions. (R)&#8208; and/or (S)&#8208;selective enzymes converted methyl&#8208;, isopropyl&#8208;, n&#8208;butyl&#8208;, and cyclohexyl&#8208;phenone substrates to the corresponding amines in the range of 6&#8211;&gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee. In some cases, a stereochemical switch was detected, in which (R)&#8208;enantioselectivity was observed with enzymes typically assigned as (S)&#8208;selective. Upscaling of selected biotransformations provided chiral amines, in &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee and up to 40&#8201;% isolated yield. Furthermore, transaminase&#8208;triggered reactions, which were previously limited to methyl&#8208; and ethyl&#8208;derivatives, were expanded to phenyl&#8208;derivatives for the formation of a cis&#8208;2,6&#8208;disubstituted piperidine and 2,4&#8208;diphenyl pyrroline, and isolated in up to 67&#8201;% yield.

         <title>Direct Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C5&#8208;Arylation of 1,3,4&#8208;Oxadiazoles with Aryl Chlorides Promoted by Bis(di&#8208;isopropylphosphino) Ferrocene</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct arylation of 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazoles proceeds efficiently at low catalyst loading (0.5 to 1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) with the decisive assistance of sterically constrained ferrocenyldiphosphane ligands. This protocol tolerates electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on the (heteroaryl)aryl halide.







Abstract
The direct palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazoles with challenging aryl chloride substrates is promoted by the use of a specifically designed electron&#8208;rich ferrocenyl diphosphane. This protocol employs 0.5 to 1.0&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst loading without any additives such as copper or ammonium salts, and equally tolerates electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on the (heteroaryl)aryl halides, as illustrated by the efficient synthesis in 86&#8201;% yield of the anti&#8208;tubercular agent PHOXPY (2&#8208;(5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyrazine) by a late&#8208;stage arylation using 2&#8208;chloropyrazine.

         <title>Decatungstate Catalyzed Benzylic C&#8722;H Trifluoromethylthiolation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a decatungstate catalyzed trifluoromethylthiolation of the benzylic C&#8722;H bond. The reaction features mild conditions and good functional group tolerance, generating corresponding products in moderate to good yields with a slight excess of benzylic substrates or as limiting reagents.







Abstract
Here we report a mild protocol for benzylic C&#8722;H trifluoromethylthiolation using sodium decatungstate (NaDT) as the photocatalyst. Wherein, photoactivated DT abstracted the benzylic hydrogen atom via a radical process. This transformation works well with a slight excess of benzylic substrates or as limiting reagents for better purification. The reaction shows mild conditions and good functional group tolerance. Moreover, the protocol could be applied to gram&#8208;scale synthesis.

         <title>Copper&#8208;catalyzed One&#8208;pot Synthesis of 1,3,4&#8208;Oxadiazol&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;ones Using DMF as the Carbonyl Source</title>

         <dc:description>A series of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;ones were prepared by an efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot reaction of arylhydrazides, arylboronic acids and DMF. Moderate to good yield of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;ones were obtained using DMF as the carbonyl source and arylboronic as the aryl source. This reaction involved ligand exchange and transmetalation of copper catalysts with arylhydrazides and arylboric acids, followed by reductive elimination and intramolecular cyclization. Compared to the previous work, this work employs the stable and readily available aryl hydrazide and arylboronic substrates that enhance the practicality of this strategy, and this strategy features a short reaction time, relatively low heating temperature, convenient and more secure. Further, this protocol has the features of high functional group tolerance and reaction scalability.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Formal [4+2] Cycloaddition of Ethynylethylene Carbonates for the Construction of 3,4&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[b][1,4]oxazines</title>

         <dc:description>
A formal [4+2] cycloaddition reaction of ethynylethylene carbonates and 2&#8208;aminophenols has been developed successfully for the synthesis of a series of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[b][1,4]oxazine derivatives.







Abstract
A formal [4+2] cycloaddition reaction of ethynylethylene carbonates and 2&#8208;aminophenols has been developed for the synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[b][1,4]oxazines bearing quaternary carbon atoms. The reaction features mild reaction conditions, good functional group compatibility and good yields. Furthermore, when using chiral PyBox ligand, this strategy could also achieve the asymmetric synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[b][1,4]oxazines. Application studies indicated that the hydroxymethyl group of final products was an excellent functional group that can be further modified easily.

         <title>High Yield Synthesis of Spirocyclic Dienones from Phenols Employing Tribromide Catalysed Dearomatization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalytic strategy towards the tribromide&#8208;catalyzed dearomative spirocyclization reaction is described employing tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) and oxone as an oxidising agent. This methodology leads to the exclusive formation of spirofurano dienones without rearomatization or halogenation. Our group has been on trails of tribromide&#8208;catalyzed dearomative transformation during the last decade, and now this exhibits the first report which delivers high functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope with excellent yield (up to 99%) and good diastereoselectivity (dr up to 14:1).&#160;The oxidation of naphthols as well as phenols is achieved under this mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Fluorinated organic compounds represent an important and growing family of active ingredients in various fields, including material science, pharmaceutical chemistry and biological science. Developing efficient synthetic methods toward fluorinated organic compounds have attracted much attention. In recent years, transition&#8208;metal catalyzed reaction of trifluoro diazo compounds involving trifluoro diazo compounds and their surrogates were a powerful and convenient approach to afford trifluoromethyl&#8208; and difluoromethyl&#8208;substituted compounds of value. In this review, the recent progress in this area is described in the sequence of 2,2,2&#8208;trifluorodiazoethane as carbene precursor, ethyl 3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;diazo&#8208;propionate as carbene precursor, trifluoroethyl amines/amine hydrochloride as the CF3CHN2 surrogate as well as trifluoro aldehydes/ketones N&#8208;sulfonylhydrazones as the trifluoro diazo compounds surrogate.</dc:description>

         <title>2&#8208; and 3&#8208;Fluorocyclobutane Building Blocks for Organic and Medicinal Chemistry</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multigram synthesis of 3&#8208;fluorinated cyclobutane building blocks has been disclosed. The proposed synthetic schemes were based on the nucleophilic fluorination and eventually led to 3&#8208;fluorocyclocutanecarboxylic acid as a key target compound and intermediate. Further functional group transformations provided monofluorinated cyclobutane&#8208;derived alcohols, amines, bromides, thiols, sulfonyl chlorides, etc. Furthermore, the synthesis of diastereopure cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;isomeric 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;fluorocyclobutane&#173;carboxylic acids and amines was also performed. In both cases, diastereomer separation was used to obtain pure stereoisomers. The effect of the fluorine position and relative spatial orientation on the physicochemical properties of the corresponding monoflurinated derivatives was studied by measurements of pKa and logP values.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Functionalization of para&#8208;Quinones: A Historical Review and New Perspectives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct functionalization of quinones has always fascinated research communities due to their biological and redox activities and subsequent application. Quinone motifs play a vital role as precursors for many bioactive compounds and materials; hence, many ingenious methodologies have been elaborated for exploring these units. A significant part of the synthetic strategies towards the functionalized quinones has been achieved by installing substituents on hydroquinones, phenols, or quinone itself by different oxidative coupling reactions via radical pathways with or without the utilization of metal catalysts. The functionalization of simple quinones via direct C&#8208;H bond remains challenging due to their inherited electronic nature and high bond dissociation energy. This review article summarizes the recent advancement made for functionalized quinones through direct functionalization of simple quinones. Our primary focus will be on the synthetic approaches and mechanistic pathways of these reactions that have appeared in the last two decades, along with a short historical importance of the quinone family.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemistry in Organic Synthesis: An Italian Journey through Innovations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemistry, as an enabling technology, harnesses mechanical force to drive chemical reactions, presenting compelling advantages in organic synthesis within the principles of green chemistry.&#160;This review explores how its unique advantages and alignment with sustainable practices have been widely developed in different scientific fields in Italy. As a transformative strategy for organic synthesis, mechanochemistry has been portrayed in this review as a valuable synthetic alternative due to the various advantages, such as solvent reduction and new reaction pathways, that its use brings. Nonetheless, the improvements brought about by its use have also been crucial in other fields of chemistry described by Italian scientists. In this whole context, Italian researchers have analysed both already optimised processes and new feasible pathways, paving the way for new avenues previously hampered by all the limitations that belong to in&#8208;solution chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of a Cobalt Catalyst from ZIF&#8208;67 and Application in the Hydrogenation of N&#8208;Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogenation of N&#8208;heteroarenes to saturated N&#8208;heterocycles is an important reaction in organic synthesis. Hydrogen is a green&#8208;reducing reagent and has been widely applied in industrial production. The development of an appropriate catalyst to realize hydrogenation under low pressure and temperature is desired. In this study, we developed a cobalt&#8208;based catalyst derived from ZIF&#8208;67, and it exhibits high activity for N&#8208;heteroarene hydrogenation under 5&#8208;20 bar hydrogen, which is relatively low compared to reported catalytic systems. This nano&#8208;cobalt catalyst shows a broad substrate scope and can be reused without obvious activity loss.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Stability, Meisenheimer Complex Formation, and Charge&#8208;Transfer Properties of Ultra&#8208;Electron&#8208;Deficient Tetracyano&#8208;Naphthalene Diimides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetra&#8208;cyano substituted naphthalene diimides (TCNDIs) with calculated LUMO of &#8208;5.2 eV, form one of the strongest electron&#8208;acceptors known to date. However, the synthesis and isolation of this class of molecules remain challenging due to its reactivity emanating from its ultra&#8208;electron&#8208;deficiency. Herein we have established an improved synthetic methodology of TCNDIs with cost&#8208;effective reagents and circumventing metallic catalysts. The synthesis is amenable to TCNDIs with the shortest axial alkyl groups, i.e., methyl group and also longer alkyl chains. We also gained insight on how axial alkyl chain lengths influence electron&#8208;deficiency, Meisenheimer complex formation, reactivity, and charge&#8208;transfer of TCNDIs from computation, spectroscopy, and electrochemical studies. The TCNDIs with Me/Et axial groups were found to be more susceptible to moist solvents vis&#8208;&#224;&#8208;vis the TCNDIs with longer alkyl groups. The single crystal structures of the TCNDIs show infinitely &#960;&#8208;stacked structure, and a new C=O&#183;&#183;&#183;C&#8801;N or C&#8801;N&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; motif is discerned. Finally, toluene&#8208;mediated charge&#8208;transfer properties of TCNDIs in the single crystals as well as in solution have been examined.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclopropanation of Aryl and Styryl Acetonitriles With Selenium&#8208;Based Dielectrophiles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Base&#8208;promoted cyclopropanations of aryl or styrylacetonitriles with vinyl selenones are described. The formation of the two new C&#8722;C bonds proceeds through a Michael addition followed by a cyclization. Such reactions are usually difficult with pronucleophiles not bearing an additional geminal electron&#8208;withdrawing group. Operational simplicity, transition metal&#8208;free mild conditions, high yields and excellent regio&#8208; and diastereocontrol are advantages of this protocol.







Abstract
Efficient cyclopropanation reactions of aryl or styrylacetonitriles with vinyl selenones under mild conditions were described. By this approach, synthetically challenging 1&#8208;vinylcyclopropane&#8208;1&#8208;carbonitriles were accessible in good yields. This methodology features the advantage of operational simplicity, broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, mild temperature, and a high level of regio&#8208; and diastereo&#8208;control.

         <title>Synthesis of Sulfo(xo)nium Diacylmethylides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfo(xo)nium diacylmethylides as stable and readily prepared sulfur ylides are versatile synthons. This concept article summarizes their synthetic methods, including the condensation of active methylene compounds with sulfides/sulfoxides, transylidations of diazo compounds and iodonium ylides with sulfides/sulfoxides, acylation of sulfo(xo)nium monoacylmethylides, and the reaction of electron&#8208;deficient alkynes and sulfoxides. Their substrate scopes, proposed mechanisms, selected product examples, limitations, and applications are discussed.







Abstract
Sulfo(xo)nium diacylmethylides (sulfur ylides) are simple, stable, readily prepared, and versatile synthons. Compared with the sulfo(xo)nium monoacylmethylides, they can be compatible with more rigorous reaction conditions and showcase unique characteristics due to their excellent stability. This concept article provides an account for the syntheses of sulfo(xo)nium diacylmethylides, including the utilization of active methylene compounds, carbene precursors, sulfo(xo)nium monoacylmethylides, and electron&#8208;deficient alkynes as substrates, with discussions on substrate scopes, proposed mechanisms, selected product examples, and applications. Challenges for further exploration and prospect on sulfo(xo)nium diacylmethylides in the future are also suggested.

A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free carbonyl reduction and hydrodefluorination of &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethyl enones with hydrosilanes was developed for the synthesis of a variety of gem&#8208;difluorovinyl alcohols. The hydrosilane could act as both a reductive agent and a C(sp3)&#8208;F bond&#8208;breaking promoter under mild reaction conditions. Synthetically useful organofluorides could be readily constructed by the further transformations of the obtained products.







Abstract
A tandem carbonyl reduction and hydrodefluorination of &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethyl enones with hydrosilanes under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions was developed for the synthesis of a variety of valuable gem&#8208;difluorovinyl alcohols. The hydrosilane could act as both a reductive agent and a C(sp3)&#8208;F bond&#8208;breaking promoter under mild reaction conditions. Synthetically useful organofluorides, such as gem&#8208;fluorophosphine alkene, gem&#8208;difluorovinyl ketone, and fluorinated dihydrofuran derivatives could be readily constructed by further transformations of the obtained gem&#8208;difluorovinyl alcohols. Moreover, the method features mild reaction conditions, operational simplicity, excellent functional group tolerance, and scalability.

Debenzylation of O&#8208; and N&#8208;benzyl groups was achieved under safe and mild conditions by using B2(OH)4 as an alternative to gaseous hydrogen in the presence of an amphiphilic polystyrene&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol) resin&#8208;supported nano&#8208;palladium catalyst (ARP&#8722;Pd) in water.

Benzyl groups of a variety of benzylic ethers, esters, carbamates, and amines, including benzyl&#8208;protected carbohydrates and amino acids, were reductively removed in high yields. ARP&#8722;Pd was recovered by simple filtration and reused seven times without a significant loss of its catalytic activity.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Enabling Cyanation of Electron&#8208;poor Carbons with Acetone Cyanohydrin</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein is reported an electrochemical procedure based on the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction of acetone cyanohydrin at a Pt cathode enabling the cyanation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208; unsaturated carbonyl and imines. Catalytic current, along with a correspondingly reduced quantity of supporting electrolyte, facilitates the scalability of the procedure, ensuring brief electrolysis times while maintaining a simple electrochemical design.







Abstract
The Pt&#8208;cathode hydrogen evolution reaction (Pt&#8208;HER) of acetone cyanohydrin provides an alternative method for introducing the cyano group onto electrophilic carbons of imines and chalcones. The synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles and &#946;&#8208;cyano ketones has been achieved smoothly with a small excess of cyanating agent (2 equivalent), catalytic amount of supporting electrolyte and low electricity consumption (0.02&#8197;F/mol). Besides demonstrating a general atom economy, the high Faradaic efficiency, allows for a scale&#8208;up with low&#8208;demanding electrochemical design and short electrolysis times.

         <title>Direct Introduction of an Acetyl Group at the &#945;&#8208;Carbon Atom of an Arene Ring through an Amide Photo&#8208;Fries Rearrangement upon Exposure to UV Light</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;Fries rearrangement using benzoheterocyclic compounds, which are widely used in pharmaceuticals, was studied. Under ultraviolet (UV) light, benzoheterocyclic compounds containing an N&#8208;acetyl group underwent rearrangement of the acyl group directly to the &#945;&#8208;position past the adjacent bridgehead carbon. This environmentally friendly method could be useful in organic synthesis, the pharmaceutical industry, and biochemistry.







Abstract
We employed an amide photo&#8208;Fries rearrangement for the synthesis benzoheterocyclic compounds and found that direct acylation of the &#945;&#8208;carbon atom in an arene ring can occur upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. In this reaction, the N&#8208;acetyl group of amides underwent rearrangement to the &#945;&#8208;position across the bridgehead carbon atom under UV&#8722;C light. The reaction conditions were gentle and safe. Moreover, this reaction proves to be more convenient for selectively manipulating benzoheterocyclic compounds in comparison to traditional approaches involving Lewis acid catalysts or anionic reagents.

         <dc:description>
An electrochemical decarboxylative addition of N&#8208;substituted glycines to enaminones has been developed for the synthesis of C3&#8208;aminomethyl chromones. The products could be generated under oxidant&#8208;, catalyst&#8208;, and light&#8208;free conditions at room temperature, and could act as valuable building blocks to construct polysubstituted pyrimidines with potential bioactivities.







Abstract
An electrochemical decarboxylative addition of N&#8208;substituted glycines to enaminones has been developed and conducted under oxidant&#8208;, catalyst&#8208;, and light&#8208;free conditions in acetonitrile at room temperature by using electron as the traceless oxidant, which provided a green approach to C3&#8208;aminomethyl chromones. The resulting products were formed through radical addition/oxidation/cyclization or electrophilic addition/cyclization pathway and could act as valuable building blocks to construct polysubstituted pyrimidine derivatives.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalysed syn&#8208;Selective Arylnickelation and Cyclisation of Ketone/Imine&#8208;Tethered Terminal Alkynes with Arylboronic Acids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein the substrate scope of a nickel&#8208;catalysed syn&#8208;selective arylnickelation and cyclisation with arylboronic acids is expanded to include ketone and imine&#8208;tethered terminal alkynes. The reaction proceeds via a syn&#8208;aryl nickelation of a terminal alkyne followed by cyclisation of the resulting alkenylnickel species. Along with this the first enantioselective version of the reaction has been developed using PHIM type P,N ligands.







Abstract
Herein we report a syn&#8208;arylnickelative cyclisation with ketone&#8208; and imine&#8208;tethered terminal alkynes (16 examples) in yields of up to 89&#8201;%. The reaction proceeds via a syn&#8208;aryl nickelation of a terminal alkyne followed by cyclisation of the resulting alkenylnickel species onto the ketone or imine. The enantioselective version of this transformation has also been explored with enantioselectivities of up to 83&#8201;:&#8201;17&#8197;er observed.

         <title>Decatungstate&#8208;Photocatalyzed Diastereoselective Dearomative Hydroalkylation of Indoles</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates an efficient dearomative hydroalkylation of indoles using alkanes or ethers as alkyl radical sources and TBADT as a cost&#8208;effective photocatalyst for direct hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). Successful conversion of these heterocyclic derivatives into 2&#8208;alkylindolines with good to excellent yields and high diastereoselectivity is achieved under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
In this study, we present an efficient and straightforward dearomative hydroalkylation of indoles. By utilizing alkanes or ethers as alkyl radical sources and employing TBADT as a cost&#8208;effective photocatalyst for direct hydrogen atom transfers (HAT), we achieved successful conversion of these heterocyclic derivatives into 2&#8208;alkylindolines with good to excellent yields and high diastereoselectivity under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Application of the Photo&#8208;Fries Reaction as a Key Step in the Preparation of Valuable Aryloxyethyl Selenocyanates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multistep straightforward sequence involving the photo&#8208;Fries rearrangement reaction as a key step has been developed for the preparation of aryl selenocyanate WC&#8208;9 analogues. Derivatization the resulting 2&#8208;hydroxyphenones bearing alkyl chains and a phenyl group, followed by acid deprotection, tosylation (or mesylation) and finally treatment with potassium selenocyanate provided the target analogues in good yields.







Abstract
A multistep sequence leads to the preparation of a series of aryl selenocyanate WC&#8208;9 homologues, which are interesting compounds with potential biological activity against Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. The synthetic sequence involves the application of the photo&#8208;Fries rearrangement reaction as a key step for the preparation of a series of 2&#8208;hydroxyphenones bearing alkyl chains of different length and a phenyl group. These intermediates are obtained upon direct irradiation (254&#8197;nm) of 4&#8208;phenoxyphenyl esters in different solvents at room temperature. Then, reaction of the 2&#8208;hydroxyphenones with 2&#8208;(2&#8208;bromoethoxy)tetrahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran followed by acid deprotection, tosylation (or mesylation) reaction and, finally, nucleophilic attack with potassium selenocyanate provides the target aryloxyethyl selenocyanate homologues in good yields.

Conducting the reaction under hydrosilylation conditions and blue light (2*24 W, 450&#8208;460 nm) in the presence of an iron(0) based pre&#8208;catalyst, Fe(CO)4(IMes), amines and alcohols were obtained, respectively, notably at ambient conditions, whereas using white light, higher reaction temperatures up to 100 &#176;C were required. Preliminary mechanism studies highlighted the crucial role of blue light not only to generate the catalytically active species, but also in some steps of the catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

for Asymmetric Conjugate Cyanation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of asymmetric organic molecules has experienced a huge development over the last
few decades. Phase&#8208;transfer catalysis has been proven to be one of the most powerful methods
for these asymmetric transformations. However, the study of the mechanism of these catalysts and
the different interactions that they can establish with the reactants has failed to keep pace. In the
present study, the conjugate cyanation of two different &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones are studied in the
presence of a well&#8208;known alkaloid quinine&#8208;derived PTC, along with different modifications. The study
includes the comparison of different binding modes between the catalysts and the different reactants,
the mechanistic study of the reaction and the analysis of the non&#8208;covalent interactions established
within the complexes and their role in the global enantioselectivity of the process.</dc:description>

The Pd&#8208;catalysed decarboxylative asymmetric allylic alkylation (DAAA) of sterically hindered &#945;&#8208;aryl,&#946;&#8208;amido allyl ester lactams has been developed. The key step in the synthesis of a range of &#945;&#8208;aryl lactam substrates for catalysis was a Pb&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;arylation. A substrate scope of 11 examples of DAAA showed that products containing the di&#8208;ortho&#8208;methoxy&#8208;substituted phenyls and naphthyl groups gave rise to the highest enantioselctivities of up to 82&#8201;% ee.

         <title>Iron Photocatalysis Applied to Oxidative Amidation of Aldehydes with NaCl</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated oxidative amidation of aldehydes promoted by a photoactive complex of Fe2SO4 with 2&#8208;picolinic acid, NaCl as a chlorine source, Na2SO8 as an oxidant, and acetone as the solvent is reported. Fe2SO4 is an earth&#8208;abundant metal salt that is commercially readily available and environmentally sustainable. Sodium chloride is a green and sustainable chlorine source.







Abstract
A synthesis of amides from aldehydes promoted by the photoactive complex of Fe2SO4 with 2&#8208;picolinic acid, NaCl as a chlorine source, and Na2S2O8 as a benign oxidant is reported. The reaction is mediated by visible light and is carried out at room temperature in the absence of additives. Fe2SO4 is a readily available earth&#8208;abundant metal (EAMs) salt, which does not need to be prepared and is environmentally sustainable. Both aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes and mono&#8208; and disubstituted amines have been investigated for this transformation. This study opens intriguing perspectives for extending the application of photoactive complex iron salts toward halogenation processes as well as for C&#8722;H activation reactions and contributes to the field of earth&#8208;abundant metal based catalysis.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Electrooxidative Annulation of Naphthol with Acrylate via C&#8722;H Bond Activation for the Synthesis of Naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]furan</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have sythesized naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]furan derivatives using iridium catalyzed electrochemical coupling of naphthol and acrylates. Ir&#8208;catalyzed oxidant&#8208;free electrochemical C&#8722;H annulation is achieved by electrooxidative C&#8722;H acrylation via weak O&#8208;coordination. This method does not require additives and external chemical oxidants in the syntheses of naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]furans.







Abstract
Iridium catalyzed electrochemical coupling of naphthols with acrylates for the syntheses of naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]furan derivatives are herein reported. Ir&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical C&#8722;H annulation is accomplished within a supportive catalysis manifold, paving the way for electrooxidative C&#8722;H acrylation via weak O&#8208;coordination. The merge of iridium catalysts and electric current not only minimizes the need for a stoichiometric amount of chemical oxidants but also confirms broad reaction compatibility with a variety of electronically and sterically diverse substrates. This utility provides a valuable method for producing a wide range of naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc]furan derivatives in good to moderate yields.

         <title>Selective Oxidation of Sufur&#8208;Containing Flavones: Synthesis of Sulfoxide/Sulfone&#8208;Flavonoids</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocol is proposed for the selective oxidation of flavones, providing various sulfoxide/sulfone&#8208;flavonoids in excellent yields. This strategy features excellent selectivities, high yields and broad substrate scope. The combination of oxone (2KHSO5&#183;KHSO4&#183;K2SO4) as the sole oxidant and NaHCO3/Na2CO3&#160;as the buffer play an important role in the process, in which the amounts of oxone and reaction temperatures are the key to the outstanding selectivities and high efficiency of the reaction. It should be noteworthy that a class of novel sulfone&#8208;flavonols is also synthesized through triple oxidation. Moreover, the glycosylation of sulfone&#8208;flavonols has been realized.</dc:description>

         <title>The Inorganic Ligand&#8208;Supported Copper Catalyst Catalyzing Alkyne Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using (NH4)4[CuMo6O18(OH)6] as the catalyst, accelerates the Glaser&#8208;Hay coupling of alkynes under easy conditions with moderate&#8208;to&#8208;high yields. Both symmetric and asymmetric couplings can be achieved with high selectivity. In addition, the catalyst is non&#8208;toxic, green, environment&#8208;friendly, and it can be recycled for at least six times while maintaining the catalytic activity.







Abstract
Glaser&#8208;coupled synthesized 1,3&#8208;diyne can participate in the generation of conjugated polymers and is now widely used in organic and polymer synthesis. Currently, the catalyst in coupling are mostly based on the complexation of noble metals with complex organic ligands, which inevitably increases the research cost and storage difficulty. However, polyoxometalates (POMs), with acidic and redox properties, can be used as an excellent inorganic ligands with low cost and easy storage. In this work, we have synthesized copper catalyst 1, (NH4)4[CuMo6O18(OH)6] with polyoxometalates as inorganic ligands in a facile way and applied them in the coupling of alkynes to obtain (non)symmetrical conjugated 1,3&#8208;diynes in high yields without bases, finally proposing a reasonable reaction path. In addition, the catalyst showed good tolerance to a variety of different groups, further demonstrating its excellent catalytic activity. It is worth mentioning that the catalyst maintained its good structure and activity after six cycles, demonstrating its promising potential for industrial applications. Thus, this paper provides a new strategy for the preparation of (un)symmetrical diynes using polyoxometalates of Cu as catalyst, and also demonstrates the potential of multi&#8208;acid catalyst for organocatalytic applications.

         <title>A Perspective on Centrohexaindane Chemistry and a Deep&#8208;Sleeping &#8220;Cartesian&#8221; Seed</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple functionalization of the unique three&#8208;dimensional framework of centrohexaindane is discussed in terms of known and yet unknown substitution patterns at the molecular periphery. The potential to employ centrohexaindane derivatives for various molecular extensions in the 3&#8208;space, including the generation of three&#8208;dimensional organic networks based on the C17&#8208;centrohexaquinacene motif, is addressed as a perspective.







Abstract
Centrohexaindane (C41H24), a structurally unique polyaromatic hydrocarbon bearing six mutually fused indane wings stretched out along the Cartesian axes of space, may be viewed as a seed for the construction of covalent and supramolecular three&#8208;dimensional frameworks. A kaleidoscope of established and yet&#8208;to&#8208;be&#8208;explored aspects of centrohexaindane chemistry is presented in this article. After addressing some ideas about the naked centrohexacyclic (and topologically nonplanar) C17&#8208;core, which can be considered a &#8220;centrohexaquinacyne&#8221;, the diversity of known but mostly unknown functionalization patterns at the framework of centrohexaindane is addressed in increasing order of substitution at the twelve equivalent peripheral positions. The variety of centrohexaindanes bearing three identical groups is displayed including a very first access to a centrohexaindane that bears a C3&#8208;symmetrically functionalized tribenzotriquinacene (TBTQ) unit and, thus, a potential for 3D oligocondensation. The diversity of known tetra&#8208; and hexasubstituted centrohexaindane derivatives is presented and conceivable synthesis strategies are discussed for even more highly functionalized derivatives. Finally, the successful access to centrohexaindanes with exhaustive functionalization and hydrocarbon extension at the twelve peripheral positions completes this overview on what may be a vastly open field, still.

&lt;p&gt;Multiple functionalization of the unique three-dimensional framework of centrohexaindane is discussed in terms of known and yet unknown substitution patterns at the molecular periphery. The potential to employ centrohexaindane derivatives for various molecular extensions in the 3-space, including the generation of three-dimensional organic networks based on the C&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;-centrohexaquinacene motif, is addressed as a perspective.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Centrohexaindane (C&lt;sub&gt;41&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;), a structurally unique polyaromatic hydrocarbon bearing six mutually fused indane wings stretched out along the Cartesian axes of space, may be viewed as a seed for the construction of covalent and supramolecular three-dimensional frameworks. A kaleidoscope of established and yet-to-be-explored aspects of centrohexaindane chemistry is presented in this article. After addressing some ideas about the naked centrohexacyclic (and topologically nonplanar) C&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;-core, which can be considered a &#8220;centrohexaquinacyne&#8221;, the diversity of known but mostly unknown functionalization patterns at the framework of centrohexaindane is addressed in increasing order of substitution at the twelve equivalent peripheral positions. The variety of centrohexaindanes bearing three identical groups is displayed including a very first access to a centrohexaindane that bears a &lt;i&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-symmetrically functionalized tribenzotriquinacene (TBTQ) unit and, thus, a potential for 3D oligocondensation. The diversity of known tetra- and hexasubstituted centrohexaindane derivatives is presented and conceivable synthesis strategies are discussed for even more highly functionalized derivatives. Finally, the successful access to centrohexaindanes with exhaustive functionalization and hydrocarbon extension at the twelve peripheral positions completes this overview on what may be a vastly open field, still.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoinduced Remote Selective C(sp3)&#8208;H Alkylation Mediated by Cesium formate</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we developed a photoinduced remote selective C(sp3)&#8722;H alkylation of protected amines in the presence of cesium formate. The protected amines were synthesized from commercially available inexpensive 2&#8208;iodo benzoyl chloride. Under mild reaction conditions, the in situ generated aryl radical is converted to alpha&#8208;amidoalkyl radical via [1,5]&#8208;HAT process, which combines with different Michael acceptors and affords corresponding alkylation products in good yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that formate anion acts as a source of carbon dioxide radical anion (CO2&#8226;&#8722;) and hydrogen atom donor was directly confirmed by isotope&#8208;labeling studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Imidazolium Dicyanomethylides as N&#8208;Ylide Precursors of Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazolium&#8208;ylides are conjugated mesomeric betaines with an exocyclic anionic carbon substituent. These ylides were converted by deprotonation into anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, which can be formulated with two negative charges on the carbene carbon atom due to their origin. Subsequent reaction with selenium gave anionic selenourea compounds.







Abstract
In the past, the use of nitrogen ylides focused primarily on cycloadditions, where the 1,3&#8208;dipole was used as a building block for the formation of heterocycles such as pyrroles or pyrrolinones. In this work, we present a new perspective on imidazolium dicyanomethylides with their synthesis and utilization as anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). The values of relative carbene formation energies (CREF) for a wide range of substituted imidazolium ylides unknown in the literature showed promising properties. In situ trapping reactions of these anionic NHCs with selenium led to anionic, water&#8208;soluble compounds that exhibited remarkable coordination behavior according to X&#8208;ray structure analyses. In addition, the 77Se shifts of the investigated compounds were measured to draw conclusions about their &#960;&#8208;acceptance.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Hydroquinone Linked 3,3&#8217;&#8208;Steroid Dimers via a Modified Mitsunobu Protocol</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient one&#8208;step procedure for the synthesis of O,O&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene&#8208;linked saturated steroid dimers through a modified Mitsunobu protocol is described. The formation of hydroquinone dialkyl ethers from secondary alcohols (steroidal or nonsteroidal) requires the use of a three&#8208;component PBu3/TMAD/Et3N system in a non&#8208;polar solvent. This method allows for the synthesis of a wide range of products with potential biological activity.







Abstract
A successful approach for the construction of steroid dimers with a hydroquinone linker under PBu3/TMAD/Et3N/toluene conditions is described. This study provided a new one&#8208;step methodology for the design and synthesis of bis&#8208;steroidal 1,4&#8208;phenylene diethers using mild and effective reagents.

         <title>Towards the Stable Binding of Mercury: Synthesis and Functionalization of Dibenzyldiazabicyclononane Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A universally applicable synthesis route for the preparation of functionalized diazabicyclononane compounds was elaborated starting from a readily available 1,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;3,7&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1] nonan&#8208;9&#8208;ol by alkylation of both secondary amines with modified benzyl residues containing a bromo, trimethylstannyl, trimethylsilyl, and pinacolboranyl residue. High yields (65&#8208;88%) were achieved, supporting the intended purpose of these compounds: efficient mercuration reactions to stably bind Hg2+. Finally, the C&#8208;9 position of two functionalized diazabicyclononanes was further modified by introducing an azide functionality. This enables the conjugation to biomolecules of interest via click chemistry combined with a tracking by the introduced mercury isotopes.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A universally applicable synthesis route for the preparation of functionalized diazabicyclononane compounds was elaborated starting from a readily available 1,5-diphenyl-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1] nonan-9-ol by alkylation of both secondary amines with modified benzyl residues containing a bromo, trimethylstannyl, trimethylsilyl, and pinacolboranyl residue. High yields (65-88%) were achieved, supporting the intended purpose of these compounds: efficient mercuration reactions to stably bind Hg2+. Finally, the C-9 position of two functionalized diazabicyclononanes was further modified by introducing an azide functionality. This enables the conjugation to biomolecules of interest via click chemistry combined with a tracking by the introduced mercury isotopes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>EDA Complex from BCP&#8208;Thianthrenium Salt: A Catalyst&#8208;free Strategy To Access 1&#8208;Trifluoromethyl&#8208;3&#8208;quinoxaline Derivatives Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The construction of bicyclo[1.1.1.]pentanes (BCPs) typically require the cumbersome use of labile [1.1.1.]propellane in solution and involve multicomponent radical reactions, which commonly produce undesired by&#8208;products that hinder the efficient construction of BCPs. In this paper, we present a catalyst&#8208;free strategy by constructing an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex utilizing the naturally electron&#8208;deficient nature of BCP thianthrenium salt, which were irradiated with visible light to obtain trifluoromethyl&#8208;BCP radicals through a SET process, subsequently reacted with various substituted quinoxalines. Moreover, the successful structural modification of drug molecule derivatives confirm&#160;the utility of this scheme in the field of drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically&#8208;Enabled Construction of N&#8208;Acyl Iminophosphoranes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;acyl iminophosphoranes have shown significant potentials in various areas. This paper presents two electrochemical strategies for the successful construction of a series of substituted N&#8208;acyl iminophosphoranes using electrochemical activation of hydroxylamines or dioxazolones to generate unprotected amide radicals and radical anions. The simple undivided cell with inexpensive electrode setups (graphite felts, carbon rods, and copper sheets) provides excellent substrates tolerance under mild conditions. This simple electrochemical construction of N&#8208;acyl iminophosphoranes also has good scalability, practicability and extensibility. Furthermore, synthetic transformations of the N&#8208;acyl iminophosphorane products have demonstrated the application potentials of the P=N bond.</dc:description>

         <title>4&#8208;Methyltetrahydropyran: a Versatile Alternative Solvent for the Preparation of Chiral BINOL Catalysts and the Asymmetric Alkylation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report that the highly hydrophobic ether 4&#8208;MeTHP&#160;constitutes&#160;a promising resource for the development of sustainable synthetic methodologies grounded on the use of organometallic reagents. The beneficial effects of 4&#8208;MeTHP as reaction media&#160;are&#160;illustrated in the organolithium&#8208;promoted anionic&#160;ortho&#8208;Fries rearrangement of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL)&#8208;based carbamates under bench&#8208;type conditions. The use of 4&#8208;MeTHP induces&#160;a remarkable and unexpected stability of the organolithiums species, enabling the efficient preparation of chiral (bis)carboxamide catalysts. Furthermore, superior performances of 4&#8208;MeTHP than other environmentally responsible solvents&#160;are&#160;observed using the synthesized BINOL catalysts in the asymmetric addition of organozinc reagents to aldehydes. Spectroscopic studies in solution suggest that 4&#8208;MeTHP plays a key role in these reactions&#160;by inducing the preferential formation of a reactive monomeric dinuclear complex. This methodology allows for the asymmetric assembly of enantioenriched secondary alcohols in good yields and high&#160;stereoselectivity, working at 0 &#176;C and under air.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dehydrogenation of unactivated alkanes to form versatile alkenes is an important but challenging task in synthetic chemistry. Enabled by a radical&#8208;mediated formyl group migration, a novel visible light&#8208;induced remote desaturation of aldehydes is developed, delivering a panel of trifluoromethylated &#948;,&#949;&#8208; or &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes in moderate to excellent yields with good functional group tolerance at room temperature. Mechanistic studies indicate a reaction pathway comprising the cascade trifluoromethylation of C&#8208;C double bonds, intramolecular addition to aldehydes, &#946;&#8208;fragmentation of alkoxy radicals, single electron transfer oxidation, and deprotonation. It provides a good complementary approach to the existing desaturation protocols.</dc:description>

         <title>Systematic Investigation of Optical and Chiroptical Properties of Chiral &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Oligomers in Solution and Thin Films</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic investigation of four different families of structurally&#8208;related chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated oligomers, prepared by synthetic strategies involving Palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling protocols, was performed in chloroform solution (absorbance, photoluminescence) and spin&#8208;coated thin films (absorbance, photoluminescence, ECD, optical microscopy).







Abstract
Four families of structurally related chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated oligomers bearing a hydroquinone (HQ), 1,5&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene (Naph), benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophene&#8208;4,8&#8208;diol (BDT) or 9H&#8208;carbazole (CBZ) central core, for a total of 11 new compounds, have been synthesized by simple and versatile synthetic strategies involving Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling protocols: a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction, a Sonogashira/desilylation/Sonogashira sequence or a Sonogashira/desilylation/acyl Sonogashira sequence. A systematic investigation of the optical and chiroptical features of the final chiral dyes was performed in chloroform solution and on spin&#8208;coated thin films.

     alt="Systematic Investigation of Optical and Chiroptical Properties of Chiral &#960;-Conjugated Oligomers in Solution and Thin Films"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A systematic investigation of four different families of structurally-related chiral &#960;-conjugated oligomers, prepared by synthetic strategies involving Palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling protocols, was performed in chloroform solution (absorbance, photoluminescence) and spin-coated thin films (absorbance, photoluminescence, ECD, optical microscopy).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four families of structurally related chiral &#960;-conjugated oligomers bearing a hydroquinone (HQ), 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene (Naph), benzo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;:4,5-&lt;i&gt;b&#8217;&lt;/i&gt;]dithiophene-4,8-diol (BDT) or 9&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-carbazole (CBZ) central core, for a total of 11 new compounds, have been synthesized by simple and versatile synthetic strategies involving Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling protocols: a Suzuki-Miyaura reaction, a Sonogashira/desilylation/Sonogashira sequence or a Sonogashira/desilylation/acyl Sonogashira sequence. A systematic investigation of the optical and chiroptical features of the final chiral dyes was performed in chloroform solution and on spin-coated thin films. The ECD investigation was crucial in revealing that, even within the same family of organic dyes, minor variations in the nature and length of the &#960;-conjugated backbone can result in very different solid-state arrangements at different hierarchical scales.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric reaction of 5&#8208;aminopyrazoles with naphthoquinone esters has been established. A wide range of unprecedented axially chiral naphthylpyrazole derivatives (29&#8197;examples) have been synthesized in moderate to excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;% yield) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee) by utilizing chiral phosphoric acid as a catalyst. This protocol features mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, good scalability and facile derivatization. Moreover, preliminary mechanistic investigation was conducted to elucidate the mechanism.

         <title>Hypersensitive Inhibition of Organocatalysts by Halide Salts: Are Two Catalysts Involved in the Mannich Reaction?</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Can you kill two catalysts with one chloride? Thiourea/urea catalysts are sensitive to inhibition by chloride salts, but here we find that they appear to be too sensitive. Are two catalysts inhibited by a single chloride ion, or are there two catalysts involved in the reaction? Our kinetic detective story suggests the latter!







Abstract
Conformationally flexible tertiary amine &#8211; thiourea&#8722;urea catalysts 1 and 2 for the Mannich reaction between imines and malonate esters are efficiently inhibited by quaternary ammonium halides. NMR titrations, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and NOE experiments showed that the catalysts bind chloride and bromide ions with relatively high affinities (K=103&#8211;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 in acetonitrile). The halide ions not only block the active site of the catalysts, but they also induce refolding into catalytically inactive conformations upon complexation in an allosteric&#8208;like event. At substoichiometric inhibitor:catalyst ratios, the catalysts displayed hypersensitivity to the inhibitors, with overall rates that were lower than those expected from simple 1st order kinetics and 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inhibitor:catalyst stoichiometry. To rationalize the observed hypersensitivity, different kinetic scenarios were examined. For catalyst 2 and the Takemoto catalyst (6), the data is consistent with 2nd order dependency on catalyst concentration, suggesting that a mechanism involving only a single catalyst in the catalytic cycle is not operative. For catalyst 1, an alternative scenario involving 1st order in catalyst and catalyst poisoning at low concentrations of 1 could also rationalize the hypersensitivity. Interestingly, inhibition of catalysts 1 and 2 by halide salts led to significant loss of enantioselectivity, in contrast to the Takemoto catalyst 6 which was inhibited but with essentially no change in enantioselectivity.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Branch&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Alkylation of Indoles and Azoles with Alkenes: An Additive&#8208; and Solvent&#8208;Free Approach</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward nickel&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the C&#8722;H alkylation of indoles and azoles is disclosed that proceeds under additive&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free conditions. The reaction utilizes readily available alkenes as alkylating partners and delivers Markovnikov products with tolerance of sensitive functionalities.







Abstract
The development of sustainable protocols for the synthesis of alkylated heteroarenes is crucial owing to their widespread existence in medicinally relevant and bioactive natural products. Herein, we describe an efficient, additive&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free approach for the regioselective C&#8722;H alkylation of indoles and azoles with alkenes using a nickel catalyst, which proceeds through a chelation&#8208;assistance strategy. The reaction exclusively provided branched alkylated products with the compatibility of alkyl, alkoxy, fluoro, trifluoromethyl, alkene, cyano, ester, and carbonyl groups. This protocol is applicable to other heteroarenes, such as imidazoles and benzimidazoles, providing the desired alkylated products with exclusive Markovnikov selectivity. The synthetic utility and scale&#8208;up of the reaction are demonstrated, and the protocol is in concord with the principles of green chemistry. Alkylation proceeds through facile and reversible C&#8722;H nickelation and alkene insertion processes, presumably involving rate&#8208;limiting reductive elimination.

         <title>Potassium tert&#8208;Butoxide&#8208;Promoted Aerobic Dehydrazination of Arylhydrazines: From Arylhydrazines to Substituent Aromatics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficiently aerobic dehydrazination of arylhydrazines promoted by potassium tert&#8208;butoxide (tBuOK) is detailed in this study. This method smoothly produces aromatics analogues from arylhydrazines using catalytic amount of tBuOK under practical conditions, exhibiting excellent functional group tolerance and a broad substrate scope. The application potential of this approach is further demonstrated through the preparation of deuterated, iodinated and brominated aromatics. Moreover, it shows that this aerobic base&#8208;mediated dehydrazination could be utilized to prepare unsymmetrical aryl sulfides, selenides and tellurides with high efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Optical Property Modulation of Substituted [2.2]Paracylophanes through Through&#8208;Space Conjugation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>4,16&#8208;para&#8208;substituted [2.2]paracylophane with naphthalene (PCP&#9148;NAP), anthracene (PCP&#9148;ANTH), and tetraphenylethylene (PCP&#9148;TPE), as new through&#8208;space conjugated dimers, were prepared by the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction of 4,16&#8208;diboryl[2.2]paracyclophane and the corresponding bromo derivative using Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst and KOH as a base. The synthesized compounds were fully characterized by NMR and HR&#8208;MS, and their photophysical and electrochemical properties were studied. The photoluminescence quantum yield of PCP&#9148;NAP, PCP&#9148;ANTH were determined to be 0.21, 0.50 and for PCP&#9148;TPE in aggregated state 0.31, respectively. PCP&#9148;TPE exhibited aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics when the water fraction was greater than 50% in THF/water mixtures. PCP&#9148;ANTH and PCP&#9148;TPE were also characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, and single crystals of PCP&#9148;ANTH were obtained from the centrosymmetric monoclinic space group C2/c. A single crystal of PCP&#9148;TPE crystallizes in the centrosymmetric triclinic space group P&#9148;1, with one molecule residing at the inversion center. The observed properties of these &#960;&#8208;stacked dimers were compared with respect to through&#8208;space conjugation and conjugation length in the structure.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report the construction of C5&#8208;indole unnatural amino acid derivatives via the diastereoselective Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed prochiral &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H arylation of racemic (DL), and enantiopure L&#8208; and D&#8208;carboxamides of amino acids with 5&#8208;iodoindoles. Independently, indole&#8208;based compounds and amino acid motifs are important small molecules in organic synthesis and drug discovery research. This report aimed to contribute to enriching the library of indole&#8208;based unnatural amino acid derivatives. The synthesis of examples of C5&#8208;indole motif&#8208;installed amino acid derivatives comprising norvaline, phenylalanine, leucine, norleucine, 2&#8208;aminooctanoic acid having anti&#8208;stereochemistry was accomplished. The synthesis of the C5&#8208;indole motif&#8208;containing non&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid (aminoalkanoic acid) derivatives was also reported. The C&#8208;H arylation reactions of racemic and enantiopure carboxamides with 5&#8208;iodoindoles afforded the corresponding indole unnatural amino acid derivatives with good diastereoselectivity (anti, dr &gt;95:5 and enantiopurity (er up to 99:1). Removal of the directing group (8&#8208;aminoquinoline), phthalimide group and preparation of indole amino acid esters and free amino group&#8208;containing indole unnatural amino acid motifs were also shown. The utility of the methodology was shown by synthesizing indole motif&#8208;containing pyrrolidone and peptide molecules. The stereochemistry of the major (anti) diastereomers was ascertained from the X&#8208;ray structure of a representative compound.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Chemistry: Exploring the Use of Electronic Structure, Molecular Dynamics, and Machine Learning Approaches</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review aims to highlight the role that computational chemistry has played in advancing the supramolecular chemistry field. We demonstrated recent uses of computational methodologies to elucidate noncovalent interactions in various processes occurring in supramolecular systems. We also emphasized the contributions of these techniques to studying reactions within confined space, showing how computational methodologies help clarify the effects of reactivity and conformational locking. Furthermore, we underscore the utilization of Molecular Dynamics (MD) in elucidating dynamical processes, understanding temperature and pressure effects, and exploring conformational space within supramolecular chemistry. Finally, we highlight the impact that the age of machine learning has on computational chemistry, showing how these universal approximators can enhance existing methods, predict properties, and efficiently explore the chemical space encompassed by these complex systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Copper&#8208;Free Sonogashira Coupling in Water and under Ambient Atmosphere</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sonogashira coupling on aryl bromides can be carried out under micellar conditions, in the absence of copper(I) catalyst, and under ambient atmosphere. Key of the success is the use of Kolliphor EL, a surfactant capable to form oxygen&#8208;free lipophilic domains in water. The method is applied toward the preparation of both (hetero)arylalkynes and luminescent molecular materials.







Abstract
Sonogashira coupling is one of the cornerstone Palladium mediated cross coupling reactions, giving a direct and high yield access to symmetric and non&#8208;symmetric alkynes with high tolerance of substituents. The method generally requires the use of CuI as a cocatalyst, an inert atmosphere to protect palladium catalyst, somewhat harsh conditions like prolonged heating and the use of organic solvents due to the hydrophobicity of reagents and products. Leveraging on the opportunities offered by micellar catalysis, we here present a general methodology to perform Sonogashira coupling in water, with moderate or no heating, under air, without copper co&#8208;catalysts and at very low catalyst loading. The method offers the same generality and scope of organic solvents based couplings, but strongly improves sustainability while offering excellent yields.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of Cyclic Tertiary Alcohols with Lipase A from Candida Antarctica</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing vinyl hexanoate as an acyl donor with Na2CO3 is the key to substantially improving the reaction rate, substrate scope, and product stability in the KR of racemic tertiary alcohols using commercially available lipase A from Candida antarctica. The KR conditions were applied to cyclic tertiary alcohols containing tetralin, dihydroindene, chromane, and thiochromane moieties, yielding esters with excellent enantioselectivities.

Enzyme&#8208;catalyzed acylative kinetic resolution (KR) and dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic primary and secondary alcohols have been widely reported to produce esters with high enantiomeric purity. In contrast, similar KRs of tertiary alcohols have been reported for only a limited range of substrates and require prolonged reaction times of several days. To gain deeper insight into the substrate scope and increase the process efficiency, we examined the reaction conditions using commercially available immobilized lipase A from Candida antarctica and found that the addition of the heterogeneous, inorganic base sodium carbonate significantly increased the reaction rate while maintaining high enantioselectivity. The use of vinyl hexanoate as the acyl donor provided esters that were stable during chromatography purification. The optimized reaction conditions were then successfully applied to a range of cyclic tertiary alcohols containing tetralin, dihydroindene, chromane, and thiochromane skeletons having, in part, a substituent on the aromatic ring. In this study on the structure&#8211;reactivity relationship of enzymatic KR&#8208;type reactions, we achieved &gt;30&#8201;% conversion for various tertiary alcohols in 24&#8197;h at 25&#8201;&#176;C, producing optically active esters with 88&#8211;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee.

&lt;p&gt;Employing vinyl hexanoate as an acyl donor with Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is the key to substantially improving the reaction rate, substrate scope, and product stability in the KR of racemic tertiary alcohols using commercially available lipase A from &lt;i&gt;Candida antarctica&lt;/i&gt;. The KR conditions were applied to cyclic tertiary alcohols containing tetralin, dihydroindene, chromane, and thiochromane moieties, yielding esters with excellent enantioselectivities.

Abstract
A photocatalyzed oxidation of functionalized cyclobutanones to access &#947;&#8208;lactones has been performed in acetonitrile at room temperature, using anthraquinone derivatives as catalysts in the presence of TFA. The best reaction results were obtained by using 3&#8197;mol&#8201;% of 9,10&#8208;anthraquinone as a catalyst under 370&#8197;nm irradiation in an O2 environment. The scope and the limitations of this reaction have been investigated using both 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;substituted cyclobutanones, as well as enantiopure ketones, to obtain full preservation of their stereochemical identity after the oxidation. The process furnishes in most cases the desired compounds with high purity after catalyst removal by simple filtration, and reducing the production of solvents waste.

         <title>Structural and Electronic Impacts of the Axial Substitution at the Phosphorus Center of C(sp3)&#8208;Bridged P&#8208;Heterotriangulenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematic functionalization of the phosphorus center in the bowl&#8208;shaped dimethylmethylene&#8208;bridged P&#8208;heterotriangulene allowed efficient modulation of its optoelectronic and structural properties. Thorough experimental and theoretical studies revealed the relationship between the s&#8208;character of the P&#8722;X bond and the bowl depth. The compounds form co&#8208;crystals with C60.







Abstract
The structural and electronic properties of the dimethylmethylene&#8208;bridged P&#8208;heterotriangulene have been systematically modulated by functionalization of its phosphorus center. The optoelectronic properties of the obtained derivatives in solution were characterized by UV/Vis absorption and emission spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and 31P NMR spectroscopy. The solid state structures were analyzed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The experimental results were corroborated by density functional theory calculations which revealed the crucial influence of the axial substitution on the bowl&#8208;shaped geometry of the phosphorus&#8208;centered polycyclic scaffold, which is proportional to the s&#8208;character of the P&#8722;X bond. The advantage of the bowl&#8208;shaped P&#8208;heterotriangulene scaffold was demonstrated by successful co&#8208;crystallization with fullerene C60.
