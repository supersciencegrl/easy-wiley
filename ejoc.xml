      <dc:description>Gold(III) coordination of new chiral polydentate (  N,)N,O  &#8208;pyridine based ligands is reported.

Our investigations support an &#945;&#8208;chlorination mechanism where the Cinchona species serves as a nucleophilic catalyst by reacting with the chlorinating agent to generate a chiral electrophilic Cl&#8208;transfer reagent in situ. Using at least 20 mol% of the alkaloid catalyst allows for good yields and enantioselectivities for a variety of different b&#8208;ketoesters under operationally simple conditions.</dc:description>

      <title>A General Method for the Divergent Synthesis of C&#8208;9 Functionalised Sialic Acid Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>Sialic acids, a ubiquitous family of sugars shown to be involved in numerous biologically important processes, exhibit remarkable structural diversity in nature. Access to these derivatives by chemical and enzymatic means is a major bottle neck in understanding the role played by each particular modification. As part of a program to study such roles and determine the substrate specificity of novel sialic acid aldolases, a general and robust synthetic protocol was devised to gain access to all naturally occurring C&#8208;9 functionalised  N&#8208;  acetylneuraminic acid derivatives including esters. These derivatives were synthesised in 11 linear steps from a common advanced intermediate, which allowed for divergent modification at the C&#8208;9 position. Four substitutions were installed in this study: O&#8208;acetyl, O&#8208;lactyl, O&#8208;SO  3  , O&#8208;PO  3  . This synthetic pathway includes both an effective way to benzylate neuraminic acid derivatives, as well as a working methodology towards &#946;&#8208;linked neuraminic acid glycosides.</dc:description>

      <title>Stereocontrolled Synthesis of Harzialactone A and Its Three Stereoisomers by Use of Standardized Polyketide Building Blocks</title>
      <dc:description>
  The Harzialactone A synthesis utilizes a Horner&#8211;Wittig&#8208;reaction of the chiral building block and benzaldehyde in the first step. The formed &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketone can be selectively transformed into the syn&#8208; or anti&#8208;diol, which is further converted into the desired natural compound by ozonolysis, cyclization and oxidation in one step.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  In this paper, we present a short and convenient synthesis of the natural product Harzialactone A and its three stereoisomers. In a three&#8208;step synthesis starting from cheap and commercially available benzaldehyde, we created the small polyketidic compound with full control over its two stereogenic centers. To this end, we employed a chiral building block previously described by us, introducing the first stereogenic center through a Horner&#8211;Wittig reaction. The second stereogenic center was installed via stereocontrolled syn&#8208; or anti&#8208;reduction with the corresponding &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketone intermediates. Upon ozonolysis followed by oxidation the natural product and its stereovariants were produced with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereopurities.

      <title>Synthesis of Cycloheptatrienes, Oxepines, Thiepines and Silepines: A Comparison between Br&#248;nsted Acid and Au&#8208;catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>The cyclisation of 1&#8208;(benzyl&#8208;, oxyaryl&#8208;, thioaryl&#8208;, and silaaryl)&#8208;2&#8208;etynylbenzenes under Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208; and Au(I)&#8208;catalysis is described. Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis favours without exception the formation of the products derived from the regioselective protonation of the alkyne to generate the most stable vinyl carbocation intermediate. This determines the type of cyclisation following this initial step and therefore, the structure of the products. Contrarily, with only few exceptions, for example when the substrate contains a terminal alkyne moiety, Au&#8208;catalysis preferentially promotes the formation of seven membered rings via 7&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclisation. This reaction pathway is imposed even if a priori the natural electronic polarization in the substrates would suggest another operating mechanism. Making use of these reactivity patterns, a series of structurally differentiated dibenzo&#8208;cycloheptatrienes, &#8208;oxepines, &#8208;thiepines and &#8208;silepines have been synthesized with excellent yields and regioselectivities.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of seco&#8208;analogues of the DHCR24 inhibitor SH&#8208;42</title>
      <dc:description>In a project aimed at the further development of the potent steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory &#916;  24  &#8208;dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24) inhibitor SH&#8208;42 we worked out routes to ring B s  eco  &#8208;steroidal analogues.

As saturated analogues of the latter 4&#8208;(cyclohexylethyl)perhydroindanes were prepared.

      <title>Calcium carbide: versatile synthetic applications, green methodology and sustainability</title>
      <dc:description>Acetylene is a key building block for organic chemistry and potentially can be involved in a diverse range of synthetic transformations.

Safety limitations due to flammable and explosive nature of gaseous acetylene and requirements for specialized high&#8208;pressure equipment impose serious drawbacks.

      <title>Isomerisation of vinyl sulfones for the stereoselective synthesis of vinyl azides</title>
      <dc:description>Reported is the construction, and facile base&#8208;mediated conversation of ten differently substituted 3&#8208;azido E&#8208; vinyl sulfones (&#947;&#8208;azido&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated sulfones) into their isomeric vinyl azide counterparts. The requisite 3&#8208;azido E&#8208; vinyl sulfones were prepared from 3&#8208;bromo E&#8208; vinyl sulfones, which in turn were accessed from allyl sulfones via a bromination&#8208;elimination sequence. In relation to this a one&#8208;pot azidation&#8208;isomerisation sequence was developed which enabled the direct formation of the vinyl azides from the corresponding 3&#8208;bromo E&#8208; vinyl sulfones. Similarly, a convenient one&#8208;pot Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons olefination&#8208;isomerisation approach was utilised in order to prepare some of the allylic sulfones used in this study. The vinyl azide forming process typically proceeded with high levels of Z &#8208;selectivity, although this was dependent on the vinyl sulfone substitution pattern. Thus, with either no substituent or a methyl group in the &#947;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;position, relative to the sulfone, good, to high levels of Z &#8208;selectivity ( Z:E = 85:15 to &#8805;95:5) were obtained. However, incorporation of an &#945;&#8208;sulfonyl methyl substituent led to an E &#8208;selective process ( Z:E = 20:80). A non&#8208;bonding interaction between the azido group and the &#945;&#8208;sulfonyl vinylic proton is proposed, which acts as a conformational control mechanism to help guide the stereochemical outcome.</dc:description>

The Cover Feature shows that movement along a trajectory is regulated in dynamic rotaxane systems even by subtle steric changes imposed by varying incorporated amino acids in the molecular thread component.

      <title>Synthesis and Properties of Dibenzo[a,j]acridines</title>
      <dc:description>
  Dibenzo[a,j]acridines have been synthesized in three steps and high overall yields using a Br&#248;nsted acid mediated cycloisomerization as the final key step. Optical&#8208; and electrochemical properties have been studied by UV/Vis&#8208; and fluorescence spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  A convenient three&#8208;step synthesis of dibenzo[a,j]acridines is reported which relies on regioselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions of 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrachloropyridine and subsequent Br&#248;nsted acid mediated cycloisomerization. Products are obtained in good yields and the method is broadly applicable. For selected dibenzo[a,j]acridines, photophysical and electrochemical properties were studied.

      <title>Unveiling the Reactivity of Cyclic Azomethine Ylides in [3+2] Cycloaddition Reactions within the Molecular Electron Density Theory</title>
      <dc:description>The [3+2] cycloaddition (32CA) reactions of cyclic azomethine ylides with a series of acetylene derivatives have been studied within the Molecular Electron Density Theory (MEDT). Analysis of the Conceptual DFT indices allows characterising the ambiphilic character of these cyclic AYs, thus participating as strong electrophiles and strong nucleophiles in polar 32CA reactions. Analysis of the activation enthalpies associated with the 32CA reactions of these cyclic AYs are found in reasonable agreement with the experimental outcomes. These reactions take place  via  a one&#8208;step mechanism. The 32CA reactions with 1&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1&#8208;propyne and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate take place through highly asynchronous polar transition states (TSs). On the other hand, the strain present in cyclooctyne allows explaining its participation in a non&#8208;polar 32CA reaction  via  a synchronous TS. The present MEDT study allows establishing that the substitution in these cyclic AYs changes their parent  pseudodiradical&#8208;type  reactivity to the zwitterionic&#8208;type one.</dc:description>

      <title>Conformational Mobility and Efficiency in Supramolecular Catalysis. A Computational Approach to Evaluate the Performances of Enzyme Mimics.</title>
      <dc:description>In the present study, we apply a computational approach, based on DFT calculations and molecular dynamics simulations, to investigate the catalytic behavior of four supramolecular catalysts active in the cleavage of phosphodiesters. The QM data indicate the operation of a synchronous associative mechanism with limited differences in the structures and energies of the transition states. The comparison with the experimental data, expressed in terms of effective molarity (EM), suggests that the difference in catalytic performance are not ascribable to a difference in the enthalpy of activation. On the other hand, the analysis of the Molecular Dynamics trajectories clearly indicates the conformational mobility, and therefore the conformational entropy, to be at the origin of the superior catalytic efficiency of the catalysts based on a more preorganized structure. Essentially, the combined method presented here provides, at a limited computational cost, a tool that is simple, general, and potentially suited for a large variety of catalytic systems to rationalize their performances and to predict those of enzyme mimics to be synthesized in a rational design process.</dc:description>

The use of cesium carbonate as a catalyst and water as an effective additive, elimination of a transition&#8208;metal catalyst, reaction solvent and column chromatography separation led to an overall greener approach to access valuable benzyl azides in quantitative yields.

      <title>Consecutive oxidation/condensation/cyclization/aromatization sequences catalyzed by nanostructured iron(III)&#8208;porphyrin complex toward benzoxazole derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>A facile, efficient, and eco&#8208;friendly strategy to access benzoxazole heterocyclic products has been accomplished through oxidation of catechols followed by condensation/cyclization/aromatization sequences. This process is catalyzed by nanostructured iron(III)&#8208;porphyrin complex to form desired benzoxazole derivatives at room temperature under air condition. The procedure is widely applicable to diverse amines, and can provide the heterocyclic products in a scalable fashion, as well. One of the most significant types of oxidizing agents in nature is the iron&#8208;porphyrin complexes (0.1 mol%), existing in the structure of hemoglobin. They have benefits such as low toxicity and high oxidation potential for many substrates.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A facile, efficient, and eco&#8208;friendly strategy to access benzoxazole heterocyclic products has been accomplished through oxidation of catechols followed by condensation/cyclization/aromatization sequences. This process is catalyzed by nanostructured iron(III)&#8208;porphyrin complex to form desired benzoxazole derivatives at room temperature under air condition. The procedure is widely applicable to diverse amines, and can provide the heterocyclic products in a scalable fashion, as well. One of the most significant types of oxidizing agents in nature is the iron&#8208;porphyrin complexes (0.1 mol%), existing in the structure of hemoglobin. They have benefits such as low toxicity and high oxidation potential for many substrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Tetraaryl Cyclopentadienones: Experimental and Theoretical Insights into Negative Solvatochromism and Electrochemistry</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of a series of tetraaryl cyclopentadienones comprising different substitution patterns is reported. Their photophysical and electrochemical properties are investigated by UV/Vis spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry as well as by supporting quantum chemical simulations and reveal a distinct effect of substituents on the redox behavior of the molecules as well as the absorption properties of this class of compounds. While electrochemical data display a shift in reduction potential of up to 200 mV between the differently substituted cyclopentadienones, their photophysical investigations in differently polar solvents suggest a negative solvatochromic effect, although protic solvents induce a bathochromic shift.

      <title>Rhodium catalysts with a chiral cyclopentadienyl ligand derived from natural R&#8208;myrtenal</title>
      <dc:description>A new chiral cyclopentadiene CpmyrH was synthesized from the natural terpene  R&#8208;myrtenal in 5 steps and about 40% total yield. The key step was the reaction of vinyl&#8208;dibromocyclopropane derivative with MeLi which provided the diene CpmyrH via Skatteb&#248;l rearrangement. The reaction of Cpmyr  H with [(cod)Rh(OAc)]2  gave the rhodium(I) complex (Cpmyr)Rh(cod) and subsequent oxidation with halogens X2  gave the rhodium(III) complexes [(Cpmyr)RhX2]2  (X = Br, I). Complex (Cpmyr)Rh(cod) in combination with benzoyl peroxide catalyzed the C&#8208;H activation of O&#8208;pivaloyl&#8208;phenylhydroxamic acid and its subsequent annulation with alkenes giving dihydroisoquinolinones with high yield (70&#8722;90%) but moderate enantioselectivity (16&#8722;36% ee).</dc:description>

      <title>Reductive carbon&#8722;carbon bond forming reactions with carbonyls mediated by Rh&#8722;H complex</title>
      <dc:description>Carbon&#8722;carbon bond formation is a fundamental transformation of synthetic organic chemistry. This minireview focuses on our works related to reductive aldol reaction, reductive Mannich reaction, reductive &#945;&#8208;acylation, and reductive &#945;&#8208;carboxylation by using rhodium catalyst to achieve C&#8722;C bond formation. Rh&#8208;catalyzed reductive aldol reaction successfully gave &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carbonyl compounds from &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds with aldehydes or ketones by treating with RhCl(PPh  3  )  3  and Et  2  Zn. This condition could apply to other electrophiles such as imines, acid chlorides, and acid anhydrides, and the corresponding &#946;&#8208;lactams, or &#946;&#8208;ketocarbonyl compounds were obtained in good yields, respectively. A key intermediate, Rh&#8722;H complex would play an important role to accomplish 1,4&#8208;reduction, which could easily be derived from RhCl(PPh  3  )  3  and Et  2  Zn. The synthesis of a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ezetimibe, was also achieved by using Rh&#8208;catalyzed reductive Mannich reaction as an application. We expect that the reaction could be used in a wide range of fields by further development.</dc:description>

      <title>Selectivity in the Addition of Electron Deficient Radicals to the C2 Position of Indoles</title>
      <dc:description>The addition of electron deficient radicals to the  C2  position of indoles has been described in the literature as opposed to electrophilic addition at the  C  3 position. Density functional theory calculations were used to understand the switch in regioselectivity from  C3  to  C2  for indole to undergo radical additions. Electron deficient radicals have a lower barrier for reaction at  C  2 and a lower energy radical intermediate that benefits from benzylic radical stabilization.

      <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Arylations of Heteroarenes with Polyfluoroalkoxy&#8208;Substituted Bromobenzenes</title>
      <dc:description>
  Di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;fluoroalkoxy&#8208;substituted bromobenzenes were successfully employed in the direct arylation of 5&#8208;membered ring heteroarenes using Pd&#8208;catalysis. The use of these polyfluoroalkoxy&#8208;substituted bromobenzenes in direct arylation is simpler than the use of bromophenols, as they display a higher reactivity, and as there is no need to introduce a polyfluoroalkyl group to obtain the (polyfluoroalkoxy)benzenes.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The reactivity of di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;fluoroalkoxy&#8208;substituted bromobenzenes in the direct arylation of 5&#8208;membered ring heteroarenes using palladium catalysis was explored. High yields in arylated heteroarenes were obtained using only 1 mol&#8208;% of Pd(OAc)2 catalyst with KOAc as an inexpensive base. Similar yields were obtained with o/m/p trifluoromethoxy&#8208;, o/p difluoromethoxy&#8208;, and tetrafluoroethoxy&#8208;substituents on the aryl bromide. A bromo&#8208;substituted difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxole was successfully coupled. The major side&#8208;products of the reaction are HBr/KOAc. Therefore, this synthetic scheme is very attractive for the access to such polyfluoroalkoxy&#8208;containing arylated heteroaromatics in terms of cost, simplicity, and low environmental impact, compared to reactions involving arylation of heteroarenes with bromophenols followed by polyfluoroalkylation.

     alt="Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Arylations of Heteroarenes with Polyfluoroalkoxy&#8208;Substituted Bromobenzenes"/&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;fluoroalkoxy&#8208;substituted bromobenzenes were successfully employed in the direct arylation of 5&#8208;membered ring heteroarenes using Pd&#8208;catalysis. The use of these polyfluoroalkoxy&#8208;substituted bromobenzenes in direct arylation is simpler than the use of bromophenols, as they display a higher reactivity, and as there is no need to introduce a polyfluoroalkyl group to obtain the (polyfluoroalkoxy)benzenes.
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The reactivity of di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;fluoroalkoxy&#8208;substituted bromobenzenes in the direct arylation of 5&#8208;membered ring heteroarenes using palladium catalysis was explored. High yields in arylated heteroarenes were obtained using only 1 mol&#8208;% of Pd(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst with KOAc as an inexpensive base. Similar yields were obtained with &lt;i&gt;o/m/p&lt;/i&gt; trifluoromethoxy&#8208;, &lt;i&gt;o/p&lt;/i&gt; difluoromethoxy&#8208;, and tetrafluoroethoxy&#8208;substituents on the aryl bromide. A bromo&#8208;substituted difluorobenzo[&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;][1,3]dioxole was successfully coupled. The major side&#8208;products of the reaction are HBr/KOAc. Therefore, this synthetic scheme is very attractive for the access to such polyfluoroalkoxy&#8208;containing arylated heteroaromatics in terms of cost, simplicity, and low environmental impact, compared to reactions involving arylation of heteroarenes with bromophenols followed by polyfluoroalkylation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Investigation of Straightforward, Photoinduced Alkylations of Electron&#8208;Rich Heterocompounds with Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkyl Bromides in the Sole Presence of 2,6&#8208;Lutidine</title>
      <dc:description>
  No need for a complex photosensitizer: We introduce a method for selective photoinduced alkylations of electron&#8208;rich heterocompounds with electron&#8208;deficient allyl bromides in the presence of 2,6&#8208;lutidine at 365 or 405 nm. Mechanistic investigations reveal that a colored intermediate formed from 2,6&#8208;lutidine and alkyl bromide is involved in the photoactivation. Our approach uses commercially available reagents and a straightforward protocol.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Alkylations of simple electron&#8208;rich heterocompounds deliver valuable target structures in bioorganic and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we present a straightforward and photosensitizer free approach for the photoinduced C&#8211;C coupling of electron&#8208;rich unsaturated heterocompounds with alkyl bromides using 405 nm and 365 nm irradiation. Comprehensive mechanistic studies indicate the involvement of 2,6&#8208;lutidine in the formation of a non&#8208;covalently bound intermediate to which the function of a photosensitizer is attributed. UV/Vis spectra reveal the formation of a bathochromic shifted band when the electron&#8208;deficient alkyl bromide is mixed with the structural motif of 2,6&#8208;substituted pyridine. Upon photochemical excitation of this band, we find the initiation of the C&#8211;C bond&#8208;forming reaction. Using this approach highly versatile alkylation products, e.g. &#945;&#8208;substituted ketones and 2&#8208;substituted furan, thiophene, and pyrrole derivatives, are obtained in high selectivity. Furthermore, this synthetic methodology can be applied to access substituted indoles, which cannot be obtained by other transformations.

      <title>Mild Deprotection of Dithioacetals by TMSCl/NaI Association in CH3CN</title>
      <dc:description>
  TMSCl associated with NaI was used to deprotect various dithioacetals in CH3CN with good to excellent yields. This metal&#8208;free process can also be applied with success for the regeneration of carbonyl of O,O&#8208;acetals, O,S&#8208;oxathianes, S,N&#8208;acetals, ketimines, and hydrazones.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  A mild process using a combination of TMSCl and NaI in acetonitrile is used to regenerate carbonyl compounds from a variety of dithiane and dithiolane derivatives. This easy to handle and inexpensive protocol is also efficient to deprotect oxygenated and mixed acetals as 1,3&#8208;dioxanes, 1,3&#8208;dioxolanes and 1,3&#8208;oxathianes quantitatively. As a possible extension of this method, it was also shown that nitrogenated substrates such as hydrazones, N&#8208;tosylhydrazones, and ketimines reacted well under these conditions to give the expected ketones in high yields. The methodology proposed herein is a good alternative to the existing methods since it does not use metals, oxidants, reducing agents, acidic or basic media, and keto&#8208;products were obtained in high to excellent yields.

      <title>A Decade of Muricatacin Synthesis and Beyond</title>
      <dc:description>
  Various syntheses of both the muricatacin enantiomers and analogues adopting different strategies in the last decade are described in this review. Additionaly, the strategic use of muricatacin as starting point in synthesis of reticulatacin, cis&#8208;solamins and giganin is covered.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  In this review, we have abstracted the various syntheses of both enantiomers of muricatacin (a member of a bigger class of acetogenins, ACGs), over the last decade (2010&#8211;2020). Developments in the synthesis of various epimers, homologues, oxa&#8208;analogues, &#948;&#8208;lactones, and the furofuranone analogues are also enfolded in this review. Most of the synthesis involve chiral pool and catalytic enantioselective approaches, while a few are hinged on the use of chiral auxiliary and resolution methods. Muricatacin with orthogonally differentiated two oxy&#8208;functions also serve as a start point in the synthesis of higher molecules of the acetogenin family, for example, cis&#8208;solamins, and these have also been covered herein.

      <title>One&#8208;Electron Reduction of Redox&#8208;Active Esters to Generate Carbon&#8208;Centered Radicals</title>
      <dc:description>
  Radical decarboxylative functionalization of redox&#8208;active esters induced by one&#8208;electron reductions (OER) has recently become a research focus in synthetic chemistry. Here we present the new advances using redox&#8208;active esters as carbon&#8208;centered radical precursors to form carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  The one&#8208;electron reduction (OER) can profoundly affect the structure and reactivity of organic compounds. OER induced radical decarboxylative functionalizations of redox&#8208;active esters have gained wide concerns in this century. In this review, we present recent advances using redox&#8208;active esters as carbon&#8208;centered radical precursors to form carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds.

      <title>Mechanism and Regioselectivity of Intramolecular [2+2] Cycloaddition of Ene&#8211;Ketenes: A DFT Study</title>
      <dc:description>Intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of ene&#8211;ketenes gives either fused&#8208;ring (via normal [2+2] cycloaddition) or bridged&#8208;ring (via cross&#8208;[2+2] cycloaddition) cyclobutanones. For example, terminal ene&#8211;ketenes give the fused&#8208;ring cycloadducts, whereas dimethyl&#8208;substituted ene&#8211;ketenes furnish bridged&#8208;ring cycloadducts. For monomethyl&#8208;substituted ene&#8211;ketenes, both [2+2] cycloadducts are generated. However, there are no systematic theoretical studies on such a regiochemistry in the literature. Here we report our DFT study on the mechanism and regioselectivity of these intramolecular [2+2] cycloadditions. DFT calculations reveal that both normal and cross&#8208;[2+2] cycloadditions are concerted processes. The normal [2+2] cycloaddition transition state is forming an internal carbocation while the cross&#8208;[2+2] cycloaddition transition state is generating an external carbocation (see  Scheme 1  of the paper). On the basis of the relative stability of these carbocations, which is affected by both the tether and the substituent(s) on the alkene, a regiochemistry prediction model is proposed to understand and predict the reaction outcome.</dc:description>

      <title>From Natural Compounds to Bioactive Molecules through NMR and In Silico Methodologies</title>
      <dc:description>
  Natural products are a privileged class of compounds with high diversity which are suitable for inspiring new rationally designed multi&#8208;target drugs. Herein, a multi&#8208;disciplinary approach that covers the structural and pharmacological characterization of NPs for developing semisynthetic and synthetic derivatives with optimized potency/selectivity towards specific targets in the inflammatory/cancer field is proposed.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Marine and terrestrial organisms are an unlimited source of active secondary metabolites. They are characterized by high chemical diversity, biochemical specificity, and other molecular features that make them a valid starting point for lead generation in the drug discovery process. Considering the complex structural architecture and the high number of stereogenic centers, compared to the synthetic drugs, the elucidation of the 2D structure and the assessment of the precise 3D arrangements of natural products (NPs) provide essential insights into ligand&#8208;target interaction which can drive a rational lead optimization process. In this regard, the combination of NMR spectroscopy with modern computational techniques represents one of the most effective approaches to achieve this task. The DFT/NMR integrated method, and its application, in combination with the accurate ROE&#8208;distance analysis, have been employed as valid support, both to clarify the configuration and conformational profile of the active secondary metabolites and to shed more light on the molecular basis of their mechanism of action. Indeed, the comprehension at a molecular level of their interactions with specific targets involved in pathologies, like inflammation and cancer, represents a cornerstone for further investigations through computational tools like molecular docking and molecular dynamics. These high&#8208;efficiency in silico techniques play a crucial part in the drug discovery process as well as in lead optimization procedures. Furthermore, this integrated approach provides the identification of novel chemical platforms disclosing new bioactive molecules with enhanced potency and selectivity.

  Low molecular weight di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetrapeptide transmembrane ion transporters containing aminobenzoic acid and l/d alanine are reported. These short peptides transport alkali metal cations in preference to halides across the lipid bilayer most likely through a carrier mechanism. Easy access to these peptides and the ability to install diverse functional groups into the peptidic scaffold make them attractive scaffolds for therapeutic use.

      <title>Advances in N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis for Natural Product Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>
  This Minireview gives an overview of the four important intermediates generated in N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis that have been applied in the total synthesis of natural products: Breslow intermediates, homoenolates, enolates, and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl azoliums.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) efficiently catalyze new bond formations with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity through umpolung and non&#8208;umpolung processes. These processes typically involve four species: Breslow intermediates, homoenolates, enolates, and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl azoliums. Organic syntheses are increasingly relying on NHC catalysis, and this minireview highlights developments in NHC&#8208;catalyzed reactions that, over the past two decades, have been used as key steps in the total syntheses of natural products. Crucial intermediates and reaction mechanisms are presented in detail.

      <title>Copper&#8208;Promoted N&#8208;Arylation of the Indole Side Chain of Tryptophan Using Triarylbismuthines</title>
      <dc:description>
  A simple protocol for the regioselective N&#8208;arylation of the indole side chain of tryptophan using triarylbismuth reagents as the arylating agent is reported. The reaction is catalyzed by copper(II) acetate in the presence of an organic base. The protocol allows the installation of electron rich or poor aryl groups with substituents at any position, shows excellent scope and functional group compatibility, and retains the integrity of the stereogenic center.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  A simple protocol for the regioselective N&#8208;arylation of the indole side chain of tryptophan using triarylbismuth reagents as the arylating agent is reported. The reaction is catalyzed by copper(II) acetate, and operates in the presence of triethylamine or pyridine under air at 50 &#176;C. This reaction allows the transfer of aryl groups bearing electron neutral, donating or withdrawing substituents at any position of the ring, shows high functional group tolerance, and retains the integrity of the stereogenic center. The protocol was utilized to N&#8208;arylate tryptophan&#8208;containing di&#8208; and tripeptides.

      <title>Applications of Chiral Cyclopentadienyl (Cpx) Metal Complexes in Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Metal complexes containing cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ligands are versatile and robust catalysts widely applied in organic synthesis. During the last two decades chiral Cpx complexes have been applied in a variety of enantioselective transformations.

Several ligand designs have successfully been used in a diverse array of reactions, in particular C&#8208;H functionalisations, with binaphthyl&#8208;derived ligands leading the field. Challenges with these ligands derive from the need for their multi&#8208;step synthesis, and recently new ligands have been designed which can be accessed in shorter sequences from readily available starting materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Regioselective Olefination of 3&#8208;Substituted Five&#8208;Membered Heteroarenes</title>
      <dc:description>
  Achieving site selectivity in the olefination of heteroarenes constitutes a highly attractive yet often challenging synthetic target. Herein we discuss the development of catalyst systems for the regioselective functionalization of 3&#8208;substituted five&#8208;membered heteroarenes, which constitute particularly challenging substrates due to competing effects favoring different positions and are therefore attractive systems to prove strategies in catalyst design.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Five&#8208;membered heteroarenes constitute ubiquitous moieties in bioactive compounds and materials. It is thus not surprising that a direct and selective access to multiply substituted heteroarenes is considered as a highly attractive synthetic target. The direct olefination of such substrates, also known as cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling has raised significant interest in this context. However, achieving site&#8208;selectivity remains challenging with some substitution patterns such as 3&#8208;substituted heteroarenes. Suitable catalyst systems and reaction conditions have to be identified, which enable the differentiation between the competing C2&#8208; and C5&#8208;position. Over the last few years, substantial progress has been made to overcome this selectivity challenge mainly based on the use of novel ligand systems, which will be described herein.

      <dc:description>Carbohydrate based ionic liquids (CHILs) are a sub&#8208;class of ionic liquids which first emerged in 2007 and has since then attracted a steadily growing community of organic chemists. Since carbohydrates are naturally occurring materials with a broad spectrum of diastereomers, they are fitting materials for ionic liquids bearing stereochemical information.

      <title>An Alternative Approach to the Hydrated Imidazoline Ring Expansion (HIRE) of Diarene&#8208;Fused [1.4]Oxazepines</title>
      <dc:description>
  A new approach to the synthesis of 10&#8208; and 11&#8208;membered lactams via hydrated imidazoline ring expansion is described. In addition to the ring expansion an alternative course of the hydrated imidazoline evolution was discovered, for the first time, which gave N&#8208;aminoethyl derivatives.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  A four&#8208;step approach to the &#8220;hydrated imidazoline ring expansion&#8221; (HIRE) is presented. In most cases, the ring expansion was the sole process. However, for the first time, an alternative course of the hydrated imidazoline evolution was discovered which gave N&#8208;aminoethyl derivatives. These can, in principle, be converted into the target HIRE products under sufficiently forcing conditions. The approach offers improved flexibility with respect to the peripheral substituents and is also applicable to the synthesis of eleven&#8208;membered lactams. We observed that the latter can exist in two stable isomeric forms due to lactam&#8211;amide bond isomerization. The latter finding further demonstrates the value of medium&#8208;sized rings as multiple&#8208;conformer probes for biological target interrogation.

      <title>Application of Chiral Sulfinamides into Formation and Reduction of Sulfinylketimines to Obtain Valuable &#945;&#8208;Chiral Primary Amines</title>
      <dc:description>
  This minireview focuses on the use of sulfinamides as chiral auxiliaries in a condensation/reduction process to give access to &#945;&#8208;chiral primary amines. This paper gives an overview of all the methodologies developed around this process including metal hydride and transition metal reduction reactions, and of the application of these methodologies for the synthesis of valuable biologically active chiral compounds.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  Chiral sulfinamides are very valuable, commercially available, and easy to handle chiral auxiliaries. One of the most interesting transformations that can be performed with a chiral sulfinamide is its condensation onto a ketone to form a chiral sulfinylketimine, followed by a reduction to obtain an &#945;&#8208;chiral primary amine. We review here all the methodologies developed around this condensation/reduction transformation. In the second part, we survey applications of these newly developed methodologies for the synthesis of valuable biologically active compounds, including multikilogram scale synthesis.
