         <title>Hazelnut: Explorations toward the Biocatalytic Synthesis of its Aroma Precursor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article proposes a biosynthetic route for synthesizing filbertone, the principal flavor compound of hazelnut, through a multienzyme cascade. The pathway uses D&#8208;amino acid oxidase, threonine deaminase, and a regioselective transketolase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus to produce a sustainable, natural hazelnut aroma precursor, addressing industrial demands for regulated natural compounds.

Biocatalysis gains significant industrial interest due to its controlled stereoselectivity and use of mild process conditions. Here, a biosynthetic route is proposed for the synthesis of filbertone (5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;hepten&#8208;4&#8208;one, 1), which is the principal flavor compound of hazelnut. The enantiomeric purity of the industrially synthesized compound is defined, contrary to the natural aroma, which varies according to the source of the nut, extraction conditions, and treatments. The novel synthetic pathway for a hazelnut aroma precursor proposed here consists of a multienzyme cascade, which starts from the two amino acids D&#8208;Ile and L&#8208;Thr that are individually converted by enzyme catalysts, i.e., D&#8208;amino acid oxidase and threonine deaminase, followed by C&#63743;C ligation of the obtained products, allowing a potentially sustainable production of the natural aroma. The most critical step is C&#63743;C ligation, which uses two carbonyl compounds as starting material. This step is catalyzed by a regioselective transketolase (TK) that originates from Geobacillus stearothermophilus. The approach holds promise for the industrial production of natural hazelnut aroma precursors, addressing the growing demand in the aroma industry for synthesis methods that sustain the regulatory claims for natural compounds.

         <title>Beyond FimH: Diversity and Relevance of Carbohydrate&#8208;Binding Fimbrial Proteins in Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses fimbrial lectins found in Escherichia coli (E. coli) other than FimH, which could be targeted to treat E. coli pathogenicity as an alternative to antibiotic treatment.

Escherichia coli (E. coli) is responsible for multiple diseases in humans and animals. Many of them are treated with antibiotics; however, the need for new therapies has led to research in alternative treatments. One such approach involves preventing the adherence of E. coli to host cells by inhibiting their adhesins. Adherence is a crucial step of pathogenesis, and bacterial lectins that recognize host glycans play major roles in host cell adhesion. In fact, lectins are the most common bacterial adhesins. The various pathogenic and nonpathogenic E. coli strains express a multitude of lectins, many of which are found on E. coli fimbriae. Current research on lectin inhibition using glycomimetics has produced many mannose&#8208;based inhibitors of the uropathogenic E. coli fimbrial lectin FimH. However, only a limited number of synthetic inhibitors are reported for other lectins. In this review, many other cell surface adhesins of E. coli are discussed, focusing on fimbrial lectins. The types of E. coli strains they are found in, their carbohydrate targets, and their binding sites are also discussed. This review aims to highlight the many lectins that can become therapeutic targets to treat E. coli infections in addition to FimH.

         <title>Selective Lysine Ubiquitination Using Activated Phenol Esters</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ubiquitination of both peptides and proteins using a novel water&#8208;soluble acylation reagent, based on a 2,4&#8208;dichloro&#8208;6&#8208;sulfonic acid phenol ester, is presented. At alkaline pH, fast lysine ubiquitination is observed on model peptide FLYRANK, and its regioselectivity is confirmed using controls. The same selective lysine ubiquitination is shown on the Fau gene encoded Ubiquitin&#8208;like protein (FUBI) protein, which is confirmed using liquid chromatography tandem mass&#8208;spectrometry analysis/mass spectrometry analysis.

Ubiquitination of target proteins is an essential post&#8208;translational modification influencing a wide variety of cellular processes. Herein, the use of a novel water&#8208;soluble acylation reagent based on the 2,4&#8208;dichloro&#8208;6&#8208;sulfonic acid phenol ester of ubiquitin is described for efficient and selective ubiquitin modification of peptides. Under alkaline conditions, this reagent is swift and regioselective toward lysine acylation, while at neutral pH it shows loss of regioselectivity and is able to acylate both lysine and N&#8208;terminal modification at reduced speeds. As proof of concept, a model peptide is utilized to demonstrate this strategy, proving to be successful. Then the ubiquitination of a synthetic protein called Fau gene encoded Ubiquitin&#8208;like protein (FUBI) is performed under alkaline conditions followed by tandem MS analysis, proving that the selective lysine ubiquitination works to prepare protein&#8211;protein conjugates.

         <title>Regulation of Gene Expression of Mouse D&#8208;Amino Acid Oxidase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover illustration shows the transcriptional regulation of the mouse D&#8208;amino acid oxidase (DAO) gene. Key TFs act on the core promoter to stimulate DAO expression, leading to D&#8208;serine metabolism and influencing neurotransmission. This reflects the study's discovery of conserved regulatory elements in DAO gene control.

D&#8208;amino acid oxidase (DAO) catalyzes oxidative deamination of D&#8208;amino acids, producing 2&#8208;oxo acids, hydrogen peroxide, and ammonia. In mammals, DAO is essential for metabolizing both endogenous and exogenous D&#8208;amino acids. Previous studies on human DAO identify two promoter regions (P1 and P2), a negative regulatory element in intron 1, and several transcription factor (TF) binding sites. In this study, the regulatory mechanism of mouse DAO gene expression is investigated to compare with the human system. To determine the promoter activity in the upstream region of the initiation site, plasmids containing mouse DAO gene fragments inserted into the pGL4 [luc2P/Hygro] vector and assessed luciferase activity in LLC&#8208;PK1 cells are constructed. A series of deletion constructs is analyzed, revealing promoter activity in all tested fragments. The highest promoter activity is detected in the &#8722;333/&#8722;87 subregion, with residual activities in the &#8722;87/&#8201;+&#8201;111 region. Bioinformatics analysis identifies TFs, including NEUR, EGRF, ZF07, ZF11, KLFS, SP1F, and ZF02, which bind to both the human and mouse DAO genes at conserved positions, suggesting their critical role in regulating DAO promoter activity.

         <title>Structures of &#8220;Tyrosine&#8208;IRED&#8221; IR91 from Kribbella flavida in Complex with a Reductive Amination Substrate and Product</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure of the (S)&#8208;selective &#8220;tyrosine&#8221; imine reductase (IRED) IR91 from Kribbella flavida is presented in complex with its ketone substrate and (S)&#8208;amine product, revealing for the first time the interactions of substrate and product with an IRED of this type acting in a reductive aminase mode.

Imine reductases with an (S)&#8208;preference for the reduction of the model substrate 2&#8208;methyl pyrroline typically contain tyrosine in the active site (Y&#8208;IREDs) instead of the aspartate present within (R)&#8208;selective enzymes (D&#8208;IREDs). As with D&#8208;IREDs, a subset of Y&#8208;IREDs is capable of enabling reductive amination reactions between some ketone and amine partners to give optically active amines with high optical purity. However, structures of Y&#8208;IREDs in complex with the substrates and products of the reductive amination have not been forthcoming. Herein, structures of the Y&#8208;IRED IR91 from Kribbella flavida in complex with 5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2&#8208;tetralone, a synthetic precursor to the anti&#8208;Parkinson's treatment rotigotine, and also its reductive amination product with methylamine, 5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;(S)&#8208;2&#8208;(N&#8208;methylamino)&#8208;tetralin, are presented. The structures, in combination with mutation and kinetic studies, support a role for tryptophan residue W258 in the activity of the enzyme, possibly in binding of the ketone prior to reaction with methylamine.

&lt;p&gt;The structure of the (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-selective &#8220;tyrosine&#8221; imine reductase (IRED) IR91 from &lt;i&gt;Kribbella flavida&lt;/i&gt; is presented in complex with its ketone substrate and (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-amine product, revealing for the first time the interactions of substrate and product with an IRED of this type acting in a reductive aminase mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imine reductases with an (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-preference for the reduction of the model substrate 2-methyl pyrroline typically contain tyrosine in the active site (Y-IREDs) instead of the aspartate present within (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-selective enzymes (D-IREDs). As with D-IREDs, a subset of Y-IREDs is capable of enabling reductive amination reactions between some ketone and amine partners to give optically active amines with high optical purity. However, structures of Y-IREDs in complex with the substrates and products of the reductive amination have not been forthcoming. Herein, structures of the Y-IRED IR91 from &lt;i&gt;Kribbella flavida&lt;/i&gt; in complex with 5-methoxy-2-tetralone, a synthetic precursor to the anti-Parkinson's treatment rotigotine, and also its reductive amination product with methylamine, 5-methoxy-(&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-2-(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylamino)-tetralin, are presented. The structures, in combination with mutation and kinetic studies, support a role for tryptophan residue W258 in the activity of the enzyme, possibly in binding of the ketone prior to reaction with methylamine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development and Recent Advances in SLIPT&#8208;PM: A Chemogenetic Platform for Manipulating Signaling at the Plasma Membrane</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SLIPT&#8208;PM enables the translocation of tag&#8208;fused proteins from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane using a synthetic self&#8208;localizing ligand. This user&#8208;friendly system permits reversible control of diverse signaling pathways. This concept article highlights the key features and current applications of SLIPT&#8208;PM as a powerful tool in chemical and synthetic biology.

Upon cell stimulation, mammalian cells activate various signaling proteins and lipids by recruiting their upstream regulators to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (PM), which in turn determines their cellular response. Therefore, artificially inducing protein translocation to the PM is an effective strategy for dissecting cell signaling networks and engineering cellular functions. Self&#8208;localizing ligand&#8208;induced protein translocation (SLIPT) is an emerging technique that we developed to control protein localization in living cells using synthetic self&#8208;localizing ligands (SLs). Building on this strategy, we recently introduced a versatile chemogenetic SLIPT platform that rapidly recruits proteins of interest fused to an engineered Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase tag from the cytoplasm to the PM using a trimethoprim&#8208;based SL. The PM&#8208;specific SLIPT (SLIPT&#8208;PM) system is easy to use and enables researchers to manipulate diverse intracellular signaling molecules and pathways with controlled reversibility and repeatability. Owing to its modular design, related SLIPT&#8208;PM tools have also been developed to support more sophisticated experiments, such as light&#8208;induced spatially regulated protein recruitment and multiplexed signal manipulation. In this concept article, we review the development, principal features, current applications, and future challenges of SLIPT&#8208;PM as a unique tool in chemical biology and synthetic biology.

         <title>Amphiphilicity to &#945;/&#947; Hybrid Foldamers through Post&#8208;Modification at Multiple Sites: Antimicrobial Design and Structure&#8208;Function Relationship</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current work illustrates a cost&#8208;effective post&#8208;modification approach using artificial peptides to generate synthetic oligomers as antimicrobial agents. The peptides against the ESKAP panel of bacterial strains showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, and structure&#8208;function relationship studies were conducted considering parameters, such as charge and nature of hydrophilic and hydrophobic side chains.

Antimicrobial drug design is an active area of research. Drug resistance in microorganisms to conventional antibiotics imposes a huge burden on the healthcare and economy worldwide. Understanding the structural parameters controlling the antimicrobial activity enables researchers to develop effective antimicrobial agents. Post&#8208;modification of artificial peptides as a method to introduce amphiphilicity, a structural parameter to exhibit antimicrobial activity, is described in the current work. Using two hybrid sequences composed of 5&#8208;amino salicylic acid and natural amino acid leucine (Leu) or phenylalanine (Phe), the approach enabled us to prepare peptides varying in chain length, charge, and cationic groups. The peptides against the ESKAP panel of bacterial pathogens showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. The structure&#8208;function relationship indicated that antimicrobial activity varied with chain length, and the peptides composed of Leu residues were more effective than peptides with Phe residues. The late&#8208;stage modification and functional diversification can be done at a large scale, and the approach simplifies the synthesis and reduces the cost of production.

         <title>The Evolution of AChE Inhibitors in Alzheimer's Disease: From Single&#8208;Target to Multi&#8208;Target Ligands</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into the design and development of multi&#8208;target directed ligands (MTDLs) as innovative solutions for Alzheimer's disease (AD). It highlights the multifaceted nature of AD pathology, current therapeutic limitations, and how MTDLs, through merged or linked pharmacophores, can target multiple pathways such as amyloid&#8208;&#946; aggregation, tau hyperphosphorylation, and cholinergic dysfunction to advance anti&#8208;AD drug discovery.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease marked by cognitive decline, neuronal degeneration, and the accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, extracellular amyloid plaques, and neuroinflammation. Current treatment strategies, such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) and N&#8208;methyl&#8208;D&#8208;aspartate receptor antagonists, offer symptomatic relief but fail to stop disease progression. The development of multi&#8208;target&#8208;directed ligands (MTDLs) has gained attention as a method to address the complex pathology of AD. This review provides a detailed account of the journey of AChE inhibitors from single&#8208;target ligands to MTDLs, emphasizing the structural changes that improve target specificity, blood&#8211;brain barrier penetration, and therapeutic impact. By exploring these advancements, the review highlights the potential of MTDLs to overcome the limitations of traditional single&#8208;target approaches and contribute to the discovery of more effective anti&#8208;Alzheimer therapies along with discussing potential pitfalls.

         <title>Activity Analysis of the P2X Receptor Antagonist PPADS against Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The P2X receptor antagonist PPADS possesses activity against members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors, in particular STAT4, STAT5a, and STAT5b. PPADS protects STAT4 and STAT5a/STAT5b from thermal degradation in cell lysates to a higher extent than STAT3. The data suggest that aromatic disulfonate antagonists of P2X receptors may represent promising starting points for the development of inhibitors of STAT proteins.

The small molecule PPADS is a P2X receptor antagonist. Analysis of a library of known bioactive compounds in competitive fluorescence polarization&#8208;based assays indicates that PPADS and its isomer iso&#8208;PPADS also possess activity against members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors, in particular STAT4, STAT5a, and STAT5b. These results are also supported by HTRF assays. PPADS protects STAT4 and STAT5a/STAT5b from thermal degradation in cell lysates to a higher extent than STAT3. Combined data from this article and a previous article suggest that aromatic disulfonate antagonists of P2X receptors might serve as promising starting points for the development of inhibitors of STAT proteins.

         <title>Dominant&#8208;Negative Effects of p53 R337 Variants in Li&#8211;Fraumeni Syndrome: Impact on Tetramer Formation and Transcriptional Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hetero&#8208;tetramer dysfunction: Li&#8211;Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a hereditary cancer predisposition caused by mutations in the TP53 gene encoding the tumor suppressor p53. It is shown that p53 variants R337C and R337H, found in LFS, impair wild&#8208;type (WT) p53 function by forming heterotetramers with reduced transcriptional activity. This dominant&#8208;negative&#8208;like effect may explain tissue&#8208;specific tumor susceptibility in LFS.

Li&#8211;Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an inherited cancer predisposition disorder caused by heterozygous TP53 mutations. Among these, missense mutations at Arg337&#8212;such as R337C and R337H&#8212;are common in LFS patients. Although many studies have characterized individual p53 variants in LFS, the impact of tetramerization domain (TD) mutations on wild&#8208;type (WT) p53 function remains unclear. Herein, a novel FRET&#8208;based assay system that enables the simultaneous detection of heterotetramer formation and p53&#8208;dependent transcriptional activity in live cells is developed. These results show that the heteromultimerization of the R337C variant with WT p53 is only slightly reduced compared to WT homotetramers, yet its transcriptional activity is diminished by over 50%. In contrast, the R337H variant forms heterotetramers at near&#8208;normal levels but exhibits markedly compromised transcriptional activity. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized dominant&#8208;negative&#8208;like effect, suggesting reduced p53 function is due not only to decreased tetramer formation but also to diminished heterotetramer stability. Moreover, the LFS&#8208;associated p53TD variants show a greater loss of activity against the low&#8208;affinity, apoptosis&#8208;inducing bax response element than against the high&#8208;affinity, cell cycle arrest&#8208;related CDKN1A response element. Collectively, this study demonstrates that p53TD mutations can exert dominant&#8208;negative effects, advancing the understanding of p53 heteromultimer function in LFS pathogenesis. These mechanistic insights into p53 heterotetramer stability may not only inform genetic screening strategies for LFS but also support future therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring p53 function by stabilizing mutant tetramers.

     alt="Dominant-Negative Effects of p53 R337 Variants in Li&#8211;Fraumeni Syndrome: Impact on Tetramer Formation and Transcriptional Activity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hetero-tetramer dysfunction:&lt;/i&gt; Li&#8211;Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a hereditary cancer predisposition caused by mutations in the &lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt; gene encoding the tumor suppressor p53. It is shown that p53 variants R337C and R337H, found in LFS, impair wild-type (WT) p53 function by forming heterotetramers with reduced transcriptional activity. This dominant-negative-like effect may explain tissue-specific tumor susceptibility in LFS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li&#8211;Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an inherited cancer predisposition disorder caused by heterozygous &lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt; mutations. Among these, missense mutations at Arg337&#8212;such as R337C and R337H&#8212;are common in LFS patients. Although many studies have characterized individual p53 variants in LFS, the impact of tetramerization domain (TD) mutations on wild-type (WT) p53 function remains unclear. Herein, a novel FRET-based assay system that enables the simultaneous detection of heterotetramer formation and p53-dependent transcriptional activity in live cells is developed. These results show that the heteromultimerization of the R337C variant with WT p53 is only slightly reduced compared to WT homotetramers, yet its transcriptional activity is diminished by over 50%. In contrast, the R337H variant forms heterotetramers at near-normal levels but exhibits markedly compromised transcriptional activity. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized dominant-negative-like effect, suggesting reduced p53 function is due not only to decreased tetramer formation but also to diminished heterotetramer stability. Moreover, the LFS-associated p53TD variants show a greater loss of activity against the low-affinity, apoptosis-inducing &lt;i&gt;bax&lt;/i&gt; response element than against the high-affinity, cell cycle arrest-related &lt;i&gt;CDKN1A&lt;/i&gt; response element. Collectively, this study demonstrates that p53TD mutations can exert dominant-negative effects, advancing the understanding of p53 heteromultimer function in LFS pathogenesis. These mechanistic insights into p53 heterotetramer stability may not only inform genetic screening strategies for LFS but also support future therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring p53 function by stabilizing mutant tetramers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Cannabidiol and its Unnatural Enantiomer to Evaluate Anxiolytic&#8208;Like Properties and Memory Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both (&#8722;)&#8208; and (+)&#8208;cannabidiol (CBD and ent&#8208;CBD, respectively) are synthesized via a highly diastereoselective CSA&#8208;catalyzed Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction. ent&#8208;CBD exhibits anxiolytic&#8208;like effects in aged male mice without impairing long&#8208;term memory formation.

(&#8722;)&#8208;Cannabidiol (CBD) is a nonpsychotropic phytocannabinoid found in Cannabis strains with well&#8208;established pharmacological applications. Conversely, (+)&#8208;cannabidiol (ent&#8208;CBD), the non&#8208;natural enantiomer of CBD, has been involved in a limited number of pharmacological studies. Therefore, CBD and ent&#8208;CBD are synthesized using (R)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;carvone as starting materials, respectively, via a highly diastereoselective 10&#8208;camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) catalyzed Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction as the key step. Pharmacological studies are conducted using the plus&#8208;maze discriminative avoidance task (PM&#8208;DAT) to evaluate the interaction between memory and anxiety&#8208;like behavior as well as spontaneous motor activity in both young adult and aged male mice. The results show that ent&#8208;CBD at a dose of 20&#8201;mg&#8201;kg&#8722;1 has an anxiolytic&#8208;like effect in aged male mice. In addition, ent&#8208;CBD did not impair discriminative avoidance memory formation at all doses evaluated.

Quantification of Small Molecule Partitioning in a Biomolecular Condensate with 2D Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several intrinsically disordered proteins have been shown to undergo phase separation and it is highly relevant to know how small molecule metabolites distribute between these phases. It is shown here that the partitioning can be robustly obtained from 2D time&#8208;zero heteronuclear single quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance spectra recorded on the dilute and dense phases separately.

Several intrinsically disordered proteins have been shown to undergo phase separation into a dense and dilute phase and this process is intimately linked with the regulation of cellular processes. It is therefore highly relevant to know how metabolites partition between these phases. It is shown here that the partitioning of components in a complex mixture can be robustly obtained from a single set of 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra recorded on the dilute and dense phases separately using &#8220;time&#8208;zero extrapolated&#8221; heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC0) spectroscopy. The spectral separation power of 2D NMR spectroscopy circumvents the need for physical isolation or workup of the mixture components in the two samples. Using quantitative 1D 1H NMR, it is validated that the HSQC0 approach effectively removes all the undermining effects that plague quantification in common 2D NMR experiments, including differential attenuation due to relaxation in the two phases, pulse imperfections, partial decoupling, off&#8208;resonance effects, and incomplete coherence transfer in case of scalar coupling variation. These results should be of widespread interest as partitioning into biomolecular condensates is crucial for the calibration of computational physicochemical models of phase separation and key to the further understanding of cellular biochemistry involving membrane&#8208;less organelles.

         <title>Macromolecular High&#8208;Affinity Binding Probed by Advanced Fluorescence Techniques</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For interacting biomolecules in solution, confocal fluorescence microscopy enables some very effective approaches to characterize intermolecular binding in complex sample environments and with small sample consumption. These approaches range from fluorescence&#8208;based genetically encoded biosensors for use in living cells to the high controllability in measuring binding curves even at very low picomolar concentrations.

Due to the extreme sensitivity and the intrinsic selectivity of fluorescence techniques, high&#8208;affinity binding can be measured even at extremely low molecule concentrations in the picomolar range. In particular, modern advanced techniques with fluorescence microscopes have provided considerable methodological advancements in recent years. Here, a brief description of the basic physical principles of fluorescence detection and its experimental measurement setups are provided. For interacting biomolecules in solution, confocal fluorescence microscopy enables some very effective approaches to characterize binding in complex sample environments and with small sample consumption. In addition to standard techniques with bulk samples in classical spectrometers, applications with single&#8208;molecule F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer, two&#8208;color coincidence detection, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy are presented. The strength of the more advanced techniques lies in their broad applicability, ranging from fluorescence&#8208;based genetically encoded biosensors for use in living cells to the high controllability in the measurement of binding curves even at very low molecule concentrations. The advantages and limitations of the individual techniques are compared and recent state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications are discussed.

         <title>Gold Nanoparticles Guided by Self&#8208;Assembling Peptides: From Sequence to Superstructure</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembling peptides act as versatile templates for gold nanoparticle (AuNP) synthesis. Their organization into discrete nanostructures or hydrogels enables control over AuNP morphology and assembly, offering new opportunities for functional nanomaterials.

Peptide&#8208;based supramolecular assemblies have emerged as useful scaffolds to control the synthesis and spatial organization of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) into nanocomposite superstructures. This concept article summarizes recent progress in the design of peptide&#8208;directed AuNP assemblies, focusing on how subtle variations in peptide sequence, conjugation strategy, and synthesis conditions influence NP morphology, chiral arrangement, and the resulting optical properties. It highlights key strategies for rationally tailoring structural parameters, such as particle size, shape, and interparticle spacing, which determine the collective optical and plasmonic behaviors of the assemblies. The fundamental design rules discussed here provide critical insights for constructing programmable AuNP&#8208;based nanomaterials, potentially useful in diverse fields including sensing, optical devices, and catalysis. Finally, it outlines current challenges and propose directions to further exploit the unique versatility of peptide&#8208;nanoparticle hybrid systems in nanotechnology.

         <title>Chemically Synthesized LRAD3&#8208;D1 Interacts with N&#8208;Terminal Domain of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Protein</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical synthesis, calcium&#8208;templated in&#8208;vitro folding and competitive ELISA assay reveal that only domain 1 of the LRAD3 ectodomain interacts with the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;related corona virus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) spike NTD, while domains 2 and 3 do not, providing valuable insight into ACE2&#8208;independent viral entry pathways that may contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches targeting SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 strains associated with severe neurological complications.

Growing evidence of post&#8208;COVID neurological complications, such as encephalopathy, neurodegeneration, and cognitive impairment, suggests severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;related corona virus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) viral infection into the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of viral entry into the CNS, where human angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is barely expressed, is critical for addressing the neurological consequences of COVID&#8208;19. Importantly, the low&#8208;density lipoprotein receptor class A domain containing 3 (LRAD3) is overexpressed in brain cells, suggesting a possible ACE2&#8208;independent alternate pathway of viral entry into brain cells. Herein, the interaction of the chemically synthesized LRAD3 domains with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein is reported. It is observed that the extracellular domains of LRAD3 depend on calcium for proper folding and maintaining their structural integrity. The results reveal that domain 1 of LRAD3, which is most accessible from the cell surface, engages with the N&#8208;terminal domain of the viral spike protein. These findings open up possibilities to develop new therapeutic strategies targeting ACE2 independent viral entry pathways.

&lt;p&gt;Chemical synthesis, calcium-templated in-vitro folding and competitive ELISA assay reveal that only domain 1 of the LRAD3 ectodomain interacts with the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike NTD, while domains 2 and 3 do not, providing valuable insight into ACE2-independent viral entry pathways that may contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches targeting SARS-CoV-2 strains associated with severe neurological complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing evidence of post-COVID neurological complications, such as encephalopathy, neurodegeneration, and cognitive impairment, suggests severe acute respiratory syndrome-related corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral infection into the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of viral entry into the CNS, where human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is barely expressed, is critical for addressing the neurological consequences of COVID-19. Importantly, the low-density lipoprotein receptor class A domain containing 3 (LRAD3) is overexpressed in brain cells, suggesting a possible ACE2-independent alternate pathway of viral entry into brain cells. Herein, the interaction of the chemically synthesized LRAD3 domains with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is reported. It is observed that the extracellular domains of LRAD3 depend on calcium for proper folding and maintaining their structural integrity. The results reveal that domain 1 of LRAD3, which is most accessible from the cell surface, engages with the N-terminal domain of the viral spike protein. These findings open up possibilities to develop new therapeutic strategies targeting ACE2 independent viral entry pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hybridization Probes Featuring a Pyrenylpyridine C&#8208;Nucleoside or Its Palladacycle as a Fluorescent Sensor Moiety</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When placed in the middle of a double helix as a nucleobase surrogate, pyren&#8208;1&#8208;ylpyridine and its palladacyclic derivative show fluorescence emission sensitive to the identity of the canonical nucleobase opposite to it. Emission of the palladacycle is weaker but the base discrimination stronger, possibly because of Pd(II)&#8208;mediated base pairing. More emissive metallacycles can find use in genotyping single&#8208;nucleotide polymorphisms.

A C&#8208;nucleoside analog having pyren&#8208;1&#8208;ylpyridine as the base moiety has been synthesized and incorporated in the middle of a short oligodeoxynucleotide. A portion of this oligonucleotide is cyclopalladated at the modified residue, and the potential of both the metal&#8208;free and the palladacyclic oligonucleotide as hybridization probes for single&#8208;nucleotide polymorphism genotyping is assessed by melting studies on relevant duplexes using various techniques. Conventional ultraviolet (UV) melting profiles at 260&#8201;nm reveal considerable destabilization of the palladacyclic duplexes relative to their metal&#8208;free counterparts. Circular dichroism melting temperatures are higher than their UV counterparts, especially with the palladacyclic duplexes. Cyclopalladation markedly reduces the fluorescence emission of the pyrenylpyridine moiety, but both the metal&#8208;free and the palladacyclic oligonucleotide exhibit a qualitatively similar pattern of increased fluorescence on hybridization with a complementary sequence, consistent with the pyrene ring being &#8220;pushed out&#8221; of the base stack. Emission at low temperature is dependent on the nucleobase paired with the pyrenylpyridine base surrogate with both of the modified oligonucleotides. This discrimination is stronger with the palladacyclic oligonucleotide, possibly owing to Pd(II)&#8208;mediated base pairing.

         <title>Designing the Proteome with Chemical Tools: Degrons and Beyond</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review details recent advances in chemical strategies to control protein turnover. The tools capable of activating, finding, and bypassing degrons for targeted protein degradation are highlighted.

Cell biology relies on precise changes in protein stability, which can be chemically harnessed to transform cell fate. Decades of research have revealed the many intricate systems underlying cellular proteostasis, which can be hijacked by proximity&#8208;based degrader compounds. The archetypal degrader, proteolysis targeting chimera, recruits E3 ligases to protein targets to facilitate their ubiquitination and degradation in the proteasome. Being able to customize the human proteome with chemical tools has great value for fundamental research and for clinical progress through the controlled elimination of disease&#8208;causing proteins. Success within the degrader field has reinvigorated interest in mapping the mechanisms underlying native protein degradation, which has platformed new degrader classes capable of advancing the field toward the goal of degrading the entire human proteome. This review discusses ongoing strategies to identify degrons regulating native protein turnover, advances in chemical tools to activate these degrons, and new attempts to streamline degron pathways for simplified targeted protein degradation. The continued discovery and application of degrons has the power to transform human biology and combat disease.

         <title>Rational Design and Bioactive Screening of Peptide Inhibitors Targeting Host&#8211;Pathogen Interactions in Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Virus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops peptide inhibitors targeting SFTSV host&#8211;pathogen interactions, specifically blocking viral Gn binding to host receptors DC&#8208;SIGN and NMMHC&#8208;IIA. Using rational design and screening, peptides II&#8208;1 and II&#8208;4 exhibit potent antiviral activity, high binding affinity (KD&#8201;&#8776;&#8201;10&#8722;8&#8201;M), low cytotoxicity, and minimal hemolytic toxicity. Molecular dynamics confirm stable binding, offering a promising platform for SFTSV therapeutics.

Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) poses a significant threat to public health, with limited therapeutic options available. This study focuses on the rational design and screening of peptide inhibitors targeting host&#8211;pathogen interactions, specifically between the viral Gn glycoprotein and key host cell receptors, DC&#8208;SIGN and NMMHC&#8208;IIA. By employing molecular dynamics simulations, alanine scanning, and peptide docking techniques, peptides were designed to disrupt these protein&#8211;protein interactions. Among the synthesized candidates, peptides II&#8208;1 and II&#8208;4 demonstrate potent inhibitory activity against SFTSV infection, with reduced TCID50 values in cellular assays and displayed exceptional affinity (KD&#8201;=&#8201;7.381&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;8&#8201;M, 1.439&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;8&#8201;M), These peptides also exhibit low cytotoxicity and hemolytic toxicity, highlighting their safety profile. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm strong binding affinities for these peptides, underpinned by stable hydrogen bonding interactions. This research provides a promising platform for developing peptide&#8208;based therapeutics targeting SFTSV, paving the way for further preclinical evaluation and clinical applications.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 14, July 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, nanobody&#8208;based photocontrollable platforms&#8212;including photobodies, OptoNBs, photoactivatable nanobody conjugate inducers of dimerizations , and others&#8212;have been developed to achieve light&#8208;mediated control of cellular functions with improved spatiotemporal precision.

Nanobodies, the camelid&#8208;derived single&#8208;chain variable domain of heavy&#8208;chain&#8208;only antibodies, are compact in size and exhibit high binding affinity and specificity to their binding partners. As innovative antibody modalities, nanobodies have garnered significant attention in medicine and biological research. To achieve higher spatiotemporal precision, nanobody&#8208;based light&#8208;controlled systems&#8212;such as photobody, optobody, photoactivatable nanobody conjugate inducers of dimerization, and others&#8212;have been developed. These systems enable optical control of biological processes while leveraging the advantages of nanobodies as a binding moiety. This concept, summarizes nanobody&#8208;based photoregulated systems for investigating biology through light, highlights their advantages and potential limitations, and discusses future directions in this emerging research area.

         <title>Exploiting SpyTag/SpyCatcher Technology to Design New Artificial Catalytic Copper Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 14, July 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing artificial metal sites in proteins is challenging due to the need to place the metal site in precise positions and to tailor the coordination environment of the metal. A modular approach based on the SpyTag/SpyCatcher technology is used to provide the Spy construct with a Cu2+/ATCUN site. This strategy enables versatile metalloprotein design by shifting complexity from a protein to a peptide.

Designing artificial metal binding sites within a protein is challenging since amino acid residues need to be placed in desired positions in the final construct and the use of non&#8208;natural amino acids is difficult. The alternative approach of directing the insertion of artificial metal coordination systems presents the difficulty of grafting such site in a single desired position. Spy protein is composed of a protein component (SpyCatcher) which binds spontaneously an oligopeptide (SpyTag) with formation of an isopeptide bond. A SpyTag peptide equipped with an ATCUN (amino terminal copper and nickel) binding site is designed to bind copper(II) with high femtomolar affinity both in the absence of SpyCatcher and in the reconstituted Spy construct. The Cu2+ ATCUN site in the reconstituted Spy protein presents a catalytic activity in reactive oxygen species production, higher than that of the SpyTag peptide alone. This method offers a novel approach for constructing artificial metalloproteins by incorporating functional metal binding sites into a peptide, which can then be clicked onto its protein counterpart. The small size and modularity of this construct make it versatile for integration into other protein systems, eventually moving the complexity from a protein to a peptide and highlighting its potential for protein design.

&lt;p&gt;Designing artificial metal sites in proteins is challenging due to the need to place the metal site in precise positions and to tailor the coordination environment of the metal. A modular approach based on the SpyTag/SpyCatcher technology is used to provide the Spy construct with a Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/ATCUN site. This strategy enables versatile metalloprotein design by shifting complexity from a protein to a peptide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing artificial metal binding sites within a protein is challenging since amino acid residues need to be placed in desired positions in the final construct and the use of non-natural amino acids is difficult. The alternative approach of directing the insertion of artificial metal coordination systems presents the difficulty of grafting such site in a single desired position. Spy protein is composed of a protein component (SpyCatcher) which binds spontaneously an oligopeptide (SpyTag) with formation of an isopeptide bond. A SpyTag peptide equipped with an ATCUN (amino terminal copper and nickel) binding site is designed to bind copper(II) with high femtomolar affinity both in the absence of SpyCatcher and in the reconstituted Spy construct. The Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ATCUN site in the reconstituted Spy protein presents a catalytic activity in reactive oxygen species production, higher than that of the SpyTag peptide alone. This method offers a novel approach for constructing artificial metalloproteins by incorporating functional metal binding sites into a peptide, which can then be clicked onto its protein counterpart. The small size and modularity of this construct make it versatile for integration into other protein systems, eventually moving the complexity from a protein to a peptide and highlighting its potential for protein design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cyanophenylalanine as an Infrared Probe for Iron&#8211;Sulfur Cluster Redox State in Multicenter Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 14, July 18, 2025. </description>

The noncanonical amino acid, cyanophenylalanine, is genetically inserted close to iron&#8211;sulfur clusters of either spinach ferredoxin or iron&#8211;iron hydrogenase, and functions as an infrared spectroscopic reporter for changes in cluster redox state.

The noncanonical amino acid, para&#8208;cyanophenylalanine (CNF), when incorporated into metalloproteins, functions as an infrared spectroscopic probe for the redox state of iron&#8208;sulfur clusters, offering a strategy for determining electron occupancy in the electron transport chains of complex metalloenzymes. A redshift of &#8776;1&#8211;2&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in the nitrile (NC) stretching frequency is observed, following reduction of spinach ferredoxin modified to contain CNF close to its [2Fe&#8211;2S] center, and this shift is reversed on re&#8208;oxidation. We extend this to CNF positioned near to the proximal [4Fe&#8211;4S] cluster of the [FeFe] hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans. In combination with a distal [4Fe&#8211;4S] cluster and the [4Fe&#8211;4S] cluster of the active site &#8216;H&#8208;cluster&#8217; ([4Fe&#8211;4S]H), the proximal cluster forms an electron relay connecting the active site to the surface of the protein. Again, a reversible shift in wavenumber for CNF is observed, following cluster reduction in either apo&#8208;protein (containing the iron&#8208;sulfur clusters but lacking the active site) or holo&#8208;protein with intact active site, demonstrating the general applicability of this approach to studying complex metalloenzymes.

         <title>A Tailored Phospho&#8208;p53 Library Probes Antibody Specificity and Recognition Limitations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 14, July 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Site&#8208;specifically phosphorylated isoforms of the tumor suppressor p53 &#8211; encompassing all seven known phosphorylation sites within the TAD1 domain &#8211;are created upon optimization of semisynthesis protocols. This &#8220;designer" p53 library enabled validation of phosphorylation&#8208;specific p53 antibodies and revealed epitope masking by phosphorylation in commonly used antibodies.

The tumor suppressor protein p53, known as the &#8220;guardian of the genome,&#8221; is regulated by a complex network of post&#8208;translational modifications. Phosphorylations at 7 Ser/Thr residues within the N&#8208;terminal transactivation domain 1 (TAD1) play a role in p53 activation, yet their precise mechanisms of action remain elusive due to challenges in accessing well&#8208;defined phosphorylated isoforms. To address this limitation, this study harnesses a recently developed approach for the semisynthesis of site&#8208;specifically phosphorylated p53 to generate a comprehensive library of singly phosphorylated p53 including all TAD1 sites: Ser6, Ser9, Ser15, Thr18, Ser20, Ser33, and Ser37. The library was then used to probe the specificity of common p53 antibodies in western blot analysis. This study's results confirm the specificity of the target site of most phosphorylation&#8208;specific anti&#8208;p53 antibodies, but also reveal wide&#8208;spread epitope masking by phosphorylation, which has implications for p53 research and diagnostics. This "designer" p53 library thus provides a toolkit to study the function of p53 phosphorylation directly and indirectly as a quality control agent for some of the most widely used reagents in the field.

         <title>Hybrid Crosslinking of Collagen&#8208;Mimetic Peptides for Tunable Assembly and Enhanced Biopolymer Encapsulation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 14, July 18, 2025. </description>

Integrating Lys&#8208;GTA crosslinking and Zn(II)&#8208;His coordination can induce the self&#8208;assembly of collagen&#8208;mimetic peptides into spherical hollow spheres capable of encapsulating biopolymers.

Collagen, the most abundant protein in the extracellular matrix of mammals, plays a vital role in maintaining cellular structure. Collagen&#8208;mimetic peptides (CMPs), synthetic biopolymers, have emerged as promising materials for biomedical applications because of their excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and tunable chemical and physical properties. In this study, a series of CMPs were designed using a Pro&#8208;Pro&#8208;Gly triplet&#8208;based template, incorporating lysine residues for Lys&#8208;glutaraldehyde (Lys&#8208;GTA) crosslinking and histidine residues for metal&#8208;His coordination to facilitate CMP assembly. To modulate the morphology of the assembled structures, peptides of varying lengths were&#160;synthesized and histidine residues within the CMP sequence were strategically positioned. Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy confirmed that the designed CMPs assembled into distinct spherical structures under physiological conditions. The fluorescence measurements and confocal microscopy further demonstrated that these peptide&#8208;assembled spheres can encapsulate 40&#8201;K FITC&#8208;Dextran while forming large&#8208;scale structures. In summary, an effective strategy for assembling CMPs into higher&#8208;order spherical structures is developed by integrating Lys&#8208;GTA crosslinking with metal&#8208;His coordination. Notably, these assemblies exhibited the capability to encapsulate large biomolecules, offering valuable insights for the design of collagen&#8208;based biomaterials.

         <title>Designing an Entactin&#8208;Inspired Short Bioactive Hydrogel as Biofunctional Scaffold</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 14, July 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembling behavior of a novel bioactive peptide sequence derived from the G3 domain of the entactin protein is explored. The structural modifications leading to differential nanofibrous entanglement of these entactin&#8208;inspired peptide hydrogels at physiological pH upon cell culture media perfusion further prove the potential of these hydrogels in effectively controlling the cellular behavior.

Self&#8208;assembled peptide hydrogels developed from bioactive domains of extracellular matrix (ECM) have shown great capabilities to mimic the structural and functional aspects of ECM. In this direction, the&#160;self&#8208;assembling potential of a minimalist bioactive sequence (YWTD) derived from one of the essential bridging proteins of ECM, i.e., entactin, is explored. However, at physiological pH, the negative charge of the aspartate residue induces strong intermolecular repulsion that prevents the self&#8208;assembly of the peptide monomers. Interestingly, the peptide forms self&#8208;supporting hydrogels at a slightly acidic pH, i.e., pH 6.2, through surface charge neutralization, thereby minimizing the repulsive interaction. Since it is aimed to explore its use in controlling cellular adhesion and proliferation, the buffering capacity of the media is utilized to adjust the pH of the gel to physiological levels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on self&#8208;assembly of a novel bioactive sequence derived from the G3 domain of entactin protein. These hydrogels self&#8208;assembled at physiological pH display a nanofibrous structure with tuneable mechanical stiffness, which are biocompatible toward fibroblast cells. An improved cellular adhesion and proliferation are evident within this novel matrix, thus proving it as a suitable biomaterial with future potential in the field of biomedicine.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of 3&#8208;Halochromones via Oxidative &#945;&#8208;Halogenation of Enaminones in TPGS&#8208;750&#8208;M Micelles</title>

3&#8208;Halochromones are useful intermediates that enable access to bioactive chromone derivatives. A chemoenzymatic method is reported to synthesize 3&#8208;halochromones catalyzed by an engineered vanadium&#8208;dependent chloroperoxidase from Curvularia inaequalis. The reactions are performed in an aqueous buffer containing a surfactant TPGS&#8208;750&#8208;M and 10% acetone with moderate to excellent yields over a range of substrates.

Synthesis strategies of chromones have been widely investigated due to the abundance of chromone moiety in bioactive compounds and natural products. Of which, 3&#8208;halochromones are a versatile set of precursors to synthetically access valuable compounds with chromone frameworks. Generally, 3&#8208;halochromones are synthesized from o&#8208;hydroxy enaminones through oxidative &#945;&#8208;halogenation, a process that often uses toxic and corrosive chemicals. Herein, an alternative strategy is presented for oxidative &#945;&#8208;halogenation catalyzed by vanadium&#8208;dependent chloroperoxidase from Curvularia inaequalis (CiVCPO) with H2O2/KX (X&#8201;=&#8201;Cl, Br, and I) in an aqueous medium. With a micellar system from a surfactant TPGS&#8208;750&#8208;M, substrate concentration can be increased to 50&#8201;mM without compromising the yield, thereby, significantly reducing the use of organic solvents. Substrate scope investigation reveals that bromination and chlorination processes prefer electron&#8208;donating substituents although moderate electron&#8208;withdrawing groups are tolerated (20 examples). Additionally, iodination processes can be performed under the optimized condition. However, slow conversion indicates that further optimization is needed. It is also found that iodination can occur without CiVCPO, albeit at a lower conversion. Further investigation suggests that such a conversion took place via I2 generated in&#8201;situ. Overall, this chemoenzymatic method can offer an environmentally friendly approach to access a variety of 3&#8208;bromo or 3&#8208;chlorochromones.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Ephedrine Initiated by Pyridoxal Phosphate&#8208;Dependent Formation of Cathinone</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 14, July 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative pathway to ephedra alkaloids via (S)&#8211;cathinone is investigated in plants. This pathway circumvents the formation of 1&#8208;phenylpropane&#8208;1,2&#8208;dione as an intermediate, which has been part of the predominantly postulated biosynthetic pathway for the last decades. This alternative pathway involves an enzymatic pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)&#8208;dependent carboligation of benzoyl&#8208;CoA and L&#8208;alanine in a single step.

Ephedra alkaloids possess some of the most basic structures of alkaloids. Despite their importance for human use and their commercial relevance, the biosynthesis of ephedra alkaloids has remained enigmatic. The predominant biosynthetic pathway in the literature proposes a thiamin&#8208;dependent carboligation followed by a transaminase, although no candidate enzymes have yet been identified in ephedra alkaloid producers. In this work, an alternative pathway in plants to ephedra alkaloids via (S)&#8211;cathinone is investigated that circumvents the formation of 1&#8208;phenylpropane&#8208;1,2&#8208;dione as an intermediate and is in full agreement with previous biosynthetic studies. This alternative pathway involves the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)&#8208;dependent carboligation of &#8211;benzoyl&#8208;CoA&#8211; and L&#8208;alanine in a single step. The PLP&#8208;dependent formation of labeled and unlabeled (S)&#8211;cathinone is detected in the plant lysate of young stem tissue of various Ephedra species that contain Ephedra alkaloids, as well as in young leaf tissue of Catha edulis. The incorporation of labeled nitrogen from L&#8208;alanine into (S)&#8208;cathinone supports the hypothesis that an &#945;&#8208;oxoamine synthase (AOS) catalyzes the formation of (S)&#8208;cathinone, bypassing the dione as an intermediate. These results demonstrate the involvement of a PLP&#8208;dependent AOS as a pivotal step in the biosynthesis of ephedra alkaloids.

         <title>Characterization of DnaB&#8211;DnaG Interaction in M. tuberculosis Using Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering&#8208;Based Dissociation Assay</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 14, July 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study characterizes interactions between DnaB helicase and DnaG primase in Mycobacterium tuberculosis using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, surface plasmon resonance, and cross&#8208;linking. The findings reveal that DnaG forms dimers in solution, which are destabilized upon DnaB binding. This interaction suggests a regulatory mechanism in DNA replication as well as potential targets for antibacterial drug development.

The complex interactions between helicase and primase, two key components of the replisome involved in DNA replication in Mycobacterium tuberculosis are studied. Utilizing purified, complementary domains of these proteins, a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis and a cross&#8208;linking assay to characterize their binding dynamics are employed. The SPR analysis reveals a binding dissociation constant of 0.21&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.08&#8201;&#956;M, and the cross&#8208;linking assay suggests the possible formation of a heterodimer species. Importantly, a small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering dissociation assay to study the dynamic interactions between the proteins in solution is utilized. The findings provide new opportunities for targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at DNA replication in M. tuberculosis by revealing the structural interplay between helicase and primase.

         <title>Peptidomimetics Targeting the Amyloidogenicity of Nucleophosmin 1 Mutations in Acute Myeloid Leukemia</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 14, July 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Previous studies reveal an unexpected tendency for amyloid aggregation in specific regions of the C&#8208;terminal domain (CTD) of nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1), a nucleolar chaperone involved in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Herein, several peptide analogs of NPM1264&#8208;277 (amyloid core) with conservative substitutions are designed and evaluated through biophysical and cellular assays as potential modulators of amyloid aggregation in AML.

Nucleophosmin 1(NPM1) is an abundant human protein endowed with many functions where whose dysregulation leads to various cancers and mutations are relevant in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In the wild&#8208;type form, pentameric NPM1 resides mainly in the nucleolus even if it shuttles toward the cytosol exerting its chaperon function; conversely in AML&#8208;mutated versions, it has mainly a cytoplasmic localization, hence the name NPMc+. All types of AML mutations determine an important amyloid aggregation propensity of the C&#8208;terminal domains (CTD) of NPMc+&#8201;and to exploit this amyloidogenicity for therapeutical purposes; herein, this study presents the design and structural and functional investigations of a series of peptides analogs of the sequence of the second helix of the three&#8208;helix bundle of the wt CTD as potential enhancers of amyloid aggregation. Peptides are designed by introducing conservative mutations in the native 264&#8722;277 fragment, and their structural features and amyloid propensities are assessed through ThT fluorescence, circular dichroism spectroscopies and scanning electron microscopy. Several &#8220;accelerator sequences&#8221; are employed in amyloid seeding assays (ASAs): The sequence NPM1264&#8208;277 K267R, with the single mutation Lys267/Arg, exhibits the greater ability to act as a promoter of the amyloid aggregation of NPM1264&#8208;277, limiting its toxicity and rescuing cell viability in OCI&#8208;AML3 cells.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 14, July 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils a novel synthetic platform by solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis for generating FUBI&#8208;based chemical tools to investigate FUBIylation, a poorly understood ubiquitin&#8208;like signaling process linked to cancer. By employing these innovative probes, we uncover novel FUBI interactors, paving the way for transformative insights into FUBI biology and its therapeutic potential.

The Ubiquitin&#8208;like protein FUBI is encoded in humans by the FAU gene, whose down&#8208;regulation in prostate, ovarian and breast cancer is significantly associated with poor prognosis. Despite its implications in disease progression, the regulatory mechanisms orchestrated by FUBI remain elusive. To address this knowledge gap, a linear synthetic platform is developed to generate FUBI chemical tools, enabling the site&#8208;specific incorporation of unnatural building blocks and the introduction of fluorophores, tags, and reactive warheads. Using this platform, activity&#8208;based probes are created for FUBI conjugation and deconjugation enzymes, validating them in cell lysate&#8208;based assays and proteomics. Additionally, a triazole&#8208;linked Di&#8208;FUBI is synthesized to investigate FUBI chain modulators. Among the proteomics hits, IMPDH1 and the deubiquitinase UCHL3 are identified as novel Di&#8208;FUBI specific interactors. Further characterization revealed that Di&#8208;FUBI inhibits UCHL3 cleavage activity in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner, suggesting a novel regulatory interplay between UCHL3 and FUBI. Collectively, these tools demonstrate the versatility of the synthetic FUBI platform, advancing the characterization of FUBI&#8208;related enzymes in the ongoing efforts to decipher the complex code of ubiquitin&#8208;like signaling.

         <title>A De Novo Designed Metalloprotein Displays Variable Thermal Stability and Binding Stoichiometry with Transition Metal Ions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 14, July 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A de&#8201;novo designed single&#8208;chain coiled coil protein is unfolded in apo&#8208;state but folds up upon addition of divalent transition metal ions Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II). The resulting metal&#8208;bound complexes exhibit distinct thermal stability and metal stoichiometry, making this protein a promising starting point for the design of fully metal&#8208;selective de&#8201;novo proteins.

Metal&#8208;binding selectivity in natural proteins is determined by multiple factors such as the protein's structure, metal concentration within cellular compartments, and the presence of metallochaperones. The in&#8201;vitro selectivity of proteins for transition metal ions is largely governed by the Irving&#8211;Williams series, which states protein&#8208;metal complex stability follows the order Co(II) &lt; Ni(II) &lt; Cu(II) &gt; Zn(II). A de&#8201;novo protein has been designed that folds in the presence of certain transition metal ions into a monomeric &#945;&#8208;helical bundle, with the least stable protein&#8208;metal complex being formed with Cu(II). Moreover, when increasing the metal concentration of Cu(II) or Zn(II), more metal ions are incorporated into the protein accompanied by a concurrent decrease in the amount of secondary structure. One reason may be that there is a balance between stability conferred by the coordination of the metal ion(s) and stability conferred by hydrophobic packing of the &#945;&#8208;helical bundle. Metals may therefore adopt distorted coordination geometries, or binding of multiple ions may cause distortion of the protein backbone, leading to compromised folding of the protein scaffold, or variable thermal stabilities of the metalloprotein complexes. This protein scaffold therefore contributes to the deciphering of design rules for metal selectivity in proteins.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Synuclein Sequences from Long&#8208;Lived Animals Display Generally Diminished Aggregation Compared to Shorter&#8208;Lived Animals Including Humans</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 14, July 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is no obvious evolutionary pressure in humans to avoid amyloid aggregation that contributes to neurodegenerative diseases in the elderly. However, other animals have much longer lifespans. This study finds that &#945;&#8208;synuclein proteins from longer&#8208;lived animals are resistant to aggregation, while proteins from shorter&#8208;lived species are not, irrespective of evolutionary distance.

The overall process of protein aggregation from soluble species to amyloid fibrils is toxic to neurons and can propagate along neuronal connections in ways that potentially explain the pathological progression in most neurodegenerative diseases. One of these aggregation&#8208;prone proteins is &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;Syn), which forms insoluble protein deposits in Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies. The majority of cases of Parkinson's disease occur fairly late in life, and even early&#8208;onset variants of the disease caused by mutations to &#945;&#8208;Syn occur toward the end of the lifespan for prehistoric man. This suggests a lack of evolutionary pressure to prevent protein aggregation in animals with similar or shorter lifespans. However, &#945;&#8208;Syn is also found in animals with notably longer lifespans. Here, this study tests the aggregation propensity of &#945;&#8208;Syn sequences from short&#8208; and longer&#8208;lived animals at a range of evolutionary distances from humans. This study finds that, in general, longer&#8208;lived animals display slower &#945;&#8208;Syn aggregation kinetics and the formation of smaller and less uniform fibrils. Overall, data indicate that some evolutionary pressure may have existed for preventing &#945;&#8208;Syn aggregation, but that pressure is lost in the more recent branch of shorter&#8208;lived animals containing humans.

         <title>A Polyproline Type II Peptidomimetic Disrupts a Grb2 SH3C Domain Protein&#8211;Protein Interaction Implicated in Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 14, July 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzoylurea scaffolds accurately mimic the side&#8208;chain vectors of the i, i&#8201;+&#8201;1/2, and i&#8201;+&#8201;3 positions of polyproline type II helices, showing functional activity in the disruption of a protein&#8211;protein interaction implicated in breast cancer.

Given the essential role of protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs) in cellular signaling pathways, their selective modulation is of great therapeutic interest. Mimicry of secondary structural protein elements has emerged as a promising strategy, with various scaffolds reproducing recognition surfaces of &#945;&#8211;helical and &#946;&#8211;strand/sheet proteins. A critical PPI, controlling cell growth and proliferation in breast and other cancers, occurs between growth factor receptor&#8208;bound protein 2 (Grb2) and a polyproline II (PPII) helix embedded in Gab2. Herein, the first example of a general approach for nonpeptidic mimicry of extended PPII helices is presented and it is demonstrated that the scaffold may be functionalized to recapitulate the binding characteristics of crucial hydrophobic and cationic Gab2 hot&#8208;spot side&#8208;chains. The rationally designed peptidomimetic binds Grb2 at the same position as Gab2 (protein&#8208;observed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)) with affinities comparable to the native peptide sequence (surface plasmon resonance (SPR)). With the addition of a new PPII minimalist scaffold, these studies further validate the use of diverse secondary structure peptidomimetics in disrupting therapeutically relevant PPIs.

         <title>Enhancing Peptide Cyclization: Unveiling the Key Roles of Coupling Reagents and Heat for Optimal Results</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 14, July 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclization of a de novo octapeptide composed of alternating L&#8208; and D&#8208;amino acids is optimized by studying the influence of critical factors to improve efficiency, such as coupling reagents, temperature, heating method, chaotropic agents, solvent, and concentration. This work provides a valuable framework for the cyclization of challenging peptides.

Cyclic peptides offer several advantages over their linear counterparts, including enhanced structural stability due to their rigid conformation and increased resistance to enzymatic proteolysis. Additionally, their ring structure and constrained conformation reduce the entropic cost upon binding to receptors and other biological targets, leading to higher binding affinity and specificity. However, peptide macrocyclization is often synthetically challenging due to factors such as reduced entropy, oligomer formation, and C&#8208;terminal epimerization. The conventional approach for synthesizing cyclic peptides involves the direct coupling of amine and carboxyl termini in the solution phase, using protected side&#8208;chain peptides and coupling reagents. Despite this, improving the efficiency of head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclization remains a key challenge. In this study, the cyclization of a de&#8201;novo octapeptide composed of alternating l&#8208; and d&#8208;amino acids is optimized, in which the impact of various factors on the cyclization process is examined, including coupling reagents, temperature, heating method, chaotropic agents, solvent, and concentration. This investigation has not only led to the identification of efficient cyclization conditions, but also provides a valuable framework for the cyclization of other challenging peptide sequences. The insights gained in this study contribute to the field of peptide chemistry, expanding the understanding of peptide cyclization reactions.

In this study, the cyclization of a &lt;i&gt;de&#8201;novo&lt;/i&gt; octapeptide composed of alternating &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;- and &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-amino acids is optimized, in which the impact of various factors on the cyclization process is examined, including coupling reagents, temperature, heating method, chaotropic agents, solvent, and concentration. This investigation has not only led to the identification of efficient cyclization conditions, but also provides a valuable framework for the cyclization of other challenging peptide sequences. The insights gained in this study contribute to the field of peptide chemistry, expanding the understanding of peptide cyclization reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Nucleoside Derivatives by Biomimetic Ester Migration</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 14, July 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In tRNA aminoacylated nucleosides represent the central transfer unit of amino acids. An occurring 2&#8242;&#8208;3&#8242;&#8208;transaminoacylation is biomimetically exploited to successfully synthesize nucleosidic acid esters. This approach can be further expanded on sulfonic acid esters, which has the potential of a broad range of stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;controlled modifications of nucleosides, resulting in precursors or target molecules in medicinal chemistry.

Modified nucleosides play important roles as agents in medicinal chemistry due to their anti&#8208;inflammatory, antiviral, and antiproliferative properties, as well as in biochemical processes like protein biosynthesis. Aminoacylated nucleosides in tRNA represent the central transfer unit of amino acids in the biosynthesis of peptides. Consequently, their synthesis in a prebiotic context is of great significance for further elucidations regarding the origin of life. To verify the formation of these structures in complex mixtures of regio&#8208; and stereoisomers, reference structures and their synthesis are of fundamental importance. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methodologies for the synthesis of monomeric tRNA nucleoside derivatives frequently result in the production of regioisomeric mixtures or encounter challenges related to isomerization. In this context, a concise and comprehensive approach for the chemical synthesis of nucleosidic amino acid esters is presented. The three&#8208;step reaction sequence exploits the phenomenon of 2&#8242;&#8208;3&#8242;&#8208;transaminoacylation in nucleosides providing the desired compounds in high yields. This biomimetic approach is further expanded to the activation of hydroxy groups by application of sulfonic acid esters. This has the potential to facilitate extensive modification via substitution or cross&#8208;coupling reactions, enabling the stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;controlled transformation of nucleosides into valuable target molecules or precursors in medicinal chemistry.

         <dc:description>
Designing artificial metal sites in proteins is challenging due to the need to place the metal site in precise positions and to tailor the coordination environment of the metal. In article 10.1002/cbic.202500208, Matteo Tegoni and co&#8208;workers use a modular approach using the SpyTag/SpyCatcher technology to provide the Spy construct with a Cu2+/ATCUN site. The reconstituted copper protein showed enhanced ROS catalytic activity. This strategy enables versatile metalloprotein design by shifting complexity from a protein to a peptide.

         <dc:description>
Cytochrome P450 (CYPs) are a type of heme monooxygenase mainly found in the liver and intestines, responsible for the catalysis of the oxidative metabolism of several endogenous and exogenous substances, playing a crucial role in the clinical drugs metabolism. Therefore, the development of highly sensitive and selective probes for rapid detection of CYP activity in complex living systems. This will contribute to the identification of disease targets and advance human health.

The heme monooxygenase cytochrome P450 (CYPs), which play a major role in human drug metabolism, is predominantly found in the liver and intestines. CYPs are essential for the metabolism of therapeutic drugs and the treatment of diseases. It catalyzes the oxidative metabolism of several endogenous and exogenous chemicals. The expression and biological functions of CYP are affected by environmental factors, genetic variations, and physiological conditions, which can lead to adverse effects and reduce the therapeutic efficacy of drugs in humans. Therefore, there has been considerable interest in the development of probes that can detect the activity of CYPs in complex living systems. This review explores the recent advancements in our understanding of the structure and function of CYPs. It highlights the need to develop specific probes for various CYP subtypes using nonoptical, fluorescent, and bioluminescent substrates. Furthermore, it summarizes the potential of certain CYP subtypes as therapeutic targets for various diseases. Finally, the challenges and prospects of probes for monitoring CYP activity are explored.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 14, July 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This mini&#8208;review highlights the use of ene&#8208;reductases under visible light to trigger single&#8208;electron&#8208;reduction&#8208;initiated radical reactions, enabling controlled C&#63743;C, C&#63743;N, C&#63743;O, and C&#63743;S bond formations. These reactions provide significant assistance in addressing long&#8208;standing challenges in chemical synthesis.

Flavin&#8208;dependent ene&#8208;reductases (EREDs) have emerged as powerful biocatalysts for the asymmetric reduction of various substrates. This review focuses on the recent advances in light&#8208;induced electron transfer and subsequent reduction reactions mediated by EREDs. Upon photoexcitation, the flavin cofactor transitions to an excited state, significantly enhancing its reduction potential. Mechanistic insights into how light activation alters the redox properties of EREDs are discussed, leading to more efficient catalysis. The review also highlights the broadened application scope of photoexcited EREDs in organic synthesis. Additionally, the challenges and future directions in optimizing these light&#8208;driven biocatalytic processes are explored. This overview provides a foundation for developing novel, light&#8208;controlled enzymatic systems with enhanced catalytic performance.

Cyclometalated gold(III) complexes offer a versatile platform for selective biological interactions, including cysteine arylation, redox modulation, and enzyme inhibition. This review explores their roles in anticancer, antimicrobial, and protein modification strategies, highlighting their ability to disrupt metabolic pathways, modulate aquaporins, and serve as precision tools for next&#8208;generation therapeutics and imaging applications.

Au(III) organometallic complexes, particularly cyclometalated Au(III) compounds, have emerged as powerful tools in catalysis and bioinorganic chemistry, offering unique reactivity distinct from their Au(I) counterparts. Among their most interesting transformations, C&#8211;S cross&#8208;coupling reactions have become a selective strategy for cysteine arylation, enabling site&#8208;specific modifications of peptides and proteins. This review provides a comprehensive overview of cyclometalated Au(III) complexes in C&#8211;S bond formation, detailing the mechanistic insights, ligand effects, and electronic factors that dictate their reactivity. The role of ancillary ligands in tuning stability and selectivity is critically assessed, alongside advancements in structural modifications that enhance catalytic efficiency. Beyond fundamental C&#8211;S cross&#8208;coupling, the broader applications of these Au(III) complexes are explored, including enzyme inhibition, metabolic disruption, and transmembrane protein modulation, with implications in anticancer therapy, antimicrobial strategies, and in&#8201;vivo catalytic transformations. By bridging fundamental organometallic reactivity with innovative biomedical applications, this review highlights the potential of cyclometalated Au(III) complexes as next&#8208;generation catalysts for both synthetic and therapeutic innovations.

         <title>Computational De Novo Design of Group II Introns Yields Highly Active Ribozymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 14, July 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Group II Introns (G2Is) are large self&#8208;splicing ribozymes with promising biotechnological applications. This study utilized RNA inverse folding to design three novel G2Is. The designed intron Arq.I2, an unexpectedly proficient ribozyme, self&#8208;splices not only in&#8201;vitro, but also in Escherichia coli cells. The results demonstrate that complex ribozyme variants can be designed de&#8201;novo using existing inverse folding algorithms.

Group II introns (G2Is) are large self&#8208;splicing ribozymes with emerging potential in biotechnological applications. Despite growing interest, their complexity has so far precluded efforts to design them from scratch. While computational approaches have enabled the design of small RNA catalysts, methods for engineering large ribozymes remain underdeveloped. Herein, the RNA inverse folding algorithm aRNAque is used to design G2Is from scratch, yielding three novel self&#8208;splicing ribozymes with unusually stable structures. The designed intron Arq.I2 is revealed to be an unexpectedly proficient ribozyme in&#8201;vitro, self&#8208;splicing at a rate comparable to the fastest known G2Is. While most G2Is are believed to be inactive under intracellular conditions in the absence of maturase proteins, it is shown that Arq.I2 self&#8208;splices in Escherichia coli cells. The results demonstrate that highly active variants of large and complex ribozymes can be designed de&#8201;novo with relative ease using existing inverse folding algorithms, paving the way for the design of bespoke ribozymes derived from G2Is for the development of biotechnological tools.

         <title>A Browser&#8208;Based Tool for Assessing Accuracy of Isothermal Titration Calorimetry&#8208;Derived Parameters: Kd, &#916;H&#176;, and n</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accurate Kd determination is crucial for drug discovery and diagnostics. Accuracy confidence intervals (ACI)&#8208;ITC, a browser&#8208;based tool, calculates ACI for isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)&#8208;derived parameters, considering systematic errors in concentration and heat measurements. By offering probabilistic ranges for true Kd, &#916;H&#176;, and stoichiometry value n, ACI&#8208;ITC enhances experimental reliability, guiding better decisions, streamlining cross&#8208;platform accuracy assessments, and improving trust in ITC&#8208;based findings.

Accurate determination of equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) is essential for decision&#8208;making in drug discovery and diagnostics development. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), which requires no reactant labeling or immobilization, is commonly used to validate Kd values from high&#8208;throughput screens. Yet, like other methods, ITC results can be skewed by systematic errors in reactant concentrations, a fact that is often overlooked, potentially leading to misinformed decisions. To address this, accuracy confidence intervals (ACI)&#8208;ITC is developed, a browser&#8208;based tool that calculates ACI for ITC&#8208;derived parameters, offering probabilistic ranges for the true values of Kd, enthalpy change (&#916;H&#176;), and binding stoichiometry (n). Unlike traditional confidence intervals that consider only random errors, ACI&#8208;ITC explicitly accounts for systematic errors, providing a more accurate framework to assess experimental reliability. Alongside a user&#8208;friendly interface, it offers detailed guidance for determining uncertainties in concentrations and heat, which are critical inputs for assessing measurement accuracy. The tool's browser&#8208;based accessibility (https://aci.sci.yorku.ca) eliminates the need for specialized installation, enabling cross&#8208;platform compatibility and streamlining accuracy assessments. By highlighting the importance of systematic errors and providing a structured approach for their evaluation, ACI&#8208;ITC supports more robust conclusions, fosters better&#8208;informed decisions based on ITC measurements, and enhances the reliability of research findings.

         <title>Isomerized and Racemized Aspartyl and Deamidated Asparagine Residues Identified in &#611;S&#8208;Crystallin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lens contains some of the oldest proteins in the body that undergo deamidation, isomerization, and racemization at asparagine and aspartic acids during cataract. This study identifies these modifications in a major lens protein called &#611;S&#8208;crystallin using stable isotope&#8208;labeled peptides, and confidently assigns deamidation status using high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry.

&#611;S&#8208;crystallin is a major protein of the human lens and is highly modified with age and cataract due to a lack of lens protein turnover. Previous studies identify some sites of isomerization and racemization of deamidated asparaginyl and aspartyl residues in &#611;S but have been limited due to the complexity of isoforms and difficulty in characterizing deamidation posttranslational modifications. A total of 32 stable isotope&#8208;labeled peptides are created for &#611;S residues 7&#8211;18, 72&#8211;78, and 131&#8211;145, containing L&#8208;Asp, D&#8208;Asp, L&#8208;isoAsp, and D&#8208;isoAsp at D12, N14, N76, D77, and N143 to act as internal chromatography standards spiked into tryptic digests of nuclear insoluble protein of a cataractous human lens. High&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry is used to accurately assign deamidation status using the 19&#8201;mDa mass defect between isotopic peaks of deamidated and nondeamidated peptides. While peptides containing D&#8208;forms of Asp and isoAsp were assigned, the predominant isoforms contained L&#8208;isoAsp. High&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry using wide single ion monitoring data&#8208;independent acquisition also greatly improved the reliable identification of peptide deamidation states. These results will aid creation of &#611;S using native chemical ligation to examine the role of isoAsp in crystallin aggregation and cataract.

         <title>Boosting Antibiotic Efficacy of Azole Drugs against Methicillin&#8208;Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus by Coordination to Rhenium Carbonyl Complexes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination of antifungal azoles to rhenium di&#8208; and tricarbonyl complexes results in compounds with enhanced antimicrobial efficacy&#8212;up to 32&#8208;fold minimum inhibitory concentration improvement&#8212;against methicillin&#8208;sensitive and methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus over parent azoles. Cationic fac&#8208;[Re(CO)3]+ complexes are consistently more potent than cis&#8208;[Re(CO)2]+ species, with a ketoconazole derivative acting by disrupting membrane integrity.

Herein, a library of rhenium di&#8208; and tricarbonyl complexes featuring various antimicrobial azoles as monodentate ligands is synthesized and characterized. Their antimicrobial activity is evaluated against both methicillin&#8208;sensitive (MSSA) and methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and selected compounds are also assessed for cytotoxicity, yielding promising therapeutic indices. Notably, the complexation of antifungal azoles to the rhenium core enhances antimicrobial efficacy, with a compound exhibiting up to a 32&#8208;fold improvement in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values relative to the parent azole. Structure&#8211;activity relationships indicate that cationic fac&#8208;[Re(CO)3]+ complexes consistently outperform their cis&#8208;[Re(CO)2]+ counterparts, and mechanistic studies suggest that active complexes disrupt bacterial membrane integrity and interfere with the electron transport chain. Complementary small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and in silico analysis corroborate these findings, offering insights into the mechanism of action of this family of complexes.

         <title>Fucose&#8208;Based Glycopolymeric Nanomicelles for Activated Platelet&#8208;Targeted Photothermal Thrombolysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycopolymeric nanomicelles are designed with hydrophilic fucose segments for activated platelet&#8208;mediated targeting of thrombus, and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate core structure that enables the encapsulation of indocyanine green, thus, achieving precision photothermal thrombolysis.

Thrombotic disorders represent a significant global health burden, with conventional thrombolytic therapies often limited by systemic bleeding risks and inadequate thrombus specificity. To address these challenges, a biomimetic glycopolymer&#8208;based nanomicelle system is developed for precision thrombosis management. Utilizing reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer polymerization, a type of cationic glycopolymer is synthesized from dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate and fucose monomers, which self&#8208;assembles into core&#8208;shell nanomicelles. The hydrophilic corona features multivalent fucose clusters that selectively bind to P&#8208;selectin on activated platelets within the thrombi, enabling targeted accumulation, while the hydrophobic core encapsulates the photothermal agent indocyanine green (ICG), enhancing its aqueous solubility and photostability. Upon near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser irradiation, the ICG&#8208;loaded glycopolymeric nanomicelle, ICG@D20F20 exhibits efficient photothermal conversion, generating localized hyperthermia to disrupt fibrin networks. This platform offers several advantages, including precise targeting, synergistic thrombolysis, and enhanced biocompatibility, thereby overcoming the limitations of traditional thrombolytics and providing a novel approach for minimally invasive, image&#8208;guided cardiovascular interventions.

         <title>Identification of a l&#8208;Threonine&#8208;Utilizing Hydrazine Synthetase for Thrazarine Biosynthesis in Streptomyces coerulescens MH802&#8208;fF5</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A putative thrazarine biosynthetic gene cluster is discovered in the genome sequence of Streptomyces coerulescens MH802&#8208;fF5. In&#8201;vivo and in&#8201;vitro analyses of ThzN, a hydrazine synthetase with cupin and methionyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase&#8208;like domains encoded in the cluster, showed that it synthesizes a key intermediate of thrazarine by catalyzing condensation between l&#8208;threonine and N6&#8208;hydroxylysine, followed by intramolecular rearrangement.

Hydrazine synthetases (HSs), consisting of cupin and methionyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (MetRS)&#8208;like domains, catalyze hydrazine formation in the biosynthesis of various nitrogen&#63743;nitrogen (N&#63743;N) bond&#8208;containing secondary metabolites. The structural diversity of the N&#63743;N bond&#8208;containing secondary metabolites synthesized using this system is attributed to the diversity of amino acids (e.g., l&#8208;Glu, d&#8208;Glu, l&#8208;Ala, l&#8208;Tyr, l&#8208;Ser, and Gly) that are recognized by the MetRS domain. However, there are still many HS genes in the genome database whose substrates are unknown. This study identifies a putative biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) for thrazarine, a diazo group&#8208;containing secondary metabolite with antitumor activity, by whole&#8208;genome sequencing of the thrazarine producer Streptomyces coerulescens MH802&#8208;fF5. In&#8201;vivo and in&#8201;vitro analyses showed that ThzN, an HS encoded by this BGC, synthesizes N&#8208;((5&#8208;carboxy&#8208;5&#8208;(amino)pentyl)amino)threonine from l&#8208;Thr and N6&#8208;hydroxylysine. This is the first example of l&#8208;Thr&#8208;utilizing HS. Sequence alignment analysis and structure prediction using Boltz&#8208;1 indicated that the space near Gly417 is important for the accommodation of the threonine side chain. The comparison of thrazarine BGC with azaserine BGC indicated that the biosynthetic mechanism of the diazo group of thrazarine is different from that of azaserine. This study expands the diversity of HSs and provides new insights into the biosynthesis of diazo groups.

         <title>Pancatalytic Tumor Therapy by Ultrasound Activation of Inorganic Sonosensitizers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasound (US)&#8208;activated pancatalytic therapy mediated by sonosensitizers represents a paradigm shift, offering unprecedented spatial specificity and depth penetration capabilities. Herein, the state of US&#8208;activated pancatalytic tumor therapy is summarized, focusing on the classification and design principles of inorganic sonosensitizers, the cancer therapeutic efficacy enabled by sonocatalytic effect, and biosafety considerations for clinical use.

Pancatalytic therapy (PCT) is a comprehensive framework for disease management through the holistic control of catalytic and quasi&#8208;catalytic processes, including preparation (P) of catalysts, activation (A) of specific bio&#8208;effects, and nontoxic treatment (N) of different diseases. Ultrasound (US)&#8208;activated inorganic sonosensitizers have emerged as a powerful platform for pancatalytic tumor therapy, enabling precise and noninvasive cancer treatment through localized reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by the specific sonocatalytic mechanism. Upon exposure to US activation, inorganic sonosensitizers generate electron&#8211;hole pairs that produce sonocatalytic effect, generating cytotoxic ROS to induce oxidative damage in tumor cells. With ongoing advances in nanomaterial design and US technology, inorganic sonosensitizers represent a transformative approach for precision oncology, offering a versatile and clinically translatable solution for the emerging pancatalytic tumor eradication. This comprehensive review summarizes and highlights recent developments in different kinds of inorganic sonosensitizers and their specific application for pancatalytic tumor therapy. This review begins with providing an overview of inorganic sonosensitizers. The focus is then shifted to US&#8208;activated pancatalytic tumor therapy with high therapeutic efficacy. The biosafety and biospecificity of US&#8208;activated sonosensitizers in combating tumor are further discussed. Finally, the critical challenges and perspectives on potential directions for future clinical translation of this technology are presented.

         <title>Activity&#8208;Enhancing Mutations in an LmrR&#8208;Based Artificial Metalloenzyme Destabilize the Protein Scaffold and Alter its Conformational Plasticity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The protein LmrR is a versatile scaffold to design artificial metalloenzymes. Here, we show that the M8D/A92E (DE) mutations that result in a much more efficient catalyst, destabilize the protein dimerization interface and alter the conformation landscape when binding metal cofactor and substrates are shown. These results highlight the intricate relations between protein, metal cofactor, and substrates in defining catalytic efficiency.

Artificial metalloenzymes (ArM) hold great potential for the sustainable catalysis of complex new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reactions. To efficiently improve the catalytic efficacy of ArMs, a rational approach is desirable, requiring detailed molecular insight into their conformational landscape. Lactococcal multidrug resistance regulator (LmrR) is a multipurpose ArM scaffold protein that, when bound to the Cu(II)&#8208;phenanthroline cofactor, catalyzes the Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation (FCA) of indoles. Previously, the M8D and A92E mutations are found to increase the efficiency of this reaction, but a molecular explanation has been lacking. The impact of these two activating mutations on the conformational landscape of LmrR in its apo, cofactor&#8208; and substrate&#8208;bound states is determined. The mutations cause a marked destabilization of the dimerization interface, resulting in a more open central hydrophobic cavity and a dynamic equilibrium between dimer and monomer LmrR is found. While mutant and wild&#8208;type have similar pocket conformation in the cofactor&#8208;bound state, the mutant shows a distinct interaction with the substrate. Our results suggest that increased retention of the catalytic cofactor and widened plasticity improve the activity of the mutant. Ultimately, these results help elucidating the intricate relationships between conformational dynamics of the protein scaffold, cofactor, and substrates that define catalytic activity.

         <title>Reductant&#8208; or Light&#8208;Driven ATP&#8208;Independent Reduction of CO2 by Nitrogenase MoFe Protein</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogenases catalyze ATP&#8208;independent CO2&#8208;reduction to C1&#8211;C4 hydrocarbons in reactions driven by chemical reductants (EuII&#8211;DTPA) or light (quantum dots). MoFe and VFe proteins show higher activity in H2O and D2O, respectively, for the EuII&#8211;DTPA driven CO2&#8208;reduction to hydrocarbons. This atypical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;fuel Fischer&#8211;Tropsch type conversion offers a platform for mechanistic studies and the potential for designing sustainable CO2 recycling strategies.

Nitrogenase is a versatile metalloenzyme that activates and reduces small molecules like N2, CO, and CO2 into value&#8208;added chemicals at ambient conditions. Previously, it is shown that the Mo&#8208;nitrogenase could reduce CO2 to CO, but not to hydrocarbons, in an ATP&#8208;dependent reaction. Here, it is reported that the ability of the catalytic component of Mo&#8208;nitrogenase (MoFe protein) enables ATP&#8208;independent reduction of CO2 to up to C4 hydrocarbons in room&#8208;temperature reactions driven by a chemical reductant (EuII&#8211;DTPA) or visible light (via CdS@ZnS (CZS) quantum dots). Moreover, an opposite deuterium isotope effect is observed on the EuII&#8211;DTPA driven reactions of CO2 reduction by MoFe protein and its V&#8208;counterpart (VFe protein), in that the former displays higher activities in H2O, and the latter displays higher activities in D2O. These results provide an important foundation for further mechanistic exploration of the nitrogenase&#8208;enabled, atypical Fischer&#8211;Tropsch type reaction that uses CO2 instead of CO as a substrate; moreover, they serves as a potential template for the future development of nitrogenase&#8208;based applications that effectively recycle the greenhouse gas CO2 into valuable fuel products.

MoFe and VFe proteins show higher activity in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, respectively, for the Eu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;DTPA driven CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-reduction to hydrocarbons. This atypical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-fuel Fischer&#8211;Tropsch type conversion offers a platform for mechanistic studies and the potential for designing sustainable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; recycling strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrogenase is a versatile metalloenzyme that activates and reduces small molecules like N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into value-added chemicals at ambient conditions. Previously, it is shown that the Mo-nitrogenase could reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO, but not to hydrocarbons, in an ATP-dependent reaction. Here, it is reported that the ability of the catalytic component of Mo-nitrogenase (MoFe protein) enables ATP-independent reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to up to C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; hydrocarbons in room-temperature reactions driven by a chemical reductant (Eu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;DTPA) or visible light (via CdS@ZnS (CZS) quantum dots). Moreover, an opposite deuterium isotope effect is observed on the Eu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;DTPA driven reactions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction by MoFe protein and its V-counterpart (VFe protein), in that the former displays higher activities in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and the latter displays higher activities in D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. These results provide an important foundation for further mechanistic exploration of the nitrogenase-enabled, atypical Fischer&#8211;Tropsch type reaction that uses CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; instead of CO as a substrate; moreover, they serves as a potential template for the future development of nitrogenase-based applications that effectively recycle the greenhouse gas CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into valuable fuel products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functional Characterization of a Diazo&#8208;Forming Enzyme in Meroterpenoid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diazo&#8208;forming enzyme (stFur5) facilitates deamination in the biosynthesis of furaquinocins and other polyketide&#8208;derived meroterpenoids.

Meroterpenoids are known for their distinct structure and hybrid biosynthetic origin. The biosynthetic gene clusters of several well&#8208;characterized meroterpenoids contain three genes whose functions have remained elusive. Recent studies on nonmeroterpenoid pathways suggest that these genes may be involved in nitrite&#8208;dependent N&#63743;N bond formation. In this study, it is shown that one of these genes, stfur5, is essential for the biosynthesis of the representative meroterpenoid furaquinocin M. By leveraging a cell&#8208;free protein synthesis platform, it is found that stFur5 catalyzes the transformation of 8&#8208;amino&#8208;flaviolin (8&#8208;AF) into diazo&#8208;flaviolin, which subsequently undergoes nonenzymatic deamination to yield the downstream intermediate flaviolin. The findings suggest that stFur5, together with the nitrite&#8208;generating enzymes stFur15 and stFur16, facilitates the deamination of 8&#8208;AF via diazotization in furaquinocin biosynthesis. We&#160;further identified the nitrite&#8208;binding pocket within stFur5 and proposed a catalytic mechanism in which nitrite is activated through adenylation. The findings enrich the understanding of the role of diazo&#8208;forming enzymes in natural product biosynthesis.

         <title>Nonmetal Methoxy&#8208;Porphyrin Nanophotosensitizers: An Antitumor Agent for Photodynamic Therapy against Breast Cancer and Cervical Cancer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porphyrin photosensitizers exhibit excellent photodynamic antitumor effects. Their strong cytotoxicity and good antitumor efficacy at the cellular level make them potentially valuable for the treatment of breast cancer and cervical cancer, demonstrating broad&#8208;spectrum and high&#8208;efficiency activity.

With the continuous development of precision medicine and personalized treatment, traditional therapeutic approaches such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are increasingly unable to meet the ever&#8208;changing clinical needs. Therefore, developing highly efficient, low&#8208;toxicity, and well&#8208;targeted treatment strategies has become an urgent priority in cancer therapy. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has made significant strides in tumor treatment in recent years. Among the various materials used in PDT, porphyrin photosensitizers have emerged as one of the most utilized options due to their exceptional photodynamic activity, excellent targeting ability, low toxicity, and versatility. Here, this study selects nonmetal methoxy&#8208;porphyrin nanophotosensitizers as high&#8208;performance antitumor materials. Both in&#8201;vitro and in&#8201;vivo analyses demonstrate that these nanophotosensitizers efficiently generate reactive oxygen species, exhibiting significant cytotoxic effects at the cellular level. In tumor&#8208;bearing mouse models using 4T1 and HeLa cells, they show remarkable tumor inhibition, confirming their therapeutic potential in breast and cervical cancer models. Transcriptomic sequencing further reveals their regulatory roles in tumor&#8208;related signaling pathways. Overall, these findings highlight the exceptional antitumor properties of nonmetal methoxy&#8208;porphyrin nanophotosensitizers and provide foundational evidence for their application in PDT for gynecological malignancies.

         <title>Poly(ethylene Glycol)&#8208;Based Peptidomimetics (Pegtides) of Antimicrobial Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is commonly used to improve the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of therapeutic candidates by conjugation. Here PEG is exploited for peptidomimetic conversion of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), as candidate antibacterial agents, by replacing their polyamide backbone. The pegtides obtained thereby can be readily synthesized from inexpensive starting materials and demonstrate properties commensurate of AMP mimetics.

Cationic amphipathic poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;based polymers are generated with synthetic efficiencies allowing their evaluation as antimicrobial peptide (AMP) mimetics. Accordingly, statistical copolymers with cationic units consistently functionalized with guanyl groups, but different side&#8208;chain lengths, and hydrophobic units displaying long aliphatic, branched, and/or aromatic side chains are produced and tested for their antimicrobial and hemolytic properties. The results obtained indicate that candidates with activities and selectivity commensurate to some AMPs can be obtained and that further development of this novel type of antimicrobial peptidomimetics, pegtides, is warranted for clinical and/or biotechnological applications.

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of Trehalose&#8208;Based Mertansine Warheads for Bacillus Calmette&#8211;Gu&#233;rin Delivery of Anticancer Agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacillus Calmette&#8211;Gu&#233;rin (BCG) immunotherapy is the gold standard for nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). However, it is limited by adverse effects and resistance, despite eliciting a robust immune response. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study explores Antigen 85&#8208;mediated, metabolically with trehalose&#8208;PEG4 mertansine&#8208;labeled BCG as a novel treatment option for NMIBC, offering promising in cellulo results.

Nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) accounts for 75% of bladder cancer cases, with Bacillus Calmette&#8211;Gu&#233;rin (BCG) immunotherapy as the gold standard for high&#8208;risk patients. BCG elicits a robust immune response but is limited by adverse effects and resistance. To enhance its efficacy, a trehalose&#8208;based conjugation strategy is developed, tethering a cytostatic agent to BCG via a cleavable disulfide linker. This system enables selective drug integration into the BCG envelope and controlled release in tumor cells, aiming to improve therapeutic precision while minimizing toxicity. This approach combines immunotherapy with targeted chemotherapy, offering a promising strategy for NMIBC treatment.

This approach combines immunotherapy with targeted chemotherapy, offering a promising strategy for NMIBC treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cell Sensing via a Peptide/Single&#8208;Strand DNA Probe&#8208;Modified Au Screen&#8208;Printed Electrode</title>

         <dc:description>
A peptide/single&#8208;strand DNA&#8208;modified screen&#8208;printed electrode is constructed for the detection of human myeloid leukemia cells. KK1B10 aptamer and electron&#8208;transfer peptides are selected as cell recognition and sensing moieties. Target cells are sensed in a range of 5 to 200 cells&#8201;mL. The recoveries of cells in human serum and bovine blood are estimated using the Au screen&#8208;printed electrode and are 99%&#8211;102%. Accordingly, the proposed method can be applied to the detection of target cells.

An electron&#8208;transfer/His&#8208;tag peptides&#8208;single&#8208;strand (ss) DNA probe is designed for the detection of cancer cells. Human myeloid leukemia cells (K562 cells) are commonly used as a model for target cancer cells. An electron&#8208;transfer peptide plays the role of a sensing moiety, and a His&#8208;tag moiety is introduced to purify the probe. A KK1B10 aptamer conjugated with the peptide sequence as an ss&#8208;DNA with target cell recognition properties is used. A probe with cysteine residue at the N&#8208;terminals is then immobilized on an Au screen&#8208;printed electrode (AuSPE). To evaluate the effect of the amino acid sequence in the probe, three types of probes are synthesized. The acetylated(Ac)&#8208;CYYCYYCH6&#8208;amino modifier C6(AmC6)KK1B10 aptamer probe proves to be a superior version. The K562 cells can interact with the probe on the electrode, and the electrode responses of the probe are decreased with increases in the concentrations of the cells. The peak currents are proportional to the concentrations of the cells and ranges from 5 to 200 cells&#8201;mL with a detection limit of 2 cells/mL. The recovery 99%&#8211;102% of K562 cells in human serum and bovine blood is calculated using the probe&#8208;modified AuSPE. Consequently, the proposed method can be applied to the detection of target cells.

         <title>An Oxyprenylated Phenylpropanoid Pharmacologic Scaffold for SelU Inhibition</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small library of natural oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids is investigated as potential inhibitors of tRNA 2&#8208;selenouridine synthase (MnmH, also called SelU), a member of the Mnm family of enzymes that modify uridine at the wobble position of specific tRNAs. Screening each compound against the N&#8208;terminal domain of SelU via fluorescence quenching methodology reveals details of substrate binding mode and conformational flexibility of this enzyme.

MnmH, better known as tRNA 2&#8208;selenouridine synthase (SelU), is a member of the Mnm family enzymes that work in concert to modify uridine at the wobble position. Instrumental in maintaining base pair fidelity and exclusive to bacteria, SelU is a promising drug target. Although no molecular structure has been experimentally calculated, insights into this enzyme's mechanism of catalysis have been empirically gleaned and proven useful for ligand&#8208;based rational drug design. In this study, a small group of natural and semisynthetic oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids were selected based on their compositional resemblance to the purported SelU ligands. Specifically, these compounds contained one or more geranyl groups branching from aromatic frameworks, all of which are believed to heighten affinity to SelU. Meticulous screening of each compound against an N&#8208;terminal SelU construct via fluorescence quenching of W83 further reveals details on the enzyme&#8208;substrate binding mode. Conformational flexibility of residues around W83 is suggested by the slow bimolecular quenching constants calculated for each compound. This is consistent with the single binding site and the blend of interaction&#8208;types calculated at the active site. Lastly, this general oxyprenylated framework, along with a cinnamic acid moiety, is established as a pharmacologic scaffold that can be further optimized into potential antibiotics.

         <title>Engineering of Amyloid Mimicking Peptide Modulating Side&#8208;Chain Polarity of Aromatic Amino Acid Residue</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective tuning of side chain polarity in an aromatic peptide results supramolecular nanofibrils having amyloidogenic property. These nanofibrils also can arrest solvent molecules leading to sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel phase transition. Interestingly, the hydrogel material is mechanically robust and thixotropic in nature. 

Triggering higher order assembly, peptides form a number of nanoscale architectures. Self&#8208;assembly of phenylalanine homopeptides and its derivatives have been studied extensively, but the supramolecular assembly of aromatic peptides in interplay with side chain polarity is yet to be understood. Herein, the p&#8208;nitrophenylalanine, H&#8208;Phe(p&#8208;NO2)&#8208;OH, a chemically modified aromatic amino acid, has been shuffled in a highly aromatic peptide, Boc&#8208;Phe&#8208;Phe&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH (P1), which results three mutated analogs having different polarity. The morphological investigation reveals that except Boc&#8208;Phe(p&#8208;NO2)&#8208;Phe&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH (P2), all peptides aggregate into supramolecular nanofibrils in aqueous solution. The long entangled nanofibrils formed by Boc&#8208;Phe&#8208;Phe(p&#8208;NO2)&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH (P3) are able to arrest the solvent molecules leading to &#8220;sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel&#8221; phase transition. Interestingly, the hydrogel is mechanically robust and the gel fibrils are amyloidogenic in nature. Conformational analysis reveals the presence of cross&#8208;&#946; arrangement of the &#946;&#8208;strand in the gel fibrils. The rheological studies explore the thixotropic property of the self&#8208;supported hydrogel matrix. The studies establish that the supramolecular interactions can be tuned modulating the side&#8208;chain polarity of the amino acid residues. Overall, it paves a new paradigm to fabricate peptide&#8208;based biomaterials for imminent applications.

         <title>Genome Mining Reveals a Novel Nephthenol&#8208;Producing Diterpene Synthase from the Sandfly Lutzomyia Longipalpis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of a terpene synthase of insect origin that makes the apparently cryptic product nephthenol from geranylgeranyl diphosphate sheds light on hidden biosynthetic potential.

Populations of the sandfly, Lutzomyia longipalpis, use the diterpene sobralene as a sex/aggregation pheromone, which is likely produced in the insect through the activity of a recently discovered noncanonical terpene synthase (TPS). This study shows that the genome of this insect also contains another noncanonical TPS able to produce principally (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;nephthenol (isoserratol) from geranylgeranyl diphosphate. This diterpene alcohol does not appear to be produced by the sandfly, nor is the corresponding TPS gene transcribed, hence these findings suggest that insects may be a promising source of TPSs for apparently cryptic terpenoid products.

         <title>Robotic&#8208;Assisted Capture&#8208;Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment of RNA Aptamers Binding to Small Molecules</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the rapid selection of RNA aptamers that can target various small molecules through a newly established automated capture&#8208;systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment technique. Throughout the study, this method is applied to aptamer selection for several small molecules, resulting in aptamers that bind with high specificity. The affinity of these aptamers is assessed using fluorescence polarization assays and isothermal calorimetry.

Due to their small size, stability, and cost&#8208;effectiveness compared to antibodies, aptamers developed by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) are promising candidates for the detection of small molecules. In SELEX, a small target molecule is usually covalently immobilized on a surface to separate bound from unbound nucleic acid sequences. However, this immobilization alters the molecule, that is, additional chemical entities are added and the electron distribution is altered, compromising the enrichment properties. To overcome this problem, a capture SELEX method has been successfully developed in which the RNA or DNA libraries are bound to a surface via a complementary oligodeoxynucleotide, and the soluble ligand is used to capture nucleic acids that bind to it from that surface. Herein, the development of an automated version of the capture SELEX method for the identification of RNA aptamers that bind small molecules is described. This method is fully automated and performs up to 12 iterative selection cycles without manual interference in 72&#8201;h. The approach is therefore suitable as rapid route to aptamers and enables resource&#8208;efficient test selections to assess &#8220;aptamerogenicity&#8221; of a target.

However, this immobilization alters the molecule, that is, additional chemical entities are added and the electron distribution is altered, compromising the enrichment properties. To overcome this problem, a capture SELEX method has been successfully developed in which the RNA or DNA libraries are bound to a surface via a complementary oligodeoxynucleotide, and the soluble ligand is used to capture nucleic acids that bind to it from that surface. Herein, the development of an automated version of the capture SELEX method for the identification of RNA aptamers that bind small molecules is described. This method is fully automated and performs up to 12 iterative selection cycles without manual interference in 72&#8201;h. The approach is therefore suitable as rapid route to aptamers and enables resource-efficient test selections to assess &#8220;aptamerogenicity&#8221; of a target.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>RNAs play crucial roles in various cellular actions, and the uncontrolled expression or improper folding of RNAs is a cause of many diseases. Certain oncogenic phenotypes stem from the overexpression of regulatory microRNAs that contain secondary structural elements. Thus, targeting disease&#8208;related microRNAs with small molecules is a potential anticancer strategy that has attracted growing interest. To probe the RNA&#8208;binding chemical space held in advanced small&#8208;molecule therapeutics, we screened the 78 FDA&#8208;approved small&#8208;molecule kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) for their binding affinity with pre&#8208;let&#8208;7&#160;miRNA via a combination of computational methods and biophysical measurement. The best&#8208;ranked SMKIs based on docking scores were subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies. Collectively, it provided reliable information on the binding affinity for the top&#8208;performed SMKI in the formation of SMKI&#8211;miRNA complexes with pre&#8208;let&#8208;7.&#160;Furthermore, the identification of the predicted most promising SMKI&#8211;miRNA interactions was validated by microscale thermophoresis. This study highlighted the necessity to characterize the biological targets of SMKIs, many of which are FDA&#8208;approved cancer agents, at the transcriptomic level with RNAs. The study also illustrates the possibility that the interaction with RNA targets may contribute to the observed biological and clinical performance of these approved SMKIs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In order to develop new metal&#8208;based glycoconjugates as potential anticancer agents, three gold(III)&#8208;dithiocarbamato glycoconjugates of the type [AuIIIBr2(SSC&#8208;Inp&#8208;GlcN)] (Au3&#8208;5), their gold(I)&#8208;phosphine counterparts [AuI(SSC&#8208;Inp&#8208;GlcN)(PPh3)] (AuP3&#8208;5) and gold(I)&#8208;carbene analogues [AuI(SSC&#8208;Inp&#8208;GlcN)(Et2BzImy)] (AuC3&#8208;5) (Inp: isonipecotic moiety; GlcN: amino&#8208;glucose scaffold; Et2BzImy: 1,3&#8208;diethylbenzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene moiety), as well as the corresponding non&#8208;glycosylated counterparts (Au1&#8208;2, AuP1&#8208;2 and AuC1&#8208;2) bearing a terminal ester or amide function, were generated and characterized by means of several analytical techniques (FT&#8208;IR, 1H&#8208;/13C&#8208;NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, X&#8208;ray crystallography). Their stability under physiologically&#8208;relevant conditions (PBS solution) has also been evaluated.

         <title>Developing FGF2 Mutants with Selectively Reduced Heparan Sulfate Affinity to Explore Their Impact on FGFR1 Signaling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) regulates signal transduction by forming complexes with its receptors, FGF receptors (FGFRs), and heparan sulfate (HS), playing a crucial role in biological systems. Although HS has been suggested to modulate FGF/FGFR signaling as a co&#8208;receptor, multiple hypotheses exist regarding how HS affects FGF/FGFR signaling, and the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, to highlight the role of FGF2/HS interaction in FGF2/FGFR1 signaling, FGF2 mutants with reduced HS&#8208;binding affinity were rationally designed through&#160;in silico&#160;analysis. These FGF2 mutants exhibited reduced HS affinity by more than two orders of magnitude while maintaining binding affinity to FGFR1. In addition, these mutants retained their thermal stability. Cellular assays using the FGF2 mutant suggested that, contrary to previous reports, the contribution of the FGF2/HS interaction in FGF2/FGFR1 signaling may be limited. The mutant FGFs that specifically alter the interaction with HS, achieved in this study, would contribute to an understanding of the role of FGF/HS interaction in FGF/FGFR signaling.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Characterization of Prodrugged Anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 Antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Therapeutic antibodies are widely used to treat diseases like cancer and inflammatory conditions by binding with high specificity to their molecular targets. Masking is a strategy to mitigate undesirable activity in non&#8208;target tissues, improving safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles by reducing target&#8208;mediated drug disposition (TMDD). In this study, we explored masking an anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 antibody by conjugating a large PEG molecule to specific sites on the antibody. While anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 immunotherapy benefits solid tumor treatment, its adverse events limit its utility. We evaluated multiple conjugation sites within the complementarity&#8208;determining regions (CDRs) and adjacent framework regions to attenuate CTLA&#8208;4 binding. We identified the optimal site for maximizing masking efficiency, allowing for efficient bioconjugation and functional restoration upon exposure to a cleaving enzyme in the tumor microenvironment. The prodrugged antibody exhibited reduced binding to CTLA&#8208;4 and Fc gamma receptors (FcgRs), high stability, and an extended half&#8208;life in a mouse model. This technology has the potential to improve the PK profile and safety attributes of therapeutic antibodies.</dc:description>

         <title>Internal Ubiquitin Electrophiles for Covalent Trapping and Inhibition of Deubiquitinases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ubiquitin (Ub) system governs vital cellular processes in eukaryotic biology through an intricate network of Ub&#8208;protein interactions. While semisynthetic C&#8208;terminal Ub electrophiles (UbEs) are widely used to study Ub transfer and deubiquitinase (Dub) activity, they are limited to probing the active site while leaving other functionally important sites unexplored. Building on previously identified multivalent interaction interfaces and potential allosteric sites which are key to understanding their dynamic nature, here we report the development of genetically encoded Ub&#8208;based probes to covalently tether Ub&#8208;protein interactions in a proximity driven manner at distal locations away from the active site. This study demonstrates that UbEs with internal electrophiles maintain conformational changes observed with their C&#8208;terminal counterparts while circumventing their limitations in capturing distal binding&#8208;site complexes, an emerging feature in Ub&#8208;mediated regulation. Genetically encoding these electrophiles further demonstrate rational variation as activity&#8208;based probes (ABP), leading to a Met1&#8208;diUb ABP showing preference for OTULIN over other Met1 cleaving Dubs. Taken together, our study introduces genetically encoded Ub&#8208;based probes to explore the structural and biochemical significance of Ub&#8208;Dub interactions beyond the canonical S1 site, overcoming some limitations of traditional Ub C&#8208;terminal electrophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Biosynthetic Studies of Sordarin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent breakthroughs characterize the biosynthesis of fungal antibiotic sordarin. The pathway begins with terpenoid scaffold formation. Four successive cytochrome P450&#8208;mediated oxidations cascade, including a key C&#63743;C bond cleavage. A distinct Diels&#8211;Alderase enzyme SdnG then stereoselectively builds the norbornene core. Late&#8208;stage biosynthesis involves glycosyl transferase&#8208;catalyzed sugar attachment and further redox tailoring, producing the antibiotic.

Sordarin, a structurally distinct natural product&#8208;derived antifungal antibiotic targeting eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2, has undergone extensive biosynthetic characterizations in recent studies. This review highlights key advances in understanding its biosynthesis.

&lt;p&gt;Recent breakthroughs characterize the biosynthesis of fungal antibiotic sordarin. The pathway begins with terpenoid scaffold formation. Four successive cytochrome P450-mediated oxidations cascade, including a key C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;C bond cleavage. A distinct Diels&#8211;Alderase enzyme SdnG then stereoselectively builds the norbornene core. Late-stage biosynthesis involves glycosyl transferase-catalyzed sugar attachment and further redox tailoring, producing the antibiotic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sordarin, a structurally distinct natural product-derived antifungal antibiotic targeting eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2, has undergone extensive biosynthetic characterizations in recent studies. This review highlights key advances in understanding its biosynthesis. These insights offer critical pathways for designing next-generation antifungal agents to address emerging resistance mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatiotemporal Analysis of Proteins in Single Live Cells: Methods and Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced imaging and molecular labeling techniques for spatiotemporal protein analysis in single live cells are reviewed. This article assesses how these cutting&#8208;edge tools unveil protein localization, dynamics, and functional interactions. Technical challenges, future prospects, and transformative applications in precision medicine and systems biology are discussed.

The spatio&#8208;temporal detection of proteins in living cells has always been an ongoing challenge. This complexity stems from the dynamic nature of the cellular environment, in which proteins interact in a highly regulated manner. Some innovative methods collectively represent important advances in overcoming the challenges associated with spatiotemporal detection of proteins in living cells. They are essential for elucidating cell biology and advancing therapeutic diagnostic techniques. However, the spatio&#8208;temporal organization of living intracellular vessels still lacks sufficient characterization. At present, there is a lack of review articles that comprehensively review the progress in recent years. This review aims to fill this gap by providing a broad overview of protein analysis in single living cells. In this review, the recent technical advances in the spatio&#8208;temporal analysis of proteins in single living cells are investigated, and the prospects and challenges in this direction are briefly discussed.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Sufficient &#946;&#8208;Methylarginine Biosynthetic Pathway in Planctomycetes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A genome&#8208;mining approach identifies a novel biosynthetic gene cluster for &#946;&#8208;methylarginine in the phylum Planctomycetes. Functional characterization of the transaminase PlaA and methyltransferase PlaB reveals a self&#8208;sufficient enzyme cascade for &#946;&#8208;methylarginine biosynthesis. These findings broaden the biocatalytic tools for &#946;&#8208;methyl amino acids production and highlight Planctomycetes as an untapped source of specialized metabolites.

&#946;&#8208;Methyl amino acids (&#946;&#8208;MAAs) enhance the bioactivity of natural products and possess intrinsic pharmacological properties as free amino acids. While the biosynthetic capacity for this class of noncanonical amino acids has been established in certain bacterial lineages such as Gammaproteobacteria and Actinomycetes, other bacterial phyla remain largely unexplored. A genome&#8208;mining&#8208;guided discovery of a novel biosynthetic gene cluster capable of producing &#946;&#8208;methylarginine, from the phylum Planctomycetes is reported. Both in&#8201;vivo and in&#8201;vitro evidence indicates that Planctomycetes employ a transaminase (PlaA) and a methyltransferase (PlaB) to synthesize this &#946;&#8208;MAA. Unlike previously described &#946;&#8208;methylarginine biosynthetic pathways, PlaA and PlaB function as a self&#8208;sufficient enzyme cascade that operates without the need for additional keto acid and amino acid partners. These findings expand the catalytic repertoire for &#946;&#8208;MAAs biosynthesis and establish Planctomycetes as a new source of secondary metabolites discovery.

         <title>Local and Global Behavior of Unfolded and Intrinsically Disordered Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ramachandran plots of amino acid residues of short peptides show that the sampled conformational space is smaller than assumed by the classical random coil model. At variance withthe latter, it depends on the type of nearest neighbor in a polypeptide chain. . Considering nearest neighbor interactions is pivotal for reproducing conformational distributions of unfolded and intrinsically disordered proteins.

Intrinsically disordered and artificially denatured foldable proteins have many properties in common, even though the distribution of amino acid residues generally differ. Both are traditionally described as either adopting molten globule or random coil&#8208;like structure, depending on their amino acid composition. For a long period of time, it was believed that with the exception of glycine and proline, conformational preferences of individual amino acid residues are very similar, and therefore, not of great concern. This article discusses experimental and bioinformatical data which show that individual Ramachandran plot distributions in unfolded proteins depend on the characteristics of side chains. Furthermore, ample experimental evidence suggests the presence of nearest neighbor interactions between residues which are ignored in the classical random coil model. The article reviews and discusses work that emphasizes the necessity of a thorough understanding of the local behavior of disordered and unfolded proteins alike for an understanding of the coiled state of proteins. Unresolved issues are delineated and research perspectives suggested.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Route toward a De&#8201;Novo Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (S)&#8208;Baclofen Based on Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroformylation and Enzymatic Transamination</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique chemoenzymatic synthesis route toward (S)&#8208;baclofen is presented, which highlights a hydroformylation and biocatalysis step toward the synthesis of such a challenging &#946;&#8208;chiral amino acid. The shown methodology exhibits high conversions and enantiomeric excess and is transferable to other &#946;&#8208;chiral amines and amino acids.

This study explores the chemoenzymatic synthesis of (S)&#8208;baclofen, which involves a sequential combination of transition metal catalysis and biocatalysis. The synthesis approach starts from a readily accessible cinnamic acid ester that is converted using a rhodium&#8208;based hydroformylation catalyst toward the corresponding chiral aldehyde. This compound is subsequently converted via a transaminase&#8208;catalyzed reaction system that yields the desired &#946;&#8208;chiral amino acid ester and the final free &#946;&#8208;chiral amino acid (S)&#8208;baclofen after a simple hydrolysis reaction. This synthesis concept does provide high atom efficiency and does not require an additional chiral resolution step of a racemic product.

         <title>Covalent Stabilization of Collagen Mimetic Triple Helices and Assemblies by Dopa Crosslinking</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Creating thermally stable collagen mimetic peptides (CMPs) is a persistent challenge. Nature leverages covalent crosslinkings to stabilize collagen's triple helix&#160;and higher&#8208;order assemblies. Herein, we demonstrate that crosslinkings between levodopa (Dopa) and lysine can covalently stabilize the triple helix in collagen mimetic peptides. Since alkaline conditions catalyze the oxidation of the catechol on Dopa to a benzoquinone, while being in proximity to the nucleophilic lysine, we hypothesized that this reaction could be a facile method to covalently capture the supramolecular structure of CMPs by simply increasing the pH of the aqueous solvent with the addition of sodium hydroxide. This strategy covalently stabilizes CMP homotrimers and a de novo designed ABC&#8208;type heterotrimer demonstrating that the Lysine&#8208;Dopa covalent bond is best templated by a supramolecular, axial cation&#8208;&#960; pairwise interaction. In nature, collagen can hierarchically assemble into fibers. This behavior can be mimicked with the self&#8208;assembly of CMPs, but the resulting nanofibers typically exhibit thermal stability below body temperature. In a final application, we demonstrate that Dopa&#8208;Lysine covalent capture also enhances the thermal stability of CMP nanofibers well above 37 &#176;C. This biomimetic covalent capture strategy can stabilize a wide variety of CMP systems and potentially enable the biomedical application of these materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Adding a C&#8208;terminal amino acid prevents the conformational interconversion of plecanatide analogues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The principle of structure dictating properties is illustrated by the direct correlation between cyclic peptide conformation and their biological efficacy.&#160;Plecanatide, a synthetic analogue of uroguanylin, has received FDA approval for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS&#8208;C).&#160;Nevertheless, our investigation has revealed that plecanatide undergoes slow conformational interconversion&#160;in slightly acidic conditions.&#160;In response, we strategically incorporated propargylglycine at the carboxyl terminal of plecanatide, a modification that not only facilitates additional functionalization and derivatization but also confers exceptional conformational stability.&#160;Remarkably, the resulting&#160;isomers not only maintained long&#8208;term conformational stability but also exhibited&#160;either preserved or slightly enhanced agonistic activity.&#160;This discovery represents a contribution to drug research focused on plecanatide, particularly in elucidating the relationship between its conformational properties and biological activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Biosynthesis of Polyhydroxybutyrate from Xylose via an In Vitro Synthetic Enzymatic Biosystem with Self&#8208;Sustained Cofactor Regeneration</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In vitro biotransformation (ivBT) mediated by in vitro synthetic enzymatic biosystems (ivSEBs) represents a highly promising platform for sustainable biomanufacturing, offering enhanced reaction efficiency by circumventing cellular constraints. In this study, we developed an ivSEB comprising 17 enzymes for the cell&#8208;free biosynthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) from D&#8208;xylose via the acetyl&#8208;coenzyme A. This ivSEB integrates partial glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, enabling self&#8208;sustained balance of several cofactors including coenzyme A (CoA), NADP+/NADPH and ATP/ADP. Stoichiometric analysis demonstrated a theoretical molar yield of PHB from xylose of 111.1%. Through optimizing concentrations of cofactors and enzymes, the one&#8208;pot reaction produced 44.0 mM (3.8 g/L) PHB from 44.8 mM (6.7 g/L) xylose, corresponding to a molar yield of 98.2%. Even at a higher substrate concentration (13.5 g/L), the yield remained robust (84.5%). This study demonstrated the potential of ivSEB as a scalable and efficient approach for the large&#8208;scale production of PHB and other xylose&#8208;based or acetyl&#8208;CoA&#8208;derived chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;triggered Hyaluronic Acid Hydrogel for 3D Culture and Cell Recovery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Properties of semi&#8208;synthetic hydrogels can be fine&#8208;tuned making these attractive for various applications in regenerative medicine. Here, we describe a hydrogel platform based on hyaluronic acid (HA) modified by (1R,8S,9S)&#8208;bicycle[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;9&#8208;ylmethanol (BCN) and a cross&#8208;linker composed of light sensitive o&#8208;nitrobenzyl and polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains terminating in azides. The two components can undergo strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) resulting in rapid gel formation. First, we incorporated adipose&#8208;derived mesenchymal stromal cells (aMSCs) in the hydrogel and demonstrated that the cells can be easily retrieved by UV light mediated degradation maintaining viability and retaining spindle&#8208;like shape when the cells were replated. Next, we provided a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of inducing light&#8208;mediated softening of the hydrogel to modulate the morphology of the encapsulated cells. A co&#8208;culture of endothelial cells (cord blood&#8208;derived endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) and bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (bmMSCs), which are commonly studied for their ability to form capillary&#8208;like vascular networks, were cultured in the regular and light induced softened hydrogels. Non&#8208;photoexposed hydrogels showed cells with a prevalently rounded morphology, whereas stretched cells connecting into a primitive capillary network were observed in the light&#8208;softened hydrogels. Photo&#8208;induced softening offers potential to locally control cell shape and self&#8208;organization capacity.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Substrate Flexibility of GrsB Thioesterase Leads to the Structural Reassignment of a Gramicidin S Variant</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gramicidin S (GS) is a cyclic decapeptide derived from two pentapeptides. The C&#8208;terminal thioesterase (TE) domain of gramicidin S synthetase B (GrsB) dimerizes precursor pentapeptides and cyclizes the resulting linear decapeptide. Recently, a GS variant (GS&#8208;SA), in which a single D&#8208;Phe was replaced by L&#8208;Ser(Allyl), was reported via precursor&#8208;directed biosynthesis in a native GS producer. To understand how GrsB&#8208;TE processes such modified precursors, we investigated its substrate specificity using synthetic linear peptides. GrsB&#8208;TE cyclized a substrate containing L&#8208;Ser(Allyl) at position 6 but not at position 1. However, the enzymatically synthesized GS&#8208;SA showed a different HPLC retention time than that of the reported GS variant. Further structural and functional analyses, including 1H NMR, antimicrobial assays, and circular dichroism spectroscopy, revealed that the reported GS&#8208;SA contained D&#8208;Ser(Allyl) rather than L&#8208;Ser(Allyl). These findings reveal a previously unrecognized stereochemical flexibility in GrsB&#8208;TE and support the structural revision of the reported GS variant.</dc:description>

         <title>Matrix&#8208;Assisted Efficient Selection of a High&#8208;Affinity Circular Aptamer for Sensitive Detection of Low&#8208;Density Lipoprotein in Human Serum</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The accurate and rapid detection of&#160;human serum biomakers is crucial&#160;for the early diagnosis of related diseases. Circular aptamers emerge as promising candidates for the precise recognition of these&#160;biomakers due to their remarkable biological and structural stability. In this study, we successfully identified a high&#8208;affinity circular DNA aptamer for Low&#8208;density lipoprotein (LDL), a key biomarker for cardiovascular diseases, through matrix&#8208;assisted efficient selection strategy&#160;conducted directly in human serum.&#160;This circular aptamer demonstrated&#160;a dissociation constant (Kd) as low as 18 nM&#160;and exhibited exceptional specificity for LDL, showing&#160;negligible responses to closely related analogs such as&#160;high&#8208;density lipoprotein and other abunzaidant human serum substances. We subsequently developed a sensitive aptasensor that utilizes the superior recognition capability of the circular DNA aptamer, which performed&#160;well&#160;even in human serum&#160;(with a limit of detection&#160;down to 0.4 &#956;M and a wide&#160;linear concentration range of three orders of magnitude). This work underscores the feasibility of&#160;rapidly isolating&#160;highly functional circular DNA aptamers in one selection round, thereby&#160;accelerating the discovery of various circular DNA aptamers that are&#160;well&#8208;suited for molecular recognition of a wide array&#160;of emerging human serum biomarkers.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination Polymer Carrying Antimicrobial Peptide for Enhanced Anti&#8208;Infective Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CP&#8208;1 might be a valuable carrier for DGL 13K, improving its stability and promoting membrane disruption. This presents a viable approach to creating new antimicrobial treatments to fight drug resistance, especially against Gram&#8208;negative bacteria.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) offer a promising avenue for combating drug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections, but their clinical utility is often limited by poor bioavailability and stability. This study presents the design and synthesis of a novel, enantiomerically pure 2D&#8208;coordination polymer, {[Cu(dUMP)(dpp)2]&#183;3(H2O)&#183;(NO3)]}n (CP&#8208;1), derived from Cu(II) ions, deoxy&#8208;uridine monophosphate, and 1,3&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)propane (dpp), as a potential delivery system for AMPs. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals a 2D double helical structure with square pyramidal Cu(II) coordination. Spectroscopic characterization (IR, UV&#8211;vis, thermogravimetric analysis, X&#8208;ray diffraction, circular dichroism) confirms the successful synthesis and reveals chirality transfer to the achiral dpp ligand. Molecular docking studies identify DGL 13K as the AMP exhibiting the strongest binding affinity to CP&#8208;1 (&#916;G&#8201;=&#8201;&#8722;13.03&#8201;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Critically, molecular dynamics simulations provide detailed insights into the mechanism of action of the CP&#8208;1&#8211;DGL 13K complex against a Gram&#8208;negative bacterial membrane. The simulations demonstrate that DGL 13K, stabilized by CP&#8208;1, undergoes conformational changes, penetrating the membrane and disrupting its integrity through pore formation. These findings highlight the potential of CP&#8208;1 as an effective carrier for AMPs, enhancing their stability and facilitating membrane disruption, offering a promising strategy for developing novel antimicrobial therapies to combat drug resistance.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Photochemical Biology of Serotonin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The neurotransmitter serotonin influences a wide range of behaviors and biological processes through a series of serotonin receptors and transporters. Recent photochemical tools have made it possible to follow this complicated web of interactions with ever improving spatial and temporal resolution.

Serotonin (5&#8208;HT) is an endogenous neurotransmitter that plays a key role in cellular signaling. Its interactions with serotonin receptors (5&#8208;HTRs) and the serotonin transporter (SERT) influence processes as disparate as hunger, happiness, healing, and headaches. Over the last several decades, photochemical tools have been developed to observe, track, and modulate these serotonin&#8211;protein interactions. The tools tend to fit into one of four categories: photoswitches, photocages, photobiosensors, or photocross&#8208;linkers. This review examines the development and application of these photochemical tools for 5&#8208;HT, 5&#8208;HTRs, and SERT over the last &#8776;10&#8201;years, with an emphasis on the chemistry involved.

         <title>Development of Antibody&#8208;Based Strategies&#160;for Targeted Degradation of Membrane and Extracellular Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane and extracellular proteins are essential components in various biological processes that ensure cellular function and homeostasis. Their dysregulation is linked to a wide range of diseases, making them pivotal therapeutic targets. Recent innovations in therapeutic strategies have concentrated on targeted protein degradation, particularly via the endocytosis&#8208;lysosome pathway, offering a novel approach to restoring balance within cellular systems. This review elucidates recent advancements in antibody&#8208;based therapeutics designed for the targeted degradation of membrane and extracellular proteins, specifically emphasizing three key mechanisms: lysosomal targeting receptors, transmembrane E3 ligases, and lysosome&#8208;sorting signals that facilitate the degradation of disease&#8208;relevant proteins. We focus on various construction strategies for these antibody&#8208;based therapeutics, highlighting the potential of antibody&#8208;ligand conjugates, bispecific antibodies, and antibody fusion proteins. By leveraging the natural endocytic pathway for efficient protein internalization and subsequent lysosomal degradation, these antibody&#8208;based platforms hold significant promise for developing targeted therapies for a variety of diseases. Through this review, we aim to provide insights into the exciting field of antibody&#8208;enabled lysosomal degradation and its implications for future therapeutic interventions.</dc:description>

         <title>Chromenone Derivatives as CRM1 Inhibitors for Targeting Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chromenone derivatives are synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of chromosome region maintenance 1&#8208;mediated nuclear export, targeting glioblastoma cells. Active compounds demonstrate structure&#8208; and dose&#8208;dependent inhibition, supported by structure&#8211;activity relationships and molecular docking studies. Selected analogs induce nuclear retention of endogenous proteins, show selective cytotoxicity against glioblastoma cell lines, and highlight promising potential for targeted cancer therapy.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive and deadly cancers. Due to the complexity and redundancy within signaling networks in GBM, targeted inhibitors of specific pathways have shown only limited success. The nuclear export receptor chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1) has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic target, as its inhibition can simultaneously disrupt multiple key oncogenic drivers. Herein, whether chromenone derivatives, known for detecting thiol&#8208;containing molecules, can function as CRM1 inhibitors is explored. Several chromenone&#8208;based derivatives are synthesized and it is demonstrated that they inhibit CRM1&#8208;driven nuclear export in a structure&#8208; and dose&#8208;dependent manner. A preliminary structure&#8211;activity relationship is established, providing a rationale for selective CRM1 binding based on molecular docking studies. Additionally, it is showed that the active chromenone derivatives effectively inhibit the nuclear export of endogenous nuclear export signal&#8208;containing substrates in GBM cells. Several of these compounds exhibit selective cytotoxicity against GBM cell lines, highlighting their potential as targeted therapies for GBM.

         <title>Pathological Disulfide Bond Crosslinking: Molecular Insights into Amyloidogenesis and Diseases Progression</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores pathological disulfide&#8208;crosslinking as a key driver of amyloidogenic protein misfolding and aggregation. Oxidative and ER stress pathways contributing to disease progression are discussed and emerging therapeutic strategies targeting disulfide&#8208;linked aggregates in neurodegenerative and systemic amyloid diseases are examined.

Amyloidogenesis is a complex process in which normally soluble proteins misfold and assemble into &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich aggregates known as amyloid fibrils. This pathological process is implicated in a broad range of diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and systemic amyloidosis. Recent studies indicate that disulfide&#8208;crosslinking plays a central role in promoting protein aggregation by stabilizing misfolded intermediates. This review highlights the cellular pathways leading to abnormal disulfide bond formation and examines their impact on disease progression. Additionally, a discussion is made on how disulfide&#8208;crosslinked oligomeric species resist degradation, overwhelm proteostasis systems, and serve as precursors for amyloid fibrils. By understanding the role of disulfide crosslinks in protein aggregation, insights into amyloid pathogenesis are gained and potential therapeutic targets for intervention are identified.

         <title>5&#8208;thiohistidine N&#8208;acetyltransferase from Proteiniphilum saccharofermentans</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ovothiol A is a 5&#8208;thiohistidine derivative biosynthesized by a broad range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Its redox&#8208;active mercaptoimidazole side chain is believed to protect cells from oxidative stress. The three enzymes that produce ovothiol A from histidine, cysteine, and&#160;S&#8208;adenosyl methionine have been identified and characterized. In contrast, no enzymes are known that produce other 5&#8208;thiohistidine derivatives. Here, we describe a small family of acetyl&#8208;coenzyme A&#8208;dependent transferases that produce&#160;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;5&#8208;thiohistidine. The discovery of these enzymes from&#160;Proteiniphilum saccharofermentans&#160;and related Bacteroidota provides evidence that the 5&#8208;thiohistidine class may be structurally and functionally more diverse than previously thought.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Autonomous cells are engineered biological systems capable of biosynthesising and directly incorporating non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins. These systems have the potential to extend the applicability of the genetic code to enable large&#8208;scale fermentative production of proteins carrying ncAAs. This work evaluates approaches for the generation of autonomous and semi&#8208;autonomous cells. Semi&#8208;autonomous cells rely on the external addition of a precursor, which is enzymatically converted in vivo to an ncAA that is directly incorporated. In contrast, autonomous cells have a metabolic system that produces and directly incorporates an ncAA in vivo. Through a critical evaluation of the state of the art, the reader is provided with an opinion on the future development of the field.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG)&#8208;dependent non&#8208;heme iron (NHFe) enzymes constitute a family of enzymes that use 2OG and oxygen to catalyze the hydroxylation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds. These enzymes are of biological importance and therapeutic interest due to their role in regulating various cellular processes. Herein, we have rationally designed two classes of 2OG analogues and have used them as tools to investigate the active site of a 2OG&#8208;dependent NHFe enzyme, prolyl hydroxylase domain 2 (PHD2). Using an activity assay in conjunction with steady&#8208;state kinetics, we identify a new class of aryl&#8208;conjugated 2OG analogues that exhibit 12&#8208;fold varied inhibition and compete with 2OG for the PHD2 active site. Immunoblot studies suggest that these analogues are biologically active and could target PHD2 intracellularly. Furthermore, computational modelling studies reveal that the analogues bind to the active site in a &#8220;flipped&#8221; conformation relative to 2OG, and functional group placement is responsible for their different inhibition capabilities. Our mutagenesis studies further validate this unique binding mode and suggest several interactions that are crucial for inhibition. Overall, these studies provide a toolkit of 2OG analogues to establish structure&#8208;activity relationships and identify interactions that could be useful for PHD2 inhibitor design.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioactivity profiles of progressively ring&#8208;fluorinated cyclohexyl motifs in the WKYMVm peptide as formylpeptide FPR2 agonists and in keto&#8208;piperazines as anti&#8208;trypanosome agents.</title>

         <dc:description>A series of all&#8208;cis ring fluorinated cyclohexylalanines with progressively increasing levels of vicinal fluorines, as well as 4&#8208;fluorophenylalanine and pentafluoroarylphenylalanine were introduced into the WKYMVm peptide in place of its tyrosine residue, for assays against the G&#8208;protein coupled formylpeptide receptor, FPR2. Selected all&#8208;cis ring cyclohexylalanines of this class were also incorporated into a keto&#8208;piperazine molecular scaffold to generate sp3 rich derivatives for assays against the parasite Trypanosoma. brucei. For these cyclohexylalanine analogues bioactivity trends correlated progressively with the levels of fluorination in each of the case studies. Notably, the all&#8208;cis pentafluorocyclohexylalanine analogue of the W&#8208;peptide was least active perhaps correlating with the well&#8208;known polarity of this &#8216;Janus face&#8217; cyclohexane. Although the trend was also apparent in the anti&#8208;trypanosomal assays of the keto&#8208;piperazine derivatives, it was less so and some compounds were more active than the previously reported phenylalanine derived analogue.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Oxidase for Regeneration of Oxidized Non&#8208;natural Cofactor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nicotinamide cytosine dinucleotide (NCD+) is a non&#8208;natural cofactor used for bio&#8208;orthogonal redox biochemistry. In order to regenerate NCD+ for driving oxidative reactions, this study engineers an H2O&#8208;forming NADH oxidase from Enterococcus faecalis to favor NCDH. This best mutant NADH oxidase (NOX)&#8208;KRGT mutant exhibits 107&#8208;fold higher selectivity for NCDH than EfNOX and can oxidize NCDH to form NCD+ in&#8201;vivo. The traceless and effective tool for regenerating NCD+ shall expand our capacity in developing NCD&#8208;linked redox subsystems.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and its reduced form NADH are universal redox cofactors, and thus manipulating NAD(H) supply often leads to unpredictable outcome because of metabolic crosstalk. To overcome intrinsic limitations associated to natural cofactors, this study previously introduces nicotinamide cytosine dinucleotide (NCD+) as a non&#8208;natural cofactor for redox biochemistry. While several enzymes have been devised to generate NCDH as driving force at the expense of cheap chemicals for reductive metabolic reactions, it remains inaccessible to generate NCD+ for oxidative reactions. In this study, it engineers an H2O&#8208;forming NADH oxidase (EfNOX) from Enterococcus faecalis to favor NCDH. Compared to the wild&#8208;type enzyme, the best mutant NADH oxidase (NOX)&#8208;KRGT oxidizes NCDH with 14&#8208; and 107&#8208;fold higher catalytic efficiency and selectivity, respectively. Docking analysis shows that those mutations acquired a narrower cofactor binding cavity and positively charged environment contributing to the preference toward NCDH. Coupling NOX mutants with NCD&#8208;favoring phosphite dehydrogenase mutant enables Escherichia coli BW14329 to utilize phosphite as sole phosphorus source for growth. This work provides a traceless and effective tool to convert NCDH into NCD+, which should greatly expand our capacity in developing NCD&#8208;linked redox subsystems and further facilitate the implementation of non&#8208;natural cofactors in chemical biology and synthetic biology.

         <title>Engineering Glucagon via Molecular and Formulation Strategies: From Natural Hormone to Effective and Stable Therapeutics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glucagon, a 29&#8208;amino acid pancreatic hormone, plays a central role in glucose homeostasis through activation of the glucagon receptor (GCGR). While clinically essential for hypoglycemia rescue, its broader therapeutic applications face limitations due to challenging biophysical properties including poor solubility, strong aggregation tendency, and chemical instability, which currently require lyophilized formulations. Recent advances in peptide engineering and formulation science have enabled the development of next&#8208;generation glucagon analogs with enhanced stability and ready&#8208;to&#8208;use profiles. Moving beyond its classical role in glucose elevation, glucagon is now recognized as a multifunctional metabolic regulator influencing lipid metabolism, energy expenditure, and cardiorenal function. This expanded understanding has driven the development of innovative GCGR&#8208;targeting therapies including multi&#8208;receptor agonists such as glucagon&#8208;like peptide&#8208;1 receptor (GLP&#8208;1R)/GCGR co&#8208;agonists for metabolic disorders and advanced dual&#8208;hormone delivery systems. This review examines the evolving pharmacology of glucagon by analyzing: (1) structural optimization and formulation strategies to address physicochemical challenges, (2) innovative delivery technologies, and (3) emerging therapeutic applications in metabolic diseases. Through critical assessment of translational challenges, this work bridges molecular insights with clinical innovation in glucagon&#8208;based therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoactivatable Alkyne Tag for Photolabeling Biomolecules in Living Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoactivatable linear alkyne tag is developed by caging the intermediate of the Eschenmoser&#8211;Tanabe reaction to expand photoinduced intracellular molecular imaging to a variety of biomolecules. The photoactivatable tag is modified onto a cholesterol analog and introduced into cells. After light irradiation, the tag is successfully labeled with azide&#8208;functionalized fluorescent dye, achieving photoinduced intracellular molecular imaging.

Light&#8208;induced molecular imaging methods have attracted considerable attention owing to their potential for monitoring changes in the localization of intracellular molecules, which can provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of living systems. In this article, a photoactivatable alkyne tag is developed by modifying an unstable intermediate of the alkyne&#8208;forming reaction with a photodegradable protecting group; the photodegradation triggers the conversion of the intermediate into a linear alkyne in an aqueous solution. The developed photoactivatable alkyne tag is incorporated into a cholesterol analog, introduced into living cells, and exposed to a biocompatible dose of 365&#8201;nm light. Subsequently, the cholesterol analog in light&#8208;irradiated cells is microscopically visualized through alkyne&#8208;specific biotinylation via copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition and biotin&#8208;specific labeling with fluorescence&#8208;labeled streptavidin. The obtained results indicate that the photoactivatable alkyne tag can be photoconverted into alkyne derivatives inside cells and applied to the light&#8208;induced intracellular imaging of biomolecules. This photoactivatable chemical tag can potentially expand the range of applications of light&#8208;induced molecular imaging of various biomolecules.

         <title>Development of Thiol&#8208;Labile &#945;&#8208;Amino Protecting Groups for Efficient Solid&#8208;Phase Peptide Synthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To develop thiol&#8208;labile &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;protecting groups for peptide synthesis, the nitrobenzenesulfenyl scaffold is systematically modified and the effects on chemical stability and thiol&#8208;mediated deprotection kinetics are evaluated. The findings reveal that introducing a C6 substituent and replacing the phenyl group with a pyridine ring significantly influence both stability and thiol susceptibility, offering valuable insights for optimizing protecting group design.

Recently, a thiol&#8208;labile &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;protecting group, 2,4&#8208;dinitro&#8208;6&#8208;phenyl&#8208;benzenesulfenyl (DNPBS), is introduced for solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). DNPBS&#8208;SPPS effectively mitigates major side reactions&#8212;such as aspartimide formation and &#945;&#8208;C racemization&#8212;that commonly occur in conventional Fmoc&#8208;SPPS. However, N&#8208;DNPBS&#8208;protected histidine is unstable during the base&#8208;catalyzed peptide bond coupling, leading to histidine redundant insertion byproducts (Nat. Commun. 2023, 14, 5324). In this study, modifications to the nitrobenzenesulfenyl protecting group are explored and their impact on chemical stability and thiol&#8208;mediated deprotection kinetics are systematically evaluated. It is found that introducing a C6 substituent and replacing the phenyl group with a pyridine ring significantly modulate both stability and thiol susceptibility. Notably, 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinesulfenyl (Npys) outperforms DNPBS in SPPS. N&#8208;Npys&#8208;protected histidine exhibits markedly greater stability than its N&#8208;DNPBS&#8208;protected counterpart, effectively preventing histidine redundant insertion byproducts commonly observed in DNPBS&#8208;SPPS. This study provides valuable insights into optimizing nitrobenzenesulfenyl&#8208;based protecting groups for more efficient SPPS.

     alt="Development of Thiol-Labile &#945;-Amino Protecting Groups for Efficient Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To develop thiol-labile &#945;-amino-protecting groups for peptide synthesis, the nitrobenzenesulfenyl scaffold is systematically modified and the effects on chemical stability and thiol-mediated deprotection kinetics are evaluated. The findings reveal that introducing a C6 substituent and replacing the phenyl group with a pyridine ring significantly influence both stability and thiol susceptibility, offering valuable insights for optimizing protecting group design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, a thiol-labile &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-amino-protecting group, 2,4-dinitro-6-phenyl-benzenesulfenyl (DNPBS), is introduced for solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). DNPBS-SPPS effectively mitigates major side reactions&#8212;such as aspartimide formation and &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-C racemization&#8212;that commonly occur in conventional Fmoc-SPPS. However, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-DNPBS-protected histidine is unstable during the base-catalyzed peptide bond coupling, leading to histidine redundant insertion byproducts (&lt;i&gt;Nat. Commun.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;2023&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;14&lt;/i&gt;, 5324). In this study, modifications to the nitrobenzenesulfenyl protecting group are explored and their impact on chemical stability and thiol-mediated deprotection kinetics are systematically evaluated. It is found that introducing a C6 substituent and replacing the phenyl group with a pyridine ring significantly modulate both stability and thiol susceptibility. Notably, 3-nitro-2-pyridinesulfenyl (Npys) outperforms DNPBS in SPPS. &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Npys-protected histidine exhibits markedly greater stability than its &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-DNPBS-protected counterpart, effectively preventing histidine redundant insertion byproducts commonly observed in DNPBS-SPPS. This study provides valuable insights into optimizing nitrobenzenesulfenyl-based protecting groups for more efficient SPPS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Glycoproteins, Glycolipids, or Both: Why do Glycosyltransferases Recognize Different Acceptors?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycosylation is an important post&#8208;translational modification catalyzed by glycosyltransferases (GTs), which comprise a large group of enzymes with diversified specificity. Most GTs show high specificity toward donor and acceptor molecules, but some can recognize several donor or acceptor molecules and/or create novel glycosidic linkage types. This promiscuity has profound implications for cellular processes, influencing signaling pathways, protein stability and disease progression. GT promiscuity may result from the structural peculiarities of the enzyme and acceptor, modulation by a ligand, oligomerization with other enzymes, or its subcellular localization. In this review, we discuss current insights into GT promiscuity, highlighting its biological significance and potential associations with human diseases. A better understanding of how GTs work will be essential for developing novel therapeutic approaches and obtaining enzymes with improved properties, which are desirable in the emerging field of glycobiotechnology.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding of Hg(I) and Hg(II) Ions to Amyloid&#8208;Beta (A&#946;) Peptide Variants Affect Their Structure and Aggregation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mercury (Hg) exposure is a possible risk factor for Alzheimer&#180;s disease (AD). Some studies reported higher Hg levels in AD patients, but evidence is inconclusive. A mechanism linking Hg exposure to AD neuropathology remains to be found. The hallmark of AD brains is deposits of insoluble amyloid plaques consisting mainly of aggregated amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides.
&#160;
Here, we use transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and biophysical spectroscopy techniques to study in vitro interactions between inorganic Hg and pathologically relevant A&#946;(1&#8208;40) and A&#946;(4&#8208;40) variants and the A&#946;(1&#8208;40)(H6A, H13A, H14A) mutant. For the first time, effect on A&#946; aggregation of both Hg(I) and Hg(II) is compared.
&#160;
Hg(II) binds A&#946;(1&#8208;40) with apparent binding affinity of 28&#177;8 &#181;M, at 20 &#176;C in 20 mM MES buffer, pH 7.3. The N&#8208;terminal His6, His13 and His14 residues are involved in binding coordination. Hg(II) binding induces structural alterations (coil&#8208;coil interactions) in A&#946; monomers positioned in membrane&#8208;mimicking SDS micelles. Equimolar amounts of either Hg(I) or Hg(II) inhibit normal A&#946; fibrillation by directing aggregation towards formation of large amorphous aggregates. All these structural rearrangements may be relevant for the harmful A&#946; aggregation processes involved in AD brain pathology. Inducing protein misfolding and aggregation might be a general toxic mechanism of mercury.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization of the Cubamyces Menziesii Terpenome</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The genome of Cubamyces menziesii reveals 18 putative sesquiterpene cyclase genes. These genes are cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, yielding 10 active enzymes. Using farnesyl diphosphate as substrate, the enzymes are analyzed, and the products characterized after bioconversion, uncovering diverse sesquiterpene structures. This study highlights the phylogenetic prediction and the ecological and biotechnological relevance of C. menziesii sesquiterpenes.

Long&#8208;lasting polypore fungi are significant producers of terpene cyclases of high interest for medicinal or biotechnological applications. Following the 1000 Fungal Genomes initiative launched by the Joint Genome Institute, the genome of Cubamyces (C.) menziesii and identified 18 genes encoding sesquiterpene cyclases (STCs) is explored. In a search for robust catalysts suitable for practical applications, the 18 codon&#8208;optimized open reading frames are cloned and overproduced the C. menziesii STCs in Escherichia coli. In ten cases, the catalytically active enzyme is purified and tested with three chemically synthesized linear diphosphates: geranyl diphosphate, farnesyl diphosphate (FDP), and geranylgeranyl diphosphate. Only FDP proved to be a substrate for these 10 enzymes. The product specificity of all these enzymes is determined by (GC&#8208;MS) gas chromatography mass spectrometry and (NMR) nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. Among the 10 enzymes, four produced a predominant compound, four yielded two main compounds, and the remaining two acted as a multiproduct catalysts. This work sheds light on the potential sesquiterpenes involved in the chemical ecology of the polypore C. menziesii and provides evidence for the potential of Polyporales fungi in the identification of new sesquiterpene cyclase activities.
