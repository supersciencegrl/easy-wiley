         <title>A ligase&#8208;based two&#8208;step approach for the generation of bicyclic peptides containing a benzylphenyl thioether framework</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study describes a ligase&#8208;based two&#8208;step strategy to prepare a unique type of bicyclic peptide molecules containing a benzyl phenyl thioether arm. Different from the conventional bicyclic peptide construction method, we first utilized peptide ligases (SrtA or OaAEP1) to introduce an arylthiol group into the parent peptides, and then performed bicyclization of the peptides by using tris&#8208;(bromomethyl)benzene to generate the desired bicyclic peptides. Since the pKa of aryl thiols is lower than that of alkyl thiols, the bicyclization reaction of the peptides in our system can occur under low concentrations of tris&#8208;(bromomethyl)benzene or low pH conditions. The low concentrations of tris&#8208;(bromomethyl)benzene have little effect on the phage infectivity, which will help maintain the diversity of phage&#8208;displayed cyclic peptides. This study established a biocompatible ligase&#8208;mediated two&#8208;step strategy for the preparation of bicyclic peptides, which has potential applications in the discovery of bioactive cyclic peptide ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Constraint For Prevention of Aging of Organophosphate&#8208;Inhibited Acetylcholinesterase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The covalent inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by organophosphate compounds (OPCs) prevents the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, and results in overstimulation of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors leading to severe cholinergic crisis. To treat toxic exposure to OPCs, the focus has been on using reactivator compounds (e.g., oximes) to reverse the adduct formation in the enzyme&#8217;s active site, and to release the regenerated, active form of AChE. However, the interaction between the OPC inhibitor and the enzyme is usually followed by a secondary dealkylative reaction in which the OPC &#8220;ages&#8221;, i.e., produces an oxyanion on the phosphoryl group that cannot be recovered with standard reactivators. Unexpectedly, we discovered that immobilization of AChE prevented aging of OPC adducts. This result led us to hypothesize that the inhibition and recovery pathways in AChE could be regulated by allosteric effectors that bind to the enzyme at a distance away from the site of inhibition. To demonstrate this, we have replicated resistance to aging using bifunctional crosslinking of AChE in solution. This work provides the foundation to expand these principles to other potential effectors.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Cholane&#8211;Phenanthrene&#8211;Cholane Trimers for Light&#8208;Harvesting Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of phosphodiester&#8208;linked cholane&#8211;phenanthrene&#8211;cholane trimers is described. The morphology of the formed nanostructures depends on the phenanthrene isomer used and on the cooling rate during the assembly process leading to nanosheets, worm&#8208;like structures, or nanotubes. Doping with pyrene results in a strong increase in the quantum yield, demonstrating the potential of these assemblies as artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems.

The self&#8208;assembly of two isomeric amphiphilic cholane&#8211;phenanthrene&#8211;cholane trimers and the light&#8208;harvesting properties of the formed supramolecular assemblies in aqueous medium are presented. Distinct differences in the supramolecular nanostructures are observed based on the type of phenanthrene isomer used, as well as on the cooling rate applied during the thermal self&#8208;assembly process. A fast cooling rate results in the formation of 2D objects (nanosheets) with both trimers. In contrast, a slow cooling process results in the observation of 3D objects, with worm&#8208;like nanostructures for the self&#8208;assembled 3,6&#8208;disubstituted phenanthrene trimer and nanotubes for the 2,7&#8208;isomer. Upon doping with an acceptor chromophore, the supramolecular phenanthrene assemblies demonstrate efficient energy transfer. The presence of small quantities (6%) of a pyrene acceptor results in a fivefold increase in the quantum yield compared to the phenanthrene trimer alone, highlighting their potential as artificial light&#8208;harvesting complexes. This work underscores the versatility of amphiphilic phenanthrene derivatives as building blocks for light&#8208;harvesting supramolecular systems.

         <title>First steps towards the design of peptides that influence the intracellular palmitoylation machinery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein S&#8208;palmitoylation is a reversible post&#8208;translational modification transferring the 16&#8208;carbon fatty acid palmitate to cysteines. It plays a critical role in many cellular processes by influencing protein function, localization, stability, and protein&#8208;protein interactions and has a significant impact on various physiological and pathological conditions. This emphasizes the need to develop new technologies to study and treat diseases associated with aberrant palmitoylation. To address these challenges, we present cell&#8208;permeable peptides containing a DHHC palmitoylation motif aiming to affect intracellular protein S&#8208;palmitoylation. A small library of peptides was generated and screened for cellular uptake and cell compatibility. Interestingly, the newly designed peptides internalized to high extent into different cell lines and human breast cell spheroids dependent on their palmitoylation motif. In addition, out of this screen we identified DC&#8208;2 as very potent and investigated this peptide in more detail concerning its impact on palmitoylated proteins that are connected to cancer progression. These initial explorations highlighted that DC&#8208;2 affected the localization of HRas and altered S&#8208;palmitoylation&#8208;related signaling cascades of EGFR. Our findings suggest a peptide&#8208;driven impact on proteins having palmitoylation sites and highlight cell&#8208;permeable DHHC&#8208;peptides as a potential tool to be further evolved in the context of palmitoylation and cancer.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient synthesis of cleavable CPP&#8208;cargo conjugate via low&#8208;equivalent of CPP activated by 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dithiodipyridine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) are favored for protein delivery due to their efficiency, rapidity, and low toxicity. However, conjugation of CPPs to proteins often requires significant amounts of CPPs to ensure yields, which also may result in increased proteins dimer formation. Here, we report that the use of low equivalents 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dithiodipyridine (DPDS)&#8208;activated CPP for conjugation cargo allows for high&#8208;conversion&#8208;rate CPP&#8208;cargo conjugates.

Furthermore, we successfully conjugate three CPPs to cargo via DPDS and confirmed its successful cytosolic delivery through fluorescence imaging.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are favored for protein delivery due to their efficiency, rapidity, and low toxicity. However, conjugation of CPPs to proteins often requires significant amounts of CPPs to ensure yields, which also may result in increased proteins dimer formation. Here, we report that the use of low equivalents 2,2&#8217;-dithiodipyridine (DPDS)-activated CPP for conjugation cargo allows for high-conversion-rate CPP-cargo conjugates. Using this strategy, we obtained high-conversion-rate conjugates of cyclic deca-arginine peptide (cR10) with ubiquitin (Ub) and UbcH7 using only low equivalents of cR10.

         <title>An Indole Dearomatization Strategy for the Synthesis of Pseudo&#8208;Natural Products</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The indole moiety is a privileged fragment that frequently populates existing bioactive compound collections. We describe the development of an indole&#8208;dearomatization sequence and its application for library expansion of a collection of indole&#8208;containing pseudo&#8208;NPs. The resulting compounds are topologically distinct from the original compound class. Phenotyping by means of the cell painting assay initially indicated that the dearomatized compounds are morphologically different than the original pseudo&#8208;NP compound class and guiding NPs. However, analysis by means of a new sub&#8208;profile analysis of the same cell painting assay data indicated that similar morphologies persisted throughout the compound classes. Further biological studies supported the findings of the sub&#8208;profile analysis and highlights its potential to more effectively characterize novel compounds. The biological findings suggest that a plethora of indole&#8208;dearomatization reactions could be applied to existing indole&#8208;containing compound collections to rapidly access new biologically relevant scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Biochemical Characterization of Multimodular Xylanolytic Carbohydrate Esterases from the Marine Bacterium Flavimarina sp. Hel_I_48</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multimodular carbohydrate&#8208;active enzymes often combine different catalytic activities for efficient polysaccharide degradation. In this work, the structural and functional characterization of three multimodular xylan&#8208;targeting esterases, Fl6, Fll1 and Fll4 from Flavimarina sp. Hel_I_48, are presented. Each protein shows novelty in its architecture, with particular emphasis on the enzyme Fll4, which consists of three esterase domains, resulting in bifunctional esterase activity.

Carbohydrate&#8208;active enzymes (CAZymes) are critical for sustainable biomass utilization due to their ability to degrade complex polysaccharides. Frequently, a multimodularity can be observed combining several CAZyme domains and activities in close proximity which can benefit this degradation process. In this study, three multimodular xylanolytic carbohydrate esterases (CEs), named Fl6, Fll1, and Fll4, originating from Flavimarina sp. Hel_I_48 that represent a novel arrangement of catalytic and/or binding domains, are investigated. While Fl6 acts as a glucuronyl esterase, it also contains a carbohydrate binding module which is normally associated with xylanase activity. Fll1 combines xylosidase with acetylxylan esterase (AXE) activity mediated by a CE3 domain. The third enzyme, Fll4, is the first enzyme that comprises three distinct CE domains and shows bifunctional activity as an AXE and a feruloyl esterase (FAE). Investigation of the single domains reveals that the CE6 domain of Fll4 mediates its AXE activity while one of the putative CE1 domains, CE1a, mediates the FAE activity. This investigation of multimodularity of marine CAZymes not only enhances our understanding of these enzymes but may provide a promising route toward more efficient algal biomass utilization for biotechnological applications.

         <title>Dynamic G&#8208;Quadruplexes in the Rous Sarcoma Virus Genome: Scaffolds for Protein Interaction and Potential Anti&#8208;Viral Targets</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(A) The RSV&#8208;DNA contains three G4 elements characterised by CD&#8208;spectroscopy. (B) The CD data was analysed by PCA and SVD to identify the structural forms of these G4s. (C) These G4s are potential anti&#8208;viral targets as G4&#8208;specific small&#8208;molecule ligands recognise them. (D) Further, the importance of these G4s in the viral life cycle is established by their interaction with the host&#8208;protein nucleolin.







Abstract
Summarising the study, RSV is an important pathogen that causes oncogenic transformation in its host via the action of a protein kinase that it expresses. The RSV genome is reverse&#8208;transcribed into its complementary DNA, which then integrates into the host genome. This DNA thereafter serves as a template for transcription to manufacture viral proteins. The viral life cycle can, therefore, be inhibited if the functional elements of this DNA are altered. In this aspect, G4s may play an important role due to their involvement in hijacking the host machinery. Interestingly, the RSV&#8208;DNA contains multiple probable G4 forming elements, among which the sequences with the highest G4 forming propensity are located within the GAG and POL genes. Additionally, a sequence within the SRC oncogene also has G4 forming potential. In this study, we verified the G4 formation in these sequences via various biophysical assays. Further, the structural topology of these G4s has also been studied using computational and biophysical methods. We have established that GG4 forms a parallel G4 structure while PG4 and SG4 form highly dynamic G4s, switching between various structural forms. Such molecular switching behaviour may also aid in the functional properties of these G4s in&#8197;vivo. However, further studies are required to elucidate the functional properties of these elements. We have also analysed the binding of these G4s to specific small&#8208;molecule ligands and the structural changes induced by the binding of Braco&#8208;19 on the G4s. Finally, we have observed that the G4 forming sequences in the RSV&#8208;DNA are recognised and bound by human nucleolin, which is highly similar in structure to the chicken nucleolin. This suggests that the G4s in the RSV&#8208;DNA may be implicated in various biological functions. These studies conclude that G4s are formed in the RSV&#8208;DNA at multiple locations, and these G4s show molecular switching properties under physiological conditions. Further, these G4s are also bound by small&#8208;molecule ligands and proteins, which induce structural changes. Thus, these G4s may be targetable sites for the control of RSV infection.

         <title>Thermal Folding of Peptides into Single &#945;&#8208;Helical Turns</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single &#945;&#8208;helical turns (S&#945;HT) are biorelevant peptide structures with potential applications in drug design. We envisioned augmented applications for thermal folding (T&#8208;folding) S&#945;HT, wherein, a dynamic S&#945;HT in equilibrium with non&#8208;helical conformers can be biased to favor S&#945;HT by increasing the temperature. Short peptides cannot fold into native S&#945;HT due to large conformational entropy. Covalent hydrogen bond surrogates (HBS) for the peptide H&#8208;bond have been designed to counter the entropy and enable such S&#945;HT folds. Here, HBS&#8208;constrained S&#945;HT are synthesized. NMR, CD spectral and computational analyses reveal their existence in a S&#945;HT conformer which is in equilibrium with non&#8208;helical conformers. Temperature&#8208;dependent spectral analyses reveal their T&#8208;folding behaviour, the extent of which can be controlled by varying the number of C&#945;&#8208;substituents at the i+1st and i+2nd residues and solvent polarities. The conformational transition of the minor non&#8208;helical conformers to S&#945;HT with increasing temperature, is at the origin of T&#8208;folding. T&#8208;folding molecules can uniquely serve as therapeutics with thermally augmentable potencies.</dc:description>

         <title>Avoiding Misreading during Genetic Reprogramming in mRNA Display</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
mRNA display is a powerful and increasingly accessible peptide discovery technology, but the in&#8201;vitro translation system it uses to create screening libraries is imperfect. This study examines the prevalence of errors during in&#8201;vitro translation and provides best practices for avoiding such errors to researchers who are designing mRNA display libraries.

mRNA display is a powerful and increasingly accessible peptide discovery technology. It takes advantage of a reconstituted in&#8201;vitro transcription and translation system to generate highly diverse affinity screening libraries. However, this process relies on the faithful translation of genetically encoded peptides, a conversion that is imperfect. Errors in translational decoding of mRNA can occur, decoupling the produced library from its genetic code. Because mRNA display affinity selections are analyzed with sequencing of the encoding DNA, rather than direct detection of the peptides, misreading silently reduces library diversity and complicates analysis. Herein, the presence of significant translational misreading during the production of mRNA display libraries is confirmed, best practices for genetic reprogramming are developed, and those rules are deployed to minimize the disconnect between genotype and phenotype in peptide affinity selections.

         <title>PSL Chemical Biology Symposia: The Increasing Impact of Chemistry in Life Sciences</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 6th Paris Sciences &amp; Lettres Symposium on Chemical Biology gathered&#160;leading researchers to explore cutting&#8208;edge advancements in the field. Held at the Institut Curie in Paris on February 27&#8211;28, 2025, it showcased the latest innovations in designing molecular tools to probe and manipulate biological systems. Through insightful presentations and discussions, the symposium highlighted emerging trends and directions in this rapidly evolving discipline.

This symposium is the 6th Paris Sciences &amp; Lettres (PSL) Chemical Biology meeting (2015, 2016, 2019, 2023, 2024, 2025) being held at Institut Curie. This initiative originally started in 2013 at Institut de Chimie des Substances Naturelles (ICSN) in Gif&#8208;sur&#8208;Yvette and was mostly focused on organic synthesis. It was then exported at Institut Curie to cover a larger scope, before becoming the official French Chemical Biology meeting. This year, around 200 participants had the opportunity to meet world leaders in chemistry and biology who described their latest innovations and future trends covering topics as diverse as prebiotic chemistry, activity&#8208;based protein profiling, high&#8208;resolution cell imaging, nanotechnologies, bio&#8208;orthogonal chemistry, metal ion signaling, ferroptosis, and biocatalysis.

         <title>Synthesis and Structure of Naphthoyl Thiourea&#8208;Based Binuclear Ruthenium(II) Arene Complexes: Studies on Anticancer Activity and Apoptotic Mechanism</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe the synthesis, characterization and anticancer activity of ruthenium(II) p&#8208;cymene complexes comprising naphthoyl thiourea&#8208;based ligands. The synthesized&#160; ruthenium(II) complexes(1&#8208;3) were fully characterized by elemental analysis and spectral&#160;methods. The structure of complex 2 has been elucidated by employing single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD), which verifies the two bidentate N^O and N^S coordination of the thiourea ligand to two Ru(II) centres. Further, the complexes have been subjected to stability studies to illustrate their aquation behavior in an aqueous medium. All the complexes have been screened for their anticancer efficacy in Breast (MCF&#8208;7), Colon (HT&#8208;29), Liver (HepG2) cancerous cells and non&#8208;cancerous kidney (Hek&#8208;293) cells. Among them, complex 2 with an IC50 concentration of 3.59 &#177; 0.72 &#181;M exhibits the most potent activity in HT&#8208;29 cells, surpassing the positive control, cisplatin. &#160;In addition, AO&#8208;EB and Hoechst labelling of all the complexes(1&#8208;3) on HT&#8208;29 cells reveals morphological alterations such as nuclear fragmentation and chromatin condensation resulting from the death of cancerous cells via apoptosis. Biochemical assays such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and flow cytometry strongly confirm the cell death via mitochondrial dysfunction&#8208;mediated apoptosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering and Structural Elucidation of a Sac7d&#8208;Derived IgG Fc&#8208;Specific Affitin and Its Application for the Light&#8208;Controlled Affinity Purification of Antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An affitin derived from the Sac7d scaffold enables the light&#8208;controlled affinity purification of antibodies under physiological conditions, thus overcoming limitations of protein A chromatography. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and affinity measurements reveal complex formation with Fc at the CH2/CH3 junction, similar to protein A/G and FnRn. Combined with the light&#8208;responsive Azo&#8208;tag, this tiny adapter molecule opens new applications in antibody research.

While protein A affinity chromatography is widely established for antibody purification, the acidic elution conditions often lead to protein aggregation and deamidation. Here, an alternative approach is described for the purification of antibodies utilizing an engineered binding protein based on the archaebacterial Sac7d scaffold in combination with light&#8208;controlled &#945;&#8208;CD affinity chromatography (Excitography). Starting from a published affitin molecule, a monomeric protein version (C3A24) was engineered by substituting the unpaired thiol side chain Cys24 within the binding site by Ala, and, unexpectedly, its binding activity towards the human IgG1 Fc region was even improved (KD&#8201;=&#8201;76&#8201;nM). X&#8208;ray analysis of the cocrystallized C3A24 with a recombinant human Fc fragment revealed a 2:1 stoichiometry, with a binding site at the junction between the CH2 and CH3 domains. Interestingly, this binding site coincides with the ones of protein A, protein G, and the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). The affitin/Fc interaction is dominated by a network of hydrogen bonds, whereas, unpredicted by the initial affitin design, the two C&#8208;terminal Lys residues are also involved via a salt bridge and another hydrogen bond. Using the Azo&#8208;tagged C3A24, we purified clinically relevant antibodies from cell culture medium in a single step under physiological buffer conditions.

         <title>Mining Thermophile Genomes for New PETases with Exceptional Thermostabilities Using Sequence Similarity Networks</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeted genome mining identified thermostable enzymes (PETases) that hydrolyze the commonly used plastic polymer polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Thermostable enzymes are identified from thermophilic microbial sources. Experimental results reveal enzymatic activity on authentic PET films, highlighting potential for industrial application. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of one PETase is solved to understand its exceptional thermostability. These findings pave the way for engineering catalysts for a circular PET economy.

Enzymatic hydrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a promising technology for advancing a circular PET economy. Several PET&#8208;degrading &#945;/&#946; hydrolases have been identified, but the full potential of this enzyme family to catalyze PET hydrolysis remains largely unexplored. To address this, sequence similarity networks are employed to investigate the &#945;/&#946; hydrolase fold&#8208;5 subfamily (IPR029059) for new PETases. Priority is given to sequences from thermophiles, as thermostable enzymes are likely more suitable for industrial applications. Ten enzymes with &#8776;20% sequence identity to the well&#8208;known LCC&#8208;PETase are identified, and seven are successfully overexpressed and purified for in vitro characterization. Each enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of p&#8208;nitrophenyl butyrate, a mimic of trimeric PET, and emulsified PET nanoparticles. Notably, three enzymes are also capable of hydrolyzing PET films. Novel PETases exhibit melting temperatures (Tm) exceeding 55&#8201;&#176;C and only modest losses of activity after incubation at 70&#8201;&#176;C for 24&#8201;h. The crystal structure of AroC (Tm&#8201;=&#8201;85&#8201;&#176;C) is resolved to 2.2&#8201;&#197;, revealing several salt bridges that likely confer thermostability, and a unique loop that is conserved among the PETases described here. These novel enzymes will enable engineering campaigns to generate thermostable and catalytically efficient PETases for use as industrial biocatalysts.

         <title>Lienhwalides: Unique Tropolone&#8211;Maleidride Hybrids from Hypoxylon lienhwacheense</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lienhwalides are novel tropolone&#8211;maleidride hybrid molecules unique in nature. Absolute configuration is solved by semisynthetic approaches and X&#8208;ray analysis. Interplay between both lwt and lwm biosynthetic gene clusters is responsible for the production of lienhwalides.

Hypoxylon lienhwacheense, a fungal species with an unclear taxonomic placement within the Hypoxylaceae, presents a highly rare stromatal secondary metabolite profile. Isolation of its major stromatal constituents leads to the discovery of a novel tropolone&#8211;maleidride hybrid molecule, lienhwalide A 5, in addition to the known cordyanhydride B 6, its new derivative 7, and binaphthalenetetraol 8. Unexpectedly, Hypoxylon lienhwacheense produces in liquid cultures various lienhwalide A congeners 9&#8211;11. Their structures and relative configurations are elucidated using high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry&#160;and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, with their absolute configurations determined using X&#8208;ray analysis of a semisynthetic brominated derivative of 9 and synthesizing &#945;&#8208;methoxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylphenylacetyl&#160;esters of 11. Feeding experiments with 13C&#8208;labeled precursors (13C&#8208;methionine; 1&#8208;13C&#8208; and U&#8208;13C6&#8208;glucose) reveal insights into the biogenesis of tropolone and maleidride moieties, according to 13C couplings and incredible natural abundance double quantum transfer NMR data. Genome analysis identifies two separate biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for these moieties, and heterologous expression experiments provide further insights into the interplay of both clusters during the biosynthesis of these hybrid natural products. Remarkably, lienhwalides exhibit reduced toxicity and enhance antibacterial selectivity compared to related fungal tropolones.

&lt;p&gt;Lienhwalides are novel tropolone&#8211;maleidride hybrid molecules unique in nature. Absolute configuration is solved by semisynthetic approaches and X-ray analysis. Interplay between both &lt;i&gt;lwt&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;lwm&lt;/i&gt; biosynthetic gene clusters is responsible for the production of lienhwalides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hypoxylon lienhwacheense&lt;/i&gt;, a fungal species with an unclear taxonomic placement within the Hypoxylaceae, presents a highly rare stromatal secondary metabolite profile. Isolation of its major stromatal constituents leads to the discovery of a novel tropolone&#8211;maleidride hybrid molecule, lienhwalide A &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;, in addition to the known cordyanhydride B &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;, its new derivative &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;, and binaphthalenetetraol &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;. Unexpectedly, &lt;i&gt;Hypoxylon lienhwacheense&lt;/i&gt; produces in liquid cultures various lienhwalide A congeners &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;11&lt;/b&gt;. Their structures and relative configurations are elucidated using high-resolution mass spectrometry&#160;and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, with their absolute configurations determined using X-ray analysis of a semisynthetic brominated derivative of &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt; and synthesizing &#945;-methoxy-&#945;-trifluoromethylphenylacetyl&#160;esters of &lt;b&gt;11&lt;/b&gt;. Feeding experiments with &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-labeled precursors (&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-methionine; 1-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C- and U-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-glucose) reveal insights into the biogenesis of tropolone and maleidride moieties, according to &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C couplings and incredible natural abundance double quantum transfer NMR data. Genome analysis identifies two separate biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for these moieties, and heterologous expression experiments provide further insights into the interplay of both clusters during the biosynthesis of these hybrid natural products. Remarkably, lienhwalides exhibit reduced toxicity and enhance antibacterial selectivity compared to related fungal tropolones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Artificial Lipidation of Antifungal Proteins and Antifungal Behavior: A Case Study with Cholesterylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The antifungal behavior of artificial palmitoylated or cholesterylated chitinase domain is studied from biological, chemical, and physical properties, highlighting the importance of the chemical properties of the lipid moiety covalently attached to chitinase domain to obtain effective antifungal activity by artificial protein lipidation through a microbial transglutaminase&#8208;mediated reaction.

Lipid&#8208;based formulation of antifungal small drugs is used to mitigate drug toxicity while retaining effective antifungal activity. Herein, the effect of artificial cholesterylation of is studied, both of which were site&#8208;specifically modified using a microbial transglutaminase&#8208;reactive Q&#8208;tag (LysM&#8208;Q and CatD&#8208;Q). This produced protein&#8211;lipid conjugates (LysM&#8208;cholesteryl [Chol] or &#8208;palmitoyl [Pal] and CatD&#8208;Chol or &#8208;Pal). Although lipidation of these chitinase domains enhances the antifungal activity against Trichoderma viride, palmitoylated proteins (LysM&#8208;Pal and CatD&#8208;Pal) show stronger antifungal effects than cholesterylated proteins (LysM&#8208;Chol and CatD&#8208;Chol) both in the absence and presence of amphotericin B. Further characterization with lipidated LysM&#8208;fused green fluorescent protein (LysM&#8208;muGFP&#8208;Pal and &#8208;Chol) shows that the cholesterylation of proteins promotes distribution to dextran&#8208;rich phase in an aqueous two&#8208;phase system consisting of polyethylene glycol and dextran. Fluorescence microscopic analyses of the phase&#8208;separated giant unilamellar vesicles reveal a distinct anchoring behavior between LysM&#8208;muGFP&#8208;Pal and &#8208;Chol to lipid membranes, which is possibly correlated with aggregate formation. These results highlight that the chemical properties of the lipid moiety are crucial to achieve effective enhancement of antifungal activity through artificial lipidation.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Gapmer Oligonucleotides Containing 4&#8242;&#8208;Carboxy&#8208; and 4&#8242;&#8208;Carbamoyl&#8208;Thymidine Analogs</title>

Gapmer oligonucleotides (ONs) containing 4&#8242;&#8208;carboxy&#8208; and 4&#8242;&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;thymidine analogs in the gap region are synthesized and evaluated. Derivatization of the ONs is performed via postsynthetic modification. The synthesized ONs can form a stable duplex with target RNA regardless of 4&#8242;&#8208;substuents and elicit RNase H&#8208;mediated degradation of the RNA, and the RNA degradation rate is depending on the type of 4&#8242;&#8208;substuents.

Gapmer oligonucleotides (ONs) contain a gap region consisting of DNA, whose heteroduplex with RNA can be a substrate for RNase H. Herein, the synthesis and properties of gapmer ONs containing 4&#8242;&#8208;carboxy&#8208; and 4&#8242;&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;thymidine analogs at the gap region are reported. Synthesis of the ONs was performed by postsynthetic modification of 4&#8242;&#8208;(methoxycarbonyl)thymidine through hydrolysis and nucleophilic substitution. Concerning the synthesis of ONs containing 4&#8242;&#8208;(propylcarbamoyl)thymidine, postsynthetic conversion of 4&#8242;&#8208;carboxythymidine or 4&#8242;&#8208;(phenoxycarbonyl)thymidine on the support is effective. The duplex stabilities of the modified ONs are comparable to those of the unmodified ON. Several types of modified ONs can elicit the RNase H&#8208;mediated degradation of target RNA. Furthermore, modified ON containing 4&#8242;&#8208;carboxy&#8208;thymidine at the gap region shows improved stability in fetal bovine serum solution. The analogs used in this study can be modified nucleosides for the gap region of gapmer ONs.

         <title>Interdomain Coordination Determines Polyketide Extender Unit Specificity in UK&#8208;2A Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current understanding suggests that the specificity of extender unit incorporation is primarily regulated by acyltransferase domain, along with ketosynthase and thioesterase domains, In this work, it shows that the specificity extender unit incorporation is governed by interdomain coordination across the entire polyketide synthase module, rather than individual domains, offering new insights for the future engineering of polyketides.

Controlling the incorporation of extender units is a key strategy for manipulating polyketide scaffolds. Current understanding suggests that extender unit incorporation by modular polyketide synthase (PKS) is primarily regulated by acyltransferase domains, along with ketosynthase, ketoreductase, and thioesterase domains. In this study, the mechanism is investigated underlying the specific incorporation of the benzyl side chain at the C7 position of UK&#8208;2A, both in&#8201;vivo and in&#8201;vitro. These findings reveal that the incorporation of the benzylmalonyl&#8208;CoA extender unit is governed by interdomain coordination across the entire PKS module, rather than being controlled by individual domains. These results challenge previous recognition and offer new insights for the future engineering of polyketides.

         <title>Bromine&#8208;substituted tricyanofuran&#8208;based fluorogenic probes for the sensitive detection of glycosidases under acidic pH</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycosidases participate in modulating a number of biological processes, and their overexpression is a hallmark of several human diseases. Considering the localization of glycosidases predominantly in the lysosomes, it is imperative to develop molecular probes that are resistant to interference from acidic pH. Here, we synthesized tricyanofuran (TCF)&#8208;based long&#8208;wavelength fluorogenic probes, and demonstrated that the introduction of bromine to the ortho&#8208;position of the phenol alcohol of the probe substantially enhanced its fluorescence over an acidic pH range of 3.0&#8208;10.0. These probes, when modified with glycosyl substrates, have proved applicable for the sensitive fluorogenic detection of glycosidases under acidic pH, and fluorescence&#8208;based imaging of endogenous &#946;&#8208;galactosidase and &#946;&#8208;glucosidase activities in live cells. The imaging results are validated by quantitative real&#8208;time polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting.</dc:description>

         <title>The Persistent Myth of Limonene's Smell</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural monoterpenes stir our sense of smell in a special way. The scent of the monoterpene limonene, a major component of citrus oils, is thoroughly investigated. Still, the information on its smell is confusing. In this Perspective article, the smell of citrus oils and its odorant components are discussed, focusing especially on the two enantiomers of limonene.

The scent of the well&#8208;known monoterpene limonene is thoroughly investigated. Despite this, the scientific community does not reach consensus. In this Perspective article, a discussion is contributed by giving a simple overview of the olfactory system, as well as presenting the smell of well&#8208;known compounds and their odor threshold values in citrus oils, from which (R)&#8208;limonene is extracted. In particular, the composition of oils from orange and lemon peel and their association with the (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;enantiomers of limonene, respectively, are considered. Then, the controversy surrounding the odors of (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;limonene and the myth that has been spun from this are reported, particularly in the organic chemistry literature, before an argument for why this myth should be dismantled. Based on the chemical and physiological processes involved in the sense of smell, whether the odor attributed to a certain compound is from that compound and/or from derivatives produced by enzymes associated with the olfactory system is also briefly discussed.

In this Perspective article, the smell of citrus oils and its odorant components are discussed, focusing especially on the two enantiomers of limonene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scent of the well-known monoterpene limonene is thoroughly investigated. Despite this, the scientific community does not reach consensus. In this Perspective article, a discussion is contributed by giving a simple overview of the olfactory system, as well as presenting the smell of well-known compounds and their odor threshold values in citrus oils, from which (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-limonene is extracted. In particular, the composition of oils from orange and lemon peel and their association with the (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)- and (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-enantiomers of limonene, respectively, are considered. Then, the controversy surrounding the odors of (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)- and (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-limonene and the myth that has been spun from this are reported, particularly in the organic chemistry literature, before an argument for why this myth should be dismantled. Based on the chemical and physiological processes involved in the sense of smell, whether the odor attributed to a certain compound is from that compound and/or from derivatives produced by enzymes associated with the olfactory system is also briefly discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Molecular Toolbox for Linkage Type&#8208;Specific Analysis of Ubiquitin Signaling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modification of proteins and other biomolecules with ubiquitin regulates virtually all aspects of eukaryotic cell biology. Ubiquitin can be attached to substrates as a monomer or as an array of polyubiquitin chains with defined linkages between the ubiquitin moieties. Each ubiquitin linkage type adopts a distinct structure, enabling the individual linkage types to mediate specific functions or outcomes in the cell. The dynamics, heterogeneity, and in some cases low abundance, makes analysis of linkage type&#8208;specific ubiquitin signaling a challenging and complex task. Here we review the strategies and molecular tools available for enrichment, detection, and characterization of linkage type&#8208;specific ubiquitin signaling. The molecular &#8216;toolbox&#8217; consists of a range of molecularly different affinity reagents, including antibodies and antibody&#8208;like molecules, affimers, engineered ubiquitin&#8208;binding domains, catalytically inactive deubiquitinases, and macrocyclic peptides, each with their unique characteristics and binding modes. The molecular engineering of these ubiquitin&#8208;binding molecues makes them useful tools and reagents that can be coupled to a range of analytical methods, such as immunoblotting, fluorescence microscopy, mass spectrometry&#8208;based proteomics, or enzymatic analyses to aid in deciphering the ever&#8208;expanding complexity of ubiquitin modifications.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibition of surfactin biosynthesis in&#160;Bacillus subtilis&#160;using cell&#8208;permeable adenylation domain inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several natural bacterial virulence factors are biosynthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Therefore, NRPSs producing such natural products have emerged as attractive antibiotic targets. We have previously reported&#160;N&#8208;(aminoacyl)sulfamoyladenosine (aminoacyl&#8208;AMS) derivatives with chemical modifications at 2&#8242;&#8208;OH&#160;group of the adenosine skeleton that inhibit NRPS amino acid adenylation (A) domains in recombinant enzyme systems, cellular lysates, and bacterial cells. The introduction of a couple of functionalities at the&#160;2&#8242;&#8208;OH&#160;group preserve the binding affinity toward NRPS amino acid A&#8208;domains and improve cell permeability of the AMS scaffold. However, the effects of these compounds on secondary metabolism have not yet been explored. In this study, we validated an affinity&#8208;based protein profiling (AfBPP) probe, Leu&#8208;AMS&#8208;BPyne, for in&#8208;cell applications, including imaging of NRPS activities in bacteria. Next, we synthesized&#160;L&#8208;Leu&#8208;AMS derivatives incorporating methyl, benzyl, and cyanomethyl functionalities at the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group and investigated inhibitory activity toward intracellular surfactin&#8208;NRPSs in the surfactin&#8208;producer&#160;Bacillus subtilisATCC 21332 using the AfBPP probe.&#160;Finally, we demonstrated the attenuation of surfactin production using a Leu&#8208;AMS&#8208;BPyne probe and&#160;L&#8208;Leu&#8208;AMS derivatives in&#160;B. subtilis. These results indicate that chemical modifications&#160;at the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group&#160;provide a way to develop cell&#8208;permeable and functional NRPS A&#8208;domain inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Total Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Galacto&#8208;Oligosaccharides Using Boron&#8208;Mediated Aglycon Delivery and Evaluation of Their Immune&#8208;Enhancing Activities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Galacto&#8208;oligosaccharides (&#945;&#8208;GOSs) are natural oligomeric saccharides found in plants that have garnered significant interest due to their indigestible nature and various biological activities. However, they often exist as inseparable mixtures, particularly long&#8208;chain substances.&#160;This study successfully achieved the total synthesis of &#945;&#8208;GOSs 1&#8208;6, featuring different lengths of galactose chains, using the boron&#8208;mediated aglycon delivery (BMAD) method developed in our laboratory. Additionally, we investigated the immune&#8208;enhancing activity and structure&#8208;activity relationships (SAR) of the chemically synthesized &#945;&#8208;GOSs. It was revealed that the length of the galactose chain in the &#945;&#8208;GOSs significantly influences their immune&#8208;enhancing properties. Specifically, &#945;&#8208;GOS 2, which contains two galactose units, was found to markedly promote macrophage phagocytosis and increase the production of cytokines such as IL&#8208;6, TNF&#8208;&#945;, and IL&#8208;1&#946;. These results suggest that &#945;&#8208;GOS 2 could serve as a natural immunomodulatory agent in functional foods.</dc:description>

         <title>A Diazaborine Activity&#8208;Based Sensing Fluorescent Probe Reports Endogenously Produced Mitochondrial Peroxynitrite in Live Macrophages</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first diazaborine activity&#8208;based sensing probe for selective imaging of endogenously produced peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8208;) is presented. Peroxynitrite Probe&#8208;1 (PNP&#8208;1) selectivity is enabled with a novel pendant&#8208;tuning strategy to specify detection of ONOO&#8208; over other oxidative metabolites, including over H2O2 and HOCl, which interfere with other organoboron&#8208;based probes. Notably, PNP&#8208;1 preferentially localizes to mitochondria, enabling the detection of endogenous mitochondrial peroxynitrite.







Abstract
We present the synthesis, properties, and imaging applications of a new class of diazaborine&#8208;based probes (Peroxynitrite Probe&#8208;1, PNP&#8208;1) for selective peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;) imaging in live cells. PNP&#8208;1 features a diazaborine&#8208;based reaction motif that provides excellent discrimination between H2O2 and ONOO&#8722;, solving a persistent challenge of organoboron&#8208;based fluorescent probes for oxidative metabolite imaging. We demonstrate the utility of PNP&#8208;1 to detect endogenously produced ONOO&#8722; in live RAW 264.7 macrophages by fluorescence microscopy, with probe selectivity confirmed with inhibition of NADPH oxidases and nitric oxide synthase, the requisite enzymatic machinery for ONOO&#8722; production. Co&#8208;localization studies unexpectedly reveal preferential mitochondrial localization, which we show is dependent on the naphthalimide scaffold. Taken together, our results show that diazaborines are a novel motif for selective ONOO&#8722; reactivity, positioning them for incorporation into other ONOO&#8722;&#8208;specific chemical biology tools.

Directed Evolution of Fluorescent Genetically Encoded Biosensors: Innovative Approaches for Development and Optimization of Biosensors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directed evolution significantly facilitates development of genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors, enabling the development of brighter and more specific biosensors. Novel methods enhance screening processes, decrease resources and costs, and integrate machine learning for optimized outcomes. Promising directions include near&#8208;infrared and photochromic biosensors, alongside de&#8201;novo design of sensing domains.

Fluorescent protein&#8208;based biosensors are indispensable molecular tools in cell biology and biomedical research, providing non&#8208;invasive dynamic measurements of metabolite concentrations and other cellular signals. Traditional methods for developing these biosensors rely on rational design, but directed evolution methods offer a more efficient alternative. This review discusses recent advancements in the development of biosensors using directed evolution, including methods for optimizing domain fusions, sequence optimization, and new screening and selection systems. Additionally, the incorporation of machine learning into the directed evolution process is explored, highlighting its potential to enhance the efficiency and cost reduction of biosensor development. Finally, emerging trends in the development of near&#8208;infrared biosensors and photochromic sensors are discussed, along with the opportunities presented by de&#8201;novo design of sensing domains and biosensors.

Cationic Polymers for Gene Delivery: Properties and Functional Optimization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, three types of cationic polymers, the nonbiodegradable polymers polyethyleneimine and polyamidoamine, the biodegradable natural polymers chitosan and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin , and the biodegradable synthetic polymers poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester)s, are reviewed. The modification of these cationic polymers includes four general strategies, which improve the overall performance of gene carriers.

Developing safe and efficient nucleic acid delivery systems has been a major challenge for gene therapy. Cationic polymers, with their easily modifiable chemical structure and high nucleic acid loading capacity, can meet a wide range of needs for gene delivery. Research on using these polymers as gene delivery vectors is rapidly developing. In this paper, cationic polymers are briefly categorized into three types: nonbiodegradable polymers, biodegradable natural polymers, and biodegradable synthetic polymers. Among these three types, several representative delivery carriers are selected to be discussed in detail, which are polyethyleneimine, polyamidoamine, chitosan, &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin, and poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester)s. The physicochemical properties and structure optimization strategies of these representative types of carriers are outlined. The deficiencies and common major modification strategies of these vectors are summarized in comparison, which can provide new ideas for the design and development of cationic polymer gene vectors in the future.

         <title>Peptide Stapling Using Sonogashira Coupling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sonogashira coupling of sidechains has been employed for stapling a series of peptides. The iodide and alkynyl derivatives required for the stapling reaction were introduced at the i and i+4 or i and i+7 positions as 4&#8208;iodophenylalanine and 4&#8208;propargyloxyphenylalanine, respectively. It is shown through CD analysis that a linear peptide showed increased helicity after stapling.







Abstract
An efficient method for the stapling of peptides by linking residues at the i and i+4 or i and i+7 positions through Sonagashira coupling is reported. The alkyne and aryl iodide functionality required are introduced by modifying tyrosine residues to 4&#8208;iodophenylalanine (PhI) and 4&#8208;propargyloxyphenylalanine (TyP) residues. Comparing the conformations of a stapled peptide with the corresponding linear peptide using CD spectroscopy reveals a more helical structure for the stapled peptide.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Reactions for Bioactive Sulfur Species Delivery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review introduces the concept of bioorthogonal reactions triggered bioactive sulfur species delivery and summarizes representative delivery systems developed by this strategy in recent years. This approach offers a promising solution to realize precise and controllable small sulfuric molecule release. These bioorthogonal prodrug strategies also have enhanced benefits, including organelle targeting ability, spatiotemporal fluorescence feedback, and orthogonality with other reactions.

Bioorthogonal chemistry has emerged as a powerful tool for the development of controllable drug delivery systems. Bioactive sulfur species, which participate in complex sulfur signaling pathways, play crucial roles in various physiological and pathological processes. However, achieving precise and controlled administration of these sulfur species remains challenging due to their unique physicochemical properties. Over the past few years, a growing number of delivery strategies, which are triggered by different stimuli, have been developed to enhance our understanding of sulfur signaling. Bioorthogonal triggers not only offer excellent controllability but also provide advantages such as tunability, targeted delivery, and spatiotemporal feedback. This review highlights representative donors that can be activated through bioorthogonal reactions and their applications in studying the biological mechanisms and therapeutic functions of the bioactive sulfur species.

         <title>Target&#8208;Guided Design and Synthesis of Aryl&#8208;Functionalized Promysalin Analogs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, target&#8208;guided analog design was employed to enhance the interactions of promysalin, a species&#8208;specific Pseudomonad inhibitor, with succinate dehydrogenase. We hypothesized that aromatic analogs could target an unexplored region primed for &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions leading to more potent compounds. Here, we report the in&#8208;silico design, scalable route, and biological characterization against a panel of clinically relevant strains.

The development of new narrow&#8208;spectrum antibiotics is a promising approach to combat antibiotic resistance. Promysalin, a secondary metabolite isolated from Pseudomonas putida, exhibits potent species&#8208;specific inhibition of the pathogen P. aeruginosa (IC50 21&#8201;nM). Herein, the total synthesis and stereochemical assignment of promysalin, structure&#8211;activity relationship studies, and the identification of its molecular target, succinate dehydrogenase, are previously reported by the group. These findings enable computational studies of promysalin's interactions with succinate dehydrogenase, revealing a novel binding site region primed for &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions with a nearby tryptophan residue. It is hypothesized that new aromatic analogs of promysalin can target this beneficial interaction, potentially leading to more potent inhibitors of P. aeruginosa growth. Herein, the in silico design of these analogs, a scalable and general synthetic route to access them, and characterization of their activity against a panel of clinically relevant P. aeruginosa strains are reported.

         <title>Degradation of Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Megasynthetases SrfAA and SrfAB by Acyldepsipeptide&#8208;Activated ClpP in Bacillus Subtilis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
FtsZ is the only target protein that has been biochemically confirmed to be hydrolyzed both in&#8201;vitro and in bacterial cells. Coupled with activity&#8208;based protein profiling of nonribosomal peptide synthetases, the ClpP&#8208;ADEP1 proteolytic complex that degrades the surfactin synthetases SrfAA and SrfAB in cell lysates and bacterial cells is demonstrated.

Protein degradation is a tightly controlled biological process and is essential for maintaining bacterial proteostasis. ClpPs are a highly conserved family of serine proteases that interact with ATPases and play key roles in diverse cellular activities, including heat&#8208;shock response, expression of virulence factors, and protein turnover and homeostasis. Owing to their vital roles, drugs targeting ClpP&#8208;ATPases have attracted interest in treating bacterial infections. The mode of action of the antibiotic acyldepsipeptide (ADEP) is uncontrolled proteolysis by an ATPase&#8208;independent ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex. The cell division protein FtsZ is the only bacterial protein confirmed to be hydrolyzed by the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex in recombinant enzyme systems and cells. Here, the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex that causes degradation of the secondary metabolite nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) SrfAA and SrfAB in Bacillus subtilis is reported. Using in&#8201;vivo and in&#8201;vitro studies coupled with activity&#8208;based protein profiling of NRPSs, the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex that degrades SrfAA and SrfAB is demonstrated. Furthermore, the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex is reconstructed in cell lysates, confirming that SrfAA and SrfAB are sensitive to degradation by the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex. These findings demonstrate that SrfAA and SrfAB are protein substrates for the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex, providing novel insights into the ClpP degradation machinery.

         <title>Design of Short Peptides for the Reduction of Silver Ions and Stabilization of Nanocomposites in Combating Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular design of amino acids, amphiphilic peptides, oligopeptides, and cationic antimicrobial peptides is crucial for reducing silver ions and stabilizing nanocomposites. The silver&#8208;peptide nanocomposites can be formed with and without the assistance of ultraviolet/sunlight but without any toxic reagents and plant extracts or microorganism, and they effectively inhibit bacterial strains by disrupting membranes and generating reactive oxygen species.

Combating bacterial infections has become a formidable challenge in healthcare due to the rise of antibiotic resistance.

&lt;p&gt;The molecular design of amino acids, amphiphilic peptides, oligopeptides, and cationic antimicrobial peptides is crucial for reducing silver ions and stabilizing nanocomposites. The silver-peptide nanocomposites can be formed with and without the assistance of ultraviolet/sunlight but without any toxic reagents and plant extracts or microorganism, and they effectively inhibit bacterial strains by disrupting membranes and generating reactive oxygen species.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Direct Preparation of Site&#8208;Specific Antibody&#8211;Drug Conjugates with Unpurified Antibodies in Culture Medium</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A K248 site&#8208;specific conjugation strategy enabling direct preparation of homogeneous antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) from unpurified cell culture media is established in this study. The method can be conducted under mild conditions with rapid completion, eliminating antibody pretreatment. It demonstrates broad compatibility with diverse payloads , , offering a streamlined, scalable solution for both laboratory and industrial ADCs&#160;production.

In comparison with traditional chemotherapeutic drugs, antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) have been extensively employed in cancer therapy due to their high selectivity and low systemic toxicity. However, the structural complexity of ADCs makes its preparation process more intricate and time&#8208;consuming. Conventional ADC production involves multistep purification processes, which significantly increase the costs. Herein, an approach for the direct preparation of site&#8208;specific ADCs in an antibody expression system that is derived from the reported K248 site&#8208;specific modification technology is demonstrated. This strategy requires only a single purification step to obtain site&#8208;specific ADCs, thereby greatly shortening the preparation cycle of ADCs. The preparation of site&#8208;specific ADCs in the expression system of Sacituzumab is successfully achieved. The resulting ADCs exhibited comparable physicochemical properties and activities to those obtained through the conventional two&#8208;step purification strategy. The approach demonstrates high compatibility with various linkers and antibodies, offering a streamlined&#160;methodology for the preparation of site&#8208;specific ADCs.

Indoleamine&#8208;2,3&#8208;dioxygenase&#8208;1 (IDO1) is a critical immunoregulatory enzyme responsible for the metabolism of tryptophan during inflammation and disease. Based on a 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran framework, examples of indoleamine&#8208;2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitors containing a diverse set of boron&#8208;based functional groups (closo&#8208;1,2&#8208; and 1,7&#8208;carborane, boronic acids and esters, and benzoxaboroles) are reported. The novel boron derivatives display low micrometer affinity for the human recombinant enzyme, with IC50 values ranging from 8 to 60&#8201;&#956;M. Superior results are observed for the closo&#8208;carborane compounds which demonstrate a significant improvement in potency over their phenyl analogues, with inhibition of the IDO1 enzyme increasing by up to &#8776;80%.

         <title>Valdiazen Derivatives for Chemoproteomic Studies in Burkholderia cenocepacia H111</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Valdiazen is a&#8201;quorum&#8208;sensing signal isolated from B. c. H111. Using diazeniumdiolate chemical probes, several valdiazen&#8208;binding proteins are identified, many of which are involved in structural and metabolic processes. This study offers valuable chemical tools and advances our understanding of the interactome associated with diazeniumdiolate signaling molecules.

Quorum sensing (QS) allows bacteria to coordinate community&#8208;wide behaviors such as biofilm formation, virulence, and symbiosis. The diazeniumdiolate valdiazen is identified in the opportunistic pathogen Burkholderia cenocepacia H111 as a novel quorum&#8208;sensing signal, yet its protein interactome remains unexplored. In this study, a chemoproteomic pulldown approach is used to identify potential valdiazen&#8208;binding proteins. For these pulldown experiments, a series of alkyne&#8208;linked and biotin&#8208;conjugated valdiazen probes are synthesized. Affinity&#8208;based pulldown experiments using biotin&#8208;valdiazen conjugates successfully identify several putative proteins including an ATP synthase subunit, a succinylglutamate desuccinylase/aspartoacylase, a granule&#8208;associated protein, an acetyl&#8208;CoA hydrolase, a serine protease and an OmpA/MotB precursor. Overall, this study provides insights into the valdiazen&#8211;protein interactome in Burkholderia cenocepacia H111, advancing our understanding of the role of valdiazen in bacterial QS.

         <title>Synthesis and Metal&#8208;Ion Binding Properties of Duplexes Containing Thymine Analogs with 1,2&#8208;Diamine Groups</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The findings of thermal denaturation experiments indicate that duplexes containing thymine analogues with 1,2&#8208;ethylenediamine side chains show stabilizing effects with six metal ions (e.g., Cu(II), Ni(II), Zn(II), Co(II), Cd(II)). The 1,2&#8208;diamine side chain demonstrated to be useful as a new metal&#8208;ion binding site.

Thymidine analogue with a 1,2&#8208;diamino side chain at the 3N position is synthesized and converted into an amidite unit for oligonucleotide synthesis. It is used for preparing oligonucleotides containing a 1,2&#8208;diamino side chain as X residue. Thermal denaturation studies are performed on a duplex containing an X&#8211;X pair in the presence and absence of metal ions. Among various metal ions used in this research, Cd(II), Co(II), Cu(II), Ni(II), and Zn(II) ions increased the duplex stability. The results prove the new strategy to design metallo&#8208;base pairs containing various metal ions.

         <title>A Bacterial Sulfotransferase Catalyzes an Unusual Di&#8208;Sulfation in Natural Products Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a unique sulfotransferase, AdpST, is identified from the adp biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) in Streptomyces davaonensis DSM101723 and demonstrates that AdpST possesses di&#8208;sulfation activity, which is unprecedented for bacterial phosphoadenosine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;phosphosulfate (PAPS)&#8208;dependent sulfotransferases. It is further shown that the adp BGC contains a dedicated PAPS biosynthetic cassette essential for improving sulfation capacity.

Sulfation is a widely used strategy in nature to modify the solubility, polarity, and biological activities of molecules. The enzymes catalyzing sulfation, sulfotransferases (STs), are typically highly specific to a single sulfation site in a molecule. Herein, the identification and characterization of sulfated adipostatins is reported and reveals a novel sulfotransferase, AdpST, which is responsible for di&#8208;sulfation at two sites of adipostatins. The initial bioinformatic analysis in search of adipostatin analogs from Streptomyces davaonensis DSM101723 identifies adpST and a 3&#8217;&#8208;phosphoadenosine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;phosphosulfate (PAPS) biosynthetic cassette, which are co&#8208;clustered with the adipostatin&#8208;encoding type III polyketide synthase. Mono&#8208; and di&#8208;sulfated adipostatin analogs are discovered in the extracts of S. davaonensis DSM101723, whereas di&#8208;sulfated bacterial natural products has not been reported. Using a series of in&#8201;vivo and in&#8201;vitro experiments, it is confirmed that AdpST is solely responsible for both mono&#8208; and di&#8208;sulfation of adipostatins, a catalytic activity which has not been identified in bacterial PAPS&#8208;dependent STs to date. It is further demonstrated that the dedicated PAPS biosynthetic cassette improves di&#8208;sulfation capacity. Lastly, it is determined that AdpST shares similarity with a small group of uncharacterized STs, suggesting the presence of additional unique bacterial STs in nature, and that AdpST is phylogenetically distant from many characterized STs.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, a unique sulfotransferase, AdpST, is identified from the &lt;i&gt;adp&lt;/i&gt; biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) in &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces davaonensis&lt;/i&gt; DSM101723 and demonstrates that AdpST possesses di-sulfation activity, which is unprecedented for bacterial phosphoadenosine-5&#8217;-phosphosulfate (PAPS)-dependent sulfotransferases. It is further shown that the &lt;i&gt;adp&lt;/i&gt; BGC contains a dedicated PAPS biosynthetic cassette essential for improving sulfation capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfation is a widely used strategy in nature to modify the solubility, polarity, and biological activities of molecules. The enzymes catalyzing sulfation, sulfotransferases (STs), are typically highly specific to a single sulfation site in a molecule. Herein, the identification and characterization of sulfated adipostatins is reported and reveals a novel sulfotransferase, AdpST, which is responsible for di-sulfation at two sites of adipostatins. The initial bioinformatic analysis in search of adipostatin analogs from &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces davaonensis&lt;/i&gt; DSM101723 identifies &lt;i&gt;adpST&lt;/i&gt; and a 3&#8217;-phosphoadenosine-5&#8217;-phosphosulfate (PAPS) biosynthetic cassette, which are co-clustered with the adipostatin-encoding type III polyketide synthase. Mono- and di-sulfated adipostatin analogs are discovered in the extracts of &lt;i&gt;S. davaonensis&lt;/i&gt; DSM101723, whereas di-sulfated bacterial natural products has not been reported. Using a series of in&#8201;vivo and in&#8201;vitro experiments, it is confirmed that AdpST is solely responsible for both mono- and di-sulfation of adipostatins, a catalytic activity which has not been identified in bacterial PAPS-dependent STs to date. It is further demonstrated that the dedicated PAPS biosynthetic cassette improves di-sulfation capacity. Lastly, it is determined that AdpST shares similarity with a small group of uncharacterized STs, suggesting the presence of additional unique bacterial STs in nature, and that AdpST is phylogenetically distant from many characterized STs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From Genes to Molecules: The Fusarium PKS16 Gene Cluster Facilitates the Biosynthesis of Proliferapyrones</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The genus Fusarium is notoriously known for infecting important crops worldwide. During infection, fusaria may produce natural products with noxious properties, thereby threatening global food security. Here, we show that the previously cryptic PKS16 biosynthetic gene cluster consists of eight to nine co&#8208;regulated genes, depending on the Fusarium species, which are responsible for the production of proliferapyrone E.







Abstract
Ascomycete fungi of the genus Fusarium are found in manifold ecological niches and thus pursue several lifestyles. On average, individual Fusarium species have the genetic capability to produce 50 natural products (NPs), which are in general thought to improve the fungus&#8216;s fitness in defined environments. This also includes NPs with toxic potential (mycotoxins) contaminating food and feed sources. Recent research has shown that the production of NPs is tightly regulated on the transcriptional level and depends on the delicate balance between the deposition and removal of histone marks. Within this study, we show that the expression of the prior cryptic Fusarium PKS16 biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) greatly depends on modifications at histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27). By combining molecular&#8208;, chemical&#8208;, and bioinformatic analyses we show that the PKS16 BGC from F. fujikuroi B14 (FfB14) consists of nine genes, including a positively acting pathway&#8208;specific transcription factor, which although absent in some fusaria, functions in activating other PKS16 cluster genes. Moreover, we linked the PKS16 BGC to the biosynthesis of proliferapyrone (PRO) E, an isomer of the recently isolated PRO A.

         <title>Investigation of the Mechanism of Action of Natural and Synthetic Monoterpenoids: For a New Route in Antimycotic Molecules</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
4&#8208;Bromothymol shows a stunning in&#8201;vivo antimycotic efficacy, even on resistant molds and yeast. Discrete Fourier transform and molecular dynamics approaches reveal that 4&#8208;bromothymol has a high affinity toward the bilayer. Noteworthy, it forms a hydrogen bond with the oxygen of the phosphate in the lipid head, altering its structure and conceivably triggering a &#8220;domino effect&#8221; that affects the overall membrane stability.

Monoterpenoids are well&#8208;recognized natural antimycotic agents, but their mechanism of action is still unclear. Interestingly, synthetic derivatives, such as 4&#8208;bromothymol (4&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;isopropyl&#8208;5&#8208;methylphenol), are emerging as promising alternatives to natural molecules, due to their even greater biological activity. Herein, the antimycotic efficacy of 4&#8208;bromothymol is evaluated: in vivo experiments on species of acclaimed resistance demonstrate that 4&#8208;bromothymol has a minimum inhibitory concentration up to 6 times lower than thymol. In silico investigations, sweeping from partition coefficient (LogP) determination through density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations based on a minimum bias approach, support its improved antifungal activity with respect to thymol, carvacrol, and thymyl acetate. A structural insight of the mechanism of action is proposed. Even though all the analyzed compounds are able to penetrate the cellular membrane, 4&#8208;bromothymol shows a higher predicted affinity for the bilayer, and it causes a strong perturbation at the water/bilayer interface, altering the stability of the membrane, thus leading to cell death.

         <title>Designing Enzymatic Reactivity with an Expanded Palette</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovation in biocatalysis is rapidly increasingly the diversity of catalytic reactivity that can be mediated by enzymes, addressing a key bottleneck for their widespread adoption in industrial chemical synthesis. A key approach to this is building enzymes with unnatural catalytic components that provide an expanded palette with new possibilities for enzymatic reactivity.

The expanding applications of biocatalysis in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors herald a greener future for these industries. Yet, the range of chemical reactions known to enzymes only covers a small fraction of what is required for modern synthetic routes. To continue the increases in sustainability afforded by converting chemical processes into enzymatic ones, fundamentally new kinds of biocatalytic reactivity are required. Perhaps the very components from which enzymes are constructed, a palette of canonical amino acids and cofactors, inherently limit their catalytic possibilities, even if all the available natural sequence space can be explored. In recent years, there has been an explosion of strategies to produce new biocatalytic function through the incorporation of noncanonical amino acids and synthetic cofactors, new colors which are added to the enzyme design palette. This has enabled new enzymatic reactions that proceed via organocatalytic, organometallic, and photocatalytic mechanisms. Aside from designing new enzymatic activities from scratch, exogenous photocatalysts have recently also been used in synergy with natural enzyme active sites to diverge their reactivity towards radical pathways. This review will highlight recent developments in enriching enzymatic chemistry with new unnatural components, providing an outlook for future directions and needed developments for practicality and sustainability.

         <title>Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Separation of Supercharged Green Fluorescence Proteins in the Polyamine Biosynthetic Pathway Deleted E. coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation of charged proteins was examined using super charged GFP in the polyamine synthetase knock down HT873 strain. Following ATP depletion and polyamine treatment, negatively charged GFP (&#8722;27) exhibited phase separation through charge&#8208;charge interactions with polyamines, indicating that polyamines are the main drivers for the formation of condensates of negatively charged proteins.

Protein liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) has attracted significant attention due to its involvement in cellular functions and has been believed to be the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the primary mechanisms governing its formation and function remain unclear. Since most of proteins involved in condensation in cells are charged, it is hypothesized that charge&#8211;charge interactions mediated by small charged biomolecules, such as adenosine tri&#8208;phosphate (ATP) and polyamines, would be the primary driving force behind the protein LLPS. In the previous study, it is showed that small charged biomolecules are to be a main driver of protein LLPS through charge&#8211;charge interaction. Furthermore, multivalently charged small molecules play a crucial role in creating protein condensates when the protein themselves are charged, effectively acting as bridges between charged proteins. Having said that, the effect of endogenous polyamine molecules in protein condensation in cells could not be ruled out. In this study, an E. coli strain is utilized with a polyamine synthetase knocked&#8208;down, HT873, to investigate the role of polyamines in the aggregation of both negatively and positively charged green fluorescence proteins. This study suggests that both ATP and polyamine, as small charged biomolecules, play critical roles in the LLPS of charged proteins in cells.

         <title>Macrocycles of Saxitoxin: Insights into the Structure of Zetekitoxin AB</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic macrocycles of (+)&#8208;saxitoxin, the causative agent of paralytic shellfish poisoning, have been prepared. These are designed to mimic the macrocyclic core of the proposed structure for zetekitoxin AB. Interestingly, these synthetic macrocycles do not form the C12 hydrate as commonly observed in this family of toxins, casting doubt on the presence of a macrocycle in zetekitoxin AB.

Zeteketoxin AB is the only macrocyclic member of the bis&#8208;guanidinium ion toxins, and the only member reported to be more potent than the parent (+)&#8208;saxitoxin. A rationale for this exquisite potency remains difficult to develop due to the scarcity of natural material and a lack of consensus around the specific structure of the toxin itself. A strategy is reported, leveraging an intramolecular Michael addition to forge macrocycles bridging the saxitoxin core, mimicking the proposed structure of zetekitoxin AB. Intriguingly, these analogs do not form a hydrate at C12. Experimental and computational studies suggest that a macrocyclic framework destabilizes the hydrate, casting doubt on the presence of a macrocycle in zetekitoxin.

     alt="Macrocycles of Saxitoxin: Insights into the Structure of Zetekitoxin AB"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthetic macrocycles of (+)-saxitoxin, the causative agent of paralytic shellfish poisoning, have been prepared. These are designed to mimic the macrocyclic core of the proposed structure for zetekitoxin AB. Interestingly, these synthetic macrocycles do not form the C12 hydrate as commonly observed in this family of toxins, casting doubt on the presence of a macrocycle in zetekitoxin AB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zeteketoxin AB is the only macrocyclic member of the bis-guanidinium ion toxins, and the only member reported to be more potent than the parent (+)-saxitoxin. A rationale for this exquisite potency remains difficult to develop due to the scarcity of natural material and a lack of consensus around the specific structure of the toxin itself. A strategy is reported, leveraging an intramolecular Michael addition to forge macrocycles bridging the saxitoxin core, mimicking the proposed structure of zetekitoxin AB. Intriguingly, these analogs do not form a hydrate at C12. Experimental and computational studies suggest that a macrocyclic framework destabilizes the hydrate, casting doubt on the presence of a macrocycle in zetekitoxin. Preliminary activity screening utilizing calcium imaging-based constellation pharmacology demonstrates several analogs to have potent pharmacological activity similar to (+)-saxitoxin despite the lack of the C12 hydrated ketone.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell&#8208;free protein synthesis (CFPS) is extensively applied in biotechnological research. Unlike the lysate&#8208;based CFPS system, the alternative purified cell&#8208;free system, Protein synthesis Using Recombinant Elements (PURE), has garnered a great attention due to its controllability and flexibility of adjusting individual component for in vitro transcription and translation research. The PURE system has been widely studied in the synthetic biological field, and optimized for its application in prototyping research, non&#8208;canonical amino acid incorporation and synthetic cell construction. Herein, we discuss the recent optimization strategies for a simple and enhanced PURE system. In addition, the recent application via the PURE system and the current challenges for the development of a more robust and controllable PURE are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Induction and manipulation of biomolecular condensates through spatially heterogeneous solution conditions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study of biomolecular condensates (BMCs) is of great current interest because of the proposed roles of these types of assemblies in biological function and disease. In living cells, BMCs form in a highly heterogeneous environment and are influenced by concentration gradients of various relevant species. Furthermore, the biological functionality of the BMCs requires precise spatial control of their formation in some cases. In recent years, a number of in vitro experimental approaches have emerged that allow the generation, study and manipulation of BMCs through the creation of well&#8208;defined spatially heterogeneous solution conditions relevant for BMC formation. In this Concept article I will present in what way such methods can contribute to improved understanding and control of BMCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioorthogonal Post&#8208;Labeling Reveals Nuclear Localization of a Highly Cytotoxic Half&#8208;sandwich Ir(III) Tetrazine Complex in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intracellular imaging of anticancer metallodrugs often relies on pre&#8208;labeling with organic fluorophores, which significantly affects their physicochemical properties and intracellular distribution. On the other hand, the reported post&#8208;labeling strategies based on click&#8208;chemistry reactions require cell fixation and permeabilization. Here, we present a post&#8208;labeling approach based on the catalyst&#8208;free, inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder reaction (iEDDA) between a strained fluorescein&#8208;tagged bicyclononyne derivative (BCN&#8208;FAM) and half&#8208;sandwich Ir(III) complexes containing bidentate ligands comprising a tetrazine (Tz&#8208;R,R&#8217;) entity. Five half&#8208;sandwich Ir(III) complexes with formula [Cp*Ir(Tz&#8208;R,R&#8217;)Cl]0/+&#160;have been synthesized and fully characterized, including the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of three of the five derivatives. Investigations of their stability and their reactivity in aqueous solution and in a model iEDDA reaction revealed&#160;the strong influence of the tetrazine ligand structure on the chemical properties of the corresponding complexes.&#160;A highly cytotoxic metallodrug candidate (Ir&#8208;C,NPh,Me)&#160;was identified from&#160;biological studies,&#160;and chemical reactivity studies disclosed an unusual preference for binding of methionine over cysteine.&#160;Post&#8208;labeling&#160;of&#160;Ir&#8208;C,NPh,Me&#160;in&#160;live&#160;HeLa cells highlighted its preferential accumulation within the nucleus, suggesting its retention through covalent modifications of nuclear proteins in good agreement with other half&#8208;sandwich iridium(III) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of&#160; endogenous sequences interacting with METTL3/METTL14 RNA methyltransferase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant RNA modification in mRNA and regulates various biological processes. The RNA&#8208;binding properties of m6A writer proteins play an important role in determining RNA modification sites. METTL3 and METTL14 form the core of the m6A writer complex, with METTL3 as the catalytic methyltransferase and METTL14 as the RNA&#8208;binding scaffold. Thus far, the comprehensive RNA binding properties of METTL3/14 remain unknown. Using RNA&#8208;capturing microsphere particles (R&#8208;CAMPs), immobilizing RNA fragments derived from endogenous RNAs of human lung carcinoma cells, we isolated RNA fragments that interacted with the METTL3/14 methyltransferase domain. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the pool of isolated sequences contained significantly more regions with the potential to form RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (rG4s) than the randomly extracted RNA sequence pool and that the (GGA) repeat sequences were most enriched. CD spectroscopy, gel mobility shift assays, and methylation experiments demonstrated that METTL3/14 binds to RNA sequences containing (GGA) repeats that form rG4 structure much stronger than RNAs that do not form rG4s. This study shows the potential of RNA G&#8208;quadruplex structures as a modulator of epitranscriptomic modification of m6As.</dc:description>

         <title>SAAP&#8208;148 oligomerizes into a hexamer forming a hydrophobic inner core</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human cathelicidin LL&#8208;37 is a widely studied antimicrobial 37&#8208;mer peptide with various ascribed functions, that serves as a template for designing novel peptides. Its derivative, the 24&#8208;mer SAAP&#8208;148, is highly effective in vitro in eradicating multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria, persistent cells, and biofilms, without inducing resistance. SAAP&#8208;148 is characterized by a high cationic charge (+11) and 46% hydrophobicity, which, once the peptide folds into an alpha helix, forms a wide hydrophobic face. This highly amphipathic nature facilitates on the one hand its insertion into the membrane's fatty acyl chain region and on the other hand it&#180;s interaction with anionic membrane components, which contributes to its mode of action in killing bacteria. However, the contributions of the secondary and quaternary structures remain underexplored. To address this, we conducted a study using anionic and zwitterionic membrane models, applying circular dichroism, NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray scattering, AlphaFold 3 and molecular dynamics simulations. Our results reveal that SAAP&#8208;148 adopts a stable hexameric bundle composed of three parallel dimers, creating a hydrophobic core of aromatic residues. This structure is retained at the membrane interface, where MD simulations suggest the formation of a fiber&#8208;like structure on anionic membranes, most likely driven by exposed cationic side chains.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Conjugation Method of CpG&#8208;ODN Adjuvant to Intact Virions for Vaccine Development</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vaccines are a pivotal achievement in public health, offering inexpensive, distributable and highly effective protection against infectious diseases. Despite significant advancements in vaccine development, there are still many diseases for which vaccines are unavailable or offer limited protection. The global impact of the deficiency in vaccine&#8208;induced immunity against these diseases is profound, leading to increased rates of illness, more frequent hospitalizations, and higher mortality rates. Recent studies have demonstrated conjugation mechanisms and delivery methods to co&#8208;present adjuvants and protein epitopes to antigen&#8208;presenting cells, significantly enhancing adaptive immunity. We introduce a novel approach to incorporate an adjuvant into the vaccine by covalently attaching it to whole enveloped virions. Using "clickable" azide&#8208;enabled viral particles, generated through metabolic incorporation of N&#8208;azidoacetyl glucosamine (GlcNAz), we conjugated the virions with a cyclo&#8208;octyne&#8208;modified CpG&#8208;ODN. Conjugation yielded a potent adjuvant&#8208;virus complex, eliciting higher TLR9&#8208;mediated cell activation of cultured bone marrow&#8208;derived macrophages relative to co&#8208;administered adjuvants and virions. Administration of covalent adjuvant&#8208;virion conjugates increase immune cell stimulation and may provide a generalizable and effective strategy for eliciting a heightened immune response for vaccine development.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Tetrazine Substituents to Enhance Vinyltetrazine Labeling Performance</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The site&#8208;specific labelling of peptides and proteins is a powerful tool for investigating biological processes. We demonstrated that the powerful thiol&#8208;specific labelling reagent vinyltetrazine activates pro&#8208;drugs and enables 18F and near&#8208;infrared dual&#8208;modality imaging. We predicted that substitutions at the 3&#8208;position of tetrazine could affect the labelling efficiency, bioorthogonal kinetics, and stability. Six vinyltetrazines with different 3&#8208;position modifications exhibited rapid labelling, and subsequently, bioorthogonal kinetics and excellent stability. Vinyltetrazine labelling modified the charge characteristics and lipophilicity of target peptides, thereby improving cellular uptake. This research on tuning tetrazine substituents will aid in the construction of a comprehensive vinyltetrazine library, leading to the development of new peptide conjugates and pre&#8208;targeted immuno&#8208;positron emission tomography (immune&#8208;PET) imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Lipid Metabolism and Immune Function: &#160;Chemical Tools for Insights into T&#8208;Cell Biology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipids are essential biomolecules playing critical roles in cellular processes, including energy storage, membrane structure, and signaling. This review highlights the chemical tools that have been developed to study the role of lipid metabolism in immune function, focusing on T&#8208;cell biology. Fatty acids (FAs), as core lipid components, influence immune responses through structural, signaling, and metabolic roles. Recent studies reveal how specific FAs modulate T&#8208;cell activation, proliferation, and function, with implications for regulatory and effector subsets. Emerging tools, such as fluorescence&#8208;based lipids and click chemistry, enable precise tracking of lipid uptake and metabolism at single&#8208;cell levels, addressing limitations of traditional bulk methods. Advances in metabolomics and proteomics offer further insights into lipid&#8208;mediated immune regulation. Understanding these mechanisms provides opportunities for targeting lipid metabolism in therapeutic strategies for cancer and other immune&#8208;related diseases. The integration of lipidomic technologies into immunology uncovers novel perspectives on how lipids shape immune responses at cellular and molecular scales.</dc:description>

         <title>Cold&#8208;Adapted Lipid A from Polaribacter sp. SM1127: A Study of Structural Heterogeneity and Immunostimulatory properties</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polaribacter sp. SM1127, a cold&#8208;adapted marine Gram&#8208;negative bacterium isolated from Laminaria in Arctic waters, plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling and biopolymer degradation in cold environments. Additionally, its exopolysaccharide (EPS) exhibits promising biotechnological potential, including antioxidant and wound&#8208;healing properties. This study focuses on the isolation and characterization of lipid A, the glycolipid component of Polaribacter sp. SM1127 lipopolysaccharide (LPS), by bypassing full LPS extraction and working directly with the ethanol precipitation product containing both EPS and bacterial cells. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed significant structural heterogeneity in the lipid A, with variations in fatty acid chain length, branching, saturation and hydroxylation. These features likely enable the bacterium to fine&#8208;tune its response to fluctuating temperatures or other cold&#8208;related environmental stresses, contributing to resilience in the Arctic Ocean ecosystem. Furthermore, immunological assays demonstrated that both LPS and EPS produced by Polaribacter sp. SM1127 induce weak TLR4 activation and, in general, poorly stimulate the NF&#8208;kB pathway, compared to E. coli LPS. These findings suggest their potential as immunomodulatory agents, like vaccine adjuvants.</dc:description>

Molecular Tweezers for Biomimetic Recognition of Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular tweezers have emerged as effective binders for biomolecules such as lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins, eliciting biological activities. Tweezer molecules, which exploit an open and adaptive binding cavity, can target relatively large guests, such as oligosaccharides and glycans, and often provide some advantages over corresponding macrocyclic architectures.

Molecular recognition of biomolecules by means of synthetic receptors is a key topic with several potential applications, which must face the challenge of recognizing relatively large guests in an aqueous medium. Due to their open cavity, molecular tweezers are promising architectures for this purpose that have already shown interesting recognition properties with lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins, thereby eliciting biological activities. Carbohydrates, assembled within glycans, are polar biomolecules of high structural complexity that are particularly difficult to be effectively recognized in water. Notably, in addition to reports on more widely explored structures, significant advances have been achieved exploiting the structural peculiarity of tweezer receptors. In this review a selection of some emblematic examples from the literature of molecular tweezers, cleft and clips targeting carbohydrates is presented, together with a discussion of the advantages and limitations of this type of architecture.

         <title>Exploring Aspartate Transcarbamoylase: A Promising Broad&#8208;Spectrum Target for Drug Development</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrimidine biosynthesis is a pivotal process shared by both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. This review examines the applications and advantages of a series of inhibitors specifically designed to target aspartate transcarbamylase within the de novo biosynthetic pathway of the malarial parasite. Members of this small molecule series have also shown inhibitory activity against a range of other organisms, suggesting a common scaffold may provide solutions to a number of biomedical challenges







Abstract
Pyrimidine nucleotides are essential for a wide variety of cellular processes and are synthesized either via a salvage pathway or through de novo biosynthesis. The latter is particularly important in proliferating cells, such as infectious diseases and cancer cells. Aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) catalyzes the first committed and rate&#8208;limiting step in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, making it an attractive therapeutic target for various diseases. This review summarizes the development of a series of allosteric ATCase inhibitors, advancing them as potential candidates for malarial, tuberculosis and cancer therapies. Furthermore, it explores the potential for these compounds to be expanded into drugs targeting neglected tropical diseases, antimicrobial&#8208;resistant infections caused by the ESKAPE pathogens, and their possible application as herbicides. We identify the likely equivalent allosteric pocket in these systems and perform a structure and sequence&#8208;based analysis of the residues comprising it, providing a rationale for continued exploration of this compound series as both specific and broad&#8208;range inhibitors. The review concludes by emphasizing the importance of continued research into ATCase inhibitors, given their potential broad applicability in treating diverse diseases to enhance both human health and agricultural practices.

Two lactate dehydrogenases, chicken l&#8208;lactate dehydrogenases (l&#8208;LDH) from Gallus and d&#8208;LmLDH from Leuconostoc mesenteroides, are screened for high reductive activity and stereoselectivity toward 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxopropionic acid, achieving 99% enantiomeric excess for (R) and (S), respectively. Formate dehydrogenase from Candida boidinii is used to construct stereocomplementary reactions with chicken l&#8208;LDH and d&#8208;LmLDH, enabling efficient synthesis of chiral (2R)&#8208; and (2S)&#8208;3,3,3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypropanoic acid.

Chiral 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypropanoic acid (3,3,3&#8208;trifluorolactic acid, TFLA), which possesses two significant functional groups, is a versatile intermediate in pharmaceutical and material synthesis. A feasible strategy for producing both the enantiomers of chiral TFLAs involves reduction of the corresponding pyruvate using lactate dehydrogenases (LDHs). In this study, ldh genes encoding l&#8208;LDHs from animals and d/l&#8208;LDHs from lactic acid bacteria are cloned and all the recombinant LDHs are successfully expressed with a histidine tag in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). To achieve cofactor regeneration, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide regeneration system is constructed using formate dehydrogenase from Candida boidinii. Chiral TFLA is synthesized from 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxopropionic acid (trifluoropyruvic acid, TFPy) with good yields and excellent stereoselectivity, catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenases and formate dehydrogenase. Under optimized biocatalytic conditions, highly active d&#8208;LmLDH from Leuconostoc mesenteroides and chicken l&#8208;LDH from Gallus are screened for their ability to completely convert 0.5&#8201;m TFPy to produce optically pure (S)&#8208;TFLA and (R)&#8208;TFLA with enantiomeric excess &gt;99.5% within 6&#8201;h, respectively. Molecular docking simulations investigate the catalytic mechanisms of selected d&#8208;LDH and l&#8208;LDH, revealing their activity and stereoselectivity toward &#63743;CF3&#8208;containing TFPy.

         <title>Leaf&#8208;like nanostructures self&#8208;assembled by silver&#8208;coordinated photosensitizers as collaborative antimicrobial agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This research introduces an innovative approach to addressing bacterial infections in wounds using leaf&#8208;like nanostructures, which are self&#8208;assembled via coordination between the photosensitizer Cz&#8208;BTZ&#8208;mPy and silver ions. These nanostructures combine photosensitizer&#8208;generated singlet oxygen with silver's antibacterial effects, synergistically promoting wound healing. When incorporated into a Carbopol 941 hydrogel matrix, these nanostructures achieve near&#8208;total bacterial eradication (0.04% survival) while accelerating wound healing and tissue regeneration in a mouse model. This dual&#8208;functional mechanism allows the nanostructures to perform exceptionally well against Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, even in biofilm environments, where conventional strategies solely on individual components often fail.</dc:description>

         <title>Profiling Serine Hydrolases in the Leishmania Host&#8208;Pathogen Interactome Using Cell&#8208;Permeable Activity&#8208;Based Fluorophosphonate Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Leishmaniasis, a vector borne neglected tropical disease, caused by the protozoan parasite&#160;Leishmania, is a major global public health challenge with millions of new cases annually.&#160;Treatment of leishmaniasis is difficult for many reasons including a multiple life&#8208;cycle stages, involving both an infective insect vector form, the promastigote, and a disease causing intracellular mammalian host form, the amastigote, and increasing drug&#8208;tolerance that are all linked by the interplay between parasite and host.&#160;We employed activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) using new cell&#8208;permeable fluorophosphonate probes to explore serine hydrolases (SHs) in&#160;Leishmania mexicana&#160;with subsequent analysis enabled by secondary reaction with an affinity reagent. Importantly, these cell&#8208;permeable probes can access all life&#8208;cycle stages including the disease&#8208;critical intramacrophage amastigote. Probe efficacy is a combination of both target engagement and subsequent accessibility to the affinity agent. Fourteen SHs, including peptidases and lipases, were identified in the&#160;L. mexicana&#160;proteome with comparative profiling of different parasite life&#8208;stages revealing significant changes in SH activity across the life&#8208;cycle stages. This intra&#8208;cellular ABPP approach provides insights into the host&#8208;parasite interactome demonstrating that SHs function as important virulence factors with Z&#8208;Pro&#8208;Prolinal, a known prolyloligopeptidase inhibitor, being able to reduce parasite infectivity in the macrophage by altering multiple SH targets.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioactive specialized metabolites from Staphylococcus: diversity, biosynthesis and biotechnological potential.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Staphylococci are a heterogeneous group of bacteria capable of colonizing diverse ecological niches and adopting a wide variety of lifestyles. While several strains are known as notorious, multidrug&#8208;resistant human pathogens, others are harmless inhabitants of soil, water and food products, or beneficial members of the skin microbiota. To survive and remain competitive under challenging environmental conditions, staphylococci have evolved the ability to assemble and secrete a diverse range of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides, nonribosomal peptides, terpenes, siderophores and other specialized metabolites with antibiotic, immunomodulating and metal chelating activities. In this review, we provide an overview of the bioactive metabolite arsenal of staphylococci with a focus on their biosynthetic pathway, mode of action and industrial application potential. We also highlight unexplored natural product biosynthetic pathways in staphylococci, along with strategies to access this hidden potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Loop Dynamics in Reshaping the Conformation of YB&#8208;1 Cold Shock Domain</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals the regulatory role of the C&#8208;terminal loop in stabilizing the YB&#8208;1 cold shock domain (CSD). Through molecular dynamics simulations, NMR, and crosslinking, it identifies a critical interaction network formed by the loop. Phosphorylation at S102 disrupts this network, altering CSD dynamics, stability, and DNA binding affinity.







Abstract
The human Y&#8208;box binding protein 1 (YB&#8208;1) plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. The cold shock domain (CSD) of YB&#8208;1 is responsible for specific nucleic acid recognition and exhibits a unique &#946;&#8208;barrel structure. While the CSD alone is unstable, the addition of 11 residues at the C&#8208;terminus significantly stabilizes the structure. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms by which this extended loop region influences the structure and dynamics of the CSD using all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, complemented by NMR and crosslinking experiments. Our simulations reveal that the extended loop forms a sandwich&#8208;like interaction network with the CSD, stabilizing the overall structure. This network involves hydrogen bonds and non&#8208;covalent interactions, preventing the loop from collapsing due to electrostatic attractions. Furthermore, we show that phosphorylation of S102 within the loop region disrupts this network, leading to increased structural flexibility and conformational changes. This disruption weakens the interaction between CSD and DNA, explaining the experimentally observed decrease in binding affinity upon phosphorylation. Our results provide mechanistic insights into the role of loop dynamics in reshaping the conformation of the YB&#8208;1 CSD.

         <title>Recombinant Production and Characterization of Six Ene&#8208;reductases from Penicillium steckii</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the catalytic potential of novel ene&#8208;reductases (ERs) from Penicillium steckii, a fungal species known for valuable metabolites. Through the recombinant production and purification of six ERs, we identified diverse substrate profiles and moderate stability. Elucidation of the crystal structure of one ER (PsOYE2) revealed unique active site features. This set of recombinant Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE)&#8208;type ERs can be explored for future biocatalytic applications.







Abstract
Fungi, known for their adaptability, are valuable sources of enzymes, making them promising for biocatalyst discovery. This study explored Penicillium steckii, primarily recognized for secondary metabolite production, as a source of ene&#8208;reductases (ERs), which reduce &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated compounds. Eleven ER&#8208;encoding genes were identified, and plasmids for Escherichia coli expression were generated. Six ERs (PsOYE1&#8208;6) were successfully produced and purified as soluble FMN&#8208;containing proteins. Sequence analysis classified them into Class II (PsOYE1, PsOYE4, PsOYE6), Class III (PsOYE2, PsOYE3), and Class V (PsOYE5) OYEs. All were active on p&#8208;benzoquinone and maleimide, with varying activity on other substrates. Their pH optima ranged from 6 to 7, and they exhibited moderate thermostability (35&#8211;50&#8201;&#176;C). PsOYE2 was crystallized, and its 2.3&#8197;&#197; structure revealed a stable dimer with a unique active site. PsOYE3, PsOYE4, and PsOYE5 were tested for R&#8208;carvone conversion and stereoselectivity, all favouring one diastereomer. These fungal ERs expand the enzymatic toolbox for biocatalysis, emphasizing the need for tailored strategies based on specific applications.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Cobalt Alloy@Graphene&#8208;Engineered Milk Extracellular Vesicles for Gastric Retentive Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To establish a gastric&#8208;retentive drug delivery system, FeCo@G&#8208;engineered milk extracellular vesicles are developed. This platform integrates the protective properties of milk extracellular vesicles, shielding drugs from degradation, with FeCo@G's robust magnetic retention capabilities. These features enable efficient mucosal penetration and significantly extend gastric retention time, enhancing therapeutic efficacy in gastric environments.







Abstract
Oral drug delivery is widely used for treating gastric diseases as it allows drugs to act directly on gastric lesions, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes. However, its efficacy is hindered by the specific gastric environment, such as the gastric mucosal barrier, which limits drug penetration, and the short gastric emptying time, which results in transient residence time. Raw milk&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles (M&#8208;EVs) offer promise as a gastric drug delivery platform. Their high cellular affinity, stability under gastrointestinal conditions, and ability to protect drugs from acidic and enzymatic degradation make them suitable for this purpose. Incorporating mangetic nanoparticles encapsulated in M&#8208;EV provides magnetic navigation and active mucosal penetration capabilities. Herein, we developed a gastric drug delivery system based on iron&#8208;cobalt alloy@graphene (FeCo@G)&#8208;engineered M&#8208;EV (M&#8208;FNP). M&#8208;FNP serves as a versatile drug carrier that can load both small molecules and proteins through simple physical approach. And it demonstrates stability in the simulated gastric fluid system for at least 6&#8197;hours. Under magnetic field guidance, it penetrates the simulated mucosal layer and is internalized by cells within 4&#8197;hours significantly enhancing cellular drug uptake. M&#8208;FNP is expected to serve as an innovative drug delivery platform with enhanced retention capabilities within the stomach.

         <title>A Cryptic Loop that Modulates Protein&#8208;Protein Interaction: Implications in PfAMA1&#8208;PfRON2 Late&#8208;stage Binding Event</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of computational and experimental approaches revealed the role of a cryptic loop in the late&#8208;stage binding of Plasmodium falciparum proteins PfAMA1 and PfRON2, crucial for malaria parasite entry into human red blood cells. Simulations captured loop dynamics, while experiments validated binding kinetics, identifying, fort the first time, key residues in PfRON2&#8217;s helix region essential for binding.







Abstract
Disease&#8208;related protein&#8208;protein interactions are important molecular targets for drug discovery campaigns. The dynamics of a disordered loop, which are commonly found in the receptor binding domain of many proteins, often plays a decisive role during protein&#8208;protein or protein&#8208;small molecule binding events. One notable example is the interactions between two proteins from Plasmodium falciparum, PfAMA1&#8208;PfRON2, which are crucial for the malaria parasite's invasion into human red blood cells. A thorough understanding of the interactions between these macromolecular binding partners is important for designing better therapeutics against this ancient disease. The available crystal structures of the PfAMA1&#8208;PfRON2 complex show insufficient electron density, making it challenging to fully understand the molecular&#8208;level association of the domain II (DII) loop with the PfRON2. To address this, we have computationally simulated the dynamics and free energetics of DII loop closing processes, identifying a set of key amino acid residues in the PfRON2 helix that are essential for binding. The subsequent experimental validation of the relative importance of residues in context provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular recognition event between PfAMA1 and PfRON2, specifically in the post&#8208;binding stage. This insight could potentially open up new avenues to drug discovery against malaria.

         <title>Expanding the Substrate Scope of C&#8722;N Lyases by Homologue Discovery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homology&#8208;based strategy is employed to identify and biochemically characterize 13 enzymes homologous to ethylenediamine&#8208;N,N&#8208;disuccinic acid (EDDS) lyase. Several homologues exhibit a broadened substrate scope, accepting L&#8208;amino acids for the enantioselective hydroamination of fumarate to produce the corresponding aminopolycarboxylic acids. Further bioinformatic analysis of the aspartase/fumarase superfamily suggests that EDDS lyase and its homologues represent an underexplored isofunctional subfamily.







Abstract
The aspartase/fumarase superfamily is a group of homologous enzymes that promote the reversible elimination of functional groups from succinyl&#8208;containing compounds, typically yielding fumarate as the common product. Over the past 50&#8197;years, members of this superfamily have continuously demonstrated their power and significance as biocatalysts. This is exemplified by ethylenediamine&#8208;N,N&#8208;disuccinic acid (EDDS) lyase, which was shown to have an extraordinary amine scope, enabling the production of a wide variety of N&#8208;substituted aspartic acids. In this work, we used this enzyme as a starting point for a homology&#8208;based strategy to expand the biocatalytic toolbox of C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming enzymes. We selected 13 enzymes for biochemical characterization, and identified several EDDS&#8208;lyase homologues that can accept L&#8208;amino acids as substrates in the hydroamination of fumarate to produce the corresponding aminopolycarboxylic acids. Lastly, we carried out a sequence similarity network analysis of the aspartase/fumarase superfamily, which suggests that EDDS lyase and its homologues may represent a distinct isofunctional subfamily, laying the foundations for future enzyme discovery and engineering campaigns.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Component Reactions in Protein Modification and Immobilization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the role of multi&#8208;component reactions (MCRs) in protein immobilization and modification is highlighted. MCRs are particularly significant in protein chemistry due to their advantages, such as the ability to be conducted under physiological conditions and the simultaneous attachment of multiple functional groups to proteins.







Abstract
Protein modification/immobilization has been introduced as a large toolbox for creating a myriad of engineered proteins with profound implications for various scientific and industrial applications. Proteins immobilization techniques are generally performed through protein fixation in/to heterogeneous materials or via inter cross&#8208;linking of protein molecules, enabling the development of biocatalysts, biosensors, and drug delivery systems. On the other hand, chemical modification of proteins offers tailored changes in their functionality, enhances protein performance, extends their shelf life, and enables their specific binding interactions. The choice of immobilization or modification technique depends on the significance of various factors for the final product. Chemical coupling methods that create covalent bonds are commonly used for both proposes. Multi&#8208;component reactions are particularly effective because they operate under mild conditions to maintain protein functionality while simultaneously introducing multiple functional groups.

     alt="Multi-Component Reactions in Protein Modification and Immobilization"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this review, the role of multi-component reactions (MCRs) in protein immobilization and modification is highlighted. MCRs are particularly significant in protein chemistry due to their advantages, such as the ability to be conducted under physiological conditions and the simultaneous attachment of multiple functional groups to proteins.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein modification/immobilization has been introduced as a large toolbox for creating a myriad of engineered proteins with profound implications for various scientific and industrial applications. Proteins immobilization techniques are generally performed through protein fixation in/to heterogeneous materials or via inter cross-linking of protein molecules, enabling the development of biocatalysts, biosensors, and drug delivery systems. On the other hand, chemical modification of proteins offers tailored changes in their functionality, enhances protein performance, extends their shelf life, and enables their specific binding interactions. The choice of immobilization or modification technique depends on the significance of various factors for the final product. Chemical coupling methods that create covalent bonds are commonly used for both proposes. Multi-component reactions are particularly effective because they operate under mild conditions to maintain protein functionality while simultaneously introducing multiple functional groups. This review provides an overview of multi-component reactions employed for the immobilization and modification of proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#946;&#8208;Turn Mimicking Crosslinking Provides Hyperstability and Fast Folding Kinetics for Short Collagen Triple Helices</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Collagen triple helices and &#946;&#8208;turns are compatible chemical motifs to fuse based on their identical H&#8208;bond geometry. The resulting collagen triple helices are intramolecularly folded, exhibiting high stability and fast folding kinetics. Besides serving as a scaffold structure for designing short, stable, heterotrimeric collagen triple helices, the bis &#946;&#8208;turn collagen peptides were used to deconvolute a two&#8208;step collagen folding mechanism as a kinetic model.







Abstract
Creating stabilized peptide mimics of the collagen triple helix is challenging, especially for collagen heterotrimers. Interstrand sidechain crosslinking offers a useful approach, though this strategy can suffer from destabilizing structural perturbations, sequence limitations and synthetic complexity. Herein, we show that the geometry of hydrogen bonding in the collagen triple helix is compatible with installation of terminal &#946;&#8208;turn&#8208;mimicking linkers at the N&#8208;terminal and C&#8208;terminal ends of the triple helix. These double&#8208;turn&#8208;containing collagen peptide mimics fold into highly stable, intramolecular triple helical structures, providing access to profoundly miniaturized triple helix mimics. Intramolecular triple helix formation exhibits significantly accelerated folding kinetics. Comprehensive kinetic analysis reveals that the rate&#8208;limiting step of folding is distinct at low and high temperatures, affording unique insight into the mechanism.

         <title>Characterization of ActVI&#8208;ORF3 and ActVI&#8208;ORF4 as Lactonizing and Delactonizing Enzymes in Relation to Metabolic Flux in Actinorhodin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We identified ActVI&#8208;ORF3 as a cofactor&#8208;independent enzyme that exhibits lactonization activity toward compounds with the same stereochemistry as actinorhodin. ActVI&#8208;ORF4 functioned as an NAD(P)&#8208;dependent oxidoreductase that catalyzes the delactonization of benzoisochomanequinone lactones. ActVI&#8208;ORF3 contributed significantly to lactonization of related compounds in the metabolic flux of actinorhodin biosynthesis, whereas the contribution of delactonization of ActVI&#8208;ORF4 was less pronounced.







Abstract
Actinorhodin (ACT) from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) is an aromatic polyketide antibiotic with a benzoisochromanequinone (BIQ) skeleton. Although actVI&#8208;ORF3 and actVI&#8208;ORF4 are not essential for ACT biosynthesis, homologous genes to these are present in the biosynthetic gene clusters of BIQ lactones. In this study, ActVI&#8208;ORF3 was identified as a cofactor&#8208;independent enzyme with lactonization activity, using ACT as a substrate. ActVI&#8208;ORF3 recognized dihydrokalafungin and 8&#8208;hydroxykalafafungin, which share the same pyran&#8208;ring configuration as ACT, but not nanaomycin A, which has an opposite configuration. In contrast, ActVI&#8208;ORF4 functioned as an NAD(P)&#8208;dependent oxidoreductase, catalyzing the delactonization of BIQ lactones. Conversion experiments using isotopically labeled compounds revealed that both lactonization and delactonization reactions of these enzymes yielded products in which the carboxyl oxygen at the C1 position was retained. Subsequently, we reexamined the accumulation of ACT&#8208;related compounds in the actVI&#8208;ORF3 and actVI&#8208;ORF&#8208;4 disruptants. The results suggested that ACT intermediates are predominantly pooled in the bacteria as (S)&#8208;DNPA rather than in lactone&#8208;form. The contribution of ActVI&#8208;ORF4 to metabolic flux is not significant, and endogenous reductases can convert these intermediates to the dihydro form, which subsequently re&#8208;enters the ACT biosynthetic pathway.

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor (Perylenethienyl)Ethylenes as Singlet Oxygen&#8208;Photogenerating Viral Inhibitors
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and evaluation of electron&#8208;withdrawing group (EWG)&#8208;containing (perylenethienyl)ethylenes with an extended &#960;&#8208;system reveal a promising approach towards red&#8208;shifted, broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral photosensitizers.







Abstract
The development of broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral drugs effective against a wide range of viruses is of significant practical importance. Derivatives of perylene, a pentacyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, demonstrate pronounced antiviral activity. These compounds act primarily as membrane&#8208;active singlet oxygen photogenerators, disrupting virions and inhibiting their fusion with the host cell membrane. Modification of the perylene core allows for chemical diversification of antiviral photosensitizers. Additionally, achieving a bathochromic shift of the absorption band is crucial for effective treatment of superficial lesions, as it facilitates deeper tissue penetration of therapeutic light. In this work, donor&#8208;acceptor perylenylethylenes and (perylenethienyl)ethylenes were synthesized and evaluated for their spectral properties, singlet oxygen photogeneration, and inhibitory activity against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a representative enveloped virus. Incorporation of a thiophene moiety into the molecule significantly enhanced both the singlet oxygen generation ability and the antiviral activity. These findings provide useful insights into the relationship between the structure, spectral/photochemical properties, and biological activity of perylene&#8208;based photosensitizers.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the C&#8208;Glycosylated Depside Arenicolin B</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arenicolin B is a C&#8208;glucosylated depside assembled by a combination of highly&#8208;reducing (HRPKS) and non&#8208;reducing polyketide synthases (NRPKS) to afford the aglycone depside precursor. Depside bond formation is catalyzed by the NRPKS thioesterase (TE) domain. Tailoring by a C&#8208;glycosyltransferase selectively mono&#8208;glycosylates the depside to furnish arenicolin B.







Abstract
We uncovered the biosynthetic pathway of the C&#8208;glycosylated depside arenicolin B from Phialomyces arenicola through genome mining, heterologous reconstitution and biochemical characterization. The biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of arenicolin B is comprised of a HRPKS, a NRPKS, and a C&#8208;glycosyltransferase. Through biochemical dissection and evaluation, we demonstrate the NRPKS thioesterase (TE) domain catalyses depside formation.

         <title>Maintaining the Integral Membrane Proteome: Revisiting the Functional Repertoire of Integral Membrane Proteases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regulated intramembrane proteolysis is crucial for functional proteome in all kingdoms of life. The task of cleaving transmembrane proteins within the unique environment of the lipid bilayer presents biochemical challenges that has been solved by integral membrane proteases (IMPRs). This review explores the structural and functional characteristics of IMPRs while also discussing future directions in this exciting field of science.







Abstract
Cells in all kingdoms of life employ dedicated protein quality control machineries for both their cytosolic and membrane proteome ensuring cellular functionality. These crucial systems consist besides a large variety of molecular chaperones, ensuring a proper fold and consequently function of the client's proteome, of several proteases to clean out damaged, unfunctional and potentially toxic proteins. One of the key features underlying the functional cycle of these quality control systems is the inherent flexibility of their bound clients which for a long time impaired detailed structural characterization, with advanced high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy in the last decade playing a key role contributing to the present understanding of their functional properties. Although these studies laid the foundation of the present knowledge of the mechanistic details of the maintenance of cytosolic proteins, the understanding of related systems employed for membrane associated as well as integral membrane proteins remains rather sparse to date. Herein, we review the crucial contributions of structural and dynamical biology approaches, possessing the power to resolve both structure and dynamics of such systems as well as enabling the elucidation of the functional repertoire of multimeric proteases involved in maintaining a functional membrane proteome.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cells in all kingdoms of life employ dedicated protein quality control machineries for both their cytosolic and membrane proteome ensuring cellular functionality. These crucial systems consist besides a large variety of molecular chaperones, ensuring a proper fold and consequently function of the client's proteome, of several proteases to clean out damaged, unfunctional and potentially toxic proteins. One of the key features underlying the functional cycle of these quality control systems is the inherent flexibility of their bound clients which for a long time impaired detailed structural characterization, with advanced high-resolution NMR spectroscopy in the last decade playing a key role contributing to the present understanding of their functional properties. Although these studies laid the foundation of the present knowledge of the mechanistic details of the maintenance of cytosolic proteins, the understanding of related systems employed for membrane associated as well as integral membrane proteins remains rather sparse to date. Herein, we review the crucial contributions of structural and dynamical biology approaches, possessing the power to resolve both structure and dynamics of such systems as well as enabling the elucidation of the functional repertoire of multimeric proteases involved in maintaining a functional membrane proteome.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Viscoelastic Supramolecular Hydrogel Co&#8208;Assembled from Gatifloxacin and Deoxyguanosine for the Treatment of Bacterial Keratitis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 6, March 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The supramolecular D&#8208;Gat gel fabricated from antibiotics and nucleotides exhibits viscoelasticity and low cohesion, enabling uniform ocular coverage, rapid recovery, and minimal tissue adhesion. Compared to traditional ocular gels, it enhances therapeutic efficacy, prolongs retention, and improves bioavailability. Additionally, it offers simplified preparation, high transparency, and excellent biocompatibility, making it ideal for the treatment of ocular infections.







Abstract
Bacterial keratitis is the most prevalent ocular surface infection, causing significant inconvenience to patients&#8217; lives and posing a risk of blindness if mismanaged. The application of antibiotic gels has been a principal clinic therapeutic intervention due to the retarded ocular surface medication retention. However, current clinical gel formulations rely on high viscosity polymer matrices to improve retention, which often results in uneven gel layers, causing sticky sensation and prone to adhesion to periocular tissues during blinking, leading to clearance. In this study, we propose a supramolecular hydrogel assembled from antibiotic and natural nucleotide molecules with viscoelastic rheology and low cohesion texture. These features enabled it spread to uniformly on the ocular surface, recover deformation after blinking, and are less likely to adhere to periocular tissues, significantly improving drug retention on the ocular surface and achieving better therapeutic effects in the treatment of bacterial keratitis. Additionally, the hydrogel is easy to prepare, has good visibility and safety, offering a new strategy for the development of ophthalmic gels.

         <title>Identification and Characterization of a Novel d&#8208;Branched&#8208;Chain Amino Acids Importer from Lactobacillus fermentum</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 6, March 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Certain lactic acid bacteria produce d&#8208;branched&#8208;chain amino acids (d&#8208;BCAA) and encode isoleucine 2&#8208;epimerase (ILEP) and an uncharacterized transporter (AAP). We demonstrate that the transporter is a novel, non&#8208;stereospecific BCAA importer. The ILEP&#8208;AAP operon likely aids in storing and utilizing BCAA in a form less accessible to other organisms.







Abstract
Various lactic acid bacteria synthesize d&#8208;branched&#8208;chain amino acids (d&#8208;BCAA) during growth, but their physiological function remains largely elusive. The pyridoxal phosphate&#8208;dependent enzyme isoleucine 2&#8208;epimerase (ILEP) has been identified as the key enzyme responsible for d&#8208;BCAA biosynthesis. Comparative genomic analyses revealed that genes encoding ILEP and an uncharacterized amino acid&#8208;polyamine&#8208;organocation (APC) family transporter are adjacent in several d&#8208;BCAA&#8208;producing bacteria, suggesting a functional link between these two proteins in d&#8208;BCAA metabolism. In this study, we investigated the function of the APC family transporter from Lactobacillus fermentum (LfAAP). Using heterologous expression systems in Escherichia coli and Lactococcus lactis, we demonstrated that LfAAP functions as a non&#8208;stereospecific BCAA importer. Mutational analysis revealed that Ala119 and Met331 play critical roles in substrate recognition. Heterologous expression of LfAAP and/or LfILEP in a L. lactis strain, which lacks the ILEP&#8208;AAP genes operon, revealed that ILEP functions as both synthetic and catabolic enzyme for d&#8208;BCAA. Our findings suggest that the ILEP&#8208;AAP system contribute to storage and subsequent utilization of BCAA in a form that is less accessible by other organisms, providing a potential competitive advantage in microbial environments.

         <title>Modulating Enzyme Activity using Engineered Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 6, March 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomaterials offer a tunable platform for modulating enzyme activity. Based on their size, structure, and functionalization, they can inhibit or even enhance enzyme performance. Importantly, these effects can be reversible, enabling temporal control over enzyme function. This Concept highlights key advancements in this field and outlines areas in need of further development toward unlocking a broader range of applications.







Abstract
Enzymes serve as pivotal components in various biotechnological applications across several industries. Understanding enzyme inhibition sheds light on how certain compounds disrupt biochemical pathways, facilitating the design of targeted drugs for combating diseases. On the other hand, reversible inhibition or enhancement of activity can unlock new ways of controlling industrial reactions and boosting the catalytic activity of native enzymes that are taken out of their natural environments. Over the last two decades, immobilizing enzymes on nanomaterial&#8208;based solid supports has emerged as an especially promising approach for tuning enzyme activity. Nanomaterials not only inhibit enzymes but also enhance their performance, showcasing their versatility. This Concept highlights significant advancements in utilizing nanomaterials for enzyme modulation and discusses future prospects for leveraging this phenomenon in developing sophisticated molecular systems and downstream applications.

         <title>Target Identification of Marine Natural Product Odoamide:Odoamide Induces Apoptotic Cell Death by Targeting ATPase Na+/K+ Transporting Subunit Alpha 1 (ATP1A1)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 6, March 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Odoamide, a member of the aurilide&#8208;family, exhibits highly potent cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines. This study clarifies the target protein and MOA of odoamide by an affinity&#8208;based methodology, followed by analyses of the binding protein and odoamide&#8208;resistant cells. We discuss the impact of affinity&#8208;based target identification for natural products and the potential of odoamide for drug development.







Abstract
Marine natural products show a large variety of unique chemical structures and potent biological activities. Elucidating the target molecule and the mechanism of action is an essential and challenging step in drug development starting with a natural product. Odoamide, a member of aurilide&#8208;family isolated from Okinawan marine cyanobacterium, has been known to exhibit highly potent cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines. In this study, we investigated the target protein and the cytotoxic mechanism of odoamide. Compared to existing anticancer agents, odoamide showed a unique fingerprint in the JFCR39 cancer cell panel and a characteristic pattern in gene expression profiling. Affinity chromatography utilizing a biologically active odoamide probe identified ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit alpha 1 (ATP1A1) as a specific binding protein. Additionally, cells resistant to odoamide were found to have mutations at Gly98 and Gly99 of the ATP1A1 protein. The apparently attenuated cytotoxic and apoptotic activities of odoamide in odoamide&#8208;resistant cells suggests that the induction of these activities by odoamide is critically dependent on its interaction with ATP1A1. We conclude that odoamide induces apoptotic cell death by targeting ATP1A1, and we discuss the impact of affinity&#8208;based target identification for natural products and the potential of ATP1A1 inhibitors for drug discovery.

         <title>Designer Helical Fibers and Tubes: Self&#8208;assembling Hybrid Peptides via Leu/Ile&#8208;Phe Zipper</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 6, March 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of dipeptides with phenylene urea at their N&#8208;terminus exhibit tubular or fibrous assemblies, depending on the dipeptide sequence. Tubular structures are formed through an Ile/Leu&#8208;Phe zipper involving a double helical arrangement. The self&#8208;assembled structures also display autofluorescence and red&#8208;edge excitation behaviour.







Abstract
Here, we present a family of simple peptides that show diverse self&#8208;assembling behaviors. We used aliphatic (Leu/Ile) and aromatic (Phe) amino acids to delineate our design. The design consists of phenylene urea at the N&#8208;terminus of the peptide. The urea peptides with sequence Phe&#8208;LeuOMe (1) or Phe&#8208;IleOMe (2) associate to form polygonal peptide tubes via zipper arrangements, supported by microscopic and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. The peptide with Phe placed away from the phenylene urea (3 and 4), showed fibrous assembly. All the peptides showed autofluorescence and red edge excitation behavior upon self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>The Structural Permissiveness of Triosephosphate Isomerase (TpiA) of Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 6, March 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enzyme triosephosphate isomerase has a typical (&#946;&#945;)8&#8208;barrel superfold with eight &#946;&#945; units, linked together by loops which wrap around to form a cylinder of parallel &#946;&#8208;strands (&#946;&#8208;barrel) surrounded by a layer of parallel &#945;&#8208;helices. Such loops L1&#8211;L3 are candidates for insertion of extra amino acids, but genetic analyses shown in this work reveals permissiveness in other structured sites also.







Abstract
Triosephosphate isomerase (TpiA) is widely regarded as an example of an optimally evolved enzyme due to its essential role in biological systems, its structural conservation, and its near&#8208;perfect kinetic parameters. In this study, we investigated the structural robustness of the archetypal TpiA variant from Escherichia coli using an in&#8197;vitro 5&#8208;amino acid linker scanning method. The resulting library was introduced into a tpiA mutant strain for functional complementation. From this library, 16 TpiA variants that were phenotypically indistinguishable from the wild&#8208;type enzyme were selected for further analysis. Although all variants retained enzymatic activities within the wild&#8208;type range, several insertions were found in highly structured protein domains where the linker was expected to cause significant structural perturbations. Despite these potentially disruptive additions, the enzymes maintained their activity even when expressed in a dnaK mutant, suggesting that chaperones did not compensate for structural abnormalities in&#8197;vivo. Additionally, when these mutant TpiA variants were produced using an in&#8197;vitro transcription/translation system, they exhibited enzymatic activity comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of the non&#8208;mutated enzyme. AlphaFold2 exposed that insertions reconstructed the local architecture of the nearby amino acid sequences. The evolutionary implications of this remarkable structural resilience are discussed.

         <title>A Facile Label&#8208;Free Colorimetric Assay for DNase I Activity Based on the Peroxidase&#8208;Like Activity of Functional Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 6, March 15, 2025. </description>

A colorimetric assay for DNase I detection based functional nucleic acids with peroxidase&#8208;like activity.







Abstract
DNase I plays a crucial role in fundamental biological processes, including gene expression, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Therefore, it is important to develop a simple and efficient method to detect DNase I activity. In this work, a colorimetric assay based on functional nucleic acid for sensitive DNase I detection was reported. The functional nucleic acids with G&#8208;rich bases exhibit peroxidase&#8208;like activity under acetic acid conditions, capable of catalyzing the oxidation of chromogenic substrate 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). The specific nucleic acid is designed as the substrate for DNase I, which can hydrolyze the strand and reduce the catalytic activity of the reaction system. Based on this, a sensitive, simple, efficient, and cost&#8208;effective colorimetric detection platform was constructed for the quantitative analysis of DNase I. The detection limit (3&#963;/s) for DNase I was 0.046&#8197;U/mL with a linear range of 0.1&#8211;1&#8197;U/mL. Moreover, the practicality of this colorimetric detection platform was demonstrated by detecting DNase I in human serum.

         <title>Proteome&#8208;Wide Profiling of Olaparib Interactors Using a Biotinylated Photoaffinity Probe</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 6, March 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel interactors found for olaparib: Olaparib is an important anti&#8208;cancer drug in BRCA&#8208;mutated cancers. In this study, we identified novel interactors for olaparib using photoaffinity labeling. We designed a biotinylated photoaffinity probe and used it in a proteomic screening to discover a broad range of olaparib interactors, including previously unreported proteins, contributing to the current understanding of olaparib&#8216;s pharmacology.







Abstract
Olaparib is a widely used PARP inhibitor for the treatment of BRCA&#8208;mutated cancers. To comprehensively understand the drug&#8216;s clinical impact, measuring its interactions with intended on&#8208; and off&#8208;targets is crucial. In this study, olaparib&#8216;s on&#8208; and off&#8208;targets were profiled using photoaffinity labeling, a powerful, proteome&#8208;wide method for studying the direct interactions between a drug and its protein targets. A novel photoaffinity probe was designed and used in a proteomic screening to discover novel targets of olaparib in the human proteome. The probe, incorporating a pre&#8208;installed biotin group, bypasses the limitations of using a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed click reaction in cell lysates for reporter group conjugation and revealed a broad range of olaparib interactors, including previously unreported proteins, in a quantitative mass spectrometry&#8208;based proteomic screening using HeLa whole cell lysate. This study contributes to our current understanding of the pharmacology of olaparib and provides a valuable tool for elucidating drug interactors within cell lysates, potentially guiding the development of more targeted therapeutics with fewer off&#8208;targets.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Neoplastic Gallium&#8208;Based PROTAC for PDI Degradation Triggers Autophagy and Immunogenic Cell Death</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 6, March 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gallium (III)&#8208;based PROTACs facilitate the formation of a ternary complex between the target protein (PDI), the PROTAC, and an E3/E2 ligase, ultimately leading to the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the target protein by the proteasome. This, in turn, can trigger the autophagy of cells and immunogenic cell death.







Abstract
Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), a family of thiol&#8208;disulfide oxidoreductases, is one of the most abundant soluble proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is responsible for protein folding. Increasing evidence suggests that PDI is overexpressed in multiple types of cancer, positioning it as a promising target for tumor therapy. We have designed and synthesized a series of gallium complex&#8208;based proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which exhibited effective targeting and degradation of PDI in&#8197;vitro. After analyzing the relationship between structure and function, we have identified M&#8208;2 as the compound that most efficiently degrades PDI. Our research shows that M&#8208;2&#8208;induced degradation of PDI can trigger the unfolded protein response, leading to cell autophagy and initiating immunogenic cell death (ICD), as demonstrated in mouse models. This study suggests a potential opportunity for combining PDI targeting and immunotherapy.

         <title>Ratiometric Fluorescent Probe for Sensitive Tracking of Peroxynitrite during Drug&#8208;Induced Hepatotoxicity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 6, March 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ratiometric fluorescent probe, PFVEI, has been rationally designed for the detection of ONOO&#8722;. This probe incorporates indole salt, furan ring, and benzene ring structures, exhibiting a rapid reaction rate, high sensitivity, and excellent stability towards ONOO&#8722;. Furthermore, PFVEI has been successfully employed to track endogenous ONOO&#8722; and to visualize the concentration changes of ONOO&#8722; during hepatotoxicity.







Abstract
As an essential component of reactive oxygen species (ROS), peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;) plays an indispensable role in redox homeostasis and signal transduction, with anomalous levels implicated in various clinical conditions. Therefore, accurate and rapid detection of intracellular ONOO&#8722; levels is crucial for revealing its role in physiological and pathological processes. In this study, we developed a ratiometric fluorescent probe to detect ONOO&#8722; levels in biological systems. The probe demonstrated a fast reaction rate (within 15&#8197;min), outstanding selectivity, high sensitivity (limit of detection=13.32&#8197;nM), and stability in the presence of ONOO&#8722;. The proposed probe was successfully used for visualizing endogenous ONOO&#8722; in living cells and tracking changes in intracellular ONOO&#8722; levels during drug&#8208;induced hepatotoxicity using ratiometric fluorescence.

         <title>Chondroitin Sulfate&#8208;Coated Heteroduplex&#8208;Molecular Spherical Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 6, March 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
[60]fullerene&#8208;based molecular spherical nucleic acids (MSNAs) were used as hybridization&#8208;mediated carriers for an antisense oligonucleotide, suppressing Tau protein, and its conjugates with chondroitin sulfate (CS) tetrasaccharides. The impact of the MSNA&#8208;carriers and the CS&#8208;halo on the cellular uptake and suppression of Tau&#8208;protein was studied with hippocampal neurons in&#8197;vitro.







Abstract
Molecular Spherical Nucleic Acids (MSNAs) are atomically uniform dendritic nanostructures and potential delivery vehicles for oligonucleotides. The radial formulation combined with covalent conjugation may hide the oligonucleotide content and simultaneously enhance the role of appropriate conjugate groups on the outer sphere. The conjugate halo may be modulated to affect the delivery properties of the MSNAs. In the present study, [60]fullerene&#8208;based molecular spherical nucleic acids, consisting of a 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleotide and a ribonucleotide sequence, were used as hybridization&#8208;mediated carriers (&#8220;DNA and RNA&#8208;carriers&#8221;) for an antisense oligonucleotide, suppressing Tau protein, (i.&#8201;e. Tau&#8208;ASO) and its conjugates with chondroitin sulfate tetrasaccharides (CS) with different sulfation patterns. The impact of the MSNA carriers, CS&#8208;moieties on the conjugates and the CS&#8208;decorations on the MSNAs on cellular uptake and &#8208; activity (Tau&#8208;suppression) of the Tau&#8208;ASO was studied with hippocampal neurons in&#8197;vitro. The formation and stability of these heteroduplex ASO&#8208;MSNAs were evaluated by UV melting profile analysis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and size exclusion chromatography equipped with a multi angle light scattering detector (SEC&#8208;MALS). The cellular uptake and &#8208; activity were studied by confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis, respectively.

         <title>Synthesis and Preliminary Evaluation of Tanshinone Mimic Conjugates for Mechanism of Action Studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 6, March 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small array of Tanshinone Mimics (TM) probes with a detection&#8208;promoting moiety (either a photoaffinity probe &#8208; PAP or biotin) has been synthesized for mechanism of action (MoA) studies on Human antigen R (HuR). Biological and biochemical assays were used to characterize the novel TM conjugates. Among these, biotinylated probe 5&#8201;a proved to be the most promising compound.







Abstract
Human antigen R (HuR) is an RNA binding protein (RBP) belonging to the ELAV (Embryonic Lethal Abnormal Vision) family, which stabilizes mRNAs and regulates the expression of multiple genes. Its altered expression or localization is related to pathological features such as cancer or inflammation. Dihydrotanshinone I (DHTS I) is a naturally occurring, tetracyclic ortho&#8208;quinone inhibitor of the HuR&#8208;mRNA interaction. Our earlier efforts led to the identification of a synthetic Tanshinone Mimic (TM) 2 with improved affinity for HuR. Here we report five new TM probes 3&#8211;5 bearing a detection&#8208;promoting moiety (either photo affinity probe &#8208; PAP or biotin) as a para&#8208;substituent on the phenyl&#8208;sulphonamide for mechanism of action (MoA) studies. Biological and biochemical assays were used to characterize the novel TM conjugates 3&#8211;5. They showed similar toxic activity in HuR&#8208;expressing triple&#8208;negative breast cancer MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells, with micromolar CC50s. REMSAs revealed that photoactivatable groups (4&#8201;a and 4&#8201;b), but not biotin (5&#8201;a and 5&#8201;b), prevented conjugates&#8217; ability to disrupt rHuR&#8208;RNA complexes. Further biochemical studies confirmed that biotinylated probes, in particular 5&#8201;a, can be used to isolate rM1&#8197;M2 from solutions, taking advantage of streptavidin&#8208;coated magnetic beads, thus being the most promising HuR inhibitor to be used for further MoA studies in cell lysates.

         <title>Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Temozolomide Probe for Overcoming MGMT&#8208;Mediated Resistance in Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 6, March 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mitochondria&#8208;targeted temozolomide (mtTmz) using peptide&#8208;based delivery vector has been shown to overcome direct DNA repair and resistance by O6&#8208;methylgunaine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) in glioblastoma (GBM) cells. This has been demonstrated through viability assays using MGMT&#8208;positive and negative cell lines, and the effect of mtTmz on MGMT subcellular localization and expression was analysed using Proteinase K digestion assays and RT&#8208;qPCR, respectively.







Abstract
Temozolomide (Tmz) is a DNA methylating agent used for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Resistance to Tmz in GBM is caused by the DNA direct repair enzyme O6&#8208;methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), which is expressed in ~50&#8201;% of GBM tumours. It has yet to be confirmed that MGMT acts within mitochondria to repair mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and in this report we discuss the development of a novel mitochondria&#8208;targeted temozolomide probe (mtTmz) for evading MGMT&#8208;mediated resistance. Through conjugation of Tmz to a mitochondria&#8208;penetrating peptide (MPP), exclusive mitochondrial localization was achieved, and the probe retained alkylation activity demonstrated by chemical and DNA&#8208;based assays. Absence of nuclear DNA damage was assessed by detecting &#947;H2AX foci. mtTmz demonstrated efficient cell killing capabilities independent of MGMT status in GBM cells as determined by cell viability assays. It was determined using a Proteinase K digestion assay that MGMT does not translocate to mitochondria in response to mtTmz treatment, and RT&#8208;qPCR analysis demonstrated that mtTmz does not induce MGMT gene expression compared to Tmz. The results reported highlight both the potential of mitochondrial targeting of Tmz and mitochondria as a therapeutic target in MGMT&#8208;expressing GBM.

Benzoselenazoles carrying an anilide group in a very close proximity to the Se atom are found to be very good radical&#8208;trapping as well as hydroperoxide&#8208;decomposing antioxidants. They also exhibited the antimicrobial activity against B. subtilis and P. aeruginosa with minimum inhibitory concentration.







Abstract
The synthesis of phenolic benzoselenazoles has been described. These were synthesized from their corresponding diselenides and aldehydes using acetic acid as a catalyst. All compounds have been tested for glutathione peroxidase (GPx)&#8208;like antioxidant activity in thiophenol assay. Radical&#8208;trapping antioxidant (RTA) activity of benzoselenazoles towards ROO&#8901; radicals has been studied for the inhibition of autoxidation of cumene in chlorobenzene from the O2&#8208;consumption during the inhibited period. Compound 13&#8201;c was found to inhibit azo&#8208;initiated oxidation of cumene with a stoichiometric factor (n) &#8771;2.2. This study also suggested some insights into the substitution&#8208;dependent activity of anilides over phenols as effective radical&#8208;trapping antioxidants. Moreover, the zone of inhibition study corroborated the antimicrobial potential of benzoselenazole antioxidants against Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). Anti&#8208;biofilm activities were portrayed against the production of biofilms by B. subtilis and P. aeruginosa. MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231&#8197;cell line was selected for triple&#8208;negative breast carcinoma for in&#8197;vitro cytotoxicity of all antioxidants using the MTT assay. Additionally, the interaction patterns of antioxidants with target proteins of B. subtilis and P. aeruginosa were demonstrated using molecular docking study. Molecular dynamics simulations were deployed to investigate the structural dynamics and the stability of the complex.

         <title>Click Hydrogels to Assess Stiffness&#8208;Induced Activation of Pancreatic Cancer&#8208;Associated Fibroblasts and Its Impact on Cancer Cell Spreading</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 6, March 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a norbornene&#8208;based click hydrogel system with independently tunable stiffness and cell adhesive ligand to evaluate stiffness&#8208;induced activation of pancreatic cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAF) and migration of pancreatic cancer cells (PCC). Results show that substrate stiffness affects the nuclear localization dynamics of Yes&#8208;associated protein and verify the role of CAFs in promoting PCC migration under an elevated substrate stiffness.







Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is marked by significant desmoplastic reactions, or the accumulation of excessive extracellular matrices. PDAC stroma has abnormally high stiffness, which alters cancer cell behaviors and creates a barrier for effective drug delivery. Unfortunately, clinical trials using a combination of chemotherapy and matrix&#8208;degrading enzyme have led to disappointing results, as the degradation of stromal tissue likely accelerated the dissemination of cancer cells. High matrix stiffness has been shown to activate cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs), increasing their interaction with pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs) through promoting proliferation, migration, and resistance to chemotherapy. With the advance of biomaterials science and engineering, it is now possible to design chemically defined matrices to understand the role of stiffness in activating pancreatic CAFs and how this may alter cancer cell migration. Here, we developed a norbornene&#8208;based click hydrogel system with independently tunable stiffness and cell adhesive ligand to evaluate stiffness&#8208;induced activation of CAFs and migration of PCCs. Our results show that matrix stiffness did not alter matrix deposition from CAFs but affected nuclear localization of Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP). Our results also verify the role of CAFs on promoting PCC migration and an elevated substrate stiffness further increased PCC motility.

         <title>Impact of DNA Nick on the Self&#8208;Assembly of Single&#8208;Tile&#8208;Based Polyhedra</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 6, March 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of DNA nick on the tile&#8208;based assembly of three&#8208;dimensional wireframe polyhedra is systematically investigated. Interestingly, the tile concentration and the valence of metal cations play significant roles in how DNA nick influences the self&#8208;assembly of DNA tiles. Besides, there is a threshold percentage of intact tiles above which the nick would not have obvious impact.







Abstract
Tile&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly is a simple yet highly efficient bottom&#8208;up nanofabrication strategy, which has been widely applied in many fields such as structural DNA nanotechnology. The self&#8208;assembly of DNA tile is determined by not only the sequence design, but also the existing nick in the tile, as it would influence the flexibility and the symmetry of the tile. Herein, we systematically investigated the impact of nick on the tile&#8208;based assembly of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) DNA polyhedra in various conditions. A series of tile concentrations, four different sticky ends, two annealing approaches, buffers with different metal cations, and different molar percentages of intact tiles, were all tested. It was found that the tile concentration and the valence of metal cations played significant roles in how DNA nick influenced the assembly of DNA polyhedra. Besides, when the molar percentage of intact tiles was higher than the threshold of about two&#8208;thirds, the impact of nick on the assembly of DNA polyhedra would not be obvious. Our work provides an insightful understanding of the role of nick in the fabrication of high&#8208;quality structures from single&#8208;tile&#8208;based assembly.

         <title>4&#8208;O&#8208;Methylglucaric Acid Production from Xylan with Uronic Acid Oxidase and Comparison to Glucaric Acid from Glucose</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 6, March 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beechwood glucuronoxylan was enzymatically hydrolyzed and the resulting 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucuronic acid was oxidized to 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid by uronic acid oxidase with a yield of 95&#8201;%. High purity (98&#8201;% w/w) 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid was isolated from the reaction mixture and was demonstrated to perform similarly to commercial glucaric acid in detergent builder applications.







Abstract
This study describes an enzymatic pathway to produce high purity 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid from xylan, an underutilized fraction of lignocellulosic biomass. Beechwood xylan was enzymatically hydrolysed using a commercial xylanase and an &#945;&#8208;glucuronidase from Amphibacillus xylanus to form 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucuronic acid, which was then purified by anion exchange chromatography and subsequently oxidized to 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid using a recombinantly produced uronic acid oxidase from Citrus sinensis. Enzymatic oxidation with uronic acid oxidase afforded 95&#8201;% yield in 72&#8197;hours which is considerably higher than yields previously achieved using a glucooligosaccharide oxidase from Sarocladium strictum. 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid was isolated by precipitation and purified by recrystallization. Characterization by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirmed product identity and high purity (97.8&#8201;% w/w). 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid's performance as a detergent builder was compared to commercial glucaric acid. At 10&#8201;:&#8201;1 molar ratios of detergent builder to calcium, 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid provided similar calcium sequestration performance to glucaric acid (less than 5&#8201;% difference) at pH&#8197;7 and pH&#8197;10 in the presence of surfactants, including sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate. Given their similar calcium sequestration performance, 4&#8208;O&#8208;methylglucaric acid could effectively substitute for glucaric acid in detergent formulations.

         <title>Self&#8208;Immobilizing Fluorogenic Probe for In Situ Labeling of Granzyme B Activity in Host Immune Response to Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 6, March 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed and synthesized three granzyme B&#8208;activated near&#8208;infrared molecular probes. Among them, the probe HCy&#8208;F exhibits in&#8197;situ imaging capabilities, enabling precise quantification of GzmB activity. This advancement provides a valuable tool for monitoring immune responses and optimizing immunotherapy approaches for combating drug&#8208;resistant pathogens.







Abstract
Bacterial infections, particularly those caused by drug&#8208;resistant bacteria, represent a pressing global health challenge. During the interaction between pathogen infection and host defense, bacterial infections initiate the host's immune response, which involves the activation of proteases that play a critical role in antibacterial defense. Granzyme B (GzmB), a key immune&#8208;related biomarker associated with cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), plays a pivotal role in this process. Therefore, detecting the activity of GzmB is crucial for understanding the host immune response to bacterial infections and for developing therapeutic strategies to overcome bacterial virulence. In this study, we designed and synthesized three granzyme B&#8208;activated near&#8208;infrared molecular probes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacterial infections, particularly those caused by drug-resistant bacteria, represent a pressing global health challenge. During the interaction between pathogen infection and host defense, bacterial infections initiate the host's immune response, which involves the activation of proteases that play a critical role in antibacterial defense. Granzyme B (GzmB), a key immune-related biomarker associated with cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), plays a pivotal role in this process. Therefore, detecting the activity of GzmB is crucial for understanding the host immune response to bacterial infections and for developing therapeutic strategies to overcome bacterial virulence. In this study, we designed and synthesized three granzyme B-activated near-infrared molecular probes. Among them, the probe &lt;b&gt;HCy-F&lt;/b&gt; demonstrates &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; imaging capability, enabling precise quantification of GzmB activity. This development offers a valuable tool for monitoring immune responses and optimizing immunotherapy approaches for combating drug-resistant pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interplay between C&#945; Methylation and C&#945; Stereochemistry in the Folding Energetics of a Helix&#8208;Rich Miniprotein</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 6, March 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comparison of the achiral residue 2&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) and chiral &#945;&#8208;methylated analogues as modifications in a helix&#8208;rich miniprotein reveals a synergistic thermodynamic benefit from C&#945; methylation in conjunction with a C&#945; stereocenter. These results help inform the use of these monomers in design of helical peptide mimetics and yield new fundamental insights into consequences of backbone methylation on folding.







Abstract
The &#945;&#8208;helix is an abundant and functionally important element of protein secondary structure, which has motivated intensive efforts toward chemical strategies to stabilize helical folds. One such method is the incorporation of non&#8208;canonical backbone composition through an additional methyl substituent at the C&#945; atom. Examples of monomers include the achiral 2&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) with geminal dimethyl substitution and chiral analogues with one methyl and one non&#8208;methyl substituent. While Aib and chiral C&#945;&#8208;Me residues are both established helix promoting moieties, their comparative ability in this regard has not been quantitatively investigated. Addressing this gap would help to inform the use of these building blocks in the construction of peptide and protein mimetics as well as provide fundamental insights into consequences of backbone methylation on folding. Here, we report a quantitative comparison of the impacts of Aib and chiral &#945;Me residues on the high&#8208;resolution folded structure and folding thermodynamics of a small helical protein. These results reveal a synergistic stabilizing effect arising from the presence of C&#945; methylation in conjunction with a C&#945; stereocenter.

         <title>Expanding the Enzymatic Toolbox for Carboligation: Increasing the Diversity of the &#8216;Split&#8217; Transketolase Sequence Space</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 6, March 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several putative split transketolases were retrieved via (meta)genome mining, increasing our understanding of this type of prokaryotic TK, whose domains are located on two separate subunits. Ten split TKs were purified and tested for erythrulose production, with the best&#8208;performing enzyme kinetically characterized. Evaluation of their thermostability led to the identification of promising candidates for potential use in biocatalysis.







Abstract
Transketolases (TKs) are thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)&#8208;dependent enzymes that catalyze the transfer of two&#8208;carbon units in a stereoselective manner, making them valuable biocatalysts for sustainable processes. Most known TKs are about 650 amino acids long; however, a second type found in Archaea and many Bacteria consists of two proteins, each of about 300 amino acids. Exploring the unique features and differences of split TKs may help in assessing their potential use in biocatalysis and for uncovering new reactivities. Additionally, it could provide valuable information on how their structure relates to their function, especially compared to full&#8208;length TKs. In this study, we significantly expanded the known repertoire of split TKs approximately 14&#8208;fold to the best of our knowledge, by identifying and providing accessions of nearly 500 putative split&#8208;TK subunit pairs. Moreover, we doubled the number of experimentally produced and tested split TKs by cloning, purifying, and testing ten candidates retrieved from genomes and in&#8208;house metagenomes. Interestingly, pQR2809 and pQR2812, derived from hyperthermophilic organisms, showed enhanced thermostability compared to other TK examples in the literature, maintaining partial activity after heating at 90&#8201;&#176;C or 100&#8201;&#176;C for 1&#8197;hour, respectively.

         <title>A Practical Approach for Polarity and Quantity Controlled Assembly of Membrane Proteins into Nanoliposomes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 6, March 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA origami was used as the internal skeleton of the liposomes to control the number and polarity of the modular adaptor&#8208;fused OmpF assembly in the membrane to achieve pH&#8208;responsive and size&#8208;selective permeability. This approach offers the potential to construct artificial compartments containing membrane proteins of defined number and polarity, allowing tunable substrate fluxes.







Abstract
Biological membranes achieve selectivity and permeability through protein transporters and channels. The design of artificial compartments with permeable membranes is essential to facilitate substrate and product transfer in enzymatic reactions. In this study, an E. coli outer membrane protein OmpF fused to a modular adaptor was integrated onto a DNA origami skeleton to control the number and polarity of the OmpF trimer. DNA origami skeleton&#8208;guided nanoliposomes reconstituted with functional OmpF exhibit pH&#8208;responsiveness and size&#8208;selective permeability. This approach highlights the potential to construct artificial compartments that incorporate membrane proteins of defined number and polarity, allowing tunable substrate fluxes.

         <title>Development of a Highly Selective NanoBRET Probe to Assess MAGL Inhibition in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 6, March 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new intracellular NanoBRET assay was developed to assess MAGL inhibition in live cells. To this end, a potent reversible preclinical inhibitor was linked to the cell&#8208;permeable BODIPY590 fluorophore by means of structure&#8208;based design, and MAGL was engineered with a fused nanoluciferase (Nluc) protein as a suitable donor counterpart. The assay was validated using representative irreversible and reversible MAGL inhibitors, followed by profiling of over 1&#8217;900 project compounds. This study demonstrates the advantages of cell&#8208;based assays in accelerating compound profiling in early project stages.







Abstract
Cell&#8208;free enzymatic assays are highly useful tools in early compound profiling due to their robustness and scalability. However, their inadequacy to reflect the complexity of target engagement in a cellular environment may lead to a significantly divergent pharmacology that is eventually observed in cells. The discrepancy that emerges from properties like permeability and unspecific protein binding may largely mislead lead compound selection to undergo further chemical optimization. We report the development of a new intracellular NanoBRET assay to assess MAGL inhibition in live cells. Based on a reverse design approach, a highly potent, reversible preclinical inhibitor was conjugated to the cell&#8208;permeable BODIPY590 acceptor fluorophore while retaining its overall balanced properties. An engineered MAGL&#8208;nanoluciferase (Nluc) fusion protein provided a suitable donor counterpart for the facile interrogation of intracellular ligand activity. Validation of assay conditions using a selection of known MAGL inhibitors set the stage for the evaluation of over 1&#8217;900 MAGL drug candidates derived from our discovery program. This evaluation enabled us to select compounds for further development based not only on target engagement, but also on favorable physicochemical parameters like permeability and protein binding. This study highlights the advantages of cell&#8208;based target engagement assays for accelerating compound profiling and progress at the early stages of drug discovery programs.

         <title>Probing DNA G&#8208;Quadruplex and I&#8208;Motif Structures Via a Fluorescent Nucleoside Analogue: 4&#8208;Cyanoindole&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;Deoxyribonucleoside</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 6, March 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
It was demonstrated that the nucleoside analogue, 4&#8208;cyanoindole&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside (4CNI&#8208;NS), can serve as a minimally&#8208;perturbing and sensitive fluorescent probe of DNA structure and dynamics. In particular, the fluorescence intensity and decay kinetics of 4CNI&#8208;NS can be used to distinguish different noncanonical DNA structures, such as G&#8208;quadruplexes (GQs) and i&#8208;motifs (iMs), as well as to monitor the corresponding conformational transitions.







Abstract
Since the building blocks of DNA are nonfluorescent, various external fluorescence reporters have been employed to investigate the structure, dynamics, and function of DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (GQs) and i&#8208;motifs (iMs), which play an important role in gene regulation and expression. However, most of those fluorescence reporters lack the ability to provide site&#8208;specific structural information of interest. Therefore, it is necessary to develop fluorescent nucleoside analogues that can be covalently inserted into oligonucleotides, which not only serve this purpose, but minimize any potential perturbation towards the native structure of the DNA systems in question. Herein, we characterize the spectroscopic utility of a high quantum yield fluorescent nucleoside analogue, 4&#8208;cyanoindole&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside (4CNI&#8208;NS). We show that (1) incorporation of 4CNI&#8208;NS into various oligonucleotides does not alter their ability to fold into their respective native structures, nor does it affect the overall stability of those structures and (2) the fluorescence property of 4CNI&#8208;NS is sensitive to its local environment, and the fluorescence intensity and decay kinetics of the 4CNI&#8208;NS&#8208;containing oligonucleotides exhibit a clear dependence on their secondary structure formation. Collectively, our results demonstrate that 4CNI&#8208;NS can be used as a sensitive, isomorphic probe in the study of noncanonical DNA structures.

         <title>Development of a Highly Selective NanoBRET Probe to Assess MAGL Inhibition in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 6, March 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient intracellular NanoBRET assay for assessing MAGL target engagement in live cells was developed through an academia&#8208;industry collaboration. The cover showcases the automated assay and resulting cellular dose&#8208;dependent MAGL inhibition curves. Key to this was the design of a potent, cell&#8208;permeable 15&#8208;BODIPY probe, which is shown docked in the binding pocket of MAGL alongside the engineered MAGL&#8208;nanoluciferase (Nluc) fusion protein. This assay enabled rapid and reliable interrogation of over 1900 MAGL drug candidates. More details can be found in article 10.1002/cbic.202400704 by Uwe Grether, Marc Nazar&#233;, and co&#8208;workers.

Odoamide, a member of aurilide&#8208;family, exhibits highly potent cytotoxicity against cancer cells lines. The background scenery is Odohama Beach in Okinawa, Japan, where odoamide was isolated. Three key points are shown above: affinity&#8208;based target identification, the target protein, and phenotype of cytotoxicity. These findings will provide target identification technologies and critical information on the subsequent mechanistic analysis as well, which has been under discussion for years. More details can be found in article 10.1002/cbic.202400762 by Ryosuke Katsumata, Hiroshi Kamiyama, Yasutaka Takase, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Towards Next Generation Protein Sequencing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 6, March 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein sequencing is essential for understanding protein structure and function. Recently, nanopore protein sequencing has rapidly emerged as a research hotspot, offering single&#8208;molecule&#8208;level detection accuracy. It also shows great potential to become the mainstream method for next&#8208;generation protein sequencing.







Abstract
Understanding the structure and function of proteins is a critical objective in the life sciences. Protein sequencing, a central aspect of this endeavor, was first accomplished through Edman degradation in the 1950s.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 6, March 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the role of nucleic acid drugs (NADs) in optimizing radiotherapy. It outlines the primary classifications and mechanisms of radiotherapy, as well as the functional categories and applications of NADs. The synergistic effects of NADs and radiotherapy, along with their underlying mechanisms, are also discussed. Overall, NADs present a promising strategy for improving patient outcomes in cancer radiotherapy.







Abstract
Radiotherapy remains a cornerstone of cancer treatment, using high&#8208;energy radiation to induce DNA damage in tumor cells, leading to cell death. However, its efficacy is often hindered by challenges such as radiation resistance and side effects. As a powerful class of functional molecules, nucleic acid drugs (NADs) present a promising solution to these limitations. Engineered to target key pathways like DNA repair and tumor hypoxia, NADs can enhance radiotherapy sensitivity. NADs can also serve as delivery vehicles for radiotherapy agents such as radionuclides, improving targeting accuracy and minimizing side effects. This review explores the role of NADs in optimizing radiotherapy, highlighting their mechanisms, clinical applications, and synergies with radiotherapy, ultimately offering a promising strategy for improving patient outcomes in cancer therapy.

         <title>Probing Biomolecular Interactions with Paramagnetic Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 6, March 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paramagnetic NMR spectroscopy offers useful opportunities for structural biology. Key techniques such as pseudocontact shifts and paramagnetic relaxation enhancements provide long&#8208;range structural restraints, while dynamic nuclear polarization can amplify NMR signals of large biomolecules in complex environments. The integration of paramagnetic NMR data with computational methods like AlphaFold holds great potential to elucidate large and dynamic biomolecular complexes.







Abstract
Recent advances in computational methods like AlphaFold have transformed structural biology, enabling accurate modeling of protein complexes and driving applications in drug discovery and protein engineering. However, predicting the structure of systems involving weak, transient, or dynamic interactions, or of complexes with disordered regions, remains challenging. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy offers atomic&#8208;level insights into biomolecular complexes, even in weakly interacting and dynamic systems. Paramagnetic NMR, in particular, provides long&#8208;range structural restraints, easily exceeding distances over 25&#8197;&#197;, making it ideal for studying large protein complexes. Advances in chemical tools for introducing paramagnetic tags into proteins, combined with progress in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, have enhanced the method's utility. This perspective article discusses paramagnetic NMR approaches for analyzing biomolecular complexes in solution and in the solid state, emphasizing quantities like pseudocontact shifts, residual dipolar couplings, and paramagnetic relaxation enhancements. Additionally, dynamic nuclear polarization offers a promising method to amplify NMR signals of large complexes, even in complex environments. The integration of AlphaFold protein structure prediction with paramagnetic NMR holds great potential for advancing our understanding of biomolecular interactions.

         <title>Interactive 3D Objects Enhance Scientific Communication of Structural Data</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 6, March 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this perspective, the enhancement of scientific communication through interactive 3D models is presented. In contrast to 2D figures, the use of augmented reality and GLTF files can provide readers with a more comprehensive perception of structural data, preserving the three&#8208;dimensional complexity of published structures. This method has the potential to have a transformative effect on the authors&#8217; efforts to present complex data and improve readers comprehension of molecular interactions at the same time.







Abstract
In scientific communication about three&#8208;dimensional structures, creating two&#8208;dimensional representations is standard practice. These representations often suffer from the drawback of losing potential information due to dimensionality reduction. Several options exist to present, share and publish 3D figures, however based on recent publications they are not widely utilized. Here we present simple ways to preserve the three&#8208;dimensionality of the structure by the creation of a custom&#8208;made model in GLTF format that is generated in the same workflow as the conventional figures. They can be published alongside a given manuscript with minimal additional effort to the authors, but a huge impact on the communicative power of the manuscript concerning the three&#8208;dimensional features of the reported structures. The scripts we adapted and published for this purpose open up new possibilities for the illustrator and allow the viewer to access the full three&#8208;dimensionality of the published structure. In future, this can simplify the publication process of protein structures or other models and be a valuable tool for scientific communication in digital or printed form.

         <title>Genetically Encoded Fluorescent and Bioluminescent Probes for HDAC8</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Existing genetically encoded probes for protein deacetylases exhibit excellent sensitivity to NAD+&#8208;dependent sirtuins but lack responsiveness to Zn2+&#8208;dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs). Herein, we reformed the probe design by utilizing trifluoroacetyl lysine (TfAcK) instead and developed probes that could respond specifically to HDAC8 experimentally and promisingly other HDACs.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;based probes constructed via genetically encoding acetyl lysine (AcK) or its close analogs represent an important way to detect protein lysine deacetylases. Existing reported probes exhibit excellent sensitivity to NAD+&#8208;dependent sirtuins but lack responsiveness to Zn2+&#8208;dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs). Herein, we reformed the probe design by replacing the genetically encoded AcK with trifluoroacetyl lysine (TfAcK) and generated fluorescent and bioluminescent probes that could respond specifically to HDAC8 recombinantly expressed in E. coli and to endogenous HDACs in mammalian cells. We believe these probes would benefit the biological investigation of HDAC8 and promisingly some other HDACs, as well as the discovery of innovative HDAC inhibitors.

         <title>Recent Chemical Biology Insights Towards Reversible Stapled Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible stapled peptides have greatly expanded the chemical space of peptide stapling methods. They retain the advantages of stapled peptides while allowing controlled release of peptide molecules and other cargoes, broadening the application of peptides in chemical biology research, drug discovery and delivery.







Abstract
Peptides are increasingly recognized for their advantages over small molecules in the modulation of protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs), particularly in terms of potency and selectivity. &#8220;Staples&#8221; can be coupled to the amino acid residues of linear peptides to limit their conformation, improving the stability, membrane permeability, and resistance to proteolysis of peptides. However, the addition of staples can sometimes lead to the complete inactivation of the original peptide or result in extensive interactions that complicate biophysical analysis. Reversible stapled peptides provide an excellent solution to these issues. Besides, probes based on reversible stapled peptides are also indispensable tools for thoroughly investigating PPIs. Consequently, the development of diverse reversible stapling techniques for stapled peptides is crucial for broadening the applications of peptide molecules in drug discovery, drug delivery, and as tools in chemical biology research. This review aims to summarize representative chemical design strategies for reversible stapled peptides, focusing on reversible chemical stapling methods involving sulfhydryl, amino, and methylthio groups, as well as reversible modulation of the conformational states of stapled peptides. Additionally, we demonstrate some intriguing biological applications of stapled peptides and, finally, suggest future research directions in the field that will serve as references for related researchers.

         <title>Concept and Development of Metal&#8208;Framework Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
mFNA, a novel nanomaterial that combines the self&#8208;assembly precision of FNAs with the stability of metal nanomaterials, hold great potential in fields such as biomedicine, chemical sensing, materials science, and energy conversion. This article is the first to define &#8220;metal&#8208;framework nucleic acids,&#8221; exploring their construction methods and functional characteristics, while also providing a forward&#8208;looking analysis of research challenges and future trends, offering readers a comprehensive perspective on this field.







Abstract
Based on the Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing principle, precisely programmable metal&#8208;framework nucleic acids (mFNA) have evolved from one&#8208;dimensional to three&#8208;dimensional nanoscale structures, a technological advancement attributed to progress in DNA nanotechnology. mFNA are a new type of nanomaterial formed by using framework nucleic acids (FNAs) as precise templates to guide the ordered assembly and self&#8208;assembly of metal ions, metal salts (such as calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, etc.), metal nanoclusters, metal nanoparticles, or metal oxide nanoparticles. Compared to traditional FNAs, mFNA not only inherits the powerful programmed self&#8208;assembly capabilities of nucleic acids but also incorporates the unique physicochemical properties of inorganic metal nanomaterials. This intersection of organic and inorganic chemistry presents broad application prospects in fields such as biology, chemistry, materials science, and energy science. This review, based on the principles related to FNAs, introduces the concept of mFNA for the first time, aiming to explore the fundamental connections between nanoscale FNAs and metal materials. Additionally, the article focuses on the construction methods and functional characteristics of mFNA. Finally, the current challenges faced by mFNA are reviewed, and their future development is anticipated, providing detailed information for a comprehensive understanding of the research progress in mFNA.

         <title>Coelenterazine&#8208;dependent Bioluminescence in the Cyclopoid Copepod, Triconia conifera</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The calanoid copepod has been know to be bioluminescent using coelenterazine. The cyclopoid copepod, Triconia conifera emits blue light. In this study, we identified the presence of luciferase activity to coelenterazine in T. conifera. The presence of coelenterazine in the specimen was confirmed by LC&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS/MS. These results suggested that coelenterazine&#8208;dependent bioluminescence was evolved parallelly at least twice in copepod lineages.







Abstract
Species in the cyclopoid copepod Triconia are known to be bioluminescent, emitting blue light by mechanical stimulus. In this study in Triconica conifera, we identified the presence of luciferase activity to coelenterazine, a substrate for the bioluminescence in various marine taxa such as luminous cnidarians, fishes, and crustaceans including calanoid copepods. The molecular size estimated by gel&#8208;filtration chromatography and pH dependency of the luciferase activity were similar to those in calanoid copepods. On the other hand, the reaction rate and inhibitory effect by magnesium ion were much different between them. The presence of coelenterazine in the specimen was confirmed by LC&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS/MS. Taken together with the phylogenetically distant relationship between Cyclopoida and Calanoida, our findings suggested that coelenterazine&#8208;dependent bioluminescence was evolved parallelly at least twice in copepod lineages.

         <title>Quantification of Propargylated RNA Nucleosides After Metabolic Labeling Via the Methylation Pathway</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylation is the most prevalent RNA modification, facilitated by S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM) and various methyltransferases (MTases). This work uses a clickable SAM analog to investigate nucleoside modifications in HEK293T cells by mass spectrometric analysis after metabolic labeling with propargylselenohomocysteine (PSH). It reveals higher cell viability and differences in several nucleoside methylation levels compared to HeLa cells.







Abstract
RNA modifications are involved in numerous biological processes and vary in different cell types. Methylation is the most widespread type of RNA modification and occurs via S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM). We recently developed a metabolic labeling approach based on intracellular formation of a clickable SAM analog (SeAdoYn) and demonstrated its use in mapping methyltransferase (MTase) target sites in mRNA from HeLa cells. Here we investigate how metabolic labeling via the clickable SAM analog modifies four different nucleosides in RNA of HEK293T in comparison to HeLa cells. We find that HEK293T cells retain higher cell viability upon feeding the clickable metabolic SAM precursor. In poly(A)+ RNA we find high Aprop/A levels (0.04&#8201;%) and in total RNA (but not poly(A)+ RNA) we detect prop3C, which had not been detected previously in HeLa cells. We discuss the findings in the context of data from the literature with respect to mRNA half&#8208;lives in cancer and non&#8208;cancer cell lines and suggest that CMTr2 is most likely responsible for the high Aprop level in poly(A)+ RNA.

         <title>d&#8208;Alanine, a Circadian Metabolite that Regulates Glucose Metabolism and Viral Infection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
d&#8208;Alanine is a circadian metabolite essential for life. Beyond exhibiting a pronounced circadian rhythm in its concentration within the body, d&#8208;alanine regulates the circadian rhythm itself by influencing the circadian transcriptional network, thereby modulating related physiological processes such as glucose homeostasis. d&#8208;Alanine, of the circadian, by the circadian, for the circadian.







Abstract
d&#8208;Alanine, a rare d&#8208;amino acid, exhibits a clear circadian rhythm and is present in organs associated with glucose metabolism. Recent findings have revealed that d&#8208;alanine acts on the circadian rhythm, thereby regulating physiological processes related to circadian cycles that are essential for maintaining body homeostasis. The regulation of circadian rhythm by d&#8208;alanine is vital for correcting blood glucose levels in diabetic conditions. In viral infections, d&#8208;alanine serves as a sensitive biomarker that reflects the severity of the infection, as its level drastically decreases due to consumption. Supplementation with d&#8208;alanine is effective to alleviate the progression of viral infections, potentially through the maintenance of the circadian rhythm and its associated immune responses. In addition to its role as a circadian biomarker, d&#8208;alanine also functions as a circadian regulator and exerts a wide range of physiological effects. This review summarizes the physiological roles of d&#8208;alanine as a circadian metabolite.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Polyhydroxyalkanoates From Sucrose by Recombinant Pseudomonas putida KT2440</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sucrose&#8208;utilization pathway was developed in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 using sacC from Mannheimia succiniciproducens, which encodes a &#946;&#8208;fructofuranosidase that hydrolyzes sucrose into glucose and fructose. MCL&#8208;PHA and P(3HB) were successfully produced in recombinant P. putida KT2440 expressing SacC from sucrose as a sole carbon source.







Abstract
A sucrose&#8208;utilization pathway was developed in Pseudomonas putida using sacC from Mannheimia succiniciproducens, which encodes a &#946;&#8208;fructofuranosidase that hydrolyzes sucrose into glucose and fructose. Excretion of &#946;&#8208;fructofuranosidase into the culture medium was confirmed via western blot analysis. In nitrogen&#8208;limited cultivation, P. putida expressing SacC produced 10.52&#8197;wt&#8201;% medium&#8208;chain&#8208;length polyhydroxyalkanoate (MCL&#8208;PHA), while P. putida expressing SacC along with poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) [P(3HB)] biosynthesis genes produced 9.16&#8197;wt&#8201;% P(3HB) from sucrose. Batch and fed&#8208;batch cultures of recombinant P. putida suggested that the glucose and fructose derived from sucrose can be completely utilized for cell growth and P(3HB) production. In fed&#8208;batch cultures, sucrose supplied into the fermentor to maintain its concentration around 20&#8197;g/L was rapidly hydrolyzed into glucose and fructose supporting the production of 30.2&#8197;g/L P(3HB) with 38.1&#8197;wt&#8201;%. The engineered P. putida reported herein can facilitate the production of PHAs from sucrose, an abundant and inexpensive carbon source.

         <title>Conjugation of Human N&#8208;Glycans Improves the Drug Properties of Existing Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycosylation, which can impart the beneficial properties of N&#8208;glycans to peptides and proteins, can be applied by a glycoconjugation approach at the post&#8208;synthesis stage in an aqueous environment. The synthesis of glycoconjugation&#8208;ready N&#8208;glycans does not require the manipulation of glycan carbohydrate protecting groups, allowing for their use in unprotected form.







Abstract
Glycosylation is one of the most ubiquitous post&#8208;translational modifications observed in peptides and proteins. It affects the structural and functional characteristics of these macromolecules, thereby exerting a profound influence on a multitude of biological processes. N&#8208;Glycans are expected to be a beneficial modifier for increasing the solubility and in&#8197;vivo half&#8208;life, and reducing the aggregation and immunogenicity of native bioactive peptides and proteins, which have seen limited clinical utility due to their short blood half&#8208;life and unsuitable physicochemical properties. Chemoselective glycosylation reactions that can be conducted post&#8208;synthesis and in aqueous conditions are a promising strategy for the high&#8208;throughput development of peptide/protein drugs. This &#8220;glycoconjugation&#8221; approach is particularly advantageous in that manipulation of glycan protecting groups is not necessary, thereby allowing conjugation reactions to be carried out between target molecules and unprotected glycans. By providing a single glycosylation profile, i.&#8201;e., glycan structure, number, and position, glycoconjugation not only allows the beneficial properties of N&#8208;glycans to be exploited, but also facilitates the investigation of N&#8208;glycan function.

         <title>NMR Solution Structure of the N&#8208;Terminal GSPII Domain from the Thermus Thermophilus Traffic ATPase PilF and Reconstruction of its c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP Binding Capability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
GSPII&#8208;A is the first of three consecutive GSPII domains of PilF from Thermus thermophilus and the only one that does not bind c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP. In this study we solve the structure of GSPII&#8208;A and show the key factors hindering c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP binding. Through mutagenesis, we elucidate the minimal motif conservation needed for c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP recognition.







Abstract
The cyclic dinucleotide c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP is an important second messenger molecule in bacteria and interacts with a variety of receptor molecules including RNA and protein domains. An important class of c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP&#8208;binding protein domains are the general secretory pathway type II (GSPII) domains as exemplified by the N&#8208;terminal domain of the ATPase MshE from Vibrio cholerae (MshEN). MshEN binds monomeric c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP via two consecutive copies of a 24&#8208;residue sequence motif, which form a compact 4&#8208;&#945;&#8208;helical bundle. The ATPase PilF from Thermus thermophilus regulates pilus formation, motility and DNA&#8208;uptake. Its N&#8208;terminal section contains three consecutive GSPII domains (GSPII&#8208;A&#8208;GSPII&#8208;C) all with considerable sequence homology to MshEN. While the GSPII&#8208;B and the GSPII&#8208;C domains bind c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP, the GSPII&#8208;A domain does not. To determine why it is incapable of c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP&#8208;binding we determined the NMR&#8208;solution structure of this domain. Our structure shows how small deviations in the consensus motif sequence, a stabilizing N&#8208;terminal helical capping motif and intersubdomain interactions absent in MshEN cooperate to prevent c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP&#8208;binding. By combining point mutations and truncations, we re&#8208;established the c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP binding capability. Our findings shed new light on the evolution and functional diversification of GSPII domains and the importance of sequence variations for protein activity in this domain family.

         <title>Probing Native CB2 Receptor Mobility in Plasma Membranes of Living Cells by Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study investigates CB2 receptor (CB2R) mobility in live cells using the fluorescent probe RO7304924 and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Results demonstrate the probe&#8216;s efficiency in quantifying receptor diffusion and mobility, with CB2R showing high mobile fractions and diffusion coefficients. This approach provides a non&#8208;invasive and precise tool for studying CB2R dynamics, relevant to cellular processes and receptor functions.







Abstract
In this study, we employed a novel fluorescent probe, RO7304924 &#8211; which selectively targets cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R) &#8211; to assess the lateral mobility of CB2R within the plasma membrane of Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing a functional, untagged receptor variant. Utilizing confocal fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we quantified the diffusion coefficient and mobile fraction of CB2R, thereby demonstrating the efficacy of RO7304924 as an innovative tool for elucidating the dynamics of this major endocannabinoid&#8208;binding G protein&#8208;coupled receptor. Our present findings highlight the potential of combining advanced ligand&#8208;based fluorescent probes with FRAP for future investigations into the biochemical details of CB2R mobility in living cells, and its impact on receptor&#8208;dependent cellular processes.

         <title>A Silicon Rhodamine&#8208;fused Glibenclamide to Label and Detect Malaria&#8208;infected Red Blood Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A far&#8208;red fluorescent silicon rhodamine&#8208;conjugated glibenclamide (SiR&#8208;glib) is synthesized. Labeling experiments in cells reveal the endoplasmic reticulum as the primary target of SiR&#8208;glib, and is applicable to detect malaria&#8208;infected red blood cells. The latter is possible via a portable smartphone&#8208;based microscope, with the potential for usage in malaria endemic areas.







Abstract
The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum affects the lives of millions of people worldwide every year. The detection of replicating parasites within human red blood cells is of paramount importance, requiring appropriate diagnostic tools. Herein, we design and apply a silicon rhodamine&#8208;fused glibenclamide (SiR&#8208;glib). We first test this far&#8208;red fluorescent, fluorogenic and endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;targeting sulfonylurea in mammalian cells and pancreatic islets, before characterizing its labeling performance in red blood cells infected with the asexual developmental stages of Plasmodium falciparum. We further combine SiR&#8208;glib with a portable smartphone&#8208;based microscope to easily and rapidly identify parasitized red blood cells, providing proof of principle for diagnostic use in rural endemic areas without major healthcare facilities.

The latter is possible via a portable smartphone-based microscope, with the potential for usage in malaria endemic areas.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The malaria parasite &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; affects the lives of millions of people worldwide every year. The detection of replicating parasites within human red blood cells is of paramount importance, requiring appropriate diagnostic tools. Herein, we design and apply a silicon rhodamine-fused glibenclamide (&lt;b&gt;SiR-glib&lt;/b&gt;). We first test this far-red fluorescent, fluorogenic and endoplasmic reticulum-targeting sulfonylurea in mammalian cells and pancreatic islets, before characterizing its labeling performance in red blood cells infected with the asexual developmental stages of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt;. We further combine &lt;b&gt;SiR-glib&lt;/b&gt; with a portable smartphone-based microscope to easily and rapidly identify parasitized red blood cells, providing proof of principle for diagnostic use in rural endemic areas without major healthcare facilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Expanding the Diversity of Nitroxide&#8208;Based Paramagnetic Probes Conjugated to Non&#8208;Canonical Amino Acids for Sdsl&#8208;Epr Applications</title>

Understanding protein structure requires studying its dynamics, which is critical for elucidating its functional role. Using Site&#8208;Directed Spin Labelling (SDSL) combined with Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR), a powerful method delivering structural data at the residue level, irrespective of protein size or environment, we expand the toolkit of the ncaa&#8208;nitroxide pairs, enabling EPR&#8208;based structural studies of proteins where cysteine modification is impractical.







Abstract
Understanding protein structure requires studying its dynamics, which is critical to elucidating its functional role. Biophysical techniques have revolutionized this field over time, providing remarkable insights into structure&#8208;function relationships. Among these, Site&#8208;Directed Spin Labelling (SDSL) combined with Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) is a powerful method delivering structural data at the residue level, irrespective of protein size or environment. Traditional nitroxide labels targeting cysteine residues face limitations when these residues are essential for protein structure or function. To address this, alternatives have been proposed as the use of non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncaa) coupled with specific nitroxide labels. This study introduces 14N&#8208;HO&#8208;5223, a novel nitroxide label specific to the pAzPhe ncaa, along with its 15N&#8208;derivative. These labels were grafted at two sites of the model protein, the diflavin cytochrome P450 reductase. For comparative purpose, two already reported labels were also used. Continuous wave (cw) EPR spectroscopy confirmed the HO&#8208;5223 label as an effective reporter of protein dynamics. Additionally, Double Electron&#8208;Electron Resonance (DEER) measurements provided distance distributions between the semi&#8208;quinone FMNH&#8901; state of the CPR and all nitroxide labels. These results expand the toolkit of the ncaa&#8208;nitroxide pairs, enabling EPR&#8208;based structural studies of proteins where cysteine modification is impractical, further advancing our ability to decode protein dynamics and function.

         <title>Identification and Protein Engineering of Galactosidases for the Conversion of Blood Type B to Blood Type O</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We identified and characterized a galactosidase from Pedobacter panaciterrae (PpaGal), which is more efficient than previously characterized galactosidases from the GH110 family of Bacteroides fragilis in converting B&#8208;type to O&#8208;type blood. We further increased the activity of PpaGal by enzyme engineering and solved crystal structures with and without bound galactose.







Abstract
The supply of blood products such as red blood cells poses a challenge due to rising demand and declining donor numbers. Careful matching of blood products of different types is required. Only type O of the blood types A, B, AB and O can be received by any patient without transfusion incompatibilities. Therefore, O&#8208;type blood can be considered &#8220;universal blood&#8221; and is especially needed in emergency situations. In this study, we focused on the conversion of the B antigen by enzymatic deglycosylation to generate the H antigen determining O&#8208;type blood. For this, we characterized several previously unstudied &#945;&#8208;1,3&#8208;galactosidases belonging to the GH110 family. Our findings revealed that the &#945;&#8208;1,3&#8208;galactosidase from Pedobacter panaciterrae (PpaGal) exhibits superior efficiency compared to previously described galactosidases. We further increased the activity of PpaGal by 2.5&#8208;fold using site&#8208;directed mutagenesis. Moreover, we solved two crystal structures of PpaGal, one in the apo&#8208;state and another in complex with d&#8208;galactose. The combination of our mutagenesis study with the solved crystal structures provides valuable information to guide further optimization of PpaGal or other B antigen converting enzymes paving the way for the easier production of universal blood from B&#8208;type blood.

         <dc:description>
Nanopipettes serve as versatile electrochemical tools owing to their tunable nanoscale dimensions, facile fabrication, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. The specific functional modification of the nanopipettes can improve selectivity and sensitivity, leading to broader applications in bioanalytical sensing. The image is adapted from Refs.

Abstract
Nanopipette&#8208;based assays have gained widespread applications in electrochemical and analytical technologies, achieving significant advancements over the past decade in DNA sequencing, biosensing, targeted delivery, and bioimaging. The ultrasmall tip size of nanopipettes bridges the gap between the macro&#8208; and nano worlds, which can be attributed to the capability of nanopipettes to transport ultrasmall volumes of liquids, ions, and solutes. In this review, we discuss the fabrication, characterization, and modification of nanopipettes to provide an overview of the recent developments of nanopipette&#8208;based sensors and strategies. We also introduce the recent studies developed by our group and other groups using nanopipettes for chemical analysis of life science. Finally, we discuss the future development of nanopipette&#8208;based strategies and their exciting potential for studying bioscience and biomedical engineering.

         <title>Harnessing Synthetic Riboswitches for Tunable Gene Regulation in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores using RNA switches as molecular tools for conditional gene regulation in mammalian cells. It covers the design strategies for tailoring RNA switches, their functional mechanisms in RNA&#8208;mediated regulatory processes, and their diverse applications in gene function analysis, biosensor development, and targeted gene therapies.







Abstract
RNA switches regulated by specific inducer molecules have become a powerful synthetic biology tool for precise gene regulation in mammalian systems. The engineered RNA switches can be integrated with natural RNA&#8208;mediated gene regulatory functions as a modular and customizable approach to probe and control cellular behavior. RNA switches have been used to advance synthetic biology applications, including gene therapy, bio&#8208;production, and cellular reprogramming. This review explores recent progress in the design and functional implementation of synthetic riboswitches in mammalian cells based on diverse RNA regulation mechanisms by highlighting recent studies and emerging technologies. We also discuss challenges such as off&#8208;target effects, system stability, and ligand delivery in complex biological environments. In conclusion, this review emphasizes the potential of synthetic riboswitches as a platform for customizable gene regulation in diverse biomedical applications.

         <title>Cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;Styryl dye complexes for Fluorescent Recognition of DNA and Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper focused on the DNA&#8208;binding properties of novel dicationic cyanine dyes, in which pyridinium centers are linked by bridges of different functionalities. We found that dye 1, bearing a flexible butyl&#8208;4&#8208;methylpyridinium terminal fragment, has the ability to bind to the DNA groove. The attachment of a quite rigid para&#8208;xylylene&#8208;4&#8208;methylpyridinium unit as a terminal group in dye 2 contributed to dual DNA&#8208;binding modes: intercalation and groove binding. We tested the encapsulation ability and the effect on the dye&#8208;DNA binding mode by using a synthetic molecular container such as CB[7]. Unexpectedly, monitoring dye&#8208;DNA interaction in the presence of CB[7] revealed that dye molecules partially remain in DNA frameworks, even though they had a higher affinity towards CB[7]. In the case of dye 1, the transformation of dimeric forms to the left&#8208;handed aggregates to yield a ternary system CB[7]&#8208;dye&#8208;DNA occurred. For dye 2, reversibility of intercalation and a slight right&#8208;handed aggregation templated by DNA are observed. A cytotoxicity and ability of dyes to stain the living cells in their free and encapsulated forms have been investigated. These findings provide useful information about ligand&#8211;DNA interactions, which are valuable for the rational design of drug delivery systems and platforms for cellular imaging and therapy.</dc:description>

The attachment of a quite rigid para-xylylene-4-methylpyridinium unit as a terminal group in dye 2 contributed to dual DNA-binding modes: intercalation and groove binding. We tested the encapsulation ability and the effect on the dye-DNA binding mode by using a synthetic molecular container such as CB[7]. Unexpectedly, monitoring dye-DNA interaction in the presence of CB[7] revealed that dye molecules partially remain in DNA frameworks, even though they had a higher affinity towards CB[7]. In the case of dye 1, the transformation of dimeric forms to the left-handed aggregates to yield a ternary system CB[7]-dye-DNA occurred. For dye 2, reversibility of intercalation and a slight right-handed aggregation templated by DNA are observed. A cytotoxicity and ability of dyes to stain the living cells in their free and encapsulated forms have been investigated. These findings provide useful information about ligand&#8211;DNA interactions, which are valuable for the rational design of drug delivery systems and platforms for cellular imaging and therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
