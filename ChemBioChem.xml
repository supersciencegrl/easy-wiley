         <title>Cover Feature: From Structure to Function: Development of Relaxin&#8208;3 Analogs and their Role in RXFP3 Signaling (ChemBioChem 1/2026)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 27, Issue 1, January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The RXFP3/Relaxin&#8208;3 system is implicated in behaviors such as addiction, anxiety and depression, making it an attractive pharmaceutical target. Because RXFP3 is primarily located in the central nervous system, achieving blood&#8211;brain barrier penetration is crucial. The cover depicts the relaxin family peptide receptor 3 and its ligand relaxin&#8208;3 in the bottom left corner, with key reported small molecules shown in white. The alpha helix in the background represents recently developed single&#8208;chain peptidomimetics. More details can be found in the Research Article by Mohammed Akhter Hossain and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.202500664).

This image depicts the mechanism of Photo&#8208;induced Duplex Invasion (pDI). The artwork illustrates how a single invading strand, modified with the 3&#8208;cyanovinylcarbazole nucleoside (CNVK), targets long double&#8208;stranded DNA. Under UV irradiation, this modification enables the strand to rapidly open the DNA helix and cross&#8208;link to its target sequence. This visual demonstrates the high efficiency of the pDI strategy for recognizing specific genetic sequences, holding significant potential for applications in biotechnology and genomic engineering. More details can be found in the Research Article by Kenzo Fujimoto and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/cbic.202500626).

         <title>Design, Synthesis, Molecular Docking, Structure Activity Relationship, and In Vivo Evaluation of Pyrazole&#8211;Pyrimidines for Discovering New Nonsteroidal Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Drugs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of pyrazole&#8211;pyrimidines was synthesized. Compounds 4d, 4j, and 4k showed higher binding affinity to COX&#8208;2 in molecular docking studies, corroborated by ADMET predictions, which indicated favorable pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties. Compounds 4d, 4e, 4f, 4j, and 4k were as effective as celecoxib in attenuating the nociceptive behaviors of mice, without causing locomotor alterations.

Nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs are among the most prescribed worldwide to treat pain, fever, and inflammation. However, they can cause severe adverse effects such as gastric, duodenal, hepatic, and renal injuries. Thus, the search for effective and new drugs is of high priority. Herein, the synthesis of a new series 4&#8208;((5&#8208;substituted&#8208;3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methyl)&#8208;6&#8208;(trifluoromethyl) pyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;substituted (pyrazole&#8211;pyrimidines) obtained through the cyclocondensation reaction of pyrazole&#8211;enaminones with amidines under mild conditions is reported. The chemical structures are confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR, mass spectrometry, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis for compounds 4c and 4g. Molecular docking studies are conducted to identify selective cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2) inhibitors, revealing that compounds 4d, 4j, and 4k display higher binding affinity. ADMET predictions (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) corroborate to the docking results, suggesting favorable pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties. The in&#8201;vivo antinociceptive activity is investigated in mice using the capsaicin&#8208;induced nociception model. Oral administration of compounds 4d, 4e, 4f, 4j, and 4k significantly reduces nociceptive responses, achieving effects comparable or superior to celecoxib, without altering locomotor activity. Altogether, the findings demonstrate that pyrazole&#8211;pyrimidine derivatives, especially 4d and 4k, are promising candidates for the development of selective COX&#8208;2 analgesics, combining antinociceptive efficacy with a favorable toxicological profile.

         <title>Staphylococcal SplA and SplB Serine Protease Allelic Variants Exhibit Different Substrate Specificities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biochemical characterization of Staphylococcus aureus serine proteases SplA and SplB allelic variants (recombinantly produced in E. coli and purified) reveals that allelic variation adds an extra layer of complexity to the functioning of virulence factors in S. aureus colonization and infection. This highlights the importance of considering allelic variation in the study of host&#8208;pathogen interactions.

Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen that is persistently colonizing nearly 30% of the human population and can cause life&#8208;threatening infections. S. aureus secretes a variety of virulence factors, such as a set of extracellular serine protease&#8208;like proteins (Spls). Spls are expressed by most clinical isolates of S. aureus, but their pathophysiological substrates and role during infection are largely unknown. Pathogens use allelic variation of virulence factors to allow an adaption to different host cells and their defense mechanisms. The differences of these variants are marginally characterized so far. Here, we performed a biochemical characterization of selected allelic variants of the S. aureus SplA and SplB. Our data suggests different variants show differences in their stability, enzymatic activity, and substrate specificity. For the recently identified Spl target proteins RickULP and SseL, different cleavage patterns were observed, upon treatment with different Spl allelic variants. One SplB variant strongly differed in its substrate recognition at the P3/P4 position, more closely resembling SplE than SplB wildtype in its substrate selectivity. Our data provide valuable insights into the evolution of bacterial virulence factors and highlight the importance of including allelic variation of virulence factors to fully understand their role in host&#8211;pathogen interaction.

         <title>Modulation of Liquid&#8208;to&#8208;Solid Phase Transition in Coacervates for Neurodegenerative Disease Treatments</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the factors influencing the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transition of coacervates, including physical stimuli, molecular modulators, and sequence changes.

Coacervates formed through liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation represent a fundamental model for protocell and serve as a membraneless organelle in living cells, modulating various biological processes. During aging or under stress, protein misfolding and oligomerization trigger aberrant liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transition (LSPT), a process driven by multivalent interactions.

&lt;p&gt;This review summarizes the factors influencing the liquid-to-solid phase transition of coacervates, including physical stimuli, molecular modulators, and sequence changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coacervates formed through liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation represent a fundamental model for protocell and serve as a membraneless organelle in living cells, modulating various biological processes. During aging or under stress, protein misfolding and oligomerization trigger aberrant liquid-to-solid phase transition (LSPT), a process driven by multivalent interactions. These phase transitions disrupt cellular equilibrium, leading to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The regulatory strategies is summarize to enhance molecular interactions in coacervate LSPT into three categories, including physical stimulation, molecular modulation, and sequence regulation. This review aims to establish a conceptual framework for modulating coacervate LSPT and further explores potential clinical treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereocontrol of Styrene Monooxygenases: Mechanistic Principles of (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;Selective Epoxidations and Their Implications for Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Styrene monooxygenases with different enantioselectivities allow olefins to adopt distinct binding orientations within the catalytic cavity, leading the O&#8208;atom of C4a&#8208;hydroperoxyflavin (FADOOH) to attack either the Re&#8208;face or the Si&#8208;face of the substrate. This difference in attack direction ultimately determines the resulting enantioselectivity.

Numerous styrene monooxygenases (SMOs) have been identified and extensively applied in the asymmetric epoxidation of alkenes to prepare enantiopure epoxides, which are important intermediates in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and fine chemicals. A current challenge is development of engineered SMOs capable of catalyzing a broad range of substrates with complementary enantioselectivity, thereby enabling the production of both (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;epoxides. Achieving this requires a deep understanding of the molecular basis underlying enantiocontrolling in SMO&#8208;catalyzed epoxidation. In this concept article, recent progress in elucidating the mechanisms of enantiocontrol by SMOs is summarized, with particular emphasis on the structural and mechanistic features that differentiate (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;selective SMOs. These insights not only expand fundamental knowledge of SMO catalysis but also provide a critical foundation for the rational design and protein engineering of highly efficient and versatile SMOs.

         <title>A Stable Bioisostere of Ester&#8208;Linked Ubiquitin Chains Enables Decoding of Protein Interactors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ester&#8208;to&#8208;amide analog of an ester&#8208;linked ubiquitin dimer is chemically synthesized through a convergent approach involving the sequential chemoselective ligation of three peptide fragments generated through Fmoc&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. The hydrolysis&#8208;resistant ubiquitin dimer served as a chemical probe in the identification of potential reader of the ester&#8208;linked ubiquitin chain.

Protein ubiquitination is a pivotal posttranslational modification that regulates diverse biological processes depending on the type of ubiquitin chain linkage. Recently, ester&#8208;linked ubiquitin chains have been identified, yet their inherent hydrolytic instability has posed a significant challenge for biochemical investigations. In this study, a stable and isosteric amide analog of an ester&#8208;linked ubiquitin dimer, is chemically synthesized in which serine (Ser) at position 20 of the proximal ubiquitin is replaced with 2,3&#8208;diaminopropionic acid (Dap). The desired amide analog is synthesized using a convergent approach involving the sequential chemoselective ligation of three peptide fragments generated through Fmoc&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. Employing this chemically robust ubiquitin probe, a previously unrecognized interaction is uncovered between Ser20&#8208;linked ubiquitin chains and spliceosome&#8208;associated factors, notably ubiquitin&#8208;specific protease 39. These findings highlight the potential of the ester&#8208;to&#8208;amide bioisosteric strategy to unlock mechanistic insights into atypical ubiquitin modifications. The approach not only circumvents the intrinsic instability of ester&#8208;linked ubiquitin chains but also provides a broadly applicable framework for dissecting their biological roles, paving the way for future discoveries in ubiquitin signaling.

         <title>Synthesis of Lipid&#8208;Conjugated Heparan Sulfate Mimetics and Their Effect on Complement Inhibition</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three function&#8208;spacer&#8208;lipid constructs containing sulfated maltose in monomeric or clustered (dimeric or trimeric) form are synthesized as complement inhibitors. The conjugation of maltose clusters with spacer&#8208;armed lipid is carried out with the use of CuAAC click reaction.

Heavily sulfated clusters of maltose are designed as mimetics of heparan sulfate (HS), exhibiting diverse biological activity properties of HS. Herein, the synthesis of three function&#8208;spacer&#8208;lipid (FSL) constructs containing mono, di, and tri sulfated maltoses is reported. FSLs are a class of synthetic glycolipids, the key features of which are simplicity of synthesis and capacity to integrate into cell membranes with sustained retention. A copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition click reaction is employed for the conjugation of the sulfated maltose entities with the respective spacer&#8208;lipid block because acylation with activated esters failed to provide the desired products. One FSL construct, featuring a single sulfated maltose unit conjugated to the lipid, demonstrated dose&#8208;dependent inhibition of complement activation in a cellular system, with maximal efficacy observed at 15 &#181;g mL&#8722;1. These findings highlight the potential of FSL&#8208;based HS mimetics for modulating immune responses.

Computational Analysis Uncovering Contrasts in G&#8208;Quadruplex Propensity and Aptamer Enrichment in SELEX&#8208;Derived Libraries</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aptamer selection&#8208;derived RNA libraries targeting a DNA G&#8208;quadruplex are profiled by both sequence abundance and three G&#8208;quadruplex&#160;(G4)&#8208;prediction tools. High G4 scores failed to match enrichment or binding, revealing that current G4 predictors alone cannot reliably prioritize functional aptamers and must be combined with abundance&#8208;based and experimental validation workflows.

G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) are noncanonical nucleic acid structures with biological and therapeutic significance, and they are found in many aptamer sequences. Using c&#8208;kit 1 G4 DNA as a target, systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) has been carried out using an RNA library, resulting in G4&#8208;rich aptamers. Herein, this article investigates the relationship between predicted G4&#8208;forming potential and aptamer enrichment by analyzing high&#8208;throughput SELEX libraries using three G4 prediction tools: G4NN, G4Hunter, and QGRS Mapper. While the tools demonstrate strong internal consistency and overlap in identifying G4&#8208;prone sequences, their predictions show limited concordance with experimental abundance and enrichment trends across SELEX rounds. Only a small fraction of sequences display both high G4 scores and consistent enrichment. Experimental validation using electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that strong predicted G4&#8208;forming sequences often lack strong binding activity, whereas highly enriched aptamers with strong binding activities may show weaker G4 signatures computationally. These findings suggest that current G4&#8208;prediction tools alone are insufficient for aptamer candidate selection and highlight the need for integrative evaluation strategies that combine structural prediction with empirical performance data.

         <title>Dual COX&#8208;2/5&#8208;LOX Inhibition by Novel Thymol Derivatives: From Molecular Modeling to In Vitro Validation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8201;silico studies on a series of novel thymol derivatives reveal improved binding affinities, enhanced stability, and persistent interactions within the active pockets of COX&#8208;2 and 5&#8208;LOX enzymes, with respect to thymol and its halogenated derivatives. Cell&#8208;free assays highlight T3 as the most potent COX&#8208;2 inhibitor, while T1 and T3 exhibit similar activity on 5&#8208;LOX.

Dual cyclooxygenase&#8208;2/5&#8208;lipoxygenase (COX&#8208;2/5&#8208;LOX) inhibitors constitute safer alternatives to classical nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs, widely used to effectively manage inflammation. In this article, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations guide the synthesis of novel thymol derivatives that interact with both COX&#8208;2 and 5&#8208;LOX active sites. Ligands are designed with the aim of improving thymol bioactivity, selectivity, stability, as well as pharmacokinetic properties. Therefore, &#8211;Br, &#8211;F, and &#8211;CF3 inclusion on thymol is here evaluated, screening COX&#8208;2 and 5&#8208;LOX interactions with thymol (T), 4&#8208;fluorothymol (FT), 4&#8208;bromothymol (BT), isopropyl thymyl succinate (T1), 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropyl thymyl succinate (T2), and 1&#8242;,1&#8242;,1&#8242;,3&#8242;,3&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;hexafluoroisopropyl 4&#8208;(4&#8242;&#8217;&#8208;thymyl)&#8208;4&#8208;oxobutanoate (T3). Molecular modeling reveals that the estimated ligands can establish favorable interactions with both COX&#8208;2 and 5&#8208;LOX active pockets, highlighting T1&#8211;T3 as the most promising compounds. In&#8201;vitro assays identify T3 as the most active COX&#8208;2 inhibitor, while T2 results as the most effective ligand for 5&#8208;LOX. Interestingly, cavity analysis of the COX&#8208;2 entry site reveals that T3 insertion is favored over T1 and T2 due to its greater polarity, conferred by the presence of a free phenolic group (OH) able to establish H&#8208;bonds with surrounding residues.

     alt="Dual COX-2/5-LOX Inhibition by Novel Thymol Derivatives: From Molecular Modeling to In Vitro Validation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In&#8201;silico studies on a series of novel thymol derivatives reveal improved binding affinities, enhanced stability, and persistent interactions within the active pockets of COX-2 and 5-LOX enzymes, with respect to thymol and its halogenated derivatives. Cell-free assays highlight T3 as the most potent COX-2 inhibitor, while T1 and T3 exhibit similar activity on 5-LOX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dual cyclooxygenase-2/5-lipoxygenase (COX-2/5-LOX) inhibitors constitute safer alternatives to classical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, widely used to effectively manage inflammation. In this article, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations guide the synthesis of novel thymol derivatives that interact with both COX-2 and 5-LOX active sites. Ligands are designed with the aim of improving thymol bioactivity, selectivity, stability, as well as pharmacokinetic properties. Therefore, &#8211;Br, &#8211;F, and &#8211;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; inclusion on thymol is here evaluated, screening COX-2 and 5-LOX interactions with thymol (&lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt;), 4-fluorothymol (&lt;b&gt;FT&lt;/b&gt;), 4-bromothymol (&lt;b&gt;BT&lt;/b&gt;), isopropyl thymyl succinate (&lt;b&gt;T1&lt;/b&gt;), 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropyl thymyl succinate (&lt;b&gt;T2&lt;/b&gt;), and 1&#8242;,1&#8242;,1&#8242;,3&#8242;,3&#8242;,3&#8242;-hexafluoroisopropyl 4-(4&#8242;&#8217;-thymyl)-4-oxobutanoate (&lt;b&gt;T3&lt;/b&gt;). Molecular modeling reveals that the estimated ligands can establish favorable interactions with both COX-2 and 5-LOX active pockets, highlighting &lt;b&gt;T1&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&#8211;T3&lt;/b&gt; as the most promising compounds. In&#8201;vitro assays identify &lt;b&gt;T3&lt;/b&gt; as the most active COX-2 inhibitor, while &lt;b&gt;T2&lt;/b&gt; results as the most effective ligand for 5-LOX. Interestingly, cavity analysis of the COX-2 entry site reveals that &lt;b&gt;T3&lt;/b&gt; insertion is favored over &lt;b&gt;T1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;T2&lt;/b&gt; due to its greater polarity, conferred by the presence of a free phenolic group (OH) able to establish H-bonds with surrounding residues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Three Recent para&#8208;Nitrobenzyl&#8208;Based Hypoxia Probes: Promising Directions for Sensitivity, Reversibility, or Near&#8208;IR Emission</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progresses on nitroaromatics&#8208;based hypoxia probes address the challenges with respect to sensitivity, reversibility, and in&#8201;vivo capability.

Hypoxia bioimaging attracts tremendous attention due to its profound implications in diagnosis of a range of pathological conditions. Nitroaromatics&#8208;based fluorescent probes are the most popular approach to tackle this problem. Despite intensive efforts of the field over the past 15&#8201;years and the development of a range of such probes, three challenges are still not addressed, i.e., highly sensitive probes necessitating a one&#8208;electron reduction, real&#8208;time monitoring probes with reversible sensing capability, and near&#8208;infrared probes with in&#8201;vivo imaging potentials. Three groups have recently reported notable progresses regarding these challenges, which may spur another wave of development along this line of research and meet the need of real&#8208;world applications from researchers and doctors.

         <title>Engineering Biocompatible Metal&#8208;Based Nanoparticles for Advanced Antibacterial Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effective treatment of bacterial infections requires metal nanoparticles (MNPs) that eradicate pathogens at the infection site without impairing tissue&#8208;cell proliferation or extracellular matrix remodeling. This review highlights recent engineering strategies that improve the biocompatibility of MNPs while maintaining their antibacterial efficacy.

The rapid emergence of antibiotic resistance has rendered many conventional antibiotics ineffective, complicating the management of bacterial infections and leading to severe community&#8208; and hospital&#8208;acquired diseases. This growing resistance crisis poses a major threat to global public health and the stability of healthcare systems. Metal&#8208;based nanoparticles have recently gained significant attention as alternative antibacterial agents because of their broad&#8208;spectrum activity and low likelihood of inducing bacterial resistance. However, their clinical translation remains limited by nonspecific cytotoxicity and poor biocompatibility, which can adversely affect mammalian cells. To overcome these challenges, recent research has focused on engineering strategies that enhance the biocompatibility of metal nanoparticles (MNPs) without compromising their antibacterial efficacy. This review summarizes the latest advances in the rational design, surface modification, and functionalization of biocompatible metal&#8208;based nanoplatforms for infection treatment. Themechanisms of antibacterial action, approaches to minimize off&#8208;target toxicity, and potential clinical application. Together, these insights highlight the promise of engineered MNPs as next&#8208;generation antibacterial therapeutics capable of addressing the escalating threat of multidrug&#8208;resistant infections.

         <title>Amyloid&#8208;Inducing Agents via Metabolite Self&#8208;Assembly Expands the Boundary of Prion Concept beyond Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Origin of Prion&#8208;like Amyloid Nucleating Nanostructures via Metabolite Self&#8208;assembly.

The prion concept fundamentally signifies the intrinsic cross&#8208;seeding potential of misfolded protein&#8208;generated amyloid entities to efficiently induce amyloid aggregation in normally folded proteins leading to formation of cytotoxic amyloid structures. A conformational crosstalk between the prion particle and the interacting protein appears critical for the molecular origin of seeded&#8208;aggregation. However, the intricacies of protein specificity, as a prerequisite for the onset of cross&#8208;seeding, hold negligible relevance to the pathobiology of amyloid&#8208;linked diseases because the amyloid&#8208;deposits are heteroprotein assemblies, and there is adequate evidence that substantiates the occurrence of sequence&#8208;independent amyloid&#8208;cross&#8208;seeding/co&#8208;aggregation reactions between diverse protein types. Importantly, extensive research on the self&#8208;assembly of single metabolites into cytotoxic amyloid&#8208;like entities containing cross&#8208;seeding competent conformers has certainly widened the boundary of prion concept much beyond the territory of proteins and peptides. Three important observations: 1) sequence&#8208;independent cross&#8208;seeding and co&#8208;aggregation among proteins; 2) efficient amyloid&#8208;cross&#8208;seeding of proteins triggered by self&#8208;assembled metabolite&#8208;nanostructures, and 3) molecular self&#8208;assembly of metabolites induced by pre&#8208;formed protein amyloid&#8208;seeds, propose a synergetic interplay between the amyloidogenic proteins and self&#8208;assembly&#8208;prone metabolites that can act as a key regulator for the overall amyloidogenesis mechanism. This review on the self&#8208;assembly of biologically relevant metabolites into amyloid&#8208;mimicking nanostructures mainly highlights their cytotoxic properties and cross&#8208;seeding potential, particularly focusing on the significance of the metabolite&#8208;aggregation in the etiology of amyloid hypothesis.

         <title>Simultaneous Visualization of Distinct Posttranslational Modification States of &#946;&#8208;Catenin Using Genetic Code Expansion and Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to visualize, within the same cell, three distinct posttranslational forms of &#946;&#8208;catenin: wild&#8208;type, phosphomimetic (T41E), and synthetic T41C&#8208;GlcNAc, using genetic code expansion and fluorescence microscopy is developed. This strategy reveals how modifications at T41 alter &#946;&#8208;catenin localization and stability.

A novel strategy based on genetic code expansion combined with click chemistry for the simultaneous visualization of distinct posttranslational modification (PTM) states of a single protein within living cells. As a model, it is focused on threonine 41 (T41) of &#946;&#8208;catenin, a regulatory hotspot implicated in epithelial cancers and known to be phosphorylated, O&#8208;GlcNAcylated, or left unmodified. Using site&#8208;specific incorporation of the unnatural phenylselenocysteine, a &#946;&#8208;catenin&#8208;EGFP fusion protein is engineered allowing selective installation of a S&#8208;GlcNAc moiety via oxidative elimination and thiol&#8208;Michael ligation. Additional &#946;&#8208;catenin variants, phosphomimetic T41E&#8208;mCherry and wild&#8208;type&#8208;blue fluorescent protein fusions, are produced to represent other PTM states. All constructs are successfully introduced into Hep3B and HeLa cells by lipofection or TAT&#8208;mediated transduction. Fluorescence microscopy revealed distinct subcellular localization profiles for each PTM form. Notably, the S&#8208;GlcNAcylated &#946;&#8208;catenin exhibited enhanced resistance to proteasomal degradation, consistent with known roles of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in protein stability. This approach provides a versatile platform to functionally probe PTMs in a comparative, cell&#8208;based context.

         <title>A Thermostable Class III Phosphoribosyl Pyrophosphate Synthetase from Pyrolobus fumarii 1A: Characterization and Application Potential for Phosphoribosyl Pyrophosphate Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class III phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase (PfPRS) from the hyper thermophilic archaeon Pyrolobus fumarii 1A was identified and characterized. PfPRS exhibited exceptional thermal and pH stability, retaining high activity even at 100&#8201;&#176;C. Its robust catalytic features, along with exploratory co&#8208;immobilization for nucleotide regeneration, highlight its promise for biocatalytic applications.

Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) functions as a central metabolic intermediate, supplying ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate moieties for the biosynthesis of nucleotides, certain amino acids, and a range of essential cofactors. In this study, a thermostable phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase (PfPRS) was identified from the hyper thermophilic archaeon Pyrolobus fumarii 1A, a hyper thermophilic archaeon that grows optimally at 90&#8211;113&#8201;&#176;C. The prs gene was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant enzyme was purified and characterized. Peak catalytic activity of PfPRS was observed at approximately pH 7.5 and 55&#8201;&#176;C and retained over 85% of its activity after 2&#8201;h of incubation across pH 4.0&#8211;10.5. PfPRS exhibited high thermal stability. The enzyme exhibited half&#8208;lives of 12&#8201;h at 90&#8201;&#176;C, 5&#8201;h at 95&#8201;&#176;C, and 3&#8201;h at 100&#8201;&#176;C. Among the nucleotides tested as diphosphate donors, PfPRS showed a strong preference for ATP, whereas ADP served as an effective inhibitor. Kinetic analysis revealed Km values of 35&#8201;&#181;M for R5P and 46&#8201;&#181;M for ATP, with turnover rates (kcat) of 71&#8201;s&#8722;1 and 56&#8201;s&#8722;1. PfPRS was co&#8208;immobilized with polyphosphate kinase 2 (DrPPK2) from Deinococcus radiodurans using a cross&#8208;linked enzyme aggregate (CLEA) system to enable ATP regeneration and to explore the feasibility of using PfPRS for PRPP biosynthesis.

         <title>A Robust Bioprocess for the Global Incorporation of Noncanonical Amino Acids in Auxotrophic Hosts Produces Labeled Proteins at the Gram Scale</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust bioprocess enables global incorporation of noncanonical amino acids in both shake flask and bioreactor cultures, producing gram&#8208;per&#8208;liter titers of efficiently labeled proteins. A versatile Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) auxotroph platform supports broad compatibility with various noncanonical amino acids and target proteins, facilitating flexible and scalable designer protein production.

This study presents a robust bioprocess for the global incorporation of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins, enabling gram&#8208;scale production in auxotrophic Escherichia coli strains. The two&#8208;phase approach adapts from shake flask to bioreactor cultures and relies on cost&#8208;effective synthetic minimal media with glucose as the sole carbon source and yeast extract as an amino acid supply. It supports both external ncAA supplementation and in situ biosynthesis. A versatile E. coli BL21(DE3) auxotroph platform ensures broad ncAA and protein compatibility. Model proteins, such as a thermophilic lipase (TTL) and an oxidoreductase are labeled with biosynthesized norleucine (Nle), synthetic fluoroprolines, and fluorophenylalanine. Under optimal conditions, we achieved titers of up to 2&#8201;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 with near&#8208;quantitative incorporation. To demonstrate the utility of the bioprocess for applications that require substantial amounts of proteins, the crystal structure of Nle&#8208;labeled TTL is solved. Future work should optimize media composition and feeding strategies to improve ncAA bioavailability and integrate biosynthesis pathways into the host genome to reduce metabolic burden and eliminate antibiotic use. These advances will make the process a cost&#8208;effective industrial platform for designer protein production.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Phase Enzymatic Cascade for Indigo Synthesis from Anthranilate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This five&#8208;step enzymatic cascade for indigo synthesis is derived from the natural biosynthetic route starting from anthranilate. A two&#8208;phase system addresses enzyme incompatibility, and process engineering through stepwise parameter optimization for each phase results in a titer of 183&#8201;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 indigo. This work establishes a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept enzymatic platform that expands the toolbox for designing bio&#8208;based indigo synthesis.

Herein, an enzymatic in&#8201;vitro synthesis route to indigo, the dye that gives denim its renowned color, is described. The proposed five&#8208;step enzymatic pathway is derived from the natural biosynthesis route starts from anthranilate. In the context of the bio&#8208;based economy, this method provides an alternative to the current method of indigo synthesis, which relies on petroleum&#8208;based building blocks. First, the enzymes are assessed by stepwise addition to detect intermediate compounds, to ensure cascade function. A two&#8208;phase system is designed in response to differences in melting temperatures of the enzymes. A titer of 183&#8201;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 indigo is reached through stepwise parameter optimization for each phase, followed by process engineering to enhance the indigo titer. Continuous supplementation of the cosubstrate phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate is necessary to maintain indole&#8208;3&#8208;glycerol phosphate (IGP) formation in the first phase. During the second phase, complete uptake of IGP by ZmBX1 remains challenging, and formation of significant byproducts is observed. Despite attempts to resolve these issues, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Although the yield must be significantly improved for an economically viable process, an enzymatic cascade based on bio&#8208;based materials remains a potential alternative for sustainable denim dye synthesis by circumventing host toxicity observed in whole&#8208;cell approaches.

         <title>Advancements in Targeted Radiopharmaceuticals: Innovations in Diagnosis and Therapy for Enhanced Cancer Management</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiopharmaceuticals enable precise cancer diagnosis and targeted therapy by combining radioactive isotopes with carrier molecules. This review summarizes advances from 2014 to 2025, emphasizing probe design, click chemistry, novel targets, and nanodelivery systems. It highlights clinical progress, theranostic innovations, and future challenges in scalability, regulation, and AI&#8208;driven personalized treatment planning in precision oncology

Radiopharmaceuticals (RPhs) represent a breakthrough in nuclear medicine due to their ability to provide precise diagnosis and targeted therapy for cancer by incorporating radioactive isotopes into carrier molecules. This review systematically discusses the recent advances in the development of RPhs, focusing on state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art probe design strategies and click chemistry applications that accelerate RPh syntheses and improve targeting efficiency. The manuscript synthesizes literature from multiple databases spanning January 2014 to April 2025, encompassing diagnostic modalities including positron emission tomography (PET) and single&#8208;photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging, and therapeutic applications utilizing alpha and beta emitters such as 225Ac and 177Lu. Clinically approved agents, such as 177Lu&#8208;DOTATATE and 177Lu&#8208;PSMA&#8208;617, are used for neuroendocrine tumors and metastatic castration&#8208;resistant prostate cancer, respectively, with significant therapeutic efficacy. The review focuses on new targets, such as fibroblast activation protein, CXCR4 chemokine receptors, and gastrin&#8208;releasing peptide receptors, and new delivery systems using nanotechnology to improve biodistribution and tumor accumulation. Challenges regarding production scalability, regulatory frameworks, and integrating artificial intelligence for personalized dosimetry and treatment planning remain crucial. Combination therapeutic approaches using targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) in synergy with chemotherapy and immunotherapy and external beam radiation are showing promising results in refractory cancers. The potential avenues include theranostics, predictive modeling for patient selection, and new molecular targeting strategies. This review highlights the transformative potential of RPhs in precision oncology, providing an overview of the current clinical applications and future research trajectories toward improved cancer management.

         <title>Design and Fabrication of a Versatile Microreactor to Study Transaminase&#8208;Based Heterogeneous Biocatalysts in Flow</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile microdevice loaded with an immobilized amine transaminase can be operated as either a packed&#8208;bed or fluidized microreactor depending on the flow direction. This setup is very useful to characterize the performance of immobilized enzymes under different reactor configurations.

Microfluidics is a very attractive discipline for implementing more versatile high&#8208;throughput screening methods to improve enzymes. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art microfluidics set&#8208;ups are mainly devoted to screening enzymes in solution, while screening of enzyme immobilization protocols using microfluidics is scarce. In this work, a microreactor device is designed, fabricated and applied to test different heterogeneous biocatalysts with transaminase activity. This microsystem set&#8208;up can be operated in two different modes: packed&#8208;bed (PBR) and fluidized (FBR) microreactors without exchanging the sample. Using the same sample to run the two modes, the fidelity of the comparison is increased between the two fluid dynamic regimes. Moreover, by testing different carriers under different modes, a Histagged transaminase is found from Pseudomonas fluorescens immobilized on agarose porous microbeads functionalized with cobalt&#8208;chelates and operated as FBR maximizes the STY, and minimizes the equilibration times. This device exemplifies the potential of microreactors for prototyping more efficient heterogeneous biocatalysts.

&lt;p&gt;Microfluidics is a very attractive discipline for implementing more versatile high-throughput screening methods to improve enzymes. However, state-of-the-art microfluidics set-ups are mainly devoted to screening enzymes in solution, while screening of enzyme immobilization protocols using microfluidics is scarce. In this work, a microreactor device is designed, fabricated and applied to test different heterogeneous biocatalysts with transaminase activity. This microsystem set-up can be operated in two different modes: packed-bed (PBR) and fluidized (FBR) microreactors without exchanging the sample. Using the same sample to run the two modes, the fidelity of the comparison is increased between the two fluid dynamic regimes. Moreover, by testing different carriers under different modes, a Histagged transaminase is found from &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas fluorescens&lt;/i&gt; immobilized on agarose porous microbeads functionalized with cobalt-chelates and operated as FBR maximizes the STY, and minimizes the equilibration times. This device exemplifies the potential of microreactors for prototyping more efficient heterogeneous biocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Comparative Binding Studies of the Chelators Methylolanthanin and Rhodopetrobactin B to Lanthanides and Ferric Iron</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and the investigation of the lanthanide (Ln) and Fe&#8208;binding properties of the putative lanthanophore methylolanthanin (MLL) and the siderophore rhodopetrobactin B (RPB B) are reported. While both chelators bind Lns, they unexpectedly precipitate with Lns under biologically relevant conditions and thereby challenge the proposed classic siderophore&#8208;like Ln uptake.

The question of lanthanide (Ln) uptake in Ln&#8208;using bacteria has gained a lot of attention in recent years, and the existence of specific Ln&#8208;binding metallophores, termed lanthanophores, has been postulated. Here, the recently isolated metallophore methylolanthanin (MLL), which is shown to be involved in Ln metabolism of Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 along the structurally related siderophore rhodopetrobactin B (RPB B), is investigated. The total synthesis of both chelators as well as Ln&#8208;binding investigations employing a multitude of spectroscopic methods is reported. Compared to MLL, RPB B has a higher binding affinity for Fe3+. Unexpectedly, both metallophores seem to precipitate Lns under biologically relevant conditions (pH and concentration range). Therefore, a solubility product of &#8722;12.07 &#177; 0.24 mol2&#8201;L&#8722;2 for the precipitated Eu3+&#8208;MLL complex is reported. Furthermore, a combination of single&#8208;cell inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and Liquid Chromatography&#8208;Mass Spectrometry (LC&#8208;MS) analysis of bacterial supernatant to investigate the Nd accumulation as well as MLL secretion under Fe limitation in M. extorquens AM1 is used. Finally, ion mobility spectrometry&#8208;mass spectrometry and quantum chemical calculations are used to investigate the RPB B and MLL complexation in the gas phase with Fe3+ and all rare earth elements (except Pm). The results challenge the classical siderophore&#8208;like Ln uptake (via simple solubilization) through MLL and underline again a potential complex interplay between Fe3+ and Ln3+ in microbial Ln uptake.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;O&#8208;Glycosylation at Tyrosine 10 Promotes the Astrocyte Clearance of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Peptide 1&#8211;42</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tyr10 O&#8208;glycosylation stabilizes A&#946;42 oligomers, promotes the endocytosis by astrocytes via TLR4 and SR&#8208;A, improves intracellular degradation and IDE secretion, and ultimately rescues spatial cognitive deficits in AD&#8208;like mice, uncovering novel role of Tyr10 O&#8208;glycan in regulating A&#946; clearance in the brain.

Therapies targeting amyloid &#946; (A&#946;), especially promoting A&#946; clearance, have attracted increasing attention in treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the regulatory factors in A&#946; metabolism remain poorly understood. Herein, three homogeneously glycosylated A&#946;42 peptides are utilized to explore the impacts of Tyr10 O&#8208;glycosylation on A&#946; clearance in astrocytes. Based on various biochemical and cellular assays, it is shown that the introduced &#945;&#8208;O&#8208;glycan stabilizes the A&#946; oligomers and enhances A&#946;42 endocytosis and autophagy in astrocytes, which ultimately promotes the intracellular degradation of A&#946;42 and the secretion of A&#946;&#8208;degrading enzymes. Particularly, a disaccharide, Gal&#946;1&#8208;3GalNAc, exhibits the most substantial clearance&#8208;enhancing effect. Moreover, experiments with AD&#8208;like model mice show protective effects from the disaccharide modification in alleviating A&#946;42&#8208;induced impairment of spatial cognitive performance. Thus, beyond showing the influences induced by particular O&#8208;glycosylation on A&#946;42 degradation, the study provides implications of a possible role of Tyr10 O&#8208;glycan in regulating A&#946; clearance in the brain.

         <title>Differentiating the Substrate Profiles of Inflammatory Caspases Using Extended F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer&#8208;Based Peptide Substrates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inflammatory caspases are key players in the innate immune response. Their specificity profiles are investigated using F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer peptide&#8208;based assays, allowing for incorporation of amino acids on both sides of the cleaved aspartic acid residue. Structural analyses led to the conclusion that having an amino acid on the prime side allows the substrate to adopt a different conformation than without it there.

Human inflammatory caspases (caspase&#8208;1, &#8208;4, and &#8208;5) are key players in the innate immune response. These enzymes have been shown to cleave proinflammatory substrates, implicating them in many inflammatory disease states. Their activity is frequently assessed using in&#8201;vitro fluorogenic assays, with all three human inflammatory caspases preferring the same WEHD tetrapeptide. The study examines the specificity of these enzymes C&#8208;terminal to the cleaved aspartate residue with F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer peptide&#8208;based assays using 7&#8208;methoxycoumaryl alanine [A(MCA)] as the donor and lysine&#8208;conjugated dabsyl [K(Dab)] as the quencher. The P4&#8211;P1 peptide sequences A(MCA)EHD, A(MCA)VAD, and A(MCA)QPD are varied on the C&#8208;terminal (prime) side of the peptide. Historically, caspase&#8208;4 and caspase&#8208;5 have been grouped together in their reactivity. Herein, caspase&#8208;5 only appreciably cleaves the A(MCA)EHDGK(Dab) peptide, whereas caspase&#8208;4 displays broader reactivity. All base sequences react more considerably with caspase&#8208;4 when a glycine is included C&#8208;terminal to Asp. The specificity of caspase&#8208;1 at this position varies based on the P3&#8211;P1 sequence of the peptide. These results highlight the interconnectedness of the prime and nonprime side amino acid sequences and the different behavior of each enzyme, which can be useful in understanding these potential drug targets.

         <title>Human Protein Z as the Second Known Heme&#8208;Binding Protein from the Endogenous Blood Coagulation Inhibitor System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein Z is a vitamin K&#8208;dependent anticoagulant with elusive molecular functions. Herein, it is shown that heme binds to protein Z and induces conformational changes. One histidine&#8208;based heme&#8208;binding motif is identified. High heme&#8208;binding affinity and functional effects are demonstrated on protein level. These findings shed new light on the structural and functional roles of protein Z in hemolysis&#8208;driven coagulation disorders.

Protein Z (PZ) is a vitamin&#8208;K&#8208;dependent glycoprotein that serves as an anticoagulant cofactor in blood. Although it is homologous to the serine proteases of blood coagulation, PZ has no enzymatic activity. It binds to the PZ&#8208;dependent protease inhibitor and supports inactivation of factor Xa. In addition, an inhibitory effect on thrombin is described. Clinically, changed PZ levels increase the risk for thrombosis. The related activated protein C (APC) is described as the first anticoagulant protein that binds heme under hemolytic conditions leading to its inhibition. However, the network of inhibitors of blood coagulation is still underexplored with respect to their role in heme&#8208;triggered effects and the regulation thereof. PZ seems to be an interesting candidate in this context due to its homology to APC. Using PZ&#8208;derived peptides as models for potential heme&#8208;binding sites in PZ together with in silico studies, one specific heme&#8208;binding site in PZ is identified. Binding studies on protein level demonstrate binding characteristics similar to APC. Finally, the inhibitory effect of PZ toward thrombin is increased in the presence of heme, providing also insights into a potential functional consequence of the PZ&#8211;heme interaction. In addition, the anticoagulant function of PZ is dampened in the presence of heme in an aPTT&#8208;based clotting assay, suggesting a tendency toward heme&#8208;induced prothrombotic actions. In future, this will support mapping the diverse effects of heme within blood coagulation.

         <title>Exploring the Substitution of the C21&#8208;OAc Moiety in [11]Cytochalasans: Synthesis and Evaluation of Fluorophore Conjugates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via in&#8201;silico docking of pyrichalasin H on G&#8208; and F&#8208;actin, the C21&#8208;OAc moiety is identified as a modifiable site tolerated for actin binding. Fluorescent [11]cytochalasan probes from pyrichalasin H and epoxycytochalasin C are obtained by selective C21&#8208;OAc hydrolysis and acylation. The conjugates retain actin binding and bioactivity, establishing C21&#8208;OAc as a versatile handle for functionalization.

The actin cytoskeleton plays a central role in cellular organization and dynamics, yet the tools available for targeting actin function remain limited. Cytochalasans represent a large class of actin&#8208;targeting natural products that are readily cell permeable with varying cytotoxicity and actin&#8208;targeting capabilities in mammalian cells. Their pharmacologic exploitation not only requires an understanding of their mode of action but also exact knowledge of how they can be derivatized without affecting their bioactivity. Herein, the design, synthesis, and evaluation of five fluorescently labeled [11]cytochalasan derivatives generated from pyrichalasin H (PyriH) and 19,20&#8208;epoxycytochalasin C (EpoxyCytoC) are reported. Guided by molecular docking, the C21&#8208;OAc moiety is identified as a promising site for tag attachment without disrupting actin binding. Semisynthetic modifications enable the conjugation of different dyes to PyriH and EpoxyCytoC scaffolds. Moreover, the effect of linkers separating cytochalasans and dyes is analyzed. Biological evaluation supplemented by in&#8201;vitro assays to additionally interrogates their activities on the assembly of pure actin filaments revealing distinct activity profiles. Together, this study compares permeability, cytotoxicity, and actin binding of five novel [11]cytochalasan probes bearing substitutions of the C21&#8208;OAc moiety. These findings establish the C21&#8208;OAc position as a versatile functionalization site and provide a framework for developing next generation cytochalasan&#8208;based actin&#8208;targeting probes.

         <title>Nanomolar Affinity Host&#8208;Dye Reporter Pairs from Fluorescently Labeled Oligoarginine Peptides and p&#8208;Sulfonatocalix[4]arene</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dependence of the binding affinity of oligoarginine peptides to p&#8208;sulfonatocalix[4]arene (CX4) on peptide length, C&#8208;terminal functionality, and fluorescent labeling is reported. The fluorescent peptides can be excited in the visible range with common lasers and show nanomolar affinity and efficient quenching upon CX4 binding, which enables their use as modular host&#8208;dye reporter pairs for peptide sensing.

Oligoarginine peptides are of interest as cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) and play important roles in gene regulation and immune response. Complexation of oligoarginine peptides by the supramolecular host p&#8208;sulfonatocalix[4]arene (CX4) is well&#8208;established and has led to the use of CX4 derivatives as effective counterion activators for arginine&#8208;rich CPPs and to the application of CX4 in peptide sensing. Herein, a systematic binding study between oligoarginine peptides with CX4 is reported. The results show that the binding affinity increases with increasing peptide length from &#8776;104&#8201;M&#8211;1 for the peptide H&#8208;Arg&#8208;Arg&#8208;OH to nanomolar affinities for peptides with more than four arginine residues. Within the series, C&#8208;terminal carboxamides show higher affinities than the respective carboxylates. In addition, the influence of fluorescent dye labeling is investigated with sulforhodamine B (SRB) and fluorescein (FL) dye labels. Efficient fluorescent quenching is observed after complexation of the labeled peptides by CX4, which prompted the exploration of the complexes as reporter pairs for chemosensing applications. The results suggest that the combination of fluorescently labeled oligoarginine peptides with CX4 affords a modular platform of host&#8208;dye reporter pairs for the detection of polycationic peptides with tailorable excitation and emission wavelengths and tailorable binding affinity down to the nanomolar affinity range.

         <title>Alteration of CD40 Protein Expression by Tyrosine Phosphorylation of the NF&#8208;&#954;B p50 Subunit</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategy for incorporation of phosphorylated tyrosine into the p50 subunit of human NF&#8208;&#954;B.

Protein phosphorylation is critical to selective gene expression; the proteins that regulate transcription are often phosphorylated at multiple sites. Serine and threonine phosphorylation in transcription factors such as NF&#8208;&#954;B has been studied, and specific serines are involved in transcriptional activation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of NF&#8208;&#954;B p50 subunit can also facilitate the NF&#8208;&#954;B&#8208;mediated expression of CD40 protein. This study seeks to determine whether tyrosine phosphorylations at positions not normally phosphorylated in vivo could nonetheless affect protein expression mediated by NF&#8208;&#954;B. The alterations studied included p50 analogs having pTyr at positions 59 and 61, which do not contain Tyr naturally, and an analog containing a metabolically stable tyrosine methylene phosphonate at position 60. Additionally, to explore the structural basis for enhanced NF&#8208;&#954;B binding to CD40 promoter DNA by tyrosine phosphorylation, an analog of NF&#8208;&#954;B p50 containing pTyr at both positions 60 and 82 is prepared. The results reflected changes in the ability of the modified NF&#8208;&#954;Bs containing an altered p50 subunit to bind to CD40 promoter DNA in vitro, and to direct the synthesis of CD40 in cellulo.

         <title>Multifaceted Effects of a Multiple Nitric Oxide Photoreleaser and its Photoproducts on Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Aggregation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A blue light&#8208;activatable NO photodonor sequentially releases two NO molecules accompanied by two stable photoproducts, showing differentiated effects on the &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation.

Aberrant aggregation of &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) peptides into insoluble fibrils is recognized as one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among the post&#8208;translational modifications influencing A&#946; behavior, nitration and nitrosation by nitric oxide (NO) derivatives play a key role, though their impact on aggregation and toxicity remains unclear. This contribution explores the effects on A&#946; aggregation induced by an NO photodonor (NOPD) releasing two NO molecules via a stepwise mechanism under the control of visible blue light. Significant reduction of protein aggregation is observed when a considerable amount NO (&#8776;120&#8201;&#181;M) is photoreleased during the early stages of the protein aggregation. In contrast, long&#8208;term release of a similar NO concentration is ineffective. On the other hand, proaggregative effect is induced by the NOPD kept in the dark. The stable photoproducts formed after the release of the first and the second molecule of NO also show a protein aggregation inhibitory effect both individually and in combination. Dynamic simulation studies are also reported to shed light on the binding of NOPD and its photoproducts with key A&#946;1&#8211;40 residues.

         <title>From Structure to Function: Development of Relaxin&#8208;3 Analogs and their Role in RXFP3 Signaling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines the current understanding of the relaxin&#8208;3/the relaxin family peptide receptor 3 (RXFP3) system and recent developments in peptidomimetics and small&#8208;molecule ligands targeting the system.

Relaxin&#8208;3 is a two&#8208;chain neuropeptide of the insulin/relaxin superfamily and the cognate ligand for the G protein&#8208;coupled receptor RXFP3. Since its discovery, the relaxin&#8208;3/RXFP3 signaling system has emerged as a key regulator of feeding behavior, stress responses, arousal, addiction, and cognitive function. Recent structural studies, including the first cryo&#8208;electron microscopy structures of RXFP3 bound to relaxin&#8208;3 and small molecules, have provided significant insights into ligand&#8211;receptor interactions. Together with mutagenesis and pharmacological studies, these advances have facilitated the design of diverse RXFP3 ligands, ranging from simplified and/or stapled single&#8208;chain analogs of relaxin&#8208;3 to grafted scaffolds and small&#8208;molecule modulators. Such tools have been instrumental for probing relaxin&#8208;3 biology in&#8201;vivo and highlight the system's therapeutic potential for treating anxiety, depression, obesity, binge eating, and alcohol use disorder. However, challenges remain, particularly regarding blood&#8211;brain barrier penetration, receptor subtype selectivity, pharmacokinetic optimization, and safe long&#8208;term modulation. This review summarizes current knowledge of relaxin&#8208;3 structure, receptor interactions, and pharmacology and highlights how advances in peptide chemistry, structural biology, and small&#8208;molecule design are enabling the rational development of RXFP3&#8208;targeted therapeutics.

Together with mutagenesis and pharmacological studies, these advances have facilitated the design of diverse RXFP3 ligands, ranging from simplified and/or stapled single-chain analogs of relaxin-3 to grafted scaffolds and small-molecule modulators. Such tools have been instrumental for probing relaxin-3 biology in&#8201;vivo and highlight the system's therapeutic potential for treating anxiety, depression, obesity, binge eating, and alcohol use disorder. However, challenges remain, particularly regarding blood&#8211;brain barrier penetration, receptor subtype selectivity, pharmacokinetic optimization, and safe long-term modulation. This review summarizes current knowledge of relaxin-3 structure, receptor interactions, and pharmacology and highlights how advances in peptide chemistry, structural biology, and small-molecule design are enabling the rational development of RXFP3-targeted therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Ultra&#8208;Fast Duplex Invasion Targeting Long&#8208;Range Double&#8208;Stranded DNA Using Artificial Nucleotide</title>

Photo&#8208;induced ultra&#8208;fast duplex invasion via ultra&#8208;fast photo&#8208;crosslinker, 3&#8208;cyanovinylcarbazole nucleoside (CNVK), aiming for fast high&#8208;efficiency invasion.

Genomic DNA stores genetic information and regulates functions of various biological processes. Genetic diseases can be caused by abnormal gene expression. Genetic manipulation requires sequence&#8208;selective recognition of double&#8208;stranded DNAs, various chemical approaches for double&#8208;duplex invasion have been developed. In the previous research, a photo&#8208;induced double&#8208;duplex invasion (pDDI) is introduced that uses artificial nucleotides, 3&#8208;cyanovinylcarbazole nucleoside (CNVK) as photo&#8208;crosslinker and 5&#8208;cyanouridine (CU) as inter&#8208;probe photo&#8208;crosslinking inhibitor. In this study, while investigating the invasion mechanism of the pDDI, the invasion independence of pDDI probes is discovered and proposed a photo&#8208;induced duplex invasion (pDI) that achieves fast invasion using only CNVK while still maintaining a high invasion efficiency. This rapid pDI approach provides a powerful new tool for site&#8208;specific manipulation of genomic DNA.

         <title>From Molecule to Meaning: Click and Bioorthogonal Chemical Reporters for Plant Systems, Biological Imaging, and Artistic Expression</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
At the intersection of chemical biology, plant imaging, and contemporary art, this review introduces the concept of chembioart. By tracing how chemical reporters illuminate plant biomolecules in vivo, their role not only in advancing scientific understanding but also in inspiring transdisciplinary collaborations and visual expression&#160;is highlighted.

Chemical biology has reshaped the ability to investigate complex biological systems at the molecular level. In this context, chemical reporters have become important tools for labeling and tracking biomolecules in living systems with spatial and temporal precision. In plant biology, they provide an alternative to genetic approaches and allow the study of dynamic processes in species or organs that are not easily accessible. Through the use of click and bioorthogonal chemistry, small&#8208;molecule probes can be metabolically incorporated into specific molecular scaffolds such as sugars, monolignols, amino acids, and lipids. These probes make it possible to follow events like glycosylation, lignification, lipid turnover, or protein synthesis in living plant tissues. This review presents an overview of current chemical reporter strategies, from molecular design and synthetic considerations to their application in plant imaging. Herein, how these tools have contributed to the development of plant chemical biology by enabling precise and modular investigations of plant structure and metabolism is described. Herein, it is also examined how chemical reporters have entered interdisciplinary contexts, including collaborations between science and the arts. By converting molecular&#8208;level information into visual and sensory formats, these approaches open new perspectives for research, education, and communication across scientific and creative disciplines.
