         <title>A bi&#8208;enzymatic cascade pathway towards optically pure FAHFAs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently discovered endogenous mammalian lipids fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs), proved to have anti&#8208;inflammatory and anti&#8208;diabetic effects. Due to their extremely low abundancies in vivo , forging a feasible scenario for FAHFA synthesis is critical for their use in uncovering biological mechanism or clinical trials. Here, we showcase a fully enzymatic approach, a novel in vitro bi&#8208;enzymatic cascade system, enabling an effective conversion of nature&#8208;abundant fatty acids into FAHFAs. Two hydratases from L. acidophilus were used for converting unsaturated fatty acids to various enantiomeric hydroxy fatty acids, followed by esterification with another fatty acid catalyzed by C. antarctica lipase A (CALA). Various FAHFAs were synthesized in a semi&#8208;preparative scale using this bi&#8208;enzymatic approach in a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step operation mode. In all, we demonstrate that hydratase&#8208;CALA system offers a promising route for synthesis of optically pure structure&#8208;diverse FAHFAs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Reconstructed Common Ancestor of the Fatty Acid Photo&#8208;decarboxylase Clade Shows Photo&#8208;decarboxylation Activity and Increased Thermostability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme resurrection strikes again: Ancestral sequence reconstruction was applied to a putative photo&#8208;decarboxylases clade. One common ancestor showed up to 12&#8208;fold production yield, a 15&#8201;&#176;C increase in thermostability and up to 20&#8208;fold improvement in residual activity when incubated at 50&#8201;&#176;C. Ancestral sequence reconstruction proved to be a valuable tool to introduce valid mutations to a little understood fatty acid photo&#8208;decarboxylase.







Abstract
Light&#8208;dependent enzymes are a rare type of biocatalyst with high potential for research and biotechnology. A recently discovered fatty acid photo&#8208;decarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis NC64A (CvFAP) converts fatty acids to the corresponding hydrocarbons only when irradiated with blue light (400 to 520&#8197;nm). To expand the available catalytic diversity for fatty acid decarboxylation, we reconstructed possible ancestral decarboxylases from a set of 12 extant sequences that were classified under the fatty acid decarboxylases clade within the glucose&#8208;methanol choline (GMC) oxidoreductase family. One of the resurrected enzymes (ANC1) showed activity in the decarboxylation of fatty acids, showing that the clade indeed contains several photo&#8208;decarboxylases. ANC1 has a 15&#8201;&#176;C higher melting temperature (Tm) than the extant CvFAP. Its production yielded 12&#8208;fold more protein than this wild type decarboxylase, which offers practical advantages for the biochemical investigation of this photoenzyme. Homology modelling revealed amino acid substitutions to more hydrophilic residues at the surface and shorter flexible loops compared to the wild type. Using ancestral sequence reconstruction, we have expanded the existing pool of confirmed fatty acid photo&#8208;decarboxylases, providing access to a more robust catalyst for further development via directed evolution.

         <title>Biochemical Investigation of the Interaction of pICln, RioK1 and COPR5 with the PRMT5&#8211;MEP50 Complex</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Determination of a PPI interface: The adaptor protein binding site of PRMT5 has been identified and studied by using synthetic peptides. A cocrystal structure of the PRMT5 TIM&#8208;barrel domain and a RioK1&#8208;derived peptide highlights the site of interaction.







Abstract
The PRMT5&#8211;MEP50 methyltransferase complex plays a key role in various cancers and is regulated by different protein&#8211;protein interactions. Several proteins have been reported to act as adaptor proteins that recruit substrate proteins to the active site of PRMT5 for the methylation of arginine residues. To define the interaction between these adaptor proteins and PRMT5, we employed peptide truncation and mutation studies and prepared truncated protein constructs. We report the characterisation of the interface between the TIM barrel of PRMT5 and the adaptor proteins pICln, RioK1 and COPR5, and identify the consensus amino acid sequence GQF[D/E]DA[E/D] involved in binding. Protein crystallography revealed that the RioK1 derived peptide interacts with a novel PPI site.

         <title>Biohybrid Systems for Improved Bioinspired, Energy&#8208;Relevant Catalysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ranging from small&#8208;molecule metal complexes to supramolecular assembles, bioinspired catalysts possess many exciting properties that could address salient challenges in industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing. Inspired by natural enzymes, these systems have high activity, enantioselectivity, and aqueous solubility. Recent advances in synthetic enzyme models have improved our understanding of complicated biological enzymatic processes and enabled the production of catalysts with increased efficiency.







Abstract
Biomimetic catalysts, ranging from small&#8208;molecule metal complexes to supramolecular assembles, possess many exciting properties that could address salient challenges in industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing. Inspired by natural enzymes, these biohybrid catalytic systems demonstrate superior characteristics, including high activity, enantioselectivity, and enhanced aqueous solubility, over their fully synthetic counterparts. However, instability and limitations in the prediction of structure&#8208;function relationships are major drawbacks that often prevent the application of biomimetic catalysts outside of the laboratory. Despite these obstacles, recent advances in synthetic enzyme models have improved our understanding of complicated biological enzymatic processes and enabled the production of catalysts with increased efficiency. This review outlines important developments and future prospects for the design and application of bioinspired and biohybrid systems at multiple length scales for important, biologically relevant, clean energy transformations.

         <title>Chemical Biology Tools To Investigate Malaria Parasites</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ghost hunting: Malaria tropica has been haunting mankind for centuries, but investigating the biology of the causative agent, the protozoan parasite P. falciparum, remains challenging. Herein, we describe ready&#8208;to&#8208;use, non&#8208;genetic, small molecular probes from the field of chemical biology that have been, or may be, used to interrogate the complex infection cycle, with an emphasis on infected red blood cells.







Abstract
Parasitic diseases like malaria tropica have been shaping human evolution and history since the beginning of mankind. After infection, the response of the human host ranges from asymptomatic to severe and may culminate in death. Therefore, proper examination of the parasite's biology is pivotal to deciphering unique molecular, biochemical and cell biological processes, which in turn ensure the identification of treatment strategies, such as potent drug targets and vaccine candidates. However, implementing molecular biology methods for genetic manipulation proves to be difficult for many parasite model organisms. The development of fast and straightforward applicable alternatives, for instance small&#8208;molecule probes from the field of chemical biology, is essential. In this review, we will recapitulate the highlights of previous molecular and chemical biology approaches that have already created insight and understanding of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. We discuss current developments from the field of chemical biology and explore how their application could advance research into this parasite in the future. We anticipate that the described approaches will help to close knowledge gaps in the biology of P. falciparum and we hope that researchers will be inspired to use these methods to gain knowledge &#8211; with the aim of ending this devastating disease.

         <title>Optimized Biocatalytic Synthesis of 2&#8208;Selenopyrimidine Nucleosides by Transglycosylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Se for yourself: We present a biocatalytic synthesis of selenium&#8208;containing pyrimidine nucleosides. Optimization of the reaction conditions improved the solubility and stability of the sensitive starting materials as well as previously observed low conversions. This approach offers a concise alternative to traditionally employed multistep routes to these compounds.







Abstract
Selenium&#8208;modified nucleosides are powerful tools to study the structure and function of nucleic acids and their protein interactions. The widespread application of 2&#8208;selenopyrimidine nucleosides is currently limited by low yields in established synthetic routes. Herein, we describe the optimization of the synthesis of 2&#8208;Se&#8208;uridine and 2&#8208;Se&#8208;thymidine derivatives by thermostable nucleoside phosphorylases in transglycosylation reactions using natural uridine or thymidine as sugar donors. Reactions were performed at 60 or 80&#8201;&#176;C and at pH&#8197;9 under hypoxic conditions to improve the solubility and stability of the 2&#8208;Se&#8208;nucleobases in aqueous media. To optimize the conversion, the reaction equilibria in analytical transglycosylation reactions were studied. The equilibrium constants of phosphorolysis of the 2&#8208;Se&#8208;pyrimidines were between 5 and 10, and therefore differ by an order of magnitude from the equilibrium constants of any other known case. Hence, the thermodynamic properties of the target nucleosides are inherently unfavorable, and this complicates their synthesis significantly. A tenfold excess of sugar donor was needed to achieve 40&#8722;48&#8201;% conversion to the target nucleoside. Scale&#8208;up of the optimized conditions provided four Se&#8208;containing nucleosides in 6&#8211;40&#8201;% isolated yield, which compares favorably to established chemical routes.

         <title>Manufacture of Multilayered Artificial Cell Membranes through Sequential Bilayer Deposition on Emulsion Templates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Running rings around vesicles: We describe a droplet&#8208;based technology to manufacture cell&#8208;sized multilamellar lipid vesicles. Individual membranes are assembled layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer, giving control over the number of induvial layers and their molecular content. We investigated how the biomechanical properties of the structures change with each added layer.







Abstract
Efforts to manufacture artificial cells that replicate the architectures, processes and behaviours of biological cells are rapidly increasing. Perhaps the most commonly reconstructed cellular structure is the membrane, through the use of unilamellar vesicles as models. However, many cellular membranes, including bacterial double membranes, nuclear envelopes, and organelle membranes, are multilamellar. Due to a lack of technologies available for their controlled construction, multilayered membranes are not part of the repertoire of cell&#8208;mimetic motifs used in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. To address this, we developed emulsion&#8208;based technologies that allow cell&#8208;sized multilayered vesicles to be produced layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer, with compositional control over each layer, thus enabling studies that would otherwise remain inaccessible. We discovered that bending rigidities scale with the number of layers and demonstrate inter&#8208;bilayer registration between coexisting liquid&#8211;liquid domains. These technologies will contribute to the exploitation of multilayered membrane structures, paving the way for incorporating protein complexes that span multiple bilayers.

         <title>A comparison of two DNA aptamers for dopamine using homogeneous binding assays</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter and its detection is important for bioanalytical chemistry. Two very different DNA aptamers have been reported for dopamine, one derived from an RNA aptamer (named Apt1) and other obtained via direct aptamer selection (named Apt2). In this study, we used four homogeneous binding assays to compare these two DNA dopamine aptamers. Thiazole orange (TO) fluorescence assay indicated that the Apt2 specifically bound with dopamine with a  K  d  of 2.37 &#181;M, which was consistent with that from the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assay. However, Apt1 had much less TO fluorescence change and also no signal from ITC. By labeling the two ends of the two aptamers by a fluorophore and a quencher, the aptamer beacons showed binding of dopamine only for Apt2. Finally, the label&#8208;free AuNP&#8208;based colorimetric assay showed no difference between these two aptamer sequences, and even non&#8208;binding random DNA showed the same response, indicating the AuNPs were not a good probe for detecting dopamine. Taken the data together, Apt1 does not appear to be able to bind dopamine specifically, while Apt2 showed specific binding and is recommended for developing related biosensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Similar but Still Different: Which Amino Acid Residues Are Responsible for Varying Activities in Type&#8208;III Copper Enzymes?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Type&#8208;III copper proteins are ubiquitous among organisms and catalyze the transfer and activation of molecular oxygen. Tyrosinases hydroxylate monophenols and oxidize the corresponding diphenols, whereas catechol oxidases have only the latter activity. The substrate preference of the two subgroups is controlled by amino acids around the two copper ions, which guide the similar type&#8208;III copper centers into different catalytic pathways. The produced quinones polymerize to melanins, resulting in the browning of fruits and human skin, hair, and eye color. More information can be found in the minireview by I. Kampatsikas and A. Rompel et&#8197;al.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Antibody Fragment Conjugates for Reversible Staining in Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To get one step closer to making fluorescence microscopy as easy as filling out shapes in a children's coloring book, we have developed a novel strategy for generating DNA&#8208; and PNA&#8208;based protein oligonucleotides. We use a chemo&#8208;enzymatic, click chemistry&#8211;based approach via the TubTag to generate our conjugates as depicted in the magnifying glass. Those proteins can readily be used to &#8220;paint&#8221; our cell for fluorescence microscopy. More information can be found in the communication by A. Stengl et&#8197;al. Cover design: J. Schwach.

         <title>Advanced Understanding of the Electron&#8208;Transfer Pathway of Cytochrome P450s</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The landmark building of our school is the place where we started to solve the first full&#8208;length crystal structure of a self&#8208;sufficient cytochrome P450 (CYP116B46). The building has three main parts that are in an alignment similar to that of the three&#8208;domain CYP116B46. Cytochrome P450s are powerful biocatalysts with potential in many biotechnological applications. The majority of P450s demand redox equivalents that travel from pyridine nucleotides through the electron&#8208;transfer path to the catalytic center, like the lightning descending. In our review, we summarize the current understanding of the P450 electron&#8208;transfer route, with particular focus on the recently reported structures of two types of self&#8208;sufficient P450s. This information should provide important insights into the P450 mechanism studies and engineering. More information can be found in the review by X. Yu, R.&#8208;T. Guo, et&#8197;al.

         <title>Probes for Photoaffinity Labelling of Kinases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light up the kinome. Probes for photoaffinity labelling of kinases are powerful research tools for detecting (off&#8208;)targets of kinase inhibitors, imaging kinases within the cell or identifying binding partners. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the currently available kinase photoaffinity probes and discuss how such probes are designed. We illustrate the applicability with various examples.







Abstract
Protein kinases, one of the largest enzyme superfamilies, regulate many physiological and pathological processes. They are drug targets for multiple human diseases, including various cancer types. Probes for the photoaffinity labelling of kinases are important research tools for the study of members of this enzyme superfamily. In this review, we discuss the design principles of these probes, which are mainly derived from inhibitors targeting the ATP pocket. Overall, insights from crystal structures guide the placement of photoreactive groups and detection tags. This has resulted in a wide variety of probes, of which we provide a comprehensive overview. We also discuss several areas of application of these probes, including the identification of targets and off&#8208;targets of kinase inhibitors, mapping of their binding sites, the development of inhibitor screening assays, the imaging of kinases, and identification of protein binding partners.

         <title>A Mutation&#8208;based Method for Pinpointing a DNA N6&#8208;methyladenine Methyltransferase&#8217;s Modification Site at Single Base Resolution</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA  N  6  &#8208;methyladenine (6mA) has recently received notable attention due to an increased finding of its functional roles in higher eukaryotes. Here we report an enzyme&#8208;assisted chemical labeling method to pinpoint the DNA 6mA MTase&#8217;s substrate modification site at single base resolution. A designed allyl&#8208;substituted MTase cofactor was applied in the catalytic transfer reaction, and the allyl group was installed to the  N  6  &#8208;position of adenine within a specific DNA sequence to form  N  6  &#8208;allyladenine (6aA). The iodination of 6aA allyl group induced the formation of 1,  N  6  &#8208;cyclized adenine which caused mutations during DNA replication by a certain polymerase, and thus the modification site could be precisely detected by a mutation signal. We synthesized 6aA deoxynucleoside and deoxynucleotide model compounds and a 6aA&#8208;containing DNA probe, and screened nine DNA polymerases to eventually work out an optimal system capable of detecting the substrate modification site of a DNA 6mA MTase at single base resolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsic Fluorescence of the Active and the Inactive Functional Forms of Human Thymidylate Synthase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A matter of form: The active and the inactive functional forms of human thymidylate synthase, a long&#8208;known anticancer target, exhibit different intrinsic fluorescence spectra, quantum yields, lifetime profiles and anisotropies. These differences are connected to the conformational changes occurring in the active &#8211; inactive interconversion and provide tools for real&#8208;time identification and quantitation of the two protein forms in solution.







Abstract
The observables associated with protein intrinsic fluorescence &#8211; spectra, time decays, anisotropies &#8211; offer opportunities to monitor in real time and non&#8208;invasively a protein&#8216;s functional form and its interchange with other forms with different functions. We employed these observables to sketch the fluorometric profiles of two functional forms of human thymidylate synthase (hTS), a homodimeric enzyme crucial for cell proliferation and thus targeted by anticancer drugs. The protein takes an active and an inactive form. Stabilization of the latter by peptides that, unlike classical hTS inhibitors, bind it at the monomer/monomer interface offers an alternative inhibition mechanism that promises to avoid the onset of drug resistance in anticancer therapy. The fluorescence features depicted herein can be used as tools to identify and quantify each of the two protein forms in solution, thus making it possible to investigate the kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of the active/inactive conformational interchange. Two examples of fluorometrically monitored interconversion kinetics are provided.

         <title>Approaches to Evaluate the Impact of a Small&#8208;Molecule Binder to a Noncatalytic Site of the Proteasome</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigating the impact of small molecules: There are a number of essential protein&#8211;protein interactions between the 19S regulatory particle and 20S core particle to form the full 26S proteasome. We investigated whether a small&#8208;molecule binder to Rpn&#8208;6, a 19S subunit, could disrupt 26S proteasome activity.







Abstract
Proteasome activity is crucial for cell survival and proliferation. In recent years, small molecules have been discovered that can affect the catalytic activity of the proteasome. Rather than targeting the active sites of the proteasome, it might be possible to affect ubiquitin&#8208;dependent degradation of proteins by limiting the association of the 19S regulatory particle (19S RP) with the 20S core particle (20S CP) of the proteasome. We recently described the discovery of TXS&#8208;8, a peptoid that binds to Rpn&#8208;6. Rpn&#8208;6 is a proteasome&#8208;associated protein that makes critical contacts with the 19S RP and the 20S CP. Herein, we present a general workflow to evaluate the impact of a small&#8208;molecule binder on proteasome activity by using TXS&#8208;8 as an example. This workflow contains three steps in which specific probes or overexpressed proteins in cells are used to determine whether the hydrolysis activity of the proteasome is affected. Although, in our case, TXS&#8208;8 did not affect proteasome activity, our workflow is highly amenable to studying a variety of small&#8208;molecule&#8211;proteasome subunit interactions.

         <title>Application of Neuron&#8208;Selective Fluorescent Probe, NeuA, To Identify Mouse Retinal Degeneration</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As far as the eye can be seen: Developed fluorescent probe, NeuA (NeuO with an acrylamide group), stained healthy mouse retinal neuron cells and discriminated between healthy retina and retina with degenerating photoreceptors by confocal and fluorescent fundus microscopy. These imaging probes can be used as diagnostic and prognostic tools for retinitis pigmentosa in a clinical domain.







Abstract
The retina is part of the central nerve system (CNS) and has various interneurons and sensory neurons such as photoreceptor cells. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited condition that is characterized by photoreceptor degeneration. Herein, we developed a fluorescent probe&#8208;NeuA&#8208;for detecting retinal neuronal cells and applied NeuA to discriminate between healthy and RP retinas. The staining pattern of NeuA in the retinas of healthy and RP mouse models was examined in&#8197;vitro, ex vivo and in&#8197;vivo using confocal microscopy, the fluorescent fundus microscopy and optical coherent tomography (OCT). NeuA strongly stained the outer segment layer of photoreceptor cells and some bipolar cells in the healthy retina, but there was only weak staining in the photoreceptor degenerated retinas. Therefore, NeuA probe can be used as the detecting RP tools in the preclinical conditions.

         <title>Isopenicillin&#8197;N Synthase: Crystallographic Studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thousand words: Isopenicillin&#8197;N synthase drives the central step in penicillin biosynthesis, oxidative cyclisation of a linear tripeptide to form the bicyclic &#946;&#8208;lactam core. Crystal structures of the protein with its substrate, product, trapped reaction intermediates, and diverse substrate analogues paint a rich mechanistic picture of the enzyme in action and deepen our understanding of non&#8208;heme iron enzyme catalysis.







Abstract
Isopenicillin&#8197;N synthase (IPNS) is a non&#8208;heme iron oxidase (NHIO) that catalyses the cyclisation of tripeptide &#948;&#8208;(l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminoadipoyl)&#8208;l&#8208;cysteinyl&#8208;d&#8208;valine (ACV) to bicyclic isopenicillin&#8197;N (IPN). Over the last 25&#8197;years, crystallography has shed considerable light on the mechanism of IPNS catalysis. The first crystal structure, for apo&#8208;IPNS with Mn bound in place of Fe at the active site, reported in 1995, was also the first structure for a member of the wider NHIO family. This was followed by the anaerobic enzyme&#8208;substrate complex IPNS&#8722;Fe&#8722;ACV (1997), this complex plus nitric oxide as a surrogate for co&#8208;substrate dioxygen (1997), and an enzyme product complex (1999). Since then, crystallography has been used to probe many aspects of the IPNS reaction mechanism, by crystallising the protein with a diversity of substrate analogues and triggering the oxidative reaction by using elevated oxygen pressures to force the gaseous co&#8208;substrate throughout protein crystals and maximise synchronicity of turnover in crystallo. In this way, X&#8208;ray structures have been elucidated for a range of complexes closely related to and/or directly derived from key intermediates in the catalytic cycle, thereby answering numerous mechanistic questions that had arisen from solution&#8208;phase experiments, and posing many new ones. The results of these crystallographic studies have, in turn, informed computational experiments that have brought further insight. These combined crystallographic and computational investigations augment and extend the results of earlier spectroscopic analyses and solution phase studies of IPNS turnover, to enrich our understanding of this important protein and the wider NHIO enzyme family.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A thousand words&lt;/b&gt;: Isopenicillin&#8197;N synthase drives the central step in penicillin biosynthesis, oxidative cyclisation of a linear tripeptide to form the bicyclic &#946;&#8208;lactam core. Crystal structures of the protein with its substrate, product, trapped reaction intermediates, and diverse substrate analogues paint a rich mechanistic picture of the enzyme in action and deepen our understanding of non&#8208;heme iron enzyme catalysis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isopenicillin&#8197;N synthase (IPNS) is a non&#8208;heme iron oxidase (NHIO) that catalyses the cyclisation of tripeptide &#948;&#8208;(&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminoadipoyl)&#8208;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;cysteinyl&#8208;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;valine (ACV) to bicyclic isopenicillin&#8197;N (IPN). Over the last 25&#8197;years, crystallography has shed considerable light on the mechanism of IPNS catalysis. The first crystal structure, for apo&#8208;IPNS with Mn bound in place of Fe at the active site, reported in 1995, was also the first structure for a member of the wider NHIO family. This was followed by the anaerobic enzyme&#8208;substrate complex IPNS&#8722;Fe&#8722;ACV (1997), this complex plus nitric oxide as a surrogate for co&#8208;substrate dioxygen (1997), and an enzyme product complex (1999). Since then, crystallography has been used to probe many aspects of the IPNS reaction mechanism, by crystallising the protein with a diversity of substrate analogues and triggering the oxidative reaction by using elevated oxygen pressures to force the gaseous co&#8208;substrate throughout protein crystals and maximise synchronicity of turnover &lt;i&gt;in crystallo&lt;/i&gt;. In this way, X&#8208;ray structures have been elucidated for a range of complexes closely related to and/or directly derived from key intermediates in the catalytic cycle, thereby answering numerous mechanistic questions that had arisen from solution&#8208;phase experiments, and posing many new ones. The results of these crystallographic studies have, in turn, informed computational experiments that have brought further insight. These combined crystallographic and computational investigations augment and extend the results of earlier spectroscopic analyses and solution phase studies of IPNS turnover, to enrich our understanding of this important protein and the wider NHIO enzyme family.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Exchange of Proteins in Liposomes through Streptolysin O Pores</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking a pore view of bioreactors: Streptolysin O creates pores in liposome membranes allowing proteins to permeate them. Enzymes including RNA polymerase can be supplied through these pores, allowing RNA to be synthesized in liposomes. The method could broaden the application of liposomes as biochemical reactors.







Abstract
Liposomes, which are vesicles surrounded by lipid membranes, can be used as biochemical reactors by encapsulating various reactions. Accordingly, they are useful for studying cellular functions under controlled conditions that mimic the environment within a cell. However, one of the shortcomings of liposomes as biochemical reactors is the difficulty of introducing or removing proteins due to the impermeability of the membrane. In this study, we established a method for exchanging proteins in liposomes by forming reversible pores in the membrane. We used the toxic protein streptolysin O (SLO); this forms pores in membranes made of phospholipids containing cholesterol that can be closed by the addition of calcium ions. After optimizing the experimental procedure and lipid composition, we observed the exchange of fluorescent proteins (transferrin Alexa Fluor 488 and 647) in 9.9&#8201;% of liposomes. We also introduced T7 RNA polymerase, a 98&#8208;kDa enzyme, and observed RNA synthesis in &#8764;8&#8201;% of liposomes. Our findings establish a new method for controlling the internal protein composition of liposomes, thereby increasing their utility as bioreactors.

         <title>Increased valency improves inhibitory activity of peptides targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a clinically validated target for treating hypercholesterolemia. Peptide&#8208;based PCSK9 inhibitors have attracted pharmaceutical interest, but the effect of multivalency on bioactivity is poorly understood. Here we designed bivalent and tetravalent dendrimers, decorated with the PCSK9 inhibitory peptides Pep2&#8208;8[RRG] or P9&#8208;38, to study relationships between peptide binding affinity, peptide valency, and PCSK9 inhibition. Increased valency resulted in improved PCSK9 inhibition for both peptides, with activity improvements of up to 100&#8208;fold achieved for the P9&#8208;38&#8208;decorated dendrimers compared to monomeric P9&#8208;38 in  in vitro  competition binding assays. Furthermore, the P9&#8208;38&#8208;decorated dendrimers showed improved potency at restoring functional low&#8208;density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor levels and internalizing LDL in the presence of PCSK9, demonstrating significant cell&#8208;based activity at picomolar concentrations. This study demonstrates the potential of increasing valency as a strategy for increasing the efficacy of peptide&#8208;based PCSK9 therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Antibacterial and Anti&#8208;biofilm Activity of the Human Breast Milk Glycoprotein Lactoferrin against Group B Streptococcus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Maternal antimicrobial: Lactoferrin is an antimicrobial glycoprotein that is abundant in human breast milk. Lactoferrin has potent antimicrobial and anti&#8208;biofilm activity against Group B Streptococcus, a bacterial pathogen that causes severe perinatal infections. Additionally, lactoferrin can inhibit streptococcal adherence to human gestational tissues, underscoring its potential utility as an antimicrobial intervention during pregnancy.







Abstract
Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is an encapsulated Gram&#8208;positive human pathogen that causes invasive infections in pregnant hosts and neonates, as well as immunocompromised individuals. Colonization of the human host requires the ability to adhere to mucosal surfaces and circumnavigate the nutritional challenges and antimicrobial defenses associated with the innate immune response. Biofilm formation is a critical process to facilitate GBS survival and establishment of a replicative niche in the vertebrate host. Previous work has shown that the host responds to GBS infection by producing the innate antimicrobial glycoprotein lactoferrin, which has been implicated in repressing bacterial growth and biofilm formation. Additionally, lactoferrin is highly abundant in human breast milk and could serve a protective role against invasive microbial pathogens. This study demonstrates that human breast milk lactoferrin has antimicrobial and anti&#8208;biofilm activity against GBS and inhibits its adherence to human gestational membranes. Together, these results indicate that human milk lactoferrin could be used as a prebiotic chemotherapeutic strategy to limit the impact of bacterial adherence and biofilm formation on GBS&#8208;associated disease outcomes.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Life and death cycle of plastics: In this review, the strategies adopted by different research groups in order to enhance the stability and catalytic activity of the PETase&#8208;MHETase system for PET depolymerization to make it more suitable for industrial applications are described emphasizing the advantages provided by the use of computational methods to complement and drive experiments.







Abstract
The bacterium strain Ideonella sakaiensis 201&#8208;F6 is able to hydrolyze low&#8208;crystallinity PET films at 30&#8201;&#176;C due to two enzymes named PETase and MHETase. Since its discovery, many efforts have been dedicated to elucidating the structure and features of those two enzymes, and various authors have highlighted the necessity to optimize both the substrate binding site and the global structure in order to enhance the stability and catalytic activity of these PET biocatalysts so as to make them more suitable for industrial applications. In this review, the strategies adopted by different research groups to investigate the structure and functionality of both PETase and MHETase in depth are described, emphasizing the advantages provided by the use of computational methods to complement and drive experiments. Subsequently, the modifications implemented with protein engineering are discussed. The versatility of the enzymes secreted by I. sakaiensis enables the prediction that they will find several applications in the disposal of PET debris, encouraging a prioritization of efforts in this prolific research field.

         <title>Genomic and Targeted Approaches Unveil the Cell Membrane as a Major Target of the Antifungal Cytotoxin Amantelide A</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on chemogenomic profiling coupled with phenotypic responses, we propose the cell membrane and integrated sterols as major targets of amantelide A and hypothesize a putative role of actin in the mechanism of action. Targeted approaches including biophysical measurement of membrane binding activities in the presence and absence of sterols and actin polymerization assays established the mechanism of action.







Abstract
Amantelide A, a polyhydroxylated macrolide isolated from a marine cyanobacterium, displays broad&#8208;spectrum activity against mammalian cells, bacterial pathogens, and marine fungi. We conducted comprehensive mechanistic studies to identify the molecular targets and pathways affected by amantelide A. Our investigations relied on chemical structure similarities with compounds of known mechanisms, yeast knockout mutants, yeast chemogenomic profiling, and direct biochemical and biophysical methods. We established that amantelide A exerts its antifungal action by binding to ergosterol&#8208;containing membranes followed by pore formation and cell death, a mechanism partially shared with polyene antifungals. Binding assays demonstrated that amantelide A also binds to membranes containing epicholesterol or mammalian cholesterol, thus suggesting that the cytotoxicity to mammalian cells might be due to its affinity to cholesterol&#8208;containing membranes. However, membrane interactions were not completely dependent on sterols. Yeast chemogenomic profiling suggested additional direct or indirect effects on actin. Accordingly, we performed actin polymerization assays, which suggested that amantelide A also promotes actin polymerization in cell&#8208;free systems. However, the C&#8208;33 acetoxy derivative amantelide B showed a similar effect on actin dynamics in vitro but no significant activity against yeast. Overall, these studies suggest that the membrane effects are the most functionally relevant for amantelide A mechanism of action.

However, the C&#8208;33 acetoxy derivative amantelide B showed a similar effect on actin dynamics in vitro but no significant activity against yeast. Overall, these studies suggest that the membrane effects are the most functionally relevant for amantelide A mechanism of action.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Biosynthesis of Sinapigladioside, an Antifungal Isothiocyanate from Burkholderia Symbionts</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sinapigladioside is a rare isothiocyanate&#8208;bearing natural product from beetle&#8208;associated bacteria (  Burkholderia gladioli  ) that may protect the beetle offspring against entomopathogenic fungi. The biosynthetic origin of sinapigladioside has been elusive, and little is known about bacterial isothiocyanate biosynthesis in general. On the basis of stable&#8208;isotope labeling, bioinformatics, and mutagenesis we identified the sinapigladioside biosynthesis gene cluster in the symbiont and found that an isonitrile synthase plays a key role in the biosynthetic pathway. Genome mining and network analyses indicate that related gene clusters are distributed across various bacterial phyla including producers of both nitriles and isothiocyanates. Our findings support a model for bacterial isothiocyanate biosynthesis by sulfur transfer onto isonitrile precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeting TRIM Proteins: A Quest towards Drugging an Emerging Protein Class</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It can be hard to get TRIM: TRIM proteins, the largest subfamily of single polypeptide RING E3 ligases, are currently gaining attention as targets for drug development. However, developing effective targeting options for TRIMs is challenged by their multidomain scaffolding nature correlating with multifunctional biological roles. Herein, we highlight our current understanding of TRIMs and discuss potential targeting options.







Abstract
The ubiquitylation machinery regulates several fundamental biological processes from protein homeostasis to a wide variety of cellular signaling pathways. As a consequence, its dysregulation is linked to diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration, and autoimmunity. With this review, we aim to highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting E3 ligases, with a special focus on an emerging class of RING ligases, named tri&#8208;partite motif (TRIM) proteins, whose role as targets for drug development is currently gaining pharmaceutical attention. TRIM proteins exert their catalytic activity as scaffolds involved in many protein&#8211;protein interactions, whose multidomains and adapter&#8208;like nature make their druggability very challenging. Herein, we give an overview of the current understanding of this class of single polypeptide RING E3 ligases and discuss potential targeting options.

         <title>Arylphosphonate&#8208;Tethered Porphyrins: Fluorescence Silencing Speaks a Metal Language in Living Enterocytes**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pinpointing metals: Arylphosphonic acid fluorophores with a porphyrin core produced unique fluorescent behavior in response to each of the biologically significant metal ions studied. Thus they provide an expandable and engineerable platform for the development of improved, targeted fluorescence sensors suitable for in&#8197;vivo applications to determine and visualize metals in tissues during disease progression.







Abstract
We report the application of a highly versatile and engineerable novel sensor platform to monitor biologically significant and toxic metal ions in live human Caco&#8208;2 enterocytes. The extended conjugation between the fluorescent porphyrin core and metal ions through aromatic phenylphosphonic acid tethers generates a unique turn off and turn on fluorescence and, in addition, shifts in absorption and emission spectra for zinc, cobalt, cadmium and mercury. The reported fluorescent probes p&#8208;H8TPPA and m&#8208;H8TPPA can monitor a wide range of metal ion concentrations via fluorescence titration and also via fluorescence decay curves. Cu&#8208; and Zn&#8208;induced turn off fluorescence can be differentially reversed by the addition of common chelators. Both p&#8208;H8TPPA and m&#8208;H8TPPA readily pass the mammalian cellular membrane due to their amphipathic character as confirmed by confocal microscopic imaging of living enterocytes.

         <title>Structural Insights into Malic Enzyme Variants Favoring an Unnatural Redox Cofactor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From A to C: Structural rules for engineering NAD&#8208;dependent malic enzymes to favor the unnatural redox cofactor NCD are revealed. The residues at positions 346 and 401 act as &#8220;gatekeepers&#8221;, determining the volume of the adenine moiety binding cavity and playing an important role in cofactor recognition. These rules could help to engineer a variety of NCD&#8208;favoring enzymes.







Abstract
The use of nicotinamide cytosine dinucleotide (NCD), a biocompatible nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD) analogue, is of great scientific and biotechnological interest. Several redox enzymes have been devised to favor NCD, and have been successfully applied in creating NCD&#8208;dependent redox systems. However, molecular interactions between cofactor and protein have still to be disclosed in order to guide further engineering efforts. Here we report the structural analysis of an NCD&#8208;favoring malic enzyme (ME) variant derived from Escherichia coli. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure data revealed that the residues located at position 346 and 401 in ME acted as the &#8220;gatekeepers&#8221; of the adenine moiety binding cavity. When Arg346 was substituted with either acidic or aromatic residues, the corresponding mutants showed substantially reduced NCD preference. Inspired by these observations, we generated Lactobacillus helveticus derived d&#8208;lactate dehydrogenase variants at Ile177, the counterpart to Arg346 in ME, and found a similar trend in terms of cofactor preference changes. As many NAD&#8208;dependent oxidoreductases share key structural features, our results provide guidance for protein engineering to obtain more NCD&#8208;favoring variants.

         <title>Microenvironment&#8208;Sensitive Fluorescent Ligand Binds Ascaris Telomere Antiparallel G&#8208;Quadruplex DNA with Blue&#8208;Shift and Enhanced Emission</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 6, Page 1042-1048, March 16, 2021. </description>

Selective G4 DNA ligands: We report a novel microenvironment&#8208;sensitive fluorescent ligand (Q1) that shows selectivity to ascaris telomere antiparallel G4 DNA ASC20 through enhanced fluorescence intensity along with about 18&#8197;nm blue&#8208;shifted properties. The detailed interactions of Q1 with ASC20 G4 DNA are illustrated, and the results demonstrate that Q1 mainly binds at the terminals of ASC20 through an end&#8208;stacking mode.







Abstract
The development of small molecules that can selectively target G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNAs has drawn considerable attention due to their unique physiological and pathological functions. However, only a few molecules have been found to selectively bind a particular G4 DNA structure. We have developed a fluorescence ligand Q1, a molecular scaffold with a carbazole&#8211;pyridine core bridged by a phenylboronic acid side chain, that acts as a selective ascaris telomere antiparallel G4 DNA ASC20 ligand with about 18&#8197;nm blue&#8208;shifted and enhanced fluorescence intensity. Photophysical properties revealed that Q1 was sensitive to the microenvironment and gave the best selectivity to ASC20 with an equilibrium binding constant Ka=6.04&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence studies also demonstrated that Q1 showed a longer fluorescence lifetime in the presence of ASC20. The binding characteristics of Q1 with ASC20 were shown in detail in a fluorescent intercalator displacement (FID) assay, a 2&#8208;Ap titration experiment and by molecular docking. Ligand Q1 could adopt an appropriate pose at terminal G&#8208;quartets of ASC20 through multiple interactions including &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking between aromatic rings; this led to strong fluorescence enhancement. In addition, a co&#8208;staining image showed that Q1 is mainly distributed in the cytoplasm. Accordingly, this work provides insights for the development of ligands that selectively targeting a specific G4 DNA structure.

         <title>Novel Dioxane and Morpholino Nucleotide Analogues: Syntheses and RNA&#8208;Hybridization Properties</title>

Towards synthetic oligonucleotides: Starting from the 4&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;modified ribose derivative (1), synthetic routes to two novel nucleoside analogues with dioxane and morpholine central scaffolds were developed and realized in two diastereomeric series. The final phosphoramidites were incorporated into an artificial RNA double strand, and the thermal stabilities were determined by melting temperature analysis.







Abstract
A novel class of nucleotide analogues with a dioxane ring as central scaffold has been developed. Synthetic routes in two diastereomeric series were realized, and the final thymidine analogues were synthesized with common functionalities for the automated oligonucleotide synthesis. The chemical space of the initially derived nucleotides was expanded by changing the central dioxane to analogous morpholine derivatives. This opens up the possibility for further derivatization by attaching different substituents at the morpholine nitrogen. The novel nucleotide building blocks were incorporated into double&#8208;stranded RNA sequences, and their hybridization properties investigated by melting&#8208;temperature analysis. Both scaffolds, dioxanes and morpholines, had an equal impact on double&#8208;strand stability, but Tm values differed depending on the chirality in the six&#8208;membered ring.

         <title>A MIF&#8208;Derived Cyclopeptide that Inhibits MIF Binding and Atherogenic Signaling via the Chemokine Receptor CXCR2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 6, Page 1012-1019, March 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The specific targeting of the interaction between the atypical chemokine MIF and its receptor CXCR2, and its atherosclerosis&#8208;promoting activity in a tailored peptide&#8208;based approach is illustrated. Based on a structure&#8211;activity analysis of short N&#8208;like loop&#8208;derived MIF peptides, the cyclic MIF peptide analogue MIF(cyclo10) was identified as a promising candidate that blocks MIF/CXCR2 and counteracts MIF's inflammatory and pro&#8208;atherogenic activity.







Abstract
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an inflammatory cytokine and atypical chemokine with a key role in inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis. Key atherogenic functions of MIF are mediated by noncognate interaction with the chemokine receptor CXCR2. The MIF N&#8208;like loop comprising the sequence 47&#8211;56 is an important structural determinant of the MIF/CXCR2 interface and MIF(47&#8211;56) blocks atherogenic MIF activities. However, the mechanism and critical structure&#8211;activity information within this sequence have remained elusive. Here, we show that MIF(47&#8211;56) directly binds to CXCR2 to compete with MIF receptor activation. By using alanine scanning, essential and dispensable residues were identified. Moreover, MIF(cyclo10), a designed cyclized variant of MIF(47&#8211;56), inhibited key inflammatory and atherogenic MIF activities in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo/ex vivo, and exhibited strongly improved resistance to proteolytic degradation in human plasma in&#8197;vitro, thus suggesting that it could serve as a promising basis for MIF&#8208;derived anti&#8208;atherosclerotic peptides.

         <title>On the Use of Side&#8208;Chain NMR Relaxation Data to Derive Structural and Dynamical Information on Proteins: A Case Study Using Hen Lysozyme</title>

Different techniques, same answer: The application of S2 order&#8208;parameter restraining molecular dynamics simulations to the protein HEWL shows that this technique is able to produce a conformational ensemble compatible with experimentally derived side&#8208;chain order parameters and demonstrate that side chains on the protein surface are highly dynamic.







Abstract
Values of 
 and 
 order parameters derived from NMR relaxation measurements on proteins cannot be used straightforwardly to determine protein structure because they cannot be related to a single protein structure, but are defined in terms of an average over a conformational ensemble. Molecular dynamics simulation can generate a conformational ensemble and thus can be used to restrain 
 and 
 order parameters towards experimentally derived target values 
(exp) and 
(exp). Application of 
 and 
 order&#8208;parameter restraining MD simulation to bond vectors in 63 side chains of the protein hen egg white lysozyme using 51 
(exp) target values and 28 
(exp) target values shows that a conformational ensemble compatible with the experimentally derived data can be obtained by using this technique. It is observed that 
 order&#8208;parameter restraining of C&#8722;H bonds in methyl groups is less reliable than 
 order&#8208;parameter restraining because of the possibly less valid assumptions and approximations used to derive experimental 
(exp) values from NMR relaxation measurements and the necessity to adopt the assumption of uniform rotational motion of methyl C&#8722;H bonds around their symmetry axis and of the independence of these motions from each other. The restrained simulations demonstrate that side chains on the protein surface are highly dynamic. Any hydrogen bonds they form and that appear in any of four different crystal structures, are fluctuating with short lifetimes in solution.

Slowly does it: The correlated internal motions of GTP&#947;S&#8208;bound Ras have been quantified using relaxation dispersion NMR spectroscopy with site&#8208;specific details, demonstrating its accurate preservation of the physiological dynamics network critical for the binding of allosteric ligands.







Abstract
The millisecond timescale dynamics of activated Ras transiently sample a low&#8208;populated conformational state that has distinct surface property from the major state and represents a promising target for binding of small&#8208;molecule compounds. To avoid the complications of hydrolysis, dynamics and other properties of active Ras have so far been routinely investigated by using non&#8208;hydrolyzable GTP analogues, which, however, were previously reported to alter both the kinetics and distribution of the conformational exchange. In this study, we quantitatively measured and validated the internal dynamics of Ras complexed with a slowly hydrolyzable GTP analogue, GTP&#947;S, which increases the lifetime of active Ras by 23 times relative to that of native GTP. It was found that GTP&#947;S, in addition to its better mimicking of the exchange kinetics than the commonly used non&#8208;hydrolyzable analogues GppNHp and GppCH2p, can rigorously reproduce the natural dynamics network in active Ras, thus indicating its fitness for use in the development of allosteric inhibitors.

         <title>The Charged Linker Modulates the Conformations and Molecular Interactions of Hsp90</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 6, Page 1084-1092, March 16, 2021. </description>

Open wide: The charged linker connecting the N&#8208;terminal and middle domains of Hsp90 contains two segments with transient secondary structure that interact dynamically with strand &#946;8 of the NTD. As a consequence, this element partially detaches and exposes a hydrophobic site that mediates binding to the p53 client. Our results disclose additional roles of the NTD&#8722;MD linker.







Abstract
The molecular chaperone Hsp90 supports the functional activity of specific substrate proteins (clients). For client processing, the Hsp90 dimer undergoes a series of ATP&#8208;driven conformational rearrangements. Flexible linkers connecting the three domains of Hsp90 are crucial to enable dynamic arrangements. The long charged linker connecting the N&#8208;terminal (NTD) and middle (MD) domains exhibits additional functions in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. The structural basis for these functions remains unclear. Here, we characterize the conformation and dynamics of the linker and NTD&#8722;MD domain interactions by NMR spectroscopy. Our results reveal two regions in the linker that are dynamic and exhibit secondary structure conformation. We show that these regions mediate transient interactions with strand &#946;8 of the NTD. As a consequence, this strand detaches and exposes a hydrophobic surface patch, which enables binding to the p53 client. We propose that the charged linker plays an important regulatory role by coupling the Hsp90 NTD&#8722;MD arrangement with the accessibility of a client binding site on the NTD.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open wide&lt;/b&gt;: The charged linker connecting the N&#8208;terminal and middle domains of Hsp90 contains two segments with transient secondary structure that interact dynamically with strand &#946;8 of the NTD. As a consequence, this element partially detaches and exposes a hydrophobic site that mediates binding to the p53 client. Our results disclose additional roles of the NTD&#8722;MD linker.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The molecular chaperone Hsp90 supports the functional activity of specific substrate proteins (clients). For client processing, the Hsp90 dimer undergoes a series of ATP&#8208;driven conformational rearrangements. Flexible linkers connecting the three domains of Hsp90 are crucial to enable dynamic arrangements. The long charged linker connecting the N&#8208;terminal (NTD) and middle (MD) domains exhibits additional functions &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt;. The structural basis for these functions remains unclear. Here, we characterize the conformation and dynamics of the linker and NTD&#8722;MD domain interactions by NMR spectroscopy. Our results reveal two regions in the linker that are dynamic and exhibit secondary structure conformation. We show that these regions mediate transient interactions with strand &#946;8 of the NTD. As a consequence, this strand detaches and exposes a hydrophobic surface patch, which enables binding to the p53 client. We propose that the charged linker plays an important regulatory role by coupling the Hsp90 NTD&#8722;MD arrangement with the accessibility of a client binding site on the NTD.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Fluorescent Peptide Biosensor for Probing CDK6 Kinase Activity in Lung Cancer Cell Extracts</title>

Distinguished kinases: We describe the design, engineering and characterisation of a fluorescent peptide biosensor derived from 6&#8208;phosphofructokinase, that reports on CDK6 kinase activity in&#8197;vitro and in lung cancer cell extracts. Implementation of this biosensor in mesothelioma cell lines derived from patients highlights differences between CDK6 kinase activity and closely related CDK4 kinase activity.







Abstract
CDK6 kinase regulates cell&#8208;cycle progression in G1, together with CDK4, but has cell&#8208;, tissue&#8208; and developmentally distinct functions associated with transcription, angiogenesis and metabolism. Although CDK6 makes an attractive cancer biomarker and target, there are no means of assessing its activity in a complex environment. In this study, we describe the design, engineering and characterisation of a fluorescent peptide biosensor derived from 6&#8208;phosphofructokinase that reports on CDK6 kinase activity through sensitive changes in fluorescence intensity. This biosensor can report on CDK6 activity in a dose&#8208;dependent fashion, thereby enabling quantification of differences in kinase activity in complex and physiologically relevant environments. Further implementation of this biosensor in different lung and melanoma cell lines, as well as in mesothelioma cell lines derived from patients together with a CDK4 biosensor highlighted differences in kinase activity between CDK6 and CDK4 kinase. This work demonstrates the utility of these selective tools for monitoring two closely related kinases comparatively and simultaneously in the same samples, thereby offering attractive perspectives for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

CDA&#8208;Luc: The M. tuberculosis cyclic dinucleotide phosphodiesterase, CnpB, is leveraged to establish a coupled enzyme assay that facilitates high&#8208;throughput quantification of the bacterial signaling molecule 3&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP. This assay can be carried out in 96&#8208;well plate format and read out by a standard luminescence plate reader, thereby replacing conventional LC&#8208;MS&#8208;based quantification assays.







Abstract
Cyclic dinucleotide signaling systems, which are found ubiquitously throughout nature, allow organisms to rapidly and dynamically sense and respond to alterations in their environments. In recent years, the second messenger, cyclic di&#8208;(3&#8217;,5&#8217;)&#8208;adenosine monophosphate (c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP), has been identified as an essential signaling molecule in a diverse array of bacterial genera. We and others have shown that defects in c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP homeostasis result in severe physiological defects and virulence attenuation in many bacterial species. Despite significant advancements in the field, there is still a major gap in the understanding of the environmental and cellular factors that influence c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP dynamics due to a lack of tools to sensitively and rapidly monitor changes in c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP levels. To address this limitation, we describe here the development of a luciferase&#8208;based coupled enzyme assay that leverages the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, CnpB, for the sensitive and high&#8208;throughput quantification of 3&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP. We also demonstrate the utility of this approach for the quantification of the cyclic oligonucleotide&#8208;based anti&#8208;phage signaling system (CBASS) effector, 3&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cGAMP. These findings establish CDA&#8208;Luc as a more affordable and sensitive alternative to conventional c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP detection tools with broad utility for the study of bacterial cyclic dinucleotide physiology.

Coming through: The black lipid membrane technique was used to investigate the membrane&#8208;permeabilization abilities of a series of amphiphilic antimicrobial polymers. The most potent antibacterial polymer induces step&#8208;like current behavior typical for an ion&#8208;channel.







Abstract
Amphiphilic antimicrobial polymers display activity against the outer bacterial cell membrane, triggering various physiological effects. We investigated the regulation of ion transport across the lipid bilayer to understand differences in biological activity for a series of amphiphilic polymethyloxazoline &#8211; polyethyleneimine copolymers. The results confirmed that the tested structures were able to increase the permeability of the lipid bilayer (LB) membrane or its rupture. Black lipid membrane (BLM) experiments show that the triggered conductance profile and its character is strongly correlated with the polymer structure and zeta potential. The polymer exhibiting the highest antimicrobial activity promotes ion transport by using a unique mechanism and step&#8208;like characteristics with well&#8208;defined discreet openings and closings. The molecule was incorporated into the membrane in a reproducible way, and the observed channel&#8208;like activity could be responsible for the antibacterial activity of this molecule.

         <title>CYP154C5 Regioselectivity in Steroid Hydroxylation Explored by Substrate Modifications and Protein Engineering**

Changes in selectivity: Using substrate and protein engineering based on key residues and functional groups, the regioselectivity of the bacterial cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP154C5 in the hydroxylation of different steroids was altered. Apart from 16&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation, steroid products containing hydroxy groups in 15&#945; and 21 position were formed.







Abstract
CYP154C5 from Nocardia farcinica is a P450 monooxygenase able to hydroxylate a range of steroids with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity at the 16&#945;&#8208;position. Using protein engineering and substrate modifications based on the crystal structure of CYP154C5, an altered regioselectivity of the enzyme in steroid hydroxylation had been achieved. Thus, conversion of progesterone by mutant CYP154C5 F92A resulted in formation of the corresponding 21&#8208;hydroxylated product 11&#8208;deoxycorticosterone in addition to 16&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation. Using MD simulation, this altered regioselectivity appeared to result from an alternative binding mode of the steroid in the active site of mutant F92A. MD simulation further suggested that the entrance of water to the active site caused higher uncoupling in this mutant. Moreover, exclusive 15&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation was observed for wild&#8208;type CYP154C5 in the conversion of 5&#945;&#8208;androstan&#8208;3&#8208;one, lacking an oxy&#8208;functional group at C17. Overall, our data give valuable insight into the structure&#8211;function relationship of this cytochrome P450 monooxygenase for steroid hydroxylation.

         <title>Stepwise Strategy for One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Single&#8208;Stranded DNA Rings from Multiple Short Fragments</title>

One at a time, please: Large, circular, single&#8208;stranded DNAs (up to 452&#8208;nt sizes) have been efficiently prepared from multiple linear, single&#8208;stranded short DNA fragments by using T4 DNA ligase through sequential addition of different sets of splints in a one&#8208;pot reaction. The lengths of splints and the order of splint addition were optimized to obtain a satisfying yield of c&#8208;ssDNA products. This method is convenient and practical, and benefits the development of DNA nanotechnology and bioscience.







Abstract
Cyclic rings of single&#8208;stranded (ss) DNA have various unique properties, but wider applications have been hampered by their poor availability. This paper reports a convenient one&#8208;pot method in which these rings are efficiently synthesized by using T4 DNA ligase through convergent cyclization of easily available short DNA fragments. The key to the present method is to separate all the splint oligonucleotides into several sets, and add each set sequentially at an appropriate interval to the solutions containing all the short DNA fragments. Compared with simple one&#8208;pot strategies involving simultaneous addition of all the splints at the beginning of the reaction, both the selectivity and the yields of target ssDNA rings are greatly improved. This convergent method is especially useful for preparing large&#8208;sized rings that are otherwise hard to obtain. By starting from six short DNA fragments (71&#8211;82&#8197;nt), prepared by a DNA synthesizer, a ssDNA ring of 452&#8208;nt size was synthesized in 35&#8197;mol&#8201;% yield and in high selectivity. Satisfactorily pure DNA rings were obtainable simply by treating the crude products with exonuclease.

         <title>The Antibacterial Drug Candidate SBC3 is a Potent Inhibitor of Bacterial Thioredoxin Reductase</title>

Silver lining: Antibiotic resistance jeopardizes the effective treatment of infectious diseases and represents an increasing threat to public health. We discovered that the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene 1,3&#8208;dibenzyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;diphenylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene silver(I) acetate (SBC3) is a potent inhibitor of bacterial thioredoxin reductase that proved to be highly effective against resistant Gram&#8208;negative nosocomial isolates.







Abstract
Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem for public health and associated with increasing economic costs and mortality rates. Silver and silver&#8208;related compounds have been used for centuries due to their antimicrobial properties. In this work, we show that 1,3&#8208;dibenzyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene silver(I) acetate/NHC*&#8208;Ag&#8208;OAc (SBC3) is a reversible, high affinity inhibitor of E. coli thioredoxin reductase (TrxR; Ki=10.8&#177;1.2&#8197;nM). Minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) tests with different E. coli and P. aeruginosa strains demonstrated that SBC3 can efficiently inhibit bacterial cell growth, especially in combination with established antibiotics like gentamicin. Our results show that SBC3 is a promising antibiotic drug candidate targeting bacterial TrxR.

         <title>Biosynthetic Intermediate Probes for Visualizing and Identifying the Biosynthetic Enzymes of Plant Metabolites</title>

See what&#8216;s missing: Biosynthetic study of plant metabolites paves the way for manufacturing plant&#8208;derived drugs by synthetic biology. However, identifying any missing enzymes in a plant metabolic pathway is a formidable challenge. Biosynthetic intermediate probes make potentially useful tools to resolve the challenge by visualizing biosynthetic enzymes to facilitate transcriptome analysis or chemical proteomics approaches for identifying the biosynthetic enzymes.







Abstract
Plant metabolites play important roles in both plant physiology and drug discovery. Taking advantage of new emerging technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS), whole genome assembly, bioinformatics, omics&#8208;based strategies have been demonstrated as popular and powerful ways to elucidate complex metabolic pathways in plants. In this viewpoint, biosynthetic intermediates probes have been proposed as the potentinal tools to study the plant natural product biosynthesis via chemical proteomics appoaches or transcriptome analysis.

         <title>Chemical Translational Biology: Redefining Druggability of Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions</title>

Protein&#8208;protein interactions are challenging targets for drug discovery. The field of chemical translational biology has made advances in making these once &#8220;undruggable&#8221; targets more amenable to ligand discovery and design. The development of peptide therapeutics and the discovery of adaptive and allosteric ligands show particular promise for difficult interactions.







Abstract
Chemical biologists use chemical tools to answer biological questions. The translational application of these principles has led to an explosion in the discovery and druggability of new protein targets, including protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs). Proteins tend to interact with other macromolecules using relatively large and featureless binding surfaces, which has hampered traditional drug discovery efforts, particularly for interactions with weaker affinity. In this article, I discuss several emerging strategies for targeting PPIs, including computational and structural methods and novel screening approaches. In particular, I focus on hijacking intrinsic protein allosteric pathways for the discovery and design of small&#8208;molecule and peptide ligands.

Multicomponent products are assembled step by step: When more than three kinds of parts are used to prepare thousands of big molecules with a specific structure, the procedure has to be carefully designed. For example, when ligating ssDNA strands to a long circular ssDNA, each group should contain only two or three stands to give a high yield. This rule has to be obeyed until the final product is obtained, otherwise, the materials will be used up before it is ready. This design is suitable for preparing any other complex molecule. More information can be found in the full paper by X. G. Liang et&#8197;al.

Cysteine&#8208;rich peptides are being used as stable scaffolds to produce bioactive grafted peptides with either a single epitope (first generation), two identical epitopes (second generation), or two distinct epitopes (third generation). The spatial grid is a metaphor for the tridimensional design one needs to consider when combining a scaffold with one or more epitopes. More information can be found in the minireview by F. Plisson et&#8197;al. Picture by R. G.&#8208;C.

COVID&#8208;19 is a pandemic that requires global action. This review presents the latest status of research on the use of two drugs (favipiravir and remdesivir) in tackling COVID&#8208;19, and offers an overview of the life cycle and routes of transmission of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. It is hoped that the opportunities and challenges brought about by the use of these two drugs can be illuminated for future research.







Abstract
The human world is currently influenced largely by the outbreak of pandemic COVID&#8208;19. At this moment, most researchers focus on developing treatment strategies and measures to work against COVID&#8208;19. Treatment strategies specific for COVID&#8208;19 are lacking. This article provides an overview of the life cycle and routes of transmission of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. The therapeutic effects of two drugs [i.&#8201;e., remdesivir (RDV) and favipiravir (FPV)] which can potentially tackle COVID&#8208;19 are discussed based on current published data. This review can serve as a reference for future studies.

         <title>Hydrogen Sulfide Oxidation by Sulfide Quinone Oxidoreductase</title>

Regulating sulfide toxicity and signaling: Utilizing an active&#8208;site cysteine trisulfide, human sulfide quinone oxidoreductase detoxifies hydrogen sulfide, a respiratory poison. Herein, we detail the remarkable enzymology of sulfide quinone oxidoreductase and its potential modulation of sulfide signaling.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an environmental toxin and a heritage of ancient microbial metabolism that has stimulated new interest following its discovery as a neuromodulator. While many physiological responses have been attributed to low H2S levels, higher levels inhibit complex IV in the electron transport chain. To prevent respiratory poisoning, a dedicated set of enzymes that make up the mitochondrial sulfide oxidation pathway exists to clear H2S. The committed step in this pathway is catalyzed by sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR), which couples sulfide oxidation to coenzyme Q10 reduction in the electron transport chain. The SQOR reaction prevents H2S accumulation and generates highly reactive persulfide species as products; these can be further oxidized or can modify cysteine residues in proteins by persulfidation. Here, we review the kinetic and structural characteristics of human SQOR, and how its unconventional redox cofactor configuration and substrate promiscuity lead to sulfide clearance and potentially expand the signaling potential of H2S. This dual role of SQOR makes it a promising target for H2S&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Enzymatic Modification of Cellulose To Unlock Its Exploitation in Advanced Materials</title>

Promising new biomaterials: Cellulose, the most abundant natural polymer, is of great interest for industrial use, due to its low cost, chemical stability, mechanical properties and recyclability. The application of different enzyme&#8208;based processes to modify cellulose are reviewed here. The type of reaction, the mediators, substrates and enzymes used and the properties of cellulose derivatives are discussed in detail.







Abstract
Nowadays natural biopolymers have a wide variety of uses in various industrial applications, such as food, adhesives and composite materials. Among them, cellulose has attracted the interest of researchers due to its properties: high strength and flexibility, biocompatibility and nontoxicity. Despite that, in many cases its practical use is limited because of poor solubility and/or an unsuitable hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance. In this context, enzymatic modification appears as a powerful strategy to overcome these problems through selective, green and environmentally friendly processes. This minireview discusses the different methods developed for the enzymatic modification of cellulose, emphasizing the type of reaction, the enzymes used (laccases, esterases, lipases, hexokinases, etc.), and the properties and applications of the cellulose derivatives obtained. Considering that cellulose is the most abundant natural polymer on Earth and can be derived from residual lignocellulosic biomass, the impact of its use in bio&#8208;based process following the logic of the circular economy is relevant.

Better in the loop: Cysteine&#8208;rich peptides possess hyperstability against high temperatures, salt concentration, serum presence, and proteolytic degradation. These peptides have been successfully used as stable scaffolds for molecular grafting, a protein engineering process in which cysteine&#8208;rich structures enclave an exogenous and bioactive epitope that provides higher thermodynamic and metabolic stability to the epitope and new functionality to the scaffold.







Abstract
Cysteine&#8208;rich peptides (CRPs) are small proteins of less than 100 amino acids in length characterized by the presence of disulfide bridges and common end&#8208;to&#8208;end macrocyclization. These properties confer hyperstability against high temperatures, salt concentration, serum presence, and protease degradation to CRPs. Moreover, their intercysteine domains (loops) are susceptible to residue hypervariability. CRPs have been successfully applied as stable scaffolds for molecular grafting, a protein engineering process in which cysteine&#8208;rich structures provide higher thermodynamic and metabolic stability to an epitope and acquire new biological function(s). This review describes the successes and limitations of seven cysteine&#8208;rich scaffolds, their bioactive epitopes, and the resulting grafted peptides.

         <title>Coniferyl Alcohol Radical Detection by the Dirigent Protein AtDIR6 Monitored by EPR</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 6, Page 992-995, March 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stabilization of CA&#8226; by DIR has been observed experimentally. Using controlled photo&#8208;irradiation of coniferyl alcohol to generate a CA&#8226; and room temperature EPR and HPLC to monitor its fate, we demonstrate that the dirigent protein AtDIR6 stabilizes the formed radical prior to directing the coupling of radicals towards the formation of (&#8722;)&#8208;pinoresinol.







Abstract
Plant dirigent proteins (DIRs) control the stereoselectivity of the monolignol coniferyl alcohol radical coupling. The main mechanistic hypothesis on this chemo&#8208; and stereoselective reaction invokes a binding of coniferyl alcohol radical substrates in the dirigent protein active site so that only one enantiomeric form can be produced. We have studied the influence of the Arabidopsis thaliana AtDIR6 protein on the transient coniferyl alcohol radical by EPR. Herein, we show that AtDIR6 stabilizes coniferyl alcohol radicals prior to directing their coupling towards the formation of (&#8722;)&#8208;pinoresinol.

We have studied the influence of the &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana At&lt;/i&gt;DIR6 protein on the transient coniferyl alcohol radical by EPR. Herein, we show that &lt;i&gt;At&lt;/i&gt;DIR6 stabilizes coniferyl alcohol radicals prior to directing their coupling towards the formation of (&#8722;)&#8208;pinoresinol.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>An Animal Able To Tolerate D2O</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 6, Page 988-991, March 16, 2021. </description>

Anhydrobiosis allows two&#8208;step organismal H2O to D2O replacement in the nematode P. superbus, as well as its survival. It is thus the first animal species shown to reproduce in 99.9&#8201;% D2O. In silico structural analyses reveal that its water channel protein is an aquaglyceroporin, whose larger pore might help explain successful organismal influx of D2O.







Abstract
It is possible to gain a deeper insight into the role of water in biology by using physicochemical variant molecules, such as deuterium oxide (D2O); however, D2O is toxic to multicellular organisms in high concentrations. By using a unique desiccation&#8208;rehydration process, we demonstrate that the anhydrobiotic nematode Panagrolaimus superbus is able to tolerate and proliferate in 99&#8201;% D2O. Moreover, we analysed P. superbus&#8217; water&#8208;channel protein (aquaporin; AQP), which is associated with dehydration/rehydration, by comparing its primary structure and modelling its tertiary structure in silico. Our data evidence that P. superbus&#8217; AQP is an aquaglyceroporin, a class of water channel known to display a wider pore; this helps to explain the rapid and successful organismal influx of D2O into this species. This is the first demonstration of an animal able to withstand high D2O levels, thus paving a way for the investigation of the effects D2O on higher levels of biological organization.

         <title>A Methionine Chemical Shift Based Order Parameter Characterizing Global Protein Dynamics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 6, Page 1001-1004, March 16, 2021. </description>

Near or far: The solution 13C&#8208;NMR chemical shifts of methione methyl groups in a protein are linearly correlated with the values calculated from rigid X&#8208;ray models. The protein dependent slope provides an order parameter for the network of dynamic interactions connecting motions of distant residues.







Abstract
Coupling of side chain dynamics over long distances is an important component of allostery. Methionine side chains show the largest intrinsic flexibility among methyl&#8208;containing residues but the actual degree of conformational averaging depends on the proximity and mobility of neighboring residues. The 13C NMR chemical shifts of the methyl groups of methionine residues located at long distances in the same protein show a similar scaling with respect to the values predicted from the static X&#8208;ray structure by quantum methods. This results in a good linear correlation between calculated and observed chemical shifts. The slope is protein dependent and ranges from zero for the highly flexible calmodulin to 0.7 for the much more rigid calcineurin catalytic domain. The linear correlation is indicative of a similar level of side&#8208;chain conformational averaging over long distances, and the slope of the correlation line can be interpreted as an order parameter of the global side&#8208;chain flexibility.

         <title>A High&#8208;Throughput Screening Method for the Directed Evolution of Hydroxynitrile Lyase towards Cyanohydrin Synthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 6, Page 996-1000, March 16, 2021. </description>

Making biohydrocyanation measurable: Hydroxynitrile lyases (HNLs) catalyze the enantioselective cleavage/formation of cyanohydrins. However, current methods for determining hydrocyanation are not suitable for mass screening of mutants for protein engineering of these biocatalysts. We demonstrate herein a chromogenic high&#8208;throughput screening method for cyanohydrin synthesis that is validated by either substrate profiling or the directed evolution of HNLs.







Abstract
Chiral cyanohydrins are useful intermediates in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. In nature, hydroxynitrile lyases (HNLs) are a kind of elegant tool for enantioselective hydrocyanation of carbonyl compounds. However, currently available methods for demonstrating hydrocyanation are still stalled at precise, but low&#8208;throughput, GC or HPLC analyses. Herein, we report a chromogenic high&#8208;throughput screening (HTS) method that is feasible for the cyanohydrin synthesis reaction. This method was highly anti&#8208;interference and sensitive, and could be used to directly profile the substrate scope of HNLs either in cell&#8208;free extract or fermentation clear broth. This HTS method was also validated by generating new variants of PcHNL5 that presented higher catalytic efficiency and stronger acidic tolerance in variant libraries.

         <title>Tuning the Transglycosylation Reaction of a GH11 Xylanase by a Delicate Enhancement of its Thumb Flexibility</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shifting the balance: Glycoside hydrolases are attractive tools for the enzymatic synthesis of carbohydrates. We used the xylanase from B. circulans (BCX) to study the interplay between active&#8208;site flexibility and the transglycosylation reaction. A point mutation that enhances the flexibility and dynamics of BCX active site shifts the balance of the enzymatic reaction toward transglycosylation.







Abstract
Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) are attractive tools for multiple biotechnological applications. In conjunction with their hydrolytic function, GHs can perform transglycosylation under specific conditions. In nature, oligosaccharide synthesis is performed by glycosyltransferases (GTs); however, the industrial use of GTs is limited by their instability in solution. A key difference between GTs and GHs is the flexibility of their binding site architecture. We have used the xylanase from Bacillus circulans (BCX) to study the interplay between active&#8208;site flexibility and transglycosylation. Residues of the BCX &#8220;thumb&#8221; were substituted to increase the flexibility of the enzyme binding site. Replacement of the highly conserved residue P116 with glycine shifted the balance of the BCX enzymatic reaction toward transglycosylation. The effects of this point mutation on the structure and dynamics of BCX were investigated by NMR spectroscopy. The P116G mutation induces subtle changes in the configuration of the thumb and enhances the millisecond dynamics of the active site. Based on our findings, we propose the remodelling of the GH enzymes glycon site flexibility as a strategy to improve the transglycosylation efficiency of these biotechnologically important catalysts.

         <title>Production of the Carboxylate Reductase from Nocardia otitidiscaviarum in a Soluble, Active Form for in&#8197;vitro Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalytic reduction of carboxylates: Optimization of cultivation parameters and host strain selection were fundamental to decreasing the formation of inclusion bodies and enhancing the production of NoCAR, which was able to reduce up to 65&#8197;mM sodium benzoate to benzaldehyde in 24&#8197;h with integrated in&#8197;vitro recycling of NADPH and ATP.







Abstract
Accessing aldehydes from carboxylate moieties is often a challenging task. In this regard, carboxylate reductases (CARs) are promising catalysts provided by nature that are able to accomplish this task in just one step, avoiding over&#8208;reduction to the alcohol product. However, the heterologous expression of CARs can be quite difficult due to the excessive formation of insoluble protein, thus hindering further characterization and application of the enzyme. Here, the heterologous production of the carboxylate reductase from Nocardia otitidiscaviarum (NoCAR) was optimized by a combination of i) optimized cultivation conditions, ii) post&#8208;translational modification with a phosphopantetheinyl transferase and iii) selection of an appropriate expression strain. Especially, the selection of Escherichia coli tuner cells as host had a strong effect on the final 110&#8208;fold increase in the specific activity of NoCAR. This highly active NoCAR was used to reduce sodium benzoate to benzaldehyde, and it was successfully assembled with an in&#8197;vitro regeneration of ATP and NADPH, being capable of reducing about 30&#8197;mM sodium benzoate with high selectivity in only 2&#8197;h of reaction.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Biocatalytic reduction of carboxylates&lt;/b&gt;: Optimization of cultivation parameters and host strain selection were fundamental to decreasing the formation of inclusion bodies and enhancing the production of &lt;i&gt;No&lt;/i&gt;CAR, which was able to reduce up to 65&#8197;mM sodium benzoate to benzaldehyde in 24&#8197;h with integrated &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; recycling of NADPH and ATP.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessing aldehydes from carboxylate moieties is often a challenging task. In this regard, carboxylate reductases (CARs) are promising catalysts provided by nature that are able to accomplish this task in just one step, avoiding over&#8208;reduction to the alcohol product. However, the heterologous expression of CARs can be quite difficult due to the excessive formation of insoluble protein, thus hindering further characterization and application of the enzyme. Here, the heterologous production of the carboxylate reductase from &lt;i&gt;Nocardia otitidiscaviarum&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;No&lt;/i&gt;CAR) was optimized by a combination of i) optimized cultivation conditions, ii) post&#8208;translational modification with a phosphopantetheinyl transferase and iii) selection of an appropriate expression strain. Especially, the selection of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; tuner cells as host had a strong effect on the final 110&#8208;fold increase in the specific activity of &lt;i&gt;No&lt;/i&gt;CAR. This highly active &lt;i&gt;No&lt;/i&gt;CAR was used to reduce sodium benzoate to benzaldehyde, and it was successfully assembled with an &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; regeneration of ATP and NADPH, being capable of reducing about 30&#8197;mM sodium benzoate with high selectivity in only 2&#8197;h of reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Sirtuin 2 Regulates Protein LactoylLys Modifications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) play roles in both physiological and pathophysiological processes through the regulation of enzyme structure and function. We recently identified a novel PTM, lactoylLys, derived through a non&#8208;enzymatic mechanism from the glycolytic by&#8208;product, lactoylglutathione. Under physiologic scenarios, glyoxalase 2 prevents the accumulation of lactoylglutathione and thus lactoylLys modifications. What dictates the site&#8208;specificity and abundance of lactoylLys PTMs, however, remains unknown. Here, we report sirtuin 2 as a lactoylLys eraser. Using chemical biology and CRISPR&#8208;Cas9, we show that SIRT2 controls the abundance of this PTM both globally and on chromatin. These results address a major gap in our understanding of how non&#8208;enzymatic PTMs are regulated and controlled.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Hydrocarbon Conjugation and Cyclisation in Synthetic Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strength in weakness: Selective and high&#8208;yielding late&#8208;stage modifications to unprotected synthetic peptides and proteins are enabled by S&#8208;alkylation of cysteine by using weakly electrophilic alkyl halides and zinc complexes. Under neutral conditions, iodoalkanes do not compromise selectivity for cysteine: Zn2+ can bind other amino acids but only Cys is alkylated.







Abstract
The conventional S&#8208;alkylation of cysteine relies upon using activated electrophiles. Here we demonstrate high&#8208;yielding and selective S&#8208;alkylation and S&#8208;lipidation of cysteines in unprotected synthetic peptides and proteins by using weak electrophiles and a Zn2+ promoter. Linear or branched iodoalkanes can S&#8208;alkylate cysteine in an unprotected 38&#8208;residue Myc peptide fragment and in a 91&#8208;residue miniprotein Omomyc, thus highlighting selective late&#8208;stage synthetic modifications. Metal&#8208;assisted cysteine alkylation is also effective for incorporating dehydroalanine into unprotected peptides and for peptide cyclisation via aliphatic thioether crosslinks, including customising macrocycles to stabilise helical peptides for enhanced uptake and delivery to proteins inside cells. Chemoselective and efficient late&#8208;stage Zn2+&#8208;promoted cysteine alkylation in unprotected peptides and proteins promises many useful applications.

         <title>Recent Advances of DNA Tetrahedra for Therapeutic Delivery and Biosensing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional nanodevices: DNA tetrahedra represent a versatile construct that can be functionalized for numerous purposes including the delivery of small molecules and oligonucleotide therapeutics to the cell as well as a range of applications for biosensing. In this minireview, a number of exciting recent advances in functional nanodevices based on this intriguing structure are highlighted.







Abstract
The chemical and self&#8208;assembly properties of nucleic acids make them ideal for the construction of discrete structures and stimuli&#8208;responsive devices for a diverse array of applications. Amongst the various three&#8208;dimensional assemblies, DNA tetrahedra are of particular interest, as these structures have been shown to be readily taken up by the cell, by the process of caveolin&#8208;mediated endocytosis, without the need for transfection agents. Moreover, these structures can be readily modified with a diverse range of pendant groups to confer greater functionality. This minireview highlights recent advances related to applications of this interesting DNA structure including the delivery of therapeutic agents ranging from small molecules to oligonucleotides in addition to its use for sensing and imaging various species within the cell.

         <title>Fluorophosphonates on&#8208;Demand: A General and Simplified Approach toward Fluorophosphonate Synthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not too demanding: A robust and purification&#8208;free, one&#8208;step synthesis has been developed to enable the on&#8208;demand preparation of structurally diverse fluorophosphonates from a stable, and storable &#8220;toolbox&#8221; of readily accessible p&#8208;nitrophenylphosphonates. Additionally, a reaction&#8208;to&#8208;assay protocol is highlighted that further facilitates the rapid screening of these valuable activity&#8208;based probes.







Abstract
Herein, we report a general and simplified synthesis of fluorophosphonates directly from p&#8208;nitrophenylphosphonates. This FP on&#8208;demand reaction is mediated by a commercially available polymer&#8208;supported fluoride reagent that produces a variety (25 examples) of fluorophosphonates in high yields while only requiring reagent filtration for pure fluorophosphonate isolation. This reaction protocol facilitates the rapid profiling of serine hydrolases with diverse and novel sets of activated phosphonates with differential proteome reactivity. Moreover, slight modification of the procedure into a reaction&#8208;to&#8208;assay format has enabled additional screening efficiency.

         <title>G&#8208;Quadruplex Formation in a Putative Coding Region of White Spot Syndrome Virus: Structural and Thermodynamic Aspects</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>White spot disease (WSD) is one of the most devastating viral infections of crustaceans caused by the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). A conserved sequence WSSV131 in the DNA genome of WSSV was found to fold into a polymorphic G&#8208;quadruplex structure. Supported by two mutant sequences with single G&#8594;T substitutions in the third G4&#8208;tract of WSSV131, circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopic analyses demonstrate folding of the wild&#8208;type sequence into a three&#8208;tetrad parallel topology comprising three propeller loops with a major 1:3:1 and a minor 1:2:2 loop length arrangement. A thermodynamic analysis of quadruplex formation by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicates a thermodynamically more stable 1:3:1 loop isomer. DSC also revealed the formation of additional highly stable multimeric species with populations depending on potassium ion concentration.</dc:description>

         <title>Co&#8208;occurring Congeners Reveal the Position of Enantiomeric Amino Acids in Nonribosomal Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The position of enantiomeric amino acid residues in some nonribosomal peptides can be revealed by Marfey's analysis of co&#8208;occurring minor congeners. This concept does not rely on genome sequencing and is an alternative to laborious approaches based on partial peptide hydrolysis or the synthesis of diastereomers.







Abstract
The absolute configuration of the constituent amino acids in microbial nonribosomal peptides is typically determined by Marfey's method after total hydrolysis of the peptide. A challenge to structure elucidation arises when both d and l enantiomeric configurations of an amino acid are present. Determining the actual position of each amino acid enantiomer within the peptide sequence typically requires laborious approaches based on peptide partial hydrolysis or even total synthesis of the possible diastereomers. Herein, an alternative solution is discussed based on the homogeneous backbone chirality that governs all peptides biosynthesized by a common nonribosomal peptide synthetase. The information on configuration provided by Marfey's analysis of co&#8208;occurring minor congeners can reveal unequivocally the stereochemical sequence of the whole peptide family.

         <title>Electron Microscopy Imaging Applications of Room Temperature Ionic Liquids in the Biological Field &#8211; A Review</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For biological imaging using electron microscopy (EM), the use of room&#8208;temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) has been proposed as an alternative to traditional lengthy preparation methods. With their low vapour pressures and conductivity, RTILs can be applied onto hard&#8208;to&#8208;image soft and/or wet samples without dehydration &#8211; allowing for a more representative, hydrated state of material and opening the possibility for visualization of  in situ  physiological processes using conventional EM systems. However, RTILs have yet to be utilized to their full potential by microscopists and microbiologists alike. To this end, this review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of biological applications of RTILs for EM to bridge the RTIL,  in situ  microscopy, and biological communities. We outline future research avenues for the use of RTILs for the EM observation of biological samples, notably i) RTIL selection and optimization, ii) applications for live cell processes and iii) electron beam and ionic liquid interaction studies.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Reversed&#8208;Phase Flash Chromatography Purification of Peptides and Chemically Modified Insulins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Purification of peptides made easy: Automated flash chromatography using reversed&#8208;phase high&#8208;performance columns and low&#8208;to&#8208;medium pressure is an alternative to HPLC. It enables the purification of peptides that are poorly soluble or very hydrophobic.







Abstract
Preparative reversed&#8208;phase HPLC is the established method for the purification of peptides, but has significant limitations. We systematically investigated the use of high&#8208;performance reversed&#8208;phase flash chromatography (HPFC) to rapidly purify laboratory&#8208;scale quantities of crude, synthetic peptides and chemically modified insulins. We demonstrated these methods for a diverse set of peptides, including short, medium, and long peptides. Depending on the purity profile of the peptide, HPFC can be used either as the sole purification method, or as a pre&#8208;purification method prior to final HPLC purification. Furthermore, HPFC is suitable for the purification of peptides that are not fully in solution. We provide guidelines for the HPFC of synthetic peptides and small proteins, including the choice of columns, eluents, and gradients. We believe that HPFC is a valuable alternative to HPLC purification of peptides and small proteins.

         <dc:description>Enzyme&#8208;catalysed site&#8208;specific protein modifications enable the precision manufacture of conjugates for the study of protein function and/or for therapeutic or diagnostic applications. Asparaginyl ligases are a class of highly efficient transpeptidases with the capacity to modify proteins bearing only a tripeptide recognition motif. Here we review the types of protein modifications that are accessible using these enzymes, including N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal protein labelling, head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclisation, and protein&#8208;protein conjugation. We describe the progress that has been made to engineer highly efficient ligases as well as efforts to chemically manipulate the enzyme reaction to favour product formation. These enzymes are powerful additions to the protein engineer&#8217;s toolbox.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of CRISPR&#8208;BLI platform for real&#8208;time, sensitive, and&#160;specific DNA detection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology has been widely applied for nucleic acid detection because of its high specificity. By using the highly specific and irreversible bond between HaloTag and its alkane chlorine ligand, we modified dCas9 (deactivated CRISPR/Cas 9) with biotin as a biosensor to detect nucleic acids. The CRISPR biosensor was facilely prepared to adequately maintain its DNA&#8208;recognition capability. Furthermore, by coupling biolayer interferometry (BLI) with the CRISPR biosensor, a real&#8208;time, sensitive, and rapid digital system called CRISPR&#8211;BLI was established for the detection of double&#8208;stranded DNA. The CRISPR biosensor immobilised on the biolayer could recruit the target DNA onto the biosensor surface and change its optical thickness, resulting in a shift in the interference pattern and responding signal of the BLI. The CRISPR&#8211;BLI system was further applied to detect the ALP &#160;gene of Escherichia coil DH5&#945; combined with polymerase chain reaction, which demonstrated a linear range from 20 to 20,000 pg and a low detection limit (1.34 pg). The CRISPR&#8211;BLI system is a promising approach for rapid and sensitive detection of target DNA analytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Methionine Sulfoxide on the Synthesis and Purification of Aggregation&#8208;Prone Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ox and red: A synthesis and purification method for methionine&#8208;containing hydrophobic and aggregation&#8208;prone peptides that exploits the reversibility of methionine oxidation is reported. Incorporating methionine sulfoxide rather than methionine reduces aggregation during peptide synthesis and significantly facilitates peptide purification due to the increased peptide polarity. Final reduction to methionine proceeds smoothly and quantitatively.







Abstract
A two&#8208;step synthesis for methionine&#8208;containing hydrophobic and/or aggregation&#8208;prone peptides is presented that takes advantage of the reversibility of methionine oxidation. The use of polar methionine sulfoxide as a building block in solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis improves the synthesis quality and yields the crude peptide, with significantly improved solubility compared to the reduced species. This facilitates the otherwise often laborious peptide purification by high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography. The subsequent reduction proceeds quantitatively. This approach has been optimised with the methionine&#8208;rich Tar&#8208;DNA&#8208;binding protein 43 (307&#8211;347), but is also more generally applicable, as demonstrated by the syntheses of human calcitonin and two aggregation&#8208;prone peptides from the human prion protein.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ox and red&lt;/b&gt;: A synthesis and purification method for methionine&#8208;containing hydrophobic and aggregation&#8208;prone peptides that exploits the reversibility of methionine oxidation is reported. Incorporating methionine sulfoxide rather than methionine reduces aggregation during peptide synthesis and significantly facilitates peptide purification due to the increased peptide polarity. Final reduction to methionine proceeds smoothly and quantitatively.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A two&#8208;step synthesis for methionine&#8208;containing hydrophobic and/or aggregation&#8208;prone peptides is presented that takes advantage of the reversibility of methionine oxidation. The use of polar methionine sulfoxide as a building block in solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis improves the synthesis quality and yields the crude peptide, with significantly improved solubility compared to the reduced species. This facilitates the otherwise often laborious peptide purification by high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography. The subsequent reduction proceeds quantitatively. This approach has been optimised with the methionine&#8208;rich Tar&#8208;DNA&#8208;binding protein 43 (307&#8211;347), but is also more generally applicable, as demonstrated by the syntheses of human calcitonin and two aggregation&#8208;prone peptides from the human prion protein.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Artificial Organelles: Towards Adding or Restoring Intracellular Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoreactors meet living systems. Artificial organelles, synthetic analogues of natural organelles, are gaining interest for the correction of dysfunctional intracellular processes and the addition of novel functionalities to living systems. This review outlines the different strategies via which these mostly nanosized catalytic compartments are produced and integrated with living cells.







Abstract
Compartmentalization is one of the main characteristics that define living systems. Creating a physically separated microenvironment allows nature a better control over biological processes, as is clearly specified by the role of organelles in living cells. Inspired by this phenomenon, researchers have developed a range of different approaches to create artificial organelles: compartments with catalytic activity that add new function to living cells. In this review we will discuss three complementary lines of investigation. First, orthogonal chemistry approaches are discussed, which are based on the incorporation of catalytically active transition metal&#8208;containing nanoparticles in living cells. The second approach involves the use of premade hybrid nanoreactors, which show transient function when taken up by living cells. The third approach utilizes mostly genetic engineering methods to create bio&#8208;based structures that can be ultimately integrated with the cell's genome to make them constitutively active. The current state of the art and the scope and limitations of the field will be highlighted with selected examples from the three approaches.

         <title>Ligand Binding to Dynamically Populated G&#8208;Quadruplex DNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Returning to the fold: We reveal the molecular mechanisms of binding of a small&#8208;molecule ligand to dynamically populated G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4). Upon ligand binding, a large G4 conformational redistribution occurs. This is driven by a combination of two distinct phenomena: ligand&#8208;induced G4 folding and ligand&#8208;induced trapping of folded G4 conformations.







Abstract
Several small&#8208;molecule ligands specifically bind and stabilize G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) nucleic acid structures, which are considered to be promising therapeutic targets. G4s are polymorphic structures of varying stability, and their formation is dynamic. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of ligand binding to dynamically populated human telomere G4 DNA by using the bisquinolinium based ligand Phen&#8208;DC3 and a combination of single&#8208;molecule FRET microscopy, ensemble FRET and CD spectroscopies. Different cations are used to tune G4 polymorphism and folding dynamics. We find that ligand binding occurs to pre&#8208;folded G4 structures and that Phen&#8208;DC3 also induces G4 formation in unfolded single strands. Following ligand binding to dynamically populated G4s, the DNA undergoes pronounced conformational redistributions that do not involve direct ligand&#8208;induced G4 conformational interconversion. On the contrary, the redistribution is driven by ligand&#8208;induced G4 folding and trapping of dynamically populated short&#8208;lived conformation states. Thus, ligand&#8208;induced stabilization does not necessarily require the initial presence of stably folded G4s.

         <title>Inorganic Enzyme Mimics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Making a difference: Inorganic enzyme mimics, mainly consisting of inorganic complexes and nanozymes, have attracted much interest and found widespread applications in healthcare, energy, and environmental fields. Because of their splendid properties, such as high stability, tailorable activity and low cost, these enzyme mimics are making and will continue to make a big difference in future science and technology.







Abstract
Enzyme mimics (or artificial enzymes) have emerged as valuable alternatives to natural enzymes since the pioneering work of Ronald Breslow. They have numerous advantages over natural enzymes, such as high stability, low cost, and tailorable activity. Among varieties of materials explored to mimic enzymes, the inorganic ones, including inorganic complexes and nanomaterials, have attracted increasing interest over the last decade and have the potential to address the current challenges in energy, environment, health, etc.

         <title>Two triterpene synthases from Imperata cylindrica catalyzing the formation of a pair of diastereoisomers through boat or chair cyclization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imperata cylindrica  is known to produce a pair of triterpenes, isoarborinol and fernenol, that exhibit identical planar structures but possess opposite stereochemistry at six of the nine chiral centers. These differences arise from a  boat  or a  chair  cyclization of the B&#8208;ring of the substrate. Here, we report the characterization of three OSC genes from  I. cylindrica  . IcOSC1 and IcOSC5 were identified as isoarborinol and fernenol synthases, respectively, while IcOSC3 was characterized as a multifunctional enzyme that produces glutinol and friedelin as its major products. Mutational studies of isoarborinol and fernenol synthases revealed that the residues surrounding the DCTAE motif partially affected the conformation of the B&#8208;ring during cyclization. Additionally, the IcOSC1&#8208;W255H mutant produced the rare triterpene boehmerol. The introduced histidine residue presumably abstracted a proton during the intermediary carbocation at C18 during the 1,2&#8208;rearrangement processes. Expression analysis indicated that all OSC genes were highly expressed in stems.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation, Structure, Biosynthesis and Bioactivity of Glidobactin&#8208;like Proteasome Inhibitors from Photorhabdus laumondii</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The silent treatment: Glidobactin&#8208;like proteasome inhibitors are regarded as promising candidates for anticancer drug development. We report the largest subset of glidobactin&#8208;like proteasome inhibitors, which are produced and identified after the silent biosynthetic gene cluster plu1881&#8211;1877 is activated in the native host P. laumondii.







Abstract
The glidobactin&#8208;like natural products (GLNPs) glidobactin&#8197;A and cepafungin&#8197;I have been reported to be potent proteasome inhibitors and are regarded as promising candidates for anticancer drug development. Their biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) plu1881&#8211;1877 is present in entomopathogenic Photorhabdus laumondii but silent under standard laboratory conditions. Here we show the largest subset of GLNPs, which are produced and identified after activation of the silent BGC in the native host and following heterologous expression of the BGC in Escherichia coli. Their chemical diversity results from a relaxed substrate specificity and flexible product release in the assembly line of GLNPs. Crystal structure analysis of the yeast proteasome in complex with new GLNPs suggests that the degree of unsaturation and the length of the aliphatic tail are critical for their bioactivity. The results in this study provide the basis to engineer the BGC for the generation of new GLNPs and to optimize these natural products resulting in potential drugs for cancer therapy.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis and Biological Applications of O&#8208;GlcNAcylated Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sugar modifications on proteins enable cells to respond quickly to environmental cues. We review the plethora of chemical strategies to access precise glycoforms of O&#8208;GlcNAc peptides and full proteins and explore the translational use of synthetic O&#8208;GlcNAc glycopeptides and glycoproteins as biomarkers, mechanistic probes, and therapeutics. Synthetic O&#8208;GlcNAc glycobiology is poised to rapidly identify roles in chronic and infectious disease.







Abstract
All human cells use O&#8208;GlcNAc protein modifications (O&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetylglucosamine) to rapidly adapt to changing nutrient and stress conditions through signaling, epigenetic, and proteostasis mechanisms. A key challenge for biologists in defining precise roles for specific O&#8208;GlcNAc sites is synthetic access to homogenous isoforms of O&#8208;GlcNAc proteins, a result of the non&#8208;genetically templated, transient, and heterogeneous nature of O&#8208;GlcNAc modifications. Toward a solution, this review details the state of the art of two strategies for O&#8208;GlcNAc protein modification: advances in &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; O&#8208;GlcNAc peptide synthesis and direct &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; installation of O&#8208;GlcNAc on full proteins. We also describe key applications of synthetic O&#8208;GlcNAc peptide and protein tools as therapeutics, biophysical structure&#8211;function studies, biomarkers, and as disease mechanistic probes to advance translational O&#8208;GlcNAc biology.

         <title>Recent Advances in Two&#8208;Photon AIEgens and Their Application in Biological Systems</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improving potential: Two&#8208;photon AIEgen probes have attracted a lot of attention due to their advantages of large penetration depth, little light damage, dark field imaging and target excitation. This paper reviews the most representative two&#8208;photon imaging technology of the past five years, and discusses its great application potential in the field of biological imaging.







Abstract
Two&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging technology has the advantages of high light stability, little light damage, and high spatiotemporal resolution, which make it a powerful biological analysis method. However, due to the high concentration or aggregation state of traditional organic light&#8208;emitting molecules, the fluorescence intensity is easily reduced or disappears completely, and is not conducive to optimal application. The concept of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) provides a solution to the problem of aggregation&#8208;induced luminescence quenching (ACQ), and realizes the high fluorescence quantum yield of luminescent molecules in the aggregation state. In addition, two&#8208;photon absorption properties can readily be improved just by increasing the loading content of AIE fluorogen (AIEgen). Therefore, the design and preparation of two&#8208;photon fluorescence probes based on AIEgen to achieve high&#8208;efficiency fluorescence imaging in&#8197;vitro/in&#8197;vivo has become a major research hotspot. This review aims to summarize representative two&#8208;photon AIEgens based on triphenylamine, tetraphenylethene, quinoline, naphthalene and other new structures from the past five years, and discuss their great potential in bioimaging applications.

         <title>IsPETase Is a Novel Biocatalyst for Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hitting the bottle: IsPETase is receiving increased attention for its ability to degrade crystalline PET, a major cause of plastic pollution. This review summarizes the current state of investigation into IsPETase and puts forward the necessity of utilizing and engineering IsPETase for industrial applications.







Abstract
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is one of the most widely used synthetic polyesters, but also a major cause of plastic pollution. Because the chemical degradation of PET would be uneconomical and rather burdensome, considerable efforts have been devoted to exploring enzymatic processes for the disposal of PET waste. Many PET&#8208;hydrolyzing enzymes have been reported in recent decades, some of which demonstrate excellent potential for industrial applications. This review sets out to summarize the state of investigation into IsPETase, a cutinase&#8208;like enzyme from Ideonella sakaiensis possessing ability to degrade crystalline PET, and to gain further insight into the structure&#8211;function relationship of IsPETase. Benefiting from the continuing identification of novel cutinase&#8208;like proteins and growing availability of the engineered IsPETase, we may anticipate future developments in this type of enzyme would generate suitable biocatalyst for industrial use.

         <title>Inducible CRISPR&#8208;dCas9 Transcriptional Systems for Sensing and Genome Regulation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transforming transcription: Inducible CRISPR&#8208;dCas9 transcription systems that rely on exogenous and endogenous cues to conditionally control the function of dCas9 proteins or gRNAs have provided pioneering platforms for genome engineering, cell&#8208;specific sensing and therapies.







Abstract
The clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats&#8208;associated protein 9 endonuclease (CRISPR&#8208;Cas9) and the nuclease&#8208;deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) systems have revolutionized our ability to precisely engineer and regulate genomes. Inducible CRISPR&#8208;dCas9&#8208;based transcriptional systems have been rapidly developed to conditionally control genetic manipulation. Current strategies mainly focus on conditional control of gRNA function and dCas9 protein using exogenous and endogenous triggers, including external light, small molecules, synthetic and intracellular oligonucleotides. These strategies have established novel platforms for the spatiotemporal regulation of genome activation and repression, epigenome editing, and so on. Herein, we summarize the recent progress in conditionally controlling CRISPR&#8208;dCas9 transcriptional systems through gRNA modulation and dCas9 protein engineering.

         <title>Superior Proton&#8208;Transfer Catalytic Promiscuity of Cytochrome&#8197;c in Self&#8208;Organized Media</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The evolutionary drive towards specificity has developed individual enzymes for specific reactions; however, some ancient proteins/enzymes display promiscuous substrate specificity, which is central theme of the image. We have shown that cytochrome c, one of the oldest members of the protein family, known for electron transport and peroxidative properties in lipid membranes, is also capable of performing proton transfer, but only in membrane&#8208;mimetic media. We discovered that His18, close to the hemin group, is mainly responsible for proton abstraction. This result is not only important in evolutionary perspectives, but also exemplifies the differential behavior of biomolecules in response to their surroundings. More information can be found in the full paper by S. Maiti et&#8197;al.

         <title>Investigation of vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 hydroxylation by Kutzneria albida</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The active vitamin D metabolites 25&#8208;OH&#8208;D and 1&#945;,25&#8208;(OH)  2  &#8208;D play an essential role in controlling several cellular processes in the human body and are potentially effective in the treatment of several diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The microbial synthesis of vitamin D  2  (VD  2  ) and vitamin D  3  (VD  3  ) metabolites has emerged as a suitable alternative to established complex chemical syntheses. In this study, a novel strain,  Kutzneria albida  , was identified, showing the ability to form 25&#8208;OH&#8208;D  2  and 25&#8208;OH&#8208;D  3  . To further improve the conversion of the poorly soluble substrates, several solubilizers were tested. 100&#8208;fold higher product concentrations of 25&#8208;OH&#8208;D  3  and 10&#8208;fold higher concentrations of 25&#8209;OH&#8208;D  2  after addition of 5% (w/v) 2&#8208;hydroxypropyl &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (2&#8208;HP&#946;CD) were reached. Besides the single hydroxylation products, the human double hydroxylation products 1,25&#8208;(OH)  2  &#8208;D  2  and 1,25&#8208;(OH)  2  &#8208;D  3  and various other potential single and double hydroxylation products were detected. Thus,  K. albida  represents a promising strain for the biotechnological production of VD  2  and VD  3  metabolites.</dc:description>

To further improve the conversion of the poorly soluble substrates, several solubilizers were tested. 100&#8208;fold higher product concentrations of 25&#8208;OH&#8208;D  3  and 10&#8208;fold higher concentrations of 25&#8209;OH&#8208;D  2  after addition of 5% (w/v) 2&#8208;hydroxypropyl &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (2&#8208;HP&#946;CD) were reached. Besides the single hydroxylation products, the human double hydroxylation products 1,25&#8208;(OH)  2  &#8208;D  2  and 1,25&#8208;(OH)  2  &#8208;D  3  and various other potential single and double hydroxylation products were detected. Thus,  K. albida  represents a promising strain for the biotechnological production of VD  2  and VD  3  metabolites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Probing the interaction of huntingtin exon&#8208;1 polypeptides with the chaperonin nanomachine GroEL</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Huntington&#8217;s disease arises from polyQ expansion within the exon&#8208;1 region of huntingtin (htt  ex1  ), resulting in an aggregation prone protein that accumulates in neuronal inclusion bodies. We investigate the interaction of various htt  ex1  constructs with the bacterial analog (GroEL) of the human chaperonin Hsp60. Using fluorescence spectroscopy and electron and atomic force microscopy we show that GroEL inhibits fibril formation. The binding kinetics of htt  ex1  constructs with intact GroEL and a mini&#8208;chaperone comprising the apical domain is characterized by relaxation&#8208;based NMR measurements. The lifetimes of the complexes range from 100&#8208;400 m s with equilibrium dissociation constants (  K  D  ) of &#160;~1&#8208;2 mM. The binding interface is formed by the N&#8208;terminal amphiphilic region of htt  ex1  (which adopts a partially helical conformation) and the H and I helices of the GroEL apical domain. Sequestration of monomeric htt  ex1  by GroEL likely increases the critical concentration required for fibrillization.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing multiple, non&#8208;proteogenic substitutions to optimize CSP:ComD hydrophobic interactions in group1 Streptococcus pneumoniae</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Streptococcus pneumoniae  (pneumococcus) is a human pathobiont that causes drastic antibiotic&#8208;resistant infections and is responsible for millions of deaths universally. Pneumococcus pathogenicity relies on the competence stimulating peptide (CSP) &#8208; mediated quorum sensing (QS) pathway that controls competence development for genetic transformation and, consequently, the spread of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. Modulation of QS in  S. pneumoniae  can therefore be utilized to enervate pneumococcal infectivity as well as minimize the susceptibility for resistance development. In this work, we sought to optimize the interaction of CSP1 with its cognate transmembrane histidine kinase receptor (ComD1) through substitution of proteogenic and non&#8208;proteogenic amino acids on the hydrophobic binding face of CSP1. The findings from this study not only provided additional structure&#8208;activity data that are significant in optimizing CSP1 potency, but also led to the development of potent QS modulators. These CSP&#8208;based QS modulators could be used as privileged scaffolds for the development of antimicrobial agents against pneumococcal infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies for Site&#8208;Specific Labeling of Receptor Proteins on the Surfaces of Living Cells by Using Genetically Encoded Peptide Tags</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescence microscopy imaging provides information about the localization and trafficking of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases. To visualize these proteins, reporter groups must be introduced on the surface of live cells. This review discusses live&#8208;cell protein labelling by small, genetically encoded peptide tags serving as enzyme substrates or recognition sites for interactions with proteins, coiled&#8208;coil peptides and metal reagents.







Abstract
Fluorescence microscopy imaging enables receptor proteins to be investigated within their biological context. A key challenge is to site&#8208;specifically incorporate reporter moieties into proteins without interfering with biological functions or cellular networks. Small peptide tags offer the opportunity to combine inducible labeling with small tag sizes that avoid receptor perturbation. Herein, we review the current state of live&#8208;cell labeling of peptide&#8208;tagged cell&#8208;surface proteins. Considering their importance as targets in medicinal chemistry, we focus on membrane receptors such as G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). We discuss peptide tags that i) are subject to enzyme&#8208;mediated modification reactions, ii) guide the complementation of reporter proteins, iii) form coiled&#8208;coil complexes, and iv) interact with metal complexes. Given our own contributions in the field, we place emphasis on peptide&#8208;templated labeling chemistry.

         <title>Unveiling the Potential of Transition Metal Complexes for Medicine: Translational in Situ Activation of Metal&#8208;Based Drugs from Bench to in Vivo Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control and select: Novel metal&#8208;based drugs for treating diverse diseases have recently been under the spotlight. Fine control of off&#8208;targeted toxic effects was achieved by using a variety of stabilized coordination ligands along with different metal centers. Herein, we highlight the versatile, effective and valuable use of transition metals in medicine, namely for in&#8197;situ activation of metal&#8208;based drugs.







Abstract
The development of metal&#8208;based anticancer drugs has been hampered, among other reasons, by their lack of selectivity for cancer cells. In a recent article, Zou and co&#8208;workers presented the successful intracellular activation of organogold(I) complexes for potential cancer treatment through Pd(II)&#8208;mediated transmetallation, overcoming some off&#8208;target activity of novel gold&#8208;based drugs. This unique strategy builds the perfect bridge between metallodrug usage and bioorthogonal intracellular catalysis for more advanced and selective therapies. Such an approach will hopefully pave the way for forthcoming studies in medicinal inorganic chemistry.

         <title>Reversible Control of Gelatin Hydrogel Stiffness by Using DNA Crosslinkers**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going soft: We report a gelatin methacrylate hydrogel crosslinked with DNA. The stiffness of the gel can be switched by a factor of &#8764;2, over two cycles, by using displacement strands, with no degradation of gel performance. Using two DNA sequences allows orthogonal control of gel stiffness and ligand presentation.







Abstract
Biomaterials with dynamically tunable properties are critical for a range of applications in regenerative medicine and basic biology. In this work, we show the reversible control of gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel stiffness through the use of DNA crosslinkers. We replaced some of the inter&#8208;GelMA crosslinks with double&#8208;stranded DNA, allowing for their removal through toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement. The crosslinks could be restored by adding fresh dsDNA with complementary handles to those on the hydrogel. The elastic modulus (G&#8217;) of the hydrogels could be tuned between 500 and 1000&#8197;Pa, reversibly, over two cycles without degradation of performance. By functionalizing the gels with a second DNA strand, it was possible to control the crosslink density and a model ligand in an orthogonal fashion with two different displacement strands. Our results demonstrate the potential for DNA to reversibly control both stiffness and ligand presentation in a protein&#8208;based hydrogel, and will be useful for teasing apart the spatiotemporal behavior of encapsulated cells.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution DNA Dual&#8208;Rulers Reveal a New Intermediate State in Ribosomal Frameshifting</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Branch line: Precise DNA rulers were developed to investigate the mechanism of ribosomal frameshifting. Based on super&#8208;resolution force spectroscopy, they revealed nucleic acid motion with subnucleotide resolution. New intermediate states were identified, one of which differed from the conventional state by less than a single nucleotide. Our work contributes towards understanding branching among different reading frames during protein synthesis.







Abstract
Ribosomal frameshifting is an important pathway used by many viruses for protein synthesis that involves mRNA translocation of various numbers of nucleotides. Resolving the mRNA positions with subnucleotide precision will provide critical mechanistic information that is difficult to obtain with current techniques. We report a method of high&#8208;resolution DNA rulers with subnucleotide precision and the discovery of new frameshifting intermediate states on mRNA containing a GA7G motif. Two intermediate states were observed with the aid of fusidic acid, one at the &#8220;0&#8221; reading frame and the other near the &#8220;&#8722;1&#8221; reading frame, in contrast to the &#8220;&#8722;2&#8221; and &#8220;&#8722;1&#8221; frameshifting products found in the absence of the antibiotic.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Branch line&lt;/b&gt;: Precise DNA rulers were developed to investigate the mechanism of ribosomal frameshifting. Based on super&#8208;resolution force spectroscopy, they revealed nucleic acid motion with subnucleotide resolution. New intermediate states were identified, one of which differed from the conventional state by less than a single nucleotide. Our work contributes towards understanding branching among different reading frames during protein synthesis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ribosomal frameshifting is an important pathway used by many viruses for protein synthesis that involves mRNA translocation of various numbers of nucleotides. Resolving the mRNA positions with subnucleotide precision will provide critical mechanistic information that is difficult to obtain with current techniques. We report a method of high&#8208;resolution DNA rulers with subnucleotide precision and the discovery of new frameshifting intermediate states on mRNA containing a GA&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;G motif. Two intermediate states were observed with the aid of fusidic acid, one at the &#8220;0&#8221; reading frame and the other near the &#8220;&#8722;1&#8221; reading frame, in contrast to the &#8220;&#8722;2&#8221; and &#8220;&#8722;1&#8221; frameshifting products found in the absence of the antibiotic. We termed the new near&#8208;&#8220;&#8722;1&#8221; intermediate the Post(&#8722;1*) state because it was shifted by approximately half a nucleotide compared to the normal &#8220;&#8722;1&#8221; reading frame at the 5&#8217;&#8208;end. This indicates a ribosome conformation that is different from the conventional model of three reading frames. Our work reveals uniquely precise mRNA motions and subtle conformational changes that will complement structural and fluorescence studies.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Insight into the Mechanism of Action and Peptide&#8208;Membrane Interactions of Aib&#8208;Rich Peptides: Multitechnique Experimental and Theoretical Analysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sit up or lie down: Linear dichroism, circular dichroism and Raman spectroscopy, neutron reflectivity and molecular dynamics simulations have been used to explore how mimics of peptaibol antibiotics (Aib foldamers) interact with membranes. These studies revealed all peptides partitioned well into the bilayers, with orientation dependent upon peptide length, as well as chiral interactions between peptides and the phospholipids.







Abstract
The increase in resistant bacterial strains necessitates the identification of new antimicrobial molecules. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are an attractive option because of evidence that bacteria cannot easily develop resistance to AMPs. The peptaibols, a class of naturally occurring AMPs, have shown particular promise as antimicrobial drugs, but their development has been hindered by their mechanism of action not being clearly understood. To explore how peptaibols might interact with membranes, circular dichroism, vibrational circular dichroism, linear dichroism, Raman spectroscopy, Raman optical activity, neutron reflectivity and molecular dynamics simulations have been used to study a small library of peptaibol mimics, the Aib&#8208;rich peptides. All the peptides studied quickly partitioned and oriented in membranes, and we found evidence of chiral interactions between the phospholipids and membrane&#8208;embedded peptides. The protocols presented in this paper open new ground by showing how chiro&#8208;optical spectroscopies can throw light on the mechanism of action of AMPs.

         <title>Antimicrobial and Anticancer Properties of Synthetic Peptides Derived from the Wasp Parachartergus fraternus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Where is thy sting? Wasp venom&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;helical peptides and analogues were tested for antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity. The analogues were less toxic to cells and could accumulate inside cancer cells. Protonectin&#8208;F kills cancer cells and bacteria whereas neuroVAL is a nontoxic cell&#8208;penetrating peptide.







Abstract
Agelaia&#8208;MPI and protonectin are antimicrobial peptides isolated from the wasp Parachartergus fraternus that show antimicrobial and neuroactive activities. Previously, two analogues of these peptides, neuroVAL and protonectin&#8208;F, were designed to reduce nonspecific toxicity and improve potency. Here, the three&#8208;dimensional structures of neuroVAL, protonectin and protonectin&#8208;F were determined by using circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy. Antibacterial, antifungal, cytotoxic and hemolytic activities were tested for the parent peptides and analogues. All peptides showed moderate antimicrobial activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, with agelaia&#8208;MPI being the most active. Protonectin and protonectin&#8208;F were found to be toxic to cancerous and noncancerous cell lines. Internalization experiments revealed that these peptides accumulate inside both cell types. By contrast, neuroVAL was nontoxic to all tested cells and was able to enter cells without accumulating. In summary, neuroVAL has potential as a nontoxic cell&#8208;penetrating peptide, while protonectin&#8208;F needs further modification to realize its potential as an antitumor peptide.

         <title>The Antimicrobial Peptide Gad&#8208;1 Clears Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms under Cystic Fibrosis Conditions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a metal&#8208;mediated mode of action, the metallo&#8208;antimicrobial peptide Gad&#8208;1 can effectively clear P. aeruginosa biofilms. In the presence of Cu2+ ions, Gad&#8208;1 rapidly cleaves the exogenous DNA that allows biofilms to thrive. Anti&#8208;biofilm activity was observed at a range of pH, ionic strength, and in the presence of exogenous DNA, conditions relevant to cystic fibrosis.







Abstract
Bacterial infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are an emerging health issue and lead to a premature death. CF is a hereditary disease that creates a thick mucus in the lungs that is prone to bacterial biofilm formation, specifically Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. These biofilms are very difficult to treat because many of them have antibiotic resistance that is worsened by the presence of extracellular DNA (eDNA). eDNA helps to stabilize biofilms and can bind antimicrobial compounds to lessen their effects. The metallo&#8208;antimicrobial peptide Gaduscidin&#8208;1 (Gad&#8208;1) eradicates established P. aeruginosa biofilms through a combination of modes of action that includes nuclease activity that can cleave eDNA in biofilms. In addition, Gad&#8208;1 exhibits synergistic activity when used with the antibiotics kanamycin and ciprofloxacin, thus making Gad&#8208;1 a new lead compound for the potential treatment of bacterial biofilms in CF patients.

         <title>Cleavage of an RNA Model Compound by an Arylmercury Complex</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soluble, but not so speedy: The potential of an water&#8208;soluble arylmercury compound to cleave RNA has been explored. The somewhat low catalytic activity compared to free HgII was attributed to the relatively low affinity of the arylmercury catalyst for the RNA model compound. This suggests that improved derivatives could be obtained by covalent tethering to an appropriate targeting group.







Abstract
A water&#8208;soluble arylmercury complex has been synthesized, and its ability to catalyze the cleavage of the phosphodiester linkage of the RNA model compound adenylyl&#8208;3&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;methyleneadenosine) has been assessed over a pH range of 3&#8211;8.5 and a catalyst concentration range of 0&#8211;7&#8197;mM. In the presence of 1&#8197;mM catalyst, the observed pH&#8211;rate profile featured a new pH&#8208;independent region between pH&#8197;6 and 7, the catalyzed reaction being as much as eight times faster than the background reaction. At pH&#8197;7, the acceleration increased linearly from three&#8208; to 17&#8208;fold upon increasing the catalyst concentration from 1 to 7&#8197;mM. The linear dependence indicates a relatively low affinity of the catalyst for the substrate and, hence, the potential for considerable improvement on tethering to an appropriate targeting group, such as an oligonucleotide.

         <title>DNA Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization Driven by Base Stacking</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An open and shut case: A new system of DNA supramolecular polymerization driven by DNA base stacking together with a sequence symmetry design strategy is demonstrated. In this system, a unique component strand first formed a dimeric ring and one opener strand opened it to initiate the polymerization.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers, relying on reversible intermolecular interactions, promise a wide range of applications, including optoelectronic materials, self&#8208;healing materials, and biomedical delivery materials. Among potential molecular candidates, DNA strands act as an excellent platform. DNA has a well&#8208;established secondary structure (double helix), and its intermolecular interactions can be readily thermodynamically engineered and kinetically controlled. Extensive studies have demonstrated that various DNA motifs can polymerize/assemble into large polymers with different topology, geometry, and dimensionalities. Most of the reported polymerization is driven by hybridization of DNA strands. Herein, we report a novel system of DNA supramolecular polymerization that is driven by DNA base stacking. The polymerization has been confirmed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). We believe that this work will expand the toolbox for DNA supramolecular polymerization and would, with further development, increase further control of DNA supramolecular polymerization.

In this system, a unique component strand first formed a dimeric ring and one opener strand opened it to initiate the polymerization.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular polymers, relying on reversible intermolecular interactions, promise a wide range of applications, including optoelectronic materials, self&#8208;healing materials, and biomedical delivery materials. Among potential molecular candidates, DNA strands act as an excellent platform. DNA has a well&#8208;established secondary structure (double helix), and its intermolecular interactions can be readily thermodynamically engineered and kinetically controlled. Extensive studies have demonstrated that various DNA motifs can polymerize/assemble into large polymers with different topology, geometry, and dimensionalities. Most of the reported polymerization is driven by hybridization of DNA strands. Herein, we report a novel system of DNA supramolecular polymerization that is driven by DNA base stacking. The polymerization has been confirmed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). We believe that this work will expand the toolbox for DNA supramolecular polymerization and would, with further development, increase further control of DNA supramolecular polymerization.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Stable Hairpin Structures Formed by Xylose&#8208;Based Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable ladder: Thermal and spectroscopic analyses of xylose (XyNA) and deoxyxylose nucleic acids (dXyNA) indicate the formation of stable hairpin structures. The solution structure of a fully modified dXyNA hairpin indicates the structural preference for a ladder&#8208;like stem with a noncanonical loop.







Abstract
Xenobiology explores synthetic nucleic acid polymers as alternative carriers of genetic information to expand the central dogma. The xylo&#8208; and deoxyxylo&#8208;nucleic acids (XyNA and dXyNA), containing 3&#8217; epimers of riboses and deoxyriboses, are considered to be potential candidates for an orthogonal system. In this study, thermal and spectroscopic analyses show that XyNA and dXyNA form stable hairpins. The dXyNA hairpin structure determined by NMR spectroscopy contains a flexible loop that locks the stem into a stable ladder&#8208;like duplex with marginal right&#8208;handed helicity. The reduced flexibility of the dXyNA duplex observed in the stem of the hairpin demonstrates that folding of dXyNA yields more stable structures described so far.

         <title>Photoregulation of Gene Expression with Ligand&#8208;Modified Caged siRNAs through Host/Guest Interaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bigger cage, bigger effect: Photomodulation of gene expression has been successfully achieved in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo by using guest&#8208;molecule&#8208;modified caged siRNAs, which contains the corresponding bulky blocking complex at 5&#8242; terminus of the antisense RNA strand, through guest/host interactions.







Abstract
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) can effectively silence target genes through Argonate 2 (Ago2)&#8208;induced RNA interference (RNAi). It is very important to control siRNA activity in both spatial and temporal modes. Among different masking strategies, photocaging can be used to regulate gene expression through light irradiation with spatiotemporal and dose&#8208;dependent resolution. Many different caging strategies and caging groups have been reported for light&#8208;activated siRNA gene silencing. Herein, we describe a novel caging strategy that increases the blocking effect of RISC complex formation/process through host/guest (including ligand/receptor) interactions, thereby enhancing the inhibition of caged siRNA activity until light activation. This strategy can be used as a general approach to design caged siRNAs for the photomodulation of gene silencing of exogenous and endogenous genes.

         <title>RNA&#8208;Cleaving DNA Thresholder Controlled by Concentrations of miRNA Cancer Marker</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On a high: We have developed a deoxyribozyme&#8208;based thresholder (DTh) that distinguishes the high levels of miR markers found in cancer cells from the low levels found in healthy cells and cleaves another, vital RNA. The DTh constructs showed the expected response to different concentrations of a neuroblastoma marker, exhibiting efficient cleavage of long RNA molecules with high selectivity.







Abstract
Oligonucleotide gene therapy (OGT) agents suppress specific mRNAs in cells and thus reduce the expression of targeted genes. The ability to unambiguously distinguish cancer from healthy cells can solve the low selectivity problem of OGT agents. Cancer RNA markers are expressed in both healthy and cancer cells with a higher expression level in cancer cells. We have designed a DNA&#8208;based construct, named DNA thresholder (DTh) that cleaves targeted RNA only at high concentrations of cancer marker RNA and demonstrates low cleavage activity at low marker concentrations. The RNA&#8208;cleaving activity can be adjusted within one order of magnitude of the cancer marker RNA concentration by simply redesigning DTh. Importantly, DTh recognizes cancer marker RNA, while cleaving targeted RNA; this offers a possibility to suppress vital genes exclusively in cancer cells, thus triggering their death. DTh is a prototype of computation&#8208;inspired molecular device for controlling gene expression and cancer treatment.

         <title>Tagged Benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;Ones as Novel Activity&#8208;Based Probes for Serine Proteases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1&#8208;step synthesis, 2&#8208;step labeling: Alkyne&#8208;conjugated benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones are easily accessible in a 1&#8208;step synthesis from substituted anthranilic acid derivatives. They make novel activity&#8208;based probes that covalently react with serine proteases and allow read&#8208;out by copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition.







Abstract
Activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs) are valuable chemical tools for profiling enzymes. They have been particularly useful in the study of proteases. ABPs rely on electrophilic scaffolds that covalently modify the target enzymes. Ideally, they can be made in a fast and uncomplicated manner. Here, we explore alkyne&#8208;substituted benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones as ABPs for serine proteases, because they inhibitserine proteases covalently and their synthesis is very straightforward. We show that alkyne&#8208;tagged benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones can be used in two&#8208;step bioorthogonal tandem labeling procedures or pre&#8208;functionalized with a biotin or fluorophore. We demonstrate that these reagents can be used to label and identify various serine proteases. Therefore, we expect that tagged benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones will offer easily synthesizable tools for profiling of serine proteases.

         <title>SP3&#8208;FAIMS Chemoproteomics for High&#8208;Coverage Profiling of the Human Cysteinome**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Versatile verification: A new cysteine chemoproteomic method enables rapid and high&#8208;coverage analysis of the human cysteinome. By combining enhanced cysteine biotinylation with SP3 sample decontamination and FAIMS on&#8208;line fraction, we identified in aggregate 34225 unique cysteines found on 7243 proteins. Integration with the isoTOP&#8208;ABPP workflow enabled the high&#8208;throughput discovery of cysteines labeled by electrophilic compounds.







Abstract
Chemoproteomics has enabled the rapid and proteome&#8208;wide discovery of functional, redox&#8208;sensitive, and ligandable cysteine residues. Despite widespread adoption and considerable advances in both sample&#8208;preparation workflows and MS instrumentation, chemoproteomics experiments still typically only identify a small fraction of all cysteines encoded by the human genome. Here, we develop an optimized sample&#8208;preparation workflow that combines enhanced peptide labeling with single&#8208;pot, solid&#8208;phase&#8208;enhanced sample&#8208;preparation (SP3) to improve the recovery of biotinylated peptides, even from small sample sizes. By combining this improved workflow with on&#8208;line high&#8208;field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) separation of labeled peptides, we achieve unprecedented coverage of &gt;14000 unique cysteines in a single&#8208;shot 70&#8197;min experiment. Showcasing the wide utility of the SP3&#8208;FAIMS chemoproteomic method, we find that it is also compatible with competitive small&#8208;molecule screening by isotopic tandem orthogonal proteolysis&#8211;activity&#8208;based protein profiling (isoTOP&#8208;ABPP). In aggregate, our analysis of 18 samples from seven cell lines identified 34225 unique cysteines using only &#8764;28&#8197;h of instrument time. The comprehensive spectral library and improved coverage provided by the SP3&#8208;FAIMS chemoproteomics method will provide the technical foundation for future studies aimed at deciphering the functions and druggability of the human cysteineome.

         <title>Secondary Alcohol Dehydrogenases from Thermoanaerobacter pseudoethanolicus and Thermoanaerobacter brockii as Robust Catalysts</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) represent an important type of enzymes that have significant applications as biocatalysts. Secondary ADHs from Thermoanaerobacter pseudoethanolicus ( Te SADH) and from Thermoanaerobacter brockii ( Tb SADH) are well&#8208;known as robust catalysts. However, and like most other ADHs, these enzymes suffer from their high substrate specificities (i.e., limited substrate scope), which to some extent restricts their use as biocatalysts. This review discusses recent efforts to expand the substrate scope and tune enantioselectivity of Te SADH and Tb SADH using site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and directed evolution. Various examples of asymmetric synthesis of optically active alcohols using both enzymes are highlighted. Moreover, the unique thermal stability and organic solvent tolerance of these enzymes is illustrated by their concurrent inclusion with other interesting reactions to synthesize optically active alcohols and amines. For instance, Te SADH has been used in quantitative non&#8208;stereoselective oxidation of alcohols to accomplish deracemization of alcohols via cyclic deracemization and in racemization of enantiopure alcohols to accomplish a bienzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution.</dc:description>

         <title>An Artificial Cofactor Catalyzing the Baylis&#8208;Hillman Reaction with Designed Streptavidin as Protein Host**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A story in pictures: An artificial cofactor based on an organocatalyst was embedded in streptavidin to catalyze the Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction. The following protein design process was described by solved crystal structures for every design step, and the outcome of the chemical reaction was represented by using DFT calculations and MD simulations.







Abstract
An artificial cofactor based on an organocatalyst embedded in a protein has been used to conduct the Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction in a buffered system. As protein host, we chose streptavidin, as it can be easily crystallized and thereby supports the design process. The protein host around the cofactor was rationally designed on the basis of high&#8208;resolution crystal structures obtained after each variation of the amino acid sequence. Additionally, DFT&#8208;calculated intermediates and transition states were used to rationalize the observed activity. Finally, repeated cycles of structure determination and redesign led to a system with an up to one order of magnitude increase in activity over the bare cofactor and to the most active proteinogenic catalyst for the Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction known today.

         <title>Organomercury Nucleic Acids: Past, Present and Future</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organomercury renaissance: Research on the synthesis and applications of organomercury nucleic acids and their constituents is reviewed, with a focus on recent developments, such as efforts to improve the hybridization properties of oligonucleotide probes through HgII&#8208;mediated base pairing of covalently mercurated base moieties.







Abstract
Synthetic efforts towards nucleosides, nucleotides, oligonucleotides and nucleic acids covalently mercurated at one or more of their base moieties are summarized, followed by a discussion of the proposed, realized and abandoned applications of this unique class of compounds. Special emphasis is given to fields in which active research is ongoing, notably the use of HgII&#8208;mediated base pairing to improve the hybridization properties of oligonucleotide probes. Finally, this minireview attempts to anticipate potential future applications of organomercury nucleic acids.

         <title>Fragment&#8208;Based Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Screen against a Regulator of G Protein Signaling Identifies a Binding &#8220;Hot Spot&#8221;</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Altered expression of RGS17 leads to dysfunction in G&#8197;protein signaling, eventually altering the transcription of cancer&#8208;promoting proteins. Therefore, inhibiting RGS17 has potential as an anticancer therapy. We used an NMR FBLD approach to identify fragments capable of binding RGS17. Chemical&#8208;shift mapping of the 15N/1H HSQC spectra of 15N&#8208;labeled RGS17&#8208;RH identified a previously unknown putative fragment binding site on RGS17.







Abstract
Regulator of G&#8197;protein signaling (RGS) proteins have attracted attention as a result of their primary role in directing the specificity as well as the temporal and spatial aspects of G&#8197;protein&#8208;coupled receptor signaling. In addition, alterations in RGS protein expression have been observed in a number of disease states, including certain cancers. In this area, RGS17 is of particular interest. It has been demonstrated that, while RGS17 is expressed primarily in the central nervous system, it has been found to be inappropriately expressed in lung, prostate, breast, cervical, and hepatocellular carcinomas. Overexpression of RGS17 leads to dysfunction in inhibitory G&#8197;protein signaling and an overproduction of the intracellular second messenger cAMP, which in turn alters the transcription patterns of proteins known to promote various cancer types. Suppressing RGS17 expression with RNA interference (RNAi) has been found to decrease tumorigenesis and sufficiently prevents cancer cell migration, leading to the hypothesis that pharmacological blocking of RGS17 function could be useful in anticancer therapies. We have identified small&#8208;molecule fragments capable of binding the RGS homology (RH) domain of RGS17 by using a nuclear magnetic resonance fragment&#8208;based screening approach. By chemical shift mapping of the two&#8208;dimensional 15N,1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of the backbone&#8208;assigned 15N&#8208;labeled RGS17&#8208;RH, we determined the fragment binding sites to be distant from the G&#945; interface. Thus, our study identifies a putative fragment binding site on RGS17 that was previously unknown.

         <title>DNA&#8208;targeted metallodrugs: an untapped source of artificial gene editing technology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA binding metal complexes are synonymous with anticancer drug discovery. Given the array of structural and chemical reactivity properties available through careful design, metal complexes have been directed to bind nucleic acid structures through covalent or non&#8208;covalent binding modes. Several recognition modes&#8212;including crosslinking, intercalation, and oxidation&#8212;are central to the clinical success of broad&#8208;spectrum anticancer metallodrugs. However, recent progress in nucleic acid click chemistry coupled with advancement in our understanding of metal complex&#8208;nucleic acid interactions has opened up new avenues in genetic engineering and targeted therapies. Several of these applications are enabled by the hybridisation of oligonucleotide or polyamine probes to discrete metal complexes which facilitate site&#8208;specific reactivity at the nucleic acid interface under the guidance of the probe. This review focuses on recent advancements in hybrid design and, by way of an introduction to this topic, we provide a detailed overview of nucleic acid structures and metal complex&#8208;nucleic acid interactions. Our aim is to provide readers with an insight on the rational design of metal complexes with DNA recognition properties and an understanding of how the sequence&#8208;specific targeting of these interactions can be achieved for gene engineering applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise Post&#8208;glycosylation Modification of Sugar Moieties in Kanamycin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Step by step: A dehydrogenase KanQ oxidizes C&#8208;6&#8242;&#8208;OH of kanamycin&#8197;C more efficiently than 3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;deamino&#8208;3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;hydroxykanaymycin C or paromamine before introduction of C&#8208;6&#8242;&#8208;NH2, thus suggesting that the kanosamine moiety with C&#8208;3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;NH2 is strictly recognized by KanQ. Furthermore, oxygenase KanJ recognizes C&#8208;6&#8242;&#8208;NH2 of the pseudo&#8208;trisaccharide for deamination of C&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;NH2; this suggests that these modifications mainly occur in a stepwise manner.







Abstract
Kanamycin&#8197;A is the major 2&#8208;deoxystreptamine (2DOS)&#8208;containing aminoglycoside antibiotic produced by Streptomyces kanamyceticus. The 2DOS moiety is linked with 6&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;glucose (6ADG) at O&#8208;4 and 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;glucose at O&#8208;6. Because the 6ADG moiety is derived from d&#8208;glucosamine (GlcN), deamination at C&#8208;2 and introduction of C&#8208;6&#8208;NH2 are required in the biosynthesis. A dehydrogenase, KanQ, and an aminotransferase, KanB, are presumed to be responsible for the introduction of C&#8208;6&#8208;NH2, although the substrates have not been identified. Here, we examined the substrate specificity of KanQ to better understand the biosynthetic pathway. It was found that KanQ oxidized kanamycin&#8197;C more efficiently than the 3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;deamino derivative. Furthermore, the substrate specificity of an oxygenase, KanJ, that is responsible for deamination at C&#8208;2 of the GlcN moiety was examined, and the crystal structure of KanJ was determined. It was found that C&#8208;6&#8208;NH2 is important for substrate recognition by KanJ. Thus, the modification of the GlcN moiety occurs after pseudo&#8208;trisaccharide formation, followed by the introduction of C&#8208;6&#8208;NH2 by KanQ/KanB and deamination at C&#8208;2 by KanJ.

     alt="Stepwise Post&#8208;glycosylation Modification of Sugar Moieties in Kanamycin Biosynthesis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step by step&lt;/b&gt;: A dehydrogenase KanQ oxidizes C&#8208;6&#8242;&#8208;OH of kanamycin&#8197;C more efficiently than 3&#8242;&#8242;&lt;i&gt;&#8208;&lt;/i&gt;deamino&#8208;3&#8242;&#8242;&lt;i&gt;&#8208;&lt;/i&gt;hydroxykanaymycin C or paromamine before introduction of C&#8208;6&#8242;&#8208;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thus suggesting that the kanosamine moiety with C&#8208;3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is strictly recognized by KanQ. Furthermore, oxygenase KanJ recognizes C&#8208;6&#8242;&#8208;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of the pseudo&#8208;trisaccharide for deamination of C&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; this suggests that these modifications mainly occur in a stepwise manner.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kanamycin&#8197;A is the major 2&#8208;deoxystreptamine (2DOS)&#8208;containing aminoglycoside antibiotic produced by &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces kanamyceticus&lt;/i&gt;. The 2DOS moiety is linked with 6&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;glucose (6ADG) at O&#8208;4 and 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;glucose at O&#8208;6. Because the 6ADG moiety is derived from &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;glucosamine (GlcN), deamination at C&#8208;2 and introduction of C&#8208;6&#8208;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are required in the biosynthesis. A dehydrogenase, KanQ, and an aminotransferase, KanB, are presumed to be responsible for the introduction of C&#8208;6&#8208;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, although the substrates have not been identified. Here, we examined the substrate specificity of KanQ to better understand the biosynthetic pathway. It was found that KanQ oxidized kanamycin&#8197;C more efficiently than the 3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;deamino derivative. Furthermore, the substrate specificity of an oxygenase, KanJ, that is responsible for deamination at C&#8208;2 of the GlcN moiety was examined, and the crystal structure of KanJ was determined. It was found that C&#8208;6&#8208;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is important for substrate recognition by KanJ. Thus, the modification of the GlcN moiety occurs after pseudo&#8208;trisaccharide formation, followed by the introduction of C&#8208;6&#8208;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by KanQ/KanB and deamination at C&#8208;2 by KanJ.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Discovery of an Allosteric Ligand Binding Site in SMYD3 Lysine Methyltransferase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discovery of an allosteric ligand binding site in SMYD3 lysine methyltransferase (@BioChemInf, @HelenaDanielson, @UUBiochem, @UU&#8194;University)From a distance: SMYD3 lysine methyltransferase is an epigenetic enzyme with multiple cellular functions and the ability to recognize broad range of substrates from histones to cytosolic proteins. An SPR biosensors&#8208;based biophysical strategy for screening SMYD3 ligands was developed and revealed an allosteric binding site. Subsequent crystallographic studies provided a structural description of the novel binding site of SMYD3.







Abstract
SMYD3 is a multifunctional epigenetic enzyme with lysine methyltransferase activity and various interaction partners. It is implicated in the pathophysiology of cancers but with an unclear mechanism. To discover tool compounds for clarifying its biochemistry and potential as a therapeutic target, a set of drug&#8208;like compounds was screened in a biosensor&#8208;based competition assay. Diperodon was identified as an allosteric ligand; its R and S enantiomers were isolated, and their affinities to SMYD3 were determined (KD=42 and 84&#8197;&#956;M, respectively). Co&#8208;crystallization revealed that both enantiomers bind to a previously unidentified allosteric site in the C&#8208;terminal protein binding domain, consistent with its weak inhibitory effect. No competition between diperodon and HSP90 (a known SMYD3 interaction partner) was observed although SMYD3&#8211;HSP90 binding was confirmed (KD=13&#8197;&#956;M). Diperodon clearly represents a novel starting point for the design of tool compounds interacting with a druggable allosteric site, suitable for the exploration of noncatalytic SMYD3 functions and therapeutics with new mechanisms of action.

         <title>Luminescent Amphiphilic Aminoglycoside Probes to Study Transfection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transfection tracker: Conjugates of luminophores with aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties linked to the aminoglycoside tobramycin are reported. These compounds reveal an emission &#8220;on&#8221; behavior upon plasmid&#8208;DNA binding and are able to transfect different mammalian cell lines. The cellular uptake was investigated using the emission properties of the formed plasmid DNA&#8208;vector assemblies.







Abstract
We report the characterization of amphiphilic aminoglycoside conjugates containing luminophores with aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties as transfection reagents. These inherently luminescent transfection vectors are capable of binding plasmid DNA through electrostatic interactions; this binding results in an emission &#8220;on&#8221; signal due to restriction of intramolecular motion of the luminophore core. The luminescent cationic amphiphiles effectively transferred plasmid DNA into mammalian cells (HeLa, HEK 293T), as proven by expression of a red fluorescent protein marker. The morphologies of the aggregates were investigated by microscopy as well as &#950;&#8208;potential and dynamic light&#8208;scattering measurements. The transfection efficiencies using luminescent cationic amphiphiles were similar to that of the gold&#8208;standard transfection reagent Lipofectamine&#174; 2000.

         <title>Chemical Properties Determine Solubility and Stability in &#946;&#947;&#8208;Crystallins of the Eye Lens</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clear as crystallin? &#946;&#947;&#8208;crystallins serve as structural and refractive proteins in the vertebrate lens. Mutations in these proteins are associated with cataracts. Herein, we review recent developments toward understanding the biophysical properties and chemical reactivity of monomeric and oligomeric &#946;&#947; crystallins, including a discussion of the common techniques used to study crystallin structure and stability.







Abstract
&#946;&#947;&#8208;Crystallins are the primary structural and refractive proteins found in the vertebrate eye lens. Because crystallins are not replaced after early eye development, their solubility and stability must be maintained for a lifetime, which is even more remarkable given the high protein concentration in the lens. Aggregation of crystallins caused by mutations or post&#8208;translational modifications can reduce crystallin protein stability and alter intermolecular interactions. Common post&#8208;translational modifications that can cause age&#8208;related cataracts include deamidation, oxidation, and tryptophan derivatization. Metal ion binding can also trigger reduced crystallin solubility through a variety of mechanisms. Interprotein interactions are critical to maintaining lens transparency: crystallins can undergo domain swapping, disulfide bonding, and liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation, all of which can cause opacity depending on the context. Important experimental techniques for assessing crystallin conformation in the absence of a high&#8208;resolution structure include dye&#8208;binding assays, circular dichroism, fluorescence, light scattering, and transition metal FRET.

         <title>Activity&#8208;Based Protein Profiling of Bile Salt Hydrolysis in the Human Gut Microbiome with Beta&#8208;Lactam or Acrylamide&#8208;Based Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More than a gut feeling: The salts in bile, which aids digestion, can be modified by gut microbes. Bile salts act as signaling molecules, so structural modifications can impact host physiology. The microbial &#8220;gatekeeper&#8221; for bile salt modification is bile salt hydrolase (BSH). To uncover the molecular links between BSH and host health, novel activity&#8208;based probes for BSH were developed.







Abstract
Microbial bile salt hydrolases (BSHs) found in the intestine catalyze the deconjugation of taurine&#8208; and glycine&#8208;linked bile salts produced in the liver. The resulting bile salts are biological detergents and are critical in aiding lipophilic nutrient digestion. Therefore, the activity of BSHs in the gut microbiome is directly linked to human metabolism and overall health. Bile salt metabolism has also been associated with disease phenotypes such as liver and colorectal cancer. In order to reshape the gut microbiome to optimize bile salt metabolism, tools to characterize and quantify these processes must exist to enable a much&#8208;improved understanding of how metabolism goes awry in the face of disease, and how it can be improved through an altered lifestyle and environment. Furthermore, it is necessary to attribute metabolic activity to specific members and BSHs within the microbiome. To this end, we have developed activity&#8208;based probes with two different reactive groups to target bile salt hydrolases. These probes bind similarly to the authentic bile salt substrates, and we demonstrate enzyme labeling of active bile salt hydrolases by using purified protein, cell lysates, and in human stool.

         <title>Genetic Incorporation of Selenotyrosine Significantly Improves Enzymatic Activity of Agrobacterium radiobacter Phosphotriesterase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tyrosine plays important roles in many enzyme catalysts. To facilitate enzyme design, mechanistic studies and minimize structural perturbation in the active site, here we report the genetic incorporation of a novel unnatural amino acid selenotyrosine (SeHF), which has single atom replacement in comparison to tyrosine. The  Agrobacterium radiobacter  phosphotriesterase (  ar  PTE) Tyr309SeHF mutant exhibits a significant 12&#8208;fold increase in  k  cat  and 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in  k  cat  /  K  m  at pH 7.0.  Molecular dynamics simulation  shows that the SeHF309 mutation results in a conformational switch which opens up the product release pocket and increases the product release rate, thereby elevating the overall enzyme activity. Significant improvement of the catalytic efficiency at neutral pH by single unnatural amino acid (UAA) mutation broadens the application of this enzyme, and provides valuable insights to the mechanism. Our method represents a new approach for designing enzymes with enhanced activities.</dc:description>
