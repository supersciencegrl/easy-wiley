         <title>Short Oligourea Foldamers as N&#8208; or C&#8208;Caps for Promoting &#945;&#8208;Helix Formation in Water</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While foldamers have been extensively studied as protein mimics and especially as &#945;&#8208;helix mimics, their use as capping motif to enhance &#945;&#8208;helix propensity remains comparatively much limited. In this study, we leverage the structural similarities between urea&#8208;based helical foldamers and &#945;&#8208;helix to investigate the efficacy of oligoureas as N&#8208; or C&#8208;caps for reinforcing &#945;&#8208;helical structures in water. Short oligoureas, comprising 3 to 4 residues, were strategically introduced at the N&#8208; or C&#8208;terminus of two peptide sequences (S&#8208;peptide and an Ala&#8208;rich model sequence). The impact of these foldamer insertions on peptide conformation was examined using electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and solution NMR. This research identifies specific foldamer sequences capable of promoting a&#8208;helicity when incorporated at either terminus of the peptides. Not only does this work broaden the application scope of foldamers, but it also provides valuable insights into novel strategies for modulating peptide conformation in aqueous environments. The findings presented in this study may have implications for peptide design and the development of bioactive foldamer&#8208;based peptide mimics.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;Induced Suppression of PEG Crystallization from the Melt in a PEG&#8208;Peptide Conjugate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;CD) on crystallization of PEG in an amyloid peptide&#8208;PEG conjugate is investigated by SAXS/WAXS and DSC. The crystallization of PEG is suppressed (with sufficiently high &#945;CD content in the blends) due to complexation with &#945;CD, leading to hexagonal mesophase formation.







Abstract
The influence of alpha&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;CD) on PEG crystallization is examined for a peptide&#8208;PEG conjugate, YYKLVFF&#8208;PEG3k comprising an amyloid peptide YYKLVFF linked to PEG with molar mass 3&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Remarkably, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and simultaneous synchrotron small&#8208;angle/wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) show that crystallization of PEG is suppressed by &#945;CD, provided that the cyclodextrin content is sufficient. A hexagonal mesophase is formed instead. The &#945;CD threading reduces the conformational flexibility of PEG, and hence suppresses crystallization. These results show that addition of cyclodextrins can be used to tune the crystallization of peptide&#8208;polymer conjugates and potentially other polymer/biomolecular hybrids.

         <title>Catalytic and selective red light&#8208;triggered photodegradation of a G&#8208;quadruplex DNA by a zinc (II) phthalocyanine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;soluble phthalocyanine (Pc) derivatives have been regarded as potential G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) nucleic acid&#8208;targeting ligands for anticancer therapy and have been extensively studied as effective photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy (PDT). Understanding how photosensitizers interact with nucleic acids and the subsequent photolytic reactions is essential for deciphering the initial steps of PDT, thereby aiding in the development of new photosensitizing agents. In this study, we found that red&#8208;light irradiation of a mixture of a Zn(II) Pc derivative and an all&#8208;parallel G4 DNA leads to catalytic and selective photodegradation of the DNA by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the Zn(II) Pc derivative bound to DNA through a reaction mechanism similar to that of an enzyme reaction. This finding provides a novel insight into the molecular design of a photosensitizer to enhance its PDT efficacy.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing active fragments for drug discovery utilising nitroreductase biocatalysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biocatalysis has played a limited role in the early stages of drug discovery. This is often attributed to the limited substrate scope of enzymes not affording access to vast areas of novel chemical space. Here, we have shown a promiscuous nitroreductase enzyme (NR&#8208;55) can be used to produce a panel of functionalised anilines from a diverse panel of aryl nitro starting materials. After screening on analytical scale, we show that sixteen substrates could be scaled to 1 mmol scale, with several poly&#8208;functional anilines afforded with ease under the standard conditions. The aniline products were also screened for activity against several cell lines of interest, with modest activity observed for one compound. This study demonstrates the potential for nitroreductase biocatalysis to provide access to functional fragments under benign conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Tumor Acidity&#8208;Triggered Bioorthogonal Reactions for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer is one of the most serious threats to human health. Over the past few years, researchers have incrementally uncovered the pivotal role of tumor acidity in tumor formation, development and treatment through in&#8208;depth scientific research. In addition, bioorthogonal reactions have been widely used in tumor diagnosis and therapy, owing to their advantageous characteristics, including small ligand size, biocompatibility, fast reaction kinetics, and high chemospecificity. Consequently, bioorthogonal reactions triggered by tumor acidity have become an emerging strategy in biomedical applications. On this basis, we introduce the concept and major strategies of tumor acidity&#8208;triggered bioorthogonal reactions, and review their progress in biomedical applications, with a particular focus on their importance in disease diagnosis and treatment. Finally, clinical challenges and future trends are also outlooked.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of Photoexcited 2&#8208;Chloro&#8208;3,5&#8208;Dinitrobenzoic Acid as a Chemical Deprenylase of i6A RNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the efficient application of nitroaromatics in the chemical field, we have developed a novel reaction achieving direct deisopentenylation of i6A at the nucleotide level under blue light irradiation with high specific selectively and reaction efficiency. This method provided a photo&#8208;controlled intervention mode for the degradation of i6A. RNA modifications regulate gene expression and cellular homeostasis. Targeting RNA&#8208;modifying enzymes is a promising therapeutic strategy but faces challenges like unidentified enzymes and compensatory mechanisms. Chemical approaches offer alternatives. We have identified 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3,5&#8208;dinitrobenzoic acid as an effective photochemical deprenylase of i6A RNA, converting it to natural adenine, advancing RNA modification biology and therapeutic development.







Abstract
RNA modifications play crucial roles in regulating gene expression and cellular homeostasis. Modulating RNA modifications, particularly by targeting the enzymes responsible for their catalysis, has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. However, limitations, such as the lack of identified modifying enzymes and compensatory mechanisms, hinder targeted interventions. Chemical approaches independent of enzymatic activity offer an alternative strategy for RNA modification modulation. Here, we present the identification of 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3,5&#8208;dinitrobenzoic acid as a highly effective photochemical deprenylase of i6A RNA. This method demonstrates exceptional selectivity towards i6A, converting its substituent into a &#8220;N&#8208;doped&#8221; ozonide, which upon hydrolysis releases natural adenine. We believe that this chemical approach will pave the way for a better understanding of RNA modification biology and the development of novel therapeutic modalities.

         <title>Biocatalysis with In&#8208;Situ Product Removal Improves p&#8208;Coumaric Acid Production</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tyrosine ammonia lyase suffers from product inhibition, a common issue in biocatalytic processes. An aqueous two&#8208;phase system was developed for the extraction of the product p&#8208;coumaric acid at high pH. Immobilization of tyrosine ammonia lyase allowed for in&#8208;situ product removal in the aqueous two&#8208;phase system, improving the biocatalysis production metrics.







Abstract
Natural and pure p&#8208;coumaric acid has valuable applications, and it can be produced via bioprocessing. However, fermentation processes have so far been unable to provide sufficient production metrics, while a biocatalytic process decoupling growth and production historically showed much promise. This biocatalytic process is revisited in order to tackle product inhibition of the key enzyme tyrosine ammonia lyase. In situ product removal is proposed as a possible solution, and a polymer/salt aqueous two&#8208;phase system is identified as a suitable system for extraction of p&#8208;coumaric acid from an alkaline solution, with a partition coefficient of up to 13. However, a 10&#8201;% salt solution was found to reduce tyrosine ammonia lyase activity by 19&#8201;%, leading to the need for a more dilute system. The cloud points of two aqueous two&#8208;phase systems at 40&#8201;&#176;C and pH&#8197;10 were found to be 3.8&#8201;% salt and 9.5&#8201;% polymer, and a 5&#8201;% potassium phosphate and 12.5&#8201;% poly(ethylene glycol&#8208;ran&#8208;propylene glycol) mW~2500 system was selected for in&#8197;situ product removal. An immobilized tyrosine ammonia lyase biocatalyst in this aqueous two&#8208;phase system produced up to 33&#8197;g/L p&#8208;coumaric acid within 24&#8197;hours, a 1.9&#8208;fold improvement compared to biocatalysis without in&#8197;situ product removal.

         <title>Sequence&#8208;Guided Redesign of an Omega&#8208;Transaminase from Bacillus megaterium for the Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#969;&#8208;TA from Bacillus megaterium (BmeTA) is selected for engineering to catalyze the synthesis of (S)&#8208;methoxyisopropylamine from methoxyacetone. An engineered &#969;&#8208;TA (2M) with improvement of solubility, activity and thermostability is obtained through multiple sequence alignment. Furthermore, Molecule Dynamics simulation explains the mechanisms of its improved properties. 2M is also found to be more advantageous in catalyzing various ketones.







Abstract
&#969;&#8208;Transaminases (&#969;&#8208;TAs) are attractive biocatalysts asymmetrically catalyzing ketones to chiral amines. However, poor non&#8208;native catalytic activity and substrate promiscuity severely hamper its wide application in industrial production. Protein engineering efforts have generally focused on reshaping the substrate&#8208;binding pockets of &#969;&#8208;TAs. However, hotspots around the substrate tunnel as well as distant sites outside the pockets may also affect its activity. In this study, the &#969;&#8208;TA from Bacillus megaterium (BmeTA) was selected for engineering. The tunnel mutation Y164F synergy with distant mutation A245T which was acquired through a multiple sequence alignment showed improved soluble expression, a 3.7&#8208;fold higher specific activity and a 19.9&#8208;fold longer half&#8208;life at 45&#8201;&#176;C. Molecule Dynamics simulation explains the mechanism of improved catalytic activity, enhanced thermostability and improved soluble expression of BmeTAY164F/A245T(2&#8197;M). Finally, the resting cells of 2&#8197;M were used for biocatalytic processes. 450&#8197;mM of S&#8208;methoxyisopropylamine (S&#8208;MOIPA) was obtained with an ee value of 97.3&#8201;% and a conversion rate of 90&#8201;%, laying the foundation for its industrial production. Mutant 2&#8197;M was also found to be more advantageous in catalyzing the transamination of various ketones. These results demonstrated that sites that are far away from the active center also play an important role in the redesign of &#969;&#8208;TAs.

         <title>A Highly Sensitive and Selective Fluorescent Sensor for Folic Acid Detection Based on D&#8208;penicillamine Stabilized Ag/Cu Alloy Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a sensor was developed for detecting folic acid (FA) using D&#8208;penicillamine stabilized Ag/Cu alloy nanoclusters (DPA@Ag/Cu NCs). Experimental results demonstrated a linear relationship between FA concentrations and fluorescence quenching of DPA@Ag/Cu NCs, with a low detection limit of 5.3&#8197;nM, based on the fluorescence quenching mechanism caused by electron transfer. Moreover, this approach was successfully applied to FA in complex biological samples.







Abstract
In this work, a highly sensitive and selective method for detecting folic acid (FA) was developed using D&#8208;penicillamine (DPA) stabilized Ag/Cu alloy nanoclusters (DPA@Ag/Cu NCs). The yellow emission of DPA@Ag/Cu NCs was found to be quenched upon the addition of FA to the system. The fluorescence intensity quenching value demonstrated a linear relationship with FA concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 1200&#8197;&#956;M, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 5.3&#8197;nM. Furthermore, the detection mechanism was investigated through various characterization analyses, including high resolution transmission electron microscopy, fluorescence spectra, ultraviolet&#8208;visible absorption spectra, and fluorescence lifetime. The results indicated that the fluorescence quenching induced by FA was a result of electron transfer from FA to the ligands of DPA@Ag/Cu NCs. The selectivity of the FA sensor was also evaluated, showing that common amino acids and inorganic ions had minimal impact on the detection of FA. Moreover, the standard addition method was successfully applied to detect FA in human serum, chewable tablets and FA tablets with promising results. The use of DPA@Ag/Cu NCs demonstrates significant potential for detecting FA in complex biological samples.

         <title>Transport of Zinc&#8208;Phthalocyanine to Cancer Cells using Myoglobin&#8208;Albumin Fusion Protein for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a noninvasive approach to cancer treatment, wherein cell death is initiated by singlet oxygen (1O2) production via energy transfer from excited photosensitizers to ground&#8208;state O2. Effective clinical photosensitizers necessitate water solubility for in vivo administration. Hydrophobic dyes, such as phthalocyanines, cannot be used directly as photosensitizers. Herein, we synthesized a myoglobin&#8208;(human serum albumin) fusion protein reconstituted with zinc&#8208;phthalocyanine (ZnPc), termed ZnPcMb&#8208;HSA. The photophysical properties of ZnPcMb&#8208;HSA closely resemble those of ZnPc&#8208;substituted Mb. Notably, ZnPc dissociates from ZnPcMb&#8208;HSA and selectively accumulates within cancer cells, while the protein components remain extracellular. Treatment of four distinct cell lines with ZnPcMb&#8208;HSA, followed by red&#8208;light irradiation, effectively induced apoptosis. The half&#8208;maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) against these cancer cell lines ranged between 0.1&#8211;0.5 &#956;M. Reconstituted Mb&#8208;HSA emerges as a promising carrier for transporting various water&#8208;insoluble porphyrinoid photosensitizer to target cancer cells in PDT applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Monomer&#8208;Dimer Equilibrium of Human Cystatin C During Internalization Into Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The experimental pathway followed within the manuscript. Human cystatin C (hCC) was labeled with sulfo&#8208;Cyanine 5.5 NHS ester (Cy5.5) and incubated with HeLa cells. The internalization of hCC in the cells was monitored with confocal microscopy to understand the influence of the oligomeric state of hCC on the cell membrane&#8208;protein interaction.







Abstract
Human cystatin C (hCC) is a physiologically important protein that serves as intra&#8208; and extracellular cysteine proteinase inhibitor in homeostasis. However, in pathological states it dimerizes and further oligomerizes accumulating into a toxic amyloid. HCC forms an active monomer in the extracellular space and becomes an inactive dimer when internalized in cellular organelles. However, hCC cell penetration and its oligomeric state during this process are not well understood. To determine if and how the oligomeric state influences hCC transmembrane migration, we investigated the internalization of the hCC wild type protein as well as three different mutants, which exclusively exist in the monomeric or multimeric state into HeLa cells via confocal fluorescence microscopy. Our results showed that the preferred pathway was endocytosis and that the oligomeric state did not significantly influence the internalization because both monomeric and dimeric hCC migrated into HeLa cells. Considering the differences of the active monomeric and the passive dimeric states of hCC, our findings contribute to a better understanding of the intra and extra cellular functions of hCC and their interaction with cysteine proteases.

&lt;p&gt;The experimental pathway followed within the manuscript. Human cystatin C (hCC) was labeled with sulfo-Cyanine 5.5 NHS ester (Cy5.5) and incubated with HeLa cells. The internalization of hCC in the cells was monitored with confocal microscopy to understand the influence of the oligomeric state of hCC on the cell membrane-protein interaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human cystatin C (hCC) is a physiologically important protein that serves as intra- and extracellular cysteine proteinase inhibitor in homeostasis. However, in pathological states it dimerizes and further oligomerizes accumulating into a toxic amyloid. HCC forms an active monomer in the extracellular space and becomes an inactive dimer when internalized in cellular organelles. However, hCC cell penetration and its oligomeric state during this process are not well understood. To determine if and how the oligomeric state influences hCC transmembrane migration, we investigated the internalization of the hCC wild type protein as well as three different mutants, which exclusively exist in the monomeric or multimeric state into HeLa cells via confocal fluorescence microscopy. Our results showed that the preferred pathway was endocytosis and that the oligomeric state did not significantly influence the internalization because both monomeric and dimeric hCC migrated into HeLa cells. Considering the differences of the active monomeric and the passive dimeric states of hCC, our findings contribute to a better understanding of the intra and extra cellular functions of hCC and their interaction with cysteine proteases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering of a Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenase to Improve Substrate Scope, Stereoselectivity and Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a loop swapping strategy was applied to Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenase catalytic pocket, which demonstrated effect in tuning substrate acceptance for cyclohexanone and cyclobutanone derivatives, followed by loop optimization further regulated the stereoselectivity and regioselectivity. X&#8208;ray crystal structures of superior mutants exhibits dynamics in the catalytic pocket and molecular dynamics (MD) computations reveal reshaped hydrogen bond interaction networks and active substrate conformations.







Abstract
Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenases belong to a family of flavin&#8208;binding proteins that catalyze the Baeyer&#8208;Villiger (BV) oxidation of ketones to produce lactones or esters, which are important intermediates in pharmaceuticals or sustainable materials. Phenylacetone monooxygenase (PAMO) from Thermobifida fusca with moderate thermostability catalyzes the oxidation of aryl ketone substrates, but is limited by high specificity and narrow substrate scope. In the present study, we applied loop optimization by loop swapping followed by focused saturation mutagenesis in order to evolve PAMO mutants capable of catalyzing the regioselective BV oxidation of cyclohexanone and cyclobutanone derivatives with formation of either normal or abnormal esters or lactones. We further modulated PAMO to increase enantioselectivity. Crystal structure studies indicate that rotation occurs in the NADP&#8208;binding domain and that the high B&#8208;factor region is predominantly distributed in the catalytic pocket residues. Computational analyses further revealed dynamic character in the catalytic pocket and reshaped hydrogen bond interaction networks, which is more favorable for substrate binding. Our study provides useful insights for studying enzyme&#8208;substrate adaptations.

         <title>Impact of Protein Corona Formation and Polystyrene Nanoparticle Functionalisation on the Interaction with Dynamic Biomimetic Membranes Comprising of Integrin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This investigation explores the interplay between different functionalised polystyrene nanoparticles and the formation of their protein corona in CCM. Subsequently, we analyse the contact interface of both bare and protein&#8208;conjugated PS&#8208;NPs with platelet&#8208;mimetic membranes that incorporate integrin &#945;IIb&#946;3, undergoing conformational dynamics. The application of quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) with dissipation monitoring provides real&#8208;time nanoscale precision to assess the concentration&#8208;dependent cytotoxic effects of PS&#8208;NPs.







Abstract
Plastics, omnipresent in the environment, have become a global concern due to their durability and limited biodegradability, especially in the form of microparticles and nanoparticles. Polystyrene (PS), a key plastic type, is susceptible to fragmentation and surface alterations induced by environmental factors or industrial processes. With widespread human exposure through pollution and diverse industrial applications, understanding the physiological impact of PS, particularly in nanoparticle form (PS&#8208;NPs), is crucial. This study focuses on the interaction of PS&#8208;NPs with model blood proteins, emphasising the formation of a protein corona, and explores the subsequent contact with platelet membrane mimetics using experimental and theoretical approaches. The investigation involves &#945;IIb&#946;3&#8208;expressing cells and biomimetic membranes, enabling real&#8208;time and label&#8208;free nanoscale precision. By employing quartz&#8208;crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring studies, the concentration&#8208;dependent cytotoxic effects of differently functionalised ~210&#8197;nm PS&#8208;NPs on HEK293 cells overexpressing &#945;IIb&#946;3 are evaluated in detail. The study unveils insights into the molecular details of PS&#8208;NP interaction with supported lipid bilayers, demonstrating that a protein corona formed in the presence of exemplary blood proteins offers protection against membrane damage, mitigating PS&#8208;NP cytotoxicity.

         <title>Chemical Production of Cytotoxic Bispecific Antibodies Using the Ugi Multicomponent Reaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the chemical synthesis of bispecific antibodies using two site&#8208;selective conjugation reactions. Seven constructs with 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 valency were produced, including two cytotoxic T&#8208;cell engagers with IC50 values in the picomolar range in&#8197;vitro.







Abstract
Bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) have recently emerged as a promising platform for the treatment of several conditions, most importantly cancer. Based on the combination of two different antigen&#8208;binding motifs in a single macromolecule; bsAbs can either display the combined characteristics of their parent antibodies, or new therapeutic features, inaccessible by the sole combination of two distinct antibodies. While bsAbs are traditionally produced by molecular biology techniques, the chemical development of bsAbs holds great promises and strategies have just begun to surface. In this context, we took advantage of a chemical strategy based on the use of the Ugi reaction for the site&#8208;selective conjugation of whole antibodies and coupled the resulting conjugates in a bioorthogonal manner with Fab fragments, derived from various antibodies. We thus managed to produce five different bsAbs with 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 valency, with yields ranging from 20&#8201;% to 48&#8201;%, and showed that the affinity of the parent antibody was preserved in all bsAbs. We further demonstrated the interest of our strategy by producing two other bsAbs behaving as cytotoxic T cell engagers with IC50 values in the picomolar range in&#8197;vitro.

         <title>Allosteric effects of EF&#8208;G domain I mutations inducing ribosome frameshifting revealed by multiplexed force spectroscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ribosome translocation catalyzed by elongation factor G (EF&#8208;G) is a critical step in protein synthesis where the ribosome typically moves along the mRNA by three nucleotides at each step. To investigate the mechanism of EF&#8208;G catalysis, it is essential to precisely resolve the ribosome motion at both ends of the mRNA, which, to our best knowledge, is only achieved with the magnetic&#8208;based force spectroscopy developed by our groups. Here, we introduce a novel multiplexed force spectroscopy technique that, for the first time, offers single&#8208;nucleotide resolution for multiple samples. This technique combines multiple acoustic force generators with the smallest atomic magnetometer designed for biological research. Utilizing this technique, we demonstrate that mutating EF&#8208;G at the GTP binding pocket results in the ribosome moving only two nucleotides on both ends of the mRNA, thereby compromising ribosome translocation. This finding suggests a direct link between GTP hydrolysis and ribosome translocation. Our results not only provide mechanistic insights into the role of GTP binding pocket but also illuminate how allosteric mutations can manipulate translocation. We anticipate broader applications of our technique in the ribosome field, leveraging its high efficiency and single&#8208;nucleotide resolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthesis and Assembly Logic of Fungal Hybrid Terpenoid Natural Products</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent decades, fungi have emerged as significant sources of diverse hybrid terpenoid natural products,&#160;and&#160;their biosynthetic pathways are increasingly unveiled. This review mainly focuses on elucidating the various strategies underlying the biosynthesis and assembly logic of these compounds. These pathways combine terpenoid moieties with diverse building blocks including polyketides, nonribosomal peptides, amino acids, p&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid, saccharides, and adenine, resulting in the formation of plenty of hybrid terpenoid natural products via C&#8211;O, C&#8211;C, or C&#8211;N bond linkages. Subsequent tailoring steps, such as oxidation, cyclization, and rearrangement, further enhance the biological diversity and structural complexity of these hybrid terpenoid natural products. Understanding these biosynthetic mechanisms holds promise for the discovery of novel hybrid terpenoid natural products from fungi, which will promote the development of potential drug candidates in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;mediated antibiotic delivery to in vivo biofilm infections: A Review</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial biofilms are a significant concern in various medical contexts due to their resilience to our immune system as well as antibiotic therapy. Biofilms often require surgical removal and frequently lead to recurrent or chronic infections. Therefore, there is an urgent need for improved strategies to treat biofilm infections. Ultrasound&#8208;mediated drug delivery is a technique that combines ultrasound application, often with the administration of acoustically&#8208;active agents, to enhance drug delivery to specific target tissues or cells within the body. This method involves using ultrasound waves to assist in the transportation or activation of medications, improving their penetration, distribution, and efficacy at the desired site. The advantages of ultrasound&#8208;mediated drug delivery include targeted and localized delivery, reduced systemic side effects, and improved efficacy of the drug at lower doses. This review scrutinizes recent advances in the application of ultrasound&#8208;mediated drug delivery for treating biofilm infections, focusing on in vivo studies. We examine the strengths and limitations of this technology in the context of wound infections, device&#8208;associated infections, lung infections and abscesses, and discuss current gaps in knowledge and clinical translation considerations.</dc:description>

         <title>(S)&#8208;ML&#8208;SA1 ACTIVATES AUTOPHAGY VIA TRPML1&#8208;TFEB PATHWAY</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Autophagic flux plays a crucial role in various diseases. Recently, the lysosomal ion channel TRPML1 has emerged as a promising target in lysosomal storage diseases, such as mucolipidosis. The discovery of mucolipin synthetic agonist&#8208;1 (ML&#8208;SA1) has expanded our understanding of TRPML1's function and its potential therapeutic uses. However, ML&#8208;SA1 is a racemate with limited cellular potency and poor water solubility. In this study, we synthetized rac&#8208;ML&#8208;SA1, separated the enantiomers by chiral liquid chromatography and determined their absolute configuration by vibrational circular dichroism (VCD). In addition, we focused on investigating the impact of each enantiomer of ML&#8208;SA1 on the TRPML1&#8208;TFEB axis. Our findings revealed that (S)&#8208;ML&#8208;SA1 acts as an agonist for TRPML1 at the lysosomal membrane. This activation prompts transcription factor EB (TFEB) to translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus in a dose&#8208;dependent manner within live cells. Consequently, this signaling pathway enhances the expression of coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation (CLEAR) genes and activates autophagic flux. Our study presents evidence for the potential use of (S)&#8208;ML&#8208;SA1 in the development of new therapies for lysosomal storage diseases that target TRPML1.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Supramolecular hydrogels can be obtained via self&#8208;assembly of small molecules in aqueous environments. In this study, we describe the development of oxidation&#8208;responsive supramolecular hydrogels comprising glucosamine derivatives with an aryl sulfide group. We demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide can induce a gel&#8211;sol transition through the oxidation of the sulfide group to the corresponding sulfoxide. Furthermore, we show that this oxidation responsiveness can be extended to photo&#8208;responsiveness with the aid of a photosensitizer.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bispecific Chimeric Aptamer Design Platform Based on c&#8208;MET Aptamer with a Replaceable Redundant Region</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular engineering enables the creation of aptamers with novel functions, but the prerequisite is a deep understanding of their structure and recognition mechanism. The cellular&#8208;mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (c&#8208;MET) is garnering significant attention due to the critical role of the c&#8208;MET/HGF signaling pathway in tumor development and invasion. This study reports a strategy for constructing novel chimeric aptamers that bind to both c&#8208;MET and other specific proteins. c&#8208;MET was identified to be the molecular target of a DNA aptamer, HF3&#8208;58, selected through cell&#8208;SELEX. The binding structure and mechanism of HF3&#8208;58 with c&#8208;MET were systematically studied, revealing the scaffold, recognition, and redundancy regions. Through molecular engineering design, the redundancy region was replaced with other aptamers possessing stem&#8208;loop structures, yielding novel chimeric aptamers with bispecificity for binding to c&#8208;MET and specific proteins. A chimeric bispecific aptamer HF&#8208;3b showed the ability to mediate the adhesion of T&#8208;cells to tumor cells, suggesting the prospective utility in tumor immunotherapy. These findings suggest that aptamer HF3&#8208;58 can serve as a molecular engineering platform for the development of diverse multifunctional ligands targeting c&#8208;MET. Moreover, comprehensive understanding of the binding mechanisms of aptamers will provide guidance for the design of functional aptamers, significantly expanding their potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoproteomic strategy identifies PfUCHL3 as the target of halofuginone</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) continues to pose a significant public health challenge, leading to millions of fatalities globally. Halofuginone (HF) has shown a significant anti&#8208;P. falciparum effect, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for malaria treatment. In this study, we synthesized a photoaffinity labeling probe of HF to identify its direct target in P. falciparum. Our results reveal that ubiquitin carboxyl&#8208;terminal hydrolase 3 (PfUCHL3) acts as a crucial target protein of HF, which modulates parasite growth in the intraerythrocytic cycle. In particular, we discovered that HF potentially forms hydrogen bonds with the Leu10, Glu11, and Arg217 sites of PfUCHL3, thereby inducing an allosteric effect by promoting the embedding of the helix 6&#8217; region on the protein surface. Furthermore, HF disrupts the expression of multiple functional proteins mediated by PfUCHL3, specifically those that play crucial roles in amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism in P. falciparum. Taken together, this study highlights PfUCHL3 as a previously undisclosed druggable target of HF, which contributes to the development of novel anti&#8208;malarial agents in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of smartphone&#8208;integrated nanozyme sensor based on amino acid&#8208;modulated gold nanoparticles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino acids are not only the building blocks of proteins but also lead to the development of novel nanomaterials with unique properties. Herein, we proposed a simple strategy to produce gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) with peroxidase&#8208;like (POD&#8208;like) activities by using a series of amino acids as reducing agents, named Au NPs@M (M represents different amino acids). The Au NPs@His was identified as the nanozyme with the most potent catalytic performance, which was used in combination with smartphones to achieve rapid detection of hydrogen peroxide with a detection limit of 0.966 &#956;M. It also enables rapid detection of glucose with a detection limit of 2.904 &#956;M, highlighting the significant contribution of Au NPs@His in expediting the detection of critical biomolecules. This work not only provides a convenient and highly efficient method to identify glucose but also shows the potential of histidine as a reducing agent in constructing Au nanomaterials exerting enzyme&#8208;like catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>14&#8208;3&#8208;3 Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions: From Mechanistic Understanding to Their Small&#8208;Molecule Stabilization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular glues that stabilize the interaction of the phosphorylation reader protein 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 with individual client proteins present a huge opportunity for therapeutic intervention in a wide array of human diseases. Among the vast array of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 clients are disease&#8208;related proteins like LRRK2, Tau, p53, C&#8208;Raf, CFTR, Pyrin, PLN, and ChREBP, where a 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 molecular glue promises a therapeutic benefit for patients.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) are of utmost importance for maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Herein, a central role can be found for 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 proteins. These hub&#8208;proteins are known to bind hundreds of interaction partners, thereby regulating their activity, localization, and/or stabilization. Due to their ability to bind a large variety of client proteins, studies of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 protein complexes flourished over the last decades, aiming to gain greater molecular understanding of these complexes and their role in health and disease. Because of their crucial role within the cell, 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 protein complexes are recognized as highly interesting therapeutic targets, encouraging the discovery of small molecule modulators of these PPIs. We discuss various examples of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;mediated regulation of its binding partners on a mechanistic level, highlighting the versatile and multi&#8208;functional role of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 within the cell. Furthermore, an overview is given on the development of stabilizers of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 protein complexes, from initially used natural products to fragment&#8208;based approaches. These studies show the potential of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 PPI stabilizers as novel agents in drug discovery and as tool compounds to gain greater molecular understanding of the role of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;based protein regulation.

         <title>In vivo Labeling and Intravital Imaging of Bacterial Infection using a Near&#8208;infrared Fluorescent D&#8208;Amino Acid Probe</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new near&#8208;infrared fluorescent D&#8208;amino acid probe, Cy7ADA, is reported. It effectively labels Staphylococcus aureus in mice liver, enabling intravital confocal imaging of biodistributions of the bacterial pathogen. Cy7ADA's labeling also presents the pathogens&#8217; responses to antibiotics, and facilitates 3D in&#8197;situ imaging in tissue&#8208;cleared liver samples, holding great potential in studying bacterial infections in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Bacterial infections still pose a severe threat to public health, necessitating novel tools for real&#8208;time analysis of microbial behaviors in living organisms. While genetically engineered strains with fluorescent or luminescent reporters are commonly used in tracking bacteria, their in&#8197;vivo uses are often limited. Here, we report a near&#8208;infrared fluorescent D&#8208;amino acid (FDAA) probe, Cy7ADA, for in&#8197;situ labeling and intravital imaging of bacterial infections in mice. Cy7ADA probe effectively labels various bacteria in&#8197;vitro and pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus in mice after intraperitoneal injection. Because of Cy7&#8217;s high tissue penetration and the quick excretion of free probes via urine, real&#8208;time visualization of the pathogens in a liver abscess model via intravital confocal microscopy is achieved. The biodistributions, including their intracellular localization within Kupffer cells, are revealed. Monitoring bacterial responses to antibiotics also demonstrates Cy7ADA&#8242;s capability to reflect the bacterial load dynamics within the host. Furthermore, Cy7ADA facilitates three&#8208;dimensional pathogen imaging in tissue&#8208;cleared liver samples, showcasing its potential for studying the biogeography of microbes in different organs. Integrating near&#8208;infrared FDAA probes with intravital microscopy holds promise for wide applications in studying bacterial infections in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>Bora&#8208;Diaza&#8208;Indacene Based Fluorescent Probes for Simultaneous Visualisation of Lipid Droplets and Endoplasmic Reticulum</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organelle selective fluorescent probes, capable of concurrently detecting specific organelles, help delineate the interplay between various organelles and the impact of such interaction in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its disruption in the diseased state. This work details the synthesis, photophysical properties, and cellular imaging studies of two bora&#8208;diaza&#8208;indacene based fluorescent probes that can simultaneously visualise lipid droplets and endoplasmic reticulum.







Abstract
Organelle selective fluorescent probes, especially those capable of concurrent detection of specific organelles, are of benefit to the research community in delineating the interplay between various organelles and the impact of such interaction in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its disruption in the diseased state. Although very useful, such probes are synthetically challenging to design due to the stringent lipophilicity requirement posed by different organelles, and hence, the lack of such probes being reported so far. This work details the synthesis, photophysical properties, and cellular imaging studies of two bora&#8208;diaza&#8208;indacene based fluorescent probes that can specifically and simultaneously visualise lipid droplets and endoplasmic reticulum; two organelles suggested having close interactions and implicated in stress&#8208;induced cellular dysfunction and disease progression.

         <title>Chemical and Enzyme&#8208;Mediated Chemical Reactions for Studying Nucleic Acids and Their Modifications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical tools are highly necessary to study the diverse structures, intricate functions, and complex interactions of nucleic acids, further laying the foundation for investigating their biological and physiological roles within multiple contexts. This work reviews the recent advances of chemical and enzyme&#8208;mediated chemical reactions applied to nucleobases, naturally occurring base modification variants, and ribose ring.







Abstract
Nucleic acids are genetic information&#8208;carrying molecules inside cells. Apart from basic nucleotide building blocks, there exist various naturally occurring chemical modifications on nucleobase and ribose moieties, which greatly increase the encoding complexity of nuclei acids, contribute to the alteration of nucleic acid structures, and play versatile regulation roles in gene expression. To study the functions of certain nucleic acids in various biological contexts, robust tools to specifically label and identify these macromolecules and their modifications, and to illuminate their structures are highly necessary. In this review, we summarize recent technique advances of using chemical and enzyme&#8208;mediated chemical reactions to study nucleic acids and their modifications and structures. By highlighting the chemical principles of these techniques, we aim to present a perspective on the advancement of the field as well as to offer insights into developing specific chemical reactions and precise enzyme catalysis utilized for nucleic acids and their modifications.

         <title>Fluorinated Tags to Study Protein Conformation and Interactions Using 19F&#8201;NMR</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8216;Tagging&#8217; proteins with fluorinated groups provides a tool to observe protein behavior at the atomic level using 19F&#8197;NMR. This background&#8208;free, environmentally&#8208;sensitive method allows researchers to study protein conformation, folding, aggregation and ligand/drug binding. Chemical tagging also allows the use of a much larger pool of fluorinated reporters with tunable chemical shifts and sensitivities compared to biosynthetic methods.







Abstract
The incorporation of fluorine atoms into a biomacromolecule provides a background&#8208;free and environmentally sensitive reporter of structure, conformation and interactions using 19F&#8197;NMR. There are several methods to introduce the 19F reporter &#8211; either by synthetic incorporation via solid phase peptide synthesis; by suppressing the incorporation or biosynthesis of a natural amino acid and supplementing the growth media with a fluorinated counterpart during protein expression; and by genetic code expansion to add new amino acids to the amino acid alphabet. This review aims to discuss progress in the field of introducing fluorinated handles into biomolecules for NMR studies by post&#8208;translational bioconjugation or &#8216;fluorine&#8208;tagging&#8217;. We will discuss the range of chemical tagging &#8216;warheads&#8217; that have been used, explore the applications of fluorine tags, discuss ways to enhance reporter sensitivity and how the signal to noise ratios can be boosted. Finally, we consider some key challenges of the field and offer some ideas for future directions.

&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Tagging&#8217; proteins with fluorinated groups provides a tool to observe protein behavior at the atomic level using &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F&#8197;NMR. This background-free, environmentally-sensitive method allows researchers to study protein conformation, folding, aggregation and ligand/drug binding. Chemical tagging also allows the use of a much larger pool of fluorinated reporters with tunable chemical shifts and sensitivities compared to biosynthetic methods.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incorporation of fluorine atoms into a biomacromolecule provides a background-free and environmentally sensitive reporter of structure, conformation and interactions using &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F&#8197;NMR. There are several methods to introduce the &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F reporter &#8211; either by synthetic incorporation &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; solid phase peptide synthesis; by suppressing the incorporation or biosynthesis of a natural amino acid and supplementing the growth media with a fluorinated counterpart during protein expression; and by genetic code expansion to add new amino acids to the amino acid alphabet. This review aims to discuss progress in the field of introducing fluorinated handles into biomolecules for NMR studies by post-translational bioconjugation or &#8216;fluorine-tagging&#8217;. We will discuss the range of chemical tagging &#8216;warheads&#8217; that have been used, explore the applications of fluorine tags, discuss ways to enhance reporter sensitivity and how the signal to noise ratios can be boosted. Finally, we consider some key challenges of the field and offer some ideas for future directions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Prussian Blue&#8208;Assisted NIR Triggered in&#8208;Situ Polymerized Nanocomposite Hydrogel for Wound Repair</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogels are commonly used as wound dressings to help maintain a moist environment around the wound and isolate contaminants, thus promoting healing. For irregular wounds, the slow healing process and even infection may occur due to the inability of dressings to adhere well to the wound.&#160;Prussian blue (PB)&#160;is a metal&#8208;organic framework&#160;(MOF)&#160;material with excellent photothermal conversion and superior stability. In this paper, a kind of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#160;light triggered in&#8208;situ&#160;polymerized antimicrobial hydrogel was prepared. The free radical initiator was&#160;encapsulated in the hollow PB by a phase change material&#160;(PCM)&#160;to maintain stability.
The&#160;raised temperature triggered by NIR&#160;induced the release and decomposition of the initiator. The matrix was formed by the cross&#8208;linking of double bonds on modified chitosan. The quaternary amine groups of modified chitosan and the photothermal properties of PB enhanced the antimicrobial properties of the hydrogel. High&#8208;quality wound healing was demonstrated in the whole skin defect model. This study provides a new reference for the preparation of in&#8208;situ&#160;polymerized hydrogel dressings for irregular wounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Substitution Effects on Subcellular Organelle Localization in Live&#8208;cell Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of D&#8208;p&#8208;A indole&#8208;containing fluorescent probes were developed followed by an investigation of their photophysical properties and compounds' suitability for subcellular imaging in living cells. We demonstrate that the preference for mitochondrial localization was lost when morpholine was substituted, resulting in the accumulation of the molecule in the lysosomes. However, interestingly, the presence of a nitro group led to their localization within the lipid droplets despite the presence of the morpholine pendant. We also showcase the probes' sensitivity to pH, the influence of added chloroquine, and the temperature response on the changes in fluorescence intensity within lysosomes. The design of the probes with strong intramolecular charge transfer and substantial Stokes shift could facilitate extensive application in various cellular lysosomal models and contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in stimuli&#8208;responsive diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Uracil&#8208;selective Cross&#8208;linking in RNA and Inhibition of miRNA Function by 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;6&#8208;vinyl&#8208;7&#8208;deazapurine Deoxynucleosides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression through RNA interference. Consequently, miRNA inhibitors, such as anti&#8208;miRNA oligonucleotides (AMOs), have attracted attention for treating miRNA overexpression. To achieve efficient inhibition, we developed 2&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;vinylpurine (AVP) nucleosides that form covalent bonds with uridine counterparts in RNA. We demonstrated that mRNA cross&#8208;linked with AVP&#8208;conjugated antisense oligonucleotides with AVP were protected from gene silencing by exogenous miRNA. However, endogenous miRNA function could not be inhibited in cells, probably because of slow cross&#8208;linking kinetics. We recently developed ADpVP, an AVP derivative bearing a 7&#8208;propynyl group&#8212;which boasts faster reaction rate than the original AVP. Here, we synthesized dADpVP&#8212;a deoxy analog of ADpVP&#8212;through a simplified synthesis protocol. Evaluation of the cross&#8208;linking reaction revealed that the reaction kinetics of dADpVP were comparable to those of ADpVP. In addition, structural analysis of the cross&#8208;linked adduct discovered N3 linkage against uridine. Incorporating dADpVP into two types of miRNA inhibitors revealed a marginal impact on AMO efficacy yet improved the performance of target site blockers. These results indicate the potential of cross&#8208;linking nucleosides for indirect miRNA function inhibition.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Peptidoglycan Synthesis in the Gut Commensal Akkermansia Muciniphila with Bioorthogonal Chemical Reporters</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We here present cyclopropene and isonitrile functionalized analogs of d&#8208;Ala dipeptides, essential for peptidoglycan biosynthesis, as new members of the bacterial metabolic labeling toolkit. These non&#8208;toxic, tetrazine click&#8208;compatible probes allowed us to detect and image peptidoglycan in live Akkermansia muciniphila bacteria. Their effectiveness in this anaerobic bacterium and also aerobic bacteria (E. coli) shows their potential for in&#8197;situ study of peptidoglycan.







Abstract
Our gut microbiota directly influences human physiology in health and disease. The myriad of surface glycoconjugates in both the bacterial cell envelope and our gut cells dominate the microbiota&#8208;host interface and play a critical role in host response and microbiota homeostasis. Among these, peptidoglycan is the basic glycan polymer offering the cell rigidity and a basis on which many other glycoconjugates are anchored. To directly study peptidoglycan in gut commensals and obtain the molecular insight required to understand their functional activities we need effective techniques like chemical probes to label peptidoglycan in live bacteria. Here we report a chemically guided approach to study peptidoglycan in a key mucin&#8208;degrading gut microbiota member of the Verrucomicrobia phylum, Akkermansia muciniphila. Two novel non&#8208;toxic tetrazine click&#8208;compatible peptidoglycan probes with either a cyclopropene or isonitrile handle allowed for the detection and imaging of peptidoglycan synthesis in this intestinal species.

         <title>Allosteric Regulation and Inhibition of Coronavirus 3CLpro Revealed by HDX&#8208;MS</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The viruses invade the host and produce mature 3CLpro dimers, which are depolymerized into inactive monomeric forms by the allosteric inhibitor Gastrodenol.







Abstract
Coronavirus (CoV) infections have caused contagious and fatal respiratory diseases in humans worldwide. CoV 3&#8208;chymotrypsin&#8208;like proteases (3CLpro or Mpro) play an important role in viral maturation, and maintenance of their dimeric conformation is crucial for viral activity. Therefore, allosterically regulated dimerization of 3CLpro can be employed as a drug development target. Here, we investigated the allosteric regulatory mechanism of 3CLpro dimerization by using hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry (HDX&#8208;MS) technology. We found that the FLAG tag directly coupled to the N&#8208;finger of 3CLpro significantly increased HDX kinetics at the dimer interface, and 3CLpro transformed from a dimer to a monomer. The 3CLpro mutants of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, which are monomeric, also exhibited increased deuterium exchange. Binding of the allosteric inhibitor Gastrodenol to most betacoronavirus 3CLpros led to increased allosteric deuterium exchange, resulting in the monomeric conformation of the CoV 3CLpro upon binding. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis further indicated the molecular mechanism of action of Gastrodenol on CoV 3CLpro: binding of Gastrodenol to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 3CLpro destroyed the hydrogen bond in the dimer interface. These results suggest that Gastrodenol may be a potential broad&#8208;spectrum anti&#8208;betacoronavirus drug.

         <title>Quality Control of mRNA Vaccines by Synthetic Ribonucleases: Analysis of the Poly&#8208;A&#8208;Tail</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligonucleotide conjugates of tris(2&#8208;aminobenzimidazoles) are known as potent and sequence&#8208;specific RNA cleavers. Here we apply such &#8220;chemical scissors&#8221; as analytical tools to evaluate critical quality attributes of mRNA vaccines, like the poly&#8208;A tail or the 5&#8217; terminus. To assure continuous access to tris(2&#8208;aminobenzimidazole) conjugates, an optimized synthetic procedure using microwave irradiation has been developed.







Abstract
The effectivity and safety of mRNA vaccines critically depends on the presence of correct 5&#8217; caps and poly&#8208;A tails. Due to the high molecular mass of full&#8208;size mRNAs, however, the direct analysis by mass spectrometry is hardly possible. Here we describe the use of synthetic ribonucleases to cleave off 5&#8217; and 3&#8217; terminal fragments which can be further analyzed by HPLC or by LC&#8211;MS. Compared to existing methods (e.&#8201;g. RNase H), the new approach uses robust catalysts, is free of sequence limitations, avoids metal ions and combines fast sample preparation with high precision of the cut.

         <dc:description>
Cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) STING agonists are potential cancer immunotherapy agents. The majority of CDN analogs being evaluated in the clinic contain the phosphorothioate moiety. This work demonstrates that the underexplored 5&#8217;&#8208;S&#8208;phosphorothioester containing CDNs, referred to as endo&#8208;S&#8208;CDN, are potent STING agonists. LNA functionalized endo&#8208;S&#8208;CDN is shown to be more resistant to oxidative degradation than ADU&#8208;S100, a CDN analog containing a phosphorothioate bioisostere.







Abstract
Cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) have garnered popularity over the last decade as immunotherapeutic agents, which activate the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway to trigger an immune response. Many analogs of 2&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cGAMP, c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP, and c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP have been developed and shown as effective cancer vaccines and immunomodulators for the induction of both the adaptive and innate immune systems. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of these CDNs is limited by their chemical and enzymatic instability. We recently introduced 5&#8217;&#8208;endo&#8208;phosphorothoiate 2&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cGAMP analogs as potent STING agonist with improved resistance to cleavage by clinically relevant phosphodiesterases. We herein report the synthesis of locked nucleic acid&#8208;functionalized (LNA) endo&#8208;S&#8208;CDNs and evaluate their ability to activate STING in THP1 monocytes. Interestingly, some of our synthesized LNA 3&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;endo&#8208;S&#8208;CDNs can moderately activate hSTING REF haplotype (R232H), which exhibit diminished response to both 2&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cGAMP and ADU&#8208;S100. Also, we show that one of our most potent endo&#8208;S&#8208;CDNs has remarkable chemical (oxidants I2 and H2O2) and phosphodiesterase stability.

         <title>Matching Together Living Cells and Prototissues: Will There Be Chemistry?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Scientific advancements in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology have led to the development of numerous models of synthetic cells, or protocells. To date, research has mainly focused on increasing the (bio)chemical complexity of these bioinspired micro&#8208;compartmentalized systems, yet the successful integration of protocells with living cells remains one of the major challenges in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. In this review, we aim to summarize the current state of the art in hybrid protocell/living cell and prototissue/living cell systems. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in tissue engineering, we review the chemical, bio&#8208;chemical, and mechano&#8208;chemical aspects that hold promise for achieving an effective integration of non&#8208;living and living matter. The future production of fully integrated protocell/living cell systems and increasingly complex prototissue/living tissue systems not only has the potential to revolutionize the field of tissue engineering, but also paves the way for new technologies in (bio)sensing, personalized therapy, and drug delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Point Mutation Abolishes Water Capture in Germacradien&#8208;4&#8208;ol Synthase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high&#8208;fidelity sesquiterpene cyclase (&#8208;)&#8208;germacradien&#8208;4&#8208;ol synthase (GdolS) converts farnesyl diphosphate into the macrocyclic alcohol (&#8208;)&#8208;germacradien&#8208;4&#8208;ol. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis was used to decipher the role of key residues in the water control mechanism. Replacement of Ala176, located in the G1/2 helix, with non&#8208;polar aliphatic residues of increasing size (valine, leucine, isoleucine and methionine) resulted in the accumulation of the non&#8208;hydroxylated products germacrene A and germacrene D. In contrast, hydroxylation was maintained when the polar residues threonine, glutamine or aspartate replaced Ala176. Additionally, although a contribution of His150 to the nucleophilic water addition could be ruled out, the imidazole ring of His150 appears to assist carbocation stabilisation. The results presented here shed light on how hydroxylating sesquiterpene synthases can be engineered to design modified sesquiterpene synthases to reduce the need for further steps in the biocatalytic production of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids,</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ Generation of Hydrogen Polysulfides (H2Sn) with Thioglucose, Glucose Oxidase, and Chloroperoxidase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen polysulfides (H2Sn) have emerged as critical physiological mediators that are closely associated with hydrogen sulfide (H2S) signaling. H2Sn exhibit greater nucleophilicity than H2S while also having electrophilic characteristics, enabling unique activities such as protein S&#8208;persulfidation. Despite their physiological importance, mechanisms and reactivities of H2Sn remain inadequately explored due to their inherent instability in aqueous environments. Consequently, there is a need to develop biocompatible methods for controlled H2Sn generation to elucidate their behaviors in biological contexts. Herein, we present a dual enzyme system (containing glucose oxidase (GOx) and chloroperoxidase (CPO)) with thioglucose as the substrate to facilitate the controlled release of H2Sn. Fluorescence measurements with SSP4 and the trapping studies allowed us to confirm the production of H2Sn. Such a method may be useful in elucidating the reactivity of hydrogen polysulfides in biological systems as well as provide a potential delivery of H2Sn to target sites for biological applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The reported chemoenzymatic strategy involves the employment of vinyl 3&#8208;(dimethylamino)propanoate as an irreversible acyl donor in a chromatography&#8208;free lipase&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution (KR) of racemic sec&#8208;alcohols. This biotransformation is achieved in a sequential manner using CAL&#8208;B to affect the kinetic resolution, followed by a simple acidic extractive work&#8208;up furnishing both KR products with excellent enantioselectivity (E&gt;200; up to 98% ee). The elaborated method eliminates a single&#8208;use silica gel chromatographic separation and significantly reduces organic solvent consumption to foster a more environmentally friendly chemical industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Resolution of an Epitope Recognized by Blood Group Antibodies Capable of Binding Both A and B Red Blood Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high specificity of human antibodies to blood group A and B antigens is impressive, especially when considering the structural difference between these antigens (tetrasaccharides) is a NHAc versus a OH&#8208;group on the terminal monosaccharide residue. It is well established that in addition to anti&#8208;A and anti&#8208;B there is a third antibody, anti&#8208;A,B capable of recognizing both A and B antigens. To analyze this AB specificity, we synthesized a tetrasaccharide, where the NHAc of the A antigen was replaced with NH2. This NH2&#8208;group was used to attach the glycan to an affinity resin, creating an AB&#8208;epitope (ABep) adsorbent where the critical site for recognition by A and B antibodies was not accessible, while the rest of the (conformationally compact) tetrasaccharide remained accessible. Anti&#8208;ABep antibodies were isolated from blood group O donors and found to have expected A,B&#8208;specificity against immobilized and red cell bound synthetic antigens, including ABep, and were able to agglutinate both A and B red cells. The amount of these anti&#8208;ABep (anti&#8208;A,B) antibodies found in the blood of group O donors was comparable to levels of anti&#8208;A and anti&#8208;B found in group B and A individuals. Using STD&#8208;NMR the location for the AB&#8208;epitope on the tetrasaccharide was found.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is one of the most powerful techniques that meet the needs of analysis and detection in a variety of scenarios, because of its highly analytical sensitivity and excellent spatiotemporal controllability. ECL combined with microscopy (ECLM) offers a promising approach for quantifying and mapping a wide range of analytes. To date, ECLM has been widely used to image biological entities and processes, such as cells, subcellular structures, proteins and membrane transport properties. In this review, we first introduced the mechanisms of several classic ECL systems, then highlighted the progress of visual biosensing and bioimaging by ECLM in the last decade. Finally, the characteristics of ECLM were summarized, as well as some of the current challenges. The future research interests and potential directions for the application of ECLM were also outlooked.</dc:description>

         <title>New Frontiers in Nonheme Enzymatic Oxyferryl Species</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;heme mononuclear iron dependent (NHM&#8208;Fe) enzymes exhibit exceedingly diverse catalytic reactivities. Despite their catalytic versatilities, the mononuclear iron centers in these enzymes show a relatively simple architecture, in which an iron atom is ligated with 2&#8208;4 amino acid residues, including histidine, aspartic or glutamic acid. In the past two decades, a common high&#8208;valent reactive iron intermediate, the S = 2 oxoferryl (Fe(IV)&#8208;oxo or Fe(IV)=O) species, has been repeatedly discovered in NHM&#8208;Fe enzymes containing a 2&#8208;His&#8208;Fe or 2&#8208;His&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylate&#8208;Fe center. However, for 3&#8208;His/4&#8208;His&#8208;Fe enzymes, no common reactive intermediate has been identified. Recently, we have spectroscopically characterized the first S = 1 Fe(IV) intermediate in a 3&#8208;His&#8208;Fe containing enzyme, OvoA, which catalyzes a novel oxidative carbon&#8208;sulfur bond formation. In this review, we summarize the broad reactivities demonstrated by S = 2 Fe(IV)&#8208;oxo intermediates, the discovery of the first S = 1 Fe(IV) intermediate in OvoA and the mechanistic implication of such a discovery, and the intrinsic reactivity differences of the S = 2 and the S = 1 Fe(IV)&#8208;oxo species. Finally, we postulate the possible reasons to utilize an S = 1 Fe(IV) species in OvoA and their implications to other 3&#8208;His/4&#8208;His&#8208;Fe enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized DNA Origami&#8208;Enabled Detection of Biomarkers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An emerging field of study involves integrating sensing modules onto DNA origami structures, which allows for the robust detection of a wide range of biomarkers including nucleic acids, proteins, small molecules, and ions.







Abstract
Biomarkers are crucial physiological and pathological indicators in the host. Over the years, numerous detection methods have been developed for biomarkers, given their significant potential in various biological and biomedical applications. Among these, the detection system based on functionalized DNA origami has emerged as a promising approach due to its precise control over sensing modules, enabling sensitive, specific, and programmable biomarker detection. We summarize the advancements in biomarker detection using functionalized DNA origami, focusing on strategies for DNA origami functionalization, mechanisms of biomarker recognition, and applications in disease diagnosis and monitoring. These applications are organized into sections based on the type of biomarkers &#8211; nucleic acids, proteins, small molecules, and ions &#8211; and concludes with a discussion on the advantages and challenges associated with using functionalized DNA origami systems for biomarker detection.

         <title>Lysosomal Peptide Self&#8208;Assembly to Control Cell Behavior</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 12, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept describes an emerging approach to building functional nanostructures in lysosomes through non&#8208;covalent interactions for tuning lysosomal homeostasis, resulting in modulating cellular behaviors. We discuss several strategies for triggering peptide self&#8208;assembly in lysosomes and briefly discuss the prospects of this emerging field.







Abstract
Lysosomes are membrane&#8208;enclosed organelles that play key roles in degrading and recycling cellular debris, cellular signaling, and energy metabolism processes. Confinement of amphiphilic peptides in the lysosome to construct functional nanostructures through noncovalent interactions is an emerging approach to tune the homeostasis of lysosome. After briefly introducing the importance of lysosome and its functions, we discuss the advantages of lysosomal nanostructure formation for disease therapy. We next discuss the strategy for triggering the self&#8208;assembly of peptides in the lysosome, followed by a concise outlook of the future perspective about this emerging research direction.

         <title>SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Protein&#8208;Derived Cyclic Peptides as Modulators of Spike Interaction with GRP78</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 12, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chaperone protein GRP78 mediates cell entry by various pathogens, including SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Cyclic peptides based on surface features of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein were synthesised and found to inhibit spike interaction with GRP78. Wuhan and Omicron spike sequences were compared with the known GRP78 ligand Pep42, with the Omicron&#8208;derived peptide showing the highest activity.







Abstract
The human glucose&#8208;regulated protein GRP78 is a human chaperone that translocactes to the cell surface when cells are under stress. Theoretical studies suggested it could be involved in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus entry to cells. In this work, we used in&#8197;vitro surface plasmon resonance&#8208;based assays to show that human GRP78 indeed binds to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein. We have designed and synthesised cyclic peptides based on the loop structure of amino acids 480&#8211;488 of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein S1 domain from the Wuhan and Omicron variants and showed that both peptides bind to GRP78. Consistent with the greater infectiousness of the Omicron variant, the Omicron&#8208;derived peptide displays slower dissociation from the target protein. Both peptides significantly inhibit the binding of wild&#8208;type S1 protein to the human protein GRP78 suggesting that further development of these cyclic peptide motifs may provide a viable route to novel anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 agents.

         <title>Identifying Potential SOS1 Inhibitors via Virtual Screening of Multiple Small Molecule Libraries against KRAS&#8208;SOS1 Interaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 12, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study aims to identify new SOS1 inhibitors that will disrupt the KRAS&#8208;SOS1 interaction through virtual screening studies. For this aim, small molecule databases were employed with an in&#8208;house virtual screening algorithm that integrates target&#8208;driven and ligand&#8208;based methodologies, resulting in the identification of potent SOS1 inhibitors.







Abstract
The RAS&#8208;MAPK signaling pathway, crucial for cell proliferation and differentiation, involves key proteins KRAS and SOS1. Mutations in the KRAS and SOS1 genes are implicated in various cancer types, including pancreatic, lung, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. There is considerable interest in identifying inhibitors targeting KRAS and SOS1 to explore potential therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment. In this study, advanced in silico techniques were employed to screen small molecule libraries at this interface, leading to the identification of promising lead compounds as potential SOS1 inhibitors. Comparative analysis of the average binding free energies of these predicted potent compounds with known SOS1 small molecule inhibitors revealed that the identified compounds display similar or even superior predicted binding affinities compared to the known inhibitors. These findings offer valuable insights into the potential of these compounds as candidates for further development as effective anti&#8208;cancer agents.

         <title>Biological Demands and Toxicity of Isoprenoid Precursors in Bacillus Subtilis Through Cell&#8208;Permeant Analogs of Isopentenyl Pyrophosphate and Dimethylallyl Pyrophosphate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 12, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) are the five&#8208;carbon precursors for all terpenes and are cell impermeant due to the negatively charged pyrophosphate. We report the delivery of cell permeant IPP and DMAPP into Bacillus subtilis and demonstrate growth rescue after inhibition with fosmidomycin. Additionally, we demonstrate the equivalent toxicity of IPP and DMAPP.







Abstract
Bacterial isoprenoids are necessary for many biological processes, including maintaining membrane integrity, facilitating intercellular communication, and preventing oxidative damage. All bacterial isoprenoids are biosynthesized from two five carbon structural isomers, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), which are cell impermeant. Herein, we demonstrate exogenous delivery of IPP and DMAPP into Bacillus subtilis by utilizing a self&#8208;immolative ester (SIE)&#8208;caging approach. We initially evaluated native B. subtilis esterase activity, which revealed a preference for short straight chain esters. We then examined the viability of the SIE&#8208;caging approach in B. subtilis and demonstrate that the released caging groups are well tolerated and the released IPP and DMAPP are bioavailable, such that isoprenoid biosynthesis can be rescued in the presence of pathway inhibitors. We further show that IPP and DMAPP are both toxic and inhibit growth of B. subtilis at the same concentration. Lastly, we establish the optimal ratio of IPP to DMAPP (5&#8201;:&#8201;1) for B. subtilis growth and find that, surprisingly, DMAPP alone is insufficient to rescue isoprenoid biosynthesis under high concentrations of fosmidomycin. These findings showcase the potential of the SIE&#8208;caging approach in B. subtilis and promise to both aid in novel isoprenoid discovery and to inform metabolic engineering efforts in bacteria.

A platinum&#8208;aluminum bimetallic salen complex combining senescence induction and in&#8197;situ cytotoxicity generation for pro&#8208;senescence cancer therapy.







Abstract
Cell senescence is defined as irreversible cell cycle arrest, which can be triggered by telomere shortening or by various types of genotoxic stress. Induction of senescence is emerging as a new strategy for the treatment of cancer, especially when sequentially combined with a second senolytic drug capable of killing the resulting senescent cells, however severely suffering from the undesired off&#8208;target side effects from the senolytic drugs. Here, we prepare a bimetalic platinum&#8208;aluminum salen complex (Alumiplatin) for cancer therapy&#8208;a combination of pro&#8208;senesence chemotherapy with in&#8197;situ senotherapy to avoid the side effects. The aluminum salen moiety, as a G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizer, enhances the salen's ability to induce cancer cell senescence and this phenotype is in turn sensitive to the cytotoxic activity of the monofunctional platinum moiety. It exhibits an excellent capability for inducing senescence, a potent cytotoxic activity against cancer cells both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo, and an improved safety profile compared to cisplatin. Therefore, Alumiplatin may be a good candidate to be further developed into safe and effective anticancer agents. This novel combination of cell senescence inducers with genotoxic drugs revolutionizes the therapy options of designing multi&#8208;targeting anticancer agents to improve the efficacy of anticancer therapies.

         <title>Co&#8208;Immobilization of ADH and GDH on Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework: An Effective Biocatalyst for Asymmetric Reduction of Ketones</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 12, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bio&#8208;composite material was prepared through in&#8197;situ co&#8208;immobilization of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) in metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework ZIF&#8208;8, the nano&#8208;cluster could serve as efficient heterogeneous reactor for asymmetric reduction of ketones, and can be recycled for several rounds.







Abstract
Chiral alcohols are not only important building blocks of various bioactive natural compounds and pharmaceuticals, but can serve as synthetic precursors for other valuable organic chemicals, thus the synthesis of these products is of great importance. Bio&#8208;catalysis represents one effective way to obtain these molecules, however, the weak stability and high cost of enzymes often hinder its broad application. In this work, we designed a biological nanoreactor by embedding alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) in metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework ZIF&#8208;8. The biocatalyst ADH&amp;GDH@ZIF&#8208;8 could be applied to the asymmetric reduction of a series of ketones to give chiral alcohols in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and with excellent enantioselectivities (&gt;99&#8201;%). In addition, the heterogeneous biocatalyst could be recycled and reused at least four times with slight activity decline. Moreover, E.&#8197;coli containing ADH and GDH was immobilized by ZIF&#8208;8 to form biocatalyst E.&#8197;coli@ZIF&#8208;8, which also exhibits good catalytic behaviours. Finally, the chiral alcohols are further converted to marketed drugs (R)&#8208;Fendiline, (S)&#8208;Rivastigmine and NPS R&#8208;568 respectively.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Based Recognition Agents of Histamine: A Biopanning Approach with Enhanced Specificity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 12, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Histamine is a biogenic amine that affects food quality and causes health problems. This study presents a unique biopanning method to identify histamine&#8208;binding peptides, excluding histidine&#8208;binding sequences. Synthesizing 12&#8208;mer peptides from selected phage sequences, our findings reveal these peptides as potential ligands for biosensor (SPR) applications.







Abstract
Histamine is a biogenic amine that poses a potential threat to public health due to its toxicological effects. In this study, we identified histamine&#8208;binding peptides by screening a random 12&#8208;mer peptide library, employing a novel biopanning approach that excluded histidine&#8208;binding sequences in the final round. This additional step enhanced the selectivity of the peptides and prevented interference from histidine during detection. The binding affinities of synthesized peptides to histamine were assessed using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Among the identified peptides, HBF10 (SGFRDGIEDFLW) and HBF26 (IPLENQHKIYST) showed significant affinity to histamine, with Ka values of 2.56&#215;104 (M&#8722;1) and 8.94&#215;104 (M&#8722;1), respectively. Notably, the identified peptides did not demonstrate binding affinity towards histidine, despite its structural similarity to histamine. Subsequently, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor surface was prepared by immobilizing the peptide HBF26 to investigate the potential of the peptide as a recognition agent for histamine detection. The findings suggest that the identified peptides have an affinity to histamine specifically, showcasing their potential applications as diagnostic agents with specific targeting capabilities.

&lt;p&gt;Histamine is a biogenic amine that affects food quality and causes health problems. This study presents a unique biopanning method to identify histamine-binding peptides, excluding histidine-binding sequences. Synthesizing 12-mer peptides from selected phage sequences, our findings reveal these peptides as potential ligands for biosensor (SPR) applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Histamine is a biogenic amine that poses a potential threat to public health due to its toxicological effects. In this study, we identified histamine-binding peptides by screening a random 12-mer peptide library, employing a novel biopanning approach that excluded histidine-binding sequences in the final round. This additional step enhanced the selectivity of the peptides and prevented interference from histidine during detection. The binding affinities of synthesized peptides to histamine were assessed using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Among the identified peptides, HBF10 (SGFRDGIEDFLW) and HBF26 (IPLENQHKIYST) showed significant affinity to histamine, with &lt;i&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; values of 2.56&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; (M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and 8.94&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; (M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), respectively. Notably, the identified peptides did not demonstrate binding affinity towards histidine, despite its structural similarity to histamine. Subsequently, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor surface was prepared by immobilizing the peptide HBF26 to investigate the potential of the peptide as a recognition agent for histamine detection.

         <title>Systematic Analysis of the Effect of Genomic Knock&#8208;Out of Non&#8208;Essential Promiscuous HAD&#8208;Like Phosphatases YcsE, YitU and YwtE on Flavin and Adenylate Content in Bacillus Subtilis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 12, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three HAD&#8208;like phosphatases &#8211; YcsE, YwtE and YitU &#8211; that catalyze dephosphorylation of one of the riboflavin biosynthesis intermediates are knocked out singly or in combinations inB. subtilis using CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 genome editing technology. The influence of the knockouts on bacterial fitness as well as on flavin and adenylate intracellular concentration is investigated.







Abstract
Studying the metabolic role of non&#8208;essential promiscuous enzymes is a challenging task, as genetic manipulations usually do not reveal at which point(s) of the metabolic network the enzymatic activity of such protein is beneficial for the organism. Each of the HAD&#8208;like phosphatases YcsE, YitU and YwtE of Bacillus subtilis catalyzes the dephosphorylation of 5&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;ribitylamino&#8208;uracil 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate, which is essential in the biosynthesis of riboflavin. Using CRISPR technology, we have found that the deletion of these genes, individually or in all possible combinations failed to cause riboflavin auxotrophy and did not result in significant growth changes. Analysis of flavin and adenylate content in B. subtilis knockout mutants showed that (i) there must be one or several still unidentified phosphatases that can replace the deleted proteins; (ii) such replacements, however, cannot fully restore the intracellular content of any of three flavins studied (riboflavin, FMN, FAD); (iii) whereas bacterial fitness was not significantly compromised by mutations, the intracellular balance of flavins and adenylates did show some significant changes.

         <title>The PR&#8208;10 Protein Pru p 1&#8201;is an Endonuclease that Preferentially Cleaves Single&#8211;Stranded RNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 12, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the function of Pru&#8197;p&#8201;1, a PR&#8208;10 protein from peach, identifying it as an endonuclease that preferentially cleaves single&#8208;stranded substrate RNAs. Employing mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate its preference for generating short oligonucleotides and reveal details of RNA binding and cleavage. Our findings, supported by a structure&#8211;based model, offer the first experimental insights into the mechanism by which PR&#8208;10 proteins engage in ribonuclease activity.







Abstract
Pathogenesis&#8211;related class 10 (PR&#8208;10) proteins play a crucial role in plant defense by acting as ribonucleases. The specific mechanism of action and substrate specificity of these proteins have remained largely unexplored so far. In this study, we elucidate the enzymatic activity of Pru&#8197;p&#8201;1, a PR&#8208;10 protein from peach. We demonstrate that this protein catalyzes the endonucleolytic backbone cleavage of RNA substrates into short oligonucleotides. Initial cleavage products, identified through kinetic analysis, can bind again, priming them for further degradation. NMR binding site mapping reveals that the large internal cavity of Pru&#8197;p&#8201;1, which is characteristic for PR&#8208;10 proteins, serves as an anchoring site for single&#8211;stranded ribonucleotide chains. We propose a structure&#8208;based mechanistic model that accounts for the observed cleavage patterns and the inhibitory effect of zeatin, a nucleoside analog, on the ribonuclease activity of Pru&#8197;p&#8201;1.

         <title>Systematic Evaluation of Benchmark G4 Probes and G4 Clinical Drugs using three Biophysical Methods: A Guideline to Evaluate Rapidly G4&#8208;Binding Affinity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 12, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We conducted a systematic affinity ranking of 11&#8197;popular G4 ligands vs 5&#8197;classical G4 sequences using FRET&#8208;melting, G4&#8208;FID assays and SPR. This comparative study enables the establishment of a precise affinity ranking of ligands while also highlighting discrepancies attributable to the limitations and characteristics of each assay.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplex DNA structures (G4) are proven to interfere with most genetic and epigenetic processes. Small molecules binding these structures (G4 ligands) are invaluable tools to probe G4&#8208;biology and address G4&#8208;druggability in various diseases (cancer, viral infections). However, the large number of reported G4 ligands (&gt;1000) could lead to confusion while selecting one for a given application. Herein we conducted a systematic affinity ranking of 11&#8197;popular G4 ligands vs 5&#8197;classical G4 sequences using FRET&#8208;melting, G4&#8208;FID assays and SPR. Interestingly SPR data globally align with the rankings obtained from the two semi&#8208;quantitative assays despite discrepancies due to limits and characteristics of each assay. In the whole, PhenDC3 emerges as the most potent binder irrespective of the G4 sequence. Immediately below PDS, PDC&#8208;360A, BRACO19, TMPyP4 and RHPS4 feature strong to medium binding again with poor G4 topology discrimination. More strikingly, the G4 drugs Quarfloxin, CX5461 and c&#8208;PDS exhibit weak affinity with all G4s studied. Finally, NMM and Cu&#8208;ttpy showed heterogeneous behaviors due, in part, to their physicochemical particularities poorly compatible with screening conditions. The remarkable properties of PhenDC3 led us to propose its use for benchmarking FRET&#8208;melting and G4&#8208;FID assays for rapid G4&#8208;affinity evaluation of newly developed ligands.

         <title>Enterolyin S, a Polythiazole&#8208;containing Hemolytic Peptide from Enterococcus caccae</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 12, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Streptolysin S (SLS)&#8208;type of linear azol(in)e&#8208;containing peptides (LAPs) belong to a family of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) known for their hemolytic activities. The chemical structure of SLS has remained elusive despite its discovery 85&#8197;years ago. We identified a novel SLS&#8208;type hemolytic LAP named Enterolysin S and characterized its unique post&#8208;translational modification as an unprecedented octathiazole.







Abstract
The &#946;&#8208;hemolytic factor streptolysin S (SLS) is an important linear azol(in)e&#8208;containing peptide (LAP) that contributes significantly to the virulence of Streptococcus pyogenes. Despite its discovery 85&#8197;years ago, SLS has evaded structural characterizing owing to its notoriously problematic physicochemical properties. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of a structurally analogous hemolytic peptide from Enterococcus caccae, termed enterolysin S (ELS). Through heterologous expression, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, chemoselective modification, and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, we found that ELS contains an intriguing contiguous octathiazole moiety. The discovery of ELS expands our knowledge of hemolytic LAPs by adding a new member to this virulence&#8208;promoting family of modified peptides.

         <title>Interactions of Phenylalanine Derivatives with Human Tyrosinase: Lessons from Experimental and Theoretical tudies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 12, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined experimental and computational studies of phenylalanine derivatives, with structures close to the L&#8211;DOPA, one of the natural substrates of human tyrosinase, provides conclusive evidence of their interactions with this enzyme. In particular, our findings indicate that the (S)&#8208;3&#8208;amino&#8208;tyrosine stands out as an amino phenol derivative with inhibitory properties.







Abstract
The pigmentation of the skin, modulated by different actors in melanogenesis, is mainly due to the melanins (protective pigments). In humans, these pigments&#8217; precursors are synthetized by an enzyme known as tyrosinase (TyH). The regulation of the enzyme activity by specific modulators (inhibitors or activators) can offer a means to fight hypo&#8208; and hyper&#8208;pigmentations responsible for medical, psychological and societal handicaps. Herein, we report the investigation of phenylalanine derivatives as TyH modulators. Interacting with the binuclear copper active site of the enzyme, phenylalanine derivatives combine effects induced by combination with known resorcinol inhibitors and natural substrate/intermediate (amino acid part). Computational studies including docking, molecular dynamics and free energy calculations combined with biological activity assays on isolated TyH and in human melanoma MNT&#8208;1 cells, and X&#8208;ray crystallography analyses with the TyH analogue Tyrp1, provide conclusive evidence of the interactions of phenylalanine derivatives with human tyrosinase. In particular, our findings indicate that an analogue of L&#8211;DOPA, namely (S)&#8208;3&#8208;amino&#8208;tyrosine, stands out as an amino phenol derivative with inhibitory properties against TyH.

         <title>Gold Nanoparticle Delivery of Glut1 SiRNA Facilitates Glucose Starvation Therapy in Lung Cancer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 12, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The AuNPs@anti&#8208;miR&#8208;21/siGlut1 nanoparticle delivers siRNA against Glut1 via miR&#8208;21 triggering a toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement reaction for lung cancer starvation therapy. The knockdown of Glut1 limits glucose uptake, and the AuNPs accelerate intracellular glucose consumption. Notably, the AuNPs@anti&#8208;miR&#8208;21/siGlut1 significantly inhibits A549 cell proliferation and xenograft tumor growth, underscoring its potential as an effective therapeutic strategy for lung cancer.







Abstract
Glucose transporter protein&#8208;1 (Glut1), is highly expressed in many cancer types and plays a crucial role in cancer progression through enhanced glucose transport. Its overexpression is associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis. Herein, the nucleic acids modified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was synthesized to deliver small interfering RNA (siRNA) against Glut1 by microRNA 21 (miR&#8208;21) triggers toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement reaction for lung cancer starvation therapy. Overexpression of miR&#8208;21 triggers toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement, releasing the siRNA to knockdown of Glut1 in cancer cell instead of normal cell. Furthermore, the glucose oxidase&#8208;like activity of the AuNPs accelerates intracellular glucose consumption, promoting cancer cell starvation. The engineered AuNPs@anti&#8208;miR&#8208;21/siGlut1 complex inhibits cancer cell proliferation, xenograft tumor growth and promotes apoptosis through glucose starvation and ROS cascade signaling, underscoring its potential as an effective therapeutic strategy for lung cancer.

         <title>AM404 Analogs as Activators of the 20S Isoform of the Human Proteasome</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 12, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inducing an increase in 20S proteasome activity through gate opening can occur using lipophilic molecules. Described here are derivatives of AM&#8208;404 which retain 20S proteasome stimulation with decreased toxicity.







Abstract
The proteasome is a multisubunit protease system responsible for the majority of the protein turnover in eukaryotic organisms. Dysregulation of this enzymatic complex leads to protein accumulation, subsequent aggregation, and ultimately diseased states; for that reason, positive modulation of its activity has been recently investigated as a therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative and age&#8208;related diseases. The small molecule AM404 was recently identified as an activator of the 20S isoform of the proteasome and further exploration of the scaffold revealed the importance of the polyunsaturated fatty acid chain to elicit activity. Herein, we report the investigation of the aromatic region of the scaffold and the evaluation of the small molecules in a variety of proteasome activity and protein degradation assays. We found that derivatives A22 and A23, compared to AM404, exhibit enhanced proteasome activity in biochemical and cellular proteasome assays and more favorable cellular viability profiles. Additionally, these compounds demonstrate the ability to degrade intrinsically disordered proteins, regardless of their molecular weight, and the ability to restore the proteasome activity in the presence of toxic oligomeric &#945;&#8208;Syn species in a biochemical setting.

         <title>Endogenous Antimicrobial&#8208;Immunomodulatory Molecules: Networking Biomolecules of Innate Immunity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 12, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A network of biomolecules (peptides, saccharides, lipids, nucleic acids, organic molecules, metal ions) endogenous to the human brain and exhibiting both antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities has been identified. This network constitutes a previously uncatalogued and collectively underappreciated immuno&#8208;active group of synergistic molecular responders within the innate immune system's first line of defence against invasive pathogens.







Abstract
Endogenous antimicrobial&#8208;immunomodulatory molecules (EAIMs) are essential to immune&#8208;mediated human health and evolution. Conventionally, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been regarded as the dominant endogenous antimicrobial molecule; however, AMPs are not sufficient to account for the full spectrum of antimicrobial&#8208;immunomodulatory duality occurring within the human body. The threat posed by pathogenic microbes is pervasive with the capacity for widespread impact across many organ systems and multiple biochemical pathways; accordingly, the host needs the capacity to react with an equally diverse response. This can be attained by having EAIMs that traverse the full range of molecular size (small to large molecules) and structural diversity (including molecules other than peptides). This review identifies multiple molecules (peptide/protein, lipid, carbohydrate, nucleic acid, small organic molecule, and metallic cation) as EAIMs and discusses the possibility of cooperative, additive effects amongst the various EAIM classes during the host response to a microbial assault. This comprehensive consideration of the full molecular diversity of EAIMs enables the conclusion that EAIMs constitute a previously uncatalogued structurally diverse and collectively underappreciated immuno&#8208;active group of integrated molecular responders within the innate immune system's first line of defence.

         <title>Chemistry of Strigolactones, Key Players in Plant Communication</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 12, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural strigolactones (SLs), plant hormones and allelochemicals are reviewed here as analogs, mimics and probes developed to study their biological activities. All stable isotope&#8208;labeled SLs, essential for the quantification of their corresponding SLs are also reviewed. The syntheses of all these compounds are presented. The knowledge about the perception of SL is reviewed as well as different inhibitors of their receptors.







Abstract
Today, the use of artificial pesticides is questionable and the adaptation to global warming is a necessity. The promotion of favorable natural interactions in the rhizosphere offers interesting perspectives for changing the type of agriculture. Strigolactones (SLs), the latest class of phytohormones to be discovered, are also chemical mediators in the rhizosphere. We present in this review the diversity of natural SLs, their analogs, mimics, and probes essential for the biological studies of this class of compounds. Their biosynthesis and access by organic synthesis are highlighted especially concerning noncanonical SLs, the more recently discovered natural SLs. Organic synthesis of analogs, stable isotope&#8208;labeled standards, mimics, and probes are also reviewed here. In the last part, the knowledge about the SL perception is described as well as the different inhibitors of SL receptors that have been developed.

         <title>Characterization of HphA: the First Enzyme in the Homologation Pathway of l&#8208;Phenylalanine and l&#8208;Tyrosine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Homologation of amino acids is the insertion or deletion of a methylene group to their side chain, which is a relatively uncommon chemical transformation observed in peptide natural product (NP) structure. Homologated amino acids can potentially make the NP more stable in a biological system, but its biosynthesis is yet to be understood. This study biochemically characterized the first of three unexplored enzymes in the homologation pathway of l&#8208;phenylalanine and l&#8208;tyrosine. Previously proposed reactions catalyzed by HphA were confirmed by reversed&#8208;phase high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry analysis. The substrate profile and kinetic parameters showed high selectivity for the natural substrates and their close analogs. The comparability of HphA to homologous enzymes in primary metabolic pathways, 2&#8208;isopropylmate synthase and homocitrate synthase which are involved in l&#8208;leucine and l&#8208;lysine biosynthesis, respectively, was validated by bioinformatical and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis studies. The knowledge obtained from this study has deepened the understanding of the homologation of amino acids, which can lead to future combinatorial biosynthesis and metabolic engineering studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Reprogramming Filamentous fd Viruses to Capture Copper Ions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Filamentous fd viruses are genetically modified to display C&#8208;terminal truncated variants of the Cu(II) specific peptide &#8222;HGFANVA&#8220; omitting the His(H) unit. Although wild type fd phages do not result in any mineralization, engineered viruses form mineralized assemblies upon Cu(II) exposure implying the enhanced Cu(II) capturing. Such reprogrammed biological materials might be applied as environmentally friendly bioremediation agents.







Abstract
C&#8208;terminal truncated variants (A, VA, NVA, ANVA, FANVA and GFANVA) of our recently identified Cu(II) specific peptide &#8220;HGFANVA&#8221; were displayed on filamentous fd phages. Wild type fd&#8208;tet and engineered virus variants were treated with 100&#8197;mM Cu(II) solution at a final phage concentration of 1011&#8197;vir/ml and 1012&#8197;vir/ml. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging before Cu(II) exposure showed &#8776;6&#8211;8&#8197;nm thick filamentous virus layer formation. Cu(II) treatment resulted in aggregated bundle&#8208;like assemblies with mineral deposition. HGFANVA phage formed aggregates with an excessive mineral coverage. As the virus concentration was 10&#8208;fold decreased, nanowire&#8208;like assemblies were observed for shorter peptide variants A, NVA and ANVA. Wild type fd phages did not show any mineral formation. Energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX) analyses revealed the presence of C and N peaks on phage organic material. Cu peak was only detected for engineered viruses. Metal ion binding of viruses was next investigated by enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analyses. Engineered viruses were able to bind Cu(II) forming mineralized intertwined structures although no His (H) unit was displayed. Such genetically reprogrammed virus based biological materials can be further applied for bioremediation studies to achieve a circular economy.

         <title>Task&#8208;Similarity is a Crucial Factor for Few&#8208;Shot Meta&#8208;Learning of Structure&#8208;Activity Relationships</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Meta&#8208;learning has emerged as a promising strategy to facilitate efficient few&#8208;shot model training for a specific target of interest. Here, we show that the performance of the meta&#8208;learned model critically depends on the correlation &#8211; captured in terms of molecular similarity and target activity &#8211; between the specific target of interest and the training data used to meta&#8208;learn the model.







Abstract
Machine learning models support computer&#8208;aided molecular design and compound optimization. However, the initial phases of drug discovery often face a scarcity of training data for these models. Meta&#8208;learning has emerged as a potentially promising strategy, harnessing the wealth of structure&#8208;activity data available for known targets to facilitate efficient few&#8208;shot model training for the specific target of interest. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of two different meta&#8208;learning methods, namely model&#8208;agnostic meta&#8208;learning (MAML) and adaptive deep kernel fitting (ADKF), specifically in the regression setting. We investigated how factors such as dataset size and the similarity of training tasks impact predictability. The results indicate that ADKF significantly outperformed both MAML and a single&#8208;task baseline model on the inhibition data. However, the performance of ADKF varied across different test tasks. Our findings suggest that considerable enhancements in performance can be anticipated primarily when the task of interest is similar to the tasks incorporated in the meta&#8208;learning process.

         <title>Probing Glycerolipid Metabolism using a Caged Clickable Glycerol&#8208;3&#8208;Phosphate Probe</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report describes a strategy for general metabolic labeling and imaging of glycerolipid metabolism using a caged and clickable glycerol 3&#8208;phosphate probe (SATE&#8208;G3P&#8208;N3). This probe is shown to infiltrate a wide range of lipids and enable detection, post&#8208;derivatization, and imaging in yeast cells.







Abstract
In this study, we present the probe SATE&#8208;G3P&#8208;N3 as a novel tool for metabolic labeling of glycerolipids (GLs) to investigate lipid metabolism in yeast cells. By introducing a clickable azide handle onto the glycerol backbone, this probe enables general labeling of glycerolipids. Additionally, this probe contains a caged phosphate moiety at the glycerol sn&#8208;3 position to not only facilitate probe uptake by masking negative charge but also to bypass the phosphorylation step crucial for initiating phospholipid synthesis, thereby enhancing phospholipid labeling. The metabolic labeling activity of the probe was thoroughly assessed through cellular fluorescence microscopy, mass spectrometry (MS), and thin&#8208;layer chromatography (TLC) experiments. Fluorescence microscopy analysis demonstrated successful incorporation of the probe into yeast cells, with labeling predominantly localized at the plasma membrane. LCMS analysis confirmed metabolic labeling of various phospholipid species (PC, PS, PA, PI, and PG) and neutral lipids (MAG, DAG, and TAG), and GL labeling was corroborated by TLC. These results showcased the potential of the SATE&#8208;G3P&#8208;N3 probe in studying GL metabolism, offering a versatile and valuable approach to explore the intricate dynamics of lipids in yeast cells.

         <title>Synthesis of New Bodipy Hydrazide Fluorescent Probes for the Detection of Carbonylated Proteins Generated by Oxidative Stress</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insert text for Table of Contents here. We report the design and the synthesis of new BODIPY possessing a hydrazide function (BODIPY&#8722;Hz), an emission in the near&#8208;infra red area and high quantum yield. We show the use of these new BODIPY&#8722;Hz as fluorescent probes for carbonylated proteins labeling. We demonstrate that the new BODIPY&#8722;Hz are compatible with the 2D&#8208;Oxi electrophoresis technology, and that it can be used directly for proteins labeling in cells monitored by fluorescence microscopy.







Abstract
Oxidative stress is a cellular disorder implicated in various severe diseases and redox biology and represents an important field of research for the last decades. One of the major consequences of oxidative stress is the carbonylation of proteins, which is also a reliable marker to assess protein oxidative modifications. Accumulation of carbonylated proteins has been associated with aging and age&#8208;related diseases and can ultimately causes cell death. Detection of these oxidative modifications is essential to understand and discover new treatments against oxidative stress. We describe the design and the synthetic pathway of new BODIPY fluorescent probes functionalized with hydrazide function for protein carbonyl labeling to improve existing methodologies such as 2D&#8208;Oxi electrophoresis. Hydrazide BODIPY analogues show very good fluorescent properties such as NIR emission up to 633&#8197;nm and quantum yield up to 0.88. These new probes were validated for the detection and quantification of carbonylated proteins with 2D&#8208;Oxi electrophoresis using mouse muscle protein extracts, as well as both flow cytometry and microscopy using oxidant stressed C2 C12 cells.

         <title>Structures and protein engineering of the &#945;&#8208;keto acid C&#8208;methyltransferases SgvM and MrsA for rational substrate transfer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>S&#8209;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine&#8208;dependent methyltransferases (MTs) are involved in the C&#8208;methylation of a variety of natural products. The MTs SgvM from Streptomyces griseoviridis and MrsA from Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae catalyze the methylation of the &#946;&#8208;carbon atom of &#945;&#8208;keto acids in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic natural products viridogrisein and 3&#8209;methylarginine, respectively. MrsA shows high substrate selectivity for 5&#8209;guanidino&#8208;2&#8208;oxovalerate, while other &#945;&#8208;keto acids, such as the SgvM substrates 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxovalerate, 2&#8208;oxovalerate, and phenylpyruvate, are not accepted. Here we report the crystal structures of SgvM and MrsA in the apo form bound with substrate or S&#8209;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine. By investigating key residues for substrate recognition in the active sites of both enzymes and engineering MrsA by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, the substrate range of MrsA was extended to accept &#945;&#8209;keto acid substrates of SgvM with uncharged and lipophilic &#946;&#8209;residues. Our results showcase the transfer of the substrate scope of &#945;&#8208;keto acid MTs from different biosynthetic pathways by rational design.</dc:description>

         <title>Amodiaquine Nonspecifically Binds Double Stranded and Three&#8208;Way Junction DNA Structures</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding of amodiaquine, mefloquine, chloroquine and quinine to different DNA structures was studied using isothermal titration calorimetry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Amodiaquine tightly binds to all DNA structures studied while other ligands are more selective in which DNA structures they bind. Trends in calculated binding free energy versus the experimental results of amodiaquine binding a DNA dodecamer match.







Abstract
The 4&#8208;aminoquinoline class of compounds includes the important antimalarial compounds amodiaquine and chloroquine. Despite their medicinal importance, the mode of action of these compounds is poorly understood. In a previous study we observed these compounds, as well as quinine and mefloquine, tightly bind the DNA cocaine&#8208;binding aptamer. Here, we further explore the range of nucleic acid structures bound by these compounds. To gauge a wide range of binding affinities, we used isothermal titration calorimetry to explore high affinity binding (nM to tens of &#956;M) and NMR spectroscopy to assay weak binding biding in the hundreds of micromolar range. We find that amodiaquine tightly binds all double stranded DNA structures explored. Mefloquine binds double stranded DNA duplex molecules tightly and weakly associates with a three&#8208;way junction DNA construct. Quinine and chloroquine only weakly bind duplex DNA but do not tightly bind any of the DNA constructs explored. A simulation of the free energy of binding of these ligands to the Dickerson&#8208;Drew dodecamer resulted in an excellent agreement between the simulated and experimental free energy. These results provide new insight into the DNA binding of clinically important antimalarial compounds and may play a role in future development of new antimalarials.

         <title>Thermal Proteome Profiling Reveals Insight to Antiproliferative and Pro&#8208;Apoptotic Effects of Lagunamide A in the Modulation of DNA Damage Repair</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using TPP (Thermal Proteome Profiling) we identify EYA3 as component of the molecular mode of action of the natural compound Lagunamide A (Lag A). Lag A targeting the DNA damage repair process sets a promising starting point to study basic chemotherapy resistance mechanisms and to develop more effective chemo&#8208;sensitizing drugs.







Abstract
Lagunamide A is a biologically active natural product with a yet unidentified molecular mode of action. Cellular studies revealed that lagunamide A is a potent inhibitor of cancer cell proliferation, promotes apoptosis and causes mitochondrial dysfunction. To decipher the cellular mechanism responsible for these effects, we utilized thermal protein profiling (TPP) and identified EYA3 as a stabilized protein in cells upon lagunamide A treatment. EYA3, involved in the DNA damage repair process, was functionally investigated via siRNA based knockdown studies and corresponding effects of lagunamide A on DNA repair were confirmed. Furthermore, we showed that lagunamide A sensitized tumor cells to treatment with the drug doxorubicin highlighting a putative therapeutic strategy.

         <title>Multifunctional DNA Nanoflower Applied for High Specific Photodynamic Cancer Therapy In Vivo</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of DNA based nanostructure was constructed. This DNA nanoflower structure can targeted deliver photosensitizer molecules into cancer cells, thus can be applied for specific photodynamic therapy for tumor treatment.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a newly emerged strategy for disease treatment. One challenge of the application of PDT drugs is the side&#8208;effect caused by the non&#8208;specificity of the photosensitive molecules. Most of the photosensitizers may invade not only the pathogenic cells but also the normal cells. In recent, people tried to use special cargoes to deliver the drugs into target cells. DNA nanoflowers (NFs) are a kind of newly&#8208;emerged nanomaterial which constructed through DNA rolling cycle amplification (RCA) reaction. It is reported that the DNA NFs were suitable materials which have been widely applied as nanocargos for drug delivery in cancer chemotherapeutic treatment. In this paper, we have introduced a new multifunctional DNA NF which could be prepared through an one&#8208;pot RCA reaction. This proposed DNA NF contained a versatile AS1411 G&#8208;quadruplex moiety, which plays key roles not only for specific recognition of cancer cells but also for near&#8208;infrared ray based photodynamic therapy when conjugating with a special porphyrin molecule. We demonstrated that the DNA NF showed good selectivity toward cancer cells, leading to highly efficient photo&#8208;induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, the in&#8197;vivo experiment results suggested this DNA NF is a promising nanomaterial for clinical PDT.

         <title>Inhibition of RNA Phosphodiester Backbone Cleavage in the Presence of Organic Cations of Different Sizes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>

The steric hindrance effect of organic cations on their binding to the RNA backbone is significant when the cation size is larger than the phosphate&#8211;phosphate distance of a single&#8208;stranded nucleic acid. The results of the study show that the nucleic acid&#8211;binding properties of bulky cations comprising alkyl chains or benzene rings are distinct from those of metal ions.







Abstract
Living cells contain various types of organic cations that may interact with nucleic acids. In order to understand the nucleic acid&#8211;binding properties of organic cations of different sizes, we investigated the ability of simple organic cations to inhibit the RNA phosphodiester bond cleavage promoted by Mg2+, Pb2+, and RNA&#8208;cleaving serum proteins. Kinetic analysis using chimeric DNA&#8211;RNA oligonucleotides showed that the cleavage at ribonucleotide sites was inhibited in the presence of monovalent cations comprising alkyl chains or benzene rings. The comparison of the cleavage rates in the presence of quaternary ammonium and phosphonium ions indicated that the steric hindrance effect of organic cations on their binding to the RNA backbone is significant when the cation size is larger than the phosphate&#8211;phosphate distance of a single&#8208;stranded nucleic acid. The cleavage inhibition was also observed for ribonucleotides located in long loops but not in short loops of oligonucleotide structures, indicating less efficient binding of bulky cations to structurally constrained regions. These results reveal the unique nucleic acid&#8211;binding properties of bulky cations distinct from those of metal ions.

         <title>Synthesis and Thermodynamic Evaluation of Sialyl&#8208;Tn MUC1 Glycopeptides Binding to Macrophage Galactose&#8208;Type Lectin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interactions between the tumor&#8208;associated carbohydrate antigens of Mucin 1 (MUC1) and the carbohydrate&#8208;binding proteins, lectins, often lead to the creation of a pro&#8208;tumor microenvironment favoring tumor initiation, progression, metastasis, and immune evasion. Macrophage galactose binding lectin (MGL) is a C&#8208;type lectin receptor found on antigen&#8208;presenting cells that facilitates the uptake of carbohydrate antigens for antigen presentation, modulating the immune response homeostasis, autoimmunity, and cancer. Considering the crucial role of tumor&#8208;associated forms of MUC1 and MGL in tumor immunology, a thorough understanding of their binding interaction is essential for it to be exploited for cancer vaccine strategies. The synthesis of MUC1 glycopeptide models carrying a single or multiple Tn and/or sialyl&#8208;Tn antigen(s) is described. A novel approach for the sialyl&#8208;Tn threonine building block suitable for the solid phase peptide synthesis was developed. The thermodynamic profile of the binding interaction between the human MGL and MUC1 glycopeptide models was analyzed using isothermal titration calorimetry. The measured dissociation constants for the sialyl&#8208;Tn&#8208;bearing peptide epitopes were consistently lower compared to the Tn antigen and ranged from 10 &#956;M for mono&#8208; to 100 nM for triglycosylated MUC1 peptide, respectively. All studied interactions, regardless of the glycan&#8217;s site of attachment or density, exhibited enthalpy&#8208;driven thermodynamics.</dc:description>

         <title>Super&#8208;resolution imaging reveals the mechanism of endosomal acidification inhibitors against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, super&#8208;resolution structured illumination microscope (SIM) was used to analyze molecular mechanism of endocytic acidification inhibitors in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 pandemic, such as Chloroquine (CQ), Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1). We fluorescently labeled the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RBD and its receptor ACE2 protein with small molecule dyes. Utilizing SIM imaging, the real&#8208;time impact of inhibitors (BafA1, CQ, HCQ, Dynasore) on the RBD&#8208;ACE2 endocytotic process was dynamically tracked in living cells. Initially, the protein activity of RBD and ACE2 was ensured after being labeled. And then our findings revealed that these inhibitors could inhibit the internalization and degradation of RBD&#8208;ACE2 to varying degrees. Among them, 100 nM BafA1 exhibited the most satisfactory endocytotic inhibition (~63.9%) and protein degradation inhibition (~97.7%). And it could inhibit the fusion between endocytic vesicles in the living cells. Additionally, Dynasore, a widely recognized dynein inhibitor, also demonstrated cell acidification inhibition effects. Together, these inhibitors collectively hinder SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection by inhibiting both the viral internalization and RNA release. The comprehensive evaluation of pharmacological mechanisms through super&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging has laid a crucial theoretical foundation for the development of potential drugs to treat COVID&#8208;19.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzofuran Iboga&#8208;analogs Modulate Nociception and Inflammation in an Acute Mouse Pain Model</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pain management following acute injury or post&#8208;operative procedures is highly necessary for proper recovery and quality of life. Opioids and non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) have been used for this purpose, but opioids cause addiction and withdrawal symptoms whereas NSAIDS have several systemic toxicities. Derivatives of the naturally occurring iboga alkaloids have previously shown promising behavior in anti&#8208;addiction of morphine by virtue of their interaction with opioid receptors. On this frontier, four benzofuran analogs of the iboga family have been synthesized and their analgesic effects have been studied in formalin induced acute pain model in Swiss albino mice at 30 mg/kg of body weight dose administered intraperitoneally. The antioxidant, anti&#8208;inflammatory and neuro&#8208;modulatory effects of the analogs were analyzed. Reversal of tail flick latency, restricted locomotion and anxiogenic behavior were observed in iboga alcohol, primary amide and secondary amide. Local neuroinflammatory mediators&#8217; substance P, calcitonin gene related peptide, cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 and p65 were significantly decreased whereas the depletion of brain derived neurotrophic factor and glia derived neurotrophic factor was overturned on iboga analog treatment. Behavioral patterns after oral administration of the best analog were also analyzed. Taken together, these results show that the iboga family of alkaloid has huge potential in pain management.</dc:description>

         <title>Rationally Designed Peptoid Inhibitors of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Oligomerization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When SH&#8208;SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were incubated with 4&#8197;&#956;M A&#946;1&#8208;42 oligomers (Control), increased nuclear factor&#8208;&#954;B (NF&#8208;&#954;B) activation was visualized. However, when the cells incubated with 4&#8197;&#956;M A&#946;1&#8208;42 oligomers formed in the presence of peptoids that modulate oligomer formation (JPT1, JPT1_I6K, or JPT1_I6E), significant attenuation of NF&#8208;&#954;B activation was observed.







Abstract
While plaques comprised of fibrillar A&#946; aggregates are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, soluble A&#946; oligomers present higher neurotoxicity. Thus, one therapeutic approach is to prevent the formation of A&#946; oligomers and reduce their associated harmful effects. We have proposed a peptoid mimic of the A&#946; hydrophobic KLVFF core as an ideal candidate aggregation inhibitor due to its ability to evade proteolytic degradation via repositioning of the side chain from the &#945;&#8208;carbon to the amide nitrogen. This peptoid, JPT1, utilizes chiral sidechains to achieve a helical structure, while C&#8208;terminal addition of two phenylalanine residues places aromatic groups on two sides of the helix with spacing designed to facilitate interaction with amyloid &#946;&#8208;sheet structure. We have previously shown that JPT1 modulates A&#946; fibril formation. Here, we demonstrate that JPT1 also modulates A&#946; oligomerization, and we explore the role of the charge on the linker between the KLVFF mimic and the extended aromatic residues. Additionally, we demonstrate that peptoid&#8208;induced changes in A&#946; oligomerization correlate with attenuation of oligomer&#8208;induced nuclear factor&#8208;&#954;B activation in SH&#8208;SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. These findings support the therapeutic potential of peptoids to target early stages of A&#946; aggregation and impact the associated A&#946;&#8208;induced cellular response.

         <title>A Naphthalimide Based &#8220;Turn&#8208;ON&#8221; Probe for Wash&#8208;Free Imaging of Lipid&#8208;Droplet in Living Cells With an Excellent Selectivity</title>

Due to its turn&#8208;ON response to apolar environment, the 4&#8208;DiMe&#8208;ANI enables wash&#8208;free imaging of lipid droplets in living cells with excellent LD/cytosol signal ratio







Abstract
The impacts of dimethylation of 4&#8208;Amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;Naphthalimide (ANI) on its photophysical properties are reported. The resulting 4&#8208;DiMe&#8208;ANI displays completely different fluorescence properties, conferring it ability to selectively label lipid droplets in living cells. A comprehensive photophysical study revealed that this selectivity arises from an Internal Charge Transfer favored in lipophilic media to the detriment of a non&#8208;emissive TICT in more polar media. This results in a very high &#8220;LDs/Cytosol&#8221; signal ratio, enabling LDs to be imaged with an excellent signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, and positioning its performance above that of the BODIPY 493/503 commonly used to image LDs.

         <title>Using LanM Enzymes to Modify Glucagon&#8208;Like Peptides 1 and 2 in E.coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptides serve as important drugs but suffer from short lifetimes in circulation. The lifetime can be extended by installing chemical modifications, but these can be expensive to incorporate. We show that production, as well as modifications with non&#8208;proteogenic amino acids, can be accomplished in E.coli by exploiting enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs).







Abstract
Selective modification of peptides is often exploited to improve pharmaceutically relevant properties of bioactive peptides like stability, circulation time, and potency. In Nature, natural products belonging to the class of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are known to install a number of highly attractive modifications with high selectivity. These modifications are installed by enzymes guided to the peptide by corresponding leader peptides that are removed as the last step of biosynthesis. Here, we exploit leader peptides and their matching enzymes to investigate the installation of D&#8208;Ala post&#8208;translationally in a critical position in the hormones, glucagon&#8208;like peptides (GLP) 1 and 2. We also offer insight into how precursor peptide design can modulate the modification pattern achieved.

         <title>Role of Amyloidogenic and Non&#8208;Amyloidogenic Protein Spaces in Neurodegenerative Diseases and their Mitigation Using Theranostic Agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) encompass a spectrum of overlapping disorders marked by abnormal protein aggregation, resulting in the formation of toxic amyloid aggregation species. Additionally, these diseases involve dysregulated expression and function of proteins associated with various overlapping pathologies. This review delves into the protein fibril spaces linked to NDDs. Furthermore, evolving theranostic agents, which serve as valuable chemical tools, aid in both diagnosis and treatment, contributing to the improved management of these intricate disorders are discussed.







Abstract
Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) refer to a complex heterogeneous group of diseases which are associated with the accumulation of amyloid fibrils or plaques in the brain leading to progressive loss of neuronal functions. Alzheimer's disease is one of the major NDD responsible for 60&#8211;80&#8201;% of all dementia cases. Currently, there are no curative or disease&#8208;reversing/modifying molecules for many of the NDDs except a few such as donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, carbidopa and levodopa which treat the disease&#8208;associated symptoms. Similarly, there are very few FDA&#8208;approved tracers such as flortaucipir (Tauvid) for tau fibril imaging and florbetaben (Neuraceq), flutemetamol (Vizamyl), and florbetapir (Amyvid) for amyloid imaging available for diagnosis. Recent advances in the cryogenic electron microscopy reported distinctly different microstructures for tau fibrils associated with different tauopathies highlighting the possibility to develop tauopathy&#8208;specific imaging agents and therapeutics. In addition, it is important to identify the proteins that are associated with disease development and progression to know about their 3D structure to develop various diagnostics, therapeutics and theranostic agents. The current article discusses in detail the disease&#8208;associated amyloid and non&#8208;amyloid proteins along with their structural insights. We comprehensively discussed various novel proteins associated with NDDs and their implications in disease pathology. In addition, we document various emerging chemical compounds developed for diagnosis and therapy of different NDDs with special emphasis on theranostic agents for better management of NDDs.

         <title>Amplification&#8208; and Enzyme&#8208;Free Magnetic Diagnostics Circuit for Whole&#8208;Genome Detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a first&#8208;in&#8208;class magnetic signal amplification circuit (MAC) for detecting SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA genome. The MAC combines the specificity of toehold&#8208;mediated DNA strand displacement with the sensitivity of magnetic response of MNPs to declustering processes. Using MAC, we detected the N gene of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in an amplification&#8208;, enzyme&#8208; and wash&#8208;free manner at 25&#8201;&#176;C at a concentration of 104 RNA copies/&#956;l.







Abstract
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) requires thermal cycling and enzymatic reactions for sequence amplification, hampering their applications in point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) settings. Magnetic bioassays based on magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS) and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are isothermal, wash&#8208;free, and can be quantitative. Realizing them amplification&#8208; and enzyme&#8208;free on a benchtop device, they will become irreplaceable for POC applications. Here we demonstrate a first&#8208;in&#8208;class magnetic signal amplification circuit (MAC) that enables detection of whole genome of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 by combining the specificity of toehold&#8208;mediated DNA strand displacement with the magnetic response of MNPs to declustering processes. Using MAC, we detect the N gene of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 samples at a concentration of 104 RNA copies/&#956;l as determined by droplet digital PCR. Further, we demonstrate that MAC can reliably distinguish between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and other human coronaviruses. Being a wash&#8208;, amplification&#8208; and enzyme&#8208;free biosensing concept and working at isothermal conditions (25&#8201;&#176;C) on a low&#8208;cost benchtop MPS device, our MAC biosensing concept offers several indispensable features for translating nucleic acid detection to POC applications.

         <title>An Assay for Immunogenic Detection of Anti&#8208;PEG Antibody</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the increasing use of polyethylene glycol (PEG) based proteins and drug delivery systems, anti&#8208;PEG antibodies have commonly been detected among the population, causing the accelerated blood clearance and hypersensitivity reactions, poses potential risks to the clinical efficacy and safety of PEGylated drugs. Therefore, vigilant monitoring of anti&#8208;PEG antibodies is crucial for both research and clinical guidance regarding PEGylated drugs. The enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a common method for detecting anti&#8208;PEG antibodies. However, diverse coating methods, blocking solutions and washing solutions have been employed across different studies, and unsuitable use of Tween 20 as the surfactant even caused biased results. In this study, we established the optimal substrate coating conditions, and investigated the influence of various surfactants and blocking solutions on the detection accuracy. The findings revealed that incorporating 1% bovine serum albumin into the serum dilution in the absence of surfactants will result the credible outcomes of anti&#8208;PEG antibody detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Immunomodulatory Synthetic Glycocluster Molecule Prevents Melanoma Growth in vivo</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triacedimannose (TADM) is a synthetic trivalent acetylated glycocluster and a transmembrane macrophage activator independent of the mannose receptor. TADM induces Th1&#8208;type immune responses and suppresses Th2&#8208;type cytokines in acute and chronic allergic inflammation models in vivo. We, therefore, wanted to test whether TADM could also facilitate anti&#8208;tumour tissue responses similar to what has been observed for the immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 and anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4. A syngeneic mouse melanoma model was selected since metastatic melanoma has been successfully targeted by checkpoint inhibitors in the clinic. TADM inhibited the growth of B16 mouse melanoma tumours at levels comparable to an anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody. TADM&#8208;treated tumours encompassed significantly more apoptotic cells as measured by TUNEL staining, and interferon&#8208;gamma (IFN&#8208;&#947;) expression was increased in the spleens of TADM&#8208;treated mice compared to untreated controls. TADM&#8208;treated mice also demonstrated increased Ly6C low monocytes and neutrophils in the spleens. However, TADM&#8208;treated tumours showed no discernible differences in infiltrating immune cells. TADM can alone suppress the growth of melanoma tumours. TADM likely activates M1 type macrophages, type N1 neutrophils, and CD8+ and Th1 T cells, suppressing the type 2 immune response milieu of melanoma tumour with a strong type 1 immune response.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Forming nano&#8208;assemblies is essential for delivering DNA conjugates into cells, with the DNA density in the nano&#8208;assembly playing an important role in determining the uptake efficiency. In this study, we developed a strategy for the facile synthesis of DNA strands bearing perfluoroalkyl (RF) groups (RF&#8208;DNA conjugates) and investigated how they affect cellular uptake. An RF&#8208;DNA conjugate bearing a long RF group at the DNA terminus forms a nano&#8208;assembly with a high DNA density, which results in greatly enhanced cellular uptake. The uptake mechanism is mediated by clathrin&#8208;dependent endocytosis. The use of RF groups to densely assemble negatively charged DNA is a useful strategy for designing drug delivery carriers.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding and Stabilization of a Semiquinone Radical by an Artificial Metalloenzyme Containing a Binuclear Copper (II) Cofactor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial metalloenzyme was obtained by insertion of a binuclear copper complex coupled to a lauric acid anchor into &#946;&#8208;lactoglobulin, using the Trojan Horse strategy. The resulting biohybrid did not show any catecholase activity as it efficiently stabilized the intermediate 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;semi&#8208;quinone radical (DTB&#8208;SQ).







Abstract
A binuclear Cu(II) cofactor was covalently bound to a lauric acid anchor. The resulting conjugate was characterized then combined with beta&#8208;lactoglobulin (&#946;LG) to generate a new biohybrid following the so&#8208;called &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; strategy. This biohybrid was examined for its effectiveness in the oxidation of a catechol derivative to the corresponding quinone. The resulting biohybrid did not exhibit the sought after catecholase activity, likely due to its ability to bind and stabilize the semiquinone radical intermediate DTB&#8208;SQ. This semi&#8208;quinone radical was stabilized only in the presence of the protein and was characterized using optical and magnetic spectroscopic techniques, demonstrating stability for over 16&#8197;hours. Molecular docking studies revealed that this stabilization could occur owing to interactions of the semi&#8208;quinone with hydrophobic amino acid residues of &#946;LG.

         <title>Improvement of Heterologous Soluble Expression of L&#8208;amino Acid Oxidase Using Logistic Regression</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enhance enzyme applications, we developed a novel and effective technique for increasing the heterologous soluble expression of L&#8208;amino acid oxidase in Escherichia coli by using statistical analysis and random mutagenesis to modify 108 amino acids. The effectiveness and usefulness of the developed logistic regression model were also demonstrated by analyzing and verifying the predicted values.







Abstract
Successful implementation of enzymes in practical application hinges on the development of efficient mass production techniques. However, in a heterologous expression system, the protein is often unable to fold correctly and, thus, forms inclusion bodies, resulting in the loss of its original activity. In this study, we present a new and more accurate model for predicting amino acids associated with an increased L&#8208;amino acid oxidase (LAO) solubility. Expressing LAO from Rhizoctonia solani in Escherichia coli and combining random mutagenesis and statistical logistic regression, we modified 108 amino acid residues by substituting hydrophobic amino acids with serine and hydrophilic amino acids with alanine. Our results indicated that specific mutations in Euclidean distance, glycine, methionine, and secondary structure increased LAO expression. Furthermore, repeated mutations were performed for LAO based on logistic regression models. The mutated LAO displayed a significantly increased solubility, with the 6&#8208;point and 58&#8208;point mutants showing a 2.64&#8208; and 4.22&#8208;fold increase, respectively, compared with WT&#8208;LAO. Ultimately, using recombinant LAO in the biotransformation of &#945;&#8208;keto acids indicates its great potential as a biocatalyst in industrial production.

         <title>Controllable silver release for efficient treatment of drug&#8208;resistant bacterial&#8208;infected wounds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of traditional Ag&#8208;based antibacterial agents is usually accompanied by uncontrollable silver release, which makes it difficult to find a balance between antibacterial performance and biosafety. Herein, we prepared a core&#8208;shell system of ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;derived amorphous carbon&#8208;coated Ag nanoparticles (Ag@C) as an ideal research model to reveal the synergistic effect and structure&#8208;activity relationship of the structural transformation of carbon shell and Ag core on the regulation of silver release behavior. It is found that Ag@C prepared at 600 &#176;C (AC6) exhibits the best ion release kinetics due to the combination of relatively simple shell structure and lower crystallinity of Ag core, thereby exerting stronger antibacterial properties (&gt; 99.999%) at trace doses (20 &#956;g mL&#8208;1) compared with most other Ag&#8208;based materials. Meanwhile, the carbon shell prevents the metal Ag from being directly exposed to the organism and thus endows AC6 with excellent biocompatibility. In animal experiments, AC6 can effectively promote wound healing by inactivating drug&#8208;resistant bacteria while regulating the expression of TNF&#8208;&#945; and CD31. This work provides theoretical support for the scientific design and clinical application of controllable ion&#8208;releasing antibacterial agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Hemicyanine&#8208;Based Highly Water&#8208;soluble Probe for Extracellular Nitroreductase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitroreductase (NTR) has long been a target of interest for its important role involved in the nitro compounds metabolism. Various probes have been reported for NTR analysis, but rarely able to distinguish the extracellular NTR from intracellular ones. Herein we reported a new NTR sensor, HCyS&#8208;NO2, which was a hemicyanine molecule with one nitro and two sulfo groups attached. The nitro group acted as the reporting group to respond NTR reduction. Direct linkage of nitro group into the hemicyanine &#960; conjugate system facilitated the intramolecular electron transfer (IET) process and thus quenched the fluorescence of hemicyanine core. Upon reduction with NTR, the nitro group was rapidly converted into the hydroxylamino and then the amino group, eliminating IET process and thus restoring the fluorescence. The sulfo groups installed significantly increased the hydrophilicity of the molecule, and introduced negative charges at physiological pH, preventing the diffusion into bacteria. Both gram&#8208;negative and gram&#8208;positive bacteria were able to turn on the fluorescence of HCyS&#8208;NO2, without detectable diffusion into cells, providing a useful tool to probe the extracellular reduction process.</dc:description>

         <title>The Post&#8208;Polyketide Synthase Modification Mechanism in Hitachimycin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hitachimycin is a bicyclic macrolactam antibiotic with (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;phenylalanine (&#946;&#8208;Phe) at the starter position of the polyketide skeleton. While the enzymes that recognize &#946;&#8208;amino acids, modify the aminoacyl groups, and transfer the resultant dipeptide groups to the acyl carrier protein domains of polyketide synthases (PKSs) have been studied extensively, the post&#8208;PKS modification mechanism responsible for constructing the unique bicyclic structure of hitachimycin remains elusive. In this study, we first inactivated six genes encoding putative post&#8208;PKS modification enzymes, namely hitM1 to hitM6, in Streptomyces scabrisporus to determine their involvement in hitachimycin biosynthesis. The &#916;hitM4 strain accumulated an all&#8208;trans&#8208;2,4,6,8,18&#8208;pentaene macrolactam, which was confirmed as a true intermediate in hitachimycin biosynthesis by cellular feeding experiments, and appears to be the initial intermediate in the post&#8208;PKS modification pathway. The &#916;hitM1 strain accumulated 10&#8208;O&#8208;demethyl&#8208;10&#8208;oxohitachimycin (M1&#8208;A). In enzymatic experiments, M1&#8208;A was reduced by the NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent reductase HitM1 in the presence of NADPH. The product of the reaction catalyzed by HitM1 was converted to hitachimycin by the methyltransferase HitM6. We thus propose a plausible post&#8208;PKS modification mechanism for the biosynthesis of hitachimycin.</dc:description>

         <title>ATOMISTIC CHARACTERIZATION OF HEALTHY AND DAMAGED HAIR SURFACES: A MOLECULAR DYNAMICS STUDY OF FATTY ACIDS ON PROTEIN LAYER</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present an atomistic model for the outermost layer of the hair surface derived through molecular dynamics simulations, which comprises 18&#8208;Methyleicosanoic acid (18&#8208;MEA) fatty acid chains covalently bonded onto the keratin&#8208;associated protein 10&#8208;4 (KAP10&#8208;4) at a spacing distance of ~ 1 nm. Remarkably, this surface model facilitates the inclusion of free fatty acids (free 18&#8208;MEA) into the gaps between chemically bound 18&#8208;MEA chains, up to a maximum number that results in a packing density of 0.22 nm2 per fatty acid molecule, consistent with the optimal spacing identified through free energy analysis. Atomistic insights are provided into the organization of fatty acid chains, structural features, and interaction energies on protein&#8208;inclusive hair surface models with varying amounts of free 18&#8208;MEA (FMEA) depletion, as well as varying degrees of anionic cysteic acid from damaged bound 18&#8208;MEA (BMEA), under both dry and wet conditions. Our simulation results reveal that, while the depletion of FMEA can induce a pronounced impact on the thickness, tilt angle, and order parameters of fatty acid chains , the removal of BMEA has a marked effect on water penetration. There is a &#8220;sweet spot&#8221; spacing between the 18&#8208;MEA whereby damaged hair surface properties can be reinstated by&#160; replenishing FMEA.</dc:description>

         <title>Profiling Cellular Morphological Changes Induced by Dual&#8208;targeting PROTACs of Aurora Kinase and RNA&#8208;binding Protein&#160;YTHDF2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are new chemical modalities that degrade proteins of interest, including established kinase targets and emerging RNA&#8208;binding proteins (RBPs). Whereas diverse sets of biochemical, biophysical and cellular assays are available for the evaluation and optimizations of PROTACs in understanding the involved ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome&#8208;mediated degradation mechanism and the structure&#8208;degradation relationship, a phenotypic method profiling the cellular morphological changes is rarely used. In this study, first, we reported the only examples of PROTACs degrading the mRNA&#8208;binding protein YTHDF2 via screening of multikinase PROTACs. Second, we reported the profiling of cellular morphological changes of the dual kinase&#8208; and RBP&#8208;targeting PROTACs using the unbiased cell painting assay (CPA). The CPA analysis revealed the high biosimilarity with the established aurora kinase cluster and annotated aurora kinase inhibitors, which reflected the association between YTHDF2 and the aurora kinase signaling network. Broadly, the results demonstrated that the cell painting assay can be a straightforward and powerful approach to evaluate PROTACs. Complementary to the existing biochemical, biophysical and cellular assays, CPA provided a new perspective in characterizing PROTACs at the cellular morphology.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Reviewing computational methods for Enzyme Engineering in the era of Machine Learning: A concise overview of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods, ranging from property engineering to the de novo design of enzymes, with an emphasis on user&#8208;friendly tools that are freely accessible as web&#8208;interfaces.







Abstract
Enzyme engineering, though pivotal across various biotechnological domains, is often plagued by its time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive nature. This review aims to offer an overview of supportive in silico methodologies for this demanding endeavor. Starting from methods to predict protein structures, to classification of their activity and even the discovery of new enzymes we continue with describing tools used to increase thermostability and production yields of selected targets. Subsequently, we discuss computational methods to modulate both, the activity as well as selectivity of enzymes. Last, we present recent approaches based on cutting&#8208;edge machine learning methods to redesign enzymes. With exception of the last chapter, there is a strong focus on methods easily accessible via web&#8208;interfaces or simple Python&#8208;scripts, therefore readily useable for a diverse and broad community.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Catalytic Activity of Protein Containing Thiotyrosine as an Active Site Residue</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;canonical amino acid thiotyrosine was incorporated into a small cyclic protein by chemical synthesis. Thanks to the aryl&#8208;thiol containing side chain, it is able to serve as a catalyst for ester hydrolysis and native chemical ligation of peptides.







Abstract
Native chemical ligation is a key reaction in the toolbox of chemical methods for the synthesis of native and modified proteins. The catalysis of ligation is commonly performed by using small aryl&#8208;thiol molecules added at high concentrations. In this work, we incorporated thiotyrosine, a non&#8208;canonical amino acid containing an aryl&#8208;thiol moiety, into a designed cyclic protein &#171; sans queue ni t&#234;te &#187;. Importantly, the protein environment reduced the pKa of the thiol group to 5.8&#8211;5.9, which is significantly lower than the previously reported value for thiotyrosine in a short peptide (pKa 6.4). Furthermore, we demonstrated the catalytic activity of this protein both as hydrolase and in native chemical ligation of peptides. These results will be useful for the development of efficient protein catalysts (enzymes) for protein synthesis and modification.

         <title>Genetically Encoded Photocaged Proteinogenic and Non&#8208;Proteinogenic Amino Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocaged amino acids could be genetically encoded into proteins via genetic code expansion (GCE) and constitute unique tools for innovative protein engineering. There are a number of photocaged proteinogenic amino acids that allow strategic conversion of proteins into their photocaged variants, thus enabling spatiotemporal and non&#8208;invasive regulation of protein functions using light. Meanwhile, there are a hand of photocaged non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids that address the challenges in directly encoding certain non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) that structurally resemble proteinogenic ones or possess highly reactive functional groups. Herein, we would like to summarize the efforts in encoding photocaged proteinogenic and non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids, hoping to draw more attention to this fruitful and exciting scientific campaign.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Developments in the Biosynthesis of Aziridines</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Only 0.016% of all known natural products contain an aziridine ring, but this unique structural feature imparts high reactivity and cytotoxicity to the compounds in which it is found. Until 2021, no naturally occurring azirdine&#8208;forming enzymes had been identified. Since 2021, the biosynthetic enzymes for ~10% of known aziridine containing natural products have been identified and characterized. This article describes the recent advances in our understanding of enzyme&#8208;catalyzed aziridine formation in the context of historical means of azirdine formation through synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Orthosteric and Allosteric Pharmacological Chaperones for Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB (MPS IIIB) is an autosomal inherited disease caused by mutations in gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;alpha&#8208;glucosaminidase (NAGLU). These mutations result in reduced NAGLU activity, preventing it from catalyzing the hydrolysis of the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate (HS). There are currently no approved treatments for MPS IIIB. A novel approach in the treatment of lysosomal storage diseases is the use of pharmacological chaperones (PC). In this study, we used a drug repurposing approach to identify and characterize novel potential PCs for NAGLU enzyme. We modeled the interaction of natural and artificial substrates within the active cavity of NAGLU (orthosteric site) and predicted potential allosteric sites. We performed a virtual screening for both the orthosteric and the predicted allosteric site against a curated database of human tested molecules. Considering the binding affinity and predicted blood&#8208;brain barrier permeability and gastrointestinal absorption, we selected atovaquone and piperaquine as orthosteric and allosteric PCs. The PCs were evaluated by their capacity to bind NAGLU and the ability to restore the enzymatic activity in human MPS IIIB fibroblasts These results represent novel PCs described for MPS IIIB and demonstrate the potential to develop novel therapeutic alternatives for this and other protein deficiency diseases</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing External Irradiation for Precise Activation of Metal&#8208;Based Agents in Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer is a significant global health issue. Platinum&#8208;based chemotherapy drugs, including cisplatin, are crucial in clinical anti&#8208;cancer treatment. However, these drugs have limitations such as drug resistance, non&#8208;specific distribution, and irreversible toxic and side effects. In recent years, the development of metal&#8208;based agents has led to the discovery of other anti&#8208;cancer effects beyond chemotherapy. Precise spatiotemporal controlled external irradiation can activate metal&#8208;based agents at specific sites and play a different role from traditional chemotherapy. These strategies can not only enhance the anti&#8208;cancer efficiency, but also show fewer side effects and non&#8208;cross&#8208;drug resistance, which are ideal approaches to solve the problems caused by traditional platinum&#8208;based chemotherapy drugs. In this review, we focus onvarious metal&#8208;based agent&#8208;mediated cancer therapies that are activated by three types of external irradiation: near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light, ultrasound (US), and X&#8208;ray, and give some prospects. We hope that this review will promote the generation of new kinds of metal&#8208;based anti&#8208;cancer agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Heavy Metal Detection with Organic Moiety&#8208;Based Sensors: Recent Advances and Future Directions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heavy metal hazardous and enduring characteristics present a noteworthy risk to both human well&#8208;being and the ecosystem. Heavy metal level monitoring requires accurate and dependable detection techniques. This review emphasizes the requirement for sophisticated detection methods that can address the issues like sensitivity, selectivity, accuracy cost, ease of use of heavy metal ion and allow for more accurate and trustworthy monitoring using organic moiety. It offers a thorough overview of cutting&#8208;edge organic moiety&#8208;based heavy metal detection technique. It primarily discusses four different types of substituted core structures, including coumarin, porphyrin, Schiff bases, and terpyridine, along with their mechanisms, methods, detection limits, and appropriate metal bindings. These moieties exhibit strong coordination with heavy metal ions because of their distinct structural characteristics. They produce stable complexes with complicated ligand&#8208;metal interactions that are useful in a variety of applications, including sensing and catalysis. Each probe was chosen based on its propensity or capacity to identify important analytes in practical applications. To increase the effectiveness and productivity of fluorescence sensing, researchers have recently been working to create new fluorescence chemosensors that can identify many ions at once.</dc:description>

         <title>Imidazoles are tunable nucleofuges for developing tyrosine&#8208;reactive electrophiles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imidazole&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonyl and &#8208;sulfonate (imidazylate) are widely used in synthetic chemistry as nucleofuges for diazotransfer, nucleophilic substitution, and cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The utility of these reagents for protein bioconjugation, in contrast, have not been comprehensively explored and important considering the prevalence of imidazoles in biomolecules and drugs. Here, we synthesized a series of alkyne&#8208;modified sulfonyl&#8208; and sulfonate&#8208;imidazole probes to investigate the utility of this electrophile for protein binding. Alkylation of the distal nitrogen activated the nucleofuge capability of the imidazole to produce sulfonyl&#8208;imidazolium electrophiles that were highly reactive but unstable for biological applications. In contrast, arylsulfonyl imidazoles functioned as a tempered electrophile for assessing ligandability of select tyrosine and lysine sites in cell proteomes and when mated to a recognition element could produce targeted covalent inhibitors with reduced off&#8208;target activity. In summary, imidazole nucleofuges show balanced stability and tunability to produce sulfone&#8208;based electrophiles that bind functional tyrosine and lysine sites in the proteome.</dc:description>

         <title>Sunflower Pollen&#8208;Derived Microspheres Selectively Absorb DNA for microRNA Detection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the finding that a naturally sunflower pollen&#8208;derived microspheres (HSECs) with hierarchical structures can selectively absorb polyC and polyA with high efficiency and affinity. HSECs exhibit the capability to selectively absorb polyC and polyA ssDNA under neutral and acidic conditions. It has been observed that the presence of metal cations, specifically Ca2+, enhances the absorption efficiency of HSECs. Mechanically, this absorption phenomenon can be attributed to both electrostatic interactions and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions. Such an appealing property enables the functionalization of HSECs for broad potential biomedical applications, such as microRNA detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Programmed Self&#8208;Assembly of Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoparticles are a hot topic in the field of nanomaterial research due to their excellent physical and chemical properties. In recent years, DNA&#8208;directed nanoparticle self&#8208;assembly technology has been widely applied to the development of numerous complex nanoparticle superstructures. Due to the inherent stability and surface electric repulsion of nanoparticles, it is difficult to make nanoparticle superstructures respond to molecular signals in the external environment. In fact, enzyme&#8208;programmed molecular systems are developed to allow diverse functions, including logical operations, signal amplification, and dynamic assembly control. Therefore, combining enzyme&#8208;controlled DNA systems may endow nanoparticle assembly systems with more flexibility in program design, allowing them to respond to a variety of external signals. In this review, we summarize the basic principles of enzyme&#8208;controlled DNA/nanoparticle self&#8208;assembly and introduce its applications in heavy metal detection, gene expression, proteins inside living cells, cancer cell therapy, and drug delivery. With the continuous development of new nanoparticle materials and the increasing functionality of enzyme DNA circuits, enzyme&#8208;directed DNA/nanoparticle self&#8208;assembled probe technology is expected to see significant future development.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances in Polymeric Nanomaterial&#8208;mediated Autophagy for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Autophagy is an important biological mechanism for eukaryotic cells to regulate growth, death, and energy metabolism, and plays an important role in removing damaged organelles, misfolded or aggregated proteins, and clearing pathogens. It has been found that autophagy is closely related to cell survival and death, and is of great significance in cancerigenesis and development, playing a bidirectional role in cancer inhibition and cancer promotion. Therefore, treating cancers by regulating autophagy has attracted much attention. A large amount of research evidence indicates that polymeric nanomaterials are able to regulate cellular autophagy, and their good biocompatibility, degradability, and functionalizable modification open up a broad application prospect for improving the therapeutic effect of cancers. This review provides an overview of the research progress of polymeric nanomaterials for modulating autophagy in the treatment of cancers.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of RNA Modified with Thioamide Internucleoside Linkage</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent success of RNA therapeutics has reinvigorated interest in chemical modifications of RNA. As exemplified by the phosphorothioates, modifications of sugar&#8208;phosphate backbone have been remarkably impactful but relatively underexplored in therapeutic RNAs. The present study reports synthesis, thermal stability, and RNA interference activity of RNAs modified with thioamide linkages. Compared to the previously studied amide&#8208;modified RNA, thioamide linkages strongly destabilized a short self&#8208;complementary RNA model duplex. However, in short interfering RNAs amides and thioamides had a similar effect on duplex stability and target RNA cleavage activity and specificity. Hence, the thioamide may be added to the toolbox of chemical biologist as a useful backbone modification well tolerated by the RNA interference machinery.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the available RNA labeling toolbox with CutA nucleotidyltransferase for efficient transcript labeling with purine and pyrimidine nucleotide analogs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RNA labeling is an invaluable tool for investigation of the function and localization of nucleic acids. Labels are commonly incorporated into 3&#8242; end of RNA and the primary enzyme used for this purpose is RNA poly(A) polymerase (PAP), which belongs to the class of terminal nucleotidyltransferases (NTases). However, PAP preferentially adds ATP analogs, thus limiting the number of available substrates. Here, we report the use of another NTase, CutA from the fungus Thielavia terrestris. Using this enzyme, we were able to incorporate into the 3&#8242; end of RNA not only purine analogs, but also pyrimidine analogs. We engaged strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyl cycloaddition (SPAAC) to obtain fluorescently labeled or biotinylated transcripts from RNAs extended with azide analogs by CutA. Importantly, modified transcripts retained their biological properties. Furthermore, fluorescently labeled mRNAs were suitable for visualization in cultured mammalian cells. Finally, we demonstrate that either affinity studies or molecular dynamic (MD) simulations allow for rapid screening of NTase substrates, what opens up new avenues in the search for the optimal substrates for this class of enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Proteomic Profiling of Antimalarial Plasmodione Using 3&#8208;Benz(o)ylmenadione Affinity&#8208;Based Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe here the design, synthesis and evaluation of an antiplasmodial 3&#8208;benzyl&#8208;6&#8208;fluoro&#8208;menadione probe for affinity&#8208;based protein profiling experiments using yeast and P. falciparum parasite lysates. These studies allowed us to identify a first list of proteins interacting with plasmodione in both yeast and P. falciparum late trophozoites.







Abstract
Understanding the mechanisms of drug action in malarial parasites is crucial for the development of new drugs to combat infection and to counteract drug resistance. Proteomics is a widely used approach to study host&#8208;pathogen systems and to identify drug protein targets. Plasmodione is an antiplasmodial early&#8208;lead drug exerting potent activities against young asexual and sexual blood stages in&#8197;vitro with low toxicity to host cells. To elucidate its molecular mechanisms, an affinity&#8208;based protein profiling (AfBPP) approach was applied to yeast and P. falciparum proteomes. New (pro&#8208;) AfBPP probes based on the 3&#8208;benz(o)yl&#8208;6&#8208;fluoro&#8208;menadione scaffold were synthesized. With optimized conditions of both photoaffinity labeling and click reaction steps, the AfBPP protocol was then applied to a yeast proteome, yielding 11 putative drug&#8208;protein targets. Among these, we found four proteins associated with oxidoreductase activities, the hypothesized type of targets for plasmodione and its metabolites, and other proteins associated with the mitochondria. In Plasmodium parasites, the MS analysis revealed 44 potential plasmodione targets that need to be validated in further studies. Finally, the localization of a 3&#8208;benzyl&#8208;6&#8208;fluoromenadione AfBPP probe was studied in the subcellular structures of the parasite at the trophozoite stage.

         <title>Engineering the Substrate Specificity of (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Phenylalanine Adenylation Enzyme HitB</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adenylation enzymes catalyze the selective incorporation of aminoacyl building blocks in the biosynthesis of nonribosomal peptides and related natural products. Although &#946;&#8208;amino acid units are one of the important aminoacyl building blocks in natural product biosynthesis, very little is known about the engineering of &#946;&#8208;amino acid adenylation enzymes. In this study, we engineered the substrate specificity of the (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;phenylalanine adenylation enzyme, HitB, involved in the biosynthesis of macrolactam polyketide hitachimycin. Based on the previously determined structure of HitB wild&#8208;type, we mutated Phe328 and Ser293, which are located near the meta and ortho position of the (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;phenylalanine moiety, respectively. As a result, the HitB F328V and F328L mutants efficiently activated meta&#8208;substituted (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;phenylalanine analogs, and the HitB T293G and T293S mutants efficiently activated ortho&#8208;substituted (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;phenylalanine analogs. Structural analysis of the HitB F328L and T293G mutants with the corresponding nonhydrolyzable intermediate analogs revealed an enlarged substrate binding pocket for (S)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;phenylalanine analogs, providing detailed insights into the structural basis for creating enzyme substrate promiscuity. Our findings may be useful for production of various &#946;&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing natural product analogs.</dc:description>

As a result, the HitB F328V and F328L mutants efficiently activated meta-substituted (S)-&#946;-phenylalanine analogs, and the HitB T293G and T293S mutants efficiently activated ortho-substituted (S)-&#946;-phenylalanine analogs. Structural analysis of the HitB F328L and T293G mutants with the corresponding nonhydrolyzable intermediate analogs revealed an enlarged substrate binding pocket for (S)-&#946;-phenylalanine analogs, providing detailed insights into the structural basis for creating enzyme substrate promiscuity. Our findings may be useful for production of various &#946;-amino acid-containing natural product analogs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>IKZF2 Degradation: It's Time to Take into Account it When Designing Cereblon&#8208;based PROTACs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC) has become a very important means of protein degradation and a new way of disease treatment. In particular, PROTACs constructed with ligands for E3 ligase cereblon account for more than 90% of the PROTACs currently in clinical research. Notably, CRBN ligands themselves are a class of molecular glue compounds capable of degrading neo&#8208;substrate proteins. Compared to the target proteins degradation, the degradation of neo&#8208;substrates, especially IKZF2, has not received enough attention. Therefore, this review summarizes the currently published IKZF2 degraders derived from articles and patents, which are conducive to the design of PROTACs with desired IKZF2 degradation from the perspective of medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Developing Covalent Organic Framework&#160;Biocatalysts through Enzyme Encapsulation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as porous supports to encapsulate enzyme represents an advanced strategy for constructing COFs biocatalysts, which has inspired numerous interests across various applications. As the structural advantages including ultrastable covalent&#8208;bonded linkage, tailorable pore structure, and metal&#8208;free biocompatibility, the resultant enzyme&#8208;COFs biocatalysts showcase functional enhancement in catalytic activity, chemical stability, long&#8208;term durability, and recyclability. This Concept describes the recent advances in the methodological strategies for engineering the COFs biocatalysts, with specific emphasis on the pore entrapment and in situ encapsulation strategies. The structural advantages of the COFs hybrid biocatalysts for organic synthesis, environment&#8208; and energy&#8208;associated applications are also canvassed. Additionally, the remaining challenges and the forward&#8208;looking directions in this field are also discussed. We believe that this Concept can offer useful methodological guidance for developing active and robust COFs biocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication of Nanocatalytic Medicine from Self&#8208;Assembling Peptides Containing an ATCUN&#8208;like Copper&#8208;Binding Motif for Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of nanomaterials with multiple enzymatic activities via a facile approach receives growing interests in recent years. Although peptide self&#8208;assembling provides an effective approach for the construction of biomimetic materials in recent years, fabrication of artificial enzymes from self&#8208;assembling peptides with multiple catalytic activities for anticancer therapy is still a challenge. Here, we report a simple method to prepare nanocatalysts with multienzyme&#8208;like activities from self&#8208;assembling peptides containing ATCUN copper&#8208;binding motifs. With the aid of the coordination interactions between the ATCUN motif and Cu(II) ions, these peptides could perform supramolecular self&#8208;assembly to form nanomaterials with biomimetic peroxidase, ascorbate oxidase and glutathione peroxidase activities. Moreover, these trienzyme&#8208;like effects can elevate oxidative stress levels and suppress the antioxidative capability of cancer cells, which synergistically induce the apoptosis of cancer cells. Because of the high biocompatibility, catalytic activities and drug encapsulation properties, this self&#8208;assembled peptide provides a biomimetic platform for the development of new nanocatalytic medicines for multimodal synergistic cancer therapies.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleic acids exhibit exceptional functionalities for both molecular recognition and catalysis, along with the capability of predictable assembly through strand displacement reactions. The inherent programmability and addressability of DNA probes enable their precise, on&#8208;demand assembly and accurate execution of hybridization, significantly enhancing target detection capabilities. Decades of research in DNA nanotechnology have led to advances in the structural design of functional DNA probes, resulting in increasingly sensitive and robust DNA sensors. Moreover, increasing attention has been devoted to enhancing the accuracy and sensitivity of DNA&#8208;based biosensors by integrating multiple sensing procedures. In this review, we summarize various strategies aimed at enhancing the accuracy of DNA sensors. These strategies involve multiple guarantee procedures, utilizing dual signal output mechanisms, and implementing sequential regulation methods. Our goal is to provide new insights into the development of more accurate DNA sensors, ultimately facilitating their widespread application in clinical diagnostics and assessment.</dc:description>

         <title>Using F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to Understand the Ubiquitination Landscape</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a critical and detailed analysis for the use of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) as a tool to study protein ubiquitination. Topics include the unique approaches where FRET is used to quantify the transfer of ubiquitin through the E1, E2 and E3 enzymes of the ubiquitination cascade, the removal of ubiquitin by deubiquitinating enzymes and the processing of ubiquitin&#8208;labelled proteins by the 26S&#8197;proteasome. FRET methods have enabled protein interactions, conformational changes and dynamics of the ubiquitination pathway to be measured that can be adapted to several high&#8208;throughput technologies and on the single molecule level.







Abstract
F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a fluorescence technique that allows quantitative measurement of protein interactions, kinetics and dynamics. This review covers the use of FRET to study the structures and mechanisms of ubiquitination and related proteins. We survey FRET assays that have been developed where donor and acceptor fluorophores are placed on E1, E2 or E3 enzymes and ubiquitin (Ub) to monitor steady&#8208;state and real&#8208;time transfer of Ub through the ubiquitination cascade. Specialized FRET probes placed on Ub and Ub&#8208;like proteins have been developed to monitor Ub removal by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) that result in a loss of a FRET signal upon cleavage of the FRET probes. FRET has also been used to understand conformational changes in large complexes such as multimeric E3 ligases and the proteasome, frequently using sophisticated single molecule methods. Overall, FRET is a powerful tool to help unravel the intricacies of the complex ubiquitination system.

         <title>Kinetic ITC of DNA Aptamers Binding for Small Molecules and Implications for Binding Assays and Biosensors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The determination of kon and koff values through kinetic analysis is crucial for understanding the intricacies of aptamer&#8208;target binding interactions. By employing kinetic ITC, we systematically analyzed a range of ITC data for various aptamers. Upon plotting their kon and koff values as a function of their Kd values, a notable trend emerged. Across a range of Kd values spanning from 28 nM to 864 &#181;M, the kon value decreased from 2&#180;105 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1 to 96 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1, whereas the koff value increased from 1.03&#180;10&#8208;3 s&#8208;1 to 0.012 s&#8208;1. Thus, both kon and koff contributed to the change of Kd in the same direction, although the range of kon change was larger. Since experiments are often run at close to the Kd value, this concentration effect also played an important role in the observed binding kinetics. The effect of these kinetic parameters on two common sensing mechanisms, including aptamer beacons and strand&#8208;displacement assays, are discussed. This work has provided the kinetic values of small molecule binding aptamers and provided insights into aptamer&#8208;based biosensors.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) are valuable biocatalysts for the oxyfunctionalization of non&#8208;activated carbon&#8208;hydrogen bonds. Most CYPs rely on electron transport proteins as redox partners. In this study, the ferredoxin reductase (FdR) and ferredoxin (FD) for a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase from Acinetobacter&#160;sp.&#160;OC4 are investigated. Upon heterologous production of both proteins independently in Escherichia&#160;coli, spectral analysis showed their reduction capability towards reporter electron acceptors, e.g., cytochrome c. The individual proteins&#8217; specific activity towards cytochrome c reduction was 25 U&#160;mg&#8209;1. Furthermore, the possibility to enhance electron transfer by artificial fusion of the units was elucidated. FdR and FD were linked by helical linkers [EAAAK]n, flexible glycine linkers [GGGGS]n or rigid proline linkers [EPPPP]n of n&#160;=&#160;1&#160;&#8211;&#160;4 sequence repetitions. The system with a glycine linker (n&#160;=&#160;4) reached an appreciable specific activity of 19&#160;U&#160;mg&#8209;1 towards cytochrome c. Moreover, their ability to drive different members of the CYP153A subfamily is demonstrated. By creating artificial self&#8208;sufficient P450s with FdR, FD, and a panel of four CYP153A representatives, effective hydroxylation of n&#8208;hexane in a whole&#8208;cell system was achieved. The results indicate this protein combination to constitute a functional and versatile surrogate electron transport system for this subfamily.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;cell Catalysis by Tethered Organo&#8208;Osmium Complexes Generates Selectivity for Breast Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anticancer agents that exhibit catalytic mechanisms of action offer a unique multi&#8208;targeting strategy to overcome drug resistance. Nonetheless, many in&#8208;cell catalysts in development are hindered by deactivation by endogenous nucleophiles. We have synthesised a highly potent, stable Os&#8208;based 16&#8208;electron half&#8208;sandwich (&#8216;piano stool&#8217;) catalyst by introducing a permanent covalent tether between the arene and chelated diamine ligand. This catalyst exhibits antiproliferative activity comparable to the clinical drug cisplatin towards triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cells and can overcome tamoxifen resistance. Speciation experiments revealed Os to be almost exclusively albumin&#8208;bound in the extracellular medium, while cellular accumulation studies identified an energy&#8208;dependent, protein&#8208;mediated Os accumulation pathway, consistent with albumin&#8208;mediated uptake. Importantly, the tethered Os complex was active for in&#8208;cell transfer hydrogenation catalysis, initiated by co&#8208;administration of a non&#8208;toxic dose of sodium formate as a source of hydride, indicating that the Os catalyst is delivered to the cytosol of cancer cells intact. The mechanism of action involves the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus exploiting the inherent redox vulnerability of cancer cells, accompanied by selectivity for cancerous cells over non&#8208;tumorigenic cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploration of Rhenium Bisquinoline Tricarbonyl Complexes for their Antibacterial Properties</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal complexes have emerged as a promising source for novel classes of antibacterial agents to combat the rise of antimicrobial resistance around the world. In the exploration of the transition metal chemical space for novel metalloantibiotics, the rhenium tricarbonyl moiety has been identified as a promising scaffold. Here we have prepared eight novel rhenium bisquinoline tricarbonyl complexes and explored their antibacterial properties. Significant activity against both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria was observed. However, all complexes also showed significant toxicity against human cells, putting into question the prospects of this specific rhenium compound class as metalloantibiotics. To better understand their biological effects, we conduct the first mode of action studies on rhenium bisquinoline complexes and show that they are able to form pores through bacterial membranes. Their straight&#8208;forward synthesis and tuneability suggests that further optimisation of this compound class could lead to compounds with enhanced bacterial specificity.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Multi&#8208;enzyme Integrated Catalysts for Deracemization of Cyclic Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;enzyme cascade catalysis has become an important technique for chemical reactions used in manufacturing and scientific study. In this research, we designed a four&#8208;enzyme integrated catalyst and used it to catalyse the racemization reaction of cyclic chiral amines, where monoamine oxidase (MAO) catalyses the selective oxidation of 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinoline (MTQ), imine reductase (IRED) catalyses the selective reduction of 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroisoquinoline (MDQ), formate dehydrogenase (FDH) is used for the cyclic regeneration of cofactors, and catalase (CAT) is used for decomposition of oxidative reactions. The four enzymes were immobilized via polydopamine (PDA)&#8208;encapsulated dendritic organosilica nanoparticles (DONs) as carriers, resulting in the amphiphilic core&#8208;shell catalysts. The hydrophilic PDA shell ensures the dispersion of the catalyst in water, and the hydrophobic DON core creates a microenvironment with the spatial confinement effect of the organic substrate and the preconcentration effect to enhance the stability of the enzymes and the catalytic efficiency. The core&#8208;shell structure improves the stability and reusability of the catalyst and rationally arranges the position of different enzymes according to the reaction sequence to improve the cascade catalytic performance and cofactor recovery efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystallization Assisted Dynamic Kinetic Resolution for the Synthesis of (R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Methylphenethylamine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of enzymatic synthesis with in&#8197;situ product crystallization (ISPC) is used to convert 2&#8208;phenylpropanal to (R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methylphenethylamine. Product concentrations of up to 250&#8197;mM and enantiomeric excesses of up to 99&#8201;% are reached in a DKR&#8208;based reaction. The source of substrate decomposition during the reaction is investigated and the byproduct formation is reduced to insignificant levels.







Abstract
This study explores a combination of the concept of enantioselective enzymatic synthesis of &#946;&#8208;chiral amines through transamination with in&#8197;situ product crystallization (ISPC) to overcome product inhibition. Using 2&#8208;phenylpropanal as a readily available and easily racemizing substrate of choice, (R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methylphenethylamine ((R)&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropan&#8208;1&#8208;amine) concentrations of up to 250&#8197;mM and enantiomeric excesses of up to 99&#8201;% are achieved when using a commercially available transaminase from Ruegeria pomeroyi in a fed&#8208;batch based dynamic kinetic resolution reaction on preparative scale. The source of substrate decomposition during the reaction is also investigated and the resulting unwanted byproduct formation is successfully reduced to insignificant levels.

         <title>Detoxification of V&#8208;Nerve Agents Assisted by a Microperoxidase: New Pathway Revealed by the Use of a Relevant VX Simulant</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biocatalyzed oxidative detoxification of the V&#8208;series simulant PhX with the microperoxidase AcMP11 affords the corresponding phosphonothioate as the prominent product instead of the classical P&#8722;S and P&#8722;O bond cleavage. These results highlight the efficacy of AcMP11 to efficiently detoxify V&#8208;series organophosphorus nerve agents and the necessity to use relevant simulants, such as PhX, to prevent false positive/negative results.







Abstract
The biocatalyzed oxidative detoxification of the V&#8208;series simulant PhX, by mean of the microperoxidase AcMP11, affords the corresponding phosphonothioate as the prominent product instead of the classical P&#8722;S and P&#8722;O bond cleavage. While PhX is structurally very close to the live agent VX (the methyl group is replaced by a phenyl), assessment with other surrogates missing the nucleophilic amino function displayed more resistance under the same conditions with no phosphonothioate observed. These encouraging results highlight 1) the efficacy of AcMP11 microperoxidase to efficiently detoxify V&#8208;series organophosphorus nerve agents (OPNA), and 2) the necessity to use representative alkyl or aryl phosphonothioates simulants such as PhX bearing the appropriate side chain as well as the P&#8722;O and P&#8722;S cleavable bond to mimic accurately the V&#8208;series OPNA to prevent false positive or false negative results.

         <title>A Quantitative Method to Distinguish Cytosolic from Endosome&#8208;Trapped Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) fluorescence protocol to determine the quantity of a cell&#8208;penetrating peptide internalized at 37&#8201;&#176;C either by direct translocation across the cell membrane or endocytosis. The protocol can be used with any cell type and only requires (DABCYL) 4&#8208;(dimethylaminoazo)benzene&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid&#8208; and (CF) carboxyfluorescein&#8208;labeled peptides. Its application to tetra&#8208; and hexaarginines highlights their difference of internalization.







Abstract
Cell&#8208;penetrating peptides are known to penetrate cells through endocytosis and translocation. The two pathways are hardly distinguished in current cell assays. We developed a reliable, simple and robust method to distinguish and quantify independently the two routes. The assay requires (DABCYL) 4&#8208;(dimethylaminoazo)benzene&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid&#8208; and (CF) carboxyfluorescein&#8208;labeled peptides. When the labeled peptide is intact, the fluorescence signal is weak thanks to the dark quenching property of DABCYL. A 10&#8208;fold higher fluorescence signal is measured when the labeled peptide is degraded. By referring to a standard fluorescent curve according to the concentration of the hydrolyzed peptide, we have access to the internalized peptide quantity. Therefore, cell lysis after internalization permits to determine the total quantity of intracellular peptide. The molecular state of the internalized peptide (intact or degraded), depends on its location in cells (cytosol vs endo&#8208;lysosomes), and can be blocked by boiling cells. This boiling step results indeed in denaturation and inhibition of the cellular enzymes. The advantage of this method is the possibility to quantify translocation at 37&#8201;&#176;C and to compare it to the 4&#8201;&#176;C condition, where all endocytosis processes are inhibited. We found that ranking of the translocation efficacy is DABCYL&#8208;R6&#8208;(&#1013;CF)K&#8811;DABCYL&#8208;R4&#8208;(&#1013;CF)K&#8805;CF&#8208;R9.

&lt;p&gt;This study reports a F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) fluorescence protocol to determine the quantity of a cell-penetrating peptide internalized at 37&#8201;&#176;C either by direct translocation across the cell membrane or endocytosis. The protocol can be used with any cell type and only requires (DABCYL) 4-(dimethylaminoazo)benzene-4-carboxylic acid- and (CF) carboxyfluorescein-labeled peptides. Its application to tetra- and hexaarginines highlights their difference of internalization.

         <title>The Development and Opportunities of Predictive Biotechnology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concept study on predictive biotechnology, which can be employed to map and optimize biological systems and processes through to technological implementation. A new tool for the resource&#8208;saving (future) development of biotechnological processes.







Abstract
Recent advances in bioeconomy allow a holistic view of existing and new process chains and enable novel production routines continuously advanced by academia and industry. All this progress benefits from a growing number of prediction tools that have found their way into the field. For example, automated genome annotations, tools for building model structures of proteins, and structural protein prediction methods such as AlphaFold2TM or RoseTTAFold have gained popularity in recent years. Recently, it has become apparent that more and more AI&#8208;based tools are being developed and used for biocatalysis and biotechnology. This is an excellent opportunity for academia and industry to accelerate advancements in the field further. Biotechnology, as a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field, stands to benefit greatly from these developments.
