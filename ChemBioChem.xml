         <title>Investigation on the Peroxidase&#8208;Like Activity of Co3O4 Nanoparticles Adsorbed with Diverse DNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the regulatory effect of diverse DNA on the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of Co3O4 NPs was investigated for the first time, offering a novel perspective for the application of Co3O4 NPs in photometric detection.

In recent years, nanozymes have increasingly attracted the attention of researchers due to their low cost, high stability, and straightforward preparation when compared with natural enzymes. Furthermore, the biocompatibility of nanozymes has been enhanced through surface adsorption, hence broadening their application scope. In this work, Co3O4 nanozyme was adsorbed with diverse DNA, and the catalytic performance was significantly boosted compared with the pure Co3O4 nanozyme. Peroxidase&#8208;like activity assays revealed three key findings. First, the adsorption of single&#8208;stranded DNA proved to be more effective than that of double&#8208;stranded DNA. Second, the 50&#8208;nucleotide single&#8208;stranded DNA sequence yielded the stronger catalytic signal. Ultimately, guanine rich nucleotide exhibited the higher catalytic efficiency in single&#8208;stranded DNA and cytosine&#8208;guanine rich nucleotide exhibited the stronger catalytic efficiency in double&#8208;stranded DNA. The kinetic results of its catalytic activity showed that the catalysis of the adsorbed Co3O4 nanozyme followed the Michaelis&#8211;Menten kinetics. In parallel, the Km value of 50&#8208;nucleotide single&#8208;stranded DNA adsorption was the lowest of diverse DNA, which was 6.11&#8201;mM and 54.8% of the pure Co3O4 nanozyme. These findings establish DNA adsorption as an effective strategy for enhancing the catalytic activity of Co3O4 nanozymes, presenting significant potential for applications in medical diagnostics and antioxidant&#8208;related fields.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Rational Design of a Selective Hydrolase Inhibitor of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus&#8208;2 Nsp3 Macrodomain</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;guided design of a sulfamoyl&#8208;modified analog of GS&#8208;441524 yielded a selective, high&#8208;affinity inhibitor of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 macrodomain Nsp3b. The compound occupies the phosphate&#8208;binding pocket, forming a stabilizing hydrogen&#8208;bond network that enhances binding affinity (K_D&#8201;=&#8201;0.86&#8201;&#956;M). This study establishes sulfamoyl substitution as an effective phosphate bioisostere for rational antiviral macrodomain inhibitor design.

Viral macrodomains, which hydrolyze mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated proteins to evade host immunity, represent emerging antiviral targets, yet their druggability remains underexplored. GS&#8208;441524, the active metabolite of remdesivir, has been identified as an inhibitor of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) macrodomain (Nsp3b). Herein, the structure&#8211;activity relationship governing macrodomain recognition by the ribosylated moiety using a panel of nucleoside analogs, revealing that phosphate configuration and nucleobase identity critically modulate binding affinity. GS&#8208;441524 derivatives exhibit up to 200&#8208;fold higher affinity compared to adenosine&#8208;based ligands. A novel sulfamoyl derivative demonstrates superior inhibitory potency, attributable to its occupation of the phosphate subsite and formation of a stabilizing hydrogen&#8208;bond network. These findings provide molecular insights into Nsp3b&#8211;ligand interactions and establish a rational framework for the development of high&#8208;affinity, structure&#8208;guided inhibitors targeting viral macrodomains.

         <title>Regulation of Supramolecular Interactions: RNA:DNA Folding and Nanopore Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Urea regulates the folding of RNA:DNA hybrids through supramolecular interactions, enhances their structural rigidity, and reduces folding events during nanopore translocation. This significantly improves the signal distinguishability and decoding efficiency for the detection of low&#8208;abundance RNA at the single&#8208;molecule level, providing a novel technical approach for the accurate detection of pathogenic RNA and the analysis of drug metabolism.

The intersection of DNA/RNA nanotechnology and single&#8208;molecule solid&#8208;state nanopore sensing enables precise detection of low&#8208;abundance biomolecules. However, a significant challenge persists that nucleic acid molecules readily fold during nanopore translocation, which gives rise to ambiguous current signatures, reduces the number of usable data points, and compromises detection accuracy. Herein, a recent advancement by the Platnich group is highlighted, wherein urea is employed as a noncovalent modulator to participate in the isothermal assembly of MS2 bacteriophage RNA with DNA barcodes. This modulator stably binds to the RNA:DNA hybrids through supramolecular interactions after removal of free urea by buffer exchange. Nanopore assays showed a &#8776;50% reduction in fold&#8208;shift events in the urea&#8208;treated group. Atomic force microscopy characterization shows that the persistence length of the hybrids is enhanced by &#8776;40%. This strategy provides a new noncovalent regulatory tool for nucleic acid nanotechnology and pushes the nanopore sensing technology toward the precision detection of low&#8208;abundance RNA.

         <title>Isolable Cysteine Sulfenyl Iodide: Stabilization by a Molecular Cradle, Crystal Structure, and Biologically Relevant Reactivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An isolable cysteine sulfenyl iodide (Cys&#8211;SI) stabilized by a molecular cradle is reported. X&#8208;ray analysis and reactivity studies reveal hydrolysis to sulfenic acid, electrophilic substitution with indoles, and high reactivity toward amines and dimedone, providing direct evidence for long&#8208;standing proposals on iodine&#8208;mediated protein modification.

Cysteine sulfenyl iodides (Cys&#8211;SIs) have long been recognized as important intermediates in the oxidative modification of cysteine thiols since 1950s, implicated in pathways such as hydrolysis to cysteine sulfenic acid (Cys&#8211;SOH) and electrophilic aromatic substitution with an indole ring of tryptophan to form Cys&#8211;Trp thioether linkages. Despite their proposed significance in both biological and chemical contexts, direct examination of Cys&#8211;SIs has been precluded by their intrinsic instability. Herein, the first isolation of a small&#8208;molecule Cys&#8211;SI, stabilized using a nanosized molecular cradle at the N&#8208;terminus of cysteine, is reported. The structure of the isolable Cys&#8211;SI is determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography, and its reactivity is investigated with a range of nucleophiles. Hydrolysis to Cys&#8211;SOH and reaction with an indole derivative provide direct chemical evidence for long&#8208;standing mechanistic proposals. Furthermore, rapid formation of sulfenamides with amines and high&#8208;yield adduct formation with dimedone, a canonical sulfenic&#8208;acid probe, reveal that Cys&#8211;SI possesses even greater electrophilicity than Cys&#8211;SOH. These results deliver a structurally defined reference for Cys&#8211;SI and inform mechanisms of iodine&#8208;mediated protein oxidation and peptide modification.

         <title>Polyvalent Thioesters as Multifunctional Chemical Anchors: Toward Synthesis of Homo/Hetero Peptide or Miniprotein Multimers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a new method for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of multimeric peptides/miniproteins using polyvalent thioesters as chemical core units, beginning with polyvalent NHS&#8208;esters and employing native chemical ligation (NCL). Moreover, homo/hetero branching multimers were also synthesized by combining reverse thioether ligation with NCL. This modular approach should give access to peptide dendrimers with unique biological implications.

In this work, we develop a platform for multimerizing peptides/miniproteins using various polyvalent thioester cores derived from easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide esters. We employed native chemical ligation to attach multiple copies of peptide/miniprotein around a fixed multi&#8208;armed thioester core in a one&#8208;pot fashion, leading to the first&#8208;generation multimers. Further, using a reverse thioether ligation strategy, we synthesized second&#8208;generation branched homo/hetero multimers. The reactions proceed under an aqueous environment that closely mimics physiological conditions, forming multimeric products with yields ranging from 30% to 90%. The general utility of this strategy is showcased by the synthesis of multimeric linear and bicyclic peptides, bicyclic peptide&#8208;cell penetrating peptide conjugates, and multimeric miniproteins which show picomolar affinity against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 receptor binding domain. We believe that this modular approach of generating multimeric molecules should find broad applicability in peptide chemistry and chemical biology.

&lt;p&gt;This work demonstrates a new method for the one-pot synthesis of multimeric peptides/miniproteins using polyvalent thioesters as chemical core units, beginning with polyvalent NHS-esters and employing native chemical ligation (NCL). Moreover, homo/hetero branching multimers were also synthesized by combining reverse thioether ligation with NCL. This modular approach should give access to peptide dendrimers with unique biological implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we develop a platform for multimerizing peptides/miniproteins using various polyvalent thioester cores derived from easy-to-synthesize N-hydroxysuccinimide esters. We employed native chemical ligation to attach multiple copies of peptide/miniprotein around a fixed multi-armed thioester core in a one-pot fashion, leading to the first-generation multimers. Further, using a reverse thioether ligation strategy, we synthesized second-generation branched homo/hetero multimers. The reactions proceed under an aqueous environment that closely mimics physiological conditions, forming multimeric products with yields ranging from 30% to 90%. The general utility of this strategy is showcased by the synthesis of multimeric linear and bicyclic peptides, bicyclic peptide-cell penetrating peptide conjugates, and multimeric miniproteins which show picomolar affinity against SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain. We believe that this modular approach of generating multimeric molecules should find broad applicability in peptide chemistry and chemical biology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strategies for the Generation of Bispecific Antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bispecific antibodies can simultaneously recognize two distinct antigens or epitopes, thereby exhibiting cooperative therapeutic effects in various diseases. This review summarizes the genetic engineering and chemical conjugation strategies that have been developed to facilitate the preparation of bispecific antibodies. The advantages and disadvantages of these methods, as well as the technical challenges that currently remain in the preparation of bispecific antibodies are also discussed.

Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are engineered immunoglobulins that can simultaneously recognize two distinct antigens or two distinct epitopes on the same antigen. They exhibit cooperative therapeutic effects surpassing those of natural monoclonal antibodies, such as bridging the immune cells and tumor cells to stimulate targeted immune response, or blocking codependent signaling pathways. These advantages make them attractive therapeutic reagents for various diseases such as cancers, immunodeficiency syndromes, and ophthalmic disorders. However, the unique structural characteristics of BsAbs pose various challenges to their preparation. In the past few decades, various types of BsAbs have been designed and prepared through genetic engineering or chemical conjugation strategies, many of which have been approved as drugs or entered clinical trials. This review provides a systematic summary of these strategies and their corresponding principles, and focuses on the application of modern genetic engineering and chemical conjugation methods in the generation of BsAbs.

         <title>The APEXTAC System for Ligand&#8208;Guided Proximity Labeling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unbiased identification of drug&#8208;targets in live cells is essential for understanding the mechanism&#8208;of&#8208;action and potential off&#8208;target effects of drugs. Herein, the APEXTAC system, a small&#8208;molecule&#8208;guided proximity labeling platform is introduced based on the APEX2 peroxidase proximity labeling enzyme. This system facilitates rapid live cell target&#8208;ID across numerous targets and molecules, highlighting its potential application to the targeted protein degradation field.&#160;

Unbiased identification of drug&#8208;targets in live cells is essential for understanding the mechanism&#8208;of&#8208;action and potential off&#8208;target effects of drugs. The BioTAC system to measure these effects is previously developed. However, BioTAC has limitations, including lysine&#8208;directed biotinylation chemistry, and relatively long biotin labeling times. Herein, the development of the APEXTAC system, a small molecule guided proximity labeling platform based on the APEX2 peroxidase proximity labeling enzyme, is described as a complementary tool. A head&#8208;to&#8208;head comparison is performed between the APEXTAC system and the BioTAC system for (+)&#8208;JQ1 target&#8208;ID and demonstrated that APEXTAC can label E3&#8208;ligases via their ligands without requiring a proteasome inhibitor which can significantly perturb cell state. The APEXTAC system supports live cell target&#8208;ID across numerous molecules and targets, including components of the protein homeostasis machinery, without degradation of the labeling system, highlighting its potential application to the targeted protein degradation field.

         <title>De Novo Discovery of Bicyclic Competitive Inhibitors of Zika Virus Protease from Peptide&#8211;Bismuth Phage Display Screening</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
De novo peptide inhibitors targeting the Zika virus protease active site are discovered using phage display and Bi(III)&#8208;mediated bicyclization. Competitive elution of bound phages with a boronate inhibitor enriches dibasic peptide sequences that resemble the substrate recognition motif, yielding a micromolar bicyclic inhibitor with high proteolytic stability.

No specific vaccines or therapeutics are currently available for the prevention or treatment of Zika virus infections. The viral protease NS2B&#8208;NS3 is essential for the replication of Zika and other orthoflaviviruses, making it a target for antiviral drug development. Traditional discovery of competitive inhibitors has relied on substrate recognition sequences, typically yielding multibasic peptides. Herein, a de novo strategy is presented for identifying competitive inhibitors using peptide phage display in combination with Bi(III)&#8208;mediated in&#8201;situ formation of bicyclic peptides. In an initial screening, phages displaying a library of randomized peptide&#8208;bismuth bicycles are eluted by interrupting the phage&#8208;target interactions at low pH. This approach yields a small number of peptides biased toward the active site, characterized by dibasic motifs, but only one low&#8208;ranking sequence shows modest inhibitory activity. To enhance specificity, a second screening campaign employs competitive phage elution using the dibasic boronate inhibitor CN&#8208;714 that covalently binds to the catalytically active serine residue S135 of NS2B&#8208;NS3. This strategy enriches a larger pool of competitive inhibitors sharing the characteristic dibasic substrate recognition motif. The most potent peptide&#8208;bismuth bicycle identified and synthesized features a completely novel sequence, exhibits an inhibition constant of 3.9&#8201;&#181;M and displays remarkable proteolytic stability over 24&#8201;h.

         <title>8&#8208;Oxo&#8208;7,8&#8208;Dihydroguanine can Improve Aptamer Affinity Toward Argininamide and its Selective Oxidation Promotes Crosslinks Formation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of incorporating 8&#8208;oxo&#8208;7,8&#8208;dihydroguanine (OG) in the DNA aptamer selected against argininamide are investigated. The presence of one OG is found, depending on its position in the recognition site, to increase, not affect, or decrease the affinity of the aptamer for its target. In addition, selective OG oxidation is shown to promote the efficient formation of aptamer&#8208;target crosslinks.

The effects of the substitution of a guanine (G) base by the oxidative lesion 8&#8208;oxo&#8208;7,8&#8208;dihydroguanine (OG) on the affinity of the DNA aptamer selected against L&#8208;argininamide (L&#8208;Rm) are studied. Results indicate that, depending on the position of the modified base located in the recognition site, the substitution of only one G by OG could either reduce, not affect, or increase such an affinity. In addition, attempts are carried out to promote chemical crosslinks between the aptamer and its target following selective oxidation of OG. Results show that such crosslinks could be produced with a high efficacy through nucleophilic addition of L&#8208;argininamide, presumably onto the C5 position of the oxidized OG base inserted into the aptamer in any position, and that no crosslink is generated for the original aptamer (not containing any OG). However, such reaction being very efficient, crosslinks are also produced between L&#8208;argininamide and oligonucleotides (including scramble sequences) that are not supposed to bind to that amino acid. Such an effect could be explained by the electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged oligonucleotides and the protonated amino acid, which favor the formation of crosslinks upon OG oxidation. Efforts to decrease formation of such nonspecific crosslinks are only partly successful.

         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;triggered bond cleavage is an essential biotechnology in chemical biology research. This concept highlights three photocleavable modalities&#8212;proteins, small molecules, and metal complexes&#8212;distilling design principles for wavelength tuning, cleavage efficiency, and biocompatibility. By comparing strengths/limits, we discuss the next generation of photo&#8208;responsive tools for biological research.

The spatiotemporal control of biomolecular functions via light&#8208;triggered bond cleavage has emerged as a powerful approach in chemical biology and cell biology. In this concept review, three major modalities of photo&#8208;cleavable systems&#8212;proteins, small molecules, and metal complexes&#8212;are classified and discussed, highlighting their design principles, biological applicability, and remaining challenges. Emphasis is placed on recent efforts to address key design challenges&#8212;such as balancing functional performance, biological compatibility, and optical responsiveness&#8212;across different molecular modalities, offering perspectives for the next generation of photo&#8208;responsive tools for biological research.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Ultra&#8208;Fast Duplex Invasion Targeting Long&#8208;Range Double&#8208;Stranded DNA Using Artificial Nucleotide</title>

Photo&#8208;induced ultra&#8208;fast duplex invasion via ultra&#8208;fast photo&#8208;crosslinker, 3&#8208;cyanovinylcarbazole nucleoside (CNVK), aiming for fast high&#8208;efficiency invasion.

Genomic DNA stores genetic information and regulates functions of various biological processes. Genetic diseases can be caused by abnormal gene expression. Genetic manipulation requires sequence&#8208;selective recognition of double&#8208;stranded DNAs, various chemical approaches for double&#8208;duplex invasion have been developed. In the previous research, a photo&#8208;induced double&#8208;duplex invasion (pDDI) is introduced that uses artificial nucleotides, 3&#8208;cyanovinylcarbazole nucleoside (CNVK) as photo&#8208;crosslinker and 5&#8208;cyanouridine (CU) as inter&#8208;probe photo&#8208;crosslinking inhibitor. In this study, while investigating the invasion mechanism of the pDDI, the invasion independence of pDDI probes is discovered and proposed a photo&#8208;induced duplex invasion (pDI) that achieves fast invasion using only CNVK while still maintaining a high invasion efficiency. This rapid pDI approach provides a powerful new tool for site&#8208;specific manipulation of genomic DNA.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Activated Transcription Factor&#8208;Targeted Proteolysis&#8208;Targeting Chimeras Nanomachine for Targeted Degradation of Transcription Factors</title>

Schematic diagram of near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;activatable proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras nanocage design and its protein&#8208;of&#8208;interest degradation mechanism. The images used on the BioRender have been licensed.

Transcription factors (TFs) are important gene regulators whose abnormal expression or function is involved in the occurrence of various diseases. The emergence of transcription factor&#8208;targeted proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (TF&#8208;PROTACs) using DNA with a specific sequence as the targeting ligand of TFs provides a promising strategy to overcome the difficulties of using small molecules to inhibit TFs without well&#8208;defined ligand&#8208;binding pockets. A smart nanomachine is reported to realize near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;triggered release and activation of TF&#8208;PROTAC using upconversion nanoparticles loaded with caged TF&#8208;PROTAC targeting the transcriptional factor NF&#8208;&#954;B. The release of the active TF degrader (dNF&#8208;&#954;B) under 980&#8201;nm NIR irradiation is demonstrated in a controlled manner, enabling precise control of the degradation of the transcriptional factor NF&#8208;&#954;B p65 in live cells. The construction of the NIR&#8208;responsive nanomachine makes it possible to load and release various TF&#8208;PROTACs to degrade different transcriptional factors on demand with spatial and temporal resolution.

         <title>Enhancing Antigen Recognition of Living Cells by Site&#8208;Specific VHH Antibody Conjugation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Site&#8208;specific incorporation of azido&#8208;phenylalanine (AzF) into antibodies enables precise conjugation, allowing anti&#8208;mCherry variable domains of heavy&#8208;chain&#8208;only antibodies (VHHs) to be aligned and immobilized on dibenzylcyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;coated glass via click chemistry. The mCherry&#8208;expressing HeLa cells adhered to the VHH&#8208;coated glass, whereas unmodified HeLa cells did not.

Biosensors and microdevices using living cells have gained significant attention in recent years, including methods for cell immobilization on antibody&#8208;coated surfaces. Random antibody fixation may lead to suboptimal exposure of recognition sites, reducing interaction efficiency. In contrast, aligned antibody immobilization enhances antigen recognition and binding capacity during cell immobilization. Site incorporation of azido&#8208;phenylalanine (AzF) into antibodies facilitates site&#8208;specific conjugation, enabling aligned antibody immobilization. In this study, we expressed and purified anti&#8208;mCherry variable domains of heavy&#8208;chain&#8208;only antibodies (VHHs), incorporating AzF at the C&#8208;terminus using an unnatural amino acid system to ensure its placement away from the antigen&#8208;binding site for mCherry. Anti&#8208;mCherry VHH&#8208;AzF was conjugated to dibenzylcyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;coated glass via click chemistry, followed by incubation with HeLa cells expressing mCherry on their surfaces (mCherry&#8208;coated cells). This resulted in increased immobilization of mCherry&#8208;coated cells on the VHH&#8208;coated glass, whereas normal HeLa cells did not adhere.

Gelatin Methacrylate Coating on 3D&#8208;Printed Poly(esterurethane) Scaffolds Improves Cell Adhesion and Proliferation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the dip&#8208;coating of poly(esterurethane) (SPEU) scaffolds with gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) successfully transform them from cell&#8208;repellent surfaces into bioactive platforms that support cellular proliferation and metabolic activity. An innovative system is developed that combines 3D printing and photopolymerization strategies to fabricate biofunctional GelMA&#8208;SPEU60 scaffolds.

A key challenge in tissue engineering is developing scaffolds that balance mechanical strength and bioactivity. Segmented poly(esterurethanes) (SPEU) are versatile polymers widely used in biomedical applications, particularly in the fabrication of elastomeric scaffolds for tissue engineering. Their mechanical properties and degradation rates can be tailored by modifying their chemical composition and morphology. However, the inherent hydrophobicity of SPEU often limits cell adhesion and proliferation, affecting their biocompatibility. To address this issue, surface modification, such as controlled dip&#8208;coating in gelatin methacrylate (GelMA), was explored in this work to enhance cell&#8208;material interactions. 3D&#8208;printed SPEU60 structures (with 60% hard segment content) are fabricated, surface&#8208;modified, and characterized using scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and goniometry. The ability of these scaffolds to support cell adhesion, proliferation, and viability, is evaluated in&#8201;vitro using lentivirus transfected green fluorescent 3T3&#8208;L1 murine preadipocyte cells. Results from these biological activity assays demonstrate that the GelMA coating significantly enhances the cellular response. In conclusion, these GelMA&#8208;SPEU60 structures can be considered extracellular matrices suitable for tissue engineering applications.

The therapeutic application of glucagon starts as a difficult&#8208;to&#8208;use emergency hormone and is now evolving into a next&#8208;generation metabolic therapy through advances in understanding its physiological functions. This review highlights how engineering strategies enhance glucagon usability, stability, and delivery, and expand its application from hypoglycemia rescue to the treatment of obesity and metabolic diseases.

Glucagon, a 29&#8208;amino acid pancreatic hormone, plays a central role in glucose homeostasis through activation of the glucagon receptor (GCGR). While clinically essential for hypoglycemia rescue, its broader therapeutic applications face limitations due to challenging biophysical properties, including poor solubility, strong aggregation tendency, and chemical instability, which currently require lyophilized formulations. Recent advances in peptide engineering and formulation science have enabled the development of next&#8208;generation glucagon analogs with enhanced stability and ready&#8208;to&#8208;use profiles. Moving beyond its classical role in glucose elevation, glucagon is now recognized as a multifunctional metabolic regulator influencing lipid metabolism, energy expenditure, and cardiorenal function. This expanded understanding has driven the development of innovative GCGR&#8208;targeting therapies, including multireceptor agonists such as glucagon&#8208;like peptide&#8208;1 receptor (GLP&#8208;1R)/GCGR co&#8208;agonists for metabolic disorders and advanced dual&#8208;hormone delivery systems. This review examines the evolving pharmacology of glucagon by analyzing: 1) structural optimization and formulation strategies to address physicochemical challenges, 2) innovative delivery technologies, and 3) emerging therapeutic applications in metabolic diseases. Through critical assessment of translational challenges, this work bridges molecular insights with clinical innovation in glucagon&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Fluorescent Dyes for Differential Scanning Fluorimetry of RNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selection of nucleic acid dyes was tested for their efficacy in determining RNA melting temperatures utilizing differential scanning fluorimetry. Two model systems were used to determine what effects the dyes have on RNA melting temperature and fluorescence intensity, and to evaluate each dye based on the strength of its DSF response. Additionally, we tested each dye's effectiveness at detecting ligand binding to the neomycin&#8208;sensing riboswitch.

Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) to determine the thermal stability of RNA has only recently been adapted from proteins using the nucleic acid dye RiboGreen. Here, we investigate the suitability of seven commercially available nucleic acid dyes for use in DSF on RNA&#8212;acridine orange, ethidium bromide, RiboGreen, OliGreen, SYBR Green II, SYBR Gold, and TOTO&#8208;1 iodide&#8212;using a double&#8208;stranded RNA model and the 27&#8208;nt neomycin&#8208;sensing riboswitch aptamer. Concentration&#8208;dependent DSF curves revealed pronounced dye&#8208;specific effects on both initial fluorescence and apparent melting temperatures. RiboGreen and OliGreen yielded concentration&#8208;independent melting temperatures within experimental error, whereas SYBR derivatives, acridine orange, and ethidium bromide stabilized RNA progressively with increasing dye concentration, shifting the melting temperature by up to +9&#8201;&#176;C. Taken together, the data identify RiboGreen and OliGreen as probes for use in DSF on RNA that minimize dye&#8208;induced artifacts while preserving robust signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise, and they provide a framework for tailoring DSF conditions to specific RNA targets and ligand&#8208;binding screens. Other tested dyes displaying concentration&#8208;dependent melting temperatures are suitable as well but require appropriate care when utilizing them in DSF on RNA.

Fabrication of Nanocatalytic Medicine from Self&#8208;Assembling Peptides Containing an ATCUN&#8208;Like Copper&#8208;Binding Motif for Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembling peptide with amino&#8208;terminal copper and nickel motifs is developed which can work as an effective platform for fabricating biocompatible and catalytic nanomedicine with multioxidase activities and synergistic cancer therapy.

Development of nanomaterials with multiple enzymatic activities via a facile approach receives growing interests in recent years. Although peptide self&#8208;assembling provides an effective approach for the construction of biomimetic materials in recent years, fabrication of artificial enzymes from self&#8208;assembling peptides with multiple catalytic activities for anticancer therapy is still a challenge. Herein, a simple method is reported to prepare nanocatalysts with multienzyme&#8208;like activities from self&#8208;assembling peptides containing amino&#8208;terminal copper and nickel (ATCUN) copper&#8208;binding motifs. With the aid of the coordination interactions between the ATCUN motif and Cu(II) ions, these peptides can perform supramolecular self&#8208;assembly to form nanomaterials with biomimetic peroxidase, ascorbate oxidase, and glutathione peroxidase activities. Moreover, these trienzyme&#8208;like effects can elevate oxidative stress levels and suppress the antioxidative capability of cancer cells, which synergistically induce the apoptosis of cancer cells. Because of the high biocompatibility, catalytic activities, and drug encapsulation properties, this self&#8208;assembled peptide provides a biomimetic platform for the development of new nanocatalytic medicines for multimodal synergistic cancer therapies.

         <title>A Drug Screening Targeting Upregulation of Syk Gene Identifies Neochlorogenic Acid and L&#8208;Arabinitol Capable of Inducing the M2 Phenotype of Microglia in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microglial reporter screening identified neochlorogenic acid and L&#8208;arabinitol as spleen tyrosine kinase&#8208;upregulating compounds that promote microglial M2 polarization and Amyloid&#8208;&#946; phagocytosis, offering a novel therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease.

Despite numerous therapeutic attempts of Alzheimer's disease (AD), treatment options remain limited. Targeting microglia (MG) polarization from M1 to M2 is considered a promising approach, yet no drug specifically modulating this transition has been identified. The spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) has emerged as a potential therapeutic target due to its role in regulating AD risk genes and promoting Amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) clearance. Herein, a microglial reporter gene screening model targeting Syk is developed and two small molecules, neochlorogenic acid (NCGA) and L&#8208;arabinitol (L&#8208;Ara), that can upregulate Syk gene expression, leading to the activation of MG M2 phenotype, are identified. Furthermore, these compounds markedly enhance the capacity of MG to migrate toward A&#946; and phagocytose A&#946;. However, when Syk expression is silenced using shRNA, the ability of these small molecules to induce the MG M2 phenotype and promote A&#946; phagocytosis by MG is substantially attenuated. These findings offer new insights into AD therapy development.

         <title>Optimizing the Cell Number and Size for Tumor Spheroid Modeling Using Amyloid Hydrogel</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peptide&#8208;based functional amyloid hydrogel is fabricated for an in vitro 3D breast cancer spheroid model with epithelial and stromal cell lines. Viable and proliferative mono as well as co&#8208;culture tumor spheroids are developed within 7 days using this technology, even at low cell densities, which also display angiogenic potential.

One of the leading reasons of female mortality on a global scale is breast cancer. Tumor size has been a crucial parameter in predicting the rate of tumor growth and metastasis. Regular core biopsy techniques usually result in a low yield of cancer cells. Hence, developing an in vitro platform with low cell numbers can be an invaluable tool for studying breast cancer. 3D spheroid culture is a promising alternative to animal models for applications such as drug testing and personalized medicine. The self&#8208;assembling KLMEI peptide amyloid hydrogel can be used as a matrix to support tumor spheroid formation for MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 and MCF&#8208;7 cells across various cell numbers. Over 7 days, MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 spheroids exhibited higher proliferation than MCF&#8208;7, even at low cell numbers. Overall, the study shows that by adjusting the cell&#8208;to&#8208;gel ratios, viable spheroids can be developed to mimic different&#8208;sized in vivo tumors. The ability of the hydrogel to support co&#8208;culture spheroids formation is also examined by introducing fibroblasts with MCF&#8208;7 cells to induce angiogenesis and mimic the heterogeneous cell environment typical of in vivo tumors. Therefore, this platform possesses a promising potential for developing 3D spheroids to study the different aspects of breast cancer.

         <title>DNA Binding Study of a Redox Active Enantiopure Bis(arylimino)acenaphthene (BIAN) Os(II) Bipyridine Complex</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a novel dicationic osmium polypyridyl complex featuring the bis(arylimino)acenaphthene ligand demonstrates interesting redox properties. Successful enantiomer resolution reveals that the delta isomer is a strong DNA grove binder.

This work presents the synthesis, characterization, and evaluation of DNA binding for a bis(arylimino)acenaphthene (BIAN) containing Os(II) octahedral dipyridyl complex [Os(dmbpy)2BIAN](An)2 [1](An)2 (dmbpy&#8201;=&#8201;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl, BIAN&#8201;=&#8201;bis(arylimino)acenaphthene, An&#8201;=&#8201;PF6&#8722; or Cl&#8722;). Complex 1 is characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography and cyclic voltammetry, which reveal a series of fully reversible redox couples. The visible absorption spectrum is dominated by metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer bands between 400 and 600&#8201;nm, whose assignment is supported by time dependent density functional theory computational studies with solvent corrections. For the first time, chiral discriminating chromatography is used to resolve the &#916;&#8208; and &#923;&#8208;enantiomers of a metal BIAN complex. UV&#8211;visible absorption and circular dichroism measurements reveal significant differences in the binding strength of the enantiomers to double&#8208;stranded natural DNA, with a greater affinity observed for &#916;&#8208;1 (Kb&#8201;&#8776;&#8201;106&#8201;&#8201;M&#8722;1), which is comparable to that observed for other group 8 polypyridyl intercalating species and is supported by the thermal denaturation temperature recorded in the presence of DNA. Linear dichroism confirms that both enantiomeric species bind through the intercalation of the BIAN component. The development of DNA&#8208;binding chiral metal complexes containing redox&#8208;active ligands described in this work offers the potential to expand the activity of therapeutic bioinorganic systems in new directions.

         <title>Membrane Tethering of Honeybee Antimicrobial Peptides in Drosophila Enhances Pathogen Defense at the Cost of Stress&#8208;Induced Host Vulnerability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confocal images showing bacterial proliferation in the Drosophila gut reveal antimicrobial activity of t&#8208;Def1(tethered defensin1) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent a promising alternative to conventional antibiotics in combating multidrug&#8208;resistant pathogens, yet their clinical translation is hindered by proteolytic instability, cytotoxicity, and poor bioavailability. Herein, it is demonstrated that glycosylphosphatidylinositol&#8208;mediated membrane tethering of honeybee defensin1 (Def1) in Drosophila melanogasterenhances its antimicrobial efficacy by &#8776;$$\approx$$100&#8208;fold compared to secreted or untethered forms, while preserving physiological and behavioral integrity under baseline conditions. Using a genetically engineered Drosophila model, three Def1 variants are expressed: native (Def1), secreted (s&#8208;Def1), and membrane&#8208;tethered (t&#8208;Def1). Flies expressing t&#8208;Def1 exhibit superior bacterial clearance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and show improved survival postinfection, with no adverse effects on locomotion, courtship, or sleep architecture. However, under stress paradigms&#8212;including sleep deprivation and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)&#8208;induced gut injury&#8212;t&#8208;Def1 exacerbates intestinal barrier dysfunction, as evidenced by elevated Smurf phenotype incidence, highlighting a trade&#8208;off between antimicrobial potency and epithelial vulnerability. This work establishes Drosophila as a powerful platform for dissecting AMP mechanisms and engineering spatially targeted therapies, offering translational insights for pollinator health and human infectious disease management. These results advocate for iterative refinement of membrane&#8208;anchoring strategies to balance therapeutic efficacy with host safety, advancing the development of next&#8208;generation AMPs with minimized off&#8208;target effects.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Efficient Synthesis of Enantiomerically Pure (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;n&#8208;Butylphthalide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;catalyzed strategy for the stereoselective synthesis of chiral 3&#8208;n&#8208;Butylphthalide (NBP), an effective commercial drug for treating acute ischemic stroke, is developed. Two carbonyl reductases, SmCRK6 and SsCRK1, are used to produce (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;NBP continuously from aromatic ketones with 94% ee (S) and 99% ee (R), achieving space&#8208;time yields that are 9&#8208;fold and 30&#8208;fold higher, respectively, than those obtained in batch reactions.

3&#8208;n&#8208;Butylphthalide (NBP) is an effective commercial drug for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, with its S&#8208;enantiomer, (S)&#8208;NBP, demonstrating clinical superiority over (R)&#8208;NBP. However, the stereoselective synthesis of both enantiomers with high enantiomeric excess (ee) presents significant challenges. Herein, a novel enzymatic strategy for the efficient and highly stereoselective synthesis of (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;NBPs under mild reaction conditions is presented. Specifically, two carbonyl reductases, SmCRK6 and SsCRK1, are engineered to facilitate the asymmetric reduction of the prochiral aromatic ketone, 2&#8208;pentanoyl benzonitrile (1), followed by intramolecular cyclization to produce chiral NBPs. SmCRK6 exhibits a catalytic activity of 0.46&#8201;Umg&#8722;1 protein, which is 23&#8208;fold greater than that of its parent enzyme, SmCRV4, and the ee value of (S)&#8208;NBP increases from 2% to 94% (S). The catalytic activity of SsCRK1 (9.46&#8201;U mg&#8722;1 protein) is fourfold higher than that of its parent, SsCR, and the ee of (R)&#8208;NBP reachs 99%. In the preparative synthesis, (S)&#8208;NBP and (R)&#8208;NBP are generated continuously in a 3D microfluidic reactor, achieving space&#8208;time yields that are 9&#8208;fold and 30&#8208;fold higher, respectively, than those obtained in batch reactions. This continuous&#8208;flow enzymatic process has the potential for future scale&#8208;up for the industrial production of these important chiral drugs and similar derivatives.

         <dc:description>
Transformable peptides, driven by diverse noncovalent interactions, can self&#8208;assemble into nanostructures with distinct properties and functions. This review outlines their molecular design, structural transformation mechanisms, and biomedical applications in imaging, cancer therapy, and infection treatment, highlighting their potential for precise diagnosis and clinical translation. Created with https://BioRender.com.

Transformable peptides, driven by diverse intermolecular forces, can undergo self&#8208;assembly and morphological transformation into a variety of nanostructures with distinct physicochemical properties and biological functions. Compared with traditional materials, deformable peptides have a unique structural tunability and a modular feature that enable them to precisely target specific pathological sites, interfere with cell behavior, and thereby exert different biological activities. In recent years, research on self&#8208;assembling peptides has advanced considerably, progressing from rational molecular design in the laboratory toward clinical translation. This review systematically summarizes the molecular building blocks of peptides, the noncovalent interactions guiding the formation of secondary structures, and the key factors influencing their transformation into various nanostructures. In addition, the biomedical applications of these transformable nanostructures in disease imaging, cancer therapy, and antimicrobial treatment are highlighted, with a particular emphasis on their advantages in disease diagnosis and therapeutic precision. Overall, transformable peptides represent a highly promising class of biomaterials, offering valuable insights and potential for future clinical translation in biomedicine.

         <title>Synthesis and Application of Photocleavable Oligonucleotides Containing 1,2&#8208;Diol&#8208;Conjugated Phosphotriester</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocleavable oligonucleotides (ONs) containing 1,2&#8208;diol&#8208;conjugated phosphotriesters are designed and synthesized. The ONs containing cyclic 1,2&#8208;diol show efficient self&#8208;cleavage in neutral aqueous solution upon photoirradiation and can form stable duplexes with the complementary strands. The thermal stability of the duplex is significantly reduced by photocleavage. In addition, the photocleavable ON is applied to DNA&#8208;templated synthesis in the presence of competitive ONs.

Photocleavable oligonucleotides (ONs) containing a nonnucleosidic photocleavable spacer have been applied in a variety of chemical and biological tools. In this study, novel photocleavable ONs containing 1,2&#8208;diol&#8208;conjugated phosphotriesters without an extra spacer are designed and synthesized. The ONs containing cyclic 1,2&#8208;diol efficiently self&#8208;cleave in neutral aqueous solution upon photoirradiation, forming stable duplexes with the complementary strands. The thermal stability of the duplex is significantly reduced after photoirradiation. This characteristic is applied to DNA&#8208;templated synthesis in the presence of competitive ONs.

The ONs containing cyclic 1,2-diol show efficient self-cleavage in neutral aqueous solution upon photoirradiation and can form stable duplexes with the complementary strands. The thermal stability of the duplex is significantly reduced by photocleavage. In addition, the photocleavable ON is applied to DNA-templated synthesis in the presence of competitive ONs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photocleavable oligonucleotides (ONs) containing a nonnucleosidic photocleavable spacer have been applied in a variety of chemical and biological tools. In this study, novel photocleavable ONs containing 1,2-diol-conjugated phosphotriesters without an extra spacer are designed and synthesized. The ONs containing cyclic 1,2-diol efficiently self-cleave in neutral aqueous solution upon photoirradiation, forming stable duplexes with the complementary strands. The thermal stability of the duplex is significantly reduced after photoirradiation. This characteristic is applied to DNA-templated synthesis in the presence of competitive ONs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Route to Design Novel Functional Peptides by Applying a Denoising Diffusional Model to mRNA Display Libraries</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A denoising diffusional implicit model (DDIM) is trained using sequencing data from mRNA display selections to generate novel peptide sequences. This approach integrates experimental and computational methods to efficiently design peptides with enhanced binding properties, accelerating ligand discovery.

In&#8201;vitro directed evolution techniques, such as mRNA display, enable peptide ligand discovery and optimization. However, physical libraries that rely on a genetic code can only search a small fraction of sequence space due to inherent biases in the genetic code and experimental limitations. To address this challenge, denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs) are applied to generate novel peptide ligands against B&#8208;cell lymphoma extra&#8208;large (Bcl&#8208;xL), a key cancer target. Starting with high&#8208;throughput sequencing data from previous selections, a DDIM is trained to produce novel sequences with high affinity binding. Experimental validation confirms that most generated sequences are functionally equivalent to the original library members for Bcl&#8208;xL binding and demonstrated comparable binding kinetics and affinity relative to the wildtype and nearest original neighbors. Importantly, this approach generated rare sequences not easily accessible via mutation and directed evolution. These results indicate that DDIMs can complement and expand directed evolution data, efficiently exploring underrepresented regions of sequence space. This approach provides a broadly applicable framework for accelerating ligand discovery and optimizing molecular properties across diverse targets.

         <title>Comparative Structural Analysis of Escherichia Coli Cyay at Room and Cryogenic Temperatures Using Macromolecular and Serial Crystallography</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature (RT) crystallography of E. coli CyaY, the bacterial frataxin homolog, reveals subtle but functionally relevant differences from cryogenic structures. The conserved fold shows distinct side&#8208;chain conformations and water networks, highlighting dynamics often hidden at low temperatures. Reduced radiation damage makes RT structures more suitable for accurate modeling and structure&#8208;based drug design.

Frataxin is a 23 kDa mitochondrial iron&#8208;binding protein involved in the biogenesis of iron&#8211;sulfur (Fe&#8211;S) clusters. Deficiency in frataxin is associated with Friedreich's ataxia, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. CyaY, the bacterial ortholog of eukaryotic frataxin, is believed to function as an iron donor in Fe&#8211;S cluster assembly, making it a key target for structural and functional studies. In this work, a comprehensive structural analysis of the Escherichia coli CyaY protein is presented, comparing its structure at room temperature and cryogenic conditions. Notably, the first room&#8208;temperature structures are obtained using the Turkish Light Source &#8220;Turkish DeLight&#8221; X&#8208;ray diffractometer and serial synchrotron X&#8208;ray crystallography, marking a significant step forward in understanding CyaY under near&#8208;physiological conditions.

         <title>Analysis of the Effects of Sugar Modifications on RNA Chemical Ligation Reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of substitutions at the 2&#8242; position of the nucleotides at the ligation site on phosphoramidate&#8208;type chemical ligation reaction efficiency is examined. The efficiency varies depending on the substituents, with the combination of a fluorine group on 5&#8242;NRNA and an O&#8208;methyl group on RNA3&#8242;P showing the highest efficiency.

Chemical ligation of RNA fragments is an effective method for synthesizing long RNAs. It is particularly useful for incorporating site&#8208;specific modifications into long RNAs; however, its low reaction efficiency remains a major challenge. Herein, 5&#8242;&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;substituted uridine or cytidine nucleotides are synthesized, which are attached to the 5&#8242; end of a synthetic RNA and conjugated with a phosphate group at the 3&#8242; end of an alternative RNA fragment, to perform a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8208;type RNA ligation. It is examined how the 2&#8242; position of nucleotides with 5&#8242;&#8208;amino or 3&#8242;&#8208;phosphate groups in the ligated site affects the ligation reaction. The 2&#8242;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;amino&#8208;nucleotide shows enhanced reactivity compared with the 2&#8242;&#8208;ribo&#8208; or 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;amino&#8208;nucleotide. In contrast, the 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;methyl modification demonstrates optimal efficacy with the 3'&#8208;phosphate nucleotide. Interestingly, the 2&#8242;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;amino nucleotide maintains remarkable reactivity, even under acidic conditions. A pre&#8208;miRNA comprising 84 nucleotides is synthesized through ligation, and the intracellular functionality of the ligated RNA is confirmed. This study elucidates the effect of 2&#8242; substituents on chemical ligation reactions, providing insights into the chemical synthesis of long RNAs.

         <title>Characterization of BRCA1&#8208;Associated Protein&#8208;1 (BAP1) Aggregation Properties Induced by Cancer&#8208;Associated Mutations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BAP1 is a master regulator of oncogenesis with many cancer&#8208;associated mutations within its N&#8208;terminal ubiquitin C&#8208;terminal hydrolase (UCH) domain. We analytically demonstrated that BAP1&#8208;UCH harboring the N78S, C91W, F81V, and G128R mutations aggregate into amyloid fibrils following a secondary nucleation aggregation model. Our study provides valuable insights into how single mutations can affect cancer progression through protein aggregation.

BRCA1&#8208;associated protein&#8208;1 (BAP1) is a tumor suppressor protein that regulates DNA transcription through its deubiquitinase activity. Cancer&#8208;associated missense mutations within its ubiquitin C&#8208;terminal hydrolase (UCH) domain result in structural destabilization and aggregation, contributing to various malignancies such as malignant mesothelioma and uveal melanoma. In this study, we investigated the aggregation mechanisms of highly destabilized BAP1&#8208;UCH variants, including N78S, C91W, F81V, and G128R, using Thioflavin T (ThT) binding assays and AmyloFit analysis. Our results reveal that all BAP1&#8208;UCH variants follow a secondary nucleation&#8208;dominated aggregation model, exhibiting strong concentration dependence and significantly higher aggregation rates, which may be responsible for their impaired nuclear import, leading to increased cytosolic retention. These findings provide critical insights into how specific mutations in BAP1 drive aggregation and compromise its tumor&#8208;suppressing functions inside the nucleus, thereby contributing to cancer progression.

         <title>Method Overview for Discovering ATE1 Substrates and their Arginylation Sites</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arginylation is a decades&#8208;old post&#8208;translational modification but is inherently difficult to study. A plurality of methods have been developed and deployed to uncover the biology and substrates of this modification. This review covers the history, major advancements, and substrates discovered over the course of six decades.

Arginylation is a protein modification event in which cellular machinery recognizes a conserved N&#8208;terminal or side&#8208;chain motif and post&#8208;translationally installs an arginine residue to signal a protein for degradation. This modification affects protein function, stability, and half&#8208;life and is essential to proper functions in mammalian systems. Since its discovery in the early 1960s, scientists have struggled to broadly characterize this modification in its canonical function outside of a handful of specific cases. It is known to be an essential cellular mark, as loss of the installation enzyme is embryonically lethal. However, the discovery of the substrates regulated by this mark has been slow and has required some creativity by the scientists who have chased it. Over the course of roughly six decades, the library of substrates has consistently grown through various applications. Here, we seek to summarize all approaches that have been applied to discovering and studying arginylation.

Over the course of roughly six decades, the library of substrates has consistently grown through various applications. Here, we seek to summarize all approaches that have been applied to discovering and studying arginylation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble Near&#8208;Infrared Ratiometric Fluorescent Probe for Selective Detection of Monoamine Oxidase A Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyma is a novel water&#8208;soluble near&#8208;infrared ratiometric fluorescent probe with high selectivity for monoamine oxidase A (MAO&#8208;A). Cyma enables sensitive, real&#8208;time detection of MAO&#8208;A activity via a distinct fluorescence shift, exhibits excellent selectivity and good performance in live&#8208;cell imaging, and holds great potential for disease diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring.

Monoamine oxidase A (MAO&#8208;A) plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter metabolism and oxidative stress regulation and is implicated in various neurological disorders and cancer progression. However, its detection is hindered by high structural similarity to its isoform MAO&#8208;B and limitations of conventional methods, which exhibit poor specificity, low sensitivity, and spectral crosstalk. To overcome these challenges, Cyma, a water&#8208;soluble near&#8208;infrared ratiometric probe engineered on a cyanine platform, is developed. Cyma integrates a sulfonated cyanine core for improved water solubility, a clorgyline&#8208;derived recognition unit to confer MAO&#8208;A selectivity, and a propylamine moiety to enable enzymatic activation. Upon interaction with MAO&#8208;A, Cyma undergoes a specific 1,6&#8208;elimination and Smiles rearrangement, yielding a distinct fluorescence shift from 805&#8201;nm to 740&#8201;nm. Cyma demonstrates excellent selectivity for MAO&#8208;A over MAO&#8208;B and exhibits high sensitivity (detection limit: 0.0035&#8201;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1), with a strong linear correlation between ratiometric fluorescence intensity and MAO&#8208;A concentration. Furthermore, excellent biocompatibility and MAO&#8208;A detection ability of Cyma are demonstrated in SH&#8208;SY5Y cells. These findings establish Cyma as a powerful tool for selectively detecting MAO&#8208;A activity, offering significant potential for disease diagnosis, therapeutic monitoring, and intraoperative imaging.

         <title>A Non&#8208;G&#8208;Quadruplex Hemin Aptamer Forms a Better Peroxidase Mimicking DNAzyme</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex aptamer exhibits peroxidase&#8208;like activity when binding to hemin, forming a DNAzyme. This DNAzyme displays a pH&#8208;rate profile similar to horseradish peroxidase, whereas a G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;based DNAzyme shows an opposite trend. These two aptamers also show distinct hemin&#8208;dependent nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy behaviors. 

G&#8208;quadruplex DNA is known to bind to hemin, forming a complex that exhibits peroxidase&#8208;like activity. A non&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex aptamer named Hem1&#8208;2T also exhibits horseradish peroxidase (HRP) like activity upon binding to hemin. Herein, the catalytic characteristics of the Hem1&#8208;2T aptamer are studied and compared with PS2.M, an extensively studied G&#8208;quadruplex. From pH 6&#8211;8, the activity of Hem1&#8208;2T decreases with the increase in pH, which is similar to HRP, whereas the activity of PS2.M increases with pH, suggesting that Hem1&#8208;2T might be a better mechanistic mimic of HRP. Additionally, Hem1&#8208;2T is more effective at protecting hemin from degradation by H2O2, as evidenced by a slower decrease in the absorbance at 404&#8201;nm compared to PS2.M and more sustained catalysis. NMR spectroscopy indicates that hemin promotes ligand&#8208;induced structure formation in the Hem1&#8208;2T aptamer and forms a specific complex, whereas hemin interacts with the PS2.M G&#8208;quadruplex in a way leading to the disappearance of NMR peaks. Overall, the Hem1&#8208;2T&#8208;hemin complex is a better and more stable HRP mimic, supporting its potential applications in bioanalysis and biocatalysis.

         <title>Design and Characterization of Prodrugged Anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 Antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Masking an anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 antibody by conjugating a large PEG molecule to specific sites is explored as a way of mitigating undesirable activity in nontarget tissues. This prodrugged antibody exhibits reduced binding to CTLA&#8208;4 and Fc gamma receptors, demonstrated high stability, and had an extended half&#8208;life in a mouse model, potentially improving the pharmacokinetic profile and safety attributes of therapeutic antibodies.

Therapeutic antibodies are widely used to treat diseases like cancer and inflammatory conditions by binding with high specificity to their molecular targets. Masking is a strategy to mitigate undesirable activity in nontarget tissues, improving safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles by reducing target&#8208;mediated drug disposition. In this article, masking of an anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 antibody by conjugating a large PEG molecule to specific sites on the antibody is explored. While anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 immunotherapy benefits solid tumor treatment, its adverse events limit its utility. Multiple conjugation sites within the complementarity&#8208;determining regions and adjacent framework regions are evaluated to attenuate CTLA&#8208;4 binding. The optimal site for maximizing masking efficiency is identified, allowing for efficient bioconjugation and functional restoration upon exposure to a cleaving enzyme in the tumor microenvironment. The prodrugged antibody exhibits reduced binding to CTLA&#8208;4 and Fc gamma receptors, high stability, and an extended half&#8208;life in a mouse model. This technology has the potential to improve the PK profile and safety attributes of therapeutic antibodies.

         <title>Covalent Stabilization of Collagen Mimetic Triple Helices and Assemblies by Dopa Crosslinking</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Collagen mimetic peptides that fold into triple helices can be covalently stabilized through a lysine&#8208;levodopa crosslink. By varying the relative amino acid positions, the stabilization degree can be tuned. This approach effectively stabilizes both homotrimeric and heterotrimeric triple helices and higher&#8208;order, collagen&#8208;mimetic fibers.

Creating thermally stable collagen mimetic peptides (CMPs) is a persistent challenge. Nature leverages covalent crosslinkings to stabilize collagen's signature triple helical tertiary structure and higher&#8208;order assemblies. Herein, crosslinkings between levodopa (Dopa) and lysine can covalently stabilize the triple helix in CMPs is demonstrated. Since alkaline conditions catalyze the oxidation of the catechol on Dopa to a benzoquinone, while being in proximity to the nucleophilic lysine, it is hypothesized that this reaction can be a facile method to covalently capture the supramolecular structure of CMPs by simply increasing the pH of the aqueous solvent with the addition of sodium hydroxide. This covalent capture strategy successfully stabilizes CMP homotrimers and a de novo designed ABC&#8208;type heterotrimer demonstrating that the Lysine&#8208;Dopa covalent bond is best templated by a supramolecular, axial cation&#8211; &#960;$\pi$ pairwise interaction. In nature, collagen can hierarchically assemble into fibers. This behavior can be mimicked with the self&#8208;assembly of CMPs, but the resulting nanofibers typically exhibit thermal stability below body temperature. In a final application, Dopa&#8211;Lysine covalent capture also enhances the thermal stability of CMP nanofibers well above 37&#8201;&#176;$^\circ$C is demonstrated. This biomimetic covalent capture strategy can stabilize a wide variety of CMP systems and potentially enable the biomedical application of these materials.

         <title>Research Progress of Functional Nucleic Acids&#8208;Based Biosensor in the Sensitive Detection of Foodborne Pathogens</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional nucleic acids, such as aptamers and DNAzymes, enable programable, high&#8208;specificity biosensors for rapid detection of foodborne pathogens. This article summarizes sensing principles and amplification strategies that advance portable and ultrasensitive food safety detection.

Foodborne pathogen contamination is a major global public health issue, highlighting the need for rapid, sensitive, and portable detection technologies. Conventional methods such as microbial culture, polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay are limited by complexity, low sensitivity, and high cost, restricting on&#8208;site use. Functional nucleic acids (FNAs), including aptamers and DNAzymes, have emerged as versatile molecular recognition elements for next&#8208;generation biosensors. Their programmability, stability, and specificity enable reliable real&#8208;time food monitoring. Moreover, nucleic acid&#8208;based signal amplification methods greatly enhance detection sensitivity.

&lt;p&gt;Functional nucleic acids, such as aptamers and DNAzymes, enable programable, high-specificity biosensors for rapid detection of foodborne pathogens. This article summarizes sensing principles and amplification strategies that advance portable and ultrasensitive food safety detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foodborne pathogen contamination is a major global public health issue, highlighting the need for rapid, sensitive, and portable detection technologies. Conventional methods such as microbial culture, polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay are limited by complexity, low sensitivity, and high cost, restricting on-site use. Functional nucleic acids (FNAs), including aptamers and DNAzymes, have emerged as versatile molecular recognition elements for next-generation biosensors. Their programmability, stability, and specificity enable reliable real-time food monitoring. Moreover, nucleic acid-based signal amplification methods greatly enhance detection sensitivity. This review summarizes recent advances in FNA-based biosensors for foodborne pathogen detection, covering screening strategies like systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment, sensing mechanisms with various readouts (fluorescence, colorimetry, electrochemistry), and innovative amplification strategies for improving practical application in food safety monitoring. Representative biosensor designs, mechanisms, and performances are highlighted. Finally, existing challenges and future perspectives for enhancing detection accuracy are discussed.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of Glucosides and Aminoglycosides to Combat Resistant Resistance</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic photocatalysts to alkylate monosaccharides, polysaccharides, and biomolecules containing glucose motifs&#8212;including the aminoglycoside antibiotics kanamycin and amikacin&#8212;are used and their biological activity, resulting in a kanamycin derivative with a 30&#8208;fold improved minimal inhibitory concentrations, is tested.

The rapid emergence of resistant bacteria and the scarcity of the antibiotic pipeline have been a persistent threat to global health. To expand the antibiotic pipeline,the strategy has focused on revitalizing the current antibiotic via novel site&#8208;specific derivatization. Aminoglycosides (AGs), once considered effective therapeutics for treating clinical infections, are now used to a limited extent due to drug&#8208;induced toxicity and AG&#8208;resistant bacteria. Challenges in the synthesis and modification of AGs impede their potential for regain efficacy. Herein, a photoredox catalyzed late&#8208;stage modification of glucosides including AGs is discussed. The chemistry can selectively install an alkyl group at the 3&#8208;position of unprotected glucoside with a broad substrate scope and high yields. Among the products, a series of compounds are characterized that can overcome drug resistance caused by APH(3&#8242;) and one of them achieves 30&#8208;fold potency compared to kanamycin against sensitive strains. The chemistry described here opens a new avenue for discovering new AG antibiotics that overcome drug resistance and may also serve as the basis for understanding their structure&#8211;activity relationships.

Synthesis of an N&#8208;Galactosyl Norbornane Aziridine and its Potent Mixed Inhibition of Aspergillus oryzae &#946;&#8208;Galactosidase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;galactosyl aziridine is found to have &#956;M range mixed inhibition constants (Ki and Ki&#8217;) for a fungal &#946;&#8208;galactosidase.

Aziridine&#8208;bearing cyclic polyols are established as irreversible covalent inhibitors of glycosyl hydrolases and have been employed as activity&#8208;based probes. In the present study, the stereoselective synthesis of a novel N&#8208;galactosyl aziridine derivative on a norbornane scaffold and its subsequent evaluation as an inhibitor of glycosyl hydrolase activity are described. The diastereoselective Huisgen cycloaddition between 2,3,4,6&#8208;tetra&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;galactopyranosyl azide and norbornene yields exo&#8208;triazoline intermediates of norbornane. Following the removal of the acetyl protecting groups and a silica gel&#8208;mediated decomposition of the triazoline intermediates, exo N&#8208;galactopyranosyl norbornane aziridine (N&#8208;(&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;galactopyranosyl)&#8208;exo&#8208;3&#8208;azatricyclo[3.2.1.02,4]octane, NGNA) is obtained. Enzymatic assays demonstrate that NGNA exerts potent mixed&#8208;mode inhibition of Aspergillus oryzae &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, while exhibiting significant selectivity over green coffee bean &#945;&#8208;galactosidase.

         <title>Developing FGF2 Mutants with Selectively Reduced Heparan Sulfate Affinity to Explore their Impact on FGFR1 Signaling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism by which the coreceptor heparan sulfate (HS) contributes to Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)/FGF receptor (FGFR) signaling remains unclear. In this study, FGF2 mutants with selectively reduced HS affinity were rationally designed through in silico analysis. Analyses of designed mutants provided important insights, suggesting that the contribution of FGF2/HS interaction to FGF2/FGFR signaling may be limited.

Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)regulates signal transduction by forming complexes with its receptors, FGF receptors (FGFRs), and heparan sulfate (HS), playing a crucial role in biological systems. Although HS has been suggested to modulate FGF/FGFR signaling as a coreceptor, multiple hypotheses exist regarding how HS affects FGF/FGFR signaling and the mechanism remains unclear. Herein, to highlight the role of FGF2/HS interaction in FGF2/FGFR1 signaling, FGF2 mutants with reduced HS&#8208;binding affinity are rationally designed through in silico analysis. These FGF2 mutants exhibit reduced HS affinity by more than two orders of magnitude while maintaining binding affinity to FGFR1. In addition, these mutants retain their thermal stability. Cellular assays using the FGF2 mutant suggest that, contrary to previous reports, the contribution of the FGF2/HS interaction in FGF2/FGFR1 signaling may be limited. The mutant FGFs that specifically alter the interaction with HS, achieved in this study, would contribute to an understanding of the role of FGF/HS interaction in FGF/FGFR signaling.

         <title>Improving the Gastric Resilience of Ferritin Nanocages by Fabrication with Gelatin for the Development of Oral Iron Supplements</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gelatin fabrication improved the structural stability and iron retention capacity of frog M ferritins under simulated gastric conditions.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most common nutritional deficiency in the world, particularly affecting children and women. The first&#8208;line treatment for IDA is oral iron supplementation, preferred for its cost&#8208;effectiveness and convenience of administration but is often accompanied by side effects like oxidative stress, infections, and low&#8208;solubility/precipitation. This study explores the use of ferritins&#8212;self&#8208;assembled nanocage proteins serving as soluble cellular&#8208;iron reservoirs&#8212;as a safer alternative for oral iron intervention. Ideal oral iron supplements must withstand gastric conditions, not trigger oxidative stress, and reach the absorption site intact. DNA protection assays and microbial growth studies demonstrate the antioxidative properties of ferritin, contrary to ferrous salts, underscoring its potential as a safer iron supplement. While ferritin shows commendable gastric tolerance, prolonged exposure can hamper its structural integrity/mineral retention. To further enhance its stability, ferritin is fabricated with gelatins, which preserved its structure/iron content under simulated gastric conditions. The combination of inherent antioxidant and controlled iron release properties of ferritin with gelatin's protective effect could help overcome the limitations of the commercial supplements. The findings of this study could pave the way for the development of "gelatin&#8208;coated iron&#8208;loaded ferritin"&#8208;based oral formulations as a safer option for IDA management.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Mediated Base Pairs in Nucleic Acids: Selective Coordination to Natural and Thiocarbonyl&#8208;Modified Cytosines Dependent upon the Oxidation State of Gold</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective coordination of gold ions to mismatched cytosines in nucleic acid duplexes is achieved via oxidation&#8208;state&#8208;dependent interactions. While Au(I) binds to natural cytosine&#8211;cytosine pairs, cytosine thiolation promotes square&#8208;planar coordination with Au(III), offering a structure&#8208;guided approach to redox&#8208;tunable nucleic acid architectures.

Gold&#8208;mediated base pairing in nucleic acids has remained poorly understood, despite structural analogies with mercury and silver ions known to coordinate selectively to mismatched base pairs. Here, the crystal structures of a C&#63743;Au(I)&#63743;C base pair and a C&#63743;G&#63743;Au(I)&#63743;C base triple formed with natural nucleobases are reported. Although solution&#8208;phase thermodynamic analysis of Au(I) coordination is technically unfeasible, structural evidence supports its selective insertion into the base&#160;mismatches. In contrast, duplexes incorporating 2&#8208;thiocytosine form square&#8208;planar complexes with Au(III), and melting temperature analysis shows significant thermal stabilization. The distinct coordination geometries of Au(I) and Au(III) arise from differences in oxidation state and preferred coordination numbers, with Au(I) favoring linear two&#8208;coordinate structures and Au(III) forming square&#8208;planar complexes stabilized by thiocarbonyl donors.

     alt="Gold-Mediated Base Pairs in Nucleic Acids: Selective Coordination to Natural and Thiocarbonyl-Modified Cytosines Dependent upon the Oxidation State of Gold"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selective coordination of gold ions to mismatched cytosines in nucleic acid duplexes is achieved via oxidation-state-dependent interactions. While Au(I) binds to natural cytosine&#8211;cytosine pairs, cytosine thiolation promotes square-planar coordination with Au(III), offering a structure-guided approach to redox-tunable nucleic acid architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold-mediated base pairing in nucleic acids has remained poorly understood, despite structural analogies with mercury and silver ions known to coordinate selectively to mismatched base pairs. Here, the crystal structures of a C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;Au(I)&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;C base pair and a C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;G&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;Au(I)&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;C base triple formed with natural nucleobases are reported. Although solution-phase thermodynamic analysis of Au(I) coordination is technically unfeasible, structural evidence supports its selective insertion into the base&#160;mismatches. In contrast, duplexes incorporating 2-thiocytosine form square-planar complexes with Au(III), and melting temperature analysis shows significant thermal stabilization. The distinct coordination geometries of Au(I) and Au(III) arise from differences in oxidation state and preferred coordination numbers, with Au(I) favoring linear two-coordinate structures and Au(III) forming square-planar complexes stabilized by thiocarbonyl donors. These findings establish a structure-guided strategy for oxidation-state-selective metal coordination in nucleic acids, paving the way for the design of metal-responsive DNA architectures with tunable properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Hydrogenases catalyze reversible H2 production and are potential models for renewable energy catalysts. Here, the full redox landscape of a group 3 [NiFe]&#8208;hydrogenase from methanothermococcus thermolithotrophicus is elucidated, resembling group 1 enzymes.

         <title>C&#8208;6&#8208;Modified 2&#8208;F&#8208;Fucose Derivatives as Inhibitors of Fucosyltransferases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of C6&#8208;modified guanosine&#8208;diphosphate&#8208;2&#8208;F&#8208;fucose analogs and corresponding prodrugs are designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated as inhibitors of cellular fucosylation. Certain analogs potently inhibit fucosyltransferases (FUT) FUT1, 3, 6, and 9 while showing minimal activity for FUT8, highlighting the potential for selective FUT targeting.

Fluorinated analogs of guanosine&#8208;diphosphate&#8208;&#946;&#8208;L&#8208;fucose (GDP&#8208;Fuc) have received considerable attention for the development of inhibitors of fucosyltransferases (FUTs). These compounds can be recognized by FUTs but do not transfer or transfer slowly the fluorinated fucosyl residue because the electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorine(s) destabilize the oxocarbenium&#8208;like transition state. Fluorinated GDP&#8208;Fuc analogs can also act as feedback inhibitor of the de novo biosynthetic pathway of GDP&#8208;Fuc. To investigate the biological significance of distinct glycoconjugate classes, it is important to develop inhibitors that can selectively target specific FUT enzymes. The design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a series of GDP&#8208;2&#8208;F&#8208;Fuc analogs modified at C&#8208;6 of Fuc by various amides and ethers are reported. Corresponding prodrugs are also prepared and examined as potential FUT inhibitors of cellular glycosylation. The findings reveal that two of the inhibitors potently inhibited FUT1, 3, 6, and 9, while displaying minimal activity against FUT8. However, the corresponding prodrugs do not inhibit cellular fucosylation, which is probably due to a lack of GDP&#8208;fucose pyrophosphorylase activity. The results demonstrate that modifications at the C&#8208;6 position of Fuc can confer selectivity, although further investigations of alternative functional groups are required to enhance cellular tolerance and efficacy.

         <title>Interactions of Neurodegenerative Disease Positron Emission Tomography Imaging Probe Candidates with the C&#8208;Terminus of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Fibrils</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binding studies of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;S) fibril ligands using photo&#8208;crosslinking mass spectrometry and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer show that the multiple system atrophy (MSA)&#8208;selective lead, HY&#8208;215, interacts with the &#945;S C&#8208;terminus, unlike Parkinson's disease (PD)&#8208;selective lead, M503. Thus, often&#8208;ignored interactions with the disordered regions of &#945;S fibrils may be important in the development of positron emission tomography imaging probes and other therapeutic small molecules for PD and MSA.

Fibrillar aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;S) is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) and related disorders, including multiple system atrophy (MSA) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Herein, the fibril interactions of two candidate positron emission tomography (PET) imaging ligands, M503 and HY&#8208;215, being developed for imaging of PD/DLB and MSA, respectively, are investigated. Photo&#8208;crosslinking mass spectrometry is used to determine the sites of their binding to in&#8201;vitro fibrils, and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer with fluorescently labeled proteins is used to analyze conformational changes in the disordered &#945;S C&#8208;terminus. Taken together, these studies show that the MSA&#8208;selective PET lead, HY&#8208;215, interacts with the C&#8208;terminus, unlike the PD&#8208;selective lead M503. This study indicates that interactions with the often&#8208;ignored disordered regions of &#945;S fibrils should be considered in the development of PET probes and other therapeutic small molecules.

         <title>Toxicity of Antisense Oligonucleotides is Determined by the Synergistic Interplay of Chemical Modifications and Nucleotide Sequences, Not by Either Factor Alone</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) hold promise for precise RNA modulation but face major toxicity challenges. Traditional optimization treats sequence and chemistry separately, relying on limited chemistries or costly trial&#8208;and&#8208;error screens. This study reveals ASO toxicity arises from the synergistic interplay of sequence, chemical modifications, and positional context&#8212;underscoring the need for rational, integrated design strategies to develop safe, effective ASO therapeutics.

Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) offer a promising therapeutic approach for precise RNA&#8208;level gene modulation. Despite advancements in chemical modifications to enhance stability and pharmacokinetics, ASOs still face significant challenges, including liver, immunological, renal, and neurological toxicities, potentially leading to high preclinical failure rates. Current oligonucleotide&#8208;based drug optimization strategies to overcome such issues often rely on applying a few commonly used chemical architectures (patterns of linker, sugar, or base modifications), which are conventional in the field, or engaging in expensive and time&#8208;consuming trial&#8208;and&#8208;error screening processes involving both sequence changes and positional chemical modifications. These traditional approaches treat nucleotide sequences (&#8220;sequence&#8221;) and sugar/linkage modification chemistries (&#8220;chemistry&#8221;) as independent contributors to toxicity. However, ample evidence in the literature shows that even minor changes in either sequence or chemical modifications can drastically impact toxicity, suggesting an inseparable synergistic relationship between sequence and chemistry. In support of this sequence&#8208;chemistry collusion thesis, this manuscript presents a survey of the systemic toxicity potential of several chemically modified gapmer ASOs by investigating the impact of modifying sugar and backbone chemistries on ASO&#8208;induced hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and immune/inflammatory responses. The data unequivocally demonstrate that ASO toxicity is strongly influenced by the interplay between nucleotide sequence, chemical modifications, and the specific position context of those modifications, highlighting the critical need to rationally engineer the optimal sequence and chemical composition to develop safe and active ASO drug candidates instead of discovering suboptimal ASOs through trial&#8208;and&#8208;error screening campaigns.

Studies conducted since the late 1990s show substantial activity of selected citrus flavonoids as cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) membrane protein activators. The thesis of this work is that aptly formulated citrus flavonoids hold sigificant potential for developing a multitarget treatment of cystic fibrosis combining in a single treatment antimicrobial, anti&#8208;inflammatory, CFTR&#8208;stimulating, and immunomodulatory properties, as required by a genetic disease eventually causing chronic lung inflammation and bacterial infection reinforcing each other.

&lt;p&gt;Studies conducted since the late 1990s show substantial activity of selected citrus flavonoids as cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) membrane protein activators. The thesis of this work is that aptly formulated citrus flavonoids hold sigificant potential for developing a multitarget treatment of cystic fibrosis combining in a single treatment antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, CFTR-stimulating, and immunomodulatory properties, as required by a genetic disease eventually causing chronic lung inflammation and bacterial infection reinforcing each other.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Rieske Oxygenase&#8208;Catalyzed Biotransformations in Recombinant Cupriavidus necator Fueled by Formate Oxidation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, formatotrophic biotransformations in recombinant Cupriavidus necator catalyzed by Rieske oxygenases (ROs) toward various oxyfunctionalized olefins are demonstrated. The oxidation of formate regenerates NADH, the ROs&#8217; cofactor, essentially fueling the reaction. The formatotrophically cultivated cells performed at the same efficiency as heterotrophically grown cells of the same strain. NDO: naphthalene dioxygenase, CDO: cumene dioxygenase. CBB cycle: Calvin&#8208;Benson&#8208;Bassham cycle.

The use of single carbon (C1) molecules, such as carbon dioxide or formate, is crucial in the transition from a linear, petroleum&#8208;based economy to a circular bioeconomy. Formate can serve as both a carbon and energy source, further enhancing its attractiveness as a feedstock. Cupriavidus necator, a lithoautotrophic microbial chassis strain, provides an opportunity to leverage formate for the synthesis of valuable products. However, its ability to grow on formate and the subsequent coupling of that process to recombinantly produced redox enzymes for the efficient production of high&#8208;value&#8208;added products in a biotransformation has not yet been established. Here, we report the development of a formate&#8208;driven C. necator whole&#8208;cell chassis that recombinantly produces Rieske oxygenases (ROs) and elaborate on possible stress responses of the cells during formatotrophic cultivation. The whole&#8208;cell chassis efficiently catalyzes the oxyfunctionalization of olefins fueled by formate oxidation. For instance, styrene is dihydroxylated to (R)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diol in an excellent 95% yield and with good enantioselectivity (74% ee) under formatotrophic conditions. The product yield and optical purity obtained demonstrate the synthetic usefulness of formate&#8208;fueled whole&#8208;cell bio&#8208;transformations in C. necator.

         <title>Model&#8208;Based Optimization of Fed&#8208;Batch In Vitro Transcription</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a mathematical model for the enzyme kinetics and solution thermodynamics of the in vitro transcription reaction, new optimized strategies are developed for fed&#8208;batch transcription that can decrease the resource costs of mRNA synthesis while maintaining critical quality attributes for efficacy in vivo.

Recent developments in RNA vaccines and therapeutics have motivated the need for process engineering strategies to optimize the in vitro transcription (IVT) reaction for RNA synthesis. Specifically, practitioners seek to maximize the production of RNA and the incorporation of the 5&#8208;prime cap to the end of each RNA molecule while minimizing the use of expensive reagents. Fed&#8208;batch IVT is a promising technique for achieving these goals but is difficult to optimize by purely experimental means. Herein, a mechanistic model for fed&#8208;batch IVT is developed and it is used to develop optimized fed&#8208;batch protocols to maximize the formation of RNA while controlling concentrations of nucleoside triphosphates. On a model sequence that has been shown to be sensitive to salt concentrations, this approach can produce twice as much RNA as a heuristic approach. In addition, it is observed and characterized for the first time the formation of magnesium phosphate crystals during the IVT reaction. Strategies informed by thermodynamic modeling are developed to prevent this undesired crystallization during fed&#8208;batch IVT. Finally, co&#8208;transcriptional capping is incorporated into the model&#8208;based optimization approach and a strategy to maximize RNA formation is developed while maintaining a high level of 5&#8208;prime cap incorporation and minimizing the use of cap analogs.

         <title>Ratiometric Detection of pH&#8208;Induced i&#8208;Motif Folding Based on a Dual Emissive Cytosine Analog</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;emissive cytosine analog enables ratiometric fluorescence detection of i&#8208;motif DNA folding. This study reveals a sensitive method to monitor pH&#8208;dependent i&#8208;motif conformational changes, providing a valuable tool for investigating DNA secondary structures in&#8201;vitro.

A dual&#8208;emissive cytosine analog (TCC), based on a 2&#8208;thienyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxychromone scaffold, is incorporated into oligodeoxynucleotides to monitor the folding state of DNA i&#8208;motif structures. This modified nucleobase exhibits two distinct emission bands (IN* and IT*), each responding differently to microenvironmental changes, enabling ratiometric detection. The photophysical properties of TCC are systematically characterized in various solvents and DNA contexts, including single&#8208;stranded, double&#8208;stranded, and i&#8208;motif&#8208;forming sequences. The IN*/IT* emission ratio and the wavelength of the IT* band act as robust and orthogonal reporters of hydration, base stacking, and protonation states. In fully paired duplexes, the T* band is quenched and blue&#8208;shifted, while i&#8208;motif folding results in both fluorescence enhancement and a redshift of the T* emission. Additionally, the probe distinguishes mismatched base pairs and abasic sites, offering further insights into local structural defects. Overall, this ratiometric nucleobase analog enables real&#8208;time, multiparametric monitoring of i&#8208;motif folding with high sensitivity, and holds promise for extension to other noncanonical DNA structures. The findings further establish the 3&#8208;hydroxychromone platform as a powerful tool for the rational design of fluorescent sensors targeting dynamic nucleic acid architectures.

         <title>5&#8208;Thiohistidine N&#8208;Acetyltransferase from Proteiniphilum Saccharofermentans</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteiniphilum saccharofermentans, a Gram&#8208;negative facultative anaerobe, produces an N&#8208;acetyl transferase (5THNAT) that acetylates 5&#8208;thiohistidine using acetyl&#8208;CoA. This reaction competes with OvoC&#8208;mediated N&#960;&#8208;methylation of the same substrate. The production ratio of ovothiol to N&#945;&#8208;acetyl 5&#8208;thiohistidine is likely regulated by the relative availability of SAM and acetyl&#8208;CoA.

Ovothiol A is a 5&#8208;thiohistidine derivative biosynthesized by a broad range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Its redox&#8208;active mercaptoimidazole side chain is believed to protect cells from oxidative stress. The three enzymes that produce ovothiol A from histidine, cysteine, and S&#8208;adenosyl methionine have been identified and characterized. In contrast, no enzymes are known that produce other 5&#8208;thiohistidine derivatives. Here, a small family of acetyl&#8208;coenzyme A&#8208;dependent transferases is described that produce N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;5&#8208;thiohistidine. The discovery of these enzymes from Proteiniphilum saccharofermentans and related Bacteroidota provides evidence that the 5&#8208;thiohistidine class may be structurally and functionally more diverse than previously thought.

         <title>A Selenylation&#8208;Isocyanation&#8208;Amine Addition Strategy Targeting Prenylated Derivatives to Disrupt Oncogenic Rat Sarcoma Level</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein prenylation has gained significant interest recently due to its important role in cellular signaling pathways. Herein, we introduce our innovative strategy for selenylation&#8208;isocyanation, which targets prenyl functionalities in the first step. We then employ a range of amine&#8208;functionalized probes, including fluorescent, biotinylated, and other probes, allowing for fluorescent labeling, chemical pulldowns, and regulation of prenylated biomolecules (termed SIA&#8208;Tag).

In recent years, significant strides have been made in protein prenylation research, a critical post&#8208;translational modification essential for modulating cellular signaling. Central to this advancement is the selenylation&#8208;isocyanation&#8208;amine Addition strategy, which employs amine&#8208;functionalized fluorescent or biotin&#8208;tagged probes to selectively label or isolate prenylated molecules. Herein, Rat Sarcoma (RAS) protein regulation in HCT116 cell lines through the development of a novel prenylation labeling method is investigated. This approach provides insights into the functional dynamics of prenylated proteins and enables targeted manipulation of these molecules. While this work primarily establishes a methodological advance, it lays the foundation for future studies to elucidate RAS&#8208;related oncogenic signaling pathways and explore therapeutic strategies targeting prenylation&#8208;dependent processes.

Herein, we introduce our innovative strategy for selenylation-isocyanation, which targets prenyl functionalities in the first step. We then employ a range of amine-functionalized probes, including fluorescent, biotinylated, and other probes, allowing for fluorescent labeling, chemical pulldowns, and regulation of prenylated biomolecules (termed SIA-Tag).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, significant strides have been made in protein prenylation research, a critical post-translational modification essential for modulating cellular signaling. Central to this advancement is the selenylation-isocyanation-amine Addition strategy, which employs amine-functionalized fluorescent or biotin-tagged probes to selectively label or isolate prenylated molecules. Herein, Rat Sarcoma (RAS) protein regulation in HCT116 cell lines through the development of a novel prenylation labeling method is investigated. This approach provides insights into the functional dynamics of prenylated proteins and enables targeted manipulation of these molecules. While this work primarily establishes a methodological advance, it lays the foundation for future studies to elucidate RAS-related oncogenic signaling pathways and explore therapeutic strategies targeting prenylation-dependent processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functionalizing Injectable Hydrogels with Cobalt&#8208;Based Metallacarboranes for Targeted Delivery in Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a biocompatible HA&#8211;lysine hydrogel loaded with cobalt metallacarborane (CoSAN) for targeted release into triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cells. The system maintains CoSAN cytotoxicity, as confirmed by cell assays and imaging, representing an attractive approach toward a localised TNBC treatment.

Cobalt&#8208;based metallacarboranes have emerged as potential candidates for cancer treatment owing to their unique structural properties. In this study, a biocompatible delivery platform is developed by noncovalently incorporating cobalt metallacarborane (CoSAN) into hyaluronic acid (HA) functionalized with lysine (Lys). HA&#8208;Lys 2 enables the electrostatic interaction of CoSAN while retaining its cytotoxic activity, as confirmed by cellular assays using MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cells. Elemental mapping via energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the successful and homogeneous incorporation of CoSAN to lead HA&#8208;Lys&#8208;CoSAN 3, and the composite is further characterized using diffusion&#8208;ordered nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (DOSY). Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy data demonstrate comparable cellular uptake in MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells of free and HA&#8208;loaded CoSAN. Additionally, release studies under physiologically relevant conditions show a sustained release profile over 24&#8201;h with pH dependency to mimic normal and tumor microenvironments. The present study describes a viable method for integrating metallacarboranes into a polymeric drug delivery system without compromising their anticancer properties, thereby advancing their potential for future therapeutic use.

         <title>Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Delivery of siRNA by Amphiphilic Nanovectors Self&#8208;Assembled from a Cationic [4]Helicene&#8208;Squalene Ester</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small amphiphilic helicene effectively complexes siRNA, leading to nanoassemblies which transport siRNA to the mitochondria where it silences the protein expression of the mitochondria&#8208;encoded cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene. 

The active delivery of therapeutic nucleic acids with subcellular precision is an open challenge. Herein, a small conjugate molecule, combining a cationic [4]helicene moiety with a lipophilic squalene tail, yields amphiphilic nanoassemblies capable of effectively complexing siRNA within the mitochondria. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept in HCT 116 colorectal cancer cells was evidenced by Western blot for the delivery of siRNA silencing the protein expression of the mitochondria&#8208;encoded cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene.

         <title>ThiF&#8208;Like Enzyme Chemistry in Primary and Secondary Metabolism</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ThiF&#8208;like enzymes are a widespread protein family found in disparate biosynthetic pathways. They are unified by their use of an NTP to modify a carboxylate, generating an activated species prone to nucleophilic addition. This common intermediate is then targeted by diverse nucleophiles, including persulfide or amino acid side chains, to yield a variety of structural scaffolds. This review highlights the diversity of chemical modifications made by the ThiF&#8208;like enzyme family, ranging from its involvement in the biosynthesis of universal enzyme cofactors to the formation of exotic bioactive RiPP natural product scaffolds.

ThiF&#8208;like proteins are members of the widespread E1&#8208;like enzyme superfamily. The eponymous ThiF enzyme was first described in thiamin biosynthesis as part of Escherichia coli's primary metabolism, and homologous proteins have been subsequently discovered in secondary metabolism. These ThiF&#8208;like enzymes are united in their defining ability to perform nucleotidylation of a carboxyl group to generate an activated, electrophilic intermediate, a feature it shares with the structurally related ubiquitin&#8208;activating enzymes. From here, an array of different nucleophiles are used across distinct biosynthetic pathways to yield diverse structural scaffolds. In this review, we discuss various ThiF&#8208;like enzymes that perform nucleotidylation to facilitate a diverse array of interesting and rare chemistry on different types of substrates, as well as showcase some of the shared structural features.

         <title>Reaction Engineering of In Vitro Natural Product Biosynthesis: Challenges and Strategies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The yield and turnover of in vitro natural product biosynthesis, and even its feasibility, are determined by intermolecular interactions. Reaction engineering allows to improve the performance of such complex biocatalytic systems.

Natural products are widely used as pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, or as active ingredients in food and cosmetics. Their biosynthesis typically involves a series of enzyme&#8208;controlled reactions in dedicated liquid environments. The reconstruction of these multistep transformations under in vitro conditions bears significant potential for technical utilization. However, the concurrent operation of multiple enzymes in a single reaction flask or reactor is often associated with major challenges. Herein, the difficulties in reaching high substrate conversion and product yields with in vitro enzyme cascades are summarized. Furthermore, both established and emerging concepts for improving their performance are discussed.

         <title>Glycosaminoglycans as Polyelectrolytes: Charge, Interactions, and Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linear, anionic biopolymers with their functions tightly linked to their charge. This review approaches GAGs from a polyelectrolyte perspective, shedding light on how the distribution of sulfate groups and, thus, negative charges, governs their interactions with other biomolecules. Understanding these charge&#8208;driven principles enables their understanding, analysis, and the design of GAG&#8208;based or GAG&#8208;mimetic materials.

Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linear, negatively charged biopolymers that modulate complex biological processes, such as blood coagulation, immune regulation, or viral entry. Their sulfation pattern and chain length govern how strongly they bind to other physiologically relevant species. Most of these interactions rely on electrostatic forces facilitated by the strong polyanionic properties of GAGs; therefore, considering these from a polyelectrolyte vantage point can help understand how such charge&#8208;based, often transient interactions contribute to physiological and pathological processes. While the different GAG classes share key electrostatic properties, they exhibit unique structural features that shape their function. Here, it is highlighted on how modern separation and analytical tools exploit the polyanionic character of GAGs to dissect subtle structural details. For these, the fundamental description of their charge&#8211;charge interactions is crucial. With this knowledge, modified GAGs, synthetic GAG mimetics, or GAG&#8208;binding molecules can be designed that replicate or refine their key properties and show promise for therapeutic and biomedical applications. Altogether, recognizing the importance of GAGs as polyelectrolytes provides vital knowledge on how their charge distribution mediates crucial biomolecular interactions in health and disease, and thus it helps complete our knowledge on fundamentally important biopolymers.

         <title>Recent Advances in P450 Enzyme Engineering for the Production of Natural Products</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept focuses on the advances in natural product synthesis using P450s, covering the applied strategies through cofactor engineering, redox partner engineering, and enzyme engineering, along with recent applications. It also outlines current technical bottlenecks and future development directions.

Natural products exhibit a wide range of biological activities and are the crucial resources for drug development and compound modification. Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s, CYP) are a class of multifunctional and stereoselective biocatalysts that utilize heme as a cofactor and can be employed in the biosynthesis of natural products. With the development of biotechnology, P450s have been widely applied in the synthesis of natural products. However, several challenges still exist during the catalytic process, including the difficulties in the soluble expression of P450s, the insufficient supply of cofactor heme, the limited substrate selectivity, and the low efficiency of electron transfer. This concept systematically summarizes recent advances in P450 enzyme engineering for the synthesis of natural products. It covers the engineering strategies to improve heme supply and enhance the catalytic efficiency for various P450 enzymes and their applications in synthesizing steroids, flavonoids, alkaloids, and terpenoids. This concept provides a foundation for overcoming catalytic bottlenecks and promoting the green biomanufacturing of high&#8208;value natural products.

         <title>Oleanolic Acid Amide Derivatives as 20s Proteasome Stimulators</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteasome stimulation is of high interest for its applications in clearing protein accumulation. This study investigates oleanolic acid, a pentacyclic triterpenoid natural product proteasome stimulator, through a structure&#8211;activity relationship campaign. These findings suggest that para&#8208;substituted benzyl amides and isopropyl amides at C28 increase proteasome stimulation.

Oleanolic acid (OA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid natural product, is previously identified as a proteasome stimulator using purified proteasome. Structure&#8211;activity relationship studies are carried out on OA at the C28 and C3 positions to determine if modifications at these positions can change proteasome stimulation activity. Ten amide derivatives are synthesized and tested in cells. These findings indicate that replacing the carboxylic acid with an amide at position C28 does not diminish the stimulating effect, with certain functional groups making stimulation more potent. Amides with increased steric hinderance stimulate the proteasome the best, particularly amides with ortho substituted benzyl or isopropyl moieties. OA is further derivatized at the C3 position by acylating the hydroxyl group. Changes at this position affect solubility of the derivatives, but do not dramatically diminish proteasome stimulation. These modifications highlight that the structure of OA can be modified to include linkers or covalent cross&#8208;linking moieties to expand upon the available proteasome probes.

         <title>Design and Characterization of the Fusion Enzyme of Bovine Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase and DNA Binding Protein Sso7d from Sulfolobus solfataricus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fusion of the DNA&#8208;binding protein Sso7d from Sulfolobus solfataricus with bovine DNA exotransferase results in a threefold increase in DNA&#8208;binding affinity to double&#8208;stranded DNA, enhances expression yield, and improves thermostability, along with altering functional activity. The obtained fusion enzymes serve as promising candidates for novel applications, including gene editing, mutagenesis studies, and aptamer engineering.

The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase is a unique polymerase that incorporates nucleotides at the 3&#8242;&#8208;terminus of single&#8208;stranded DNA primers in a template&#8208;independent manner. This biological function propels the development of numerous biomedical and bioengineering applications. However, the extensive use of TdT is constrained by its low expression levels in E. coli and low optimal operating temperature. To address these limitations, a fusion enzyme combining TdT and the DNA&#8208;binding protein Sso7d from Sulfolobus solfataricus is designed and isolated. This fusion protein exhibits a threefold increase in DNA&#8208;binding affinity to double&#8208;stranded DNA and demonstrates improved thermostability, denaturing at temperatures up to 48&#8201;&#176;C, along with an enhancement in the expression yield of the target protein. The fusion of Sso7d to the C&#8208;terminus of TdT enhances catalytic activity for nucleotide removal from the coding end, while completely abolishing nucleotide addition activity. Conversely, the presence of Sso7d at the N&#8208;terminus of TdT decreases nucleotide incorporation and enhances nucleotide removal activity, with this effect significantly influenced by substrate length and the presence of metal ions in the reaction mixture. Overall, the obtained fusion enzymes could serve as promising candidates for novel specific applications, such as gene editing, mutagenesis studies, and aptamer engineering.

         <title>A Nucleotide&#8208;Derived Fluorophore for Visualizing G&#8208;Quadruplex Assembly and Introduction of Cation&#8208;Regulated Activity into the Thrombin Binding Aptamer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial analog of nucleotides, 7,8&#8208;dihydro&#8208;8&#8208;oxo&#8208;1, N6&#8208;ethenoadenine, increases aptamer affinity, introduces cation regulation of affinity, and traces aptamer structure folding.

Nucleic acid aptamers are artificial recognition elements with great potential in biotechnology. For their effective integration into nanodevices, rational strategies for optimizing aptamer affinity and regulating activity are essential. Artificial nucleotide analogs offer versatile tools for both fundamental and applied research in the aptamer field. Herein, the affinity of a thrombin&#8208;binding aptamer is increased tenfold through a single nucleotide modification with 7,8&#8208;dihydro&#8208;8&#8208;oxo&#8208;1, N6&#8208;ethenoadenine (oxo&#8208;&#949;A) introduced at either the 4th or 13th position. Normally, thymines in these positions form a T:T base pair, which is broken during the thrombin binding. A double oxo&#8208;&#949;A modification at both the 4th and 13th positions resulted in Ag+&#8208;dependence of aptamer activity. Ag+ ions formed a noncanonical oxo&#8208;&#949;A:Ag+2:oxo&#8208;&#949;A pair, mimicking the T:T pair found in the unmodified aptamer, which is a crucial part of the thrombin recognition interface. The intrinsic fluorescence of oxo&#8208;&#949;A is used to investigate conformational rearrangements in the loops during G&#8208;quadruplex (GQ) folding. The rapid kinetics of aptamer folding are captured using a stopped&#8208;flow fluorimeter. The dissociation constants are estimated for the aptamer complexes with K+, Na+, and Ag+, revealing the tiny influence of the modifications on GQ&#160;folding.

         <title>Indomethacin&#8208;Naphthalimide&#8208;Based AIEgen for Illuminating Golgi Apparatus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small molecule library is designed and synthesized for showing aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), among which one small molecule consisting of indomethacin, napthalimide&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl aniline, and amide linkage is identified to illuminate Golgi apparatus in cells. Quantum mechanical calculations, electron microscopy, and light scattering confirm the self&#8208;assembly of this novel molecule into nanoscale material.

Golgi apparatus (GA) is a complex organelle controlling subcellular protein modifications, sorting, and transport. Dysregulation in GA leads to cancer development and metastasis. Consequently, development of small molecule fluorophores for illuminating GA in cancer cells remains a major challenge. To address this, herein, a small molecule library of four aggregation&#8208;induced emissive probes (AIEgens) is designed and synthesized, having (a) indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug (NSAID) for GA homing; (b) 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted aniline as AIE inducer; and (c) amide/ester linkage between NSAID and AIE inducer. All the library members exhibited excellent AIE property in THF/water binary solvent systems through self&#8208;assembly in water. Interestingly, one of the library members (compound 13), consisting of napthalimide&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl aniline as AIE inducer and amide linkage, efficiently homes into the GA of HCT&#8208;116 colon cancer cells within 30&#8201;min and self&#8208;assembled into 2D nanoscale materials, as shown by scanning electron and atomic force microscopy and confirmed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Moreover, quantum mechanical calculations revealed intramolecular charge transfer (CT) between N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl aniline (donor) and naphthalimide (acceptor) as the underlying mechanism of the photophysical properties of compound 13. This novel AIEgen can serve as a chemical biology tool to visualize GA in cancer cells for next&#8208;generation cancer therapeutics.

Consequently, development of small molecule fluorophores for illuminating GA in cancer cells remains a major challenge. To address this, herein, a small molecule library of four aggregation-induced emissive probes (AIEgens) is designed and synthesized, having (a) indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for GA homing; (b) 1,8-naphthalimide-N,N&#8242;-disubstituted aniline as AIE inducer; and (c) amide/ester linkage between NSAID and AIE inducer. All the library members exhibited excellent AIE property in THF/water binary solvent systems through self-assembly in water. Interestingly, one of the library members (compound 13), consisting of napthalimide-N,N&#8242;-dimethyl aniline as AIE inducer and amide linkage, efficiently homes into the GA of HCT-116 colon cancer cells within 30&#8201;min and self-assembled into 2D nanoscale materials, as shown by scanning electron and atomic force microscopy and confirmed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Moreover, quantum mechanical calculations revealed intramolecular charge transfer (CT) between N,N&#8242;-dimethyl aniline (donor) and naphthalimide (acceptor) as the underlying mechanism of the photophysical properties of compound 13. This novel AIEgen can serve as a chemical biology tool to visualize GA in cancer cells for next-generation cancer therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Linear Arginoketides Neotetrafibricin A, B, and C have Algicidal and Signal Function in Microbial Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study highlights the effect of the linear arginoketides neotetrafibricins on microorganisms. Structure&#8211;activity relationship analyses revealed that structural elements as the sugar moiety are not essential and presence of a guanidino or an amino group are interchangeable for bioactivity because the neotetrafibricin congeners described exhibited similar algicidal activity and signaling function towards a filamentous fungus.

Soils harbor some of the most diverse microbiomes on Earth. Interactions within these microbial communities are often mediated by natural products, many functioning as chemical signals. Specialized metabolites known as arginoketides, or arginine&#8208;derived polyketides, have been linked to mediate these interactions. However, the effect of linear arginoketides on soil microalgae has not yet been investigated. Here, we report that Streptomyces mashuensis DSM40221 produces the linear arginoketide neotetrafibricin A, and show that it exhibits algicidal activity against the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and induces production of orsellinic acid and derivatives encoded by the silent ors biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans. Thus, neotetrafibricin serves as an inter&#8208;kingdom signaling molecule. Genome mining identified the neotetrafibricin BGC in S. mashuensis. Disrupting the first polyketide synthase gene abolished neotetrafibricin production. Further mutational studies identified two neotetrafibricin congeners, including the novel neotetrafibricin C, which contains a terminal guanidino group. Structure&#8211;activity relationship analyses revealed that neither the terminal amino group nor the sugar moiety is essential for its algicidal activity or the induction of the ors BGC in the fungus. These findings expand the understanding of linear arginoketides in microbial ecology and highlight their potential as multifunctional signaling compounds in soil environments.

         <title>Screening the Irish Marine Biorepository Identifies a New Bryostatin Analog as Potent Inhibitor of Activated B&#8208;Cells Diffuse Large B&#8208;Cell Lymphoma</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bryostatin analogs are found to be accumulated in the nudibranch Antiopella cristata collected in Irish waters. These are found to be potent inhibitors of activated B&#8208;cells diffuse large B&#8208;cell lymphoma.

Activated B&#8208;cell diffuse large B&#8208;cell lymphoma (ABC&#8208;DLBCL) is an aggressive cancer with poor response to standard chemotherapy. In search of new therapeutic leads, a library of 435 fractions prepared from the Irish marine biorepository was screened against 2 ABC&#8208;DLBCL cell lines (TMD8 and OCI&#8208;Ly10) and a non&#8208;cancerous control cell line (CB33). Active fractions are prioritized based on potency and selectivity. Among them, fractions from the nudibranch Antiopella cristata and the ascidian Diplosoma listerianum exhibit the most potent and selective cytotoxicity. Bioassay&#8208;guided fractionation of D. listerianum led to the identification of the known loliolide and epiloliolide. On the other hand, A. cristata yielded several bryostatin analogs, including bryostatin 13 and a new natural product, its 18&#8208;demethylated analog. Both compounds demonstrated nanomolar cytotoxicity against ABC&#8208;DLBCL cell lines with minimal activity in CB33. Transcriptomic profiling showed significant gene expression changes, particularly for the 18&#8208;demethylated analog, implicating modulation of key signaling pathways. This study identifies A. cristata as a novel and highly enriched source of bioactive bryostatins and supports the dietary sequestration hypothesis in nudibranchs, highlighting the value of marine invertebrates as reservoirs of selective anticancer agents for drug discovery.

         <title>Homogeneous Electrochemical Enzyme&#8208;Linked Immunosorbent Assay Strategy Based On pH&#8208;Mediated Redox Potential Regulation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homogeneous electrochemical enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay platform is developed, which simplifies and accelerates signal acquisition in field settings. Target&#8208;induced pH change is carefully investigated. Highly sensitive, reproducible, and quantitative electrochemical detection is achieved with C&#8208;reactive protein as a model target.

Enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is widely recognized as the gold standard for protein detection. However, its reliance on expensive and bulky optical instruments limits its use in point&#8208;of&#8208;care and resource&#8208;limited settings. Electrochemical technique emerges as a promising alternative due to its low cost, portability, and simple instrumentation. However, conventional electrochemical methods often require complex surface modifications and suffer from variability between electrodes. To overcome these limitations, a novel homogeneous electrochemical ELISA platform has been developed, that simplifies and accelerates signal acquisition in field settings. This platform leverages pH changes caused by alkaline phosphatase&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of ATP, resulting in solution acidification. These pH variations are sensitively detected through shifts in the redox potential of methylene blue (MB), a proton&#8208;sensitive electrochemical probe. By quantitatively correlating the target protein concentration with MB redox potential shift, a sensitive, reproducible, and quantitative electrochemical detection of a model protein, C&#8208;reactive protein, is achieved. This versatile and cost&#8208;effective approach holds significant potential to expand the applicability of ELISA to point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics.

         <title>Effects on LuxR&#8208;Regulated Bioluminescence of Cyclodextrin&#8208;Acyl&#8208;L&#8208;Homoserine Lactone Hybrids</title>

Cyclodextrin&#8208;N&#8208;acyl&#8208;L&#8208;Homoserine&#8208;Lactone conjugates are synthetized, purified and fully characterized. The study of modulation of LuxR&#8208;regulated bioluminescence production has demonstrated that one of the compounds exhibits not only the capacity to induce bioluminescence with an EC50 value of 64&#8201;&#181;M, but also the ability to reduce bioluminescence with an IC50 value of 10&#8211;20&#8201;&#181;M.

In this work, acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) are grafted, the most studied signaling molecules in many Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, onto cyclodextrins (CDs) by copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition &#8220;click&#8221; coupling between alkynyl&#8208;AHLs and 6&#8208;azido&#8208;CDs derived from &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;CD, native or methylated. Attaching biomolecules onto a CD scaffold is a known strategy to enhance their properties, but designing CD&#8208;AHL conjugates has never been reported. These molecules were fully characterized by NMR and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, and the study of their solubility and conformation reveals significant conformational changes due to the presence of the AHL appendage on the CD structure. One of the hybrids (per&#8208;AHL&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD, 9B) exhibits higher solubility in water than AHL and &#946;&#8208;CD alone. The new CD&#8208;AHLs conjugates are found to modulate bioluminescence in a quorum Sensing LuxR&#8208;regulated light&#8208;producing bacterial model, with significant variations depending on the structure. The per&#8208;AHL&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD, 9B, is found to be the most active compound in the series.

         <title>Mitochondrial ClpX Inhibition Induces Ferroptosis and Blocks Pancreatic Cancer Cell Proliferation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional inhibition of ClpXP induces mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately driving lethal lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Through ATPase&#8208;focused screening, we identified MSC1094308 as a hit compound for ClpX inhibition, recapitulating the effects of CLPX&#8208;knockdown by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis in PDAC cells.

The ATPase caseinolytic protease X (ClpX), forming the ClpXP complex with caseinolytic protease P (ClpP), is essential for mitochondrial protein homeostasis. While ClpP targeting is a recognized anticancer strategy, the role of ClpX in cancer remains underexplored. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), elevated CLPX expression correlates with poor prognosis, suggesting its oncogenic function. CLPX knockdown disrupts mitochondrial homeostasis, and reduces oxidative phosphorylation, thus leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired PDAC cell proliferation. The ClpX&#8208;mediated mitochondrial dysfunction induces oxidative stress, unfolded protein response (UPR), and ferroptosis, which is evidenced by increased reactive oxygen species, ferrous iron, lipid peroxidation, and malondialdehyde levels. Screening ATPase inhibitors identifies MSC1094308 as a hit compound for ClpX inhibition, which suppresses ClpXP activity and induces UPR and ferroptosis in PDAC cells. These findings highlight ClpX inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy for PDAC.

         <title>A Photocaged N&#8208;Phosphonopiperidinone as a Selective Photo&#8208;Cleavable DPP8/9 Inhibitor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocaged inhibitors are versatile biochemical tools for spatiotemporal control of inhibitor activity, facilitating the elucidation of protein function in a cell type&#8208;dependent fashion. Herein, a green light&#8208;cleavable, BODIPY&#8208;photocaged dipeptidyl peptidase 8 and 9 inhibitor with low phototoxicity, pronounced potency, and selectivity is described, thereby demonstrating the benefits of chemical proteomics for inhibitor characterization.

The strategic introduction of photocages into chemical probes represents a powerful approach to generate spatiotemporally controlled tools with promising applications in chemical biology and drug discovery. This approach is particularly useful for inhibitors of proteins with cell&#8208;type&#8208;dependent functions, as they enable, via light&#8208;triggered selection, the study of their function in selected cells within multicellular organisms. The intracellular dipeptidyl peptidases 8 and 9 (DPP8/9) are serine hydrolases that act in a cell type&#8208;dependent fashion, in diverse biological processes such as inflammation and tumorigenesis. So far, no photocaged inhibitors for DPP8/9 are available, thus hampering their systematic investigations in biomedical research model systems such as mice. Herein, the development of a green light&#8208;cleavable, BODIPY&#8208;photocaged N&#8208;phosphono&#8208;piperidone&#8208;based DPP8/9 inhibitor is presented. This covalent&#8208;acting inhibitor is characterized by its photolysis properties, including a demonstration of its low phototoxicity, as well as potency and selectivity, in biochemical, biological, and, as an extension to these traditional validation approaches, chemical proteomics assays. These studies not only reveal the suitability of the developed photocages for cellular applications, as a prerequisite for their application in multicellular organisms, but also highlight the benefit of chemical proteomics workflows such as activity&#8208;based protein profiling for characterizing proteome&#8208;wide potencies and selectivities of photocaged compounds.

         <title>Characterization of an Extradiol Dioxygenase Using Integrating Cavity Spectrophotometry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating cavity spectrophotometry enables the direct and efficient characterization of an extradiol dioxygenase using a whole cell&#8208;based assay. This approach obviates the need for protein purification and provides more information about enzyme behavior inside of the cellular environment. Kinetic assays were leveraged for the design of preparative&#8208;scale reactions for biocatalytic synthesis of ring&#8208;cleaved molecules in high yield. 

The development of synthetically&#8208;useful biocatalysts requires characterizing the behavior of an enzyme under conditions amenable to preparative&#8208;scale reactions. Whole cells harboring the catalyst of interest are often used in such reactions, as protein purification is laborious and expensive. However, monitoring reaction rates when using whole cells is challenging, as cellular debris precludes the use of a continuous assay. Herein, we describe an approach to continuous monitoring of whole cell reactions that is enabled by the use of an integrating cavity spectrophotometer. This approach was used to directly profile the kinetic behavior of a previously uncharacterized extradiol dioxygenase DfdB from Rhodococcus sp. YK2. Data obtained from these experiments were compared with traditional in vitro assays. In both whole cell and purified enzyme kinetic assays, similar enzymatic behaviors were observed, including substrate inhibition. Measured KM values and observed trends in catalytic efficiency were comparable for both types of enzyme preparation. Information provided by this analysis was leveraged to optimize preparative&#8208;scale whole cell reactions with DfdB, enabling the synthesis of two DfdB products in high yield. Importantly, this work showcases the potential for ICS&#8208;based methods to rapidly evaluate kinetic trends on analytical scale and thereby enables efficient reaction optimization for preparative&#8208;scale synthesis.

         <title>Enantiocomplementary Bioreduction of Flexible Ring N&#8208;(3&#8208;Oxobutyl)Heterocycles Providing Enantiopure Chiral Fragments for Drug Discovery</title>

Bioreduction of flexible ring N&#8208;(3&#8208;oxobutyl)&#8208;heterocycles mediated by enantiocomplementary recombinant alcohol dehydrogenases [an (S)&#8208;selective one from Rhodococcus aetherivorans (RaADH), and an (R)&#8208;selective one from Lactobacillus kefir (LkADH)], as whole&#8208;cell biocatalysts results in enantiopure (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;alcohols (ee &gt; 99%), which are promising chiral fragments with a high degree of drug&#8208;likeness for drug discovery.

In this study, the bioreduction of prochiral N&#8208;(3&#8208;oxobutyl)heterocycles comprising various (partially) saturated, flexible rings is explored using microbial whole&#8208;cell ketoreductases such as wild&#8208;type yeast strains including baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and Escherichia coli cells expressing two enantiocomplementary recombinant alcohol dehydrogenases. Initially, four wild&#8208;type yeast strains are screened for ketoreductase activity on a series of nine flexible N&#8208;heterocycles with prochiral carbonyl group in the N&#8208;(3&#8208;oxobutyl) sidechain. The yeast strains resulted in the corresponding (S)&#8208;alcohols with a low to moderate conversions. Using recombinant alcohol dehydrogenase whole&#8208;cell preparations as biocatalysts ((S)&#8208;selective ADH from Rhodococcus aetherivorans (RaADH) and (R)&#8208;selective ADH from Lactobacillus kefir (LkADH)) resulted in higher conversions in most cases, while maintaining the full enantiotopic selectivity. Usually, the preparative&#8208;scale bioreductions showed comparable or even higher conversions than those observed in the small&#8208;scale screening reactions, resulting in virtually enantiopure (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;alcohols (ee&#8201;&gt;&#8201;99%), which are promising chiral fragments with a high degree of drug&#8208;likeness. Docking studies confirmed the absolute configuration of the forming (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;alcohols.

         <title>AtGH3.10 and JAR1 Produce 12&#8208;Hydroxyjasmonoyl&#8208;l&#8208;isoleucine from 12&#8208;Hydroxyjasmonic Acid in Arabidopsis thaliana</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>

12&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;7&#8208;iso&#8208;jasmonic acid (12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA) is converted to an active jasmonate 12&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;7&#8208;iso&#8208;jasmonoyl&#8208;l&#8208;isoleucine (12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA&#8208;Ile) in Arabidopsis. Enzyme assays with recombinant enzymes and mutant analysis reveal that JAR1 and AtGH3.10 conjugate l&#8208;isoleucine to 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA. Higher catalytic efficiency is observed with 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA for AtGH3.10 than for JAR1.

Jasmonates are plant hormones that regulate plant defense and development. 7&#8208;iso&#8208;Jasmonoyl&#8208;l&#8208;isoleucine (JA&#8208;Ile) is a representative active jasmonate which is biosynthesized from 7&#8208;iso&#8208;jasmonic acid (JA) by the jasmonoyl&#8208;amido synthases JASMONATE RESISTANT 1 (JAR1) and AtGH3.10 in Arabidopsis thaliana. 12&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;7&#8208;iso&#8208;jasmonoyl&#8208;l&#8208;isoleucine (12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA&#8208;Ile) is another active jasmonate, and 12&#8208;hydroxylation of JA&#8208;Ile is considered the major biosynthetic pathway toward 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA&#8208;Ile. Previous report elucidated that recombinant JAR1 showed a weak activity against 12&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;7&#8208;iso&#8208;jasmonic acid (12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA). However, the direct conversion from 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA to 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA&#8208;Ile in planta and the enzyme activity of AtG3.10 against 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA have never been reported. Herein, a feeding experiment with deuterated 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA confirms the direct conversion of 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA to 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA&#8208;Ile in wild&#8208;type Arabidopsis plants. The conversion from 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA to 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA&#8208;Ile is not observed in jar1 gh3.10 double mutant, suggesting that 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA is converted to 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA&#8208;Ile by JAR1 and AtGH3.10. Notably, enzyme assays show that the catalytic efficiency with 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA for AtGH3.10 is higher than those with JA for AtGH3.10 and with 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA for JAR1. Comparative analysis of JAR1 and AtGH3.10 structures and site&#8208;directed mutation analysis reveals that Ser120 in AtGH3.10 is the key amino acid residue responsible for its high catalytic efficiency against 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA.

         <title>Characterization of the N&#8208;Hydroxylating Monooxygenase TheA from Thermocrispum agreste Reveals a Broad Substrate Spectrum</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
TheA is a moderate thermostable flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase which accepts, besides l&#8208;ornithine a number of related molecules for the regio&#8208;selective N&#8208;hydroxylation. The combination with a NADP+&#8208;reducing formate dehydrogenase variant (FDH M4) and a H2O2 degrading catalase allows in vitro biocatalytic applications.

The N&#8208;hydroxylating monooxygenase (NMO) TheA from Thermocrispum agreste catalyzes the N&#8208;hydroxylation step of l&#8208;ornithine, which is the first step in the thermochelin siderophore biosynthesis. Characterization of this enzyme revealed a significant thermostability up to 50&#8201;&#176;C and activity with the non&#8208;native substrate d&#8208;ornithine with kinetic parameters (Km&#8201;=&#8201;4.06&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.31&#8201;mM, kcat&#8201;=&#8201;0.057&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.001 s&#8722;1, and kcat/Km&#8201;=&#8201;0.007&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;mM&#8722;1) and a coupling rate of 81%. The enzyme is applied in a one&#8208;pot reaction with a formate dehydrogenase variant for NADPH regeneration and catalase for H2O2 detoxification. Optimization of the reaction conditions resulted in activity with various non&#8208;native substrates such as d&#8208;ornithine, l&#8208;lysine, S&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl)&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine, and l&#8208;arginine. Products are confirmed through LC&#8208;MS/MS, and mutagenesis experiments gave insight on the potentially underlying mechanisms. This work identifies a thermotolerant NMO that is suitable for application and as a starting point for enzyme engineering.

         <title>Cooperative Enhancement of Aldoxime Dehydratase Stability through Whole&#8208;Cell Immobilization and Flow Reactor Integration</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a synergistic approach to enhance the stability of the engineered aldoxime dehydratase OxdF1 (L318F/F306Y) by combining whole&#8208;cell immobilization in Ba&#8208;alginate with continuous flow processing. Applied to challenging substrates, like 2,6&#8208;difluorobenzaldoxime, the system enables efficient, stable nitrile synthesis with in&#8208;line product extraction and improved sustainability.

This study investigates the synthesis of aromatic nitriles using an evolved variant of OxdF1 (L318F/F306Y), an aldoxime dehydratase from Pseudomonas putida F1, engineered for improved catalytic efficiency toward benzaldehyde oxime. The double OxdF1 (L318F/F306Y) mutant effectively catalyzes the conversion of various benzaldoxime derivatives to the corresponding nitriles. Due to the enzyme's inherent instability, immobilized whole&#8208;cell systems are employed in a flow reactor to improve its stability and broaden its applicability, with the biotransformation of benzaldehyde oxime and 2,6&#8208;difluorobenzaldehyde oxime serving as case studies. The enzyme's stability is markedly improved, maintaining 87% yield even after 8&#8201;h of processing in the preparation of benzonitrile. Preparation of 2,6&#8208;difluorobenzontirile poses additional challenges due to the low water solubility of both the substrate, and even more so, the product, an important intermediate in various chemical applications. To overcome solubility limitations, a segmented liquid&#8211;liquid flow system (water/cyclohexane) was implemented, significantly improving the enzyme stability. The process was run continuously for 12&#8201;h, with a conversion of &#8776;70% by the end of the operation. Furthermore, 2,6&#8208;difluorobenzonitrile is selectively extracted in&#8208;line using a liquid&#8211;liquid extractor, thus, facilitating its efficient recovery and purification.

         <title>Artificial Peptides as Autophagy Modulators</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Autophagy is a fundamental cellular process that eliminates molecules and subcellular elements. This process is crucial for maintaining homeostasis and responding to various stressors, playing a key role in physiological development and the genesis of pathological conditions. This review summarizes recent advances in autophagy regulation strategies and the development of artificial peptide&#8208;based tools for monitoring and modulating autophagy.

Autophagy is a highly conserved lysosomal degradation pathway for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Its dysregulation is implicated in various diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and infections, making precise modulation of autophagy a potentially promising therapeutic strategy. Artificial peptide&#8208;based autophagy modulators have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional small molecules, offering several advantages in terms of specificity, biocompatibility, and functional versatility. This review summarizes recent advances in artificial peptide&#8208;based autophagy monitoring tools, autophagy inducers, and autophagy inhibitors.

         <title>Quantitative Strategies for Decoding Organelle Ion Dynamics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights cutting&#8208;edge strategies for probing ion dynamics within organelles using fluorescent indicators. It discusses key advances in calibration techniques for absolute ion quantification and their impact on understanding organellar physiology, and concludes with future directions and applications in decoding ion&#8208;regulated processes in health and disease.

Ion dynamics within cellular organelles are fundamental to numerous biochemical processes, maintaining homeostasis and enabling critical cellular functions. Despite continuous ion movement across organelle membranes, stable ionic gradients are preserved, creating optimal microenvironments for organelle&#8208;specific activities such as ATP production in mitochondria, lysosomal degradation, Golgi&#8208;mediated protein modifications, and DNA processing in the nucleus. These gradients are regulated by specialized membrane proteins, including ion channels and transporters, which facilitate selective and controlled ion flux. Dysfunction in these regulatory proteins is linked to various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular conditions, immune dysfunctions, and cancers. Understanding ion regulation mechanisms at the molecular level is not only essential for basic cell biology but also crucial for revealing pathological pathways and identifying therapeutic targets. Recent technological advances&#8212;such as fluorescent probes based on green fluorescent protein, small molecules, and DNA nanodevices&#8212;have significantly enhanced our ability to study ion dynamics with high spatial and temporal resolution. These tools enable both qualitative and quantitative analyses, offering insights into ion transport mechanisms and their physiological relevance. A comprehensive overview of the principles underlying functional imaging of ion dynamics is provided, current challenges in quantitative assessment are highlighted, and future directions in organelle&#8208;specific ion regulation are discussed.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Photochemical Biology of Serotonin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The neurotransmitter serotonin influences a wide range of behaviors and biological processes through a series of serotonin receptors and transporters. Recent photochemical tools have made it possible to follow this complicated web of interactions with ever improving spatial and temporal resolution.

Serotonin (5&#8208;HT) is an endogenous neurotransmitter that plays a key role in cellular signaling. Its interactions with serotonin receptors (5&#8208;HTRs) and the serotonin transporter (SERT) influence processes as disparate as hunger, happiness, healing, and headaches. Over the last several decades, photochemical tools have been developed to observe, track, and modulate these serotonin&#8211;protein interactions. The tools tend to fit into one of four categories: photoswitches, photocages, photobiosensors, or photocross&#8208;linkers. This review examines the development and application of these photochemical tools for 5&#8208;HT, 5&#8208;HTRs, and SERT over the last &#8776;10&#8201;years, with an emphasis on the chemistry involved.

         <title>Two&#8208;Color Timestamping of Gene Expression with a Chemigenetic Reporter System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemigenetic reporter assay is developed that enables monitoring of BiP/GRP78 expression, an important chaperone and key regulator of the unfolded protein response. The system is based on the coexpression of BiP/GRP78 and the self&#8208;labeling protein HaloTag. Using a two&#8208;color labeling strategy for improved readout sensitivity, the assay is applied in high&#8208;content screening for novel activators of BiP/GRP78 expression.

Stress response pathways rely on coordinated gene expression regulation. In the endoplasmic reticulum, the unfolded protein response plays an important role in maintaining the homeostasis of protein folding and processing. A chemigenetic reporter assay is developed that allows monitoring of BiP/GRP78 expression, a key regulator of the unfolded protein response. The system is based on the coexpression of the self&#8208;labeling protein HaloTag via an internal ribosome entry site. HaloTag allows for flexibility in labeling color as well as labeling timepoint. A two&#8208;color timestamping strategy is designed that provides improved readout sensitivity. The reporter system can be used in live&#8208;cell imaging as well as flow cytometry. It is applied in a high&#8208;content screening experiment in which a new promising activator of BiP/GRP78 expression was identified.

         <title>Advances and Challenges in Bioprocess Optimization for the Synthesis of Sugar Nucleotides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of flow biocatalysis for the production of glycan building blocks, sugar nucleotides, is considered.

Sugar nucleotides represent the cornerstone building blocks for glycan biosynthesis. While methods to access these crucial biomolecules using traditional batch synthetic chemistry and enzymatic approaches have blossomed, uptake using flow&#8208;based synthesis is burgeoning. This perspective analyzes recent advances concerning enzyme immobilization and continuous flow biocatalysis for sugar nucleotide production and usage. Evaluation of related technologies is also discussed, highlighting new enzyme immobilization approaches, novel reactor design, and improved downstream processing as areas that must evolve to enable wider, scalable access to sugar nucleotides as commodity chemicals.

Bioactivity Profiles of Progressively Ring&#8208;Fluorinated Cyclohexyl Motifs in the WKYMVm Peptide as Formylpeptide FPR2 Agonists and in Keto&#8208;Piperazines as Antitrypanosome Agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;cis&#8208;fluorinated cyclohexyl motifs with progressively increasing levels of fluorine are introduced into the WKYMVm peptide and a class of keto&#8208;piperazine derivatives and assayed against the FPR2 receptor or the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, respectively. Increasing fluorination, reduced Log P's, however it generally results in poorer bioactivities, indicating an inverse relationship between cyclohexane ring polarity and bioactivity in each case.

A series of all&#8208;cis&#8208;ring&#8208;fluorinated cyclohexylalanines with progressively increasing levels of vicinal fluorines, as well as 4&#8208;fluorophenylalanine and pentafluoroarylphenylalanine is introduced into the WKYMVm peptide in place of its tyrosine residue, for assays against the G&#8208;protein coupled formylpeptide receptor, FPR2. Selected all&#8208;cis&#8208;ring cyclohexylalanines of this class are also incorporated into a keto&#8208;piperazine molecular scaffold to generate sp3&#8208;rich derivatives for assays against the parasite Trypanosoma brucei. For these cyclohexylalanine analogs bioactivity trends correlate progressively with the levels of fluorination in each of the case studies. Notably, the all&#8208;cis pentafluorocyclohexylalanine analog of the W&#8208;peptide is least active perhaps correlating with the well&#8208;known polarity of this &#8216;Janus face&#8217; cyclohexane. Although the trend is also apparent in the anti&#8208;trypanosomal assays of the keto&#8208;piperazine derivatives, it is less so and some compounds are more active than the previously reported phenylalanine&#8208;derived analog.

&lt;p&gt;All-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-fluorinated cyclohexyl motifs with progressively increasing levels of fluorine are introduced into the WKYMVm peptide and a class of keto-piperazine derivatives and assayed against the FPR2 receptor or the parasite &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma brucei,&lt;/i&gt; respectively. Increasing fluorination, reduced Log P's, however it generally results in poorer bioactivities, indicating an inverse relationship between cyclohexane ring polarity and bioactivity in each case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of all-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-ring-fluorinated cyclohexylalanines with progressively increasing levels of vicinal fluorines, as well as 4-fluorophenylalanine and pentafluoroarylphenylalanine is introduced into the WKYMVm peptide in place of its tyrosine residue, for assays against the G-protein coupled formylpeptide receptor, FPR2. Selected all-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-ring cyclohexylalanines of this class are also incorporated into a keto-piperazine molecular scaffold to generate sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-rich derivatives for assays against the parasite &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma brucei.&lt;/i&gt; For these cyclohexylalanine analogs bioactivity trends correlate progressively with the levels of fluorination in each of the case studies. Notably, the all-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; pentafluorocyclohexylalanine analog of the W-peptide is least active perhaps correlating with the well-known polarity of this &#8216;Janus face&#8217; cyclohexane. Although the trend is also apparent in the anti-trypanosomal assays of the keto-piperazine derivatives, it is less so and some compounds are more active than the previously reported phenylalanine-derived analog.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From Molecule to Meaning: Click and Bioorthogonal Chemical Reporters for Plant Systems, Biological Imaging, and Artistic Expression</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
At the intersection of chemical biology, plant imaging, and contemporary art, this review introduces the concept of chembioart. By tracing how chemical reporters illuminate plant biomolecules in vivo, their role not only in advancing scientific understanding but also in inspiring transdisciplinary collaborations and visual expression&#160;is highlighted.

Chemical biology has reshaped the ability to investigate complex biological systems at the molecular level. In this context, chemical reporters have become important tools for labeling and tracking biomolecules in living systems with spatial and temporal precision. In plant biology, they provide an alternative to genetic approaches and allow the study of dynamic processes in species or organs that are not easily accessible. Through the use of click and bioorthogonal chemistry, small&#8208;molecule probes can be metabolically incorporated into specific molecular scaffolds such as sugars, monolignols, amino acids, and lipids. These probes make it possible to follow events like glycosylation, lignification, lipid turnover, or protein synthesis in living plant tissues. This review presents an overview of current chemical reporter strategies, from molecular design and synthetic considerations to their application in plant imaging. Herein, how these tools have contributed to the development of plant chemical biology by enabling precise and modular investigations of plant structure and metabolism is described. Herein, it is also examined how chemical reporters have entered interdisciplinary contexts, including collaborations between science and the arts. By converting molecular&#8208;level information into visual and sensory formats, these approaches open new perspectives for research, education, and communication across scientific and creative disciplines.

         <title>Recent Advances on Dehydroalanine&#8208;Specific Modification and Diversification of Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical modifications based on dehydroalanine (Dha) have attracted considerable attention in the field of peptide and protein functionalization due to their high efficiency and site selectivity. This review summarizes the latest progress on the Dha&#8208;specific modification and diversification of peptides and proteins, as well as their applications in chemical biology and drug discovery.

In recent years, chemical modification techniques based on dehydroalanine (Dha) have become a prominent area in the functionalization of peptides and proteins due to their high efficiency and site selectivity. This article reviews the recent advancements in the modification of Dha&#8208;containing peptides and proteins. Focusing on the chemical properties of Dha, the advantages of nucleophilic addition reactions, free radical chemistry, metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and cycloaddition reactions in peptide and protein modification are discussed, as well as their applicability in the development of novel biocompatible methods. Additionally, the article explores the current limitations of these techniques and highlights future challenges that need to be addressed.

         <title>Binding of Hg(I) and Hg(II) Ions to Amyloid&#8208;Beta (A&#946;) Peptide Variants Affect Their Structure and Aggregation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mercury (Hg) exposure is a possible risk factor for Alzheimer&#180;s disease (AD). Some studies reported higher Hg levels in AD patients, but evidence is inconclusive. A mechanism linking Hg exposure to AD neuropathology remains to be found. The hallmark of AD brains is deposits of insoluble amyloid plaques consisting mainly of aggregated amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides.
&#160;
Here, we use transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and biophysical spectroscopy techniques to study in vitro interactions between inorganic Hg and pathologically relevant A&#946;(1&#8208;40) and A&#946;(4&#8208;40) variants and the A&#946;(1&#8208;40)(H6A, H13A, H14A) mutant. For the first time, effect on A&#946; aggregation of both Hg(I) and Hg(II) is compared.
&#160;
Hg(II) binds A&#946;(1&#8208;40) with apparent binding affinity of 28&#177;8 &#181;M, at 20 &#176;C in 20 mM MES buffer, pH 7.3. The N&#8208;terminal His6, His13 and His14 residues are involved in binding coordination. Hg(II) binding induces structural alterations (coil&#8208;coil interactions) in A&#946; monomers positioned in membrane&#8208;mimicking SDS micelles. Equimolar amounts of either Hg(I) or Hg(II) inhibit normal A&#946; fibrillation by directing aggregation towards formation of large amorphous aggregates. All these structural rearrangements may be relevant for the harmful A&#946; aggregation processes involved in AD brain pathology. Inducing protein misfolding and aggregation might be a general toxic mechanism of mercury.</dc:description>
