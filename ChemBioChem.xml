         <title>A&#160;de novo&#160;designed metalloprotein displays variable thermal stability and binding stoichiometry with transition metal ions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;binding selectivity in natural proteins is determined by multiple factors such as the protein&#8217;s structure, metal concentration within cellular compartments and the presence of metallochaperones. The in vitro selectivity of proteins for transition metal ions is largely governed by the Irving&#8208;Williams series, that states protein&#8208;metal complex stability follows the order Co(II) &lt; Ni(II) &lt; Cu(II) &gt; Zn(II). We have designed a de novo protein that folds in the presence of certain transition metal ions into a monomeric &#945;&#8208;helical bundle, with the least stable protein&#8208;metal complex being formed with Cu(II). Moreover, when increasing the metal concentration of Cu(II) or Zn(II), more metal ions are incorporated into the protein accompanied by a concurrent decrease in the amount of secondary structure. We propose one reason may be that there is a balance between stability conferred by coordination of the metal ion(s) and stability conferred by hydrophobic packing of the &#945;&#8208;helical bundle. Metals may therefore adopt distorted coordination geometries, or binding of multiple ions may cause distortion of the protein backbone, leading to compromised folding of the protein scaffold, or variable thermal stabilities of the metalloprotein complexes. This protein scaffold therefore contributes to the deciphering of design rules for metal selectivity in proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>A Thermostable Bacterial Metallohydrolase that Degrades Organophosphate Plasticizers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This bacterial enzyme, cyclase&#8208;phosphotriesterase (C&#8208;PTE) from Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS&#8208;3, shows significant potential for breaking down organophosphate pollutants. Beyond its capability to hydrolyze specific plasticizers such as triphenyl phosphate and tris(2&#8208;chloropropyl) phosphate, C&#8208;PTE's crystal structure reveals a binuclear zinc active site, and it possesses exceptional thermostability, remaining stable up to 90&#8201;&#176;C. These characteristics highlight its promise for future bioremediation applications.

A cyclase&#8208;phosphotriesterase (C&#8208;PTE) from Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS&#8208;3 has recently been identified for its capacity to detoxify several organophosphate compounds. However, several aspects of this enzyme remain unexplored, such as its activity with industrial organophosphates, its molecular structure, and its thermostability. In this work, the crystal structure of C&#8208;PTE is reported, which is solved to 2.3&#8201;&#197; resolution, providing insight into the enzyme's mechanism of action, revealing a binuclear Zn2+ active site and distant similarity to other phosphotriesterases from the amidohydrolase superfamily. It is shown that C&#8208;PTE catalyzes the hydrolysis of the OP plasticizers triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) and tris(2&#8208;chloropropyl) phosphate (TCPP), albeit with low efficiency, but not the sterically bulkier tri&#8208;o&#8208;tolyl phosphate (ToTP). Finally, it is demonstrated that, even though Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS&#8208;3 is not a thermophile, C&#8208;PTE exhibits remarkable thermostability and retains structure up to 90&#8201;&#176;C. Overall, these findings advance the understanding of C&#8208;PTE, suggesting that it is a good candidate for engineering owing to its thermostability and that it could contribute to bioremediation strategies to reduce the impact of pollution by industrial organophosphates.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Reactions for Bioactive Sulfur Species Delivery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 10, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review introduces the concept of bioorthogonal reactions triggered bioactive sulfur species delivery and summarizes representative delivery systems developed by this strategy in recent years. This approach offers a promising solution to realize precise and controllable small sulfuric molecule release. These bioorthogonal prodrug strategies also have enhanced benefits, including organelle targeting ability, spatiotemporal fluorescence feedback, and orthogonality with other reactions.

Bioorthogonal chemistry has emerged as a powerful tool for the development of controllable drug delivery systems. Bioactive sulfur species, which participate in complex sulfur signaling pathways, play crucial roles in various physiological and pathological processes. However, achieving precise and controlled administration of these sulfur species remains challenging due to their unique physicochemical properties. Over the past few years, a growing number of delivery strategies, which are triggered by different stimuli, have been developed to enhance our understanding of sulfur signaling. Bioorthogonal triggers not only offer excellent controllability but also provide advantages such as tunability, targeted delivery, and spatiotemporal feedback. This review highlights representative donors that can be activated through bioorthogonal reactions and their applications in studying the biological mechanisms and therapeutic functions of the bioactive sulfur species.

         <title>The Persistent Myth of Limonene's Smell</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 10, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural monoterpenes stir our sense of smell in a special way. The scent of the monoterpene limonene, a major component of citrus oils, is thoroughly investigated. Still, the information on its smell is confusing. In this Perspective article, the smell of citrus oils and its odorant components are discussed, focusing especially on the two enantiomers of limonene.

The scent of the well&#8208;known monoterpene limonene is thoroughly investigated. Despite this, the scientific community does not reach consensus. In this Perspective article, a discussion is contributed by giving a simple overview of the olfactory system, as well as presenting the smell of well&#8208;known compounds and their odor threshold values in citrus oils, from which (R)&#8208;limonene is extracted. In particular, the composition of oils from orange and lemon peel and their association with the (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;enantiomers of limonene, respectively, are considered. Then, the controversy surrounding the odors of (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;limonene and the myth that has been spun from this are reported, particularly in the organic chemistry literature, before an argument for why this myth should be dismantled. Based on the chemical and physiological processes involved in the sense of smell, whether the odor attributed to a certain compound is from that compound and/or from derivatives produced by enzymes associated with the olfactory system is also briefly discussed.

         <title>Induction and Manipulation of Biomolecular Condensates Through Spatially Heterogeneous Solution Conditions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 10, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this concept article, it is discussed how spatial control over the formation and movement of biomolecular condensates (BMCs) can be achieved and how this type of control can help in the reliable generation and study of BMCs. Spatial control over BMCs is crucial in&#8201;vivo and therefore also desirable for in&#8201;vitro studies in order to approach relevant scenarios.

The study of biomolecular condensates (BMCs) is of great current interest because of the proposed roles of these types of assemblies in biological function and disease. In living cells, BMCs form in a highly heterogeneous environment and are influenced by concentration gradients of various relevant species. Furthermore, the biological functionality of the BMCs requires precise spatial control of their formation in some cases. In recent years, a number of in&#8201;vitro experimental approaches have emerged that allow the generation, study, and manipulation of BMCs through the creation of well&#8208;defined spatially heterogeneous solution conditions relevant for BMC formation. In this concept article, it is presented in what way such methods can contribute to improved understanding and control of BMCs.

Held at the Institut Curie in Paris on February 27&#8211;28, 2025, it showcased the latest innovations in designing molecular tools to probe and manipulate biological systems. Through insightful presentations and discussions, the symposium highlighted emerging trends and directions in this rapidly evolving discipline.

This symposium is the 6th Paris Sciences &amp; Lettres (PSL) Chemical Biology meeting (2015, 2016, 2019, 2023, 2024, 2025) being held at Institut Curie. This initiative originally started in 2013 at Institut de Chimie des Substances Naturelles (ICSN) in Gif&#8208;sur&#8208;Yvette and was mostly focused on organic synthesis. It was then exported at Institut Curie to cover a larger scope, before becoming the official French Chemical Biology meeting. This year, around 200 participants had the opportunity to meet world leaders in chemistry and biology who described their latest innovations and future trends covering topics as diverse as prebiotic chemistry, activity&#8208;based protein profiling, high&#8208;resolution cell imaging, nanotechnologies, bio&#8208;orthogonal chemistry, metal ion signaling, ferroptosis, and biocatalysis.

         <title>Development of a Peptide Inhibitor Targeting the C&#8208;SH2 Domain of the SHP2 Phosphatase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 10, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peptide inhibitor targeting the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain&#8208;containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2) has been developed that binds to and blocks the C&#8208;SH2 domain. The C&#8208;SH2 inhibitor peptide is stable, selective, cell permeable, and noncytotoxic making it an enabling chemical tool to study SHP2 in cells.

Src homology 2 (SH2) domain&#8208;containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2) mediates important signal transduction upon cell surface receptor stimulation, regulating multiple cellular functions. In addition to the catalytically active phosphotyrosine (pTyr) phosphatase domain, SHP2 contains two regulatory pTyr&#8208;binding domains: the N&#8208;SH2 and C&#8208;SH2 domains. While the role of the N&#8208;SH2 domain is well understood, the role of the C&#8208;SH2 domain is less clear. To support studies on the involvement of the domains in SHP2 function, herein, the development of a peptide inhibitor containing a nonhydrolysable pTyr mimetic, which selectively binds to the C&#8208;SH2 domain of SHP2 and blocks its protein&#8211;protein interactions, is described. Incorporation of the pTyr mimetic l&#8208;O&#8208;malonyltyrosine (l&#8208;OMT) results in robust binding affinity to the C&#8208;SH2 domain, while the widely used pTyr mimetic phosphonodifluoromethyl phenylalanine (F2Pmp) abolishes binding, showing that this mimetic is not a general binder of SH2 domains, which challenges existing notions. The C&#8208;SH2 inhibitor peptide (CSIP) is stable, selective, cell permeable, and noncytotoxic. CSIP enriches the toolbox of inhibitors with different modes of action targeting SHP2, and will support studies to better understand SHP2 regulation and interactions, which can ultimately inform new drug discovery efforts.

         <title>Target&#8208;Guided Design and Synthesis of Aryl&#8208;Functionalized Promysalin Analogs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 10, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, target&#8208;guided analog design was employed to enhance the interactions of promysalin, a species&#8208;specific Pseudomonad inhibitor, with succinate dehydrogenase. We hypothesized that aromatic analogs could target an unexplored region primed for &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions leading to more potent compounds. Here, we report the in&#8208;silico design, scalable route, and biological characterization against a panel of clinically relevant strains.

The development of new narrow&#8208;spectrum antibiotics is a promising approach to combat antibiotic resistance. Promysalin, a secondary metabolite isolated from Pseudomonas putida, exhibits potent species&#8208;specific inhibition of the pathogen P. aeruginosa (IC50 21&#8201;nM). Herein, the total synthesis and stereochemical assignment of promysalin, structure&#8211;activity relationship studies, and the identification of its molecular target, succinate dehydrogenase, are previously reported by the group. These findings enable computational studies of promysalin's interactions with succinate dehydrogenase, revealing a novel binding site region primed for &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions with a nearby tryptophan residue. It is hypothesized that new aromatic analogs of promysalin can target this beneficial interaction, potentially leading to more potent inhibitors of P. aeruginosa growth. Herein, the in silico design of these analogs, a scalable and general synthetic route to access them, and characterization of their activity against a panel of clinically relevant P. aeruginosa strains are reported.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of new narrow-spectrum antibiotics is a promising approach to combat antibiotic resistance. Promysalin, a secondary metabolite isolated from &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas putida&lt;/i&gt;, exhibits potent species-specific inhibition of the pathogen &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 21&#8201;nM). Herein, the total synthesis and stereochemical assignment of promysalin, structure&#8211;activity relationship studies, and the identification of its molecular target, succinate dehydrogenase, are previously reported by the group. These findings enable computational studies of promysalin's interactions with succinate dehydrogenase, revealing a novel binding site region primed for &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions with a nearby tryptophan residue. It is hypothesized that new aromatic analogs of promysalin can target this beneficial interaction, potentially leading to more potent inhibitors of &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; growth. Herein, the in silico design of these analogs, a scalable and general synthetic route to access them, and characterization of their activity against a panel of clinically relevant &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; strains are reported.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Wireframe DNA Origami Capable of Vertex&#8208;protruding Transformation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 10, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wireframe DNA origami capable of vertex&#8208;protruding transformation is reported. Spacer strands between vertices and edges introduce vertex&#8208;specific flexibility, enabling designed vertex protrusion. Through DNA hybridization and strand displacement reactions, the structure is reversibly transformed between open&#8208; and closed&#8208;forms. This vertex&#8208;protruding transformation mechanism will expand the design possibilities of dynamic DNA nanostructures with tunable functions and applications.







Abstract
Regulating dynamic behavior of the designed molecular structures provides a foundation for the construction of functional molecular devices. DNA nanotechnology allows conformational changes in two&#8208;dimensional and three&#8208;dimensional DNA origami nanostructures by introducing flexibility between the faces of the structures. However, dynamic transformations in wireframe DNA origami, composed solely of vertices and edges, remain challenging due to vertex&#8208;specific flexibility. We report a wireframe DNA origami capable of vertex&#8208;protruding transformation between the open&#8208; and closed&#8208;form with eight protruding vertices. This reversible transformation is driven by DNA hybridization and a toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement reaction. Spacer strands between vertices and edges were designed to introduce flexibility. Coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that a longer spacer increases conformational flexibility and can achieve the narrow angles required for the vertex&#8208;protruding transformation. The experimental results showed the successful assembly of the open&#8208;form structure under optimized salt conditions, as visualized through transmission electron microscopy images. Furthermore, the transformation between the open&#8208; and closed&#8208;form structures was demonstrated by the sequential addition of signal strands. This vertex&#8208;protruding transformation mechanism will expand the design approach of dynamic DNA nanostructures and help develop functional molecular devices for artificial molecular systems.

         <title>Impact of Mutational Status on Intracellular Effects of Cell&#8208;Permeable CaaX Peptides in Pancreatic Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 10, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work deals with intracellular effects of cell&#8208;permeable CaaX&#8208;peptides, designed to influence prenylated proteins like KRas. The results show that after CaaX&#8208;1 treatment, not only KRas expression and signaling are specifically altered in mutated pancreatic cancer cells, but also plasma membrane localization of KRas is affected. Thus, CaaX&#8208;peptides are promising tools to manipulate prenylation&#8208;dependent proteins.

Prenyltransferases add a lipid group to the cysteine of a CaaX motif of proteins. This posttranslational modification enables proteins to attach to membranes where they are essential hubs for signaling, trafficking, and apoptosis. Recently, cell&#8208;permeable CaaX&#8208;peptides are developed as possible tools to interfere with the prenylation machinery. These peptides cause cytotoxic effects, particularly in KRas mutant pancreatic cancer cells (PANC&#8208;1) in which they also alter downstream signaling of Ras proteins. Herein, the aim is to get more clues about the relevance of the mutational status of KRas. Therefore, the activity of CaaX&#8208;peptides in KRas wildtype BxPC&#8208;3 and KRas mutated PANC&#8208;1 cells is compared. CaaX&#8208;peptides differently influence these two cell lines, although they internalize pretty much to the same extent. Indeed, an altered KRas plasma membrane localization in PANC&#8208;1 cells is observed, probably induced by disturbed KRas prenylation based on the presence of CaaX&#8208;peptides. The impact of CaaX&#8208;peptides on KRas signaling is likely dependent on the KRas mutation in PANC&#8208;1 cells in which they further trigger effects on KRas&#8208;dependent regulators, e.g., Neurofibromin &#8722;1 (NF1) and son of sevenless homolog 1 (SOS1). All in all, CaaX peptides are identified as promising tools for studying and manipulating the function of therapeutically important prenylated proteins.

         <title>The Position of Indole Methylation Controls the Structure, DNA Binding, and Cellular Functions of Mithramycin SA&#8208;Trp Analogues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 10, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study showcases the power of a single methyl group in a large DNA binding molecule, a semisynthetic analogue of mithramycin, to alter the structural and functional properties of this molecule. These properties include selective cytotoxicity against cells of Ewing sarcoma, a pediatric cancer.

Mithramycin (MTM) is a polyketide anticancer natural product, which functions by noncovalent binding to DNA in the minor groove without intercalation, resulting in inhibiting transcription at G/C&#8208;rich promoters. MTM is a potent inhibitor of cancer cells, such as Ewing sarcoma, driven by abnormal fusions involving E26 transformation&#8208;specific (ETS) family transcription factors friend leukemia integration 1 (FLI1) and ETS&#8208;related gene (ERG). However, MTM is rather toxic and nonselective; therefore, safer, selective analogues of MTM are required for use in the clinic as anticancer drugs. Herein, by using a combination of X&#8208;ray crystallographic, biophysical, and cell and molecular biological techniques, the structural and functional consequences of 3&#8208;side chain methylation at positions 5, 6, and 7 of the indole ring of the potent analogue MTM SA&#8208;Trp are explored. The conformation of the analogues in complexes with DNA, their DNA binding function, cytotoxicity, selectivity, and potency as transcription antagonists depended on the position of the methylation. MTM SA&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;Trp emerged as the most selective analogue, presumably due to the right balance of the DNA binding and the solvent exposure of the 3&#8208;side chain. This study demonstrates that minor chemical changes can have strong effects in analogue development and paves the way to further development of next&#8208;generation MTM analogues.

         <title>Lienhwalides: Unique Tropolone&#8211;Maleidride Hybrids from Hypoxylon lienhwacheense</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 10, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lienhwalides are novel tropolone&#8211;maleidride hybrid molecules unique in nature. Absolute configuration is solved by semisynthetic approaches and X&#8208;ray analysis. Interplay between both lwt and lwm biosynthetic gene clusters is responsible for the production of lienhwalides.

Hypoxylon lienhwacheense, a fungal species with an unclear taxonomic placement within the Hypoxylaceae, presents a highly rare stromatal secondary metabolite profile. Isolation of its major stromatal constituents leads to the discovery of a novel tropolone&#8211;maleidride hybrid molecule, lienhwalide A 5, in addition to the known cordyanhydride B 6, its new derivative 7, and binaphthalenetetraol 8. Unexpectedly, Hypoxylon lienhwacheense produces in liquid cultures various lienhwalide A congeners 9&#8211;11. Their structures and relative configurations are elucidated using high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry&#160;and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, with their absolute configurations determined using X&#8208;ray analysis of a semisynthetic brominated derivative of 9 and synthesizing &#945;&#8208;methoxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylphenylacetyl&#160;esters of 11. Feeding experiments with 13C&#8208;labeled precursors (13C&#8208;methionine; 1&#8208;13C&#8208; and U&#8208;13C6&#8208;glucose) reveal insights into the biogenesis of tropolone and maleidride moieties, according to 13C couplings and incredible natural abundance double quantum transfer NMR data. Genome analysis identifies two separate biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for these moieties, and heterologous expression experiments provide further insights into the interplay of both clusters during the biosynthesis of these hybrid natural products. Remarkably, lienhwalides exhibit reduced toxicity and enhance antibacterial selectivity compared to related fungal tropolones.

         <title>Synthesis and Structure of Naphthoyl Thiourea&#8208;Based Binuclear Ruthenium(II) Arene Complexes: Studies on Anticancer Activity and Apoptotic Mechanism</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 10, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A distinct set of naphthoyl thiourea&#8208;based binuclear ruthenium(II) p&#8208;cymene complexes is constructed and characterized. All the complexes display excellent cytotoxicity against various human cancer cells. Furthermore, apoptosis induction is assessed by acridine orange&#8208;ethidium bromide, Hoechst 33&#8201;342, mitochondrial membrane potential, and reactive oxygen species detection, and quantified by flow cytometry.

Herein, the synthesis, characterization, and anticancer activity of ruthenium(II) p&#8208;cymene complexes comprising naphthoyl thiourea&#8208;based ligands are described. The synthesized N^O and N^S chelating ruthenium(II) complexes (1&#8211;3) are fully characterized by elemental analysis and spectral (fourier transform&#8208;infrared, Ultraviolet&#8208;visible, nuclear magnetic resonance, mass) methods. The structure of complex 2 has been elucidated by employing single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, which verifies the two bidentate N^O and N^S coordination of the thiourea ligand to two Ru(II) centers. All the complexes have been screened for their anticancer efficacy in breast (MCF&#8208;7), colon (HT&#8208;29), liver (HepG2) cancerous cells, and noncancerous kidney (Hek&#8208;293) cells. Among them, complex 2 with an IC50 concentration of 3.59&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.72&#8201;&#956;m exhibits the most potent activity in HT&#8208;29 cells, surpassing the positive control, cisplatin. This may be due to the hydrophobic nature of the p&#8208;cymene moiety and electron&#8208;releasing methoxy group in the ligand scaffold. In addition, acridine orange&#8208;ethidium bromide and Hoechst labeling of all the complexes (1&#8211;3) on HT&#8208;29 cells reveal morphological alterations such as nuclear fragmentation and chromatin condensation resulting from the death of cancerous cells via apoptosis. Biochemical assays such as reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential, and flow cytometry strongly confirm the cell death via mitochondrial dysfunction&#8208;mediated apoptosis.

         <title>Tuning Tetrazine Substituents to Enhance Vinyltetrazine Labeling Performance</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 10, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
3&#8208;position&#8208;modified vinyltetrazines are thiol&#8208;specific reagents for precision biomedicine. Six derivatives show tunable thiol&#8208;labeling (k2&#8201;=&#8201;17.7&#8211;227&#8201;M&#8722;1s&#8722;1) and rapid bioorthogonal kinetics (k2&#8201;=&#8201;1.4&#8211;5.7&#8201;&#215;&#8201;103&#8201;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). High peptide labeling yields (88%&#8211;99%), serum/reduced glutathione&#160;stability, improved cellular uptake via charge/lipophilicity optimization, pretargeted cell imaging, and radionuclide labeling are achieved.

The site&#8208;specific labeling of peptides and proteins is a powerful tool for investigating biological processes. It is demonstrated that the powerful thiol&#8208;specific labeling reagent vinyltetrazine activates prodrugs and enables 18F and near&#8208;infrared dual&#8208;modality imaging. It is predicted that substitutions at the 3&#8208;position of tetrazine can affect the labeling efficiency, bioorthogonal kinetics, and stability. Six vinyltetrazines with different 3&#8208;position modifications exhibit rapid labeling and, subsequently, bioorthogonal kinetics and excellent stability. Vinyltetrazine labeling modifies the charge characteristics and lipophilicity of target peptides, thereby improving cellular uptake. This research on tuning tetrazine substituents will aid in the construction of a comprehensive vinyltetrazine library, leading to the development of new peptide conjugates and pretargeted immuno&#8208;positron emission tomography (immune&#8208;PET) imaging.

         <title>Structure&#8211;Affinity Relationship Analysis and Affinity Maturation of a Calprotectin&#8208;Binding Peptide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 10, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peptide that binds to the inflammatory marker calprotectin with sub&#8208;micromolar affinity has potential as an affinity reagent in diagnostic assays. To improve its binding, a structure&#8211;activity relationship study and various library synthesis and screening approaches were undertaken. Several favorable canonical and non&#8208;canonical amino acids are identified and combined to improve the binding affinity fivefold (KD = 39&#8201;&#177;&#8201;5&#8201;nM).

Peptide 3 is an 18&#8208;amino acid linear peptide binding with sub&#8208;micromolar affinity to the inflammation marker calprotectin. Its application in point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostic assays has shown promising results, yet improving its affinity for calprotectin could facilitate the development of sensitive and robust assays. Herein, a detailed structure&#8211;activity relationship analysis of Peptide 3 is reported to better understand the importance of each individual amino acid for the binding to calprotectin. Moreover, two different approaches have been followed here, one based on prolonging the peptide with random sequences and phage display selection, and one on screening chemically synthesized peptide variants containing non&#8208;canonical amino acids, to increase its binding affinity. Combining several mutations that enhance affinity by small factors yielded Peptide 4 binding human calprotectin with a KD of 39&#8201;&#177;&#8201;5&#8201;nM measured by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, which is a five&#8208;fold improvement compared to the previously reported Peptide 3.

         <title>Discovery and In&#8201;Vitro Reconstitution of Closoxazole Biosynthesis from Pyxidicoccus fallax</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 10, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The myxobacterium Pyxidicoccus fallax is found to be a producer of benzoxazole&#8208;containing natural products named closoxazoles. In vitro studies with the biosynthetic enzymes reveal new insights into the reaction mechanism for closoxazole formation. The biosynthetic plasticity enables the production of new closoxazoles with different substitution patterns, increasing the structural diversity of benzoxazole&#8208;containing natural products.

Benzoxazoles are important structural components of both bioactive natural products and pharmaceutical active ingredients. In this study, a putative benzoxazole gene cluster originating from the myxobacterium Pyxidicoccus fallax is investigated. This gene cluster is found to confer the ability for production of closoxazoles, which were recently discovered in the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium cavendishii. To obtain further insights into the biosynthetic mechanism, the required key enzymes are subjected to in&#8201;vitro studies. Notably, significant differences to the biosynthetic pathway in C. cavendishii are observed. First, the condensing amidohydrolase uses an unstable ester as substrate and, thus, establishes a C&#63743;N bond for benzoxazole formation. In contrast, the homolog from C. cavendishii is thought to use an amide substrate. Second, both AMP ligases encoded in this pathway attach a third aryl carboxylic acid building block to the benzoxazole intermediate, but these enzymes exhibit different regioselectivities. This facilitates the production of closoxazole A and B but also gives access to new derivatives in which a third building block is linked to the phenolic amine of the benzoxazole. The substrate flexibility of these enzymes allows us to introduce other building blocks into the biosynthetic pathway and thus expand the structural diversity of benzoxazole&#8208;containing natural products.

         <title>Profiling Serine Hydrolases in the Leishmania Host&#8211;Pathogen Interactome Using Cell&#8208;Permeable Activity&#8208;Based Fluorophosphonate Probes</title>

Leishmaniasis poses a global health challenge with limited treatment options and rising drug resistance. Activity&#8208;based protein profiling using fluorophosphonate probes is employed to profile serine hydrolases, key virulence factors in Leishmania mexicana. Changes in SHs expression levels across the life stages highlight their critical role in the parasite&#8211;host interactome, providing valuable insights into infectivity mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.

Leishmaniasis, a vector&#8208;borne neglected tropical disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania, is a major global public health challenge with millions of new cases annually. Treatment of leishmaniasis is difficult for many reasons including multiple lifecycle stages, involving both an infective insect vector form, the promastigote, and a disease&#8208;causing intracellular mammalian host form, the amastigote, and increasing drug tolerance that are all linked by the interplay between parasite and host. Activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) was employed using new cell&#8208;permeable fluorophosphonate probes to explore serine hydrolases (SHs) in Leishmania mexicana with subsequent analysis enabled by secondary reaction with an affinity reagent. Importantly, these cell&#8208;permeable probes are capable of accessing all lifecycle stages including the disease&#8208;critical intramacrophage amastigote. Probe efficacy is a combination of both target engagement and subsequent accessibility to the affinity agent. Fourteen SHs, including peptidases and lipases, were identified in the L. mexicana proteome with comparative profiling of different parasite life&#8208;stages revealing significant changes in SH activity across the lifecycle stages. This intracellular ABPP approach provides insights into the host&#8211;parasite interactome demonstrating that SHs function as important virulence factors with Z&#8208;Pro&#8208;Prolinal, a known prolyl&#8208;oligopeptidase inhibitor, being able to reduce parasite infectivity in the macrophage by altering multiple SH targets.

         <title>Macrocycles of Saxitoxin: Insights into the Structure of Zetekitoxin AB</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 10, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic macrocycles of (+)&#8208;saxitoxin, the causative agent of paralytic shellfish poisoning, have been prepared. These are designed to mimic the macrocyclic core of the proposed structure for zetekitoxin AB. Interestingly, these synthetic macrocycles do not form the C12 hydrate as commonly observed in this family of toxins, casting doubt on the presence of a macrocycle in zetekitoxin AB.

Zeteketoxin AB is the only macrocyclic member of the bis&#8208;guanidinium ion toxins, and the only member reported to be more potent than the parent (+)&#8208;saxitoxin. A rationale for this exquisite potency remains difficult to develop due to the scarcity of natural material and a lack of consensus around the specific structure of the toxin itself. A strategy is reported, leveraging an intramolecular Michael addition to forge macrocycles bridging the saxitoxin core, mimicking the proposed structure of zetekitoxin AB. Intriguingly, these analogs do not form a hydrate at C12. Experimental and computational studies suggest that a macrocyclic framework destabilizes the hydrate, casting doubt on the presence of a macrocycle in zetekitoxin. Preliminary activity screening utilizing calcium imaging&#8208;based constellation pharmacology demonstrates several analogs to have potent pharmacological activity similar to (+)&#8208;saxitoxin despite the lack of the C12 hydrated ketone.

         <title>Identification of Key Active&#8208;Site Positions Controlling the Chemoselectivity of Aspergillus Brasiliensis Unspecific Peroxygenase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 10, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unspecific peroxygenase (UPO) from Aspergillus brasiliensis AbrUPO catalyzes the aromatic hydroxylation of substituted benzenes. By integrating structural elements from well&#8208;characterized UPOs in AbrUPO variants, position 186 was identified as a critical determinant of enzyme chemoselectivity. The A186F substitution prevents aromatic hydroxylation of substituted benzenes in favor of benzylic hydroxylation.

Heme&#8208;containing unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) have attracted significant attention as biocatalysts for oxidation reactions due to their ability to function without expensive nicotinamide cofactors. In the recent study, the UPO from aspergillus brasiliensis (AbrUPO) is found to catalyze the aromatic hydroxylation of substituted benzenes, a feature that distinguishes AbrUPO from other reported wild&#8208;type UPOs. To elucidate the underlying factors in the active site and substrate access channel of AbrUPO&#8212;which contains fewer phenylalanine residues compared to other UPOs that primarily catalyze benzylic hydroxylation&#8212;twenty two AbrUPO variants with single, double, triple, or quadruple amino acid substitutions were constructed to mimic the active sites or substrate access channels of other UPOs. A number of mutated variants exhibited altered activity and selectivity, and several positions were identified that influence enzyme chemoselectivity. Among them, substitution of alanine at position 186 with bulkier residues such as phenylalanine or leucine lead to a shift in chemoselectivity toward alkyl chain hydroxylation of substituted benzenes. Molecular docking studies indicated that the A186F mutation restricts the flexibility and reorientation of ethylbenzene in the active site of AbrUPO, thereby preventing oxidation at the aromatic ring while promoting benzylic hydroxylation.

         <title>An Indole Dearomatization Strategy for the Synthesis of Pseudo&#8208;Natural Products</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 10, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An indole&#8208;dearomatization/reduction strategy is developed to expand a collection of indole&#8208;containing pseudo&#8208;NPs. This approach enhances the three&#8208;dimensionality of the original compound classes through hybridization&#8208;changing conversions leading to topologically distinct novel structures. Morphological profiling reveals bioactivities that persist throughout the compound classes.

The indole moiety is a privileged fragment that frequently populates existing bioactive compound collections. The development of an indole&#8208;dearomatization sequence and its application for library expansion of a collection of indole&#8208;containing pseudo&#8208;natural products (NPs) are described. The resulting compounds are topologically distinct from the original compound class. Phenotyping by means of the cell painting assay initially indicates that the dearomatized compounds are morphologically different than the original pseudo&#8208;NP compound class and guiding NPs. However, analysis by means of a new subprofile analysis of the same cell painting assay data indicates that similar morphologies persist throughout the compound classes. Further biological studies support the findings of the subprofile analysis and highlight its potential to more effectively characterize novel compounds. The biological findings suggest that a plethora of indole&#8208;dearomatization reactions can be applied to existing indole&#8208;containing compound collections to rapidly access new biologically relevant scaffolds.

         <title>First Steps toward the Design of Peptides that Influence the Intracellular Palmitoylation Machinery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 10, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, DC peptides consisting of the cell&#8208;penetrating peptide sC18* and a Asp&#8211;His&#8211;His&#8211;Cys (DHHC) motif derived from human ZDHHC palmitoyltransferase are highlighted. DC peptides demonstrate high cellular internalization into various cellular models, exert cytotoxic effects against cancerous cells, and alter the function and localization of known palmitoylation substrate proteins.

Protein S&#8208;palmitoylation is a reversible posttranslational modification transferring the 16&#8208;carbon fatty acid palmitate to cysteines. It plays a critical role in many cellular processes by influencing protein function, localization, stability, and protein&#8211;protein interactions and has a significant impact on various physiological and pathological conditions. This emphasizes the need to develop new technologies to study and treat diseases associated with aberrant palmitoylation. To address these challenges, cell&#8208;permeable peptides containing an Asp&#8211;His&#8211;His&#8211;Cys (DHHC) palmitoylation motif are presented aiming to affect intracellular protein S&#8208;palmitoylation. A small library of peptides is generated and screened for cellular uptake and cell compatibility. Interestingly, the newly designed peptides internalize to high extent into different cell lines and human breast cell spheroids dependent on their palmitoylation motif. In addition, out of this screen, DC&#8208;2 is identified as very potent and this peptide is investigated in more detail concerning its impact on palmitoylated proteins that are connected to cancer progression. These initial explorations highlight that DC&#8208;2 affected the localization of HRas and altered S&#8208;palmitoylation&#8208;related signaling cascades of epidermal growth factor receptor. These findings suggest a peptide&#8208;driven impact on proteins having palmitoylation sites and highlight cell&#8208;permeable DHHC peptides as a potential tool to be further evolved in the context of palmitoylation and cancer.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, DC peptides consisting of the cell-penetrating peptide sC18* and a Asp&#8211;His&#8211;His&#8211;Cys (DHHC) motif derived from human ZDHHC palmitoyltransferase are highlighted. DC peptides demonstrate high cellular internalization into various cellular models, exert cytotoxic effects against cancerous cells, and alter the function and localization of known palmitoylation substrate proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein S-palmitoylation is a reversible posttranslational modification transferring the 16-carbon fatty acid palmitate to cysteines. It plays a critical role in many cellular processes by influencing protein function, localization, stability, and protein&#8211;protein interactions and has a significant impact on various physiological and pathological conditions. This emphasizes the need to develop new technologies to study and treat diseases associated with aberrant palmitoylation. To address these challenges, cell-permeable peptides containing an Asp&#8211;His&#8211;His&#8211;Cys (DHHC) palmitoylation motif are presented aiming to affect intracellular protein S-palmitoylation. A small library of peptides is generated and screened for cellular uptake and cell compatibility. Interestingly, the newly designed peptides internalize to high extent into different cell lines and human breast cell spheroids dependent on their palmitoylation motif. In addition, out of this screen, DC-2 is identified as very potent and this peptide is investigated in more detail concerning its impact on palmitoylated proteins that are connected to cancer progression. These initial explorations highlight that DC-2 affected the localization of HRas and altered S-palmitoylation-related signaling cascades of epidermal growth factor receptor. These findings suggest a peptide-driven impact on proteins having palmitoylation sites and highlight cell-permeable DHHC peptides as a potential tool to be further evolved in the context of palmitoylation and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Recognition Tag of Human Origin for Bioorthogonal Generation of Antibody&#8208;Drug Conjugates using Microbial Biotin Ligase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 10, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A human&#8208;derived recognition tag of Pyrococcus horikoshii biotin ligase is fused to the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab at the C&#8208;termini of either light or heavy chain. These fusion antibodies allow for the PhBL&#8208;mediated introduction of desthiobiotin azide and the subsequent attachment of DBCO&#8208;AF488 and DBCO&#8208;Val&#8208;Cit&#8208;PAB&#8208;MMAE via strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition. The generated antibody&#8208;drug conjugates exhibit single&#8208;digit nanomolar potency on Her2&#8208;expressing cell lines.

The use of enzymes, such as microbial transglutaminase, lipoate protein ligase A, or sortase A, for the generation of antibody&#8208;drug conjugates has proven to be a powerful tool for the site&#8208;specific payload conjugation to tumor&#8208;specific antibodies. Herein, the extension of this enzymatic toolbox by Pyrococcus horikoshii biotin ligase is reported. To this end, the therapeutic antibody trastuzumab is equipped with p67, the 67 amino acid carboxyl&#8208;terminal domain of human propionyl&#8208;CoA carboxylase &#945; subunit, at the C&#8208;terminus of either the light or heavy chain (Trz&#8208;LC:p67 and Trz&#8208;HC:p67). Upon incubation with PhBL, the azide&#8208;bearing linker desthiobiotin azide is site&#8208;specifically coupled to the p67 domains at the antibody. Subsequent strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition with DBCO&#8208;AF488 and DBCO&#8208;Val&#8208;Cit&#8208;PAB&#8208;MMAE yielded conjugates near to full conversion. In cellular assays, these constructs exhibit single&#8208;digit nanomolar EC50 values in cellular proliferation assays on SK&#8208;BR&#8208;3 and A431 cells, where no significant difference in the performance between the two variants Trz&#8208;LC:p67&#8208;MMAE and Trz&#8208;HC:p67&#8208;MMAE is observed. On high Fc&#8208;&#947;IIIa receptor expressing Jurkat cells, Trz&#8208;HC:p67&#8208;MMAE exhibits higher potency than Trz&#8208;LC:p67&#8208;MMAE, indicating an Fc&#8208;blocking effect of p67 when fused to the light chain.

         <title>Preorganized Electric Fields in Voltage&#8208;Gated Sodium Channels</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 10, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charged and uncharged polar residues in ion channels are preorganized to generate electric fields that align water molecules in the pore and facilitate ion dynamics. These electric fields emanate primarily from charge&#8211;dipole and charge&#8211;charge interactions.

Enzymes are reported to catalyze reactions by generating electric fields that promote the evolution of the reaction in the active site. Although seldom used outside enzymatic catalysis, electrostatic preorganization theory and language of electric fields can be generalized to other biological macromolecules. Herein, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of human Nav1.5, Nav1.6, and Nav1.7 with the&#160;atomic multipole optmimized energetics for biomolecular applications &#160;polarizable force field. We show that in the absence of an external potential, charged and uncharged residues generate strong electric fields that assist in Na+ motion in the pore. This work emphasizes the importance of charge&#8211;dipole interactions in modulating Na+ dynamics, in addition to charge&#8211;charge interactions, the focus of a majority of previous studies. Finally, we find that residues share a high level of mutual information through electric fields that can enable the optimization of allosteric pathways.

The cover picture illustrates the reversible transformation of wireframe polyhedral DNA origami, transitioning between an open&#8208;form and a closed&#8208;form with protruding vertices. Spacer strands between vertices and edges introduce vertex&#8208;specific flexibility, enabling designed vertex protrusion. The transformation is driven by DNA hybridization and strand displacement reactions, allowing the structure to switch reversibly between its open and closed states. More details can be found in article 10.1002/cbic.202401071 by Yusuke Sato and co&#8208;workers.

Directed Evolution of Fluorescent Genetically Encoded Biosensors: Innovative Approaches for Development and Optimization of Biosensors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 10, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directed evolution significantly facilitates development of genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors, enabling the development of brighter and more specific biosensors. Novel methods enhance screening processes, decrease resources and costs, and integrate machine learning for optimized outcomes. Promising directions include near&#8208;infrared and photochromic biosensors, alongside de&#8201;novo design of sensing domains.

Fluorescent protein&#8208;based biosensors are indispensable molecular tools in cell biology and biomedical research, providing non&#8208;invasive dynamic measurements of metabolite concentrations and other cellular signals. Traditional methods for developing these biosensors rely on rational design, but directed evolution methods offer a more efficient alternative. This review discusses recent advancements in the development of biosensors using directed evolution, including methods for optimizing domain fusions, sequence optimization, and new screening and selection systems. Additionally, the incorporation of machine learning into the directed evolution process is explored, highlighting its potential to enhance the efficiency and cost reduction of biosensor development. Finally, emerging trends in the development of near&#8208;infrared biosensors and photochromic sensors are discussed, along with the opportunities presented by de&#8201;novo design of sensing domains and biosensors.

         <title>Bioapplications of Cell Membrane Engineering with DNA Nanotechnology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 10, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review introduces the advancements in DNA nanotechnology&#8208;based strategies for cell membrane engineering. It covers the summary of strategies for functionalization of DNA nanomaterials on cell membranes and the applications of cell&#8208;based biomedicine. The DNA&#8208;based nongenetic approach to engineering cell membranes holds great promise in the field of cell&#8208;based diagnostic and therapeutic.

         <title>Recent Advances in Enzymes and Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Tetrasaccharide Linkage Region of Proteoglycans</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 10, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tetrasaccharide linkage region of proteoglycans is synthesized through a series of well&#8208;controlled enzymatic reactions in nature. The expression, activity, and substrate profile of these biosynthetic enzymes and the latest development of chemoenzymatic synthesis of linkage region&#8208;bearing glycopeptides are summarized in this review.

Proteoglycans (PGs) play roles in many important biological events, including growth factor signaling, wound repair, blood coagulation, brain development, and neural stem cell migration. As the glycosaminoglycan chain of PGs is attached to the core protein through a tetrasaccharide linkage region, it is important to decipher the intricate control of the multitude of enzymes engaged in biosynthesis of the linkage region. During the past two decades, significant advances have been achieved in our understanding of the identity and interactions of these enzymes as well as the control of their activities. Furthermore, the knowledge gained on biosynthesis of the linkage region has enabled the synthesis of structurally well&#8208;defined proteoglycan&#8208;associated glycopeptides. The expression, activity, and substrate profile of enzymes and the latest development of chemoenzymatic synthesis of linkage region&#8208;bearing glycopeptides are summarized in this review.

         <title>The Molecular Toolbox for Linkage Type&#8208;Specific Analysis of Ubiquitin Signaling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 10, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ubiquitin modifications regulate virtually all aspects of eukaryotic cell biology through an array of polyubiquitin chain signals that adopt distinct structures, enabling the individual polyubiquitin linkages to mediate specific functions in cells. Herein, molecular tools available for enrichment, detection, and characterization of linkage type&#8208;specific ubiquitin signaling, are reviewed.

Modification of proteins and other biomolecules with ubiquitin regulates virtually all aspects of eukaryotic cell biology. Ubiquitin can be attached to substrates as a monomer or as an array of polyubiquitin chains with defined linkages between the ubiquitin moieties. Each ubiquitin linkage type adopts a distinct structure, enabling the individual linkage types to mediate specific functions or outcomes in the cell. The dynamics, heterogeneity, and in some cases low abundance, make analysis of linkage type&#8208;specific ubiquitin signaling a challenging and complex task. Herein, the strategies and molecular tools available for enrichment, detection, and characterization of linkage type&#8208;specific ubiquitin signaling, are reviewed. The molecular &#8220;toolbox&#8221; consists of a range of molecularly different affinity reagents, including antibodies and antibody&#8208;like molecules, affimers, engineered ubiquitin&#8208;binding domains, catalytically inactive deubiquitinases, and macrocyclic peptides, each with their unique characteristics and binding modes. The molecular engineering of these ubiquitin&#8208;binding molecules makes them useful tools and reagents that can be coupled to a range of analytical methods, such as immunoblotting, fluorescence microscopy, mass spectrometry&#8208;based proteomics, or enzymatic analyses to aid in deciphering the ever&#8208;expanding complexity of ubiquitin modifications.

         <title>Engineering of Small Ribozymes Acting on RNA: What is Needed to Make a New Function Work with an Existing Catalyst?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 10, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational design is a potent strategy for developing ribozymes with advanced functionalities. Engineered variants of the hairpin ribozyme impressively demonstrate how function can be tuned through structural manipulation.

The engineering of nucleic acids has been a longstanding objective in research, with the field gaining significant attention following the discovery of ribozymes in the early 1980s. Numerous nucleic acid catalysts have been developed to catalyze a wide range of reactions, and the structures of ribozymes have been modified to allow allosteric regulation by an external cofactor. All these constructs hold considerable promise for applications in biosensors for medical and environmental diagnostics, as well as in molecular tools for regulating cellular processes. In addition to the development of nucleic acid enzymes through in&#8201;vitro selection, rational design offers a robust strategy for engineering ribozymes with customized properties. The structures and mechanisms of numerous nucleic acid catalysts have been thoroughly elucidated, making structural modulation a viable approach for designing their functional properties. Rational design necessitates the consideration of several parameters, and a range of tools is available to guide sequence design. This review discusses sequence, structural, and functional design, primarily using the example of the hairpin ribozyme, to highlight the challenges and opportunities of rational nucleic acid enzyme engineering.

Cationic Polymers for Gene Delivery: Properties and Functional Optimization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 10, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, three types of cationic polymers, the nonbiodegradable polymers polyethyleneimine and polyamidoamine, the biodegradable natural polymers chitosan and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin , and the biodegradable synthetic polymers poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester)s, are reviewed. The modification of these cationic polymers includes four general strategies, which improve the overall performance of gene carriers.

Developing safe and efficient nucleic acid delivery systems has been a major challenge for gene therapy. Cationic polymers, with their easily modifiable chemical structure and high nucleic acid loading capacity, can meet a wide range of needs for gene delivery. Research on using these polymers as gene delivery vectors is rapidly developing. In this paper, cationic polymers are briefly categorized into three types: nonbiodegradable polymers, biodegradable natural polymers, and biodegradable synthetic polymers. Among these three types, several representative delivery carriers are selected to be discussed in detail, which are polyethyleneimine, polyamidoamine, chitosan, &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin, and poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester)s. The physicochemical properties and structure optimization strategies of these representative types of carriers are outlined. The deficiencies and common major modification strategies of these vectors are summarized in comparison, which can provide new ideas for the design and development of cationic polymer gene vectors in the future.

         <title>Sulfur(IV) Chemistry&#8208;Based Peptide and Protein Late&#8208;Stage Modification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 10, May 27, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the applications of sulfur(IV)&#8208;based modifying reagents, modification products, or reactive intermediates in the late&#8208;stage modification of peptides and proteins, as well as their therapeutic implementations in proximity&#8208;induced bioconjugation, drug delivery systems, and related biomedical fields.

The development of precise and controllable chemical modification tools for peptides and proteins represents a great challenge in elucidating their structure&#8211;activity relationships and regulatory mechanisms, as well as a powerful driver for advancing macromolecular therapeutic strategies. However, current technologies predominantly rely on irreversible covalent labeling or genetic encoding of unnatural amino acids, exhibiting significant limitations in reversible modification, in&#8201;situ functional regulation, and adaptability to complex physiological environments. In recent years, breakthrough advancements in sulfur(IV) chemistry have provided a paradigm for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides and proteins. Through synergistic innovations in sulfur(IV)&#8208;based reagent design, intermediate modulation, and bioorthogonal reactions, a more multifaceted modification toolbox has been progressively established, integrating site selectivity, condition responsiveness, and functional rescue. Providing current challenges and future perspectives in this field, this review focuses on sulfur(IV) chemistry&#8208;driven strategies for peptide and protein modification, as well as their applications in proximity&#8208;labeling strategies and drug delivery/therapeutic interventions.

&lt;p&gt;The development of precise and controllable chemical modification tools for peptides and proteins represents a great challenge in elucidating their structure&#8211;activity relationships and regulatory mechanisms, as well as a powerful driver for advancing macromolecular therapeutic strategies. However, current technologies predominantly rely on irreversible covalent labeling or genetic encoding of unnatural amino acids, exhibiting significant limitations in reversible modification, &lt;i&gt;in&#8201;situ&lt;/i&gt; functional regulation, and adaptability to complex physiological environments. In recent years, breakthrough advancements in sulfur(IV) chemistry have provided a paradigm for the late-stage functionalization of peptides and proteins. Through synergistic innovations in sulfur(IV)-based reagent design, intermediate modulation, and bioorthogonal reactions, a more multifaceted modification toolbox has been progressively established, integrating site selectivity, condition responsiveness, and functional rescue. Providing current challenges and future perspectives in this field, this review focuses on sulfur(IV) chemistry-driven strategies for peptide and protein modification, as well as their applications in proximity-labeling strategies and drug delivery/therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diversity of ThDP&#8208;Dependent Enzymes Forming Chiral Tertiary Alcohols</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral tertiary alcohols are widespread in nature and bioactive compounds; however, their asymmetric synthesis faces several challenges. This review outlines the toolbox of ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes able to produce tertiary alcohols through the formation of C&#63743;C bond formation using ketones as acceptor substrates. Herein, the substrate scope, the diversity of physiological functions, and future perspectives are emphasized.

Thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)&#8208;dependent enzymes are well known biocatalysts for C&#63743;C bond&#8211;forming reactions. While this enzyme class is mainly investigated for the formation of acyloins of secondary alcohols, recent studies have expanded its scope to utilize ketones as electrophiles in asymmetric carboligation reactions for the formation of tertiary alcohols. Chiral tertiary alcohols are ubiquitous motifs in natural products and important building blocks for the synthesis of bioactive compounds. ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes are emerging as one of the most promising classes of biocatalysts for synthesizing a wide range of products due to the variety of possible substrate combinations, accessible starting materials, high enantioselectivity, and advantageous self&#8208;regeneration of the catalytic ThDP cofactor. This review provides an overview of the ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes (e.g., decarboxylase, DC; transketolase, TK; &#945;&#8208;keto acid dehydrogenase 2, &#945;KADH2) that form tertiary alcohols, focusing on the substrate scope and diversity of physiological functions. The available toolbox and the characterized reactions shall serve as a starting point for future studies. Inspired by nature, an even broader diversity of classes and substrate specificities is expected in this field.

         <title>Macromolecular High&#8208;Affinity Binding Probed by Advanced Fluorescence Techniques</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the extreme sensitivity and the intrinsic selectivity of fluorescence techniques, high&#8208;affinity binding can be measured even at extremely low molecule concentrations in the picomolar range. In particular, modern advanced techniques with fluorescence microscopes have provided considerable methodological advancements in recent years. Here, we provide a brief description of the basic physical principles of fluorescence detection and its experimental measurement setups. For interacting biomolecules in solution, confocal fluorescence microscopy in particular enables some very effective approaches to characterize binding in complex sample environments and with small sample consumption. In addition to standard techniques with bulk samples in classical spectrometers, applications with single molecule FRET, two&#8208;colour coincidence detection and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy are presented. The strength of the more advanced techniques lies in their broad applicability, ranging from fluorescence&#8208;based genetically encoded biosensors for use in living cells to the high controllability in the measurement of binding curves even at very low molecule concentrations. The advantages and limitations of the individual techniques are compared and recent state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembly of Branched Chain Amino Acids to Toxic Fibrils may be Related to Pathogenesis of Maple Syrup Urine Disease</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs)&#160;lead&#160;to the buildup of metabolites that are typically toxic or disrupt normal cellular function. The etiological relation of metabolic disorders has been uncovered through the study of metabolite amyloids. Various metabolites that accumulate in IEMs have been reported to self&#8208;assemble into organized structures. These structures exhibit similar physicochemical properties as proteinaceous amyloid fibrils. In this context, our study illustrated the aggregation properties of Branched chain amino acid (BCAA) i.e. Isoleucine, Leucine and Valine that accumulate in Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) to investigate their propensities to assemble into amyloid&#8208;like fibrils. The structural morphologies of BCAA were studied via. microscopic techniques like Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), optical microscopy and phase contrast microscopy. Further, characterization techniques were employed to understand the physicochemical properties of the self&#8208;assemblies and its underlying mechanism. The amyloid&#8208;like nature of these aggregates was confirmed using Thioflavin T (ThT) and Congo Red (CR) assays, indicating a possible cytotoxic effect. The MTT assay reveals BCAAs were cytotoxic and significantly decrease cell viability. Our study plays a key role in understanding the physicochemical properties of MSUD in association to amyloid disease, possibly paving the way for the development of therapeutic solutions in the future.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Non&#8208;muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) accounts for 75% of bladder cancer cases, with Bacillus Calmette&#8208;Gu&#233;rin (BCG) immunotherapy as the gold standard for high&#8208;risk patients. BCG elicits a robust immune response but is limited by adverse effects and resistance. To enhance its efficacy, we developed a trehalose&#8208;based conjugation strategy, tethering a cytostatic agent to BCG via a cleavable disulfide linker. This system enables selective drug integration into the BCG envelope and controlled release in tumor cells, aiming to improve therapeutic precision while minimizing toxicity. This approach combines immunotherapy with targeted chemotherapy, offering a promising strategy for NMIBC treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyanophenylalanine as an Infrared Probe for Iron&#8211;Sulfur Cluster Redox State in Multicenter Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The noncanonical amino acid, cyanophenylalanine, is genetically inserted close to iron&#8211;sulfur clusters of either spinach ferredoxin or iron&#8211;iron hydrogenase, and functions as an infrared spectroscopic reporter for changes in cluster redox state.

The noncanonical amino acid, para&#8208;cyanophenylalanine (CNF), when incorporated into metalloproteins, functions as an infrared spectroscopic probe for the redox state of iron&#8208;sulfur clusters, offering a strategy for determining electron occupancy in the electron transport chains of complex metalloenzymes. A redshift of &#8776;1&#8211;2&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in the nitrile (NC) stretching frequency is observed, following reduction of spinach ferredoxin modified to contain CNF close to its [2Fe&#8211;2S] center, and this shift is reversed on re&#8208;oxidation. We extend this to CNF positioned near to the proximal [4Fe&#8211;4S] cluster of the [FeFe] hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans. In combination with a distal [4Fe&#8211;4S] cluster and the [4Fe&#8211;4S] cluster of the active site &#8216;H&#8208;cluster&#8217; ([4Fe&#8211;4S]H), the proximal cluster forms an electron relay connecting the active site to the surface of the protein. Again, a reversible shift in wavenumber for CNF is observed, following cluster reduction in either apo&#8208;protein (containing the iron&#8208;sulfur clusters but lacking the active site) or holo&#8208;protein with intact active site, demonstrating the general applicability of this approach to studying complex metalloenzymes.

         <title>Photoactivatable Alkyne Tag for Photolabeling Biomolecules in Living Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoactivatable linear alkyne tag is developed by caging the intermediate of the Eschenmoser&#8211;Tanabe reaction to expand photoinduced intracellular molecular imaging to a variety of biomolecules. The photoactivatable tag is modified onto a cholesterol analog and introduced into cells. After light irradiation, the tag is successfully labeled with azide&#8208;functionalized fluorescent dye, achieving photoinduced intracellular molecular imaging.

Light&#8208;induced molecular imaging methods have attracted considerable attention owing to their potential for monitoring changes in the localization of intracellular molecules, which can provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of living systems. In this article, a photoactivatable alkyne tag is developed by modifying an unstable intermediate of the alkyne&#8208;forming reaction with a photodegradable protecting group; the photodegradation triggers the conversion of the intermediate into a linear alkyne in an aqueous solution. The developed photoactivatable alkyne tag is incorporated into a cholesterol analog, introduced into living cells, and exposed to a biocompatible dose of 365&#8201;nm light. Subsequently, the cholesterol analog in light&#8208;irradiated cells is microscopically visualized through alkyne&#8208;specific biotinylation via copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition and biotin&#8208;specific labeling with fluorescence&#8208;labeled streptavidin. The obtained results indicate that the photoactivatable alkyne tag can be photoconverted into alkyne derivatives inside cells and applied to the light&#8208;induced intracellular imaging of biomolecules. This photoactivatable chemical tag can potentially expand the range of applications of light&#8208;induced molecular imaging of various biomolecules.

         <title>The Advancement of Prime Editing Technology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically summarizes current optimization strategies for prime editing (PE), focusing on protein engineering, pegRNA modifications, cellular factor recruitment, and paired pegRNA approaches. The review evaluates their performance across applications, discusses existing limitations, and outlines future directions, providing a comprehensive framework to support the next&#8208;generation development of PE technologies.

The advent of CRISPR/Cas genome editing has spurred major breakthroughs across life sciences, offering vast potential across numerous research and application fields. Among the expanding toolkit of CRISPR/Cas&#8208;derived methods, prime editing (PE) stands out for its versatility and specificity, enabling precise point mutations and small insertions or deletions without requiring double&#8208;stranded DNA breaks. Since its introduction, PE has undergone multiple rounds of optimization to improve performance. In this review, the core components and mechanism of prime editors, followed by four key evolution strategies: protein engineering, pegRNA modifications, accessory protein recruitment, and paired pegRNA approaches are outlined. Further persistent challenges and outline possible refinements are discussed, highlighting how further innovations can expand PE's utility across diverse areas of research, biotechnology, and potential therapeutic interventions.

         <title>Chemical Switching: A Concept Inspired by Strategies from Biocatalysis and Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical Switching is introduced as a novel technology that exploits the promiscuity of enzymatic transformations by applying small molecule organocatalytic switches (ORCAs) or gain&#8208;of&#8208;function protein variants. The modulation of underlying chemical principles thereby amplifies low&#8208;rate or installs otherwise absent enzymatic activities to dominate cellular functions. The approach offers manifold mechanistic angles for impact and opportunities in the treatment of disease.

In this perspective the character of aldehyde functional groups is outlined as central intermediates in DNA repair. As highly reactive entities, aldehydes exist in limited quantities and in contextualized scenarios only and are commonly masked as a Schiff base. Recent advances reveal that principles of organic chemistry can modulate the enzymatic cleavage of Schiff bases, a process termed chemical switching. This approach not only enhances the production of canonical DNA repair products, bolstering cellular function, but also generates novel reaction intermediates, potentially rewiring cellular pathways. However, such rewiring could increase the complexity and toxicity of DNA repair intermediates, influencing therapeutic outcomes. To shape novel classes of therapeutics, an exploitation of these fine&#8208;tuned reaction principles requires expertise of enzymologists and scientists skilled in bio&#8208; and organocatalysis. Here, the current state of the art is outlined in chemically switching enzymatic function in cells with focus on DNA repair, highlighting challenges of this new type of protein modulation and discussing possible solutions. This paints a picture of the chemical switching concept as an emerging playing field with exciting translational prospects.

         <title>A tailored phospho&#8208;p53 library probes antibody&#160;specificity and recognition limitations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tumour suppressor protein p53, known as the "guardian of the genome", is regulated by a complex network of posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Phosphorylations at 7 Ser/Thr residues within the N&#8208;terminal transactivation domain 1 (TAD1) play a role in p53 activation, yet their precise mechanisms of action remain elusive due to challenges in accessing well&#8208;defined phosphorylated isoforms. To address this limitation, we harness our recently developed approach for the semisynthesis of site&#8208;specifically phosphorylated p53 to generate a comprehensive library of singly phosphorylated p53 including all TAD1 sites: Ser6, Ser9, Ser15, Thr18, Ser20, Ser33 and Ser37. We then utilize this library to probe the specificity of common p53 antibodies in western blot analysis. Our results confirm the specificity of the target site of most phosphorylation&#8208;specific anti&#8208;p53 antibodies, but also reveal wide&#8208;spread epitope masking by phosphorylation, which has implications for p53 research and diagnostics. Our library provides a toolkit to study the function of p53 phosphorylation directly and indirectly as a quality control agent for some of the most widely used reagents in the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective [9&#8208;15N] Guanosine for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Studies of Large Ribonucleic Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The small chemical shift anisotropy of nitrogen&#8208;15 at the 9&#8208;position in guanine (15N9&#8208;G) leads to long T2 values and narrow NMR lines, particularly &#160; attractive to probe structure and dynamics of large (&gt;200 nucleotide) ribonucleic acids (RNAs). 

RNAs regulate various cellular processes using malleable 3D structures, and understanding the factors that control RNA structure and dynamics is critical for understanding their mechanisms of action. To mitigate factors that have limited studies of large, functionally relevant RNAs by solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we have extended a recently described 2H&#8208;enhanced, 1H&#8208;15N correlation approach&#160;that used uniformly 15N&#8208;labeled guanosine triphosphate (GTP) by developing a chemoenzymatic labeling technology that grafts selectively labeled [9&#8208;15N]&#8208;Guanine on to any labeled ribose to make [9&#8208;15N]&#8208;GTP. The approach exploits advantageous NMR properties of the N9 nucleus which, when combined with extensive ribose deuteration and optimized NMR pulse sequences, affords sharp signals without complications that can arise using uniform [15N]&#8208;guanine labeling. The utility of the approach for NMR signal assignment and dynamics analysis is demonstrated for three large RNAs (20&#8211;78&#8201;kDa) that play critical roles in viral replication. With this approach, NMR studies of RNAs comprising 200&#8201;nt or more should now be feasible.

         <title>Tagatose&#8208;1,6&#8208;Bisphosphate Aldolases, the Unloved DHAP&#8208;Aldolases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tagatose&#8208;1,6&#8208;bisphosphate aldolases (TagAs) have been understudied, with few available publications reporting poor stereoselectivity. This leads to their classification as the less promising aldolases. The aim of this concept is to revisit these findings and uncover inconsistencies to better understand their true potential. It is believed that, with further exploration, TagAs can prove as valuable as other aldolases in catalyzing stereoselective reactions.

Tagatose&#8208;1,6&#8208;bisphosphate aldolases (TagA) have been understudied. The limited publications on the subject report a poor stereoselectivity, which quickly leads to their classification among the less interesting aldolases. This conclusion, which appears inadequate, discourages further investigation by other researchers. The objective here is to re&#8208;examine all these studies in detail to finally uncover inconsistencies and unexplained observations regarding the behavior of these enzymes. Ultimately, there is a significant lack of research that can deepen the understanding of TagA, which will likely reveal its potential to be as valuable as its counterparts: fructose&#8208;1,6&#8208;bisphosphate, rhamnulose&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate, and fuculose&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate aldolases.

     alt="Tagatose-1,6-Bisphosphate Aldolases, the Unloved DHAP-Aldolases"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tagatose-1,6-&lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;phosphate aldolases (TagAs) have been understudied, with few available publications reporting poor stereoselectivity. This leads to their classification as the less promising aldolases. The aim of this concept is to revisit these findings and uncover inconsistencies to better understand their true potential. It is believed that, with further exploration, TagAs can prove as valuable as other aldolases in catalyzing stereoselective reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tagatose-1,6-&lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;phosphate aldolases (TagA) have been understudied. The limited publications on the subject report a poor stereoselectivity, which quickly leads to their classification among the less interesting aldolases. This conclusion, which appears inadequate, discourages further investigation by other researchers. The objective here is to re-examine all these studies in detail to finally uncover inconsistencies and unexplained observations regarding the behavior of these enzymes. Ultimately, there is a significant lack of research that can deepen the understanding of TagA, which will likely reveal its potential to be as valuable as its counterparts: fructose-1,6-&lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;phosphate, rhamnulose-1-phosphate, and fuculose-1-phosphate aldolases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gas Microbubble Formation via Near&#8208;Infrared Femtosecond Laser Ablation in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A focused femtosecond laser induces photochemical decomposition of intracellular molecules, generating gas microbubbles. The microbubbles form at lower energy inside cell monolayers than in the surrounding medium. This enables the creation of acellular zones for motility assays to evaluate anticancer drugs. Apigenin inhibits motility of A549 lung cancer cells and induces actin filament disassembly.

Focused near&#8208;infrared femtosecond laser irradiation induces efficient photochemical breakdown of intracellular molecules, resulting in the formation of gas microbubbles that ultimately lead to cell death and removal. This study characterizes these microbubbles using high&#8208;speed imaging. Microbubbles generated within cells by single&#8208;pulse irradiation are consistently larger than those formed in the surrounding culture medium across a broad pulse energy range. Notably, the energy threshold for intracellular microbubble formation is several tens of nanojoules lower than in the culture medium, enabling precise cell ablation without inducing extracellular bubbling. Repeated pulse irradiation at 1&#8201;kHz frequency further reduces the energy threshold and increases bubble size, with saturation observed after &#8776;30 pulses. Near&#8208;threshold pulse irradiation is then employed to develop a precise method for investigating cellular motility in&#8201;vitro. Cell&#8208;free zones are created within cell monolayers, enabling motile cells to migrate into the cleared zones. This method is validated using the A549 lung cancer cell line and the plant flavonoid apigenin, which exhibits dose&#8208;dependent reduction in A549 cell motility. These findings highlight the method's potential for evaluating cellular behaviors and screening chemical compounds.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Fungal Cyclic Lipodepsipeptide Pleosporacin, a New Selective Inhibitor of the Phytopathogen Botrytis cinerea</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioactivity&#8208;guided isolation led to the discovery of a potent and selective inhibitor of the phytopathogen Botrytis cinerea, pleosporacin (1), from mycelia extracts of the fungal strain Pleosporales sp. IBWF 020&#8208;21. The biosynthesis of the nonribosomal cyclic lipodepsipeptide 1 was elucidated via heterologous reconstitution in Aspergillus oryzae.

Bioactivity&#8208;guided isolation led to the identification of the cyclic lipodepsipeptide pleosporacin (1) from the mycelia extract of fungal strain Pleosporales sp. IBWF 020&#8208;21, a potent selective inhibitor of the fungal phytopathogen Botrytis cinerea. The structure and stereochemistry of 1 were elucidated by NMR and Marfey analysis, respectively. Genome mining identified a candidate biosynthetic gene cluster encoding a hexamodular nonribosomal peptide synthetases, PleA, a fatty acyl&#8208;AMP ligase, PleB, and an aspartate decarboxylase, PleC. Reconstitution of pleABC allowed for heterologous production of 1 in Aspergillus oryzae and confirmed the identity of the ple cluster. Based on these&#160;findings a biosynthetic route is proposed, with PleB catalyzing lipoinitiation and PleC providing the nonproteinogenic amino acid &#946;&#8208;alanine for the assembly of 1.

         <dc:description>The molecular design of inhibitors against intracellular protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs) is of interest for drug discovery and chemical biology. Here, we designed a novel cyclized helix&#8208;loop&#8208;helix (cHLH) peptide that inhibited the intracellular PPI between estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#945;) and coactivator SRC1. The peptide, cHLH&#8208;ER&#945;, bound to ER&#945; and inhibited the interaction between ER&#945; and the coactivator SRC1. Cellular imaging and yeast reporter assays showed that cHLH&#8208;ER&#945; penetrated the cell membrane and exhibited antagonistic activity against ER&#945;&#8208;SRC1 to inhibit the growth of a breast cancer cell.</dc:description>

         <title>Galactose&#8208;Functionalized Gold Nanoparticles Targeting Membrane Transporters for the Glutathione Delivery to Brain Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glutathione (GSH), a tripeptide essential for maintaining redox balance in the human body, plays a critical role in protecting cells from oxidative stress. A deficiency in GSH is linked to increased oxidative damage and the progression of various disorders, including cancer and neurological diseases. In this study, we developed gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) coated with GSH and further functionalized with galactose moieties to selectively target glucose transporters (GLUT), which is overexpressed on the surface of the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and could be exploited for the selective recognition and internalization of the Au@GSH&#8208;Gal NPs, that could then exert an antioxidant effect. As a proof of concept, brain cancer cells were treated with Au@GSH&#8208;Gal NPs, evidencing their increased internalization and a significant reduction of H2O2&#8208;induced oxidative stress.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Basis of Regioselective Bromination of Tricyclic Tryptoline by the Tryptophan Halogenase Thal</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases (FDHs) carry out substrate&#8208;specific and regioselective halogenation reactions in the biosynthesis of various halogenated natural compounds. Several FDHs convert non&#8208;native substrates in vitro. However, obtaining experimental structures of FDHs with non&#8208;native substrates remains challenging and docking often produces ambiguous results. Hence, there is a lack of data on how non&#8208;native substrates bind to FDHs. Here, we show that the tryptophan 6&#8208;halogenase Thal efficiently brominates the tricyclic indole derivative tryptoline (1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carboline) with high regioselectivity. The two point mutations G113S and G469S improve regioselectivity even further. A crystal structure reveals how tryptoline binds to the active site of Thal. The halogenated carbons are located close to the catalytic lysine and the NH of tryptoline&#8217;s tetrahydropyridine is positioned like the amino group of the native substrate tryptophan. The substrate binding loop of Thal is closed, again resembling the binding of tryptophan. Our work extends the range of non&#8208;native substrates accepted by Thal, confirming the versatility of this FDH. Moreover, it is a rare example of an FDH structure in complex with a non&#8208;native substrate.</dc:description>

In this direction, we explored the self&#8208;assembling potential of a minimalist bioactive sequence (YWTD) derived from one of the essential bridging proteins of ECM, i.e., entactin. However, at physiological pH, the negative charge of the aspartate residue induced strong intermolecular repulsion that prevented the self&#8208;assembly of the peptide monomers. Interestingly, the peptide formed self&#8208;supporting hydrogels at a slightly acidic pH i.e., pH 6.2 through surface charge neutralization, thereby minimizing the repulsive interaction. Since, we aim to explore its use in controlling cellular adhesion and proliferation, we utilized the buffering capacity of the media to adjust the pH of the gel to physiological levels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on self&#8208;assembly of a novel bioactive sequence derived from the G3 domain of entactin protein. These hydrogels self&#8208;assembled at physiological pH displayed a nanofibrous structure with tuneable mechanical stiffness, which were biocompatible towards fibroblast cells. An improved cellular adhesion, and proliferation was evident within this novel matrix and thus proving it as suitable biomaterial with future potential in the field of biomedicine.</dc:description>

Hydrocarbon Stapling Enables Improvement of Antimicrobial Activity and Proteolytic Stability of Host&#8208;Defense Peptide Ocellatin&#8208;3N</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this research, a series of hydrocarbon&#8208;stable analogs of Oce&#8208;3N&#8208;0 are synthesized and evaluated for their chemical and biological properties to improve potential application of Oce&#8208;3N&#8208;0 in the field of antimicrobial drug development. The stapled peptide Oce&#8208;3N&#8208;5 shows promising prospects for novel antimicrobial drug development. This study can provide a reference for the development of antimicrobial drugs.

Ocellatin&#8208;3N is a cationic, amphiphilic host&#8208;defense peptide with 19 residues, which is isolated from the Caribbean frog Leptodactylus nesiotus. Its analogue Oce&#8208;3N&#8208;0 shows potent inhibitory activity against both Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive pathogens, and has great potential as a broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial agent. However, the application of Oce&#8208;3N&#8208;0 as an antimicrobial agent is limited due to its both unstable structure and susceptibility to degradation by proteases. In this research, a series of hydrocarbon&#8208;stable analogs of Oce&#8208;3N&#8208;0 are synthesized and evaluated for their chemical and biological properties to improve potential application of Oce&#8208;3N&#8208;0 in the field of antimicrobial drug development. Some analogs show remarkable improvement not only in protease resistance but also in antimicrobial activity when compared to the parent peptide. In particular, the stapled peptide Oce&#8208;3N&#8208;5 shows promising prospects for novel antimicrobial drug development. This study can provide a reference for the development of antimicrobial drugs.

         <title>Hazelnut: Explorations towards the biocatalytic synthesis of its aroma precursor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biocatalysis has gained significant industrial interest due to its controlled stereoselectivity and use of mild process conditions. Here we propose a biosynthetic route for the synthesis of filbertone (5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;hepten&#8208;4&#8208;one, 1), which is the principal flavour compound of hazelnut. The enantiomeric purity of the industrially synthesized compound is defined, contrary to the natural aroma, which varies according to the source of the nut extraction conditions and treatments. The novel synthetic pathway for a hazelnut aroma precursor proposed here consists of a multi&#8208;enzyme cascade, which starts from the two amino acids D&#8208;Ile and L&#8208;Thr that are individually converted by enzyme catalysts, i.e., D&#8208;amino acid oxidase and threonine deaminase, followed by C&#8208;C ligation of the obtained products allowing a potentially sustainable production of the natural aroma. The most critical step is C&#8208;C ligation that uses two carbonyl compounds as starting material. This step is catalysed by a regioselective transketolase (TK) that originates from Geobacillus stearothermophilus. Our approach holds promise for an industrial production of natural hazelnut aroma precursor, addressing the growing demand in the aroma industry for synthesis methods that sustain the regulatory claims for natural compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering NADH oxidase for regeneration of oxidized non&#8208;natural cofactor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and its reduced form NADH are universal redox cofactors and thus manipulating NAD(H) supply often leads to unpredictable outcome because of metabolic crosstalk. To overcome intrinsic limitations associated to natural cofactors, we previously introduced nicotinamide cytosine dinucleotide (NCD+) as a non&#8208;natural cofactor for redox biochemistry. While several enzymes have been devised to generate NCDH as driving force at the expense of cheap chemicals for reductive metabolic reactions, it remains inaccessible to generate NCD+ for oxidative reactions. In this study, we engineered a H2O&#8208;forming NADH oxidase (EfNOX) from Enterococcus faecalis to favor NCDH. Compared to the wild type enzyme, the best mutant NOX&#8208;KRGT oxidized NCDH with 14 and 107 folds higher catalytic efficiency and selectivity, respectively. Docking analysis showed that those mutations acquired a narrower cofactor binding cavity and positively charged environment contributing to the preference toward NCDH. Coupling NOX mutants with NCD&#8208;favoring phosphite dehydrogenase mutant enabled Escherichia coli BW14329 to utilize phosphite as sole phosphorus source for growth. Our work provides a traceless and effective tool to convert NCDH into NCD+, which should greatly expand our capacity in developing NCD&#8208;linked redox subsystems and further facilitate the implementation of non&#8208;natural cofactors in chemical biology and synthetic biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Photochemical Biology of Serotonin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Serotonin (5&#8208;HT) is an endogenous neurotransmitter that plays a key role in cellular signaling. Its interactions with serotonin receptors (5&#8208;HTRs) and the serotonin transporter (SERT) influence processes as disparate as hunger, happiness, healing, and headaches. Over the last several decades, photochemical tools have been developed to observe, track, and modulate these serotonin&#8208;protein interactions. The tools tend to fit into one of four categories: photoswitches, photocages, photobiosensors, or photocross&#8208;linkers. In this review, we examine the development and application of these photochemical tools for 5&#8208;HT, 5&#8208;HTRs, and SERT over the last ca. 10 years with an emphasis on the chemistry involved.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing the Proteome with Chemical Tools: Degrons and Beyond</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell biology relies on precise changes in protein stability, which can be chemically harnessed to transform cell fate. Decades of research have revealed the many intricate systems underlying cellular proteostasis, which can be hijacked by proximity&#8208;based degrader compounds. The archetypal degrader, PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC), recruits E3 ligases to protein targets to facilitate their ubiquitination and degradation in the proteasome. Being able to customize the human proteome with chemical tools has great value for fundamental research and for clinical progress through the controlled elimination of disease&#8208;causing proteins. Success within the degrader field has reinvigorated interest in mapping the mechanisms underlying native protein degradation, which has platformed new degrader classes capable of advancing the field towards the goal of degrading the entire human proteome. This review discusses ongoing strategies to identify degrons regulating native protein turnover, advances in chemical tools to activate these degrons, and new attempts to streamline degron pathways for simplified targeted protein degradation. The continued discovery and application of degrons has the power to transform human biology and combat disease.</dc:description>

         <title>Effects of clozapine on N&#8208;methyl&#8208;D&#8208;aspartate glutamate receptor&#8208;related amino acids in the rat medial prefrontal cortex</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clozapine is an excellent antipsychotic that has been widely used to treat conventional antipsychotic&#8208;refractory schizophrenia. Since a body of evidence indicates the involvement of the dysfunction of the N&#8208;methyl&#8208;D&#8208;aspartate type glutamate receptor (NMDAR) in the pathophysiology of antipsychotic&#8208;resistant and responsive symptoms of schizophrenia, we have explored the exact mechanisms underlying the superior clinical efficacy of clozapine by studying the effects of clozapine on brain extracellular signaling of NMDAR&#8208;related amino acids in the rat medial prefrontal cortex using an in vivo dialysis technique by a quantitative HPLC detection method. Intra&#8208;peritoneal injection of clozapine (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) failed to affect the prefrontal extracellular levels of D&#8208;serine, a coagonist for the NMDAR acting at the glycine site, and its precursor, L&#8208;serine, from 20 to 160&#8208;min post&#8208;injection The cortical extracellular concentrations of glycine, another NMDAR coagonist, and L&#8208;arginine, a nitric oxide/NMDAR pathway&#8208;associated factor, were significantly reduced by 10mg/kg of clozapine. Clozapine administration (20 mg/kg) nominally elevated the prefrontal extracellular levels of L&#8208;glutamate, which was not statistically significant after multiple comparisons. The present findings are consistent with the view that clozapine could influence the NMDAR function, at least in part, through modulation of the prefrontal cortical extracellular levels of glycine, L&#8208;arginine and glutamate.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Clozapine is an excellent antipsychotic that has been widely used to treat conventional antipsychotic-refractory schizophrenia. Since a body of evidence indicates the involvement of the dysfunction of the N-methyl-D-aspartate type glutamate receptor (NMDAR) in the pathophysiology of antipsychotic-resistant and responsive symptoms of schizophrenia, we have explored the exact mechanisms underlying the superior clinical efficacy of clozapine by studying the effects of clozapine on brain extracellular signaling of NMDAR-related amino acids in the rat medial prefrontal cortex using an in vivo dialysis technique by a quantitative HPLC detection method. Intra-peritoneal injection of clozapine (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) failed to affect the prefrontal extracellular levels of D-serine, a coagonist for the NMDAR acting at the glycine site, and its precursor, L-serine, from 20 to 160-min post-injection The cortical extracellular concentrations of glycine, another NMDAR coagonist, and L-arginine, a nitric oxide/NMDAR pathway-associated factor, were significantly reduced by 10mg/kg of clozapine. Clozapine administration (20 mg/kg) nominally elevated the prefrontal extracellular levels of L-glutamate, which was not statistically significant after multiple comparisons. The present findings are consistent with the view that clozapine could influence the NMDAR function, at least in part, through modulation of the prefrontal cortical extracellular levels of glycine, L-arginine and glutamate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploiting SpyTag/SpyCatcher Technology to Design New Artificial Catalytic Copper Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing artificial metal sites in proteins is challenging due to the need to place the metal site in precise positions and to tailor the coordination environment of the metal. A modular approach based on the SpyTag/SpyCatcher technology is used to provide the Spy construct with a Cu2+/ATCUN site. This strategy enables versatile metalloprotein design by shifting complexity from a protein to a peptide.

Designing artificial metal binding sites within a protein is challenging since amino acid residues need to be placed in desired positions in the final construct and the use of non&#8208;natural amino acids is difficult. The alternative approach of directing the insertion of artificial metal coordination systems presents the difficulty of grafting such site in a single desired position. Spy protein is composed of a protein component (SpyCatcher) which binds spontaneously an oligopeptide (SpyTag) with formation of an isopeptide bond. A SpyTag peptide equipped with an ATCUN (amino terminal copper and nickel) binding site is designed to bind copper(II) with high femtomolar affinity both in the absence of SpyCatcher and in the reconstituted Spy construct. The Cu2+ ATCUN site in the reconstituted Spy protein presents a catalytic activity in reactive oxygen species production, higher than that of the SpyTag peptide alone. This method offers a novel approach for constructing artificial metalloproteins by incorporating functional metal binding sites into a peptide, which can then be clicked onto its protein counterpart. The small size and modularity of this construct make it versatile for integration into other protein systems, eventually moving the complexity from a protein to a peptide and highlighting its potential for protein design.

         <title>Challenges and Achievements of Peptide Synthesis in Aqueous and Micellar Media</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide synthesis either on solid support or in solution for the potential development of new peptide drugs is facing a new challenge consisting in the progressive elimination of toxic polar aprotic solvents in favor of the more environmentally friendly water. The present review underlines challenges, opportunities, and achievements in this emerging field of research.

Peptides are being increasingly explored for drug development as well as other applications, ranging from research tools to food additives. This growing interest in peptides has led to the need to develop new sustainable synthetic approaches for this class of molecules. The present review article focuses on the synthesis of peptides in aqueous media to drastically reduce organic solvent use and its consequent environmental impact. After some pioneering investigations about solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis in water, the field is experiencing a renaissance also for the synthesis in solution spurred by increasing applications enabled by micellar catalysis. In this contribution, the challenges and opportunities offered by using aqueous and micellar media in the chemical synthesis of peptides are critically discussed.

         <title>Chemically Synthesized Fluorescence&#8208;Based Kinase Sensing Systems for Signaling in Cancer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents recent advances in chemically synthesized fluorescence&#8208;based kinase sensing systems, classified by kinase recognition types&#8212;specific peptide substrates, adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate, and inhibitor&#8208;based&#8212;and integrated with diverse fluorescent signaling moieties, including organic dyes, lanthanides, and nanomaterials. It highlights their design, mechanisms, and cancer&#8208;related applications, spanning in&#8201;vitro assays, live cell imaging, and in&#8201;vivo monitoring for diagnostics and therapeutic insights.

Kinases are an essential class of enzymes that regulate cellular processes through phosphorylation, influencing signal transduction, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. Dysregulation of kinase activity is a hallmark of cancer, contributing to tumorigenesis, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. Therefore, precise detection and monitoring of kinase activity are essential for understanding cancer biology and advancing diagnostics and therapeutics. Among various detection methods, fluorescence&#8208;based kinase sensing systems have emerged as highly sensitive, real&#8208;time tools for investigating kinase function. These systems leverage fluorescent moieties, either genetically encoded or chemically synthesized, to provide spatial and temporal insights into kinase activity in complex biological environments. This review focuses on chemically synthesized fluorescence&#8208;based kinase sensing systems, which offer unique advantages, including precise control over concentrations and compatibility with in&#8201;vitro and in&#8201;vivo applications. We have classified the chemically synthesized sensing systems into three categories: specific peptide substrate&#8208;based, adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate&#8208;recognition&#8208;based, and inhibitor&#8208;based sensing systems, each tailored to specific kinase activities. Compared to genetically encoded systems, chemically synthesized sensors demonstrate greater versatility and are better suited for quantitative high&#8208;throughput applications. This review explores the design, mechanisms, and applications of these systems in cancer biology, highlighting their potential for identifying kinase biomarkers, optimizing targeted therapies, and advancing personalized medicine.

         <title>Facile Conjugation Method of CpG&#8208;ODN Adjuvant to Intact Virions for Vaccine Development</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azide&#8208;enabled viral particles incorporating N&#8208;azidoacetyl glucosamine (GlcNAz) serve as 'clickable&#8217; platforms for conjugation with cyclo&#8208;octyne&#8208;modified CpG&#8208;ODN, enabling concurrent adjuvant&#8208;virion administration. The resulting complex enhances TLR9&#8208;mediated activation of bone marrow&#8208;derived macrophages more effectively than nonconjugated components. These conjugates increase immune cell stimulation, providing a versatile strategy to amplify immune responses in vaccine development.

Vaccines are a pivotal achievement in public health, offering inexpensive, distributable, and highly effective protection against infectious diseases. Despite significant advancements in vaccine development, there are still many diseases for which vaccines are unavailable or offer limited protection. The global impact of the deficiency in vaccine&#8208;induced immunity against these diseases is profound, leading to increased rates of illness, more frequent hospitalizations, and higher mortality rates. Recent studies have demonstrated conjugation mechanisms and delivery methods to copresent adjuvants and protein epitopes to antigen&#8208;presenting cells, significantly enhancing adaptive immunity A novel approach is introduced to incorporate an adjuvant into the vaccine by covalently attaching it to whole enveloped virions. Using &#8220;clickable&#8221; azide&#8208;enabled viral particles, generated through metabolic incorporation of N&#8208;azidoacetyl glucosamine (GlcNAz), the virions with a cyclo&#8208;octyne&#8208;modified CpG&#8208;ODN is conjugated. Conjugation yielded a potent adjuvant&#8208;virus complex, eliciting higher TLR9&#8208;mediated cell activation of cultured bone marrow&#8208;derived macrophages relative to coadministered adjuvants and virions. Administration of covalent adjuvant&#8208;virion conjugates increases immune cell stimulation and may provide a generalizable and effective strategy for eliciting a heightened immune response for vaccine development.

         <title>Covalent Peptide&#8208;Graphene Conjugates for Enhanced Cell Spreading, Osteogenic Differentiation, and Angiogenesis in Bone Defects</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three peptides RGD, DGEA, and KKGHK are covalently attached to the 2D nanomaterial graphene oxide (GO) to create new biomaterials for the treatment of severe bone injuries. These GO modifications improve cell spreading, stem cell differentiation into bone cell types, and formation of blood vessel&#8208;like structures. These results directly address common challenges faced by bone regeneration scaffolds.

Traumatic bone injury is one of the most common injuries that require surgical intervention, and current treatments suffer severe drawbacks. Modern research in bone regeneration focuses on implants that will support and enhance native tissue regeneration. One scaffold material that shows promise is graphene oxide (GO), a 2D nanomaterial made from oxidation of graphite. GO is biocompatible, strong, osteoinductive, is safely and slowly resorbed by the body, has a cheap, facile, and scalable synthesis, and is highly tailorable and functionalizable. The bioactivity of GO can be enhanced via functionalization with biomolecules such as peptides, proteins, and small molecules. Here, short peptides RGD, DGEA, and KKGHK are covalently bound to GO through a Claisen modification (CG) to create new functional graphenic materials that are cell&#8208;adhesive, osteogenic, and angiogenic, respectively. These peptide&#8208;Claisen graphenes (peptide&#8208;CGs) are found to be cytocompatible, to encourage cell spreading on the graphenic surface, to promote osteogenesis in stem cells, and to induce angiogenesis in vascular endothelial cells. They show promise as next&#8208;generation bone regeneration scaffolds by overcoming challenges frequently faced by bone regeneration scaffolds, namely retaining implanted and recruited cells, promoting their survival, proliferation, and differentiation, and ensuring a sufficient oxygen and nutrient supply to new tissue.

These peptide-Claisen graphenes (peptide-CGs) are found to be cytocompatible, to encourage cell spreading on the graphenic surface, to promote osteogenesis in stem cells, and to induce angiogenesis in vascular endothelial cells. They show promise as next-generation bone regeneration scaffolds by overcoming challenges frequently faced by bone regeneration scaffolds, namely retaining implanted and recruited cells, promoting their survival, proliferation, and differentiation, and ensuring a sufficient oxygen and nutrient supply to new tissue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;Substituted Adenosine Triphosphate Derivatives and their use in Enzymatic Synthesis and Postsynthetic Labelling of RNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 2&#8208;substituted adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;triphosphate derivatives is synthesized and tested as substrates for polymerases. In vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase, primer extension with engineered DNA polymerases, or 3&#8242;&#8208;labelling with poly(A) polymerase are used for enzymatic synthesis of base&#8208;modified RNA. Further postsynthetic reactions with 2&#8208;vinyl&#8208; or 2&#8208;ethynyladenosine are used to attach fluorescent labels.

A series of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) derivatives bearing chloro, fluoro, amino, methyl, vinyl, and ethynyl groups at position 2 are synthesized and tested as substrates for RNA and DNA polymerases. The modified nucleotides work well in in&#8201;vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase and primer extension (PEX) using engineered DNA polymerases (TGK, 2M) except for the bulkier 2&#8208;vinyl&#8208; and 2&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;ATP derivatives that give truncated products. However, in single nucleotide incorporation followed by PEX, they still can be used for site&#8208;specific incorporation of reactive modifications into RNA that can be further used for postsynthetic labeling through thiol&#8208;ene or Cu&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloadditions reactions. All modified ATPs work in polyadenylation catalyzed by poly(A) polymerase to form long 3&#8242;&#8208;polyA tails containing the modifications that also can be used for labeling.

         <title>Proline Amide Catalyzes Formation of Toxic Crotonaldehyde from Acetaldehyde Under Physiologically Relevant Conditions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crotonaldehyde&#8208;derived DNA lesions are reported in patients after ethanol exposure, which implies that crotonaldehyde is produced after ethanol ingestion. Here, we show that proline amide, which mimics N&#8208;terminal proline residues on human proteins, can catalyze crotonaldehyde formation from the ethanol metabolite acetaldehyde under physiologically relevant conditions. The work therefore provides a chemically plausible mechanism for crotonaldehyde formation in humans.

Crotonaldehyde is a human toxin that reacts with nucleophilic groups on DNA and proteins. Putative crotonaldehyde&#8208;derived adducts on DNA are reported in cells and patients after ethanol exposure, which implies that crotonaldehyde is formed in cells. Here, we show that proline amide, which is a model of N&#8208;terminal proline&#8208;containing proteins, catalyzes the aldol condensation of the ethanol metabolite acetaldehyde to crotonaldehyde under physiologically relevant conditions. This reaction is more efficient at neutral pH than under acidic or basic conditions, but is inhibited by competing imidazolidin&#8208;4&#8208;one formation. Crotonaldehyde formation is also slower than the analogous aldol condensation of propionaldehyde. Comparative studies additionally suggest that proline amide is a more efficient catalyst than other amino acid amides. Overall, the work evidences a biochemically plausible mechanism for intracellular crotonaldehyde formation and implies that proline amide derivatives can catalyze aldol chemistry in humans.

         <title>Development of Thiol&#8208;Labile &#945;&#8208;Amino Protecting Groups for Efficient Solid&#8208;Phase Peptide Synthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To develop thiol&#8208;labile &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;protecting groups for peptide synthesis, the nitrobenzenesulfenyl scaffold is systematically modified and the effects on chemical stability and thiol&#8208;mediated deprotection kinetics are evaluated. The findings reveal that introducing a C6 substituent and replacing the phenyl group with a pyridine ring significantly influence both stability and thiol susceptibility, offering valuable insights for optimizing protecting group design.

Recently, a thiol&#8208;labile &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;protecting group, 2,4&#8208;dinitro&#8208;6&#8208;phenyl&#8208;benzenesulfenyl (DNPBS), is introduced for solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). DNPBS&#8208;SPPS effectively mitigates major side reactions&#8212;such as aspartimide formation and &#945;&#8208;C racemization&#8212;that commonly occur in conventional Fmoc&#8208;SPPS. However, N&#8208;DNPBS&#8208;protected histidine is unstable during the base&#8208;catalyzed peptide bond coupling, leading to histidine redundant insertion byproducts (Nat. Commun. 2023, 14, 5324). In this study, modifications to the nitrobenzenesulfenyl protecting group are explored and their impact on chemical stability and thiol&#8208;mediated deprotection kinetics are systematically evaluated. It is found that introducing a C6 substituent and replacing the phenyl group with a pyridine ring significantly modulate both stability and thiol susceptibility. Notably, 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinesulfenyl (Npys) outperforms DNPBS in SPPS. N&#8208;Npys&#8208;protected histidine exhibits markedly greater stability than its N&#8208;DNPBS&#8208;protected counterpart, effectively preventing histidine redundant insertion byproducts commonly observed in DNPBS&#8208;SPPS. This study provides valuable insights into optimizing nitrobenzenesulfenyl&#8208;based protecting groups for more efficient SPPS.

         <title>Development and Recent Advances in SLIPT&#8208;PM: A Chemogenetic Platform for Manipulating Signaling at the Plasma Membrane</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upon cell stimulation, mammalian cells activate various signaling proteins and lipids by recruiting their upstream regulators to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (PM), which in turn determines their cellular response. Therefore,&#160;artificially inducing protein translocation to the PM is an effective strategy for dissecting cell signaling networks and engineering cellular functions. Self&#8208;localizing ligand&#8208;induced protein translocation (SLIPT) is an emerging technique that we developed to control protein localization in living cells using synthetic self&#8208;localizing ligands (SLs). Building on this strategy, we recently introduced a versatile chemogenetic SLIPT platform that rapidly recruits proteins of interest fused to an engineered&#160;Escherichia coli&#160;dihydrofolate reductase tag from the cytoplasm to the PM using a trimethoprim&#8208;based SL. The PM&#8208;specific SLIPT (SLIPT&#8208;PM) system is easy to use and enables researchers to manipulate diverse intracellular signaling molecules and pathways with controlled reversibility and repeatability. Owing to its modular design, related SLIPT&#8208;PM tools have also been developed to support more sophisticated experiments, such as light&#8208;induced spatially regulated protein recruitment and multiplexed signal manipulation. In this Concept article, we review the development, principal features, current applications, and future challenges of SLIPT&#8208;PM as a unique tool in chemical biology and synthetic biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Methods for Controlling Small GTPase Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small GTPases comprise a diverse class of signaling proteins in mammalian cells and regulate a variety of cellular processes such as cell growth, cell movement, vesicle formation, and nuclear transport. Due to their involvement in critical cellular pathways, changes in the activation state of small GTPases due to genetic mutations or alterations in gene expression can lead to human disease. As such, the ability to control the activity of small GTPases is paramount in understanding the precise role these proteins play in human biology and in reducing their impacts on related diseases. Herein, we present important advances made in the development of small molecule&#8208; and protein engineering&#8208;based strategies to control the activity of small GTPases. Current approaches within each area are discussed within their historical contexts along with commentary on the importance that each technology has had on improving our ability to regulate small GTPase activity. Given this ever&#8208;evolving toolbox for controlling small GTPase signaling, we anticipate continued growth in the study of this protein class.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Nucleoside Derivatives by Biomimetic Ester Migration</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modified nucleosides play important roles as agents in medicinal chemistry due to their anti&#8208;inflammatory, antiviral and anti&#8208;proliferative properties, as well as in biochemical processes like protein biosynthesis. Aminoacylated nucleosides in tRNA represent the central transfer unit of amino acids in the biosynthesis of peptides. Consequently, their synthesis in a prebiotic context is of great significance for further elucidations regarding the origin of life. To verify the formation of these structures in complex mixtures of regio&#8208; and stereoisomers, reference structures and their synthesis are of fundamental importance. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methodologies for the synthesis of monomeric tRNA nucleoside derivatives frequently result in the production of regioisomeric mixtures or encounter challenges related to isomerisation. In this context, we herein present a concise and comprehensive approach for the chemical synthesis of nucleosidic amino acid esters. The three&#8208;step reaction sequence exploits the phenomenon of 2&#8217;&#8208;3&#8217;&#8208;transaminoacylation in nucleosides providing the desired compounds in high yields. This biomimetic approach was further expanded to the activation of hydroxy groups by application of sulfonic acid esters. This has the potential to facilitate extensive modification via substitution or cross&#8208;coupling reactions, enabling the stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;controlled transformation of nucleosides into valuable target molecules or precursors in medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptidomimetics Targeting the Amyloidogenicity of Nucleophosmin 1 Mutations in Acute Myeloid Leukemia</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleophosmin 1(NPM1) is an abundant human protein endowed with many functions whose dysregulation leads to various cancers and mutations are relevant in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). In the wild type form, pentameric NPM1 resides mainly in the nucleolus even if it shuttles toward the cytosol exerting its chaperon function, conversely in AML&#8208;mutated versions it has mainly a cytoplasmic localization, hence the name NPMc+. All types of AML mutations determine an important amyloid aggregation propensity of the C&#8208;terminal domains (CTD) of NPMc+ and to exploit this amyloidogenicity for therapeutical purposes, herein we present the design, structural and functional investigations of a series of peptides analogues of the sequence of the 2nd helix of the three&#8208;helix bundle of the wt CTD, as potential enhancers of amyloid aggregation. Peptides were designed by introducing conservative mutations in the native 264&#8208;277 fragment and their structural features and amyloid propensities were assessed through ThT fluorescence, CD spectroscopies and SEM microscopy. Several &#8220;accelerator sequences&#8221; were employed in Amyloid Seeding Assays (ASAs): the sequence R1, with the single mutation Lys267/Arg, exhibited the greater ability to act as a promoter of the oligomerization of NPM1 264&#8208;277, limiting its toxicity and rescuing cell viability in OCI&#8208;AML3 cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescence Lifetime Multiplexing with Environment&#8208;Sensitive Chemigenetic Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorescence lifetimes of coumarin&#8208;pyridinium dyes are sensitive to the environment, with lifetimes decreasing as the polarity of the solvent increases. Herein, it is shown that this trend is preserved in the binding pockets of proteins, enabling multiplexed imaging of three targets in live cells with a single fluorophore, and informing the design of chemigenetic tools for fluorescence lifetime imaging.

HaloTag (HT) is a versatile self&#8208;labeling protein that has been widely adopted in fluorescence microscopy. Besides its established use as an intensity&#8208;based marker and sensor, interest in using HT for multiplexed fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) has recently arisen. Herein, the application of an environment&#8208;sensitive fluorophore was explored for FLIM multiplexing with the free dye and HT mutants. The extended coumarin pyridinium scaffold was selected due to its structural simplicity and the strong sensitivity of its photophysical properties to the environment. It was demonstrated that three&#8208;channel imaging is possible by taking advantage of the propensity of the dye to accumulate in mitochondria and vesicles and the efficient labeling of two distinct HT mutants. Further investigation was conducted on different dehalogenase proteins and their FLIM multiplexing capabilities when paired with an HT mutant. Finally, the polarity of the protein binding pocket was identified as a key feature that affects the lifetime of this kind of fluorescent molecule.

         <title>Changes in the Aqueous Solvent do not Impact the Internal Ring Flip Dynamic of Fully Buried F52 in Protein GB1</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic ring flips are a hallmark of protein dynamics. They are mediated by either transient &#8220;breathing&#8221; motions in which the protein expands into the solvent or by transient internal rearrangement of void spaces. Therefore, they are excellent reporters of such transient protein fluctuations. In order to decipher to what extend ring flip dynamics are governed by the protein itself or by the aqueous solvent around it, we study the ring flip of the fully buried aromatic side chain of F52 in protein GB1 with experimentally feasible altered buffer conditions by NMR relaxation dispersion experiments. We find that ring flip rate constants remain the same in all studied cases. Therefore, the ring flip dynamic in the interior of GB1 is independent from the solvent and only depends on the protein itself. In addition, this study shows that ring flips are comparable within different buffer conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Polyproline type II Peptidomimetic Disrupts a Grb2 SH3C Domain Protein&#8208;protein Interaction Implicated in Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the essential role of protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) in cellular signalling pathways their selective modulation is of great therapeutic interest. Mimicry of secondary structural protein elements has emerged as a promising strategy, with various scaffolds reproducing recognition surfaces of &#945;&#8208;helical and &#946;&#8208;strand/sheet proteins. A critical PPI, controlling cell growth and proliferation in breast and other cancers, occurs between Grb2 and a polyproline II (PPII) helix embedded in Gab2. Herein, we present the first example of a general approach for non&#8208;peptidic mimicry of extended PPII helices and demonstrate that the scaffold may be functionalised to recapitulate the binding characteristics of crucial hydrophobic and cationic Gab2 hot&#8208;spot side&#8208;chains. The rationally&#8208;designed peptidomimetic binds Grb2 at the same position as Gab2 (protein&#8208;observed NMR) with affinities comparable to the native peptide sequence (SPR). With the addition of a new polyproline II minimalist scaffold these studies further validate the use of diverse secondary structure peptidomimetics in disrupting therapeutically relevant PPIs.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Ene&#8208;Reductase Catalysis via EDA Complexes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flavin&#8208;dependent ene&#8208;reductases (EREDs) have emerged as powerful biocatalysts for the asymmetric reduction of various substrates. This review focuses on the recent advances in light&#8208;induced electron transfer&#8208;mediated reduction via EDA (electron donor&#8208;acceptor) complexes catalyzed by EREDs. Upon photoexcitation, the flavin cofactor transitions to an excited state, significantly enhancing its reduction potential. We discuss the mechanistic insights into how light activation alters the redox properties of EREDs, leading to more efficient catalysis. The review also highlights the broadened application scope of photoexcited EREDs in organic synthesis. Additionally, we explore the challenges and future directions in optimizing these light&#8208;driven biocatalytic processes.

This review focuses on the recent advances in light-induced electron transfer-mediated reduction via EDA (electron donor-acceptor) complexes catalyzed by EREDs. Upon photoexcitation, the flavin cofactor transitions to an excited state, significantly enhancing its reduction potential. We discuss the mechanistic insights into how light activation alters the redox properties of EREDs, leading to more efficient catalysis. The review also highlights the broadened application scope of photoexcited EREDs in organic synthesis. Additionally, we explore the challenges and future directions in optimizing these light-driven biocatalytic processes. This overview provides a foundation for the development of novel, light-controlled enzymatic systems with enhanced catalytic performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly is defined as a spontaneous ordering of molecules into distinct supramolecular structures similar to the naturally occurring biomolecules such as DNA, lipids and proteins. Interestingly, this strategy has gained huge importance in recent decades, leading to substantial advancements in the biomedical field, including drug delivery, biosensing, tissue engineering, etc. The unique role of &#8220;FF&#8221; moiety in promoting self&#8208;aggregation in larger proteins is well established owing to its frequent occurrence in amyloids. This finding came as a breakthrough in peptide nanotechnology research leading to the exploration of various peptide&#8208;based supramolecular structures demonstrating exceptional functional roles with futuristic applications. In this regard, since amino acids are the building blocks of peptides, the detailed investigation and discussion regarding their self&#8208;assembly behavior are expected to provide important insights into designing advanced functional materials from amino acids and peptides. This review provides a systematic overview of various latest findings on amino&#8208;acid&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly and its pathological as well as functional role. The review also highlights the importance of emerging applications from self&#8208;assembled amino&#8208;acid&#8208;based nanomaterials in the field of material science and biomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Molecules of Small Molecular and Peptidic HIV Fusion Inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hybrid molecules of small compounds (7&#8211;9) and peptide SC22EK (3) are designed as heterodimeric HIV fusion inhibitors (10&#8211;12) to compensate for the drawbacks of the homodimeric molecules of small compounds or peptides. Hybrid molecules (10a&#8211;c) have remarkably higher anti&#8208;HIV activity than SC22EK (3).

Since the membrane fusion step is the last chance to block the virus extracellularly, membrane fusion is an important target for anti&#8208;human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) agents. Previously, the dimeric derivatives of C34, which are contained in the HIV&#8208;1 envelope protein gp41 are found, linked by a disulfide bridge or a pegylated linker at its C&#8208;terminus have more potent anti&#8208;HIV activity than the C34 peptide monomer, and that bivalent inhibitors crosslinking two peptidomimetic small compounds have more potent anti&#8208;HIV activity than the parent small compounds. In the present study, the hybrids of small compounds (7&#8211;9) and peptides (SC34 (2) and SC22EK (3)) are designed as heterodimeric molecules (10&#8211;15) to compensate for the drawbacks of the above homodimeric molecules. Some hybrid molecules of small compounds (7&#8211;9) and peptide SC22EK (3) have remarkably higher anti&#8208;HIV activity than peptide SC22EK (3). Crosslinking small compounds and peptides (3) is found to be critical for an increase in anti&#8208;HIV activity. Hybrid molecules with small compounds and peptides are useful HIV&#8208;1 fusion inhibitors.

         <title>Visual Detection and Identification of Influenza A Viruses by Nucleic Acid Probe&#8208;Enabled Lateral Flow Assay</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a nucleic acid probe&#8208;enabled lateral flow assay (NALFA) for visual influenza A virus detection. The assay utilizes padlock probe&#8208;based target recognition, rolling circle amplification (RCA), and enzymatic cleavage to generate short amplicons, enabling gold nanoparticle&#8208;mediated lateral flow readout with attomolar sensitivity and high specificity. NALFA demonstrates 100% accuracy in clinical samples, highlighting its potential for convenient viral diagnosis.

Diagnosis of influenza A viral infection is crucial for preventing disease transmission and providing effective clinical treatments. There is an increasing need for convenient detection methods to enable simple yet precise identification of viral infections. Herein, a nucleic acid probe&#8208;enabled lateral flow assay (NALFA) is developed to realize visual detection and identification of influenza A viral infections (H1N1 and H3N2) of high sensitivity and specificity. Viral RNA targets are recognized by a padlock probe, which is circularized to induce rolling circle amplification (RCA). RCA products are enzymatically cleaved into short amplicons to complex with capture DNA probes for gold colloidal&#8208;induced visual lateral flow assay. NALFA achieved attomolar (aM) sensitivity for both standard viral RNAs, along with high specificity. While applying clinical samples (16 H1N1 patients, 12 healthy controls), NALFA exhibited high detection accuracy to successfully discriminate infected samples from noninfected samples. NALFA represents a potent and convenient nucleic acid detection assay that shall find its applications in fields of viral detection and beyond.

         <title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Monomeric and Tetrameric Amyloid &#946;1&#8208;42 Peptides with d&#8208;Aspartic Acid Residues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To investigate effects of stereoisomerization of aspartic acid residues in the amyloid &#946;1&#8208;42 peptide on aggregation, molecular dynamics simulations of monomers and tetramers using implicit and explicit solvent models are performed. Explicit solvent models are necessary to accurately model peptide&#8211;peptide interactions, and multimer simulations are essential for investigating structural characteristics in proteins containing d&#8208;amino acids.

Amyloid &#946;1&#8208;42 (A&#946;1&#8208;42) peptide includes three aspartic acid (Asp) residues. It is known that these Asp residues undergo stereoinversion to d&#8208;Asp in ageing tissues, a process that promotes &#946;&#8208;sheet structure formation. In this study, the 3D structures of A&#946;1&#8208;42 monomers and tetramers containing d&#8208;Asp residues are analyzed using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Seven types of mutants are generated by stereoinverting the three Asp residues, and monomer MD simulations are performed using an implicit solvent model for all seven mutants and the wild type. Following these implicit solvent simulations, tetramer MD simulations using explicit water molecules are conducted for the wild type and three mutants previously reported to form secondary structures in experimental studies. The MD simulations of A&#946;1&#8208;42 monomers with implicit solvent successfully reproduced the trend of increased &#946;&#8208;structure formation caused by D&#8208;Asp7 and d&#8208;Asp23. However, the effects of d&#8208;Asp1 are only captured in tetramer simulations using explicit water. These findings suggest that explicit water is necessary to accurately model peptide&#8211;peptide interactions and that multimer simulations are essential for investigating structural features, such as &#946;&#8208;sheet formations and aggregation in proteins containing d&#8208;amino acids.

         <title>PCFT Independent Cellular Uptake of Cyclic Cell Penetrating Peptide Conjugated Folic Acid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Folic acid is an essential component of many metabolic processes, including the synthesis of nucleoproteins, purines, and pyrimidines and is a recommended supplement to lower the incidence of various disorders. Folic acid and folate loaded nanoparticles are extensively evaluated for sustained release and enhanced stability of the molecule, however malfunctioning of Proton Coupled Folate Transporters (PCFT) present on the intestinal cells, and subsequent folate deficiency remain a major issue in this context. This study provides first demonstration where cell&#8208;penetrating peptide conjugated folic acid mediate PCFT independent folic acid permeabilization and intracellular bioavailability&#160;in vitro&#160;in the intestinal cells and macrophages. Cyclic&#8208;Transactivating transcriptional activator (cTAT) folic acid conjugates are prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis and are evaluated for the cellular uptake and bioavailability in the presence and absence of PCFT inhibitors. Compared with free folic acid that showed PCFT mediated cellular uptake, cTAT&#8208;folic acid conjugates exhibited enhanced cellular uptake at all studied pH and improved intracellular bioavailability of the cargo, as was determined by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) assay. Folic acid and cTAT&#8208;folic acid conjugates also dampened the production of pro&#8208;inflammatory mediators in the presence of toxins&#160;in vitro&#160;in macrophage cell lines.</dc:description>

         <title>NMR Pure Shift Spectroscopy and Its Potential Applications in the Pharmaceutical Industry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pure shift techniques significantly enhance the resolution of nuclear magnetic resonance spectra and show great potential for applications in the pharmaceutical industry. This article systematically reviews the main homonuclear broadband decoupling experiments and the methods for obtaining optimal pure shift spectra with the assistance of deep learning and analyzes their current research status in the pharmaceutical field.

1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy plays an important role in the pharmaceutical industry, but for complex substances, spectral analysis is challenging due to the narrow chemical shift range and signal splitting caused by scalar coupling. Pure shift techniques can suppress scalar coupling, improving spectral resolution. This article provides a review of pure shift techniques, including the main homonuclear broadband decoupling experiments and the methods for obtaining optimal pure shift spectra with the assistance of deep learning. Furthermore, it explores the potential application directions of pure shift techniques in the pharmaceutical industry, supported by relevant scientific examples.

         <title>Thermal Folding of Peptides into Single &#945;&#8208;Helical Turns</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The equilibrium between H&#8208;bond surrogate&#8208;constrained single &#945;&#8208;helical turn (S&#945;HT) and non&#8208;&#945;&#8208;helical turn gets biased towards S&#945;HT with increasing temperature. Steric constraints from the extent of C&#945;&#8208;substitution at i+1st and i+2nd residues of S&#945;HT, and solvent polarities, are good controls for improving fraction helicities from &#8776; 0.25 at 298 to &#8776; 0.92 at 353&#8201;K during such Thermal Folding.

Single &#945;&#8208;helical turns (S&#945;HT) are biorelevant peptide structures with potential applications in drug design. Augmented applications are envisioned for thermal folding (T&#8208;folding) S&#945;HT, wherein, a dynamic S&#945;HT in equilibrium with nonhelical conformers can be biased to favor S&#945;HT by increasing the temperature. Short peptides cannot fold into native S&#945;HT due to large conformational entropy. Covalent hydrogen bond surrogates (HBS) for the peptide H&#8208;bond have been designed to counter the entropy and enable such S&#945;HT folds. Here, HBS&#8208;constrained S&#945;HT are synthesized. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), CD spectral and computational analyzes reveal their existence in a S&#945;HT conformer which is in equilibrium with nonhelical conformers. Temperature&#8208;dependent spectral analyzes reveal their T&#8208;folding behavior, the extent of which can be controlled by varying the number of C&#945;&#8208;substituents at the i&#8201;+&#8201;1st and i&#8201;+&#8201;2nd residues and solvent polarities. The conformational transition of the minor nonhelical conformers to S&#945;HT with increasing temperature, is at the origin of T&#8208;folding. T&#8208;folding molecules can uniquely serve as therapeutics with thermally augmentable potencies.

         <title>Synthesis and evaluation of pseudoglucosinolates (psGSLs) releasing isothiocyanates (ITCs) in the presence of azoreductases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Naturally occurring isothiocyanates (ITCs) display multiple interesting bioactivities, but their medicinal exploitation is very limited as ITCs are non&#8208;druglike compounds with problematic pharmacokinetic properties. The concept of pseudoglucosinolates (psGSLs) provides a novel prodrug approach for the release of ITCs which can be adjusted to different triggers such as enzymatic and chemical microenvironments. Here, we report the first adaptation of this concept towards the release of ITCs in the presence of azoreductases within a turn&#8208;on fluorescence probe and underline its applicability in covalent protein labelling.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Organometallic Gold(III) Complexes as Precision Scaffolds for Next&#8208;Generation Therapeutic and Imaging Agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold(III) organometallic complexes, particularly cyclometalated Au(III) compounds, have emerged as powerful tools in catalysis and bioinorganic chemistry, offering unique reactivity distinct from their Au(I) counterparts. Among their most interesting transformations, C&#8211;S cross&#8208;coupling reactions have become a selective strategy for cysteine arylation, enabling site&#8208;specific modifications of peptides and proteins. This review provides a comprehensive overview of cyclometalated Au(III) complexes in C&#8211;S bond formation, detailing the mechanistic insights, ligand effects, and electronic factors that dictate their reactivity. The role of ancillary ligands in tuning stability and selectivity is critically assessed, alongside advancements in structural modifications that enhance catalytic efficiency. Beyond fundamental C&#8211;S cross&#8208;coupling, we explore the broader applications of these gold(III) complexes, including enzyme inhibition, metabolic disruption, and transmembrane protein modulation, with implications in anticancer therapy, antimicrobial strategies, and&#160;in vivo&#160;catalytic transformations. By bridging fundamental organometallic reactivity with innovative biomedical applications, this review highlights the potential of cyclometalated Au(III) complexes as next&#8208;generation catalysts for both synthetic and therapeutic innovations.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultraviolet Ozone Pretreatment Enhances selective PETase Biodegradation of Textiles Compared to Sunlight and Alkali Treatments.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid growth of the fashion industry has led to increasing textile waste, exacerbating environmental pollution and climate change. To support sustainability and circular economy goals, this study investigates the enzymatic degradation of cotton/polyethylene terephthalate (PET) mixed textiles using PETase, comparing wild&#8208;type (WT) and mutant (MUT S238F/W159H) variants.
To improve enzyme accessibility, we evaluated three pretreatment strategies: alkali treatment, ultraviolet&#8208;ozone (UVO) exposure, and natural sunlight weathering. The effects were assessed by measuring textile weight loss, surface morphology (SEM), infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and yields of terephthalic acid (TPA) and mono&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET).
Alkali treatment produced the highest weight loss, while UVO pretreatment moderately degraded textiles and significantly enhanced enzymatic TPA production. In contrast, prolonged sunlight exposure had negligible effects. ^1H NMR analysis of supernatants confirmed the formation of oxidized PET products following UVO exposure, indicating surface chemical modifications that increase enzymatic susceptibility.
Our results reveal differential effects on PET and cotton fibers, highlighting UVO as a promising, selective pretreatment for mixed textile waste. This study demonstrates the potential of combining photochemical oxidation and enzymatic processes for targeted PET degradation, contributing to more efficient textile recycling strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Glycoproteins, Glycolipids, or Both: Why do Glycosyltransferases Recognize Different Acceptors?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycosylation is an important post&#8208;translational modification catalyzed by glycosyltransferases (GTs), which comprise a large group of enzymes with diversified specificity. Most GTs show high specificity toward donor and acceptor molecules, but some can recognize several donor or acceptor molecules and/or create novel glycosidic linkage types. This promiscuity has profound implications for cellular processes, influencing signaling pathways, protein stability and disease progression. GT promiscuity may result from the structural peculiarities of the enzyme and acceptor, modulation by a ligand, oligomerization with other enzymes, or its subcellular localization. In this review, we discuss current insights into GT promiscuity, highlighting its biological significance and potential associations with human diseases. A better understanding of how GTs work will be essential for developing novel therapeutic approaches and obtaining enzymes with improved properties, which are desirable in the emerging field of glycobiotechnology.</dc:description>

         <title>Clade III Synthases Add Cyclic And Linear Terpenoids To The Psilocybe Metabolome</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Psilocybe &#8220;magic mushrooms&#8221;&#160;are best known for their indolethylamine psilocybin, yet they encode enzymes for a much more diverse arsenal of small and potentially bioactive molecules. Here, we report on four Psilocybe cubensis clade III sesquiterpene synthases, CubB&#8208;CubE, whose genes are differently expressed in fruiting bodies compared to vegetative mycelium. CubB&#8208;CubE were functionally characterized in vitro by product formation assays with heterologously produced enzymes and in vivo by transgene expression in Aspergillus niger, followed by extensive GC&#8208;MS analyses. CubB was identified as a single product (3R,6E)&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;nerolidol synthase. CubC is a multi&#8208;product enzyme producing &#946;&#8208;caryophyllene, &#946;&#8208;elemene, &#945;&#8208;humulene, and &#946;&#8208;farnesene. CubD and CubE catalyzed (near&#8208;)exclusively sterpurene formation. P. cubensis young fruiting bodies and vegetative mycelium were analyzed for sesquiterpenes which verified the presence of the CubB product &#945;&#8208;(3R,6E)&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;nerolidol. As various Psilocybe species encode highly similar enzymes, this study contributes generally to the as yet little understood secondary metabolome of the genus.</dc:description>

         <title>Hijacking the MDM2 E3 Ligase with novel BRD4&#8208;Targeting PROTACs in Pancreatic Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The phenotypic effect induced by a Proteolysis&#8208;Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) can depend on several factors, including the E3 ligase recruited. For the discovery of a first&#8208;in&#8208;class PROTAC for a target of interest, the E3 ligases commonly hijacked remain the Von Hippel&#8208;Lindau (VHL) and Cereblon (CRBN) since potent and accessible ligands are readily available to recruit them. Mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) E3 ligase stands out because it regulates p53 levels to maintain cellular homeostasis. However, the synthesis of the most potent MDM2 ligands remains very complex. Here we report the discovery of novel MDM2&#8208;recruiting PROTACs incorporating rac&#8208;Nutlin&#8208;3 as a ligand with an easier synthetic tractability, further demonstrating its potential in this technology. The most promising degrader, PROTAC 3, showed preferential degradation of the BRD4 short isoform and c&#8208;Myc compared with MZ1, a validated VHL&#8208;based PROTAC.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Thrombosis Initiation with Lasso Peptide Variants as Inhibitors to the von Willebrand Protein&#8211;Collagen Interaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wrangling the potential of natural product scaffolds: Lasso peptides, natural products of bacterial origin, have a unique interlocked [1]rotaxane peptide structure. The lasso peptide microcin J25&#160;can tolerate the substitution of several amino acids in the loop region to become tuned inhibitors that target protein&#8211;protein interactions, such as between von Willebrand factor and collagen, that initiate thrombosis.

Currently, there are no peptide&#8208;based therapeutics that safely target thrombosis initiation. Anticlot medications are mostly focused on platelet interactions, leading to side effects and complications. Herein, we utilize the unique [1]rotaxane architecture of&#160;lasso peptides as a scaffold for the development of new inhibitors to the protein&#8211;protein interaction between von Willebrand factor (vWF) and collagen, which is paramount to clot initiation. The microcin J25 lasso peptide tolerates the substitution of four contiguous amino acids within its loop, leading to two variants with LWEQ and FRSH sequences grafted within the loop. Each variant shows low micromolar activity in a fluorescently linked immunosorbent assay, an in vitro test for inhibition of the collagen&#8211;vWF interaction. In addition, the lasso peptides were treated with a panel of proteases and showed exceptional stability. These peptides launch a new class of potential antithrombosis agents and also help probe the connection between peptide structure and its inhibitory, drug&#8208;like characteristics.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Ephedrine is Initiated by Pyridoxal Phosphate&#8208;Dependent Formation of Cathinone</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ephedra alkaloids possess some of the most basic structures of alkaloids. Despite their importance for human use and their commercial relevance, the biosynthesis of ephedra alkaloids has remained enigmatic. The predominant biosynthetic pathway in the literature proposes a thiamine&#8208;dependent caboligation followed by a transaminase, although no candidate enzymes have yet been identified in ephedra alkaloid producers. In this work, an alternative pathway in plants to ephedra alkaloids via (S)&#8208;cathinone was investigated that circumvents the formation of 1&#8208;phenylpropane&#8208;1,2&#8208;dione as an intermediate and is in full agreement with previous biosynthetic studies. This alternative pathway involves the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)&#8208;dependent carboligation of benzoyl&#8208;CoA and l&#8208;alanine in a single step. The PLP&#8208;dependent formation of labeled and unlabeled (S)&#8208;cathinone was detected in plant lysate of young stem tissue of various Ephedra species that contained Ephedra alkaloids, as well as in young leaf tissue of Catha edulis. The incorporation of labeled nitrogen from l&#8208;alanine into (S)&#8208;cathinone supports the hypothesis that an &#945;&#8208;oxoamine synthase (AOS) catalyzes the formation of (S)&#8208;cathinone, bypassing the dione as an intermediate. These results demonstrate the involvement of a PLP&#8208;dependent AOS as a pivotal step in the biosynthesis of ephedra alkaloids.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding of Hg(I) and Hg(II) Ions to Amyloid&#8208;Beta (A&#946;) Peptide Variants Affect Their Structure and Aggregation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mercury (Hg) exposure is a possible risk factor for Alzheimer&#180;s disease (AD). Some studies reported higher Hg levels in AD patients, but evidence is inconclusive. A mechanism linking Hg exposure to AD neuropathology remains to be found. The hallmark of AD brains is deposits of insoluble amyloid plaques consisting mainly of aggregated amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides.
&#160;
Here, we use transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and biophysical spectroscopy techniques to study in vitro interactions between inorganic Hg and pathologically relevant A&#946;(1&#8208;40) and A&#946;(4&#8208;40) variants and the A&#946;(1&#8208;40)(H6A, H13A, H14A) mutant. For the first time, effect on A&#946; aggregation of both Hg(I) and Hg(II) is compared.
&#160;
Hg(II) binds A&#946;(1&#8208;40) with apparent binding affinity of 28&#177;8 &#181;M, at 20 &#176;C in 20 mM MES buffer, pH 7.3. The N&#8208;terminal His6, His13 and His14 residues are involved in binding coordination. Hg(II) binding induces structural alterations (coil&#8208;coil interactions) in A&#946; monomers positioned in membrane&#8208;mimicking SDS micelles. Equimolar amounts of either Hg(I) or Hg(II) inhibit normal A&#946; fibrillation by directing aggregation towards formation of large amorphous aggregates. All these structural rearrangements may be relevant for the harmful A&#946; aggregation processes involved in AD brain pathology. Inducing protein misfolding and aggregation might be a general toxic mechanism of mercury.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization of the Cubamyces Menziesii Terpenome</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The genome of Cubamyces menziesii reveals 18 putative sesquiterpene cyclase genes. These genes are cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, yielding 10 active enzymes. Using farnesyl diphosphate as substrate, the enzymes are analyzed, and the products characterized after bioconversion, uncovering diverse sesquiterpene structures. This study highlights the phylogenetic prediction and the ecological and biotechnological relevance of C. menziesii sesquiterpenes.

Long&#8208;lasting polypore fungi are significant producers of terpene cyclases of high interest for medicinal or biotechnological applications. Following the 1000 Fungal Genomes initiative launched by the Joint Genome Institute, the genome of Cubamyces (C.) menziesii and identified 18 genes encoding sesquiterpene cyclases (STCs) is explored. In a search for robust catalysts suitable for practical applications, the 18 codon&#8208;optimized open reading frames are cloned and overproduced the C. menziesii STCs in Escherichia coli. In ten cases, the catalytically active enzyme is purified and tested with three chemically synthesized linear diphosphates: geranyl diphosphate, farnesyl diphosphate (FDP), and geranylgeranyl diphosphate. Only FDP proved to be a substrate for these 10 enzymes. The product specificity of all these enzymes is determined by (GC&#8208;MS) gas chromatography mass spectrometry and (NMR) nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. Among the 10 enzymes, four produced a predominant compound, four yielded two main compounds, and the remaining two acted as a multiproduct catalysts. This work sheds light on the potential sesquiterpenes involved in the chemical ecology of the polypore C. menziesii and provides evidence for the potential of Polyporales fungi in the identification of new sesquiterpene cyclase activities.

This study highlights the phylogenetic prediction and the ecological and biotechnological relevance of &lt;i&gt;C. menziesii&lt;/i&gt; sesquiterpenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-lasting polypore fungi are significant producers of terpene cyclases of high interest for medicinal or biotechnological applications. Following the 1000 Fungal Genomes initiative launched by the Joint Genome Institute, the genome of &lt;i&gt;Cubamyces (C.) menziesii&lt;/i&gt; and identified 18 genes encoding sesquiterpene cyclases (STCs) is explored. In a search for robust catalysts suitable for practical applications, the 18 codon-optimized open reading frames are cloned and overproduced the &lt;i&gt;C. menziesii&lt;/i&gt; STCs in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;. In ten cases, the catalytically active enzyme is purified and tested with three chemically synthesized linear diphosphates: geranyl diphosphate, farnesyl diphosphate (FDP), and geranylgeranyl diphosphate. Only FDP proved to be a substrate for these 10 enzymes. The product specificity of all these enzymes is determined by (GC-MS) gas chromatography mass spectrometry and (NMR) nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. Among the 10 enzymes, four produced a predominant compound, four yielded two main compounds, and the remaining two acted as a multiproduct catalysts. This work sheds light on the potential sesquiterpenes involved in the chemical ecology of the polypore &lt;i&gt;C. menziesii&lt;/i&gt; and provides evidence for the potential of Polyporales fungi in the identification of new sesquiterpene cyclase activities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Stereoselective Total Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Galacto&#8208;Oligosaccharides Using Boron&#8208;Mediated Aglycon Delivery and Evaluation of their Immune&#8208;Enhancing Activities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the total synthesis of &#945;&#8208;galacto&#8208;oligosaccharides (&#945;&#8208;GOSs) 1&#8208;6 with different galactose chain lengths was achieved by the boron&#8208;mediated aglycon delivery , and their immune&#8208;enhancing activities in macrophage J774.1 cells. The results indicate that &#945;&#8208;GOS 2 exhibits the highest promotion of macrophage phagocytosis and increasing production of cytokines among &#945;&#8208;GOSs tested, which has the potential as a natural immunomodulatory agent.

&#945;&#8208;Galacto&#8208;oligosaccharides (&#945;&#8208;GOSs) are natural oligomeric saccharides found in plants that have garnered significant interest due to their indigestible nature and various biological activities. However, they often exist as inseparable mixtures, particularly long&#8208;chain substances. This study successfully achieves the total synthesis of &#945;&#8208;GOSs 1&#8208;6, featuring different lengths of galactose chains, using the boron&#8208;mediated aglycon delivery method developed in our laboratory. Additionally, this study investigates the immune&#8208;enhancing activity and structure&#8208;activity relationships of the chemically synthesized &#945;&#8208;GOSs. It reveals that the length of the galactose chain in the &#945;&#8208;GOSs significantly influences their immune&#8208;enhancing properties. Specifically, &#945;&#8208;GOS 2, which contains two galactose units, is found to markedly promote macrophage phagocytosis and increase the production of cytokines such as IL&#8208;6, TNF&#8208;&#945;, and IL&#8208;1&#946;. These results suggest that &#945;&#8208;GOS 2 could serve as a natural immunomodulatory agent in functional foods.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Cleavable Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptide&#8211;Cargo Conjugate via Low&#8208;Equivalent of Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptide Activated by 2,2&#8242;&#8208;Dithiodipyridine</title>

         <dc:description>
Serving as a sulfur exchange reagent, 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dithiodipyridine (DPDS) permits the use of low&#8208;equivalent cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) to produce CPP&#8211;cargo conjugates with a high conversion rate. Using this method, CPP&#8211;cargo conjugates are synthesized and ubiquitin (Ub) is effectively delivered into cells.

Cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) are favored for protein delivery due to their efficiency, rapidity, and low toxicity. However, conjugation of CPPs to proteins often requires significant amounts of CPPs to ensure yields, which also may result in increased protein dimer formation. Herein, it is reported that the use of low equivalents 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dithiodipyridine (DPDS)&#8208;activated CPP for conjugation cargo allows for high&#8208;conversion&#8208;rate CPP&#8211;cargo conjugates. Using this strategy, high&#8208;conversion&#8208;rate conjugates of cyclic deca&#8208;arginine peptide (cR10) with ubiquitin (Ub) and UbcH7 are obtained using only low equivalents of cR10. Furthermore, three CPPs are successfully conjugated to cargo via DPDS, and their successful cytosolic delivery is confirmed through fluorescence imaging.

         <title>Conformational Constraint for Prevention of Aging of Organophosphate&#8208;Inhibited Acetylcholinesterase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aging of organophosphate&#8208;inhibited acetylcholinesterase has been a barrier to treatments for toxicity from exposure. Unexpected results led &#160;to exploration of &#160;the use of allosteric effectors to regulate the inhibitor reaction pathway. In addition, an assay was developed to be used as a platform for screening for molecules that prevent or reverse aging.

The covalent inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by organophosphate compounds (OPCs) prevents the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, and results in overstimulation of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors leading to severe cholinergic crisis. To treat toxic exposure to OPCs, the focus has been on using reactivator compounds (e.g., oximes) to reverse the adduct formation in the enzyme's active site, and to release the regenerated, active form of AChE. However, the interaction between the OPC inhibitor and the enzyme is usually followed by a secondary dealkylative reaction in which the OPC &#8220;ages&#8221;, that is, produces an oxyanion on the phosphoryl group that cannot be recovered with standard reactivators. The unexpected discovey that immobilization of AChE prevented aging of OPC adducts led &#160;to the hypothesis that the inhibition and recovery pathways in AChE could be regulated by allosteric effectors that bind to the enzyme at a distance away from the site of inhibition. To demonstrate this, resistance to aging was replicated using bifunctional crosslinking of AChE in solution. This work provides the foundation to expand these principles to other potential effectors.

         <title>Exploring the Stability and Substrate Profile of Transaminase from Silicibacter pomeroyi with Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amine transaminases (ATAs), belonging to the class III transaminases within the superfamily of pyridoxal&#8208;5'&#8208;phosphate (PLP)&#8208;dependent enzymes, catalyze transamination reactions between amino donors and amino acceptors. These enzymes are particularly appealing for their role in the stereospecific synthesis of chiral amines. However, the stability of most ATAs is not satisfying, limiting their suitability for industrial applications. Among them, the amine transaminase from Silicibacter pomeroyi (Sp&#8208;ATA) has drawn attention due to its high activity and broad substrate scope under mild conditions and high pH. Nevertheless, maintaining the activity at higher temperatures presents a challenge. Previous research to enhance enzyme function through directed evolution has shown promise, yet predicting the cooperative effects of individual stabilizing mutations remains challenging. Computational approaches have been explored but often rely on structural information and are resource&#8208;intensive. An alternative strategy is ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR), which is based on gene sequences to create a more or less artificial phylogenetic tree. This study aims to leverage ASR techniques to explore the thermostability, solvent tolerance, and substrate profile of Sp&#8208;ATA, to find highly stable transaminases. By using Sp&#8208;ATA as a template and incorporating insights from ancestral sequences, this strategy offers a promising approach for developing robust biocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioactive Specialized Metabolites from Staphylococcus: Diversity, Biosynthesis, and Biotechnological Potential</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Staphylococci colonize diverse ecological niches and have evolved sophisticated survival strategies, like the production and secretion of a wide range of bioactive secondary metabolites. This review examines the biosynthesis, mechanism of action, and potential applications of these metabolites, with a particular focus on unusual biosynthetic pathways and emerging strategies to unlock the hidden metabolic potential of staphylococci.

Staphylococci are a heterogeneous group of bacteria capable of colonizing diverse ecological niches and adopting a wide variety of lifestyles. While several strains are known as notorious, multidrug&#8208;resistant human pathogens, others are harmless inhabitants of soil, water, and food products, or beneficial members of the skin microbiota. To survive and remain competitive under challenging environmental conditions, staphylococci have evolved the ability to assemble and secrete a diverse range of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides, nonribosomal peptides, terpenes, siderophores, and other specialized metabolites with antibiotic, immunomodulating and metal chelating activities. In this review, an overview of the bioactive metabolite arsenal of staphylococci is provided with a focus on their biosynthetic pathway, mode of action, and industrial application potential. Also, unexplored natural product biosynthetic pathways in staphylococci, along with strategies to access this hidden potential, are highlighted.

To survive and remain competitive under challenging environmental conditions, staphylococci have evolved the ability to assemble and secrete a diverse range of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides, nonribosomal peptides, terpenes, siderophores, and other specialized metabolites with antibiotic, immunomodulating and metal chelating activities. In this review, an overview of the bioactive metabolite arsenal of staphylococci is provided with a focus on their biosynthetic pathway, mode of action, and industrial application potential. Also, unexplored natural product biosynthetic pathways in staphylococci, along with strategies to access this hidden potential, are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bromine&#8208;Substituted Tricyanofuran&#8208;Based Fluorogenic Probes for the Sensitive Detection of Glycosidases under Acidic pH</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tricyanofuran&#8208;based fluorogenic probes are developed for the sensitive detection of lysosomal glycosidases in cancer cells. By introducing bromine to the ortho&#8208;position of phenolic alcohol, the fluorescence of the probe is enhanced over a wide pH range. These probes are used to effectively image glycosidase activities in live cells, and the results agree with those obtained from biochemical assays.

Glycosidases participate in modulating a number of biological processes, and their overexpression is a hallmark of several human diseases. Considering the localization of glycosidases predominantly in the lysosomes, it is imperative to develop molecular probes that are resistant to interference from acidic pH. Herein, tricyanofuran&#8208;based long&#8208;wavelength fluorogenic probes are synthesized, and it is demonstrated that the introduction of bromine to the ortho&#8208;position of the phenol alcohol of the probe substantially enhances its fluorescence over an acidic pH range of 3.0&#8211;10.0. These probes, when modified with glycosyl substrates, have proved applicable for the sensitive fluorogenic detection of glycosidases under acidic pH, and fluorescence&#8208;based imaging of endogenous &#946;&#8208;galactosidase and &#946;&#8208;glucosidase activities in live cells. The imaging results are validated by quantitative real&#8208;time polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting.

         <title>Chromenone derivatives as CRM1 Inhibitors for Targeting Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive and deadly cancers. Due to the complexity and redundancy within signaling networks in GBM, targeted inhibitors of specific pathways have shown only limited success. The nuclear export receptor Chromosome Region Maintenance 1 (CRM1) has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic target, as its inhibition can simultaneously disrupt multiple key oncogenic drivers. In this study, we explore whether chromenone derivatives, known for detecting thiol&#8208;containing molecules, can function as CRM1 inhibitors. We synthesized several chromenone&#8208;based derivatives and demonstrated that they inhibit CRM1&#8208;driven nuclear export in a structure&#8208; and dose&#8208;dependent manner. A preliminary structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) was established, providing a rationale for selective CRM1 binding based on molecular docking studies. Additionally, we showed that the active chromenone derivatives effectively inhibit the nuclear export of endogenous nuclear export signal (NES)&#8208;containing substrates in glioblastoma cells. Several of these compounds exhibit selective cytotoxicity against glioblastoma cell lines, highlighting their potential as targeted therapies for GBM.</dc:description>

         <title>A Ligase&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Step Approach for the Generation of Bicyclic Peptides Containing a Benzylphenyl Thioether Framework</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes a ligase&#8208;based two&#8208;step strategy for the construction of bicyclic peptides containing a benzyl phenyl thioether arm. The bicyclization reaction in this strategy can occur under low concentrations of tris&#8208;(bromomethyl)benzene, which shows little effect on the phage infectivity and will help maintain the diversity of phage displayed cyclic peptides.

This study describes a ligase&#8208;based two&#8208;step strategy to prepare a unique type of bicyclic peptide molecules containing a benzyl phenyl thioether arm. Different from the conventional bicyclic peptide construction method, this study first utilizes peptide ligases (SrtA or OaAEP1) to introduce an arylthiol group into the parent peptides and then performs bicyclization of the peptides by using TBMB to generate the desired bicyclic peptides. Since the pKa of aryl thiols is lower than that of alkyl thiols, the bicyclization reaction of the peptides in our system can occur under low concentrations of TBMB or low pH conditions. The low concentrations of TBMB have little effect on the phage infectivity, which will help maintain the diversity of phage&#8208;displayed cyclic peptides. This study establishes a biocompatible ligase&#8208;mediated two&#8208;step strategy for the preparation of bicyclic peptides, which has potential applications in the discovery of bioactive cyclic peptide ligands.

         <title>Cold&#8208;Adapted Lipid A from Polaribacter sp. SM1127: A Study of Structural Heterogeneity and Immunostimulatory Properties</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This analysis reveals structural heterogeneity in the lipopolysaccharide lipid A from the cold&#8208;adapted Gram&#8208;negative bacterium Polaribacter sp. SM1127, with variations in fatty acid chain number, length, branching, saturation, and hydroxylation degree, likely aiding bacterial adaptation to cold environmental stressors. Lipopolysaccharide is shown to be a weak activator of Toll&#8208;like receptor 4&#8208;mediated pathway, highlighting its potential as an immunomodulatory molecule.

Polaribacter sp. SM1127, a cold&#8208;adapted marine Gram&#8208;negative bacterium isolated from Laminaria in Arctic waters, plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling and biopolymer degradation in cold environments. Additionally, its exopolysaccharide (EPS) exhibits promising biotechnological potential, including antioxidant and wound&#8208;healing properties. This study focuses on the isolation and characterization of lipid A, the glycolipid component of Polaribacter sp. SM1127 lipopolysaccharide (LPS), by bypassing full LPS extraction and working directly with the ethanol precipitation product containing both EPS and bacterial cells. Mass spectrometry analysis reveals significant structural heterogeneity in the lipid A, with variations in fatty acid chain length, branching, saturation, and hydroxylation. These features likely enable the bacterium to fine&#8208;tune its response to fluctuating temperatures or other cold&#8208;related environmental stresses, contributing to resilience in the Arctic Ocean ecosystem. Furthermore, immunological assays demonstrate that both LPS and EPS produced by Polaribacter sp. SM1127 induce weak Toll&#8208;like receptor 4 activation and, in general, poorly stimulate the nuclear factor kappa&#8208;light&#8208;chain&#8208;enhancer of activated B cells pathway, compared to Escherichia coli LPS. These findings suggest their potential as immunomodulatory agents, like vaccine adjuvants.

         <title>SAAP&#8208;148 Oligomerizes into a Hexamer Forming a Hydrophobic Inner Core</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly cationic and hydrophobic antimicrobial peptide SAP&#8208;148 effectively eradicates multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria, persistent cells, and biofilms without inducing resistance. Its efficiency is likely due to its ability to disrupt bacterial membranes as an oligomer, forming a stable alpha&#8208;helical hexameric bundle with three parallel dimers that create a hydrophobic core.

Human cathelicidin LL&#8208;37 derivative, the 24&#8208;mer SAAP&#8208;148, is highly effective in&#8201;vitro in eradicating multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria without inducing resistance. SAAP&#8208;148 has a high cationic charge (+11) and 46% hydrophobicity, which, once the peptide folds into an alpha helix, forms a wide hydrophobic face. This highly amphipathic nature facilitates on the one hand its insertion into the membrane's fatty acyl chain region and on the other hand it&#180;s interaction with anionic membrane components, which aids in killing bacteria. However, the contributions of the secondary and quaternary structures have not been thoroughly investigated so far. To address this, we applied circular dichroism, NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray scattering, AlphaFold 3 protein folding software, and molecular dynamics simulations. Our results reveal that SAAP&#8208;148 adopts a stable hexameric bundle composed of three parallel dimers, that together form a hydrophobic core of aromatic side chain residues. The hexameric structure is retained at the membrane interface, whereby, MD simulation studies indicated the formation of a fiber&#8208;like structure in the presence of anionic membranes. This certainly seems plausible, as oligomers are stabilized by aromatic residues, and the exposure of positively charged side chains on the surface likely facilitates the transition of the peptide into fibrils on anionic membranes.

         <title>Optimization and Application of the Purified Cell&#8208;Free System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein synthesis using recombinant elements system has been broadly studied and optimized for its promising and practical application in several biotechnological research fields, including prototyping, non&#8208;canonical amino acid incorporation, and synthetic cell construction. Herein, the optimization progress and the cutting&#8208;edge application in recent years are summarized. Moreover, the future challenges and direction are discussed.

Cell&#8208;free protein synthesis (CFPS) is extensively applied in biotechnological research. Unlike the lysate&#8208;based CFPS system, the alternative purified cell&#8208;free system, protein synthesis using recombinant elements (PURE), has garnered a great attention due to its controllability and flexibility of adjusting individual component for in&#8201;vitro transcription and translation research. The PURE system has been widely studied in the synthetic biological field, and optimized for its application in prototyping research, non&#8208;canonical amino acid incorporation and synthetic cell construction. Herein, the recent optimization strategies for a simple and enhanced PURE system are discussed. In addition, the recent application via the PURE system and the current challenges for the development of a more robust and controllable PURE are highlighted.

         <title>Inhibition of Surfactin Biosynthesis in Bacillus Subtilis Using Cell&#8208;Permeable Adenylation Domain Inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
L&#8208;Leu&#8208;AMS&#8208;based adenylation domain inhibitors with the modification of 2&#8242;&#8208;OH in the adenosine skeleton are synthesized. Coupled with affinity&#8208;based protein profiling of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), their activities toward surfactin&#8208;NRPSs in Bacillus subtilis are evaluated. Finally, the ability of inhibiting the production of surfactin in the bacterial cells is confirmed.

Several natural bacterial virulence factors are biosynthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Therefore, NRPSs producing such natural products have emerged as attractive antibiotic targets. N&#8208;(aminoacyl)sulfamoyladenosine (aminoacyl&#8208;AMS) derivatives with chemical modifications at 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group of the adenosine skeleton are previously reported that inhibit NRPS amino acid adenylation (A) domains in recombinant enzyme systems, cellular lysates, and bacterial cells. The introduction of a couple of functionalities at the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group preserves the binding affinity toward NRPS amino acid A&#8208;domains and improves cell permeability of the AMS scaffold. However, the effects of these compounds on secondary metabolism have not yet been explored. In this study, an affinity&#8208;based protein profiling (AfBPP) probe, L&#8208;Leu&#8208;AMS&#8208;BPyne, is validated for in&#8208;cell applications, including imaging of NRPS activities in bacteria. Next, L&#8208;Leu&#8208;AMS derivatives incorporating methyl, benzyl, and cyanomethyl functionalities at the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group are synthesized and their inhibitory activity toward intracellular surfactin&#8208;NRPSs in the surfactin&#8208;producer Bacillus subtilis ATCC 21332 are investigated using the AfBPP probe. Finally, the attenuation of surfactin production using a Leu&#8208;AMS&#8208;BPyne probe and L&#8208;Leu&#8208;AMS derivatives in B. subtilis is demonstrated. These results indicate that chemical modifications at the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group provide a way to develop cell&#8208;permeable and functional NRPS A&#8208;domain inhibitors.

         <title>Lipid Metabolism and Immune Function: Chemical Tools for Insights into T&#8208;Cell Biology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores how lipids regulate immune responses, particularly in T&#8208;cell function. Advances in metabolomics and proteomics provide insights into lipid&#8208;mediated immunity. Fluorescent lipids enable single&#8208;cell analysis of lipid uptake and metabolism. Click chemistry offers a precise method to track lipid dynamics, overcoming traditional limitations and expanding therapeutic possibilities for immune&#8208;related diseases.

Lipids are essential biomolecules playing critical roles in cellular processes, including energy storage, membrane structure, and signaling. This review highlights the chemical tools that have been developed to study the role of lipid metabolism in immune function, focusing on T&#8208;cell biology. Fatty acids (FAs), as core lipid components, influence immune responses through structural, signaling, and metabolic roles. Recent studies reveal how specific FAs modulate T&#8208;cell activation, proliferation, and function, with implications for regulatory and effector subsets. Emerging tools, such as fluorescence&#8208;based lipids and click chemistry, enable precise tracking of lipid uptake and metabolism at the single&#8208;cell level, addressing limitations of traditional bulk methods. Advances in metabolomics and proteomics offer further insights into lipid&#8208;mediated immune regulation. Understanding these mechanisms provides opportunities to target lipid metabolism in therapeutic strategies for cancer and other immune&#8208;related diseases. The integration of lipidomic technologies into immunology uncovers novel perspectives on how lipids shape immune responses at cellular and molecular scales.

         <title>Phase Separation in Biological Systems: Implications for Disease Pathogenesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase separation in biological systems is discussed in various aspects including mechanisms involving various biomolecules, molecular complexes, and at cellular and organism level. Further, technologies to study phase separation, its implications in biological physiology, and diseases mechanisms and progression are discussions along with the potential targets and future therapeutics to probe and program phase separation in biological systems.

Phase separation is the phenomenon where distinct liquid phases, within solution, play a critical role in the organization and function of biomolecular condensates within cells. Dysregulation of phase separation has been implicated, which can be witnessed in various diseases including neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic syndromes, and cancer. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the role of phase separation in disease pathogenesis, which focuses on single amino acids, carbohydrates, and nucleotides. Molecular mechanisms underlying phase separation are also discussed with specific examples of diseases associated with dysregulated phase separation. Furthermore, consideration of therapeutic strategies targeting phase separation for disease intervention is explored.

         <title>Purine Chemistry in the Early RNA World at the Origins of Life: From RNA and Nucleobases Lesions to Current Key Metabolic Routes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the nascent processes of the beginnings and evolution of life, nucleobases and especially purines, ribonucleos(t)ides and primitive RNAs have been continuously modified. A RNA&#8208;peptide world and key metabolic pathways probably have emerged from the corresponding chemical modifications resulting from adenine deamination, purine alkylation and, acylation from amino acids, purine ring&#8208;opening reactions and rearrangements, RNA depurination and abasic site formation.

In early life, RNA probably played the central role and, in the corresponding RNA world, the main produced amino acids and small peptides had to react continuously with RNA, ribonucleos(t)ides and nucleobases, especially with purines. A RNA&#8208;peptide world and key metabolic pathways have emerged from the corresponding chemical modifications such as the translation process performed by the ribosome. Some interesting reactions of the purine bicycle and of the corresponding ribonucleos(t)ides are performed under plausible prebiotic conditions and described RNA chemical lesions are reviewed with the prospect to highlight their connection with some major steps of the purine and histidine biosynthetic pathways that are, in an intriguingly way, related through two key metabolites, adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate and the imidazole ribonucleotide 5&#8208;aminoimidazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxamide ribonucleotide. Ring&#8208;opening reactions of purines stand out as efficient accesses to imidazole ribonucleotides and to formamidopyrimidine (Fapy) ribonucleotides suggesting that biosynthetic pathway&#8217; first steps have emerged from RNA and ribonucleos(t)ide damages. Also, are summarized the works on the formation and catalytic properties, under plausible prebiotic conditions, of N6&#8208;derivatives of the purine base adenine as potential surrogates of histidine in catalysis accordingly to their structural relationship.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Postlabeling Reveals Nuclear Localization of a Highly Cytotoxic Half&#8208;Sandwich Ir(III) Tetrazine Complex in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the synthesis of five tetrazine&#8208;coordinated, half&#8208;sandwich iridium complexes and extensively describe their reactivity. Live cell fluorescent bioorthogonal labeling reveals the nuclear tropism of the most cytotoxic complex.

Intracellular imaging of anticancer metallodrugs often relies on prelabeling with organic fluorophores, which significantly affects their physicochemical properties and intracellular distribution. On the other hand, the reported postlabeling strategies based on click&#8208;chemistry reactions require cell fixation and permeabilization. Here, this study presents a postlabeling approach based on the catalyst&#8208;free, inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction (iEDDA) between a strained fluorescein&#8208;tagged bicyclononyne derivative (BCN&#8208;FAM) and half&#8208;sandwich Ir(III) complexes containing bidentate ligands comprising a tetrazine (Tz&#8208;R,R&#8217;) entity. Five half&#8208;sandwich Ir(III) complexes with formula [Cp*Ir(Tz&#8208;R,R&#8217;)Cl]0/+ have been synthesized and fully characterized, including the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of three of the five derivatives. Investigations of their stability and their reactivity in aqueous solution and in a model iEDDA reaction reveal the strong influence of the tetrazine ligand structure on the chemical properties of the corresponding complexes. A highly cytotoxic metallodrug candidate (Ir&#8208;C,NPh,Me) is identified from biological studies, and chemical reactivity studies disclose an unusual preference for binding of methionine over cysteine. Postlabeling of Ir&#8208;C,NPh,Me in live HeLa cells highlights its preferential accumulation within the nucleus, suggesting its retention through covalent modifications of nuclear proteins in good agreement with other half&#8208;sandwich iridium(III) complexes.

         <title>Leaf&#8208;Like Nanostructures Self&#8208;Assembled by Silver&#8208;Coordinated Photosensitizers as Collaborative Antimicrobial Agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research presents a novel approach to combat bacterial infections in wounds using self&#8208;assembled leaflike nanostructures. These structures, formed by coordination between the photosensitizers Cz&#8208;BTZ&#8208;mPy and silver ions, combine the antibacterial properties of silver with photoinduced singlet oxygen generation to enhance wound healing.

This research introduces an innovative approach to addressing bacterial infections in wounds using leaflike nanostructures, which are self&#8208;assembled via coordination between the photosensitizer phenylcarbazole&#8208;[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4&#8208;f]benzotriazole&#8208;m&#8208;pyridine and silver ions. These nanostructures combine photosensitizer&#8208;generated singlet oxygen with silver's antibacterial effects, synergistically promoting wound healing. When incorporated into a Carbopol 941 hydrogel matrix, these nanostructures achieve near&#8208;total bacterial eradication (0.04% survival) while accelerating wound healing and tissue regeneration in a mouse model. This dual&#8208;functional mechanism allows the nanostructures to perform exceptionally well against Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, even in biofilm environments, where conventional strategies solely on individual components often fail.

         <title>Identification of Endogenous Sequences Interacting with METTL3/METTL14 RNA Methyltransferase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Endogenous RNA sequences interacting with METTL3/METTL14 RNA methyltransferases (MTD3/14) are identified using RNA&#8208;capturing microsphere particles (R&#8208;CAMPs) that immobilize RNA fragments derived from the endogenous RNAs of human cells. Potential G&#8208;quadruplex sequences are isolated as binding targets and are preferentially methylated by MTD3/14, indicating a strong relationship between RNA modification and RNA G&#8208;quadruplex structure.

N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant RNA modification in mRNA and regulates various biological processes. The RNA&#8208;binding properties of m6A writer proteins play an important role in determining RNA modification sites. METTL3 and METTL14 form the core of the m6A writer complex, with METTL3 as the catalytic methyltransferase and METTL14 as the RNA&#8208;binding scaffold. Thus far, the comprehensive RNA&#8208;binding properties of METTL3/14 remain unknown. Using RNA&#8208;capturing microsphere particles (R&#8208;CAMPs), immobilizing RNA fragments derived from endogenous RNAs of human lung carcinoma cells, RNA fragments that interacted with the METTL3/14 methyltransferase domain are isolated. Bioinformatics analysis reveals that the pool of isolated sequences contains significantly more regions with the potential to form RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (rG4s) than the randomly extracted RNA sequence pool and that the (GGA) repeat sequences are most enriched. Circular dichroism spectroscopy, gel mobility shift assays, and methylation experiments demonstrate that METTL3/14 binds to RNA sequences containing (GGA) repeats that form rG4 structure much stronger than RNAs that do not form rG4s. This study shows the potential of RNA G&#8208;quadruplex structures as a modulator of epitranscriptomic modification of m6As.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Cholane&#8211;Phenanthrene&#8211;Cholane Trimers for Light&#8208;Harvesting Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of phosphodiester&#8208;linked cholane&#8211;phenanthrene&#8211;cholane trimers is described. The morphology of the formed nanostructures depends on the phenanthrene isomer used and on the cooling rate during the assembly process leading to nanosheets, worm&#8208;like structures, or nanotubes. Doping with pyrene results in a strong increase in the quantum yield, demonstrating the potential of these assemblies as artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems.

The self&#8208;assembly of two isomeric amphiphilic cholane&#8211;phenanthrene&#8211;cholane trimers and the light&#8208;harvesting properties of the formed supramolecular assemblies in aqueous medium are presented. Distinct differences in the supramolecular nanostructures are observed based on the type of phenanthrene isomer used, as well as on the cooling rate applied during the thermal self&#8208;assembly process. A fast cooling rate results in the formation of 2D objects (nanosheets) with both trimers. In contrast, a slow cooling process results in the observation of 3D objects, with worm&#8208;like nanostructures for the self&#8208;assembled 3,6&#8208;disubstituted phenanthrene trimer and nanotubes for the 2,7&#8208;isomer. Upon doping with an acceptor chromophore, the supramolecular phenanthrene assemblies demonstrate efficient energy transfer. The presence of small quantities (6%) of a pyrene acceptor results in a fivefold increase in the quantum yield compared to the phenanthrene trimer alone, highlighting their potential as artificial light&#8208;harvesting complexes. This work underscores the versatility of amphiphilic phenanthrene derivatives as building blocks for light&#8208;harvesting supramolecular systems.

         <title>Biochemical Characterization of Multimodular Xylanolytic Carbohydrate Esterases from the Marine Bacterium Flavimarina sp. Hel_I_48</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multimodular carbohydrate&#8208;active enzymes often combine different catalytic activities for efficient polysaccharide degradation. In this work, the structural and functional characterization of three multimodular xylan&#8208;targeting esterases, Fl6, Fll1 and Fll4 from Flavimarina sp. Hel_I_48, are presented. Each protein shows novelty in its architecture, with particular emphasis on the enzyme Fll4, which consists of three esterase domains, resulting in bifunctional esterase activity.

Carbohydrate&#8208;active enzymes (CAZymes) are critical for sustainable biomass utilization due to their ability to degrade complex polysaccharides. Frequently, a multimodularity can be observed combining several CAZyme domains and activities in close proximity which can benefit this degradation process. In this study, three multimodular xylanolytic carbohydrate esterases (CEs), named Fl6, Fll1, and Fll4, originating from Flavimarina sp. Hel_I_48 that represent a novel arrangement of catalytic and/or binding domains, are investigated. While Fl6 acts as a glucuronyl esterase, it also contains a carbohydrate binding module which is normally associated with xylanase activity. Fll1 combines xylosidase with acetylxylan esterase (AXE) activity mediated by a CE3 domain. The third enzyme, Fll4, is the first enzyme that comprises three distinct CE domains and shows bifunctional activity as an AXE and a feruloyl esterase (FAE). Investigation of the single domains reveals that the CE6 domain of Fll4 mediates its AXE activity while one of the putative CE1 domains, CE1a, mediates the FAE activity. This investigation of multimodularity of marine CAZymes not only enhances our understanding of these enzymes but may provide a promising route toward more efficient algal biomass utilization for biotechnological applications.

         <title>Avoiding Misreading during Genetic Reprogramming in mRNA Display</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
mRNA display is a powerful and increasingly accessible peptide discovery technology, but the in&#8201;vitro translation system it uses to create screening libraries is imperfect. This study examines the prevalence of errors during in&#8201;vitro translation and provides best practices for avoiding such errors to researchers who are designing mRNA display libraries.

mRNA display is a powerful and increasingly accessible peptide discovery technology. It takes advantage of a reconstituted in&#8201;vitro transcription and translation system to generate highly diverse affinity screening libraries. However, this process relies on the faithful translation of genetically encoded peptides, a conversion that is imperfect. Errors in translational decoding of mRNA can occur, decoupling the produced library from its genetic code. Because mRNA display affinity selections are analyzed with sequencing of the encoding DNA, rather than direct detection of the peptides, misreading silently reduces library diversity and complicates analysis. Herein, the presence of significant translational misreading during the production of mRNA display libraries is confirmed, best practices for genetic reprogramming are developed, and those rules are deployed to minimize the disconnect between genotype and phenotype in peptide affinity selections.

         <title>Engineering and Structural Elucidation of a Sac7d&#8208;Derived IgG Fc&#8208;Specific Affitin and Its Application for the Light&#8208;Controlled Affinity Purification of Antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An affitin derived from the Sac7d scaffold enables the light&#8208;controlled affinity purification of antibodies under physiological conditions, thus overcoming limitations of protein A chromatography. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and affinity measurements reveal complex formation with Fc at the CH2/CH3 junction, similar to protein A/G and FnRn. Combined with the light&#8208;responsive Azo&#8208;tag, this tiny adapter molecule opens new applications in antibody research.

While protein A affinity chromatography is widely established for antibody purification, the acidic elution conditions often lead to protein aggregation and deamidation. Here, an alternative approach is described for the purification of antibodies utilizing an engineered binding protein based on the archaebacterial Sac7d scaffold in combination with light&#8208;controlled &#945;&#8208;CD affinity chromatography (Excitography). Starting from a published affitin molecule, a monomeric protein version (C3A24) was engineered by substituting the unpaired thiol side chain Cys24 within the binding site by Ala, and, unexpectedly, its binding activity towards the human IgG1 Fc region was even improved (KD&#8201;=&#8201;76&#8201;nM). X&#8208;ray analysis of the cocrystallized C3A24 with a recombinant human Fc fragment revealed a 2:1 stoichiometry, with a binding site at the junction between the CH2 and CH3 domains. Interestingly, this binding site coincides with the ones of protein A, protein G, and the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). The affitin/Fc interaction is dominated by a network of hydrogen bonds, whereas, unpredicted by the initial affitin design, the two C&#8208;terminal Lys residues are also involved via a salt bridge and another hydrogen bond. Using the Azo&#8208;tagged C3A24, we purified clinically relevant antibodies from cell culture medium in a single step under physiological buffer conditions.

         <title>Mining Thermophile Genomes for New PETases with Exceptional Thermostabilities Using Sequence Similarity Networks</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeted genome mining identified thermostable enzymes (PETases) that hydrolyze the commonly used plastic polymer polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Thermostable enzymes are identified from thermophilic microbial sources. Experimental results reveal enzymatic activity on authentic PET films, highlighting potential for industrial application. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of one PETase is solved to understand its exceptional thermostability. These findings pave the way for engineering catalysts for a circular PET economy.

Enzymatic hydrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a promising technology for advancing a circular PET economy. Several PET&#8208;degrading &#945;/&#946; hydrolases have been identified, but the full potential of this enzyme family to catalyze PET hydrolysis remains largely unexplored. To address this, sequence similarity networks are employed to investigate the &#945;/&#946; hydrolase fold&#8208;5 subfamily (IPR029059) for new PETases. Priority is given to sequences from thermophiles, as thermostable enzymes are likely more suitable for industrial applications. Ten enzymes with &#8776;20% sequence identity to the well&#8208;known LCC&#8208;PETase are identified, and seven are successfully overexpressed and purified for in vitro characterization. Each enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of p&#8208;nitrophenyl butyrate, a mimic of trimeric PET, and emulsified PET nanoparticles. Notably, three enzymes are also capable of hydrolyzing PET films. Novel PETases exhibit melting temperatures (Tm) exceeding 55&#8201;&#176;C and only modest losses of activity after incubation at 70&#8201;&#176;C for 24&#8201;h. The crystal structure of AroC (Tm&#8201;=&#8201;85&#8201;&#176;C) is resolved to 2.2&#8201;&#197;, revealing several salt bridges that likely confer thermostability, and a unique loop that is conserved among the PETases described here. These novel enzymes will enable engineering campaigns to generate thermostable and catalytically efficient PETases for use as industrial biocatalysts.

         <title>Artificial Lipidation of Antifungal Proteins and Antifungal Behavior: A Case Study with Cholesterylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The antifungal behavior of artificial palmitoylated or cholesterylated chitinase domain is studied from biological, chemical, and physical properties, highlighting the importance of the chemical properties of the lipid moiety covalently attached to chitinase domain to obtain effective antifungal activity by artificial protein lipidation through a microbial transglutaminase&#8208;mediated reaction.

Lipid&#8208;based formulation of antifungal small drugs is used to mitigate drug toxicity while retaining effective antifungal activity. Herein, the effect of artificial cholesterylation of is studied, both of which were site&#8208;specifically modified using a microbial transglutaminase&#8208;reactive Q&#8208;tag (LysM&#8208;Q and CatD&#8208;Q). This produced protein&#8211;lipid conjugates (LysM&#8208;cholesteryl [Chol] or &#8208;palmitoyl [Pal] and CatD&#8208;Chol or &#8208;Pal). Although lipidation of these chitinase domains enhances the antifungal activity against Trichoderma viride, palmitoylated proteins (LysM&#8208;Pal and CatD&#8208;Pal) show stronger antifungal effects than cholesterylated proteins (LysM&#8208;Chol and CatD&#8208;Chol) both in the absence and presence of amphotericin B. Further characterization with lipidated LysM&#8208;fused green fluorescent protein (LysM&#8208;muGFP&#8208;Pal and &#8208;Chol) shows that the cholesterylation of proteins promotes distribution to dextran&#8208;rich phase in an aqueous two&#8208;phase system consisting of polyethylene glycol and dextran. Fluorescence microscopic analyses of the phase&#8208;separated giant unilamellar vesicles reveal a distinct anchoring behavior between LysM&#8208;muGFP&#8208;Pal and &#8208;Chol to lipid membranes, which is possibly correlated with aggregate formation. These results highlight that the chemical properties of the lipid moiety are crucial to achieve effective enhancement of antifungal activity through artificial lipidation.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Gapmer Oligonucleotides Containing 4&#8242;&#8208;Carboxy&#8208; and 4&#8242;&#8208;Carbamoyl&#8208;Thymidine Analogs</title>

Gapmer oligonucleotides (ONs) containing 4&#8242;&#8208;carboxy&#8208; and 4&#8242;&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;thymidine analogs in the gap region are synthesized and evaluated. Derivatization of the ONs is performed via postsynthetic modification. The synthesized ONs can form a stable duplex with target RNA regardless of 4&#8242;&#8208;substuents and elicit RNase H&#8208;mediated degradation of the RNA, and the RNA degradation rate is depending on the type of 4&#8242;&#8208;substuents.

Gapmer oligonucleotides (ONs) contain a gap region consisting of DNA, whose heteroduplex with RNA can be a substrate for RNase H. Herein, the synthesis and properties of gapmer ONs containing 4&#8242;&#8208;carboxy&#8208; and 4&#8242;&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;thymidine analogs at the gap region are reported. Synthesis of the ONs was performed by postsynthetic modification of 4&#8242;&#8208;(methoxycarbonyl)thymidine through hydrolysis and nucleophilic substitution. Concerning the synthesis of ONs containing 4&#8242;&#8208;(propylcarbamoyl)thymidine, postsynthetic conversion of 4&#8242;&#8208;carboxythymidine or 4&#8242;&#8208;(phenoxycarbonyl)thymidine on the support is effective. The duplex stabilities of the modified ONs are comparable to those of the unmodified ON. Several types of modified ONs can elicit the RNase H&#8208;mediated degradation of target RNA. Furthermore, modified ON containing 4&#8242;&#8208;carboxy&#8208;thymidine at the gap region shows improved stability in fetal bovine serum solution. The analogs used in this study can be modified nucleosides for the gap region of gapmer ONs.

         <title>Interdomain Coordination Determines Polyketide Extender Unit Specificity in UK&#8208;2A Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current understanding suggests that the specificity of extender unit incorporation is primarily regulated by acyltransferase domain, along with ketosynthase and thioesterase domains, In this work, it shows that the specificity extender unit incorporation is governed by interdomain coordination across the entire polyketide synthase module, rather than individual domains, offering new insights for the future engineering of polyketides.

Controlling the incorporation of extender units is a key strategy for manipulating polyketide scaffolds. Current understanding suggests that extender unit incorporation by modular polyketide synthase (PKS) is primarily regulated by acyltransferase domains, along with ketosynthase, ketoreductase, and thioesterase domains. In this study, the mechanism is investigated underlying the specific incorporation of the benzyl side chain at the C7 position of UK&#8208;2A, both in&#8201;vivo and in&#8201;vitro. These findings reveal that the incorporation of the benzylmalonyl&#8208;CoA extender unit is governed by interdomain coordination across the entire PKS module, rather than being controlled by individual domains. These results challenge previous recognition and offer new insights for the future engineering of polyketides.

         <title>Degradation of Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Megasynthetases SrfAA and SrfAB by Acyldepsipeptide&#8208;Activated ClpP in Bacillus Subtilis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
FtsZ is the only target protein that has been biochemically confirmed to be hydrolyzed both in&#8201;vitro and in bacterial cells. Coupled with activity&#8208;based protein profiling of nonribosomal peptide synthetases, the ClpP&#8208;ADEP1 proteolytic complex that degrades the surfactin synthetases SrfAA and SrfAB in cell lysates and bacterial cells is demonstrated.

Protein degradation is a tightly controlled biological process and is essential for maintaining bacterial proteostasis. ClpPs are a highly conserved family of serine proteases that interact with ATPases and play key roles in diverse cellular activities, including heat&#8208;shock response, expression of virulence factors, and protein turnover and homeostasis. Owing to their vital roles, drugs targeting ClpP&#8208;ATPases have attracted interest in treating bacterial infections. The mode of action of the antibiotic acyldepsipeptide (ADEP) is uncontrolled proteolysis by an ATPase&#8208;independent ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex. The cell division protein FtsZ is the only bacterial protein confirmed to be hydrolyzed by the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex in recombinant enzyme systems and cells. Here, the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex that causes degradation of the secondary metabolite nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) SrfAA and SrfAB in Bacillus subtilis is reported. Using in&#8201;vivo and in&#8201;vitro studies coupled with activity&#8208;based protein profiling of NRPSs, the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex that degrades SrfAA and SrfAB is demonstrated. Furthermore, the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex is reconstructed in cell lysates, confirming that SrfAA and SrfAB are sensitive to degradation by the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex. These findings demonstrate that SrfAA and SrfAB are protein substrates for the ClpP&#8208;ADEP complex, providing novel insights into the ClpP degradation machinery.

         <title>Design of Short Peptides for the Reduction of Silver Ions and Stabilization of Nanocomposites in Combating Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular design of amino acids, amphiphilic peptides, oligopeptides, and cationic antimicrobial peptides is crucial for reducing silver ions and stabilizing nanocomposites. The silver&#8208;peptide nanocomposites can be formed with and without the assistance of ultraviolet/sunlight but without any toxic reagents and plant extracts or microorganism, and they effectively inhibit bacterial strains by disrupting membranes and generating reactive oxygen species.

Combating bacterial infections has become a formidable challenge in healthcare due to the rise of antibiotic resistance. Recently, short peptide&#8208;based nanobiomaterials, assembled through silver metal and peptide building blocks, have emerged as promising antibiotic agents for treating resistant bacterial infections. In this minireview, recent advances in silver&#8208;peptide nanocomposites are highlighted, both with and without the assistance of UV or sunlight, for antibacterial applications. The chemical design of biomolecules such as amphiphilic short peptides, amino acids, and oligopeptides plays a crucial role in the reduction, stabilization, and biocompatibility of silver&#8208;peptide nanocomposites. Noncovalent interactions involved in the formation of nanocomposites are explored in the context of the structure&#8211;function relationship. The antibacterial activities and underlying mechanisms, which depend on specific peptide building blocks, are also reviewed. Finally, the conclusion and the outlook provide insights into the design of novel peptide building blocks for the development of silver&#8208;peptide nanocomposites with enhanced antibacterial activities.

         <title>Direct Preparation of Site&#8208;Specific Antibody&#8211;Drug Conjugates with Unpurified Antibodies in Culture Medium</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A K248 site&#8208;specific conjugation strategy enabling direct preparation of homogeneous antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) from unpurified cell culture media is established in this study. The method can be conducted under mild conditions with rapid completion, eliminating antibody pretreatment. It demonstrates broad compatibility with diverse payloads , , offering a streamlined, scalable solution for both laboratory and industrial ADCs&#160;production.

In comparison with traditional chemotherapeutic drugs, antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) have been extensively employed in cancer therapy due to their high selectivity and low systemic toxicity. However, the structural complexity of ADCs makes its preparation process more intricate and time&#8208;consuming. Conventional ADC production involves multistep purification processes, which significantly increase the costs. Herein, an approach for the direct preparation of site&#8208;specific ADCs in an antibody expression system that is derived from the reported K248 site&#8208;specific modification technology is demonstrated. This strategy requires only a single purification step to obtain site&#8208;specific ADCs, thereby greatly shortening the preparation cycle of ADCs. The preparation of site&#8208;specific ADCs in the expression system of Sacituzumab is successfully achieved. The resulting ADCs exhibited comparable physicochemical properties and activities to those obtained through the conventional two&#8208;step purification strategy. The approach demonstrates high compatibility with various linkers and antibodies, offering a streamlined&#160;methodology for the preparation of site&#8208;specific ADCs.

         <title>Valdiazen Derivatives for Chemoproteomic Studies in Burkholderia cenocepacia H111</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Valdiazen is a&#8201;quorum&#8208;sensing signal isolated from B. c. H111. Using diazeniumdiolate chemical probes, several valdiazen&#8208;binding proteins are identified, many of which are involved in structural and metabolic processes. This study offers valuable chemical tools and advances our understanding of the interactome associated with diazeniumdiolate signaling molecules.

Quorum sensing (QS) allows bacteria to coordinate community&#8208;wide behaviors such as biofilm formation, virulence, and symbiosis. The diazeniumdiolate valdiazen is identified in the opportunistic pathogen Burkholderia cenocepacia H111 as a novel quorum&#8208;sensing signal, yet its protein interactome remains unexplored. In this study, a chemoproteomic pulldown approach is used to identify potential valdiazen&#8208;binding proteins. For these pulldown experiments, a series of alkyne&#8208;linked and biotin&#8208;conjugated valdiazen probes are synthesized. Affinity&#8208;based pulldown experiments using biotin&#8208;valdiazen conjugates successfully identify several putative proteins including an ATP synthase subunit, a succinylglutamate desuccinylase/aspartoacylase, a granule&#8208;associated protein, an acetyl&#8208;CoA hydrolase, a serine protease and an OmpA/MotB precursor. Overall, this study provides insights into the valdiazen&#8211;protein interactome in Burkholderia cenocepacia H111, advancing our understanding of the role of valdiazen in bacterial QS.

         <title>A Bacterial Sulfotransferase Catalyzes an Unusual Di&#8208;Sulfation in Natural Products Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a unique sulfotransferase, AdpST, is identified from the adp biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) in Streptomyces davaonensis DSM101723 and demonstrates that AdpST possesses di&#8208;sulfation activity, which is unprecedented for bacterial phosphoadenosine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;phosphosulfate (PAPS)&#8208;dependent sulfotransferases. It is further shown that the adp BGC contains a dedicated PAPS biosynthetic cassette essential for improving sulfation capacity.

Sulfation is a widely used strategy in nature to modify the solubility, polarity, and biological activities of molecules. The enzymes catalyzing sulfation, sulfotransferases (STs), are typically highly specific to a single sulfation site in a molecule. Herein, the identification and characterization of sulfated adipostatins is reported and reveals a novel sulfotransferase, AdpST, which is responsible for di&#8208;sulfation at two sites of adipostatins. The initial bioinformatic analysis in search of adipostatin analogs from Streptomyces davaonensis DSM101723 identifies adpST and a 3&#8217;&#8208;phosphoadenosine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;phosphosulfate (PAPS) biosynthetic cassette, which are co&#8208;clustered with the adipostatin&#8208;encoding type III polyketide synthase. Mono&#8208; and di&#8208;sulfated adipostatin analogs are discovered in the extracts of S. davaonensis DSM101723, whereas di&#8208;sulfated bacterial natural products has not been reported. Using a series of in&#8201;vivo and in&#8201;vitro experiments, it is confirmed that AdpST is solely responsible for both mono&#8208; and di&#8208;sulfation of adipostatins, a catalytic activity which has not been identified in bacterial PAPS&#8208;dependent STs to date. It is further demonstrated that the dedicated PAPS biosynthetic cassette improves di&#8208;sulfation capacity. Lastly, it is determined that AdpST shares similarity with a small group of uncharacterized STs, suggesting the presence of additional unique bacterial STs in nature, and that AdpST is phylogenetically distant from many characterized STs.

         <title>Investigation of the Mechanism of Action of Natural and Synthetic Monoterpenoids: For a New Route in Antimycotic Molecules</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
4&#8208;Bromothymol shows a stunning in&#8201;vivo antimycotic efficacy, even on resistant molds and yeast. Discrete Fourier transform and molecular dynamics approaches reveal that 4&#8208;bromothymol has a high affinity toward the bilayer. Noteworthy, it forms a hydrogen bond with the oxygen of the phosphate in the lipid head, altering its structure and conceivably triggering a &#8220;domino effect&#8221; that affects the overall membrane stability.

Monoterpenoids are well&#8208;recognized natural antimycotic agents, but their mechanism of action is still unclear. Interestingly, synthetic derivatives, such as 4&#8208;bromothymol (4&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;isopropyl&#8208;5&#8208;methylphenol), are emerging as promising alternatives to natural molecules, due to their even greater biological activity. Herein, the antimycotic efficacy of 4&#8208;bromothymol is evaluated: in vivo experiments on species of acclaimed resistance demonstrate that 4&#8208;bromothymol has a minimum inhibitory concentration up to 6 times lower than thymol. In silico investigations, sweeping from partition coefficient (LogP) determination through density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations based on a minimum bias approach, support its improved antifungal activity with respect to thymol, carvacrol, and thymyl acetate. A structural insight of the mechanism of action is proposed. Even though all the analyzed compounds are able to penetrate the cellular membrane, 4&#8208;bromothymol shows a higher predicted affinity for the bilayer, and it causes a strong perturbation at the water/bilayer interface, altering the stability of the membrane, thus leading to cell death.

         <title>Designing Enzymatic Reactivity with an Expanded Palette</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovation in biocatalysis is rapidly increasingly the diversity of catalytic reactivity that can be mediated by enzymes, addressing a key bottleneck for their widespread adoption in industrial chemical synthesis. A key approach to this is building enzymes with unnatural catalytic components that provide an expanded palette with new possibilities for enzymatic reactivity.

The expanding applications of biocatalysis in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors herald a greener future for these industries. Yet, the range of chemical reactions known to enzymes only covers a small fraction of what is required for modern synthetic routes. To continue the increases in sustainability afforded by converting chemical processes into enzymatic ones, fundamentally new kinds of biocatalytic reactivity are required. Perhaps the very components from which enzymes are constructed, a palette of canonical amino acids and cofactors, inherently limit their catalytic possibilities, even if all the available natural sequence space can be explored. In recent years, there has been an explosion of strategies to produce new biocatalytic function through the incorporation of noncanonical amino acids and synthetic cofactors, new colors which are added to the enzyme design palette. This has enabled new enzymatic reactions that proceed via organocatalytic, organometallic, and photocatalytic mechanisms. Aside from designing new enzymatic activities from scratch, exogenous photocatalysts have recently also been used in synergy with natural enzyme active sites to diverge their reactivity towards radical pathways. This review will highlight recent developments in enriching enzymatic chemistry with new unnatural components, providing an outlook for future directions and needed developments for practicality and sustainability.
