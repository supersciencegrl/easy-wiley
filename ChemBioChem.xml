      <title>High&#8208;Resolution DNA Dual&#8208;rulers Reveal a New Intermediate State in Ribosomal Frameshifting</title>
      <dc:description>Ribosomal frameshifting is an important pathway used by many viruses for protein synthesis, which involves mRNA translocations of various numbers of nucleotides. Resolving the mRNA positions with sub&#8208;nucleotide precision will provide critical mechanistic information that is difficult to obtain with the current techniques. We report the method of high&#8208;resolution DNA rulers with sub&#8208;nucleotide precision and the discovery of new frameshifting intermediate states on the mRNA containing GA 7 G motif. Two intermediate states were observed with the aid of fusidic acid, one at the &#8220;0&#8221; reading frame and the other near the &#8220;&#8208;1&#8221; reading frame, in contrast to the &#8220;&#8208;2&#8221; and &#8220;&#8208;1&#8221; frameshifting products in the absence of the antibiotic. We termed the new near&#8208;&#8220;&#8208;1&#8221; intermediate as the Post(&#8208;1*) state, because it was shifted by approximately half a nucleotide compared to the normal &#8220;&#8208;1&#8221; reading frame at the 5&#8217;&#8208;end. This indicates a ribosome conformation that is different from the conventional model of three reading frames. Our work reveals uniquely precise mRNA motions and subtle conformational changes that will complement structural and fluorescence studies.</dc:description>

      <title>Subcellular localisation of a quinoline&#8208;containing fluorescent cyclometallated Ir(III) complex in Plasmodium falciparum</title>
      <dc:description>A fluorescent analogue of a previously synthesised  N,N  &#8208;chelated Ir(III) complex was prepared by the coordination of the organic ligand to an extrinsic bis(2&#8208;phenylpyridine)iridium(III) fluorophore. This cyclometallated Ir(III) complex in itself displays good, micromolar activity against the chloroquine&#8208;sensitive NF54 strain of  Plasmodium falciparum.  Live&#8208;cell confocal microscopy found negligible localisation of the fluorescent complex within the digestive vacuole of the parasite, eliminating the haem detoxification pathway as a potential mechanism of action. Similarly, no localisation of the complex within the parasitic nucleus was found, suggesting that this complex likely does not interfere with the DNA replication process. A substantial saturation of fluorescence from the complex was found near phospholipid structures such as the plasma and nuclear membranes but not in neutral lipid bodies. This indicates that an association with these membranes, or organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum or branched mitochondrion, could be essential to the efficacies of these types of antimalarial compounds.</dc:description>

      <title>Application of DNA&#8208;Alkylating Pyrrole&#8208;Imidazole Polyamides for Cancer Treatment</title>
      <dc:description>Pyrrole&#8211;imidazole (PI) polyamides, which target specific DNA sequences, have been studied as a class of DNA minor&#8208;groove binding molecules. To investigate the potential of the compounds for cancer treatment, PI polyamides were conjugated with DNA alkylating agents, such as seco&#8208;CBI and chlorambucil. DNA&#8208;alkylating PI polyamides have attracted attention because of their sequence&#8208;specific alkylating activities, which contribute to reducing the severe side effects of current DNA damaging drugs. Many of these types of conjugates have been developed as new candidates for anticancer drugs.

      <title>Activation, Structure, Biosynthesis and Bioactivity of Glidobactin&#8208;like Proteasome Inhibitors from Photorhabdus laumondii</title>
      <dc:description>The glidobactin&#8208;like natural products (GLNPs) glidobactin A and cepafungin I have been reported to be potent proteasome inhibitors and are regarded as promising candidates for anti&#8208;cancer drug development. Their biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC)  plu1881&#8722;1877  is present in entomopathogenic  Photorhabdus laumondii  but silent under standard laboratory conditions. Here we show the largest subset of GLNPs, which are produced and identified after activation of the silent BGC in the native host and following heterologous expression of the BGC in  E. coli  , respectively. The chemical diversity results from a relaxed substrate specificity and flexible product release in the assembly line of GLNPs. Crystal structure analysis of the yeast proteasome in complex with new GLNPs suggests that the degree of unsaturation and the length of the aliphatic tail are critical for their bioactivity. The results in this study provide the basis to engineer the BGC for the generation of new GLNPs and to optimize these natural products resulting in potential drugs for cancer therapy.</dc:description>

      <title>Ligand binding to dynamically populated G&#8208;quadruplex DNA</title>
      <dc:description>Several small molecule ligands specifically bind and stabilize G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) nucleic acid structures, which are considered as promising therapeutic targets. G4s are polymorphic structures with varying stability and their formation is dynamic. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of ligand binding to dynamically populated human telomere G4 DNA, using the bisquinolinium based ligand Phen&#8208;DC3 and a combination of single&#8208;molecule FRET microscopy, ensemble FRET and CD spectroscopy. Different cations are used to tune G4 polymorphism and folding dynamics. We find that ligand binding occurs to pre&#8208;folded G4 structures and that Phen&#8208;DC3 also induces G4 folding from unfolded single&#8208;strands. Following ligand binding to dynamically populated G4s, the DNA undergoes pronounced conformational redistributions, which do not involve direct ligand&#8208;induced G4 conformational interconversion. In contrast, the redistribution is driven by ligand&#8208;induced G4 folding and trapping of dynamically populated short&#8208;lived conformational states. Thus, ligand&#8208;induced stabilization does not necessarily require initial presence of stably folded G4s.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Preparative reversed&#8208;phase HPLC is the established method for purification of peptides, but has significant limitations. We systematically investigated the use of high&#8208;performance reversed&#8208;phase flash chromatography (HPFC) to rapidly purify laboratory&#8208;scale quantities of crude, synthetic peptides and chemically modified insulins. We demonstrated these methods for a diverse set of peptides, including short, medium&#8208;length, and long peptides. Depending on the purity profile of the peptide, HPFC can be used either as the sole purification method, or as a pre&#8208;purification method prior to a final HPLC purification. Furthermore, HPFC is suitable for purification of peptides that are not fully in solution. We provide guidelines for the HPFC of synthetic peptides and small proteins, including choice of columns, eluents, and gradients.

      <title>SP3&#8208;FAIMS chemoproteomics for high coverage profiling of the human cysteinome</title>
      <dc:description>Chemoproteomics has enabled the rapid and proteome&#8208;wide discovery of functional, redox&#8208;sensitive, and ligandable cysteine residues. Despite widespread adoption and considerable advances in both sample preparation workflows and MS instrumentation, chemoproteomics experiments still typically only identify a small fraction of all cysteines encoded by the human genome. Here, we develop an optimized sample preparation workflow that combines enhanced peptide labeling with single&#8208;pot, solid phase&#8208;enhanced sample&#8208;preparation (SP3) to improve the recovery of biotinylated peptides, including from small sample sizes. By combining this improved workflow with online high&#8208;field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) separation of labelled peptides, we achieve unprecedented coverage of &gt;14,000 unique cysteines in a single shot 70 min experiment. Showcasing the wide utility of the SP3&#8208;FAIMS chemoproteomic method, we find that it is also compatible with competitive small molecule screening by isotopic tandem orthogonal activity&#8208;based protein profiling (isoTOP&#8208;ABPP). In aggregate our analysis of 18 samples from 7 cell lines identified 34,225 total unique cysteines using only ~28 h of instrument time. The comprehensive spectral library and improved coverage provided by the SP3&#8208;FAIMS chemoproteomics method will provide the technical foundation for future studies aimed at deciphering the functions and druggability of the human cysteineome.</dc:description>

Showcasing the wide utility of the SP3&#8208;FAIMS chemoproteomic method, we find that it is also compatible with competitive small molecule screening by isotopic tandem orthogonal activity&#8208;based protein profiling (isoTOP&#8208;ABPP). In aggregate our analysis of 18 samples from 7 cell lines identified 34,225 total unique cysteines using only ~28 h of instrument time. The comprehensive spectral library and improved coverage provided by the SP3&#8208;FAIMS chemoproteomics method will provide the technical foundation for future studies aimed at deciphering the functions and druggability of the human cysteineome.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Co&#8208;occurring congeners reveal the position of enantiomeric amino acids in nonribosomal peptides</title>
      <dc:description>The C&#945; absolute configuration of the constituent amino acids in microbial nonribosomal peptides is typically determined using Marfey&#8217;s method after total hydrolysis of the peptide. A structural elucidation challenge arises when both D/L&#8208; enantiomeric configurations of an amino acid are encountered. Determining the actual position of each amino acid enantiomer within the peptide sequence typically requires laborious approaches based on peptide partial hydrolysis or even the total synthesis of the possible diastereomers. Herein, an alternative solution is discussed based on the homogeneous backbone chirality which governs all peptides biosynthesized by a common nonribosomal peptide synthetase. The information on configuration provided by Marfey&#8217;s analysis of co&#8208;occurring minor congeners can reveal unequivocally the stereochemical sequence of the whole peptide family</dc:description>

      <title>Isopenicillin N Synthase: Crystallographic Studies</title>
      <dc:description>Isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) is a nonheme iron oxidase (NHIO) which catalyses cyclisation of tripeptide &#948;&#8208;(  l  &#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminoadipoyl)&#8208;  l  &#8208;cysteinyl&#8208;  d  &#8208;valine (ACV) to bicyclic isopenicillin N (IPN). Over the last 25 years, crystallography has shed considerable light on the mechanism of IPNS catalysis.

      <title>Insight into mechanism of action and peptide&#8208;membrane interactions of Aib&#8208;rich peptides: multi&#8208;technique experimental and theoretical analysis</title>
      <dc:description>The increase in resistant bacterial strains necessitates the identification of new antimicrobial molecules. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are an attractive option because of evidence that bacteria cannot easily develop resistance to AMPs. The peptaibols, a class of naturally&#8208;occurring AMPs, have shown particular promise as antimicrobial drugs, but their development has been hindered because their mechanism of action is not clearly understood. To explore how peptaibols might interact with membranes, circular dichroism (CD), vibrational circular dichroism (VCD), linear dichroism (LD), Raman spectroscopy, Raman optical activity (ROA), neutron reflectivity and molecular dynamics simulations have been used to study a small library of peptaibol mimics, Aib&#8208;rich peptides. All studied peptides quickly partitioned and oriented in membranes,&#160; and we found evidence of chiral interactions between the phospholipids and membrane&#8208;embedded peptides. The protocols presented in this paper open new ground by showing how chiro&#8208;optical spectroscopies can throw light on the mechanism of action of AMPs.</dc:description>

      <title>Stepwise Post&#8208;glycosylation Modification of Sugar Moieties in Kanamycin Biosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Kanamycin A is the major 2&#8208;deoxystreptamine (2DOS)&#8208;containing aminoglycoside antibiotic produced by&#160;Streptomyces kanamyceticus. The 2DOS moiety is linked with 6&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;glucose (6ADG) at O&#8208;4 and 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;glucose at O&#8208;6. Because the 6ADG moiety is derived from&#160;d&#8208;glucosamine (GlcN), deamination at C&#8208;2 and introduction of C&#8208;6&#8208;NH2&#160;are required in the biosynthesis. A dehydrogenase KanQ and an aminotransferase KanB are presumed to be responsible for the introduction of C&#8208;6&#8208;NH2, although the substrates have not been identified. Here, we examined the substrate specificity of KanQ to better understand the biosynthetic pathway. It was found that KanQ oxidized kanamycin C more efficiently than the 3''&#8208;deamino derivative. Furthermore, substrate specificity of an oxygenase KanJ, which is responsible for deamination at C&#8208;2 of the GlcN moiety, was examined, and the crystal structure of KanJ was determined. It was found that C&#8208;6&#8208;NH2&#160;is important for&#160;substrate&#160;recognition by KanJ. Thus, the modification of the GlcN moiety occurs after pseudotrisaccharide formation, followed by the introduction of C&#8208;6&#8208;NH2&#160;by KanQ/KanB and deamination at C&#8208;2 by KanJ.</dc:description>

      <title>Discovery of an allosteric ligand binding site in SMYD3 lysine methyltransferase</title>
      <dc:description>SMYD3 is a multifunctional epigenetic enzyme with lysine methyl transferase activity and various interaction partners. It is implicated in the pathophysiology of cancers but with an unclear mechanism. To discover tool compounds for clarifying its biochemistry and potential as a therapeutic target, a set of drug&#8208;like compounds was screened using a biosensor&#8208;based competition assay. Diperodon was identified as an allosteric ligand. The (  R  )&#8208;and (  S  )&#8208;enantiomers of the racemic drug were isolated and their affinities determined (  K  D  &gt; = 42 and 84 &#956;M). Co&#8208;crystallization revealed that both enantiomers bind to a previously unidentified allosteric site in the C&#8208;terminal protein binding domain, consistent with its weak inhibitory effect. No competition between diperodon and HSP90 (a known SMYD3 interaction partner) was observed although HSP90&#8208;SMYD3 binding was confirmed (  K  D  = 13 &#956;M). The allosteric site appears to be druggable and suitable for exploration of non&#8208;catalytic SMYD3 functions and therapeutics with new mechanisms of action.</dc:description>

      <title>Peptide vectors carry pyrene to cell organelles allowing real&#8208;time quantification of free radicals in mitochondria by time&#8208;resolved fluorescence microscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Real time quantification of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS) in cells is of paramount importance as they are essential for cellular functions. Their excessive formation contributes to the dysfunction of cells and organisms ultimately leading to cell death. As ROS are mostly produced at the mitochondria, we have synthesized a fluorescent probe able to reach this organelle to detect and quantify, in real time, the variation of ROS by time&#8208;resolved microfluorimetry. The new probes are based on the long fluorescence lifetime of pyrene butyric acid (PBA). Two PBA isomers, attached at their 1&#8208; or 2&#8208; positions to a peptide vector to target mitochondria, were compared and were shown to allow the measurement of free radical species and oxygen, but not non&#8208;radical species such as H  2  O  2  .</dc:description>

As ROS are mostly produced at the mitochondria, we have synthesized a fluorescent probe able to reach this organelle to detect and quantify, in real time, the variation of ROS by time&#8208;resolved microfluorimetry. The new probes are based on the long fluorescence lifetime of pyrene butyric acid (PBA). Two PBA isomers, attached at their 1&#8208; or 2&#8208; positions to a peptide vector to target mitochondria, were compared and were shown to allow the measurement of free radical species and oxygen, but not non&#8208;radical species such as H  2  O  2  .&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>Site&#8208;specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids (uAAs) bearing a bioorthogonal group has enabled the attachment &#8211; typically at a single site or at a few sites per protein &#8211; of chemical groups at precise locations for protein and biomaterial labeling, conjugation, and functionalization.

We show that when expressed from multi&#8208;copy plasmids, the evolved aaRSs enable the production &#8211; using a genomically recoded  Escherichia coli  and the non&#8208;recoded BL21  E. coli  strain &#8211; of elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs) containing multiple pPR residues in high yields. We further show that the multi&#8208;site incorporation of pPR in ELPs facilitates the rapid, robust, and non&#8208;toxic fluorescent labeling of these proteins in bacteria. The evolved variants described in this work can be utilized to produce a variety of protein and biomaterial conjugates and to create efficient minimal tags for protein labeling.</dc:description>

      <title>Ferritin as a Platform for Creating Antiviral Mosaic Nanocages: Prospects for Treating COVID&#8208;19</title>
      <dc:description>
Tackling bottlenecks: Antibody&#8208;dependent enhancement of infection and low or narrow efficacy against strains of a virus are two bottlenecks to antibody therapy and vaccines. To tackle them, I propose using ferritin to develop novel antiviral mosaic nanocages that could deliver a cocktail of antibodies, nanobodies, or a combination of therapeutics, deceive a virus, or elicit a broad neutralizing antibody response.







Abstract
Infectious diseases are a continues threat to human health and the economy worldwide. The latest example is the global pandemic of COVID&#8208;19 caused by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Antibody therapy and vaccines are promising approaches to treat the disease; however, they have bottlenecks: they might have low efficacy or narrow breadth due to the continuous emergence of new strains of the virus or antibodies could cause antibody&#8208;dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. To address these bottlenecks, I propose the use of 24&#8208;meric ferritin for the synthesis of mosaic nanocages to deliver a cocktail of antibodies or nanobodies alone or in combination with another therapeutic, like a nucleotide analogue, to mimic the viral entry process and deceive the virus, or to develop mosaic vaccines. I argue that available data showing the effectiveness of ferritin&#8208;antibody conjugates in targeting specific cells and ferritin&#8208;haemagglutinin nanocages in developing influenza vaccines strongly support my proposals.

      <title>Cell&#8208;free synthesis of selenoproteins in high yield and purity for selective protein tagging</title>
      <dc:description>The selenol group of selenocysteine is much more nucleophilic than the thiol group of cysteine. Selenocysteine residues in proteins thus offer reactive points for rapid post&#8208;translational modification. Here we show that selenoproteins can be expressed in high yield and purity by cell&#8208;free protein synthesis by global substitution of cysteine by selenocysteine. Complete alkylation of solvent&#8208;exposed selenocysteine residues was achieved in 10 minutes with 4&#8208;chloro&#8208;methylene&#8208;dipicolinic acid (4Cl&#8208;MDPA) under conditions that left cysteine residues unchanged even after overnight incubation. Gd(III)&#8211;Gd(III) distances measured by double electron&#8211;electron resonance (DEER) experiments of maltose binding protein (MBP) containing two selenocysteine residues tagged with 4Cl&#8208;MDPA&#8208;Gd(III) were indistinguishable from Gd(III)&#8211;Gd(III) distances measured of MBP containing cysteine reacted with 4Br&#8208;MDPA tags.</dc:description>

      <title>Activity&#8208;based profiling of bile salt hydrolysis in the human gut microbiome with beta&#8208;lactam or acrylamide&#8208;based probes</title>
      <dc:description>Microbial bile salt hydrolases (BSHs) found in the intestine catalyze the deconjugation of taurine&#8208; and glycine&#8208;linked bile salts produced in the liver. The resulting bile salts are biological detergents and are critical in aiding lipophilic nutrient digestion. Thereby, the activity of BSHs in the gut microbiome is directly linked to human metabolism and overall health. Bile salt metabolism has also been associated with disease phenotypes such as liver and colorectal cancer. In order to reshape the gut microbiome to optimize bile salt metabolism, tools to characterize and quantify these processes must exist to enable a much&#8208;improved understanding of how metabolism goes awry in the face of disease, and how it can be improved through an altered lifestyle and environment. Furthermore, it is necessary to attribute metabolic activity to specific members and BSHs within the microbiome. To this end, we have developed activity&#8208;based probes with two different reactive groups to target bile salt hydrolases. These probes bind similarly to the authentic bile salt substrates, and we demonstrate enzyme labeling of active bile salt hydrolases using purified protein, cell lysates, and in human stool.</dc:description>

      <title>Remote Water&#8208;Mediated Proton Transfer Triggers Inter&#8208;Cu Electron Transfer: Nitrite Reduction Activation in Copper&#8208;Containing Nitrite Reductase</title>
      <dc:description>The copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductase (CuNiR) catalyzes the biological conversion of nitrite to nitric oxide, in which the key long&#8208;range electron/proton transfers are involved in the catalysis. However, the details of the electron/proton transfer mechanism are still unknown. In particular, the driving force of the electron transfer from the type&#8208;1 copper (T1Cu) site to the type&#8208;2 copper (T2Cu) site is ambiguous. Here, we explored the two possible proton transfer channels by using two&#8208;layered ONIOM calculations, including the high&#8208;pH proton channel and the primary proton channel. Our calculation results reveal that the driving force for electron transfer from T1Cu to T2Cu comes from a remote water&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;proton transfer, which can be termed as a water&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer mechanism. In the high&#8208;pH proton channel, the water&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;proton transfer occurs from Glu113 to an intermediate water molecule, whereas in the primary channel the transfer is performed from Lys128 to His260. Subsequently, the two channels employ another two or three distinct proton transfer steps to deliver the proton to the nitrite substrate at the T2Cu site. These findings explain the detailed proton/electron transfer mechanisms of copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductase and may extend our understanding of the diverse proton&#8208;coupled ET mechanisms in complicated proteins.</dc:description>

      <title>Targeting the surface of the protein 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 by ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (1.5 nm), carrying the specific peptide CRaf</title>
      <dc:description>The surface of ultrasmall gold nanoparticles with an average diameter of 1.55 nm was conjugated with a 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 protein&#8208;binding peptide derived from CRaf. Each particle carries 18 CRaf peptides, leading to an overall stoichiometry of Au  &#187; 115  (CRaf)  18  . The binding to the protein 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 was probed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and fluorescence polarization spectroscopy (FP). The dissociation constant (  K  D  ) was measured as 5.0 &#181;M by ITC and 0.9 &#181;M by FP, which was close to the affinity of dissolved CRaf to 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 s . In contrast to dissolved CRaf which alone did not enter HeLa cells, CRAF&#8208;conjugated gold nanoparticles were well taken up by HeLa cells, opening the opportunity to target the protein inside a cell.</dc:description>

      <title>Efficient assay for the detection of hydrogen peroxide via estimation of the enzyme promiscuous activity in the perhydrolysis reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrogen peroxide is an ideal oxidant in the view of availability, atom&#8208;economy, or green aspects. Furthermore, it is produced by the cell mitochondria and plays a meaningful role in controlling the physiological processes, but unregulated production leads to the destruction of organs. Due to its diverse roles, a fast and selective method for hydrogen peroxide detection is the major limitation to prevent the negative effects caused by its excess. Therefore, we aimed to develop an efficient assay for the detection of H2O2. For this purpose, we combined the enzymatic method for the detection of hydrogen peroxide via the estimation of the promiscuity of various enzymes. We estimated the activity of an enzyme in the reaction of p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters with hydrogen peroxide resulting in the peracid formation. According to our knowledge, there is no example of a simple, multi&#8208;sensor demonstrating the promiscuous activity of an enzyme and detecting the hydrogen peroxide in the aqueous media.</dc:description>

Due to its diverse roles, a fast and selective method for hydrogen peroxide detection is the major limitation to prevent the negative effects caused by its excess. Therefore, we aimed to develop an efficient assay for the detection of H2O2. For this purpose, we combined the enzymatic method for the detection of hydrogen peroxide via the estimation of the promiscuity of various enzymes. We estimated the activity of an enzyme in the reaction of p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters with hydrogen peroxide resulting in the peracid formation. According to our knowledge, there is no example of a simple, multi&#8208;sensor demonstrating the promiscuous activity of an enzyme and detecting the hydrogen peroxide in the aqueous media.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Antimicrobial and Anticancer Properties of Synthetic Peptides Derived from the Wasp Parachartergus fraternus</title>
      <dc:description>Agelaia&#8208;MPI and protonectin are antimicrobial peptides isolated from the wasp  Parachartergus fraternus  that show antimicrobial and neuroactive activities. Previously, two analogues of these peptides, neuroVAL and protonectin&#8208;F were designed to reduce nonspecific toxicity and improve potency. Here, the three&#8208;dimensional structures of neuroVAL, protonectin and protonectin&#8208;F were determined using circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy. Antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic and hemolytic activities were tested for the parent peptides and analogues. All peptides showed moderate antimicrobial activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, with agelaia&#8208;MPI being the most active. Protonectin and protonectin&#8208;F were found to be toxic to cancerous and non&#8208;cancerous cell lines. Internalization experiments revealed that these peptides accumulate inside both cell types. By contrast, neuroVAL was nontoxic to all tested cells and was able to enter cells without accumulating. In summary, neuroVAL has potential as a non&#8208;toxic cell penetrating peptide, while protonectin&#8208;F needs further modification to realize its potential as an antitumor peptide.</dc:description>

      <title>Biosynthetic Intermediate Probes for Visualizing and Identifying the Biosynthetic Enzymes of Plant Metabolites</title>
      <dc:description>
See what&#8216;s missing: Biosynthetic study of plant metabolites paves the way for manufacturing plant&#8208;derived drugs by synthetic biology. However, identifying any missing enzymes in a plant metabolic pathway is a formidable challenge. Biosynthetic intermediate probes make potentially useful tools to resolve the challenge by visualizing biosynthetic enzymes to facilitate transcriptome analysis or chemical proteomics approaches for identifying the biosynthetic enzymes.







Abstract
Plant metabolites play important roles in both plant physiology and drug discovery. Taking advantage of new emerging technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS), whole genome assembly, bioinformatics, omics&#8208;based strategies have been demonstrated as popular and powerful ways to elucidate complex metabolic pathways in plants. In this viewpoint, biosynthetic intermediates probes have been proposed as the potentinal tools to study the plant natural product biosynthesis via chemical proteomics appoaches or transcriptome analysis.

      <title>Chemical Translational Biology: Redefining Druggability of Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Protein&#8208;protein interactions are challenging targets for drug discovery. The field of chemical translational biology has made advances in making these once &#8220;undruggable&#8221; targets more amenable to ligand discovery and design. The development of peptide therapeutics and the discovery of adaptive and allosteric ligands show particular promise for difficult interactions.







Abstract
Chemical biologists use chemical tools to answer biological questions. The translational application of these principles has led to an explosion in the discovery and druggability of new protein targets, including protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs). Proteins tend to interact with other macromolecules using relatively large and featureless binding surfaces, which has hampered traditional drug discovery efforts, particularly for interactions with weaker affinity. In this article, I discuss several emerging strategies for targeting PPIs, including computational and structural methods and novel screening approaches. In particular, I focus on hijacking intrinsic protein allosteric pathways for the discovery and design of small&#8208;molecule and peptide ligands.

      <title>Genetic Incorporation of Selenotyrosine Significantly Improves Enzymatic Activity of Agrobacterium radiobacter Phosphotriesterase</title>
      <dc:description>Tyrosine plays important roles in many enzyme catalysts. To facilitate enzyme design, mechanistic studies and minimize structural perturbation in the active site, here we report the genetic incorporation of a novel unnatural amino acid selenotyrosine (SeHF), which has single atom replacement in comparison to tyrosine. The  Agrobacterium radiobacter  phosphotriesterase (  ar  PTE) Tyr309SeHF mutant exhibits a significant 12&#8208;fold increase in  k  cat  and 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in  k  cat  /  K  m  at pH 7.0.  Molecular dynamics simulation  shows that the SeHF309 mutation results in a conformational switch which opens up the product release pocket and increases the product release rate, thereby elevating the overall enzyme activity. Significant improvement of the catalytic efficiency at neutral pH by single unnatural amino acid (UAA) mutation broadens the application of this enzyme, and provides valuable insights to the mechanism. Our method represents a new approach for designing enzymes with enhanced activities.</dc:description>
