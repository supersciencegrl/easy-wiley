      <title>Photoswitchable Lipids</title>
      <dc:description>Photoswitchable lipids are emerging tools for the precise manipulation and study of lipid function. They can modulate many aspects of membrane biophysics, including permeability, fluidity, lipid mobility and domain formation. They are also very useful in lipid physiology and enable optical control of a wide array of lipid receptors, such as ion channels, G protein&#8208;coupled receptors, Nuclear Hormone Receptors, and enzymes that translocate to membranes. Enzymes involved in lipid metabolism often process them in a light&#8208;dependent fashion. Photoswitchable lipids complement other functionalized lipids widely used in lipid chemical biology, including isotope labeled lipids (lipidomics), fluorescent lipids (imaging), bifunctional lipids (lipid&#8208;protein crosslinking), photocaged lipids (photopharmacology), and other labeled variants.</dc:description>

      <title>Effect of Regiochemistry and Methylation on the Anticancer Activity of a Ferrocene&#8208;Containing Organometallic Nucleoside Analogue</title>
      <dc:description>
Iron works: A ferrocene derivative, one of a series of ferronucleosides designed by the Tucker group, shows micromolar toxicity in a range of cancer cell lines. Their latest research shows the importance to activity of having arms in adjacent positions, with the 1,1&#8217;&#8208;regioisomer much less active in bone cancer cell lines. On the other hand, N&#8208; or O&#8208;methylation has much less of an effect; this rules out a conventional mechanism of action for a nucleoside, giving further weight to one that involves the iron centre. More information can be found in the full paper by N.&#8197;J. Hodges, J.&#8197;H.&#8197;R. Tucker et&#8197;al.

     alt="Effect of Regiochemistry and Methylation on the Anticancer Activity of a Ferrocene&#8208;Containing Organometallic Nucleoside Analogue"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Iron works&lt;/b&gt;: A ferrocene derivative, one of a series of ferronucleosides designed by the Tucker group, shows micromolar toxicity in a range of cancer cell lines. Their latest research shows the importance to activity of having arms in adjacent positions, with the 1,1&#8217;&#8208;regioisomer much less active in bone cancer cell lines. On the other hand, N&#8208; or O&#8208;methylation has much less of an effect; this rules out a conventional mechanism of action for a nucleoside, giving further weight to one that involves the iron centre. More information can be found in the &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/cbic.202000124full paper by N.&#8197;J. Hodges, J.&#8197;H.&#8197;R. Tucker et&#8197;al.&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>Flavin&#8208;Dependent Monooxygenases NotI and NotI&#8242; Mediate Spiro&#8208;Oxindole Formation in Biosynthesis of the Notoamides</title>
      <dc:description>
The notoamides are a fascinating class of anticancer natural products where two phylogenetically related fungal strains have evolved to generate enantiomeric (mirror image) terminal products. A study of the enzymes (NotI/NotI&#8242;) responsible for spirocycle formation revealed their differential flexibility in accepting the opposite substrate and catalyzing formation of the respective spiro&#8208;oxindole product. The preferential conversion of (&#8722;)&#8208;stephacidin&#8197;A by both enzymes suggests an evolutionary divergence from a common ancestor that was selective for (+)&#8208;notoamide B/A production.

      <title>Using Mutability Landscapes to Guide Enzyme Thermostabilization</title>
      <dc:description>The thermostabilization of enzymes while retaining their activity and enantioselectivity for applied biocatalysis is an important topic in protein engineering. Rational and computational design strategies as well as directed evolution have been used successfully to thermostabilize enzymes. Here, we describe an alternative mutability&#8208;landscape approach that identified three single mutations (R11Y, R11I and A33D) within the enzyme 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT), which has potential as a biocatalyst for pharmaceutical synthesis, that gave rise to significant increases in apparent melting temperature  T  m  (up to 20 &#176;C) and in half&#8208;life at 80 &#176;C (up to 111&#8208;fold). Introduction of these beneficial mutations in an enantioselective but thermolabile 4&#8208;OT variant (M45Y/F50A) afforded improved triple&#8208;mutant enzyme variants showing an up to 39 &#176;C increase in  T  m  value, with no reduction in catalytic activity or enantioselectivity.

      <title>Selective Covalent Targeting of Anti&#8208;Apoptotic BFL&#8208;1 by a Sulfonium Tethered Peptide</title>
      <dc:description>Anti&#8208;apoptotic B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL&#8208;2) family proteins were proven targets for human cancers. Targeting the BH3&#8208;binding pockets of these anti&#8208;apoptotic proteins could reactivate apoptosis in BCL&#8208;2&#8208;depedent cancers. BFL&#8208;1 is a BCL&#8208;2 family protein overexpressed in various chemoresistant cancers. A unique cysteine at the binding interface of the BH3 and BFL&#8208;1 was previously proven as an intriguing targeting site to irreversibly inhibit BFL&#8208;1 functions with stabilized cyclic peptide bearing a covalent warhead. Recently, we developed a sulfonium tethered peptide cyclization strategy to construct peptide ligands which could selectively and efficiently react with cysteine(s) of target proteins nearby the interacting interface. Utilizing this method, we constructed a BFL&#8208;1 peptide inhibitor B4&#8208;MC, which could selectively conjugate with BFL&#8208;1 both in vitro and in cell. B4&#8208;MC showed good cellular uptake, colocalized with BFL&#8208;1 on mitochondria, and showed obvious growth inhibition of BFL&#8208;1 over&#8208;expressed cancer cell lines.</dc:description>

      <title>Genetic Incorporation of Selenotyrosine Significantly Improves Enzymatic Activity of Agrobacterium radiobacter Phosphotriesterase</title>
      <dc:description>Tyrosine plays important roles in many enzyme catalysts. To facilitate enzyme design, mechanistic studies and minimize structural perturbation in the active site, here we report the genetic incorporation of a novel unnatural amino acid selenotyrosine (SeHF), which has single atom replacement in comparison to tyrosine. The  Agrobacterium radiobacter  phosphotriesterase (  ar  PTE) Tyr309SeHF mutant exhibits a significant 12&#8208;fold increase in  k  cat  and 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in  k  cat  /  K  m  at pH 7.0.  Molecular dynamics simulation  shows that the SeHF309 mutation results in a conformational switch which opens up the product release pocket and increases the product release rate, thereby elevating the overall enzyme activity. Significant improvement of the catalytic efficiency at neutral pH by single unnatural amino acid (UAA) mutation broadens the application of this enzyme, and provides valuable insights to the mechanism. Our method represents a new approach for designing enzymes with enhanced activities.</dc:description>

      <title>Epigenetic Chemical Biology: Opportunities Beyond the Advances and Opportunities in Epigenetic Chemical Biology</title>
      <dc:description>The study of epigenetics has greatly benefited from the development and application of various chemical biology approaches. In this review, we highlight the key targets for modulation and recent methods developed to enact such modulation. We discuss various chemical biology techniques to study DNA methylation and posttranslational modification of histones and their effect on gene expression. Additionally, we address the wealth of protein synthesis approaches to yield histones and nucleosomes bearing epigenetic modifications. Throughout we highlight targets which present opportunities for the chemical biology community, as well as exciting new approaches which will provide additional insight into the roles of epigenetic marks.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The study of epigenetics has greatly benefited from the development and application of various chemical biology approaches. In this review, we highlight the key targets for modulation and recent methods developed to enact such modulation. We discuss various chemical biology techniques to study DNA methylation and posttranslational modification of histones and their effect on gene expression. Additionally, we address the wealth of protein synthesis approaches to yield histones and nucleosomes bearing epigenetic modifications. Throughout we highlight targets which present opportunities for the chemical biology community, as well as exciting new approaches which will provide additional insight into the roles of epigenetic marks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Insights into protein stability in cell lysate by 19F NMR spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>In living organisms, protein folding and function take place in an inhomogeneous, highly crowded environment possessing a concentration of diverse macromolecules of up to 400&#160;g/L. It has been shown that the intracellular environment has a pronounced effect on the stability, dynamics and function of the protein under study and has for this reason to be considered. However, most protein studies are neglecting the presence of these macromolecules. Consequently, we probe here the overall thermodynamic stability of cold shock protein B from&#160;  Bacillus subtilis  &#160;(  Bs  CspB) in cell lysate. We found that an increase in cell lysate concentration causes a monotonic increase in thermodynamic stability of&#160;  Bs  CspB. This result strongly underlines the importance of considering the biological environment when inherent protein parameters shall be quantitatively determined. Moreover, we demonstrate that the targeted application of&#160;  19  F NMR spectroscopy operates as an ideal tool utilized to protein studies performed in complex cellular surroundings.</dc:description>

      <title>Prebiotic origin of pre&#8208;RNA building blocks in a urea &#8220;warm little pond&#8221; scenario.</title>
      <dc:description>Urea appears to be a key intermediate of important prebiotic synthetic pathways. Concentrated pools of urea likely existed on the surface of the early Earth, as urea is synthesized in significant quantities from hydrogen cyanide or cyanamide (widely accepted prebiotic molecules), it has extremely high water solubility, and it can concentrate to form eutectics from aqueous solutions. The dual nucleophilic&#8208;electrophilic character of urea makes it an ideal precursor for the formation of nitrogenous bases. We propose a model for the origin of a variety of canonical and non&#8208;canonical nucleobases, including some known to form supramolecular assemblies that contain Watson&#8208;Crick&#8208;like base pairs. These reactions involve urea condensation with other prebiotic molecules (e.g., malonic acid) that could be driven by environmental cycles (e.g., freezing/thawing, drying/wetting). The resulting heterocycle assemblies are compatible with the formation of nucleosides and, possibly, the chemical evolution of molecular precursors to RNA. We show that urea eutectics at moderate temperature represent a robust prebiotic source of nitrogenous heterocycles. The simplicity of these pathways, and their independence from specific or rare geological events, support the idea of urea being of fundamental importance to the prebiotic chemistry that gave rise to life on Earth.</dc:description>

      <title>Simple analysis of primary and secondary bile salt hydrolysis in mouse and human gut microbiome samples using fluorogenic substrates</title>
      <dc:description>Animals produce bile to maximize absorption of lipophilic nutrients in the gut. The physical properties of bile are largely dictated by amphipathic bile salt molecules, which also participate in signalling pathways by modulating physiological processes upon binding host receptors. Upon excretion of bile salts from the gall bladder into the intestine, the gut microbiome can create metabolites with modified signaling capabilities. The category and magnitude of bile salt metabolism can have positive or negative effects on the host. A key modification is bile salt hydrolysis, which is a prerequisite for all additional microbial transformations. We have synthesized five different fluorogenic bile salts for simple and continuous reporting of hydrolysis in both murine and human fecal samples. Our data demonstrate that most gut microbiomes have the highest capacity for hydrolysis of host&#8208;produced primary bile salts, but some microbially modified secondary bile salts also display significant turnover.</dc:description>

      <title>NIR&#8208;absorbing Ru(II) Complexes Containing &#945;&#8208;Oligothiophenes for Applications in Photodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>The design of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;active photosensitizers (PSs) for light&#8208;based cancer treatments such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been a challenge. While several NIR&#8208;Ru(II) scaffolds have been reported, this approach has not been proven in cells. This is the first report of NIR&#8208;Ru(II) PSs that are phototoxic to cancer cells, including highly pigmented B16F10 melanoma cells. The PS family incorporated a bis(1,8&#8208;naphthyridine)&#8208;based ligand (tpbn), a bidentate thiophene&#8208;based ligand (nT; n=0&#8211;4), and a monodentate 4&#8208;picoline ligand (4&#8208;pic). All compounds absorbed light &gt;800 nm with maxima near 730 nm. Transient absorption (TA) measurements indicated that n&#8805;4 thiophene rings (4T) positioned the PDT&#8208;active triplet intraligand charge transfer (3ILCT) excited state in energetic proximity to the lowest lying triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT). 4T had low micromolar phototoxicity with PIvis and PI733nm values as large as 90 and 12, respectively. Spectroscopic studies suggested that the long&#8208;lived (&#964;TA=3&#8211;6 &#181;s) 3ILCT was accessible from the 3MLCT state, but energetically uphill in the overall photophysics. The study highlights that phototoxic effects can be achieved with NIR&#8208;absorbing Ru(II) PSs as long as the reactive 3ILCT states are energetically accessible from the low&#8208;energy 3MLCT states. It also demonstrates that tissue&#8208;penetrating NIR light can be used to activate the PSs in highly pigmented cells where melanin attenuates shorter wavelengths of light.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The design of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;active photosensitizers (PSs) for light&#8208;based cancer treatments such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been a challenge. While several NIR&#8208;Ru(II) scaffolds have been reported, this approach has not been proven in cells. This is the first report of NIR&#8208;Ru(II) PSs that are phototoxic to cancer cells, including highly pigmented B16F10 melanoma cells. The PS family incorporated a bis(1,8&#8208;naphthyridine)&#8208;based ligand (tpbn), a bidentate thiophene&#8208;based ligand (nT; n=0&#8211;4), and a monodentate 4&#8208;picoline ligand (4&#8208;pic). All compounds absorbed light &amp;gt;800 nm with maxima near 730 nm. Transient absorption (TA) measurements indicated that n&#8805;4 thiophene rings (4T) positioned the PDT&#8208;active triplet intraligand charge transfer (3ILCT) excited state in energetic proximity to the lowest lying triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT). 4T had low micromolar phototoxicity with PIvis and PI733nm values as large as 90 and 12, respectively. Spectroscopic studies suggested that the long&#8208;lived (&#964;TA=3&#8211;6 &#181;s) 3ILCT was accessible from the 3MLCT state, but energetically uphill in the overall photophysics. The study highlights that phototoxic effects can be achieved with NIR&#8208;absorbing Ru(II) PSs as long as the reactive 3ILCT states are energetically accessible from the low&#8208;energy 3MLCT states. It also demonstrates that tissue&#8208;penetrating NIR light can be used to activate the PSs in highly pigmented cells where melanin attenuates shorter wavelengths of light.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>2&#8208;Aminobenzothiazoles inhibit virulence gene expression and block polymyxin resistance in Salmonella enterica</title>
      <dc:description>One promising strategy to combat antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria is to develop compounds that block bacterial defenses against antibacterial conditions produced by the innate immune system. Salmonella enterica , which causes food&#8208;borne gastroenteritis and typhoid fever, requires histidine kinases to resist innate immune defenses such as cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs). Here, we report that 2&#8208;aminobenzothiazoles block histidine kinase&#8208;dependent phenotypes in Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium. We found that 2&#8208;aminobenzothiazoles inhibited growth in low Mg  2+  , a stressful condition that requires histidine kinase&#8208;mediated responses, and decreased expression of the virulence genes pagC and pagK . Furthermore, we discovered that 2&#8208;aminobenzothiazoles weaken Salmonella &#8217;s resistance to polymyxin B and polymyxin E, which are last&#8208;line antibiotics and models for host defense CAMPs. These findings raise the possibilities that 2&#8208;aminobenzothiazoles can block HK&#8208;mediated bacterial defenses and can be used in combination with polymyxins to treat infections caused by Salmonella .</dc:description>

      <title>Engineering a Highly Active Sucrose Isomerase for Enhanced Product Specificity by Using a &#8220;Battleship&#8221; Strategy</title>
      <dc:description>
A sweet victory: A semirational protein engineering strategy inspired by the &#8220;battleship&#8221; board game was applied to systematically improve the product spectrum of the sucrose isomerase SmuA from S. plymuthica with regard to yielding the artificial sweetener isomaltulose at higher purity (94.7&#8201;%) and with significantly lower contamination of the hygroscopic by&#8208;product trehalulose (1.5&#8201;%).







Abstract
The sucrose isomerase SmuA from Serratia plymuthica efficiently catalyses the isomerisation of sucrose into isomaltulose, an artificial sweetener used in the food industry. However, the formation of a hygroscopic by&#8208;product, trehalulose, necessitates additional separation to obtain a crystalline product. Therefore, we have improved the product specificity of SmuA by first introducing a few exploratory amino acid exchanges around the active site and investigating their influence. Then, we devised a second set of mutations, either at promising positions from the preceding cycle, but with a different side chain, or at alternative positions in the vicinity. After seven iterative cycles involving just 55 point mutations, we obtained the triple mutant Y219L/D398G/V465E which showed 2.3 times less trehalulose production but still had high catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM=11.8&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). Not only does this mutant SmuA appear attractive as an industrial biocatalyst, but our semirational protein&#8208;engineering strategy, which resembles the battleship board game, should be of interest for other challenging enzyme optimization endeavours.

      <title>Rhenium&#8208;Based Complexes and in Vivo Testing: A Brief History</title>
      <dc:description>
Beyond cisplatin: The use of animal models, otherwise known as in&#8197;vivo testing, is a crucial step in drug development. To date there have only been nine reported cases of rhenium&#8208;based complexes undergoing in&#8197;vivo testing. This concept article explores the history of these complexes.







Abstract
The success of metal&#8208;based anticancer therapeutics in the treatment of cancer is best exemplified by cisplatin. Currently used in 32/78 cancer regimens, metal&#8208;based drugs have a clear role in cancer therapy. Despite this, metal&#8208;based anticancer therapeutics are not without drawbacks, with issues such as toxic side effects and the development of resistance mechanisms. This has led to investigations of other metal&#8208;based drug candidates such as auranofin, a gold&#8208;based drug candidate as well as ruthenium&#8208;based candidates, NAMI&#8208;A, NKP&#8208;1339 and TLD&#8208;1433. All are currently undergoing clinical trials. Another class of complexes under study are rhenium&#8208;based; such complexes have undergone extensive in&#8197;vitro testing but only nine have been reported to display antitumour in&#8197;vivo activity, which is a necessary step before entering clinical trials. This review will document, chronologically, the rhenium&#8208;based drug candidates that have undergone in&#8197;vivo testing and the outlook for such complexes.

      <dc:description>
Stronger than iron: Ruthenocenyl&#8208;7&#8208;aminocephalosporanic acid bound covalently in the active site of CTX&#8208;M&#8208;14 E166&#8197;A &#946;&#8208;lactamase and showed better antibacterial activity than the ferrocenyl counterpart. The 3&#8208;acetyloxymethyl group was also found to enhance antibacterial activity. These data, provide valuable information for the future development of novel metallocenyl &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics.







Abstract
The conjugation of organometallic groups to current &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics is a field of increasing study due to the ability of certain organometallic groups to enhance the antibiotic potency of these drugs. Herein, we report the antibacterial properties of two metallocenyl (ferrocenyl and ruthenocenyl) 7&#8208;aminocephalosporanic acid (7&#8208;ACA) antibiotic conjugates. Continuing a trend we found in our previous studies, the ruthenocenyl conjugate showed greater antibacterial activity than its ferrocenyl counterpart. Compared with the previously published 7&#8208;aminodesacetoxycephalosporanic acid (7&#8208;ADCA) conjugates, the 3&#8208;acetyloxymethyl group significantly improved the compounds&#8217; activity. Furthermore, the Rc&#8208;7&#8208;ACA compound was more active against clinical Staphylococcus aureus isolates than the ampicillin reference. Noticeably, neither of the two new compounds showed an undesirable toxic effect in HeLa and L929 cells at the concentrations at which they displayed strong antibacterial effects. The antibacterial activity of the two metallocenyl 7&#8208;ACA derivatives was further confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). SEM micrographs showed that bacteria treated with metallocenyl 7&#8208;ACA derivatives feature cell wall damage and morphology changes. Using a CTX&#8208;M&#8208;14 &#946;&#8208;lactamase competition assay based on nitrocefin hydrolysis, we showed that the Rc&#8208;7&#8208;ACA bound more favorably to CTX&#8208;M&#8208;14 than its ferrocenyl counterpart, again confirming the superiority of the ruthenocenyl moiety over the ferrocenyl one in interacting with proteins. We also report a 1.47 &#197; resolution crystal structure of Rc&#8208;7&#8208;ACA in complex with the CTX&#8208;M&#8208;14 E166A mutant, an enzyme sharing a similar active site configuration with penicillin&#8208;binding proteins, the molecular target of &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics. These results strengthen the case for the antibacterial utility of the Rc and Fc groups.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conjugation of organometallic groups to current &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics is a field of increasing study due to the ability of certain organometallic groups to enhance the antibiotic potency of these drugs. Herein, we report the antibacterial properties of two metallocenyl (ferrocenyl and ruthenocenyl) 7&#8208;aminocephalosporanic acid (7&#8208;ACA) antibiotic conjugates. Continuing a trend we found in our previous studies, the ruthenocenyl conjugate showed greater antibacterial activity than its ferrocenyl counterpart. Compared with the previously published 7&#8208;aminodesacetoxycephalosporanic acid (7&#8208;ADCA) conjugates, the 3&#8208;acetyloxymethyl group significantly improved the compounds&#8217; activity. Furthermore, the Rc&#8208;7&#8208;ACA compound was more active against clinical &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; isolates than the ampicillin reference. Noticeably, neither of the two new compounds showed an undesirable toxic effect in HeLa and L929 cells at the concentrations at which they displayed strong antibacterial effects. The antibacterial activity of the two metallocenyl 7&#8208;ACA derivatives was further confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). SEM micrographs showed that bacteria treated with metallocenyl 7&#8208;ACA derivatives feature cell wall damage and morphology changes. Using a CTX&#8208;M&#8208;14 &#946;&#8208;lactamase competition assay based on nitrocefin hydrolysis, we showed that the Rc&#8208;7&#8208;ACA bound more favorably to CTX&#8208;M&#8208;14 than its ferrocenyl counterpart, again confirming the superiority of the ruthenocenyl moiety over the ferrocenyl one in interacting with proteins. We also report a 1.47 &#197; resolution crystal structure of Rc&#8208;7&#8208;ACA in complex with the CTX&#8208;M&#8208;14 E166A mutant, an enzyme sharing a similar active site configuration with penicillin&#8208;binding proteins, the molecular target of &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics. These results strengthen the case for the antibacterial utility of the Rc and Fc groups.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Responsive Fluorophore Aggregation Provides Spectral Contrast for Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging
</title>
      <dc:description>
The value of a short life: The triggered aggregation of small molecules influences the properties of an attached fluorophore. The fluorescent cargo reports a reduced fluorescence lifetime in&#8197;vitro and to an extent detectable in cells by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, thus suggesting possible probe design for lifetime imaging of biological events and analytes.







Abstract
Fluorophores experience altered emission lifetimes when incorporated into and liberated from macromolecules or molecular aggregates; this trend suggests the potential for a fluorescent, responsive probe capable of undergoing self&#8208;assembly and aggregation and consequently altering the lifetime of its fluorescent moiety to provide contrast between the active and inactive probes. We developed a cyanobenzothioazole&#8208;fluorescein conjugate (1), and spectroscopically examined the lifetime changes caused by its reduction&#8208;induced aggregation in&#8197;vitro. A decrease in lifetime was observed for compound 1 in a buffered system activated by the biological reducing agent glutathione, thus suggesting a possible approach for designing responsive self&#8208;aggregating lifetime imaging probes.

      <title>Bifunctional DNA Duplexes Permit Efficient Incorporation of pH Probes into Liposomes</title>
      <dc:description>
Fluorescent pH&#8208;sensitive probes have been trapped in the lumen of liposomes. The sensor is linked to a DNA oligomer that is complementary to a second oligomer with a lipophilic moiety to anchor the DNA conjugate to the inner and outer leaflets of the lipid bilayer. The DNA scaffold allows subsequent selective removal of the probe in the outer bilayer leaflet.







Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;mediated proton transport across biological membranes is critical for many vital cellular processes. pH&#8208;sensitive fluorescent dyes are an indispensable tool for investigating the molecular mechanism of proton&#8208;translocating enzymes. Here, we present a novel strategy to entrap pH&#8208;sensitive probes in the lumen of liposomes that has several advantages over the use of soluble or lipid&#8208;coupled probes. In our approach, the pH sensor is linked to a DNA oligomer with a sequence complementary to a second oligomer modified with a lipophilic moiety that anchors the DNA conjugate to the inner and outer leaflets of the lipid bilayer. The use of DNA as a scaffold allows subsequent selective enzymatic removal of the probe in the outer bilayer leaflet. The method shows a high yield of insertion and is compatible with reconstitution of membrane proteins by different methods. The usefulness of the conjugate for time&#8208;resolved proton pumping measurements was demonstrated by using two large membrane protein complexes.

      <title>Halogenation&#8208;Guided Chemical Screening Provides Insight into Tjipanazole Biosynthesis by the Cyanobacterium Fischerella ambigua</title>
      <dc:description>
Seeking biosynthesis intermediates: The software tool HaloSeeker enabled us to detect halogenated tjipanazole derivatives in the complex HRMS data of an extract from the cyanobacterium F. ambigua. In conjunction with genomic data, this allowed us to propose a biosynthetic pathway for the tjipanazoles. Five isolated derivatives were tested for inhibition of the multidrug resistance transporter ABCG2, revealing structure&#8208;activity relationships.







Abstract
Halogenated natural products (HNPs) show a wide range of interesting biological activities. Chemistry&#8208;guided screening with a software tool dedicated to identifying halogenated compounds in HPLC&#8208;MS data indicated the presence of several uncharacterised HNPs in an extract of the cyanobacterium Fischerella ambigua (N&#228;g.) Gomont 108b. Three new natural products, tjipanazoles K, L, and M, were isolated from this strain together with the known tjipanazoles D and I. Taking into account the structures of all tjipanazole derivatives detected in this strain, reanalysis of the tjipanazole biosynthetic gene cluster allowed us to propose a biosynthetic pathway for the tjipanazoles. As the isolated tjipanazoles show structural similarity to arcyriaflavin A, an inhibitor of the clinically relevant multidrug&#8208;transporter ABCG2 overexpressed by different cancer cell lines, the isolated compounds were tested for ABCG2 inhibitory activity. Only tjipanazole K showed appreciable transporter inhibition, whereas the compounds lacking the pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c] ring or featuring additional chloro substituents were found to be much less active.

      <title>Incorporating Lanthanum into Mesoporous Silica Foam Enhances Enzyme Immobilization and the Activity of Penicillin G Acylase Due to Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Held fast: Enzymes have been immobilized by the strong interaction between the Lewis acid sites on a La&#8208;MCF support and the free lysine amino groups of PGA. The immobilized PGA has both high specific activity and enhanced operational stability. This approach opens up possibilities for developing innovative immobilized enzyme catalytic systems with high stability.







Abstract
Penicillin G acylase (PGA) has been immobilized on a lanthanum&#8208;incorporated mesostructured cellular foam (La&#8208;MCF) support by using the interaction between the strong Lewis acid sites on the surface of La&#8208;MCF and the free amino groups of lysine residues of PGA. The La&#8208;MCF support was successfully synthesized in&#8197;situ through the addition of a citric acid (CA) complexant. The results of pyridine&#8208;IR spectroscopy show the presence of strong Lewis acid sites on the surface of the prepared La&#8208;MCF (with CA), attributed to the incorporation of lanthanum species into the framework of MCF. Through interaction with the strong Lewis acid sites, the enzymes can be firmly immobilized on the surface of the support. The results indicate that PGA/La&#8208;MCF (with CA) exhibits a high specific activity and greatly enhanced operational stability. For the hydrolysis of penicillin G potassium salt, the initial specific activity of PGA/La&#8208;MCF (with CA) reaches 10023&#8197;U/g. Even after being recycled 10 times, PGA/La&#8208;MCF (with CA) retains 89&#8201;% of its initial specific activity, much higher than the 77&#8201;% of PGA/Si&#8208;MCF.

      <title>Light&#8208;Driven ATP Regeneration in Diblock/Grafted Hybrid Vesicles</title>
      <dc:description>
Biocompatible functionality: EFOF1 ATP synthase and bacteriorhodopsin are reconstituted in hybrid vesicles based on grafted polymer PDMS&#8208;g&#8208;PEO and diblock polymer PBd&#8208;PEO. The usage of hybrid vesicles instead of liposomes significantly increases the long&#8208;term stability of the ATP regeneration module.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven ATP regeneration systems combining ATP synthase and bacteriorhodopsin have been proposed as an energy supply in the field of synthetic biology. Energy is required to power biochemical reactions within artificially created reaction compartments like protocells, which are typically based on either lipid or polymer membranes. The insertion of membrane proteins into different hybrid membranes is delicate, and studies comparing these systems with liposomes are needed. Here we present a detailed study of membrane protein functionality in different hybrid compartments made of graft polymer PDMS&#8208;g&#8208;PEO and diblock copolymer PBd&#8208;PEO. Activity of more than 90&#8201;% in lipid/polymer&#8208;based hybrid vesicles could prove an excellent biocompatibility. A significant enhancement of long&#8208;term stability (80&#8201;% remaining activity after 42&#8197;days) could be demonstrated in polymer/polymer&#8208;based hybrids.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Biocompatible functionality&lt;/b&gt;: EF&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ATP synthase and bacteriorhodopsin are reconstituted in hybrid vesicles based on grafted polymer PDMS&#8208;g&#8208;PEO and diblock polymer PBd&#8208;PEO. The usage of hybrid vesicles instead of liposomes significantly increases the long&#8208;term stability of the ATP regeneration module.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light&#8208;driven ATP regeneration systems combining ATP synthase and bacteriorhodopsin have been proposed as an energy supply in the field of synthetic biology. Energy is required to power biochemical reactions within artificially created reaction compartments like protocells, which are typically based on either lipid or polymer membranes. The insertion of membrane proteins into different hybrid membranes is delicate, and studies comparing these systems with liposomes are needed. Here we present a detailed study of membrane protein functionality in different hybrid compartments made of graft polymer PDMS&#8208;g&#8208;PEO and diblock copolymer PBd&#8208;PEO. Activity of more than 90&#8201;% in lipid/polymer&#8208;based hybrid vesicles could prove an excellent biocompatibility. A significant enhancement of long&#8208;term stability (80&#8201;% remaining activity after 42&#8197;days) could be demonstrated in polymer/polymer&#8208;based hybrids.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Supersensitive Multifluorophore RNA&#8208;FISH for Early Virus Detection and Flow&#8208;FISH by Using Click Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
More is less! Increasing the number of fluorophores per oligonucleotide probe allows superb sensitivity, as the fewer the number of probes needed, the lower the background noise. With just a small number of triply labeled strands, RNA&#8208;FISH&#8208;based detection of RNA transcripts was possible in live cells, and a virus could be detected after only 4&#8197;hours.







Abstract
The reliable detection of transcription events through the quantification of the corresponding mRNA is of paramount importance for the diagnostics of infections and diseases. The quantification and localization analysis of the transcripts of a particular gene allows disease states to be characterized more directly compared to an analysis on the transcriptome wide level. This is particularly needed for the early detection of virus infections as now required for emergent viral diseases, e. g. Covid&#8208;19. In situ mRNA analysis, however, is a formidable challenge and currently performed with sets of single&#8208;fluorophore&#8208;containing oligonucleotide probes that hybridize to the mRNA in question. Often a large number of probe strands (&gt;30) are required to get a reliable signal. The more oligonucleotide probes are used, however, the higher the potential off&#8208;target binding effects that create background noise. Here, we used click chemistry and alkyne&#8208;modified DNA oligonucleotides to prepare multiple&#8208;fluorophore&#8208;containing probes. We found that these multiple&#8208;dye probes allow reliable detection and direct visualization of mRNA with only a very small number (5&#8211;10) of probe strands. The new method enabled the in&#8197;situ detection of viral transcripts as early as 4 hours after infection.

      <title>Promotion and Inhibition of the Oxidase&#8208;Mimicking Activity of Nanoceria by Phosphate, Polyphosphate, and DNA</title>
      <dc:description>
The twists of (phos)fate: The oxidase&#8208;like activity of nanoceria can be promoted by phosphate and polyphosphate, whereas the effect of DNA depends on its concentration, the type of buffer and substrate, although the sequence of DNA is less important.







Abstract
Nanoceria (CeO2 nanoparticles) is an extensively studied nanozyme with interesting oxidase&#8208;mimicking activity. As they can work in the absence of toxic and unstable H2O2, CeO2 nanoparticles have been widely used in biosensing. CeO2 nanoparticles often encounter phosphate&#8208;containing molecules that can affect their catalytic activity, and various reports exist in the literature showing both promoted and inhibited activity. In this work, we systematically studied five types of phosphate: orthophosphate, pyrophosphate, triphosphate, trimetaphosphate, and a polyphosphate with 25 phosphate units (Pi25). In addition, DNA oligonucleotides of various length and sequence. DNA was included as they contain a phosphate backbone that can strongly adsorb on nanoceria. We observed that a high concentration of DNA in acetate buffer inhibited activity, whereas a low concentration of DNA in phosphate buffer increased activity. The change of activity was also related to the type of substrate and related to the aggregation of CeO2. These discoveries provide an important understanding for the further use of CeO2 nanoparticles in biosensor development, materials science, and nanotechnology.

      <title>New Nocobactin Derivatives with Antimuscarinic Activity, Terpenibactins A&#8211;C, Revealed by Genome Mining of Nocardia terpenica IFM 0406</title>
      <dc:description>
Nature's combinatorial biosynthesis produces new bioactive nocobactin derivatives. Genome mining led to the discovery and characterization of terpenibactins A&#8722;C, three new nocobactins from the bacterium Nocardia terpenica IFM 0406 that exhibit unprecedented combinations of asteroidic acid, lipid and modified lysine residues. They demonstrate low cytotoxicity but potent inhibitory activity towards the muscarinic M3 receptor.







Abstract
We report a genomics&#8208;guided exploration of the metabolic potential of the brasilicardin producer strain Nocardia terpenica IFM 0406. Bioinformatics analysis of the whole genome sequence revealed the presence of a biosynthetic gene cluster presumably responsible for the generation of formerly unknown nocobactin derivatives. Mass spectrometry&#8208;assisted isolation led to the identification of three new siderophores, terpenibactins A (1), B (2) and C (3), which belong to the class of nocobactins. Their structures were elucidated by employing spectroscopic techniques. Compounds 1&#8211;3 demonstrated inhibitory activity towards the muscarinic M3 receptor, while exhibiting only a low cytotoxicity.

      <title>Recent Development of Photothermal Agents (PTAs) Based on Small Organic Molecular Dyes</title>
      <dc:description>
Photothermal therapy being a noninvasive cancer therapy, there is intense interest in synthesizing highly efficient PTAs that can convert light into heat. In this paper, we highlight recent developments in PTAs based on small&#8208;molecule dyes and discuss the main factors limiting their translation into clinical applications.







Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) has attracted great attention due to its noninvasive and effective use against cancer. Various photothermal agents (PTAs) including organic and inorganic PTAs have been developed in the last decades. Organic PTAs based on small&#8208;molecule dyes exhibit great potential for future clinical applications considering their good biocompatibility and easy chemical modification or functionalization. In this review, we discuss the recent progress of organic PTAs based on small&#8208;molecule dyes for enhanced PTT. We summarize the strategies to improve the light penetration of PTAs, methods to enhance their photothermal conversion efficiency, how to optimize PTAs&#8217; delivery into deep tumors, and how to resist photobleaching under repeated laser irradiation. We hope that this review can rouse the interest of researchers in the field of PTAs based on small&#8208;molecule dyes and help them to fabricate next&#8208;generation PTAs for noninvasive cancer therapy.

      <title>Measuring Enzymatic Activities with Nanopores</title>
      <dc:description>
One to watch: Nanopores have been used to monitor the activities of enzymes; this is referred to as nanopore enzymology. The distinct advantages of nanopore enzymology include long&#8208;timescale observation of enzymatic reactions occurring on a single enzyme and quantitative analyses of kinetics at the single&#8208;molecule level.







Abstract
Nanopores have become powerful and versatile tools for measuring single molecules since their emergence in the mid&#8208;1990s. They can be used to sense a wide variety of analytes including metal ions, small organic molecules, DNA/RNA, proteins, etc. to monitor chemical reactions, and to sequence DNA. Recently, enzymes have been studied by using nanopore technologies. In this Minireview, we highlight recent efforts in developing nanopore enzymology and categorize the related work into three groups: 1) measuring enzymatic activities with nanopore&#8208;enzyme hybrids; 2) measuring enzymatic activities through sensing their catalytic products with nanopores; 3) the use of enzymes for DNA sequencing and DNA/protein translocation. At the end, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in nanopore enzymology.

In this Minireview, we highlight recent efforts in developing nanopore enzymology and categorize the related work into three groups: 1) measuring enzymatic activities with nanopore&#8208;enzyme hybrids; 2) measuring enzymatic activities through sensing their catalytic products with nanopores; 3) the use of enzymes for DNA sequencing and DNA/protein translocation. At the end, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in nanopore enzymology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>C&#8722;N&#8208;Coupled Metabolites Yield Insights into Dynemicin A Biosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>
Biosynthetic coupling: Enediyne antitumor antibiotics from the anthraquinone&#8208;fused subclass feature a C&#8722;N linkage that connects the polyketide&#8208;derived halves of the molecule. Metabolites produced by a dynemicin A biosynthetic gene cluster mutant provide clarity about this unique coupling event and uncover key observations about the chemical origins and timing of this complex natural product pathway.







Abstract
The biosynthesis of the three structural subclasses of enediyne antitumor antibiotics remains largely unknown beyond a common C16&#8208;hexaene precursor. For the anthraquinone&#8208;fused subtype, however, an unexpected iodoanthracene &#947;&#8208;thiolactone was established to be a mid&#8208;pathway intermediate to dynemicin A. Having deleted a putative flavin&#8208;dependent oxidoreductase from the dynemicin biosynthetic gene cluster, we can now report four metabolites that incorporate the iodoanthracene and reveal the formation of the C&#8722;N bond linking the anthraquinone and enediyne halves emblematic of this structural subclass. The coupling of an aryl iodide and an amine is familiar from organometallic chemistry, but has little or no precedent in natural product biosynthesis. These metabolites suggest further that enediyne formation occurs early in the overall biosynthesis, and that even earlier events might convert the C16&#8208;hexaene to a common C15 intermediate that partitions to enediyne and anthraquinone building blocks for the heterodimerization.

      <title>A Peptide&#8208;PNA Hybrid Beacon for Sensitive Detection of Protein Biomarkers in Biological Fluids</title>
      <dc:description>
Needle in a haystack: A fluorescence&#8208;based peptide&#8208;PNA hybrid beacon targeting the S100B protein, a biomarker for brain trauma, has been developed. The molecular beacon is capable of detecting nanomolar concentrations of S100B protein rapidly, even in the presence of serum. The design should be useful for developing molecular beacons for other protein biomarkers.







Abstract
Specific and rapid detection of proteins in biological fluids poses a challenging problem. In biological fluids, many proteins are present at low concentrations, requiring high affinity and specificity of the beacon&#8208;protein interaction. We report the design of a peptide&#8208;PNA hybrid beacon that exploits the dimeric nature of a target protein, S100B, a biomarker for brain trauma, to enhance binding affinity and specificity. The complementary base&#8208;pairing of the PNA bases brings the two arms of the beacon, one carrying an Alexa tag and the other carrying a Dabcyl moiety, into proximity, thus quenching Alexa fluorescence. Each of the arms carries a sequence that binds to one of the subunits. Binding to the target separates the quencher from the probe lifting the quenching of fluorescence. Enhanced affinity and specificity resulting from simultaneously binding to two sites allowed specific detection of S100B at low&#8208;nanomolar concentrations in the presence of serum. The design can be easily adapted for the detection of proteins containing multiple binding sites and could prove useful for rapid and sensitive biomarker detection.

      <title>Dual&#8208;PKS Cluster for Biosynthesis of a Light&#8208;Induced Secondary Metabolite Found from Genome Sequencing of Hyphodiscus hymeniophilus Fungus</title>
      <dc:description>
Red/light metabolite: The fungus H. hymeniophilus produces a red, light&#8208;inducible secondary metabolite. This molecule, hyphodiscorubrin, is shown to be a novel, azaphilone&#8208;like molecule. Whole&#8208;genome sequencing revealed the potential for natural product production, along with the identification of a putative dual&#8208;PKS gene cluster for hyphodiscorubrin production.







Abstract
Filamentous fungi are known producers of important secondary metabolites. In spite of this, the majority of these organisms have not been studied at the genome level, leaving many of the bioactive molecules they produce undiscovered. In this study, we explore the secondary metabolite potential of an understudied fungus, Hyphodiscus hymeniophilus. By sequencing and assembling the first genome from this genus, we show that this fungus has genes for at least 20 natural products and that many of these products are likely novel. One of these metabolites is identified: a new, red&#8208;pigmented member of the azaphilone class, hyphodiscorubrin. We show that this metabolite is only produced when the fungus is grown in the light. Furthermore, the biosynthetic gene cluster of hyphodiscorubrin is identified though homology to other known azaphilone producing clusters.

      <title>Surface Display of Complex Enzymes by in Situ SpyCatcher&#8208;SpyTag Interaction</title>
      <dc:description>
Room for independent folding. A surface display method employs the SpyCatcher&#8208;SpyTag system for post&#8208;translational in&#8197;situ coupling of independently expressed and properly folded passenger enzymes and membrane anchors. The efficient surface display of delicate and complex enzymes expands the toolbox for the fabrication of productive whole&#8208;cell biocatalysts.







Abstract
The display of complex proteins on the surface of cells is of great importance for protein engineering and other fields of biotechnology. Herein, we describe a modular approach, in which the membrane anchor protein Lpp&#8208;OmpA and a protein of interest (passenger) are expressed independently as genetically fused SpyCatcher and SpyTag units and assembled in&#8197;situ by post&#8208;translational coupling. Using fluorescent proteins, we first demonstrate that this strategy allows the construct to be installed on the surface of E. coli cells. The scope of our approach was then demonstrated by using three different functional enzymes, the stereoselective ketoreductase Gre2p, the homotetrameric glucose 1&#8208;dehydrogenase GDH, and the bulky heme&#8208; and diflavin&#8208;containing cytochrome P450 BM3 (BM3). In all cases, the SpyCatcher&#8208;SpyTag method enabled the generation of functional whole&#8208;cell biocatalysts, even for the bulky BM3, which could not be displayed by conventional fusion with Lpp&#8208;OmpA. Furthermore, by using a GDH variant carrying an internal SpyTag, the system could be used to display an enzyme with unmodified N&#8208; and C&#8208;termini.

      <title>Assembly of a DNA Origami Chinese Knot by Only 15% of the Staple Strands</title>
      <dc:description>
A DNA nanostructure with large pores was prepared by a cost&#8208;effective fold&#8208;and&#8208;fill (F&amp;F) strategy. A small number of chemically synthesized DNA strands defined the routing path of a long scaffold DNA strand, then the majority of the supporting strands were enzymatically synthesized in&#8197;situ to define the final geometry.







Abstract
As a giant leap in DNA self&#8208;assembly, DNA origami has exhibited an unprecedented ability to construct nanostructures with arbitrary shapes and sizes. In typical DNA origami, hundreds of short DNA staple strands fold a long, single&#8208;stranded (ss) DNA scaffold cooperatively into designed nanostructures. However, large numbers of DNA strands are expensive and would hinder applications such as pharmaceutical investigations because of the complicated components. Therefore, one challenge is how to reduce the number of staple strands needed to construct DNA origami. For a DNA origami structure, the scale&#8208;free folding pattern of the scaffold strand is determined by staple strands at the branching vertexes. Simple duplex regions help to define the size&#8208;related features of the origami geometry. In this study, we hypothesized that a scaffold strand can be correctly folded into a designed topology by using only staple strands involved in branching vertexes. After assembly, any remaining, flexible, single&#8208;stranded regions of the scaffold could be converted into rigid duplexes by DNA polymerase to achieve the designed geometric structures. To demonstrate the concept, we used only 18 staple strands (covering 15&#8201;% of the scaffold strand) to assemble a porous DNA nanostructure, which was visualized by atomic force microscopy (AFM). This study helps understanding of the role of cooperativity in origami folding, and provides a cost&#8208;effective approach for small&#8208;scale prototyping DNA origami.

This study helps understanding of the role of cooperativity in origami folding, and provides a cost&#8208;effective approach for small&#8208;scale prototyping DNA origami.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Impact of Halogenated Phenylalanine Derivatives on NFGAIL Amyloid Formation</title>
      <dc:description>The hexapeptide hIAPP  22&#8208;27  (NFGAIL) is known as a crucial amyloid core sequence of the human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) whose aggregates can be used to better understand the wild&#8208;type hIAPP's toxicity to &#946;&#8208;cell death. In amyloid research, the role of hydrophobic and aromatic&#8208;aromatic interactions as potential driving forces during the aggregation process is controversially discussed not only in case of NFGAIL, but also for amyloidogenic peptides in general. Here, we used halogenation of the aromatic residue as a strategy to modulate hydrophobic and aromatic&#8208;aromatic interactions and prepared a library of NFGAIL variants containing fluorinated and iodinated phenylalanine analogues. We used thioflavin T staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) to study the impact of side&#8208;chain halogenation on NFGAIL amyloid formation kinetics. Our data revealed a synergy between aggregation behavior and hydrophobicity of the phenylalanine residue. This study introduces systematic fluorination as a toolbox to further investigate the nature of the amyloid self&#8208;assembly process.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Progress in the Synthesis of Homogeneous Erythropoietin (EPO) Glycoforms</title>
      <dc:description>
Getting just what you want: The FDA&#8208;approved glycoprotein erythropoietin (EPO) is an important therapeutic agent and is manufactured by using recombinant protein synthesis, generating a mixture of glycoforms. We highlight recent alternative approaches employing chemical protein synthesis or semisynthesis that produce a single EPO glycoform, thus allowing the roles of the glycans to be more fully understood.







Abstract
Erythropoietin (EPO) has been regarded as a therapeutic glycoprotein for the clinical treatment of anaemia since its approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1989. Commercial production of the 165&#8208;residue glycoprotein is by recombinant protein expression using mammalian cell lines that renders a complex mixture of glycoforms that have an identical amino acid sequence but variations in the structures of the pendant glycans. This heterogeneous nature of human recombinant EPO restricts structural and bioactivity studies in medicinal chemistry. Consequently, chemical synthesis provides an elegant approach for the preparation of complex homogeneous glycoproteins from a readily accessible pool of amino acids and sugars. In addition, the combination of chemical and biosynthesis enables robust and large&#8208;scale production of homogeneous EPO. The scope of this minireview is to summarise the recent advances in the chemical and semisyntheses of homogeneous EPO glycoforms, highlighting the versatile approaches to the preparation and structural manipulations of the carbohydrate chains incorporated into synthetic EPO glycoproteins.

      <title>On the Case of the Misplaced Hydrogens</title>
      <dc:description>Few other elements play a more central role in biology than hydrogen. The interactions, bonding and movement of hydrogen atoms are central to biological catalysis, structure and function. Yet owing to the elusive nature of a single hydrogen atom few experimental and computational techniques can precisely determine its location.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Few other elements play a more central role in biology than hydrogen. The interactions, bonding and movement of hydrogen atoms are central to biological catalysis, structure and function. Yet owing to the elusive nature of a single hydrogen atom few experimental and computational techniques can precisely determine its location. This is exemplified in short hydrogen bonds (SHBs) where the location of the hydrogen is indicative of the underlying strength of the bonds, which can vary from 1&#8208;5 kcal/mol in canonical hydrogen bonds, to an almost covalent nature in single&#8208;well hydrogen bonds.

      <title>Comparison of multiple factors that impact the efficiency of non&#8208;enzymatic DNA ligation: Key parameters for maximizing ligation rates and yields with carbodiimide activation</title>
      <dc:description>Chemical ligation is an important tool for the generation of synthetic DNA structures, which are used for a wide range of applications. Surprisingly, reported chemical ligation yields can range from 30% to 95% for the same chemical activating agent and comparable DNA structures. We report a systematic study of DNA ligation using a well&#8208;defined bimolecular test system and a water&#8208;soluble carbodiimide (EDC) as a phosphate&#8208;activating agent. Our results emphasize the interplay between template&#8208;substrate complex stability and the rates of the chemical steps of ligation, with 3&#180; phosphate substrates providing yields near 100% after 24 hours for particularly favorable reaction conditions. Ligation rates are also shown to be sensitive to the identity of base pairs flanking a nick site, with as much as three&#8208;fold variation. Finally, the observation that DNA substrates are modified by EDC at rates that can be comparable with ligation rates emphasizes the importance of considering side reactions when designing protocols to maximize ligation yields.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of modified galacto&#8208; or fuco&#8208;clusters exploiting siderophore pathway to inhibit LecA or LecB associated virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title>
      <dc:description>Galacto and fuco&#8208;clusters conjugated with one to three catechol or hydroxamate motifs were synthesized to target LecA and LecB lectins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) localized in the outer membrane and in the bacterium. The resulting glycocluster pseudosiderophore conjugates were evaluated as Trojan horse to cross the outer membrane of (PA) thanks to iron transport. The data suggests that glycoclusters with catechol moieties were able to hijack the iron transport while those with hydroxamates showed strong non&#8208;specific interactions. Mono&#8208; and tri&#8208;catechol galactoclusters ( G1C and G3C ) were evaluated as inhibitors of the infection by PA in comparison with the free galactocluster ( G0 ). All of them exhibited an inhibitory effect between 46 to 75% at 100 mM with a higher potency than G0 . This result shows that LecA localized in the outer membrane of PA is involved in the infection mechanism.</dc:description>

      <title>Triplex&#8208;Forming Peptide Nucleic Acids with Extended Backbones</title>
      <dc:description>Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) forms a triple helix with double&#8208;stranded RNA (dsRNA) stabilized by a hydrogen&#8208;bonding zipper formed by PNA&#8217;s backbone amides (N&#8208;H) interacting with RNA phosphate oxygens. This hydrogen&#8208;bonding pattern is enabled by the matching ~5.7 &#197; spacing (typical for A&#8208;form dsRNA) between PNA&#8217;s backbone amides and RNA phosphate oxygens. We hypothesized that extending the PNA&#8217;s backbone by one &#8208;CH2&#8208; group may bring the distance between PNA amide N&#8208;H closer to 7 &#197;, favourable for hydrogen&#8208;bonding to the B&#8208;form dsDNA phosphate oxygens. Extension of PNA backbone was expected to selectively stabilize PNA&#8208;DNA triplexes compared to PNA&#8208;RNA. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized triplex&#8208;forming PNAs that had the pseudopeptide backbones extended by an additional &#8208;CH2&#8208; group in three different positions. Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements of the binding affinity of these extended PNA analogues for the matched dsDNA and dsRNA showed that, contrary to our structural reasoning, extending the PNA backbone at any position had a strong negative effect on triplex stability. Our results suggest that PNA may have an inherent preference for A&#8208;form&#8208;like conformations when binding double&#8208;stranded nucleic acids. It appears that the original six atoms long PNA backbone is an almost perfect fit for binding to A&#8208;form nucleic acids.</dc:description>

      <title>Understanding the glycopeptide antibiotic crosslinking cascade &#8211; in vitro approaches revealing the details of a complex biosynthesis pathway</title>
      <dc:description>The glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) are a fascinating example of complex natural product biosynthesis, with the non&#8208;ribosomal synthesis of the peptide core coupled to a cytochrome P450&#8208;mediated cyclisation cascade that crosslinks aromatic side chains within this peptide. Given the challenges associated with the synthesis of GPAs stems from their highly crosslinked structure, there is great interest in understanding how biosynthesis accomplishes this challenging set of transformations. In this regard, the use of  in vitro  experiments has delivered important insights into this process, including the identification of the unique role of the X&#8208;domain as a platform for P450 recruitment. In this mini&#8208;review, we present an analysis of the results of  in vitro  studies into the GPA cyclisation cascade, which has demonstrated both the tolerances and limitations of this process for modified substrates, and in turn developed rules for the future reengineering of this important antibiotic class.</dc:description>

In this regard, the use of  in vitro  experiments has delivered important insights into this process, including the identification of the unique role of the X&#8208;domain as a platform for P450 recruitment. In this mini&#8208;review, we present an analysis of the results of  in vitro  studies into the GPA cyclisation cascade, which has demonstrated both the tolerances and limitations of this process for modified substrates, and in turn developed rules for the future reengineering of this important antibiotic class.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Distinct mechanisms for processing autophagy protein LC3&#8208;PE by RavZ and ATG4B</title>
      <dc:description>Autophagy is a conserved catabolic process involved in the elimination of proteins, organelles and pathogens. Lipidated LC3 proteins that are conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) play a key role in autophagosome biogenesis. Endogenous ATG4&#8208;mediated deconjugation of LC3&#8208;PE is required for LC3 recycling. However, the  Legionella  effector RavZ irreversibly deconjugates LC3&#8208;PE to inhibit autophagy. It is not clear how ATG4 and RavZ process LC3&#8208;PE with distinct modes. Herein, a series of semi&#8208;synthetic LC3&#8208;PE proteins containing C&#8208;terminal mutations or insertions were used to investigate the relationship of the C&#8208;terminal structure of LC3&#8208;PE with ATG4/RavZ&#8208;mediated deconjugation. Using a combination of molecular docking and biochemical assays, we found that Gln  116  , Phe  119  and Gly  120  of LC3&#8208;PE are required for the cleavage by both RavZ and ATG4B, while Glu  117  (LC3) is specific for the cleavage by RavZ. The molecular ruler mechanism exists in the active site of ATG4B but not in RavZ. Met  63  and Gln  64  at the active site of RavZ are involved in accommodating LC3 C&#8208;terminal motif. Our findings show that the distinct binding modes of LC3 C&#8208;terminal motif (116&#8208;120) with ATG4 and RavZ may determine the specificity of cleavage site.</dc:description>

      <title>A Hydroxyquinoline&#8208;Based Unnatural Amino Acid for the Design of Novel Artificial Metalloenzymes</title>
      <dc:description>
Expanding biotransformations: Several metal&#8208;binding noncanonical amino acids have been incorporated into protein scaffolds to create artificial metalloenzymes. We introduced 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;(8&#8208;hydroxyquinolin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)propanoic acid (HQAla) into lactococcal multidrug&#8208;resistance regulator (LmrR) and complexed it with several transition metal ions such as CuII, ZnII and RhIII to showcase its catalytic potential in a variety of different reactions.







Abstract
We have examined the potential of the noncanonical amino acid (8&#8208;hydroxyquinolin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)alanine (HQAla) for the design of artificial metalloenzymes. HQAla, a versatile chelator of late transition metals, was introduced into the lactococcal multidrug&#8208;resistance regulator (LmrR) by stop codon suppression methodology. LmrR_HQAla was shown to complex efficiently with three different metal ions, CuII, ZnII and RhIII to form unique artificial metalloenzymes. The catalytic potential of the CuII&#8208;bound LmrR_HQAla enzyme was shown through its ability to catalyse asymmetric Friedel&#8208;Craft alkylation and water addition, whereas the ZnII&#8208;coupled enzyme was shown to mimic natural Zn hydrolase activity.

      <title>Probing the Compatibility of an Enzyme&#8208;Linked Immunosorbent Assay toward the Reprogramming of Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Adenylation Domains</title>
      <dc:description>
A reprogramming platform: An enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a combination of small&#8208;molecule probes can detect subtle structural changes in the substrate binding pockets of aryl acid adenylation (A) domains. Combined with a directed&#8208;evolution approach, the ELISA technology can be used to isolate aryl acid A&#8208;domains with the desired activity.







Abstract
An important challenge in natural product biosynthesis is the biosynthetic design and production of artificial peptides. One of the most promising strategies is reprogramming adenylation (A) domains to expand the substrate repertoire of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Therefore, the precise detection of subtle structural changes in the substrate binding pockets of A domains might accelerate their reprogramming. Here we show that an enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a combination of small&#8208;molecule probes can detect the effects of substrate binding pocket residue substitutions in A&#8208;domains. When coupled with a set of aryl acid A&#8208;domain variants (total of nine variants), the ELISA can analyze the subtle differences in their active&#8208;site architectures. Furthermore, the ELISA&#8208;based screening was able to identify the variants with substrate binding pockets that accepted a non&#8208;cognate substrate from an original pool of 45.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A reprogramming platform&lt;/b&gt;: An enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a combination of small&#8208;molecule probes can detect subtle structural changes in the substrate binding pockets of aryl acid adenylation (A) domains. Combined with a directed&#8208;evolution approach, the ELISA technology can be used to isolate aryl acid A&#8208;domains with the desired activity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important challenge in natural product biosynthesis is the biosynthetic design and production of artificial peptides. One of the most promising strategies is reprogramming adenylation (A) domains to expand the substrate repertoire of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Therefore, the precise detection of subtle structural changes in the substrate binding pockets of A domains might accelerate their reprogramming. Here we show that an enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a combination of small&#8208;molecule probes can detect the effects of substrate binding pocket residue substitutions in A&#8208;domains. When coupled with a set of aryl acid A&#8208;domain variants (total of nine variants), the ELISA can analyze the subtle differences in their active&#8208;site architectures. Furthermore, the ELISA&#8208;based screening was able to identify the variants with substrate binding pockets that accepted a non&#8208;cognate substrate from an original pool of 45. These studies demonstrate that ELISA is a reliable platform for providing insights into the active&#8208;site properties of A&#8208;domains and can be applied for the reprogramming of NRPS A&#8208;domains.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trimethylation of the R5 Silica&#8208;Precipitating Peptide Increases Silica Particle Size by Redirecting Orthosilicate Binding</title>
      <dc:description>
Unexpected direction: The silaffin R5 peptide precipitates silica from solutions of orthosilicic acid. Post&#8208;translational modifications in R5 modulate silica morphology. We studied the effect of lysine trimethylation, which installs a positive charge, on silica particle formation. Surprisingly, trimethylation led to larger particle sizes by reducing the maximum activity of R5 and redirecting orthosilicate binding to the R5N terminus.







Abstract
The unmodified R5 peptide from silaffin in the diatom Cylindrotheca fusiformis rapidly precipitates silica particles from neutral aqueous solutions of orthosilicic acid. A range of post&#8208;translational modifications found in R5 contribute toward tailoring silica morphologies in a species&#8208;specific manner. We investigated the specific effect of R5 lysine side&#8208;chain trimethylation, which adds permanent positive charges, on silica particle formation. Our studies revealed that a doubly trimethylated R5K3,4me3 peptide has reduced maximum activity yet, surprisingly, generates larger silica particles. Molecular dynamics simulations of R5K3,4me3 binding by the precursor orthosilicate anion revealed that orthosilicate preferentially associates with unmodified lysine side&#8208;chain amines and the peptide N terminus. Thus, larger silica particles arise from reduced orthosilicate association with trimethylated lysine side chains and their redirection to the N terminus of the R5 peptide.

      <title>Effect of metal shielding on the enzymatic construction of artificial base pairs</title>

      <title>Bioimaging and Biodistribution of the Metal Ion Controlled Self&#8208;Assembly of PYY3&#8208;36 Studied by SPECT/CT</title>
      <dc:description>Controlled self&#8208;assembly of peptide&#8208; and protein&#8208;based pharmaceuticals is of central importance for their mode of action and tuning of their properties. Peptide YY  3&#8208;36  (PYY  3&#8208;36  ) is a 36 amino acid peptide hormone that reduces food intake when peripherally administered. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a PYY  3&#8208;36  analogue functionalized with a metal ion binding 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine ligand which enables self&#8208;assembly through metal complexation. Upon addition of Cu(II), the bipyridine&#8208;modified PYY  3&#8208;36  peptide binds stoichiometric quantities of metal ions in solution and contributes to the organization of higher&#8208;order assemblies. In the current study, we aimed to explore the size effect of the self&#8208;assembly  in vivo  using non&#8208;invasive quantitative Single&#8208;Photon Emission Computed Tomography/Computed Tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging. For this purpose, bipyridine&#8208;modified PYY  3&#8208;36  was radiolabeled with a chelator holding  111  In(III), followed by the addition of Cu(II) to the bipyridine ligand. SPECT/CT imaging and biodistribution studies showed fast renal clearance and accumulation in the kidney cortex. The radiolabeled bipyridyl&#8208;PYY  3&#8208;36  conjugates with and without Cu(II) presented a slightly slower excretion 1 h post injection compared to the unmodified&#8208;PYY  3&#8208;36  demonstrating that higher self&#8208;assemblies of the peptide may have an effect on the pharmacokinetics.</dc:description>

      <title>Probing the Interaction between HIV&#8208;1 Protease and the Homodimeric p66/p66&#8217; Reverse Transcriptase Precursor by Double Electron&#8208;Electron Resonance EPR Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
Opening up p66: Q&#8208;band pulsed double electron&#8208;electron resonance EPR spectroscopy shows that binding of HIV&#8208;1 protease to the asymmetric p66/p66&#8242; homodimer precursor of HIV&#8208;1 reverse transcriptase favours an open conformation of the p66&#8242; subunit allowing the linker connecting the RNaseH and connection domains to bind to the active site of protease in an extended conformation.







Abstract
Following excision from the Gag&#8208;Pol polyprotein, HIV&#8208;1 reverse transcriptase is released as an asymmetric homodimer comprising two p66 subunits that are structurally dissimilar but identical in amino acid sequence. Subsequent cleavage of the RNase H domain from only one of the subunits, denoted p66&#8242;, results in the formation of the mature p66/p51 enzyme in which catalytic activity resides in the p66 subunit, and the p51 subunit (derived from p66&#8242;) provides a supporting structural scaffold. Here, we probe the interaction of the p66/p66&#8242; asymmetric reverse transcriptase precursor with HIV&#8208;1 protease by pulsed Q&#8208;band double electron&#8208;electron resonance EPR spectroscopy to measure distances between nitroxide labels introduced at surface&#8208;engineered cysteine residues. The data suggest that the flexible, exposed linker between the RNaseH and connection domains in the open state of the p66&#8242; subunit binds to the active site of protease in a configuration that is similar to that of extended peptide substrates.

      <title>Convergent Evolution of Fungal Cysteine Dioxygenases</title>
      <dc:description>
Synchronicity: Numerous agaricomycetes contain an unusual cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) that emerged by gene duplication and adaptation from an ergothioneine biosynthetic sulfoxide synthase. It is unrelated to the thiol dioxygenases that occur in animals, plants, and bacteria. The activity of type II CDOs depends on the presence of TMH, thus synchronizing cellular cysteine oxidation with ergothioneine production. OK!







Abstract
Cupin&#8208;type cysteine dioxygenases (CDOs) are non&#8208;heme iron enzymes that occur in animals, plants, bacteria and in filamentous fungi. In this report, we show that agaricomycetes contain an entirely unrelated type of CDO that emerged by convergent evolution from enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of ergothioneine. The activity of this CDO type is dependent on the ergothioneine precursor N&#8208;&#945;&#8208;trimethylhistidine. The metabolic link between ergothioneine production and cysteine oxidation suggests that the two processes might be part of the same chemical response in fungi, for example against oxidative stress.

     alt="Convergent Evolution of Fungal Cysteine Dioxygenases"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synchronicity&lt;/b&gt;: Numerous agaricomycetes contain an unusual cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) that emerged by gene duplication and adaptation from an ergothioneine biosynthetic sulfoxide synthase. It is unrelated to the thiol dioxygenases that occur in animals, plants, and bacteria. The activity of type II CDOs depends on the presence of TMH, thus synchronizing cellular cysteine oxidation with ergothioneine production. &lt;i&gt;OK&lt;/i&gt;!

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cupin&#8208;type cysteine dioxygenases (CDOs) are non&#8208;heme iron enzymes that occur in animals, plants, bacteria and in filamentous fungi. In this report, we show that agaricomycetes contain an entirely unrelated type of CDO that emerged by convergent evolution from enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of ergothioneine. The activity of this CDO type is dependent on the ergothioneine precursor &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;&#945;&#8208;trimethylhistidine. The metabolic link between ergothioneine production and cysteine oxidation suggests that the two processes might be part of the same chemical response in fungi, for example against oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Analysis of Modified Nucleotide Aptamer Library Generated by Thermophilic DNA Polymerases</title>
      <dc:description>
To select aptamers with modified nucleotides, the appropriate DNA polymerase must be designated. We studied eight polymerases and demonstrated that incorporating a tryptophan&#8208;like nucleotide into aptamer libraries by emulsion PCR and KOD XL had an insignificant effect on the PCR bias and did not distort the sequence space, thus making this approach the method of choice.







Abstract
One of the pivotal steps in aptamer selection is the amplification of target&#8208;specific oligonucleotides by thermophilic DNA polymerases; it can be a challenging task if nucleic acids possessing modified nucleotides are to be amplified. Hence, the identification of compatible DNA polymerase and modified nucleotide pairs is necessary for effective selection of aptamers with unnatural nucleotides. We present an in&#8208;depth study of using 5&#8208;indolyl&#8208;AA&#8208;dUTP (TAdUTP) to generate oligonucleotide libraries for aptamer selection. We found that, among the eight studied DNA polymerases, only Vent(exo&#8208;) and KOD XL are capable of adapting TAdUTP, and that replacing dTTP did not have a significant effect on the productivity of KOD XL. We demonstrated that water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsion PCR is suitable for the generation of aptamer libraries of modified nucleotides. Finally, high&#8208;throughput sequence analysis showed that neither the error rate nor the PCR bias was significantly affected by using TAdUTP. In summary, we propose that KOD XL and TAdUTP could be effectively used for aptamer selection without distorting the sequence space of random oligonucleotide libraries.

      <title>The Rieske Oxygenase SnoT Catalyzes 2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;Hydroxylation of l&#8208;Rhodosamine in Nogalamycin Biosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>
Order! The binding of nogalamycin to DNA is facilitated by its carbohydrate units. The 2&#8220;&#8208; and 4&#8221;&#8208;hydroxy groups of l&#8208;nogalamine are particularly important for the bioactivity due to hydrogen bonding interactions. We have elucidated the biosynthetic steps for l&#8208;nogalamine formation and show that SnoT installs the 2&#8220;&#8208;hydroxy group, followed by 2&#8211;5&#8221;&#8208;carbocyclization and 4&#8220;&#8208;epimerization by SnoK and SnoN, respectively.







Abstract
Nogalamycin is an anthracycline anti&#8208;cancer agent that intercalates into the DNA double helix. The binding is facilitated by two carbohydrate units, l&#8208;nogalose and l&#8208;nogalamine, that interact with the minor and major grooves of DNA, respectively. However, recent investigations have shown that nogalamycin biosynthesis proceeds through the attachment of l&#8208;rhodosamine (2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;epi&#8208;l&#8208;nogalamine) to the aglycone. Herein, we demonstrate that the Rieske enzyme SnoT catalyzes 2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;hydroxylation of l&#8208;rhodosamine as an initial post&#8208;glycosylation step. Furthermore, we establish that the reaction order continues with 2&#8211;5&#8242;&#8242; carbocyclization and 4&#8242;&#8242; epimerization by the non&#8208;heme iron and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate&#8208;dependent enzymes SnoK and SnoN, respectively. These late&#8208;stage tailoring steps are important for the bioactivity of nogalamycin due to involvement of the 2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208; and 4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy groups of l&#8208;nogalamine in hydrogen bonding interactions with DNA.

      <title>Insight into Isoprenoid Biosynthesis by Functional Analysis of Isoprenyl Diphosphate Synthases from Mycobacterium vanbaalenii and Mycobacterium tuberculosis</title>
      <dc:description>
Analysis of E&#8208;IDSs from Mycobacterium species has clarified their functions: Mv0992 and Mv1577 would be E&#8208;C45 and E&#8208;C20 synthases, respectively; Mv3536 (an E&#8208;C10&#8211;20 synthase) released an E&#8208;C10 intermediate during continuous condensation; Rv0562 and Rv2173 had similar functions to Mv0992 and Mv3536, respectively; and reduced allylic diphosphate could be used as a substrate for Z&#8208;IDS (Mv3822).







Abstract
Comprehensive functional analyses of E&#8208;isoprenyl diphosphate synthases (E&#8208;IDSs) from nonpathogenic Mycobacterium vanbaalenii have been performed. Mv0992 and Mv1577 represent a nonaprenyl diphosphate (E&#8208;C45) synthase and a geranylgeranyl diphosphate (E&#8208;C20) synthase, respectively. Although Mv3536 was identified as an E&#8208;C20 synthase using a single enzyme, co&#8208;incubation of Mv3536 and Z&#8208;IDSs (Mv4662 and Mv3822) strongly suggested it releases an intermediate geranyl diphosphate (E&#8208;C10) during a continuous condensation reaction. Mv0992 and Mv3536 functions differed from those of the previously reported pathogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis homologues Rv0562 and Rv2173, respectively. Re&#8208;analysis of Rv0562 and Rv2173 demonstrated that their functions were similar to those of Mv0992 and Mv3536 (Rv0562: E&#8208;C45 synthase; Rv2173: E&#8208;C10&#8211;15 synthase). The newly proposed functions of Rv0562 and Rv2173 would be in the biosynthesis of menaquinone and glycosyl carrier lipids essential for growth. Furthermore, a reduced allylic diphosphate could be used as the Z&#8208;IDS of the Mv3822 substrate, thereby introducing a potentially novel pathway of cyclic sesquarterpene biosynthesis.

      <title>Photochemical RNA Editing of C to U by Using Ultrafast Reversible RNA Photo&#8208;crosslinking in DNA/RNA Duplexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Pinpoint C to U conversion: We evaluated the influence of the bases surrounding the target cytosine on the conversion of cytosine to uracil in the RNA strand. The most hydrophilic photo&#8208;crosslinker induced the fastest deamination of cytosine. Inosine, which forms two hydrogen bonds with cytosine, was the most efficiently paired base for accelerating photochemical RNA editing.







Abstract
RNA editing, which is used to edit nucleobases in RNA strands; is more feasible for use in medical applications than DNA editing. We previously reported the photochemical conversion of cytosine to uracil, which required photo&#8208;crosslinking, deamination, and photo&#8208;splitting. Here, we evaluated the influence of the bases surrounding the target cytosine on the conversion of cytosine to uracil in the RNA strand. The photo&#8208;crosslinker 3&#8208;carboxyvinylcarbazole(OHVK), which is more hydrophilic than 3&#8208;cyanovinylcarbazole(CNVK), 3&#8208;carboxyamidevinylcarbazole(NH2VK), and 3&#8208;methoxy carbonylvinylcarbazole(OMeVK), induced faster deamination of cytosine. Furthermore, inosine, which forms two hydrogen bonds with cytosine, was the most efficiently paired base for accelerating photochemical RNA editing. Upon evaluation of the conversion from cytosine to uracil in RNA, the use of oligodeoxynucleotides containing OHVK and inosine and the polarity of the bases surrounding the target cytosine were found to be crucial.

      <title>Cofactors as Molecular Fossils To Trace the Origin and Evolution of Proteins</title>
      <dc:description>
Mutual support: Cofactors play important roles in the origin and evolution of proteins. Nucleotide&#8208;containing cofactors might have facilitated the origin of primitive proteins by selecting them from random amino acid sequences. Metallic cofactors also link protein evolution with geochemical variations; this provides further evidence supporting the coevolution of biochemistry and geochemistry.







Abstract
Due to their early origin and extreme conservation, cofactors are valuable molecular fossils for tracing the origin and evolution of proteins. First, as the order of protein folds binding with cofactors roughly coincides with protein&#8208;fold chronology, cofactors are considered to have facilitated the origin of primitive proteins by selecting them from pools of random amino acid sequences. Second, in the subsequent evolution of proteins, cofactors still played an important role. More interestingly, as metallic cofactors evolved with geochemical variations, some geochemical events left imprints in the chronology of protein architecture; this provides further evidence supporting the coevolution of biochemistry and geochemistry. In this paper, we attempt to review the molecular fossils used in tracing the origin and evolution of proteins, with a special focus on cofactors.

      <title>Towards Zwitterionic Oligonucleotides with Improved Properties: the NAA/LNA&#8208;Gapmer Approach</title>
      <dc:description>Oligonucleotides (ON) are promising therapeutic candidates, for instance by blocking endogenous mRNA (antisense mechanism). However, ON usually require structural modifications of the native nucleic acid backbone to ensure satisfying pharmacokinetic properties. One such strategy to design novel antisense oligonucleotides is the replacement of native phosphate diester units by positively charged artificial linkages, thus leading to (partially) zwitterionic backbone structures. Herein, we report a gapmer architecture comprised of one zwitterionic central segment ('gap') containing nucleosyl amino acid (NAA)&#8208;modifications and two outer segments of locked nucleic acid (LNA). This NAA/LNA&#8208;gapmer approach furnished a partially zwitterionic ON with optimised properties: (i) the formation of stable ON&#8208;RNA duplexes with base&#8208;pairing fidelity and superior target selectivity at 37 &#176;C; and (ii) excellent stability in complex biological media. Overall, the NAA/LNA&#8208;gapmer approach is thus established as a strategy to design partially zwitterionic ON for the future development of novel antisense agents.</dc:description>

      <title>Macrocyclization of a ligand targeting a toxic RNA dramatically improves potency</title>
      <dc:description>RNA molecules both contribute to and are causative of many human diseases. One method to perturb RNA function is to target its structure with small molecules. However, discovering bioactive ligands for RNA targets is challenging. Here, we show that the bioactivity of a linear dimeric ligand that inactivates the RNA trinucleotide repeat expansion that causes myotonic dystrophy type 1 [DM1; r(CUG)exp] can be improved by macrocyclization. Indeed, the macrocyclic compound is 10&#8208;fold more potent than the linear compound for improving DM1&#8208;associated defects in cells, including in patient&#8208;derived myotubes (muscle cells). This enhancement in potency is due to the macrocycle&#8217;s increased affinity and selectivity for the target, thereby inhibiting r(CUG)exp&#8217;s toxic interaction with muscleblind&#8208;like 1 (MBNL1), and its superior cell permeability. Macrocyclization may prove an effective way to enhance the bioactivity of modularly assembled ligands targeting RNA.</dc:description>

      <title>Multivalent Antibody&#8208;Recruiting Macromolecules: Linking Increased Binding Affinity with Enhanced Innate Immune Killing</title>
      <dc:description>
Into the line of fire: Macromolecular antibody recruiting molecules can bind though multivalent interaction with endogenous antibodies and draw these to the surface of target cells or pathogen, thereby marking the latter for innate immune destruction.







Abstract
Antibody&#8208;recruiting molecules (ARMs) are a novel class of immunotherapeutics. They are capable of introducing antibodies onto disease&#8208;relevant targets such as cancer cells, bacterial cells or viruses. This can induce antibody&#8208;mediated immune responses such as antibody&#8208;dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody&#8208;dependent phagocytosis (ADCP), which can kill the pathogen. In contrast to the classic ARMs, multivalent ARMs could offer the advantage of increasing the efficiency of antibody recruitment and subsequent innate immune killing. Such compounds consist of multiple target&#8208;binding termini (TBT) and/or antibody&#8208;binding termini (ABT). Those multivalent interactions are able to convert low binding affinities into increased binding avidities. This minireview summarizes the current status of multivalent ARMs and gives insight into possible benefits, hurdles still to be overcome and future perspectives.

      <title>Exploring the Chemoselectivity towards Cysteine Arylation by Cyclometallated AuIII Compounds: New Mechanistic Insights</title>
      <dc:description>
Getting your gold right: Cyclometallated AuIII complexes with bidentate C^N&#8208;donor ligands enable chemoselective cysteine modification of peptides by C&#8722;S bond&#8208;forming reductive elimination. By using combined high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry and QM/MM studies, further understanding of the mechanisms of AuIII&#8208;templated cross&#8208;coupling leading to cysteine arylation was achieved; this is essential to design selective gold compounds for bio&#8208;orthogonal reactions.







Abstract
To gain more insight into the factors controlling efficient cysteine arylation by cyclometallated AuIII complexes, the reaction between selected gold compounds and different peptides was investigated by high&#8208;resolution liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR&#8208;LC&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS). The deduced mechanisms of C&#8722;S cross&#8208;coupling, also supported by density functional theory (DFT) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations, evidenced the key role of secondary peptidic gold binding sites in favouring the process of reductive elimination.

      <title>Increased Lipophilicity of Halogenated Ruthenium(II) Polypyridyl Complexes Leads to Decreased Phototoxicity in&#8197;vitro when Used as Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
One up, one down: RuII polypyridyl complexes are prime candidates for the development of new photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy. Increasing their lipophilicity could result in improved pharmacological properties. The relationship between lipophilicity and in&#8197;vitro phototoxicity of halogenated RuII complexes was investigated.







Abstract
In the fight against cancer, photodynamic therapy is generating great interest thanks to its ability to selectively kill cancer cells without harming healthy tissues. In this field, ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes, and more specifically, complexes with dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c]phenazine (dppz) as a ligand are of particular interest due to their DNA&#8208;binding and photocleaving properties. However, ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes can sometimes suffer from low lipophilicity, which hampers cellular internalisation through passive diffusion. In this study, four new [Ru(dppz&#8208;X2)3]2+ complexes (X=H, F, Cl, Br, I) were synthesized and their lipophilicity (logP), cytotoxicity and phototoxicity on cancerous and noncancerous cell lines were assessed. This study shows that, counterintuitively, the phototoxicity of these complexes decreases as their lipophilicity increases; this could be due solely to the atomic radius of the halogen substituents.

      <title>Chemical Knockdown of MicroRNA with Small&#8208;Molecule Chimeras</title>
      <dc:description>
Targeting &#8220;undruggable&#8221; RNA: In this concept article, we introduce the development and application of small&#8208;molecule chimeras (SMCs) to the targeted degradation of microRNAs. Due to their high specificity and potency, SMCs present an unprecedented chemical approach to knock down endogenous miRNAs, and thus should contribute to both biological discovery and therapeutic development.







Abstract
This concept article introduces the emerging area of small&#8208;molecule chimeras (SMCs) for knocking down microRNAs (miRNAs), which are endogenous gene silencers involved in diverse pathological processes. Compared with agents for genetic knockdown, small&#8208;molecules hold significant promise in this field due to their ideal pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. The SMCs introduced here are hetero&#8208;bifunctional molecules comprising small&#8208;molecule binders (SMBs) of miRNAs and chemical functionalities that either directly cleave RNAs or recruit ribonucleases to destroy RNAs. Binding of SMBs to miRNAs brings SMCs&#8217; chemical functionalities close to the miRNA, eventually causing miRNA degradation. Compared with parent SMBs, SMCs exhibit remarkably enhanced potency and specificity in miRNA inhibition. The development and application of SMCs for miRNAs will be discussed.

      <title>Nonhydrolyzable Heptose Bis&#8208; and Monophosphate Analogues Modulate Pro&#8208;inflammatory TIFA&#8208;NF&#8208;&#954;B Signaling</title>
      <dc:description>
Small change, big difference: A series of nonhydrolyzable analogues of bacterial heptosides has been synthesized and assayed on whole cells. Interestingly, depending on the functional groups at the 7&#8208;position of the heptose scaffold and in the vicinity of the anomeric position, some molecules could trigger an inflammatory response whereas others were antagonists of heptose&#8208;1,7&#8208;bisphosphate.







Abstract
d&#8208;Glycero&#8208;d&#8208;manno&#8208;heptose&#8208;1&#946;,7&#8208;bisphosphate (HBP) and d&#8208;glycero&#8208;d&#8208;manno&#8208;heptose&#8208;1&#946;&#8208;phosphate (H1P) are bacterial metabolites that were recently shown to stimulate inflammatory responses in host cells through the activation of the TIFA&#8208;dependent NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway. To better understand structure&#8208;based activity in relation to this process, a family of nonhydrolyzable phosphonate analogues of HBP and H1P was synthesized. The inflammation modulation by which these molecules induce the TIFA&#8208;NF&#8208;&#954;B signal axis was evaluated in&#8197;vivo at a low&#8208;nanomolar concentration (6&#8197;nM) and compared to that of the natural metabolites. Our data showed that three phosphonate analogues had similar stimulatory activity to HBP, whereas two phosphonates antagonized HBP&#8208;induced TIFA&#8208;NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling. These results open new horizons for the design of pro&#8208;inflammatory and innate immune modulators that could be used as vaccine adjuvant.

      <title>Crossing the Border: From Keto&#8208; to Imine Reduction in Short&#8208;Chain Dehydrogenases/Reductases</title>
      <dc:description>
Willing to learn: In the context of enzymatic asymmetric reduction SDRs are mainly known for their ability to reduce ketones, rather than imines. However, both activities are based on the same catalytic triad. Using a rational approach inspired by two imine&#8208;reducing SDRs, the keto&#8208;reducing M77_SDR was equipped with imine&#8208;reducing capability.







Abstract
The family of NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent short&#8208;chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs) comprises numerous biocatalysts capable of C=O or C=C reduction. The highly homologous noroxomaritidine reductase (NR) from Narcissus sp. aff. pseudonarcissus and Zt_SDR from Zephyranthes treatiae, however, are SDRs with an extended imine substrate scope. Comparison with a similar SDR from Asparagus officinalis (Ao_SDR) exhibiting keto&#8208;reducing activity, yet negligible imine&#8208;reducing capability, and mining the Short&#8208;Chain Dehydrogenase/Reductase Engineering Database indicated that NR and Zt_SDR possess a unique active&#8208;site composition among SDRs. Adapting the active site of Ao_SDR accordingly improved its imine&#8208;reducing capability. By applying the same strategy, an unrelated SDR from Methylobacterium sp. 77 (M77_SDR) with distinct keto&#8208;reducing activity was engineered into a promiscuous enzyme with imine&#8208;reducing activity, thereby confirming that the ability to reduce imines can be rationally introduced into members of the &#8220;classical&#8221; SDR enzyme family. Thus, members of the SDR family could be a promising starting point for protein approaches to generate new imine&#8208;reducing enzymes.

      <title>First Ring&#8208;Expanded Maytansin Lactone Accessed by a New Mutasynthetic Variant</title>
      <dc:description>
Make it larger! A new variant of the chemo&#8208;biosynthetic concept of mutasynthesis using a multiblocked strain of the ansamitocin producer A. pretiosum yielded new macrolactam proansamitocins as well as the first ring&#8208;expanded maytansin macrolactone.







Abstract
A multiblocked mutant strain (&#916;AHBA and &#916;asm12, asm21) of Actinosynnema pretiosum, the producer of the highly toxic maytansinoid ansamitocin, has been used for the mutasynthetic production of new proansamitocin derivatives. The use of mutant strains that are blocked in the biosynthesis of an early building block as well as in the expression of two tailoring enzymes broadens the scope of chemo&#8208;biosynthetic access to new maytansinoids. Remarkably, a ring&#8208;expanded macrolactone derived from ansamitocin was created for the first time.

      <title>Molecular Recognition in C&#8208;Type Lectins: The Cases of DC&#8208;SIGN, Langerin, MGL, and L&#8208;Sectin</title>
      <dc:description>
Fine specificity: The interaction of glycans with C&#8208;type lectin receptors (CLRs) mediates the dissemination of infections and is strongly related to the immune response. In this review, we emphasize the molecular recognition features of four of the most studied CLRs of group II: DC&#8208;SIGN, Langerin, MGL and LSECtin







Abstract
Carbohydrates play a pivotal role in intercellular communication processes. In particular, glycan antigens are key for sustaining homeostasis, helping leukocytes to distinguish damaged tissues and invading pathogens from healthy tissues. From a structural perspective, this cross&#8208;talk is fairly complex, and multiple membrane proteins guide these recognition processes, including lectins and Toll&#8208;like receptors. Since the beginning of this century, lectins have become potential targets for therapeutics for controlling and/or avoiding the progression of pathologies derived from an incorrect immune outcome, including infectious processes, cancer, or autoimmune diseases. Therefore, a detailed knowledge of these receptors is mandatory for the development of specific treatments. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about four key C&#8208;type lectins whose importance has been steadily growing in recent years, focusing in particular on how glycan recognition takes place at the molecular level, but also looking at recent progresses in the quest for therapeutics.

      <title>Targeted Discovery of Tetrapeptides and Cyclic Polyketide&#8208;Peptide Hybrids from a Fungal Antagonist of Farming Termites</title>
      <dc:description>
Chemical treasures of a fungal stowaway: Structural analysis of six new chemical features revealed four linear tetrapeptides and two cyclic NRPS&#8208;polyketide&#8208;derived natural products from the fungal antagonist Pseudoxylaria sp. X187 of fungus&#8208;growing termites.







Abstract
Herein, we report the targeted isolation and characterization of four linear nonribosomally synthesized tetrapeptides (pseudoxylaramide A&#8211;D) and two cyclic nonribosomal peptide synthetase&#8208;polyketide synthase&#8208;derived natural products (xylacremolide A and B) from the termite&#8208;associated stowaway fungus Pseudoxylaria sp. X187. The fungal strain was prioritized for further metabolic analysis based on its taxonomical position and morphological and bioassay data. Metabolic data were dereplicated based on high&#8208;resolution tandem mass spectrometry data and global molecular networking analysis. The structure of all six new natural products was elucidated based on a combination of 1D and 2D NMR analysis, Marfey's analysis and X&#8208;ray crystallography.

     alt="Targeted Discovery of Tetrapeptides and Cyclic Polyketide&#8208;Peptide Hybrids from a Fungal Antagonist of Farming Termites"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chemical treasures of a fungal stowaway&lt;/b&gt;: Structural analysis of six new chemical features revealed four linear tetrapeptides and two cyclic NRPS&#8208;polyketide&#8208;derived natural products from the fungal antagonist &lt;i&gt;Pseudoxylaria&lt;/i&gt; sp. X187 of fungus&#8208;growing termites.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report the targeted isolation and characterization of four linear nonribosomally synthesized tetrapeptides (pseudoxylaramide A&#8211;D) and two cyclic nonribosomal peptide synthetase&#8208;polyketide synthase&#8208;derived natural products (xylacremolide A and B) from the termite&#8208;associated stowaway fungus &lt;i&gt;Pseudoxylaria&lt;/i&gt; sp. X187. The fungal strain was prioritized for further metabolic analysis based on its taxonomical position and morphological and bioassay data. Metabolic data were dereplicated based on high&#8208;resolution tandem mass spectrometry data and global molecular networking analysis. The structure of all six new natural products was elucidated based on a combination of 1D and 2D NMR analysis, Marfey's analysis and X&#8208;ray crystallography.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2,3&#8208;Dihydroxybenzoic Acid Decarboxylase from Fusarium oxysporum: Crystal Structures and Substrate Recognition Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>
It depends on your position: Crystal structure and mutation studies reveal that R233&#916; plays an important role in the substrate recognition of 2,3&#8208;dihydroxybenzoic acid decarboxylase (DHBD) from Fusarium oxysporum, as well as the molecular basis for this enzyme being a 2,3&#8208;DHBD with different substrate preference from known 2,6&#8208;DHBDs and salicylic acid decarboxylases.







Abstract
A 2,3&#8208;dihydroxybenzoic acid decarboxylase from Fusarium oxysporum (2,3&#8208;DHBD_Fo) has a relatively high catalytic efficiency for the decarboxylation of 2,3&#8208;dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) and carboxylation of catechol, thus it has a different substrate spectrum from other benzoic acid decarboxylases. We have determined the structures of 2,3&#8208;DHBD_Fo in its apo form and complexes with catechol or 2,5&#8208;dihydroxybenzoic acid at 1.55, 1.97, and 2.45&#8197;&#197; resolution, respectively. The crystal structures of 2,3&#8208;DHBD_Fo show that the enzyme exists as a homotetramer, and each active center has a Zn2+ ion coordinated by E8, H167, D291 and three water molecules. This is different from 2,6&#8208;DHBD from Rhizobium sporomusa, in which the Zn2+ ion is also coordinated with H10. Surprisingly, mutation of A10 of 2,3&#8208;DHBD_Fo to His resulted in almost complete loss of the enzyme activity. Enzyme&#8208;substrate docking and site&#8208;directed mutation studies indicate that residue R233&#916; interacts with the 3&#8208;hydroxy group of 2,3&#8208;DHBA, and plays an important role in substrate recognition for this enzyme, thus revealing the molecular basis 2,3&#8208;dihydroxybenzoic acid decarboxylase.

      <title>Reexamination of the Ergothioneine Biosynthetic Methyltransferase EgtD from Mycobacterium tuberculosis as a Protein Kinase Substrate</title>
      <dc:description>
Conformer conundrum: The histidine methyltransferase EgtD produces N&#8208;&#945;&#8208;trimethylhistidine as the first intermediate of ergothioneine biosynthesis in M. tuberculosis. This enzyme can be regulated by kinase&#8208;mediated phosphorylation. However, in&#8197;vitro characterization of this process suggests that folded EgtD is a poor substrate for protein kinase D (PknD).







Abstract
Ergothioneine has emerged as a crucial cytoprotectant in the pathogenic lifestyle of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Production of this antioxidant from primary metabolites may be regulated by phosphorylation of Thr213 in the active site of the methyltransferase EgtD. The structure of mycobacterial EgtD suggests that this post&#8208;translational modification would require a large&#8208;scale change in conformation to make the active&#8208;site residue accessible to a protein kinase. In this report, we show that, under in&#8197;vitro conditions, EgtD is not a substrate of protein kinase PknD.

Phenazine radicals: O&#8208;benzoquinone isoindoline derivatives were condensed with aromatic 1,2&#8208;diamines, followed by oxidation to give phenazine&#8208;di&#8208;N&#8208;oxide isoindoline nitroxides.

Abstract
Two o&#8208;benzoquinone derivatives of isoindoline were synthesized for use as building blocks to incorporate isoindoline nitroxides into different compounds and materials. These o&#8208;quinones were condensed with a number of o&#8208;phenylenediamines to form isoindoline&#8208;phenazines in high yields. Subsequent oxidation gave phenazine&#8208;di&#8208;N&#8208;oxide isoindoline nitroxides that were evaluated for noncovalent and site&#8208;directed spin&#8208;labeling of duplex DNA and RNA that contained abasic sites. Although only minor binding was observed for RNA, the unsubstituted phenazine&#8208;N,N&#8208;dioxide tetramethyl isoindoline nitroxide showed high binding affinity and selectivity towards abasic sites in duplex DNA that contained cytosine as the orphan base.

It is further shown that domain&#8208;swapped trimerization can be favored by strategic installation of a disulfide bond, demonstrating a strategy for fold control. We further show the domain&#8208;swapped trimer to be a useful protein design template by installing a high&#8208;affinity metal binding site with the introduction of a single mutation, taking advantage of its 3&#8208;fold symmetry.

      <title>Reversal of Regioselectivity in Zinc&#8208;Dependent Medium&#8208;Chain Alcohol Dehydrogenase from Rhodococcus erythropolis toward Octanone Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
Reversal of regioselectivity: A versatile ADH from R. erythropolis (ReADH) accepts only carbonyl substrates with either a methyl or ethyl group adjacent to carbonyl moiety. Modified ReADH converts bulky substrates (ethyl 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;phenylbutyrate) and opens up a new route for the synthesis of ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;phenylbutanoate, which is an important intermediate for anti&#8208;hypertension drugs like enalaprilat and lisinopril.







Abstract
The zinc&#8208;dependent medium&#8208;chain alcohol dehydrogenase from Rhodococcus erythropolis (ReADH) is one of the most versatile biocatalysts for the stereoselective reduction of ketones to chiral alcohols. Despite its known broad substrate scope, ReADH only accepts carbonyl substrates with either a methyl or an ethyl group adjacent to the carbonyl moiety; this limits its use in the synthesis of the chiral alcohols that serve as a building blocks for pharmaceuticals. Protein engineering to expand the substrate scope of ReADH toward bulky substitutions next to carbonyl group (ethyl 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;phenylbutyrate) opens up new routes in the synthesis of ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;phenylbutanoate, an important intermediate for anti&#8208;hypertension drugs like enalaprilat and lisinopril. We have performed computer&#8208;aided engineering of ReADH toward ethyl 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;phenylbutyrate and octanone derivatives. W296, which is located in the small binding pocket of ReADH, sterically restricts the access of ethyl 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;phenylbutyrate, octan&#8208;3&#8208;one or octan&#8208;4&#8208;one toward the catalytic zinc ion and thereby limits ReADH activity. Computational analysis was used to identify position W296 and site&#8208;saturation mutagenesis (SSM) yielded an improved variant W296A with a 3.6&#8208;fold improved activity toward ethyl 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;phenylbutyrate when compared to WT ReADH (ReADH W296A: 17.10&#8197;U/mg and ReADH WT: 4.7&#8197;U/mg). In addition, the regioselectivity of ReADH W296A is shifted toward octanone substrates. ReADH W296A has a more than 16&#8208;fold increased activity toward octan&#8208;4&#8208;one (ReADH W296A: 0.97&#8197;U/mg and ReADH WT: 0.06&#8197;U/mg) and a more than 30&#8208;fold decreased activity toward octan&#8208;2&#8208;one (ReADH W296A: 0.23&#8197;U/mg and ReADH WT: 7.69&#8197;U/mg). Computational and experimental results revealed the role of position W296 in controlling the substrate scope and regiopreference of ReADH for a variety of carbonyl substrates.

Despite its known broad substrate scope, ReADH only accepts carbonyl substrates with either a methyl or an ethyl group adjacent to the carbonyl moiety; this limits its use in the synthesis of the chiral alcohols that serve as a building blocks for pharmaceuticals. Protein engineering to expand the substrate scope of ReADH toward bulky substitutions next to carbonyl group (ethyl 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;phenylbutyrate) opens up new routes in the synthesis of ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;phenylbutanoate, an important intermediate for anti&#8208;hypertension drugs like enalaprilat and lisinopril. We have performed computer&#8208;aided engineering of ReADH toward ethyl 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;phenylbutyrate and octanone derivatives. W296, which is located in the small binding pocket of ReADH, sterically restricts the access of ethyl 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;phenylbutyrate, octan&#8208;3&#8208;one or octan&#8208;4&#8208;one toward the catalytic zinc ion and thereby limits ReADH activity. Computational analysis was used to identify position W296 and site&#8208;saturation mutagenesis (SSM) yielded an improved variant W296A with a 3.6&#8208;fold improved activity toward ethyl 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;phenylbutyrate when compared to WT ReADH (ReADH W296A: 17.10&#8197;U/mg and ReADH WT: 4.7&#8197;U/mg). In addition, the regioselectivity of ReADH W296A is shifted toward octanone substrates. ReADH W296A has a more than 16&#8208;fold increased activity toward octan&#8208;4&#8208;one (ReADH W296A: 0.97&#8197;U/mg and ReADH WT: 0.06&#8197;U/mg) and a more than 30&#8208;fold decreased activity toward octan&#8208;2&#8208;one (ReADH W296A: 0.23&#8197;U/mg and ReADH WT: 7.69&#8197;U/mg). Computational and experimental results revealed the role of position W296 in controlling the substrate scope and regiopreference of ReADH for a variety of carbonyl substrates.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Planar Chiral Ferrocifens that Show Chiral Discrimination in Antiproliferative Activity on Breast Cancer Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Inaccessible no longer: Enantiopure ferrocifens and ferrociphenols have been efficiently prepared for biological evaluation via a chiral ketone by palladium&#8208;catalysed intramolecular direct C&#8722;H bond activation/cyclisation. IC50 values reveal that S&#8208;configured molecules perform better against an ER+ breast cancer cell line, but the result is less clear in the ER&#8722; case.







Abstract
The design and first enantioselective synthesis of a series of chiral ferrocifens and ferrociphenols was realised by enantioselective palladium&#8208;catalysed intramolecular direct C&#8722;H bond activation followed by McMurry coupling. Biological evaluation revealed moderate anticancer activities on breast cancer cells and evidence of chiral discrimination between enantiomers. Treatment of the novel ferrocifens with Ag2O revealed that these systems are unable to form a neutral quinone methide, yet still demonstrate marked antiproliferative properties against both the hormone&#8208;dependent MCF&#8208;7 and hormone&#8208;independent MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cell lines. This bioactivity arises from two mechanisms: Fenton&#8208;type chemistry and the anti&#8208;estrogenic activity associated with the tamoxifen&#8208;like structure.

      <title>Ribosomal Target&#8208;Binding Sites of Antimicrobial Peptides Api137 and Onc112 Are Conserved among Pathogens Indicating New Lead Structures To Develop Novel Broad&#8208;Spectrum Antibiotics</title>
      <dc:description>
Resisting resistance: Proline&#8208;rich antimicrobial peptides Api137 and especially Onc112 bind strongly to the bacterial (70S) ribosome, even to ribosomes of pathogens that appear to be resistant in standards antibiotic tests. The presented data indicate that Onc112 in particular might represent a valid lead structure to develop broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotics relying on a novel bactericidal mechanism.







Abstract
Proline&#8208;rich antimicrobial peptides expressed in insects are primarily active against Enterobacteriaceae. Mechanistically, they target the bacterial (70S) ribosome after partially transporter&#8208;based cellular uptake, as revealed for Api137 and Onc112 on Escherichia coli. Following molecular modeling indicating that the Onc112 contact site is conserved among the ribosomes of high&#8208;priority pathogens, the ribosome binding of Api137 and Onc112 was studied. The dissociation constants (Kd) of Onc112 were &#8764;75&#8197;nmol/L for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii, 36&#8197;nmol/L for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 102&#8197;nmol/L for Staphylococcus aureus, thus indicating a very promising lead structure for developing broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotics. Api137 bound weaker with Kd values ranging from 155&#8197;nmol/L to 13&#8197;&#956;mol/L. For most bacteria, the antibacterial activities were lower than predicted from the Kd values, which was only partially explained by their ability to enter bacterial cells. Other factors limiting the activity expected from the ribosome binding might be off&#8208;target binding.

      <title>Bacterial Cell Display as a Robust and Versatile Platform for Engineering Low&#8208;Affinity Ligands and Enzymes
</title>
      <dc:description>
Displaying enzymes and low&#8208;affinity binding proteins on the surface of the bacterial cell: A SNAP reporter together with the function&#8208;dependent labelling of the cell with cholesterol&#8208;linked DNA, allows systematic optimisation of cell display, making it a robust and flexible platform for the systematic evolution of XNA molecular biology.







Abstract
Directed evolution has been remarkably successful at expanding the chemical and functional boundaries of biology. That progress is heavily dependent on the robustness and flexibility of the available selection platforms, given the significant cost to (re)develop a given platform to target a new desired function. Bacterial cell display has a significant track record as a viable strategy for the engineering of mesophilic enzymes, as enzyme activity can be probed directly and free from interference from the cellular milieu, but its adoption has lagged behind other display&#8208;based methods. Herein, we report the development of SNAP as a quantitative reporter for bacterial cell display, which enables fast troubleshooting and the systematic development of the display&#8208;based selection platform, thus improving its robustness. In addition, we demonstrate that even weak interactions between displayed proteins and nucleic acids can be harnessed for the specific labelling of bacterial cells, allowing functional characterisation of DNA binding proteins and enzymes, thus making it a highly flexible platform for these biochemical functions. Together, this establishes bacterial display as a robust and flexible platform, ideally suited for the systematic engineering of ligands and enzymes needed for XNA molecular biology.
