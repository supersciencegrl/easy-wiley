      <title>SynBio&#8208;SynChem Approaches to Diversifying the Pacidamycins through the Exploitation of an Observed Pictet&#8208;Spengler Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>A spontaneous Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction has been postulated to give rise to a subset of uridyl peptide antibiotics (UPAs) naturally. The bioactivity of these compounds may be seen to be attenuated. Here, using a combination of strain engineering and synthetic chemistry, we demonstrate that Pictet&#8208;Spengler chemistry may be employed to generate even greater diversity in the UPAs. We use an engineered strain to afford access to&#160;  meta&#8208;  tyrosine containing pacidamycin 4, then apply Pictet&#8208;Spengler diversification of this compound utilising a small series of aryl&#8208;aldehydes with some Pictet&#8208;Spengler diversifications affording remarkable diastereomeric control.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A spontaneous Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction has been postulated to give rise to a subset of uridyl peptide antibiotics (UPAs) naturally. The bioactivity of these compounds may be seen to be attenuated. Here, using a combination of strain engineering and synthetic chemistry, we demonstrate that Pictet&#8208;Spengler chemistry may be employed to generate even greater diversity in the UPAs. We use an engineered strain to afford access to&#160;  meta&#8208;  tyrosine containing pacidamycin 4, then apply Pictet&#8208;Spengler diversification of this compound utilising a small series of aryl&#8208;aldehydes with some Pictet&#8208;Spengler diversifications affording remarkable diastereomeric control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Stabilizing AqdC, a Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal&#8208;Cleaving Dioxygenase from Mycobacteria, by FRESCO&#8208;based Protein Engineering</title>
      <dc:description>The mycobacterial PQS dioxygenase AqdC, a cofactor&#8208;less protein with an &#945;/&#946;&#8208;hydrolase fold, inactivates the virulence&#8208;associated quorum sensing signal molecule 2&#8208;heptyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;quinolone (PQS) produced by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and therefore is a potential anti&#8208;virulence tool. Here, we used computational library design to predict stabilizing amino acid replacements in AqdC. While 57 out of 91 tested single substitutions throughout the protein led to stabilization as judged by increases in Tmapp of &gt;2 &#176;C, they all impaired catalytic activity. Combining substitutions, the proteins AqdC&#8208;G40K&#8208;A134L&#8208;G220D&#8208;Y238W and AqdC&#8208;G40K&#8208;G220D&#8208;Y238W showed extended half&#8208;lives and the best trade&#8208;off between stability and activity, with increases in Tmapp by 11.8 &#176;C and 6.1 &#176;C and relative activities of 22% and 72%, respectively, compared to AqdC. Molecular dynamics simulations and principal component analysis suggested that stabilized proteins are less flexible than AqdC, and loss of catalytic activity likely correlates with inability to effectively open the entrance to the active site.</dc:description>

      <title>Challenges of using Expansion Microscopy for super&#8208;resolved imaging of cellular organelles</title>
      <dc:description>Expansion Microscopy (ExM) has been successfully used to improve the spatial resolution when imaging tissues by optical microscopy. In ExM, proteins of a fixed sample are crosslinked to a swellable acrylamide gel, which enlarges when incubated in water. Therefore, ExM allows to resolve enlarged subcellular structures, otherwise hidden to standard confocal microscopy. Here we aim to validate ExM for the study of peroxisomes, mitochondria, nuclei and the plasma membrane. Upon comparison of the expansion factors of these cellular compartments in HEK293 cells within the same gel, we found significant differences in expansion factors of a factor of above 2. For peroxisomes, the expansion factor differed even between peroxisomal membrane and matrix marker, which underlines the need for a thorough validation of expansion factors of this powerful technique. We further give an overview of possible quantification methods for the determination of expansion factors of intracellular organelles, and we highlight some potentials and challenges.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
Structural and dynamic characterization of highly flexible protein complexes is a major challenge in structural biology. By a combined NMR spectroscopy and MD simulation approach, we studied the complex formed between the disordered p53TAD1&#8208;60 and the metastasis&#8208;associated S100A4. The results indicate that both subdomains of p53TAD1&#8208;60 undergo a disorder&#8208;to&#8208;order transition, with three residues acting as anchor points attached to the binding pockets of S100A4, and a clamp&#8208;like fuzzy complex is formed. More information can be found in the full paper by A. Bodor et&#8197;al.

      <title>The effects of 5&#8208;OP&#8208;RU stereochemistry on its stability and MAIT&#8208;MR1 axis</title>
      <dc:description>Mucosal&#8208;associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are an abundant subset of innate&#8208;like T lymphocytes. MAIT cells are activated by microbial riboflavin&#8208;derived antigens, such as 5&#8208;(2&#8208;oxopropylideneamino)&#8208;6&#8208;D&#8208;ribitylaminouracil (5&#8208;OP&#8208;RU), when presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I&#8208;related protein (MR1). Herein we have synthesized all stereoisomers of 5&#8208;OP&#8208;RU to investigate the effects of its stereochemistry on the MR1&#8208;dependent MAIT cell activation and MR1 upregulation. The analysis of MAIT cell activation by these 5&#8208;OP&#8208;RU isomers revealed that the stereocenters at the 2&#8217;&#8208; and 3&#8217;&#8208;OH groups in the ribityl tail are crucial for the recognition of MAIT&#8208;TCR, while that of 4&#8217;&#8208;OH group does not significantly affect the regulation of MAIT cell activity. Furthermore, the kinetic analysis of complex formation between the ligands and MR1 suggested that 5&#8208;OP&#8208;RU forms a covalent bond to MR1 in cells within 1 hour. These findings provide guidelines for designing ligands that regulate MAIT cell functions.</dc:description>

      <title>Tackling SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Infections using Remdesivir and Favipiravir as Therapeutic Options</title>
      <dc:description>The outbreak of pandemic COVID&#8208;19 causes severe damage to the human world, including infections, deaths, and economic disruptions. The world has focused on developing treatment and controlling measures against COVID&#8208;19. Currently, there is no specific approved therapy or medication for the disease, therefore this pandemic situation demonstrates the immediate need for wide&#8208;ranging antiviral countermeasures to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and future coronaviruses. This article provides an overview of the structure, virology, symptoms, life cycle, and routes of transmission of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. The therapeutic effect of two drugs that are regarded to show therapeutic potential [i.e., remdesivir (RDV) and favipiravir (FPV)] against COVID&#8208;19 are discussed based on the current published data. This review can serve as a reference for future studies.</dc:description>

This article provides an overview of the structure, virology, symptoms, life cycle, and routes of transmission of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. The therapeutic effect of two drugs that are regarded to show therapeutic potential [i.e., remdesivir (RDV) and favipiravir (FPV)] against COVID&#8208;19 are discussed based on the current published data. This review can serve as a reference for future studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Assessment of tractable cysteines by covalent fragments screening</title>
      <dc:description>Targeted covalent inhibition and the use of irreversible chemical probes are important strategies in chemical biology and drug discovery. To date, the availability and reactivity of cysteine residues amenable for covalent targeting have been evaluated by proteomic and computational tools. Here, we present a toolbox of fragments containing a 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl core that was equipped with chemically diverse electrophilic warheads showing a range of reactivities. We characterized the library members for their reactivity, aqueous stability and specificity for nucleophilic amino acids. By screening this library against a set of enzymes amenable for covalent inhibition, we showed that this approach experimentally characterized the accessibility and reactivity of targeted cysteines. Interesting covalent fragment hits were obtained for all investigated cysteine&#8208;containing enzymes.</dc:description>

      <title>Probing the secondary structure of individual A&#946;40 amorphous aggregates and fibrils by AFM&#8208;IR spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Structural characterization of aggregates and fibrils of the A&#946; protein is pivotal to the molecular level elucidation of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD). AFM&#8208;IR provides nanoscale resolution, and thus allows for spectroscopic interrogation of individual aggregates and fibrils. During aggregation of A&#946; we observed mainly disordered A&#946; at t=15 min, substantial structural diversity including co&#8208;existence of parallel and antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheets within a large amorphous aggregate at t=2 hours, while fibrils exhibited the expected signature of parallel &#946;&#8208;sheets at t=1 week. The resonance observed for parallel &#946;&#8208;sheets at t=2 hours coincides with that observed for fibrils (at 1634 cm&#8208;1), indicating that fibril&#8208;like species exist within the large aggregates. Thus, nucleation might occur within such species, in analogy to current theories of protein crystallization where nucleation occurs within large protein clusters. Cu2+ perturbs A&#946; aggregation, catalysing rapid formation of amorphous aggregates with diverse secondary structure, but inhibiting fibril growth.</dc:description>

      <title>Directed Evolution of a Cp*Rh(III)&#8208;linked Biohybrid Catalyst Based on a Screening Platform with Affinity Purification</title>
      <dc:description>Directed evolution of Cp*Rh(III)&#8208;linked nitrobindin (NB), a biohybrid catalyst, was performed based on an in vitro screening approach. A key aspect of this effort was the establishment of a high&#8208;throughput screening (HTS) platform which involves an affinity purification step employing a starch&#8208;agarose resin for a maltose binding protein (MBP)&#8208;tag. The HTS platform enables efficient preparation of the purified MBP&#8208;tagged biohybrid catalysts in a 96&#8208;well format and eliminates background influence of the host E. coli cells. Three rounds of directed evolution and screening of more than 4,000 clones in total yielded a Cp*Rh(III)&#8208;linked NB(T98H/L100K/K127E) variant with a 4.9&#8208;fold enhanced activity for cycloaddition of acetophenone oximes with alkynes.

      <title>Regulation of the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of nGO, MoS2and WS2&#160;nanozymes using metal cations</title>
      <dc:description>Two dimensional nanoparticles (2D&#8208;nps) along with other nanoscale materials have been deemed to be the next generation of artificial enzymes (nanozymes). The low&#8208;cost bulk&#8208;scale production, ease of storage and modification of the nanomaterials have given nanozymes an advantage over the traditional enzymes. Many studies have been aimed at developing methods to increase the performance of these nanozymes, and also identify interfering agents.

      <title>C&#8208;terminal tag location hampers in vitro profiling of OGT peptide substrates by mRNA display</title>
      <dc:description>O  &#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is the only enzyme that catalyzes the post&#8208;translational modification of proteins at Ser/Thr with a single &#946;&#8208;  N  &#8208;acetylglucosamine (  O  &#8208;GlcNAcylation). Its activity has been associated with chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes and neurodegenerative disease. While numerous OGT substrates have been identified, its accepted substrate scope can still be refined. We report here an attempt to better define the peptide recognition requirements of the OGT active site using mRNA display, taking advantage of its extremely high throughput to assess substrate potential of a library of all possible 9&#8208;mer peptides. An antibody&#8208;based selection process is described here that is able to enrich an OGT substrate peptide from such a library, but with poor absolute recovery. Following four rounds of selection for  O  &#8208;GlcNAcylated peptides, sequencing revealed fourteen peptides containing Ser/Thr but these were shown by luminescence&#8208;coupled assays and peptide microarray to not be OGT substrates. By contrast, subsequent testing of an N&#8208;terminal tag approach showed exemplary recovery. Our approach demonstrates the power of genetic encoded libraries for selection of peptide substrates, even from very low initial starting abundance and under sub&#8208;optimal conditions, and emphasizes the need to consider binding biases of antibodies and both  C  &#8208; and  N  &#8208;terminal tags in profiling peptide substrates by high&#8208;throughput display.</dc:description>

      <title>Zn2+&#8208;dependent DNAzymes: From Solution Chemistry to Analytical, Materials and Therapeutic Applications</title>
      <dc:description>Since 1994, deoxyribozymes or DNAzymes were in vitro selected to catalyze various types of reactions. Metal ions play a critical role in DNAzyme catalysis, and among them Zn2+ is a very important one. Zn2+ has good biocompatibility and can be used for intracellular applications. Chemically, Zn2+ is a strong Lewis acid and it can bind to both the phosphate backbone and the nucleobases of DNA. Zn2+ undergoes hydrolysis even at neutral pH and the partially hydrolyzed polynuclear complexes can affect the interactions with DNA. These features have made Zn2+ a unique cofactor for DNAzyme reactions. This review summarizes Zn2+&#8208;dependent DNAzymes with an emphasis on RNA/DNA&#8208;cleaving reactions. A key feature is the sharp Zn2+ concentration and pH&#8208;dependent activity for many of the DNAzymes. The applications of these DNAzymes as biosensors for Zn2+, as therapeutic agents to cleave intracellular RNA and as chemical biology tools to manipulate DNA are discussed. Future studies can focus on the selection of new DNAzymes with improved performance and detailed biochemical characterizations to understand the role of Zn2+, which can facilitate practical applications of Zn2+&#8208;dependent DNAzymes.</dc:description>

      <title>Identification of&#160;L&#8208;lactate Dehydrogenase&#160;as a&#160;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B&#160;substrate using K&#8208;BIPS</title>
      <dc:description>Kinases and phosphatases are major players in a variety&#160;of cellular events, including cell signaling. Aberrant activity or&#160;mutations in kinases and phosphatases can lead to diseases, such as&#160;cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. Compared to kinases,&#160;phosphatases are understudied, which is partly a result of the limited&#160;methods to identify substrates. As a solution, we developed a&#160;proteomics&#8208;based method called Kinase&#8208;catalyzed Biotinylation to&#160;Identify Phosphatase Substrates (K&#8208;BIPS) that previously identified&#160;substrates of Ser/Thr phosphatases using small molecule inhibitors.&#160;Here, for the first time, K&#8208;BIPS was applied to identify substrates of a&#160;tyrosine phosphatase, Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B),&#160;using siRNA knockdown conditions. Eight possible substrates of&#160;PTP1B were discovered in HEK293 cells, including the known&#160;substrate Pyruvate Kinase. In addition, L&#8208;lactate Dehydrogenase&#160;(LDHA) was validated as a novel PTP1B substrate. With the ability to&#160;use knockdown conditions with Ser/Thr or Tyr phosphatases, K&#8208;BIPS&#160;represents a general discovery tool to explore phosphatases biology&#160;by identifying unanticipated substrates.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Kinases and phosphatases are major players in a variety&#160;of cellular events, including cell signaling. Aberrant activity or&#160;mutations in kinases and phosphatases can lead to diseases, such as&#160;cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. Compared to kinases,&#160;phosphatases are understudied, which is partly a result of the limited&#160;methods to identify substrates. As a solution, we developed a&#160;proteomics&#8208;based method called Kinase&#8208;catalyzed Biotinylation to&#160;Identify Phosphatase Substrates (K&#8208;BIPS) that previously identified&#160;substrates of Ser/Thr phosphatases using small molecule inhibitors.&#160;Here, for the first time, K&#8208;BIPS was applied to identify substrates of a&#160;tyrosine phosphatase, Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B),&#160;using siRNA knockdown conditions. Eight possible substrates of&#160;PTP1B were discovered in HEK293 cells, including the known&#160;substrate Pyruvate Kinase. In addition, L&#8208;lactate Dehydrogenase&#160;(LDHA) was validated as a novel PTP1B substrate. With the ability to&#160;use knockdown conditions with Ser/Thr or Tyr phosphatases, K&#8208;BIPS&#160;represents a general discovery tool to explore phosphatases biology&#160;by identifying unanticipated substrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Engineered TALE Repeats for Enhanced Imaging&#8208;based Analysis

of Cellular 5&#8208;Methylcytosine</title>
      <dc:description>Transcription&#8208;activator&#8208;like effectors (TALEs) are repeat&#8208;based, programmable DNA binding proteins that can be engineered to recognize sequences of canonical and epigenetic nucleobases. Fluorescent TALEs can be utilized for the imaging&#8208;based analysis of cellular 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5mC) in repetitive DNA sequences. This is based on recording fluorescence ratios from cell co&#8208;stains with two TALEs: an analytical TALE targeting the cytosine (C) position of interest via a C&#8208;selective repeat that is blocked by 5mC, and a control TALE targeting the position with a universal repeat that binds both C and 5mC. For an enhancement of this approach, we here report the development of novel 5mC&#8208;selective repeats and their integration into TALEs that can replace universal TALEs in imaging&#8208;based 5mC analysis, resulting in a methylation&#8208;dependent response of both TALEs. We screen a library of size&#8208;reduced repeats and identify several 5mC&#8208;binders. Compared to the 5mC binding repeat of natural TALEs and to the universal repeat, two repeats containing aromatic residues show enhancement of 5mC&#8208;binding and &#8208;selectivity in cellular transcription activation and electromobility shift assays, respectively. In co&#8208;stains of cellular SATIII DNA with a corresponding C&#8208;selective TALE, this selectivity results in positive methylation response of the new TALE, offering perspectives for studying 5mC functions in chromatin regulation by  in situ  imaging with increased dynamic range.</dc:description>

      <title>Binding of SARS&#8211;CoV&#8211;2 to cell receptors: a tale of molecular evolution</title>
      <dc:description>The magnified infectious power of the SARS&#8211;CoV&#8211;2 virus compared to its precursor SARS&#8211;CoV is intimately linked to an enhanced ability in the mutated virus to find available hydrogen bond sites in the host cells.

We pinpoint the specific residue (in the virus) to residue (in the cell) contacts during the initial recognition and binding and show that the virus&#183; &#183; &#183; cell interaction is mainly due to an extensive network of hydrogen bonds and to a large surface of non&#8211;covalent interactions. In addition to the formal quantum characterization of bonding interactions, computation of absorption spectra for the specific virus&#183; &#183; &#183; cell interacting residues yields significant shifts of &#8710;&#955; max = 47 and 66 nm in the wavelength for maximum absorption in the complex with respect to the isolated host and virus, respectively.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemoproteomic profiling of an Ibrutinib analogue reveals its unexpected role in DNA damage repair</title>
      <dc:description>Ibrutinib was an FDA&#8208;approved drug to treat B&#8208;lymphoid malignancies, which mechanistically functions as a covalent inhibitor for Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). During the course of screening more potent and selective BTK inhibitors, we discovered that, MM2&#8208;48, an Ibrutinib analogue which contains the alkynyl amide functional group in place of the acrylamide warhead, exhibits a much stronger cytotoxicity. Comparative chemoproteomic profiling of the targets of Ibrutinib and MM2&#8208;48 revealed that the alkynyl amide warhead exhibits much higher reactivity in proteomes. Unexpectedly, MM2&#8208;48 covalently targets a functional cysteine in BCCIP, a BRCA2 and CDKN1A&#8208;interacting protein, and significantly inhibits DNA damage repair. Our findings suggest that simultaneous inhibition of BTK activity and DNA damage repair might be a more effective therapeutic strategy for combating B&#8208;cell malignancies.</dc:description>

      <title>Oligomers of Cyclic Oligochalcogenides for Enhanced Cellular Uptake</title>
      <dc:description>Monomeric cyclic oligochalcogenides (COCs) are emerging as attractive transporters to deliver substrates of interest into the cytosol through thiol&#8208;mediated uptake . &#160; The objective of this study was to explore COC oligomers. &#160; We report a systematic evaluation of monomers, dimers, and trimers of asparagusic, lipoic, and diselenolipoic acid as well as their supramolecular monomers, dimers, trimers, and tetramers. &#160; COC dimers were more than twice more active than the monomers on the covalent and the non&#8208;covalent level, while COC trimers were not much better than dimers. &#160; These trends might suggest that thiol&#8208;mediated uptake of COCs is synergistic over both short and long distances, i.e., involves more than two COCs and more than one membrane protein, although other interpretations cannot be excluded at this level of complexity. &#160; These results thus provide attractive perspectives for structural evolution as well as imminent use in practice. &#160; Moreover, they validate automated HC&#8208;CAPA as an invaluable method to collect comprehensive data on cytosolic delivery within a reasonable time at a level of confidence that is otherwise inconceivable.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Monomeric cyclic oligochalcogenides (COCs) are emerging as attractive transporters to deliver substrates of interest into the cytosol through thiol&#8208;mediated uptake . &#160; The objective of this study was to explore COC oligomers. &#160; We report a systematic evaluation of monomers, dimers, and trimers of asparagusic, lipoic, and diselenolipoic acid as well as their supramolecular monomers, dimers, trimers, and tetramers. &#160; COC dimers were more than twice more active than the monomers on the covalent and the non&#8208;covalent level, while COC trimers were not much better than dimers. &#160; These trends might suggest that thiol&#8208;mediated uptake of COCs is synergistic over both short and long distances, i.e., involves more than two COCs and more than one membrane protein, although other interpretations cannot be excluded at this level of complexity. &#160; These results thus provide attractive perspectives for structural evolution as well as imminent use in practice. &#160; Moreover, they validate automated HC&#8208;CAPA as an invaluable method to collect comprehensive data on cytosolic delivery within a reasonable time at a level of confidence that is otherwise inconceivable.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Molecular basis of the antiangiogenic action of rosmarinic acid, a natural compound targeting Fibroblast Growth Factor&#8208;2/FGFR interactions</title>
      <dc:description>Fibroblast growth factor (FGF2)/Fibroblast growth factor Receptor (FGFR) signalling plays a major role both in physiology and in several pathologies, including cancer development, metastasis formation and resistance to therapy. The development of small molecules, acting extracellularly to target FGF2/FGFR interactions, has the advantage of limiting adverse effects associated to the current intracellular FGFR inhibitors. Here we discuss the ability of the natural compound rosmarinic acid (RA) to induce FGF2/FGFR complex dissociation. The molecular level description of FGF2/FGFR/RA system, by NMR and docking, clearly demonstrates that RA binds to FGFR&#8208;D2 domain and directly competes with FGF2 for the same binding site. Both direct and allosteric perturbations concur to destabilize the complex. The proposed molecular mechanism is validated by cellular studies showing that RA inhibits FGF2&#8208;induced endothelial cells proliferation and FGFR activation. Our results can serve as the basis for the development of new extracellular inhibitors of the FGF/FGFR pathways.</dc:description>

      <title>Characterization of apo&#8208;form selective inhibition of indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase.</title>
      <dc:description>Indoleamine&#8208;2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a heme&#8208;containing enzyme that catalyzes the rate&#8208;limiting step in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan (TRP) metabolism. As an inflammation&#8208;induced immunoregulatory enzyme, pharmacological inhibition of IDO1 activity is currently being pursued as a potential therapeutic tool for the treatment of cancer and other disease states. As such, a detailed understanding of the mechanism of action of established and novel IDO1 inhibitors remains of great interest. Comparison of a newly&#8208;developed IDO1 inhibitor (GSK5628) to the existing best&#8208;in&#8208;class compound, epacadostat (Incyte), allows us to report on a unique inhibition mechanism for IDO1. Here, we demonstrate that GSK5628 inhibits IDO1 by competing with heme for binding to a heme&#8208;free conformation of the enzyme (apo&#8208;IDO1) while epacadostat coordinates its binding with the iron atom of the IDO1 heme cofactor. Comparison of these two compounds in cellular systems reveals a long&#8208;lasting inhibitory effect of GSK5628, undescribed for other known IDO1 inhibitors. Detailed characterization of this apo&#8208;binding mechanism for IDO1 inhibition may help design superior inhibitors or may confer a unique competitive advantage over other IDO1 inhibitors vis&#8208;&#225;&#8208;vis specificity and pharmacokinetic parameters.</dc:description>

      <title>Activation of Protease and Luciferase Using Engineered Nostoc Punctiforme PCC73102 DnaE Intein with Altered Split Position</title>
      <dc:description>Inteins, a self&#8208;catalytic enzyme, have been widely used in the field of protein engineering and chemical biology. Here,  Nostoc punctiforme  PCC73102 (  Npu  ) DnaE intein was engineered to have an altered split position. An eleven residue N&#8208;intein of DnaE in which Gly and Asp were substituted for Tyr and Glu at positions 4 and 5, respectively, was designed, and the active C&#8208;intein variants were acquired by a GFP fluorescence&#8208;based screening. The designed N&#8208;intein and the obtained active C&#8208;intein variants were used to construct a turn&#8208;on system for the enzyme activities such as human immunodeficiency 1 protease and NanoLuc luciferase. Based on the NanoLuc&#8208;intein fusion, we developed two intein pairs, each of which is capable of reacting preferentially, by interchanging the charged amino acids upon N&#8208; and C&#8208;inteins. The specific splicing reactions were easily monitored and discriminated by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) technique.</dc:description>

      <title>Fc&#8208;binding antibody&#8208;recruiting molecules targeting prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen:&#160;defucosylation of antibody for efficacy improvement</title>
      <dc:description>Synthetic small molecules that redirect endogenous antibodies to target cells are promising drug candidates because they overcome the potential shortcomings of therapeutic antibodies, such as immunogenicity&#160;and the need for intravenous delivery. Previously, we reported a novel class of bispecific molecules targeting the antibody Fc region and folate receptor, named Fc&#8208;binding antibody&#8208;recruiting molecules (Fc&#8208;ARMs). Fc&#8208;ARMs can theoretically recruit most endogenous antibodies, inducing cancer cell elimination via antibody&#8208;dependent cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Here, we describe new Fc&#8208;ARMs that target prostate cancer (Fc&#8208;ARM&#8208;Ps). Fc&#8208;ARM&#8208;Ps recruited antibodies to cancer cells expressing&#160;prostate&#8208;specific membraneantigen but did so with lower efficiency compared with Fc&#8208;ARMs targeting folate receptor. Upon recruitment by Fc&#8208;ARM&#8208;P, defucosylated antibodies efficiently activated natural killer cells and induced ADCC, whereas antibodies with intact N&#8208;glycans did not. The results suggest that the affinity between recruited antibodies and CD16a, a type of Fc receptor expressed on immune cells, could be a key factor controlling immune activation in the Fc&#8208;ARM strategy.</dc:description>

      <title>&#945;&#8208;Methylene&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactone scaffold for developing chemical probes at the two ends of the selectivity spectrum</title>
      <dc:description>The utilities of an &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactone (MeLac) moiety as a warhead composed of multiple electrophilic sites are reported. We demonstrate that a MeLac&#8208;alkyne not only reacts with diverse proteins as a broadly reactive measurement probe but also recruits endogenous reduced glutathione (GSH) to assemble a selective chemical probe of GSH&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactone (GSH&#8208;Lac)&#8208;alkyne in live cells. Tandem mass spectrometry reveals that MeLac reacts with nucleophilic cysteine, serine, lysine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, through either Michael addition or acyl addition. A peptide&#8208;centric proteomics platform demonstrates that the proteomic selectivity profiles of orlistat and parthenolide, which have distinct reactivities, are measurable by MeLac&#8208;alkyne as a high&#8208;coverage&#160;probe. The GSH&#8208;Lac&#8208;alkyne selectively probes the glutathione S&#8208;transferase P responsible for multidrug resistance. The assembly of the GSH&#8208;Lac probe exemplifies a modular and scalable route to develop selective probes with different recognizing moieties.</dc:description>

A peptide&#8208;centric proteomics platform demonstrates that the proteomic selectivity profiles of orlistat and parthenolide, which have distinct reactivities, are measurable by MeLac&#8208;alkyne as a high&#8208;coverage&#160;probe. The GSH&#8208;Lac&#8208;alkyne selectively probes the glutathione S&#8208;transferase P responsible for multidrug resistance. The assembly of the GSH&#8208;Lac probe exemplifies a modular and scalable route to develop selective probes with different recognizing moieties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Comparison of Bioorthogonal &#946;&#8208;Lactone Activity&#8208;Based Probes for Selective Labeling of Penicillin&#8208;Binding Proteins</title>
      <dc:description>Penicillin&#8208;binding proteins (PBPs) are a family of bacterial enzymes that are key components of cell wall biosynthesis and the target of &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics. Most microbial pathogens contain multiple structurally homologous PBP isoforms, making it difficult to target individual PBPs. To study the roles and regulation of specific PBP isoforms, a panel of bioorthogonal &#946;&#8208;lactone probes was synthesized and compared. Fluorescent labeling confirmed selectivity, and PBPs were selectively enriched from  Streptococcus pneumoniae  lysates. Comparisons between fluorescent labeling of probes revealed that the accessibility of bioorthogonal reporter molecules to the bound probe in the native protein environment exerts a more significant effect on labeling intensity than the bioorthogonal reaction used, observations which are likely applicable beyond this class of probes or proteins. Selective, bioorthogonal activity&#8208;based probes for PBPs will facilitate the activity&#8208;based determination of the roles and regulation of specific PBP isoforms, a key gap in knowledge which has yet to be filled.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthetic Antibody Mimics Based on Cancer&#8208;Targeting Immunostimulatory Peptides</title>
      <dc:description>De novo cancer&#8208;targeting immunostimulatory peptides have been designed and developed as synthetic antibody mimics.&#160; A selected trimeric peptide displayed binding on GRP78  +  HepG2 and A549 target cells with some degree of GRP78&#8208;binding dependence.

In co&#8208;culture, fluorescence microscopy revealed that the target GFP&#8208;expressing A549 cells were visibly associated to the effector NK cells when pre&#8208;activated with lead trimeric peptide. Accordingly, A549 cells were found to be compromised as evidenced by the loss of GFP signal and notable detection of early/late stage apoptosis.

      <dc:description>Photoactivatable fluorophores are emerging optical probes for biological applications. Most photoactivatable fluorophores are relatively large in size and need to be activated using ultraviolet light, dramatically limiting their applications. To introduce photoactivatable fluorophores into proteins, recent investigations have explored several protein labeling technologies, including fluorescein arsenical hairpin (FlAsH) Tag, HaloTag labeling, SNAPTag labeling, and bioorthogonal conjugation.

      <title>Bioorthogonal reactions in animals</title>
      <dc:description>The advent of bioorthogonal chemistry has led to the development of powerful chemical tools enabling increasingly ambitious applications. In particular, these tools have made possible to achieve what is considered as the holy grail of many researchers involved in chemical biology: to perform non&#8208;natural chemical reactions within living organisms. In this minireview, we present an update of bioorthogonal reactions that have been carried out in animals for various applications. We outline the advances made in the understanding of fundamental biological processes and the development of innovative imaging and therapeutic strategies using bioorthogonal chemistry.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The advent of bioorthogonal chemistry has led to the development of powerful chemical tools enabling increasingly ambitious applications. In particular, these tools have made possible to achieve what is considered as the holy grail of many researchers involved in chemical biology: to perform non&#8208;natural chemical reactions within living organisms. In this minireview, we present an update of bioorthogonal reactions that have been carried out in animals for various applications. We outline the advances made in the understanding of fundamental biological processes and the development of innovative imaging and therapeutic strategies using bioorthogonal chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Chemical Proteomics for Expanding the Druggability of Human Disease</title>
      <dc:description>
Interacting with interactions: Chemical proteomics has taken shape as a powerful technique that seeks to understand small&#8208;molecule and protein function in the physiological system. Chemical proteomics that integrates activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) technology with mass spectrometry has been introduced to evaluate small&#8208;molecule and protein interaction and expand the druggable proteome.







Abstract
Abstract. Over the past decade, chemical proteomics has emerged as a powerful technique to understand small molecule and protein function in the physiological system and plays a key role in unravelling the cellular targets of pharmacological modulators. Chemical proteomics that integrates activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) with mass spectrometry has been introduced to evaluate small&#8208;molecule and protein interaction and expand the druggable proteome. A much larger fraction of the human proteome can now be targeted by small molecules than estimated by past predictions of protein druggability.

      <title>Surface Ligand&#8208;Density Switches Glycovesicles Between Monomeric and Multimeric Lectin Recognitions</title>
      <dc:description>Carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions define multitude of cellular recognition events. We present herein synthetic glycovesicles as cell surface mimics in order to switch the nature of the lectin recognitions. The covalent glycovesicles, constituted with diacetylene monomers of varying ligand densities at their surfaces, are prepared through photo&#8208;polymerization. Vesicles imbedded with sparsely populated ligands engage a lectin interaction, leading to a dense cross&#8208;linked multimeric complex formation. Whereas vesicles having the most or complete ligand constitution switch the lectin interaction to form a fully soluble monomeric complex, without a cross&#8208;linking. Nanomolar dissociation constants govern these interactions, as assessed by a ligand displacement assay. The study demonstrates the switching between monomeric and multimeric nature of the interaction as a function of ligand densities in the vesicles and the results are directly relevant to understand such a phenomenon occurring at the cell surfaces.</dc:description>

      <title>Characterization of a Mo&#8208;nitrogenase variant containing a citrate&#8208;substituted cofactor</title>
      <dc:description>Nitrogenase converts N  2  to NH  3  , and CO to hydrocarbons, at its cofactor site. Here, we report a biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of a Mo&#8208;nitrogenase variant expressed in an  Azotobacter vinelandii  strain containing a deletion of  nifV  , the gene encoding the homocitrate synthase. Designated NifDK  Cit  , the catalytic component of this Mo&#8208;nitrogenase variant contains a citrate&#8208;substituted cofactor analog. Activity analysis of NifDK  Cit  reveals a shift of CO&#8208;reduction from H  2  &#8208;evolution toward hydrocarbon&#8208;formation and an opposite shift of N  2  &#8208;reduction from NH  3  &#8208;formation toward H  2  &#8208;evolution. Consistent with a shift in the Mo K&#8208;edge energy of NifDK  Cit  relative to that of its wildtype counterpart, EPR analysis demonstrates a broadening of the line&#8208;shape and a decrease in the intensity of the cofactor&#8208;originated  S  = 3/2 signal, suggesting a change in the spin properties of the cofactor upon citrate substitution. These observations point to a crucial role of homocitrate in substrate reduction by nitrogenase and the possibility to tune product profiles of nitrogenase reactions via organic ligand substitution.</dc:description>

      <title>Simultaneous Visualization of Wet Cells and Nanostructured Biomaterials in SEM using Ionic Liquids</title>
      <dc:description>This work presents a successful methodology to image mammalian cells adhered to nanostructured titanium using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) operating in low&#8208;vacuum mode following ionic liquid treatment. Human osteoblast&#8208;like Saos&#8208;2 cells were treated with a room&#8208;temperature ionic liquid, 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, and subsequently imaged on titanium utilizing SEM. Titanium substrates were modified to create laser&#8208;induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) for visualizing at the sub&#8208;micron scale. Using a combination of fluorescence&#8208;based cell metabolism along with light microscopy and SEM image analysis, the shape and location of irradiated cells were confirmed to be unchanged after multiple irradiation sessions while the viability of minimally irradiated cells was unaltered. The wet imaging conditions combined with a rapid facile protocol using ionic liquid allows this technique to fulfill a niche in examining cellular behavior on biomaterials with sub&#8208;micron surface features. The demonstrated method to track observed cell adhesion to sub&#8208;micron surface features with SEM has great implications for the understanding of cell migration on nanostructured surfaces as well as on the exploration of simpler SEM preparation methods for cellular imaging.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
Metals in medicine: Metal complexes offer unique properties in comparison to organic drugs. Herein, the generally underestimated potential of metal&#8208;containing compounds in comparison to organic compounds, as exemplified by photodynamic therapy, is highlighted.







Abstract
The vast majority of investigated compounds in modern medicine are based on organic molecules. Within the last decades, the field of medicinial chemistry is shifting towards the application of metal complexes. These compounds offer different mechanisms of action in comparison to organic molecules due to their unique properties, making them novel drug candidates. Herein, the successful combination of metal containing compounds and medicine is highlighted by their application for photodynamic therapy.

      <title>Pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid probes capable of cross&#8208;linking with DNA: Effects of terminal and internal modifications on cross&#8208;link efficiency</title>
      <dc:description>In this study, we describe a furan&#8208;modified acpcPNA as a probe that can form an interstrand cross&#8208;link (ICL) with its DNA target upon activation with N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS). To overcome the problem of the furan instability under acidic conditions, a simple and versatile post&#8208;synthetic methodology for the attachment of the furan group to the PNA probe is developed. Unlike other designs, the furan was placed at the end of the PNA molecule or tethered to the PNA backbone with all the base pairs in the PNA&#8208;DNA duplexes fully preserved. Hence, the true reactivity of each nucleobase towards the cross&#8208;linking could be compared. We show that all DNA bases except T could participate in the cross&#8208;linking reaction when the furan was placed at the end of the PNA strand. The cross&#8208;linking process was sensitive to mispairing, and lower cross&#8208;linking efficiency was observed in the presence of a base&#8208;mismatch in the PNA&#8208;DNA duplex. In contrast, when the furan was placed at the internal positions of the acpcPNA&#8208;DNA duplex, no ICL was observed which was explained by the inability of a hydrogen&#8208;bonded nucleobase to participate in the cross&#8208;linking reaction. The cross&#8208;linking efficiency was considerably improved, despite lower duplex stability, when an unpaired base (in the form of C&#8208;insertion) was present in the complementary DNA strand close to the furan modification site.</dc:description>

      <title>Discovery of the 2,4&#8242;&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;3&#8242;&#8208;methoxypropiophenone biosynthesis genes in Aspergillus oryzae</title>
      <dc:description>The filamentous fungus  Aspergillus oryzae  has 27 putative iterative type I polyketide synthase (PKS) gene clusters, but secondary metabolites produced by them are mostly unknown. Here, we focused on eight clusters which were reported to be expressed at relatively high levels in a transcriptome analysis. By comparison of metabolites between an octuple&#8208;deletion mutant of these eight PKS gene clusters and its parent strain, we found that  A. oryzae  produced 2,4&#8242;&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;3&#8242;&#8208;methoxypropiophenone (  1  ) and its precursor, 4&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8242;&#8208;methoxypropiophenone (  3  ), in a specific liquid medium. Furthermore, an iterative type I PKS (PpsB) encoded by AO090102000166 and an acetyl&#8208;CoA ligase (PpsA) encoded downstream from  ppsB  were shown to be essential for their biosynthesis. PpsC, encoded upstream from  ppsB  , was shown to have  3  &#8208;binding activity (  K  d  ; 26.0 &#177; 6.2 &#956;M) and is suggested to be involved in the conversion of  3  to  1  . This study deepens our understanding of cryptic secondary metabolism in  A. oryzae  .</dc:description>

      <title>Short RNA Universal Coding for Topological Transformation Nanobarcoding Application</title>
      <dc:description>With the advent of innovative genomic discovery toolkits such as RT&#8208;PCR, genetic information can be quickly decrypted, which has resulted in significant progress in overcoming diseases. However, RT&#8208;PCR has the serious problem of frequent errors, and the demand for a new gene diagnostic system is emerging.

      <title>Structural cues for understanding eEF1A2 moonlighting</title>
      <dc:description>Spontaneous mutations in the  EEF1A2  gene cause epilepsy and severe neurological disabilities in children.

      <title>A pyrimido&#8208;quinoxaline fused heterocycle lights up transfer RNA upon binding at the Mg2+ binding site</title>
      <dc:description>Transfer RNAs (tRNA) are fundamental molecules in cellular translation. In the present study we have highlighted a fluorescence&#8208;based perceptive approach for tRNA using quinoxaline small molecule. We have synthesized a water soluble fluorescent pyrimido&#8208;quinoxaline fused heterocycle containing a mandatory piperazine tail (  DS1  ) with a large stokes shift (~ 160 nm). The interaction between  DS1  and tRNA results in significant fluorescence enhancement of the molecule with a K  d  ~ 5 &#181;M and multiple binding sites. Our work reveals that  DS1  binding site overlaps with the specific Mg  2+  ion binding site in the D loop of tRNA. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the molecule inhibited Pb  2+  induced cleavage of yeast tRNA  Phe  in the D loop. In competitive binding assay, the fluorescence of DS1&#8208;tRNA complex is quenched by a known tRNA&#8208;binder, tobramycin. This indicates the displacement of  DS1  and indeed a substantiation of a specific binding at the site of tertiary interaction in the central region of tRNA. The ability of compound  DS1  to bind tRNA with higher affinity compared to DNA and single&#8208;stranded RNA offers a promising approach in developing tRNA based biomarker diagnostics in future.</dc:description>

This indicates the displacement of  DS1  and indeed a substantiation of a specific binding at the site of tertiary interaction in the central region of tRNA. The ability of compound  DS1  to bind tRNA with higher affinity compared to DNA and single&#8208;stranded RNA offers a promising approach in developing tRNA based biomarker diagnostics in future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Realizing the promise of precision medicine will require breaking down communication barriers between genomic, screening and literature &#8220;big data.&#8221; We discuss the opportunities and challenges of reconciling data science approaches with the scientific method and the critical role of chemical biologists as a bridge between data and mechanism. Finally we propose next steps on the road to precision medicine and give examples of new tools designed to catalyze these steps.

      <title>4&#8208;Thiouridine Enhanced Peroxidase&#8208;generated Biotinylation of RNA</title>
      <dc:description>Peroxidase&#8208;generated proximity labeling has been widespread used to study the subcellular proteomes and protein interaction networks in living cells, but the development for study of subcellular RNA are limited. APEX&#8208;seq has emerged as a new method to study the subcellular RNA in living cells, but the labeling of RNA still have space to improve. In this work, we describe 4&#8208;thiouridine (s4U) enhanced peroxidase&#8208;generated biotinylation of RNA with high efficiency. The incorporation of s4U could introduce additional sites for RNA labeling, the enhanced biotinylation were observed on monomer, model oligo RNA and total RNA. Through s4U metabolic approach, the in vivo RNA biotinylation efficiency by peroxidase catalysis was also dramatically increased, which will benefit the RNA isolation and the study for spatial transcriptome.</dc:description>
