         <title>Versatile and efficient protein association through chemically modified Sphingomyelin Nanosystems (SNs) for enhanced delivery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteins are biological macromolecules well known to regulate many cellular signaling mechanisms. For instance, they are very appealing for their application as therapeutic agents, presenting high specificity and activity. Nonetheless, they suffer from unfolding, instability and low bioavailability making their administration through systemic and other routes very tough. To overcome these drawbacks, drug delivery systems and nanotechnology have arisen to deliver biomolecules in a sustained manner while, at the same time, increasing dose availability, protecting the cargo without compromising proteins' bioactivity, and enhancing intracellular delivery. In this work, we proposed the optimization of sphingomyelin nanosystems (SNs) for the delivery of a wide collection of proteins (ranging from 10&#8208;500 kDa and pI) using diverse chemical association strategies. We have further characterized SNs by varied analytical methodologies. We have also carried out in vitro experiments to validate the potential of the developed formulations. As the final goal, we aim to obtain evidence of the potential use of SNs for the development of protein therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Substituted Acyclic and Cyclic N&#8208;Alkylhydrazines by Enzymatic Reductive Hydrazinations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imine reductases (IREDs) provide promising opportunities for the synthesis of various chiral amines. Initially, asymmetric imine reduction was reported, followed by reductive aminations of aldehydes and ketones via imines. Herein we present the reductive amination of structurally diverse carbonyls and dicarbonyls with hydrazines (reductive hydrazination), catalyzed by the IRED from Myxococcus stipitatus. In analogy to IRED&#8208;catalyzed reductive aminations, various carbonyls and dicarbonyls could react with simple hydrazines to produce substituted acyclic and cyclic N&#8208;alkylhydrazines. By incorporating and scaling up hydrogenase cofactor regeneration system, we demonstrated the scalability and atom&#8208;efficiency of an H2&#8208;driven double reductive hydrazination, highlightling the potential of IREDs in biocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>High Content Screening Assay of Inhibitors of the Legionella&#160;pneumophila Histone Methyltransferase RomA in Infected Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Resistance to anti&#8208;microbial agents is a world&#8208;wide health threat. Thus there is an urgent need for new treatments. An alternative approach to disarm pathogens consists in developing drugs targeting epigenetic modifiers. Bacterial pathogens can manipulate epigenetic regulatory systems of the host to bypass defences to proliferate and survive. One example is Legionella pneumophila, a Gram&#8208;negative intracellular pathogen that targets host chromatin with a specific, secreted bacterial SET&#8208;domain methyltransferase named RomA. This histone methyltransferase specifically methylates H3K14 during infection and is responsible for changing the host epigenetic landscape upon L. pneumophila infection. To inhibit RomA activity during infection, we developed a reliable high&#8208;content imaging screening assay, which we used to screen an in&#8208;house chemical library developed to inhibit DNA and histone methyltransferases. This assay was optimised using monocytic leukemic THP&#8208;1 cells differentiated into macrophages infected with L. pneumophila in a 96&#8208; or 384&#8208;well plate format using the Opera Phenix&#174; (Perkin Elmer) confocal microscope, combined with Columbus&#8482; software for automated image acquisition and analysis. H3K14 methylation was followed in infected, single cells and cytotoxicity was assessed in parallel. A first pilot screening of 477 compounds identified a potential starting point for inhibitors of H3K14 methylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances of Light/Hypoxia&#8208;Responsive Azobenzene in Nanomedicine Design</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azobenzene (Azo) and its derivatives are versatile stimuli&#8208;responsive molecules. Their reversible photoisomerization and susceptibility to reduction&#8208;mediated cleavage make them valuable for various biomedical applications. Upon exposure to the UV light, Azo units undergo a thermodynamically stable trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis transition, which can be reversed by heating in the dark or irradiation with visible light. Additionally, the N=N bonds in azobenzenes can be cleaved under hypoxic conditions by azoreductase, making azobenzenes useful as hypoxia&#8208;responsive linkers. The integration of azobenzenes into nanomedicines holds promise for enhancing therapeutic efficacy, particularly in tumor targeting and controllable drug release. In this Concept paper, recent advances in the design and applications of azobenzene&#8208;based nanomedicines are updated, and future development opportunities are also summarized.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering of a Malonyl&#8208;CoA Ligase for Production of Fluorinated Polyketide Extender Units</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally diverse malonyl&#8208;CoA building blocks are required to regioselectively diversify macrolide compounds. Specifically, fluorinated building blocks represent pathways to introduce fluorine into drug&#8208;like compounds. Herein, the biosynthesis of a tertiary fluorinated malonyl&#8208;CoA is described via mutagenesis of the malonyl&#8208;CoA ligase, MatB, from Rhodopseudomonas palustris. Mutation provided a variant with a shifted product profile, providing a mutant relevant for macrolide biosynthesis.







Abstract
Enzymatic platforms for producing malonyl&#8208;CoA&#8208;based extender units required for polyketide biosynthesis are often based on malonyl&#8208;CoA ligases such as MatB from Rhizobium trifolii and Rhodopseudomonas palustris. However, despite broad interest in the fluorination of polyketides and prior success with engineering MatB homologs, the suitability of MatB for accessing the tertiary substituted fluoromethylmalonyl&#8208;CoA needed to produce flurithromycin and solithromycin has not yet been reported. Herein, we report the structure&#8208;guided engineering of a MatB homolog to optimize the production of fluoromethylmalonyl&#8208;CoA, resulting in a variant with increased conversion and providing a platform to produce a suitable building block mixture for fluorinated macrolide production. Additionally, the mutant demonstrated broad utility for various substituted malonyl&#8208;CoAs. The MatB mutant sets the stage to access fluorinated macrolides by coupling it with altered PKS machinery to install fluorinated malonyl&#8208;CoA into macrolide scaffolds.

         <title>Research Progress of Cyanine&#8208;Based Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent Probes for Biological Application</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an analysis of cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent probes for biological application. The topic includes explaining what is cyanine dyes and why can these dyes be used for design of fluorescent probes for biological application. The typical cyanines&#8208;based NIR fluorescent probes, focusing on their utilities in fluorescence imaging, PTT and PDT, are critically discussed.







Abstract
Cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent probes have played vital roles in biological application due to their low interference from background fluorescence, deep tissue penetration, high sensitivity, and minimal photodamage to biological samples. They are widely utilized in molecular recognition, medical diagnosis, biomolecular detection, and biological imaging. Herein, we provide a review of recent advancements in cyanine&#8208;based NIR fluorescent probes for the detection of pH, cells, tumor as well as their application in photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT).

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Modification of Daptomycin: Aromatic Group Installation on Trp1</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aromatic prenyltransferase CdpNPT can modify Trp1 of daptomycin using various alkyl&#8208;pyrophosphate analogs. This study evaluated CdpNPT's ability to generate daptomycin analogs with 21 different benzylic and heterocyclic alkyl&#8208;PP analogs. All six structurally characterized Trp1&#8208;substituted daptomycin analogs demonstrated potent activity against DapS and DapR Gram&#8208;positive bacterial strains.







Abstract
Daptomycin is a cyclic lipodepsipeptide antibiotic used to treat infections caused by Gram&#8208;positive pathogens, including multi&#8208;drug resistant strains such as methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin&#8208;resistant enterococci (VRE). The emergence of daptomycin&#8208;resistant bacterial strains has renewed interest in generating daptomycin analogs. Previous studies have shown that replacing the tryptophan of daptomycin with aromatic groups can generate analogs with enhanced potency. Additionally, we have demonstrated that aromatic prenyltransferases can attach diverse groups to the tryptophan of daptomycin. Here, we report the use of the prenyltransferase CdpNPT to derivatize the tryptophan of daptomycin with a library of benzylic and heterocyclic pyrophosphates. An analytical&#8208;scale study revealed that CdpNPT can transfer various aromatic groups onto daptomycin. Subsequent scaled&#8208;up and purified reactions indicated that the enzyme can attach aromatic groups to N1, C2, C5 and C6 positions of Trp1 of daptomycin. In vitro antibacterial activity assays using six of these purified compounds identified aromatic substituted daptomycin analogs show potency against both daptomycin&#8208;susceptible and resistant strains of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. These findings suggest that installing aromatic groups on the Trp1 of daptomycin can lead to the generation of potent daptomycin analogs.

         <title>Selective Dissolution of Calcium Pyrophosphate Dihydrate Crystals Using a Pyrophosphate Specific Receptor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Joint deposits of insoluble calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals (CPPD) cause pseudo&#8208;gout, a type of arthritis. CPPD's insolubility is driven by electrostatic interaction of di&#8208;cationic calcium ions with tetra&#8208;anionic pyrophosphate ions. This interaction can be effectively disrupted through the use of a molecule (PPS&#8208;1) that presents surrogate di&#8208;cations in a spatially ordered array. Using PPS&#8208;1 we were able to dissolve CPPD selectively over the closely related mineral hydroxy apatite.







Abstract
Pseudo&#8208;gout is caused by the deposition of highly insoluble calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals in the joints of sufferers. This leads to inflammation and ultimately joint damage. The insolubility of CPPD is driven by the strong attraction of di&#8208;cationic calcium ions with tetra&#8208;anionic pyrophosphate ions. One of the challenges of dissolving CPPD is that a related mineral, hydroxy apatite (HA) is present in larger amounts in the form of bone and also contains strongly interacting calcium and phosphate ions. Our aim in this work was to selectively dissolve CPPD in preference to HA. To accomplish this, we used a known receptor for pyrophosphate that contains two complexed zinc ions that are ideally spaced to interact with the tetra&#8208;anion of pyrophosphate. We hypothesized that such a molecule could act as a preorganized tetra&#8208;cation that would be able to outcompete the two calcium ions present in the crystal lattice of CPPD. We demonstrate both visually and through analysis of released phosphorous that this molecule is able to preferentially dissolve CPPD over the closely related HA and thus can form the basis for a possible approach for the treatment of pseudo&#8208;gout.

&lt;p&gt;Joint deposits of insoluble calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals (CPPD) cause pseudo-gout, a type of arthritis. CPPD's insolubility is driven by electrostatic interaction of di-cationic calcium ions with tetra-anionic pyrophosphate ions. This interaction can be effectively disrupted through the use of a molecule (PPS-1) that presents surrogate di-cations in a spatially ordered array. Using PPS-1 we were able to dissolve CPPD selectively over the closely related mineral hydroxy apatite.

         <title>Enhancing cellular and enzymatic properties through in vivo continuous evolution</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Directed evolution seeks to evolve target genes at a rate far exceeding the natural mutation rate, thereby endowing cellular and enzymatic properties with desired traits. In vivo continuous directed evolution achieves these purposes by generating libraries within living cells, enabling a continuous cycle of mutant generation and selection, enhancing the exploration of gene variants. Continuous evolution has become powerful tools for unraveling evolution mechanism and improving cellular and enzymatic properties. This review categorizes current continuous evolution into three distinct classes: non&#8208;targeted chromosomal, targeted chromosomal, and extra&#8208;chromosomal hypermutation approaches. It also compares various continuous evolution strategies based on different principles, providing a reference for selecting suitable methods for specific evolutionary goals. Furthermore, this review discusses the two primary limitations for further widespread application of in vivo continuous evolution, which are lack of general applicability and insufficient mutagenic capability. We envision that developing generally applicable mutagenic components and methods to enhance mutation rates for in vivo continuous evolution are promising future directions for wide range applications of continuous evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>The Mysterious World of Non&#8208;canonical Caps &#8211; What We Know and Why We Need New Sequencing Techniques</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It was long believed that viral and eukaryotic mRNA molecules are capped at their 5&#8242; end solely by the N7&#8208;methylguanosine cap, which regulates various aspects of the RNA life cycle, from its biogenesis to its decay. However, the recent discovery of a variety of non&#8208;canonical RNA caps derived from metabolites and cofactors &#8212; such as NAD, FAD, CoA, UDP&#8208;glucose, UDP&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine, and dinucleoside polyphosphates &#8212; has expanded the known repertoire of RNA modifications. These non&#8208;canonical caps are found across all domains of life and can impact multiple aspects of RNA metabolism, including stability, translation initiation, and cellular stress responses. The study of these modifications has been facilitated by sophisticated methodologies such as liquid chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry, which have unveiled their presence in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. The identification of these novel RNA caps highlights the need for advanced sequencing techniques to characterize the specific RNA types bearing these modifications and understand their roles in cellular processes. Unravelling the biological role of non&#8208;canonical RNA caps will provide insights into their contributions to gene expression, cellular adaptation, and evolutionary diversity. This review emphasizes the importance of these technological advancements in uncovering the complete spectrum of RNA modifications and their implications for living systems.</dc:description>

         <title>HPPE Activates NRF2 Signaling by Liberating Heavy Metal Stores</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Cap&#8217;n&#8217;collar transcription factor BACH1 represses the transcription of gene products involved in oxidative stress protection. Accordingly, agents capable of inhibiting the activity of BACH1 would be of keen interest in treating several autoimmune and age&#8208;related diseases. Here, we report that a previously annotated BACH1 inhibitor, HPPE, does not inhibit BACH1 but instead activates a NRF2 driven transcription program that is dependent on the canonical cysteine sensors of NRF2 inhibitory protein KEAP1. Mechanistically, HPPE acts as an ionophore, liberating cellular Zn2+ stores and inducing non&#8208;lethal levels of reactive oxygen species, resulting in KEAP1 inactivation. These data provide a surprising mechanism by which HPPE acts in cells and suggest that inducing small amounts of cellular stress may be a viable mechanism for activating NRF2 therapeutically.</dc:description>

         <title>Recombinant production of the cyclotide kalata B1 by conditional split inteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study describes the design, production, and characterization of a novel conditional intein system for the recombinant production of cyclic peptides. The system is based on two key features: (1) a promiscuous extein recognition site allowing cyclization of virtually any peptide, and (2) a secondary split site within the intein itself enabling triggered splicing at will. Two intein precursors were recombinantly expressed, purified, and then self&#8208;assembled in vitro to cyclize the model peptide kalata B1 (kB1). Cyclized kB1 was successfully purified, refolded and characterized by mass spectrometry and NMR, demonstrating correct disulfide bond formation and identical structure to synthetic kB1. Importantly, the intein&#8208;derived kB1 retained full biological activity as evidenced by insect cell toxicity assays. This work establishes a versatile and efficient approach for intein&#8208;mediated protein cyclization with potential applications in bioengineering and peptide discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequence&#8208;Dependent Acylation of Peptide Lysine Residues by DNAzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methods for modifying intact peptides are useful but can be unselective with regard to amino acid position and sequence context. In this work, we used in vitro selection to identify DNAzymes that acylate a Lys residue of a short peptide in sequence&#8208;dependent fashion. The DNAzymes do not acylate Lys when placed at other residues in the peptide, and the acylation activity depends on the Lys sequence context. A good acylation yield is observed on the preparative nanomole scale. These findings are promising for further development of DNAzymes for broader application to top&#8208;down Lys acylation of peptide and protein substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of Lacto&#8208;N&#8208;biosidases and a Novel N&#8208;Acetyllactosaminidase Activity in the CAZy Family GH20: Functional Diversity and Structural Insights</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The glycoside hydrolase family 20 (GH20) predominantly features N&#8208;acetylhexosaminidases (EC 3.2.1.52), with only few known lacto&#8208;N&#8208;biosidases (EC 3.2.1.140; LNBases). LNBases catalyze the degradation of lacto&#8208;N&#8208;tetraose (LNT), a prominent component of human milk oligosaccharides, thereby supporting a healthy infant gut microbiome development. We investigated GH20 diversity to discover novel enzymes that release disaccharides such as lacto&#8208;N&#8208;biose (LNB). Our approach combined peptide clustering, sequence analysis, and 3D structure model evaluation to assess active site topologies, focusing on the presence of a subsite &#8208;2. Five LNBases were active on pNP&#8208;LNB and four showed activity on LNT. One enzyme displayed activity on both pNP&#8208;LacNAc and pNP&#8208;LNB, establishing the first report of N&#8208;acetyllactosaminidase (LacNAcase) activity. Exploration of this enzyme cluster led to the identification of four additional enzymes sharing this dual substrate specificity. Comparing the determined crystal structure of a specific LNBase (TrpyGH20) and the first crystal structure of an enzyme with dual LacNAcase/LNBase activity (TrdeGH20) revealed a highly conserved subsite &#8208;1, common to GH20 enzymes, while the &#8208;2 subsites varied significantly. TrdeGH20 had a wider subsite &#8208;2, accommodating Gal with both &#946;1,4&#8208; and &#946;1,3&#8208;linkages to the GlcNAc in subsite &#8208;1. Biotechnological applications of these enzymes may include structural elucidation of complex carbohydrates and glycoengineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling Clinical Glycoproteome by Integrating Affinity Enrichment with Nanopore Sequencing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective enlightens the use of enrichment techniques like lectin affinity, boronate affinity, hydrazide chemistry, and molecularly imprinted polymers before nanopore detection to advance clinical glycoproteomics. These methods selectively isolate glycoproteins, removing abundant background proteins. Nanopore technology provides label&#8208;free, real&#8208;time analysis, ensuring optimal sensor function. This combined strategy promises advances in glycosylation research, biomarker discovery, and personalized therapy.







Abstract
This prospect explores the integration of enrichment strategies with nanopore detection to advance clinical glycoproteomics. Glycoproteins, crucial for understanding biological processes, pose challenges due to their low abundance and structural diversity. Enrichment techniques using lectin affinity, boronate affinity, and hydrazide chemistry and especially molecular imprinted polymers may selectively and specifically isolate glycoproteins from complex samples, while nanopore technology enables label&#8208;free, real&#8208;time, and single&#8208;molecule analysis. This approach holds promise for disease&#8208;related glycosylation studies, biomarker discovery, personalized medicine, and streamlined clinical analysis. Standardization, optimization, and data analysis remain challenges, requiring interdisciplinary collaborations and technological advancements. Overall, this integration may offer transformative potential for clinical glycoproteomics and innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

         <title>Regioselective Deacetylation in Nucleosides and Derivatives</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective deprotection of the acetyl group(s) in acetylated nucleosides demonstrates practical significance in synthetic processes. It simplifies the preparation of partially or differentially substituted nucleoside intermediates. In this mini&#8208;review, we summarized and evaluated recent approaches for regioselective deacetylation in acetylated nucleosides and their analogues. Different regioselectivities (primary ester, secondary ester, full de&#8208;O&#8208;acetylation, and de&#8208;N&#8208;acetylation) are summarized and discussed within each section of this report.







Abstract
Nucleoside analogues are a promising class of natural compounds in the pharmaceutical industry, and many antiviral, antibacterial and anticancer drugs have been created through structural modification of nucleosides scaffold. Acyl protecting groups, especially the acetyl group, play an important role in the protection of hydroxy groups in nucleoside synthesis and modification; consequently, numerous methodologies have been put forth for the acetylation of free nucleosides. However, for nucleosides that contain different O&#8208; and N&#8208;based functionalities, selective deprotection of the acetyl group(s) in nucleosides has been studied little, despite its practical significance in simplifying the preparation of partially or differentially substituted nucleoside intermediates. In this mini&#8208;review, recent approaches for regioselective deacetylation in acetylated nucleosides and their analogues are summarized and evaluated. Different regioselectivities (primary ester, secondary ester, full de&#8208;O&#8208;acetylation, and de&#8208;N&#8208;acetylation) are summarized and discussed in each section.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nucleoside analogues are a promising class of natural compounds in the pharmaceutical industry, and many antiviral, antibacterial and anticancer drugs have been created through structural modification of nucleosides scaffold. Acyl protecting groups, especially the acetyl group, play an important role in the protection of hydroxy groups in nucleoside synthesis and modification; consequently, numerous methodologies have been put forth for the acetylation of free nucleosides. However, for nucleosides that contain different &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-based functionalities, selective deprotection of the acetyl group(s) in nucleosides has been studied little, despite its practical significance in simplifying the preparation of partially or differentially substituted nucleoside intermediates. In this mini-review, recent approaches for regioselective deacetylation in acetylated nucleosides and their analogues are summarized and evaluated. Different regioselectivities (primary ester, secondary ester, full de-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-acetylation, and de-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylation) are summarized and discussed in each section.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Changes in ROS/RNS Levels in Endothelial Cells in Experimental Bacteremia</title>

Article &#8220;Changes in ROS/RNS Levels in Endothelial Cells in Experimental Bacteremia&#8221;. During inflammation, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) perform an important regulatory function. The developed electrochemical amperometric method makes it possible to precisely measure the quantity of ROS/RNS inside endothelial cells. Modeling bacteremia with Staphylococcus aureus, the level of ROS/RNS inside endothelial cells increases both when they exposed to bacteria alone and after contact of endothelial cells with neutrophils.







Abstract
A high&#8208;precision system was developed for the quantification of biological analytes in single cells (reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS)) based on the electrochemical amperometric method. The efficacy of this system was evaluated using an experimental bacteremia model. Endothelial cells exhibited increased ROS/RNS production when stimulated by Staphylococcus aureus. However, they remained inactive when exposed to either unprimed or primed neutrophils that had been pre&#8208;incubated with bacteria. It is noteworthy that the sequential stimulation of endothelial cells with bacteria followed by neutrophils resulted in a significant increase in the ROS/RNS level, which demonstrated a correlation with the number of neutrophils in contact with the endothelial cells. These results highlight the potential of our system to quantitatively assess ROS/RNS dynamics in complex biological systems. They also offer insights into the interplay between various cellular components in experimental bacteremia.

         <title>Mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;Ribosylation of Peptides: An Overview of Synthetic and Chemoenzymatic Methodologies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)&#8208;ribosylation is a post&#8208;translational modification that regulates key biological processes. It occurs on a wide range of amino acids, including arginine, cysteine, serine, and glutamic acid. Well&#8208;defined ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides are valuable tools for investigating the structures, mechanisms of action, and interaction partners of this modification. This article provides a comprehensive overview of chemical and chemoenzymatic methodologies for the construction of mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides.







Abstract
Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)&#8208;ribosylation is a ubiquitous post&#8208;translational modification that regulates vital biological processes like histone reorganization and DNA&#8208;damage repair through the modification of various amino acid residues. Due to advances in mass&#8208;spectrometry, the collection of long&#8208;known ADP&#8208;ribose (ADPr) acceptor sites, e.&#8201;g. arginine, cysteine and glutamic acid, has been expanded with serine, tyrosine and histidine, among others. Well&#8208;defined ADPr&#8208;peptides are valuable tools for investigating the exact structures, mechanisms of action and interaction partners of the different flavors of this modification. This review provides a comprehensive overview of synthetic and chemoenzymatic methodologies that enabled the construction of peptides mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated on various amino acids, and close mimetics thereof.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Binding Oligonucleotide Backbone Modifications for Targeting a DNA&#8208;Processing Metalloenzyme</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA oligonucleotides bearing a modified internucleotide linkage that enables chelation of zinc ions were synthesized. Modifications included urea, squaramide, sulfanylacetamide and sulfinylacetamide moieties. The interaction of the oligonucleotides with the zinc&#8208;dependent DNA repair enzyme SNM1A was studied. The oligonucleotides were capable of strong binding to SNM1A, and the most potent compound inhibited SNM1A activity with an IC50 of 231&#8197;nM.







Abstract
A series of chemically&#8208;modified oligonucleotides for targeting the DNA repair nuclease SNM1A have been designed and synthesised. Each oligonucleotide contains a modified internucleotide linkage designed to both mimic the native phosphodiester backbone and chelate to the catalytic zinc ion(s) in the SNM1A active site. Dinucleoside phosphoramidites containing urea, squaramide, sulfanylacetamide, and sulfinylacetamide linkages were prepared and employed successfully in solid&#8208;phase oligonucleotide synthesis. All the modified oligonucleotides were found to interact with SNM1A in a gel electrophoresis&#8208;based assay, demonstrating the first examples of inhibition of DNA damage repair enzymes for many of these groups in oligonucleotides. One strand containing a sulfinylacetamide&#8208;linkage was found to have the strongest interaction with SNM1A and was further tested in a real&#8208;time fluorescence assay. This allowed an IC50 value of 231&#8197;nM to be determined, significantly lower than previously reported substrate&#8208;mimics targeting this enzyme. It is expected that these modified oligonucleotides will serve as a scaffold for the future development of fluorescent or biotin&#8208;labelled probes for the in&#8197;vivo study of DNA repair processes.

         <title>In Vitro Selection and Characterization of a Light&#8208;up DNA Aptamer for Thiazole Orange</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the differences between RNA and DNA aptamers for the same target molecule. In vitro selection was used to identify a DNA version of the aptamer for Thiazole Orange. The resulting sequences were analyzed using computational tools to discover aptamer candidates, and several were characterized with biophysical techniques.







Abstract
A new DNA aptamer that binds to the target Thiazole Orange&#8208;biotin (TO1&#8208;biotin) was isolated after nine rounds of in&#8197;vitro selection. The selection was performed on streptavidin&#8208;coated beads with the target bound to the surface and with free dye in solution in higher selection rounds to select for slower off&#8208;rate binding. Using next&#8208;generation sequencing (NGS), the libraries after the 4th and 9th rounds of selection were sequenced to identify enriched sequences. Several sequence families emerged, showing superior fluorescence enhancement and high affinity for the target compared to the other families obtained by NGS analysis. These sequence families were further studied to understand the binding interactions better. Primary sequence and secondary structure analysis tools were used to identify a hypothetical three&#8208;tiered G&#8208;quadruplex motif for these families. This indicates that the TO1&#8208;biotin DNA aptamer identified here uses a similar ligand&#8208;binding topology to the original Mango RNA aptamer.

         <title>Genome Mining Leads to the Identification of a Stable and Promiscuous Baeyer&#8208;Villiger Monooxygenase from a Thermophilic Microorganism</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using sequence similarity networks, a stable and substrate&#8208;promiscuous enzyme from Chloroflexota bacterium (strain G233), named ssnBVMO, is identified. ssnBVMO exhibits high melting temperature, kinetic stability, broad substrate scope, and high conversion rates, making it a promising candidate for industrial biocatalyst engineering. Additionally, fusion proteins incorporating ssnBVMO and phosphite dehydrogenase enable NADPH recycling.







Abstract
Baeyer&#8211;Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) are NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent flavoproteins that convert ketones to esters and lactones. While these enzymes offer an appealing alternative to traditional Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidations, these proteins tend to be either too unstable or exhibit too narrow of a substrate scope for implementation as industrial biocatalysts. Here, sequence similarity networks were used to search for novel BVMOs that are both stable and promiscuous. Our genome mining led to the identification of an enzyme from Chloroflexota bacterium (strain G233) dubbed ssnBVMO that exhibits i) the highest melting temperature of any naturally sourced BVMO (62.5&#8201;&#176;C), ii) a remarkable kinetic stability across a wide range of conditions, similar to those of PAMO and PockeMO, iii) optimal catalysis at 50&#8201;&#176;C, and iv) a broad substrate scope that includes linear aliphatic, aromatic, and sterically bulky ketones. Subsequent quantitative assays using propiophenone demonstrated &gt;95&#8201;% conversion. Several fusions were also constructed that linked ssnBVMO to a thermostable phosphite dehydrogenase. These fusions can recycle NADPH and catalyze oxidations with sub&#8208;stoichiometric quantities of this expensive cofactor. Characterization of these fusions permitted identification of PTDH&#8722;L1&#8208;ssnBVMO as the most promising protein that could have utility as a seed sequence for enzyme engineering campaigns aiming to develop biocatalysts for Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidations.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baeyer&#8211;Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) are NAD(P)H-dependent flavoproteins that convert ketones to esters and lactones. While these enzymes offer an appealing alternative to traditional Baeyer-Villiger oxidations, these proteins tend to be either too unstable or exhibit too narrow of a substrate scope for implementation as industrial biocatalysts. Here, sequence similarity networks were used to search for novel BVMOs that are both stable and promiscuous. Our genome mining led to the identification of an enzyme from Chloroflexota bacterium (strain G233) dubbed &lt;i&gt;ssn&lt;/i&gt;BVMO that exhibits i) the highest melting temperature of any naturally sourced BVMO (62.5&#8201;&#176;C), ii) a remarkable kinetic stability across a wide range of conditions, similar to those of PAMO and PockeMO, iii) optimal catalysis at 50&#8201;&#176;C, and iv) a broad substrate scope that includes linear aliphatic, aromatic, and sterically bulky ketones. Subsequent quantitative assays using propiophenone demonstrated &amp;gt;95&#8201;% conversion. Several fusions were also constructed that linked &lt;i&gt;ssn&lt;/i&gt;BVMO to a thermostable phosphite dehydrogenase. These fusions can recycle NADPH and catalyze oxidations with sub-stoichiometric quantities of this expensive cofactor. Characterization of these fusions permitted identification of PTDH&#8722;L1-&lt;i&gt;ssn&lt;/i&gt;BVMO as the most promising protein that could have utility as a seed sequence for enzyme engineering campaigns aiming to develop biocatalysts for Baeyer-Villiger oxidations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Substitution Effects on Subcellular Organelle Localization in Live&#8208;cell Imaging</title>

A series of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A indole&#8208;containing fluorescent probes were developed and studied for their photophysical properties and suitability for subcellular imaging.

Abstract
A series of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A indole&#8208;containing fluorescent probes were developed, followed by an investigation of their photophysical properties and compounds&#8217; suitability for subcellular imaging in living cells. We demonstrate that the preference for mitochondrial localization was lost when morpholine was substituted, resulting in the accumulation of the molecule in the lysosomes. However, interestingly, the presence of a nitro group led to their localization within the lipid droplets despite the presence of the morpholine pendant. We also showcase the probes&#8217; sensitivity to pH, the influence of added chloroquine, and the temperature response on the changes in fluorescence intensity within lysosomes. The design of the probes with strong intramolecular charge transfer and substantial Stokes shift could facilitate extensive application in various cellular lysosomal models and contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in stimuli&#8208;responsive diseases.

         <title>Modulating Polymerase Activity through Light&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Voltage Domain Insertion</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biochemical reaction networks adapt to environmental conditions by sensing chemical or physical stimuli and using tightly controlled mechanisms. While most signals come from molecules, many cells can also sense and respond to light. Among the biomolecular structures that enable light sensing, we selected a light&#8208;oxygen&#8208;voltage (LOV) domain in a previous study that tested the engineering of novel regulatory mechanisms into a nucleic acid polymerase. In this follow&#8208;up study, we studied the activities of previously selected variants in kinetic detail, and we generated additional LOV&#8208;polymerase fusion variants based on further insertion criteria. Our results provide mechanistic insights into how LOV domain insertion influences polymerase activity in a light&#8208;responsive manner: All active and photoresponsive enzyme variants studied by us to date were partially inhibited (i.e., &#8220;turned off&#8221;) after irradiation with blue light at 470 nm, which can be explained by specific obstructions of the polymerase entry or exit structures (substrate entry channels or product exit channels, or both). Although the effects observed are moderate, we anticipate further engineering strategies that could be used to improve the extent of switchability and possibly to develop a &#8220;turn&#8208;on mode&#8221; insertion.</dc:description>

         <title>Previously Published Phosphatase Probes Have Limited Utility Due To Their Unspecific Reactivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores using activity&#8208;based protein profiling to target protein tyrosine phosphatases. With the discovery of allosteric SHP2 inhibitors, this enzyme family has resurfaced as interesting drug targets. Therefore, we envisioned that previously described direct electrophiles and quinone methide&#8208;based traps targeting phosphatases could be applied in competitive activity&#8208;based protein profiling assays. This study evaluates three direct electrophiles, specifically, a vinyl sulfonate, a vinyl sulfone, and an &#945;&#8208;bromobenzylphosphonate as well as three quinone methide&#8208;based traps as activity&#8208;based probes. For all these moieties it was previously shown that they could selectively engage with phosphatases in assays with purified enzymes or overexpressed phosphatases in bacterial lysates. However, this study demonstrates that probes based on these moieties all suffer from unspecific labelling. Direct electrophiles were either unspecific or not activity&#8208;based, while quinone methide&#8208;based traps showed dependence on phosphatase activity but also resulted in unspecific labelling due to diffusion after activation. This phenomenon, termed 'bystander' labelling, occurred even with catalytically inactive SHP2 mutants. We concluded that alternative strategies or chemistries are needed to apply activity&#8208;based protein profiling in phosphatase research. Moreover, this study shows that quinone methide&#8208;based designs have limited potential in probe and inhibitor development strategies due to their intrinsic reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Selenol Switch Assay for Selenoprotein Derivatization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selenoproteins are a class of protein that have selenocysteine (Sec) residues, and essential for diverse cellular functions. Although the human genome encodes 25 selenoproteins, nearly half of these selenoproteins&#8217; function is not clear. This is largely due to the lack of convenient methods to study selenoproteins. We report in this work a novel Selenol Switch assay to exclusively derivatize selenoproteins. The Selenol Switch assay relies on the selective conversion of the Sec residue to the electrophilic dehydroalanine (DHA) residue, which is then labeled by nucleophiles. The multiple reactions of the Selenol Switch assay are readily performed in a single test tube, and the conversion yield is nearly quantitative. The abundance of selenoproteins in mouse tissues determined by the Selenol Switch assay is consistent with that from the classical ICP&#8208;MS assay, validating the reliability of the Selenol Switch assay in studying selenoproteins.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Miniaturized three&#8208;dimensional tissue models, such as spheroids, have become a highly useful and efficient platform to investigate tumor physiology and explore the effect of chemotherapeutic efficacy over traditional two&#8208;dimensional monolayer culture, since they can provide more in&#8208;depth analysis, especially in regards to intercellular interactions and diffusion. The development of most tumor spheroids relies on the high proliferative capacity and self&#8208;aggregation behavior of tumor cells. However, it disregards the effect of microenvironmental factors mediated by extracellular matrix, which are indispensable components of tissue structure. In this study, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells are encapsulated in bioactive microgels consisting of gelatin and hyaluronic acid designed to emulate tumor microenvironment in order to induce hepatic tumor spheroid formation. Two different subtypes of HCC&#8217;s, HepG2 and Hep3B cell lines, are explored. The physicomechanical and biochemical properties of the microgels, controlled by changing the crosslinking density and polymer composition, are clearly shown to have substantial influence over the formation and spheroid formation. Moreover, the spheroids made from different cells and microgel properties display highly variable chemoresistance effects, further highlighting the importance of microenvironmental factors guiding tumor spheroid physiology.</dc:description>

         <title>STING&#8208;Activating Small Molecular Therapeutics for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway has emerged as a potential target for cancer immunotherapy. Novel STING&#8208;activating small molecular therapeutics, including cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) and non&#8208;CDN STING agonists, have been developed to activate the STING pathway for triggering innate immune response. This review introduces the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway and highlights several STING agonists and their clinical development. Furthermore, limitations of these agents and their challenges in clinical translation are discussed.







Abstract
Immuno&#8208;oncology has become a revolutionary strategy for cancer treatment. Therapeutic interventions based on adaptive immunity through immune checkpoint therapy or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have received clinical approval for monotherapy and combination treatment in various cancers. Although these treatments have achieved clinical successes, only a minority of cancer patients show a response, highlighting the urgent need to discover new therapeutic molecules that could be exploited to improve clinical outcomes and pave the way for the next generation of immunotherapy. Given the critical role of the innate immune system against infection and cancer, substantial efforts have been dedicated to developing novel anticancer therapeutics that target these pathways. Targeting the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is a powerful strategy to generate a durable antitumor response, and activation of the adaptor protein STING induces the initiation of transcriptional cascades, thereby producing type I interferons, pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Various STING agonists, including natural or synthetic cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), have been developed as anticancer therapeutics. However, since most CDNs are confined to intratumoral administration, there has been a great interest in developing non&#8208;nucleotide agonists for systemic treatment. Here, we review the current development of STING&#8208;activating therapeutics in both preclinical and clinical stages.

This review introduces the cGAS-STING pathway and highlights several STING agonists and their clinical development. Furthermore, limitations of these agents and their challenges in clinical translation are discussed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immuno-oncology has become a revolutionary strategy for cancer treatment. Therapeutic interventions based on adaptive immunity through immune checkpoint therapy or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have received clinical approval for monotherapy and combination treatment in various cancers. Although these treatments have achieved clinical successes, only a minority of cancer patients show a response, highlighting the urgent need to discover new therapeutic molecules that could be exploited to improve clinical outcomes and pave the way for the next generation of immunotherapy. Given the critical role of the innate immune system against infection and cancer, substantial efforts have been dedicated to developing novel anticancer therapeutics that target these pathways. Targeting the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is a powerful strategy to generate a durable antitumor response, and activation of the adaptor protein STING induces the initiation of transcriptional cascades, thereby producing type I interferons, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Various STING agonists, including natural or synthetic cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), have been developed as anticancer therapeutics. However, since most CDNs are confined to intratumoral administration, there has been a great interest in developing non-nucleotide agonists for systemic treatment. Here, we review the current development of STING-activating therapeutics in both preclinical and clinical stages.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Metastable Semiquinone Molecular Switch Modulated by Ascorbate/O2: A Study from a System Far&#8208;From&#8208;Equilibrium to Biological Assays in Mitochondria</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrrolyl quinone thiocyanate exhibits a switching behaviour between its metastable radical anion structure and its reduced form. The kinetically trapped structure enters a non&#8208;equilibrium state when confronted with ascorbate and oxygen, giving rise to cycles accompanied by a flow of electrons and protons. The compound shows a significant inhibition of the activity of complex III of the electron transport chain.







Abstract
A molecular switch based on the metastable radical anion derived from a substituted heteroaryl quinone is described. Pyrrolyl quinone thiocyanate (PQ 9) showed an interaction with the fluoride anion that was visible to the naked eye and quantified by UV/vis and 1H and 13&#8197;C NMR. The metastable quinoid species formed by the interaction with F&#8722; (&#8220;ON&#8221; state) showed a molecular switching effect autocontrolled by the presence of ascorbate (&#8220;OFF&#8221; state) and back to the &#8220;ON&#8221; state by an autooxidation process, measured by visible and UV/vis spectroscopy. Due to its out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium properties and the exchange of matter and energy, a dissipative structural behaviour is proposed. Considering its similarity to the mechanism of coenzyme Q in oxidative phosphophorylation, PQ 9 was evaluated on Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial function for inhibition of complexes II, III and IV, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, catalase activity and lipid peroxidation. The results showed that PQ 9 inhibited complex III activity as well as the activity of all electron transport chain (ETC) complexes. In addition, PQ 9 reduced ROS production and catalase activity in yeast. The results suggest that PQ 9 may have potential applications as a new microbicidal compound by inducing ETC dysfunction.

         <title>Comparative Study of Immobilized Biolipasa&#8208;R for Second Generation Biodiesel Production from an Acid Oil</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biolipasa&#8208;R immobilized via adsorption on diatomaceous earth and commercial carriers efficiently catalyzes the production of fatty acid methyl esters from acid oils, for the preparation of second&#8208;generation biodiesel. It's performance in this process is superior to benchmark enzyme Novozym&#174; 435.







Abstract
The primary objective of this work is to develop a sustainable biocatalytic transesterification process for low&#8208;grade oils, aligning with EU green technology requirements for the shift to second generation biodiesel. Thus, we investigated the immobilization and subsequent application of the lipase Biolipasa&#8208;R on transesterification processes to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) from both a sunflower oil and an acid oil which is a bioproduct of the biodiesel industry. The lipase was immobilized on biomaterials, such as diatomaceous earth, with a yield of 60&#8201;%, and commercial carriers such as methacrylic resins with a yield of 100&#8201;%. The enzyme demonstrated superior activity when immobilized on diatomaceous earth, particularly in reactions involving the acid oil, outperforming the benchmark enzyme Novozym&#174; 435 (95.1&#8201;% and 35&#8201;% conversion respectively). This work highlights the potential of Biolipasa&#8208;R as a cost&#8208;effective and efficient biocatalyst for biodiesel production and emphasizes the environmental benefits of utilizing industrial byproducts and eco&#8208;friendly immobilization techniques. The findings suggest that Biolipasa&#8208;R is a promising candidate for industrial applications in biodiesel production, offering a sustainable solution for waste management and energy generation.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Halogenated Tryptophans for Protein Engineering Using Genetic Code Expansion</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tryptophan halogenases SttH and RebH catalyze the halogenation of tryptophan at the C&#8208;6 and C&#8208;7 positions, respectively. By introducing the biosynthetic pathways for tryptophan halogenation along with the appropriate aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs, cells can be engineered to produce halogenated tryptophans and site&#8208;specifically incorporate them genetically into proteins of interest.







Abstract
Genetic Code Expansion technology offers significant potential in incorporating noncanonical amino acids into proteins at precise locations, allowing for the modulation of protein structures and functions. However, this technology is often limited by the need for costly and challenging&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize external noncanonical amino acid sources. In this study, we address this limitation by developing autonomous cells capable of biosynthesizing halogenated tryptophan derivatives and introducing them into proteins using Genetic Code Expansion technology. By utilizing inexpensive halide salts and different halogenases, we successfully achieve the selective biosynthesis of 6&#8208;chloro&#8208;tryptophan, 7&#8208;chloro&#8208;tryptophan, 6&#8208;bromo&#8208;tryptophan, and 7&#8208;bromo&#8208;tryptophan. These derivatives are introduced at specific positions with corresponding bioorthogonal aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs in response to the amber codon. Following optimization, we demonstrate the robust expression of proteins containing halogenated tryptophan residues in cells with the ability to biosynthesize these tryptophan derivatives. This study establishes a versatile platform for engineering proteins with various halogenated tryptophans.

         <title>Freezing Functional Nucleic Acids: From Molecular Reactions to Surface Immobilization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Freezing aqueous solution of functional nucleic acids can accelerate reactions across different scales mainly via the freeze&#8208;concentration effect. These reactions include molecular ligation and cleavage, nanoparticle conjugation, and immobilization on bulk surfaces.







Abstract
Biochemical reactions are typically slowed down by decreasing temperature. However, accelerated reaction kinetics have been observed for a long time. More recent examples have highlighted the unique role of freezing in fabricating supermaterials, degrading environmental contaminants, and accelerating bioreactions. Functional nucleic acids are DNA or RNA oligonucleotides with versatile properties, including target recognition, catalysis, and molecular co4mputing. In this review, we discuss the current observations and understanding of freezing&#8208;facilitated reactions involving functional nucleic acids. Molecular reactions such as ligation/conjugation, cleavage, and hybridization are discussed. Moreover, freezing&#8208;induced DNA&#8208;nanoparticle conjugations are introduced. Then, we describe our effect in immobilizing DNA on bulk surfaces. Finally, we address some critical questions and research opportunities in the field.

         <title>Perfect Partners: Biocatalytic Halogenation and Metal Catalysis for Protein Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases (FDHs) are the most extensively researched halogenases and show great potential for biotransformation applications. These enzymes use chloride, bromide, or iodide ions as halogen donors to catalyze the oxygen&#8208;dependent halogenation of electron&#8208;rich aryl moieties, requiring stochiometric amounts of FADH2 in the process. This makes FDH&#8208;catalyzed aryl halogenation a highly selective and environmentally friendly tool for the synthesis of aryl halides. The latter in turn serve as valuable intermediates for transition metal catalyzed cross coupling reactions for C&#8208;C bond formation. Previous research made extensive use of this approach to halogenate small molecules as building blocks for late&#8208;stage functionalization by transition&#8208;metal catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Based on these results, several groups have managed to expand this research to protein targets over the past two years. Their work indicates an emerging methodology for bioconjugation using late&#8208;stage biocatalytic halogenation in conjunction with biorthogonal Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling. This strategy could present an attractive alternative to existing approaches due to the stability of the C&#8208;C bond bridging the generated biaryl moiety and the ease of late&#8208;stage enzymatic modification while maintaining excellent selectivity under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery and Heterologous Expression of Trilenodin, an Antimicrobial Lasso Peptide with a Unique Tri&#8208;isoleucine Motif</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lasso peptides are an increasingly relevant class of peptide natural products with diverse biological activities, intriguing physical properties, and unique chemical structures. Most characterized lasso peptides have been from Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, despite bioinformatic analyses suggesting that other bacterial taxa, particularly those from Firmicutes, are rich in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding lasso peptides. Herein, we report the bioinformatic identification of a lasso peptide BGC from Paenibacillus taiwanensis DSM18679 which we termed pats. We used a bioinformatics&#8208;guided isolation approach and high&#8208;resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS/MS) to isolate and subsequently characterize a new lasso peptide produced from the pats BGC, which we named trilenodin, after the tri&#8208;isoleucine motif present in its primary sequence. This tri&#8208;isoleucine motif is unique among currently characterized lasso peptides. We confirmed the connection between the pats BGC and trilenodin production by establishing the first Bacillus subtilis 168&#8208;based heterologous expression system for expressing Firmicutes lasso peptides. We finally determined that trilenodin exhibits potent antimicrobial activity against B. subtilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae, making trilenodin the first characterized biologically active lasso peptide from Firmicutes. Collectively, we demonstrate that bacteria from Firmicutes can serve as high&#8208;potential sources of chemically and biologically diverse lasso peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Developing Covalent Organic Framework Biocatalysts through Enzyme Encapsulation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 17, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept mainly focuses on the achievements of various cutting&#8208;edge strategies to rational design for enzyme&#8208;COFs biocatalysts. The representative types of these strategies including pore entrapment and in&#8197;situ encapsulation are summarized, and the future opportunities and challenges insight into the timely COFs&#8208;based enzyme immobilization technology are discussed.







Abstract
Utilizing covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as porous supports to encapsulate enzyme represents an advanced strategy for constructing COFs biocatalysts, which has inspired numerous interests across various applications. As the structural advantages including ultrastable covalent&#8208;bonded linkage, tailorable pore structure, and metal&#8208;free biocompatibility, the resultant enzyme&#8208;COFs biocatalysts showcase functional enhancement in catalytic activity, chemical stability, long&#8208;term durability, and recyclability. This Concept describes the recent advances in the methodological strategies for engineering the COFs biocatalysts, with specific emphasis on the pore entrapment and in&#8197;situ encapsulation strategies. The structural advantages of the COFs hybrid biocatalysts for organic synthesis, environment&#8208; and energy&#8208;associated applications are also canvassed. Additionally, the remaining challenges and the forward&#8208;looking directions in this field are also discussed. We believe that this Concept can offer useful methodological guidance for developing active and robust COFs biocatalysts.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Catalytic Activity of Protein Containing Thiotyrosine as an Active Site Residue</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 17, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;canonical amino acid thiotyrosine was incorporated into a small cyclic protein by chemical synthesis. Thanks to the aryl&#8208;thiol containing side chain, it is able to serve as a catalyst for ester hydrolysis and native chemical ligation of peptides.







Abstract
Native chemical ligation is a key reaction in the toolbox of chemical methods for the synthesis of native and modified proteins. The catalysis of ligation is commonly performed by using small aryl&#8208;thiol molecules added at high concentrations. In this work, we incorporated thiotyrosine, a non&#8208;canonical amino acid containing an aryl&#8208;thiol moiety, into a designed cyclic protein &#171; sans queue ni t&#234;te &#187;. Importantly, the protein environment reduced the pKa of the thiol group to 5.8&#8211;5.9, which is significantly lower than the previously reported value for thiotyrosine in a short peptide (pKa 6.4). Furthermore, we demonstrated the catalytic activity of this protein both as hydrolase and in native chemical ligation of peptides. These results will be useful for the development of efficient protein catalysts (enzymes) for protein synthesis and modification.

         <title>Catalytic and Selective Red Light&#8208;Triggered Photodegradation of a G&#8208;Quadruplex DNA by a Zinc (II) Phthalocyanine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 17, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red&#8208;light irradiation of a Zn(II) Pc derivative leads to catalytic and selective photodegradation of the G&#8208;quadruplex DNA by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the Zn(II) Pc derivative bound to DNA through a reaction mechanism similar to that of an enzyme reaction.







Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble phthalocyanine (Pc) derivatives have been regarded as potential G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) nucleic acid&#8208;targeting ligands for anticancer therapy and have been extensively studied as effective photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy (PDT). Understanding how photosensitizers interact with nucleic acids and the subsequent photolytic reactions is essential for deciphering the initial steps of PDT, thereby aiding in the development of new photosensitizing agents. In this study, we found that red&#8208;light irradiation of a mixture of a Zn(II) Pc derivative and an all&#8208;parallel G4 DNA leads to catalytic and selective photodegradation of the DNA by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the Zn(II) Pc derivative bound to DNA through a reaction mechanism similar to that of an enzyme reaction. This finding provides a novel insight into the molecular design of a photosensitizer to enhance its PDT efficacy.

         <title>Chemoproteomic Strategy Identifies PfUCHL3 as the Target of Halofuginone</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 17, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
PfUCHL3 was identified as a previously unrecognized anti&#8208;P.&#8197;falciparum target of halofuginone (HF) through chemical biology strategies. The allosteric modulation of PfUCHL3 stemmed from the potential formation of three hydrogen bonds between HF and PfUCHL3, thereby perturbing the protein&#8208;protein interaction network. PfUCHL3 played a crucial role in regulating the amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism, thereby inhibiting the growth of P.&#8197;falciparum.







Abstract
The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (P.&#8197;falciparum) continues to pose a significant public health challenge, leading to millions of fatalities globally. Halofuginone (HF) has shown a significant anti&#8208;P.&#8197;falciparum effect, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for malaria treatment. In this study, we synthesized a photoaffinity labeling probe of HF to identify its direct target in P.&#8197;falciparum. Our results reveal that ubiquitin carboxyl&#8208;terminal hydrolase 3 (PfUCHL3) acts as a crucial target protein of HF, which modulates parasite growth in the intraerythrocytic cycle. In particular, we discovered that HF potentially forms hydrogen bonds with the Leu10, Glu11, and Arg217 sites of PfUCHL3, thereby inducing an allosteric effect by promoting the embedding of the helix 6&#8217; region on the protein surface. Furthermore, HF disrupts the expression of multiple functional proteins mediated by PfUCHL3, specifically those that play crucial roles in amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism in P.&#8197;falciparum. Taken together, this study highlights PfUCHL3 as a previously undisclosed druggable target of HF, which contributes to the development of novel anti&#8208;malarial agents in the future.

         <title>DNA Aptamer Integrated Hydrogel Nanocomposites on Screen Printed Gold Electrodes for Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Detection of Testosterone in Human Serum</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 17, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new electrochemical aptasensor is described for testosterone detection. It uses a specific DNA sequence on a gold electrode modified with a conductive hydrogel and gold nanoparticles. The sensor responds to testosterone in a dose&#8208;dependent manner, with a detection limit of 0.14 ng/mL. It effectively differentiates testosterone from similar hormones and minimizes interference from biological samples.







Abstract
This work describes the development and evaluation of a novel electrochemical aptasensor for testosterone detection. The sensor utilizes a specifically designed DNA immobilized on a screen&#8208;printed gold electrode (SPGE) modified with a conductive hydrogel and gold nanoparticles (HG/NP) composite. The aptasensor exhibited a dose&#8208;dependent response to testosterone (0.05 to 50 ng/mL) with a detection limit of 0.14 ng/mL and a good sensitivity of 0.23&#8197;&#956;A ng&#8722;1 mL cm&#8722;2. The sensor displayed excellent selectivity towards testosterone compared to structurally similar steroid hormones. Importantly, the incorporation of HG/NP not only improved the sensor&#8216;s conductivity but also acted as an antifouling layer, minimizing signal interference from non&#8208;specific biomolecule interactions in complex biological samples like human serum. The results obtained from the aptasensor showed good correlation with a standard ELISA method, demonstrating its effectiveness in real&#8208;world scenarios.

         <title>Transport of Zinc&#8208;Phthalocyanine to Cancer Cells Using Myoglobin&#8722;Albumin Fusion Protein for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 17, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fusion protein myoglobin&#8208;(human serum albumin) was reconstituted with zinc&#8208;phthalocyanine (ZnPc) to form ZnPcMb&#8208;HSA. The coupling of HSA did not modify the photophysical properties of the ZnPcMb moiety. ZnPc was released from ZnPcMb&#8208;HSA and accumulated within cells, whereas the protein components were not internalized. Treatments with ZnPcMb&#8208;HSA effectively induced apoptosis upon red&#8208;light irradiation in various cell lines.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a noninvasive approach to cancer treatment, wherein cell death is initiated by singlet oxygen (1O2) production via energy transfer from excited photosensitizers to ground&#8208;state O2. Effective clinical photosensitizers necessitate water solubility for in&#8197;vivo administration. Hydrophobic dyes, such as phthalocyanines, cannot be used directly as photosensitizers. Herein, we synthesized a myoglobin&#8208;(human serum albumin) fusion protein reconstituted with zinc&#8208;phthalocyanine (ZnPc), termed ZnPcMb&#8208;HSA. The photophysical properties of ZnPcMb&#8208;HSA closely resemble those of ZnPc&#8208;substituted Mb. Notably, ZnPc dissociates from ZnPcMb&#8208;HSA and selectively accumulates within cancer cells, while the protein components remain extracellular. Treatment of four distinct cell lines with ZnPcMb&#8208;HSA, followed by red&#8208;light irradiation, effectively induced apoptosis. The half&#8208;maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) against these cancer cell lines ranged between 0.1&#8211;0.5&#8197;&#956;M. Reconstituted Mb&#8208;HSA emerges as a promising carrier for transporting various water&#8208;insoluble porphyrinoid photosensitizer to target cancer cells in PDT applications.

         <title>Prussian Blue&#8208;Assisted NIR Triggered In&#8208;Situ Polymerized Nanocomposite Hydrogel for Wound Repair</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 17, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The free radical initiator was encapsulated in the hollow Prussian blue by a phase change material to maintain stability. The near&#8208;infrared (NIR) triggered the photothermal conversion of Prussian blue, resulting in an increase in temperature. The melted phase change material released the initiator and the free radicals generated by the decomposition of the initiator initiated the reaction of double bonds to form a cross&#8208;linked network. The quaternary amine groups of modified chitosan and the photothermal properties of Prussian blue enhanced the antimicrobial properties of the hydrogel. High&#8208;quality wound healing was demonstrated in the whole skin defect model.







Abstract
Hydrogels are commonly used as wound dressings to help maintain a moist environment around the wound and isolate contaminants, thus promoting healing. For irregular wounds, the slow healing process and even infection may occur due to the inability of dressings to adhere well to the wound. Prussian blue (PB) is a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) material with excellent photothermal conversion and superior stability. In this paper, a kind of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light triggered in&#8208;situ polymerized antimicrobial hydrogel was prepared. The free radical initiator was encapsulated in the hollow PB by a phase change material (PCM) to maintain stability. The raised temperature triggered by NIR induced the release and decomposition of the initiator. The matrix was formed by the cross&#8208;linking of double bonds on modified chitosan. The quaternary amine groups of modified chitosan and the photothermal properties of PB enhanced the antimicrobial properties of the hydrogel. High&#8208;quality wound healing was demonstrated in the whole skin defect model. This study provides a new reference for the preparation of in&#8208;situ polymerized hydrogel dressings for irregular wounds.

         <title>Construction of Smartphone&#8208;Integrated Nanozyme Sensor Based on Amino Acid&#8208;Modulated Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 17, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work constructed peroxidase&#8208;like nanozymes (Au NPs@His) with high catalytic activity of hydrogen peroxide by amino acids&#8208;induced synthesis. The nanozymes have been used to glucose colorimetric detection with a detection limit of 2.904&#8197;&#956;M, enabling visual detection via a smartphone platform and showing the potential of histidine as a reducing agent in constructing Au nanomaterials exerting enzyme&#8208;like catalysis.







Abstract
Amino acids are not only the building blocks of proteins but also lead to the development of novel nanomaterials with unique properties. Herein, we proposed a simple strategy to produce gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) with peroxidase&#8208;like (POD&#8208;like) activities by using a series of amino acids as reducing agents, named Au NPs@M (M represents different amino acids). The Au NPs@His was identified as the nanozyme with the most potent catalytic performance, which was used in combination with smartphones to achieve rapid detection of hydrogen peroxide with a detection limit of 0.966&#8197;&#956;M. It also enables rapid detection of glucose with a detection limit of 2.904&#8197;&#956;M, highlighting the significant contribution of Au NPs@His in expediting the detection of critical biomolecules. This work not only provides a convenient and highly efficient method to identify glucose but also shows the potential of histidine as a reducing agent in constructing Au nanomaterials exerting enzyme&#8208;like catalysis.

         <title>Chemical Resolution of an Epitope Recognized by Blood Group Antibodies Capable of Binding Both A and B Red Blood Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 17, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antibodies were isolated from the blood of group O individuals that bound equally to antigens A and B, including agglutination of erythrocytes both A and B. STD NMR data correspond to the topography of the predicted epitope: STD&#8208;active H atoms, shown in red, are concentrated at the same epitope subsite.







Abstract
The high specificity of human antibodies to blood group A and B antigens is impressive, especially when considering the structural difference between these antigens (tetrasaccharides) is a NHAc versus a hydroxyl group on the terminal monosaccharide residue. It is well established that in addition to anti&#8208;A and anti&#8208;B there is a third antibody, anti&#8208;A,B capable of recognizing both A and B antigens. To analyze this AB specificity, we synthesized a tetrasaccharide, where the NHAc of the A antigen was replaced with an NH2. This NH2 group was then used to attach the glycan to an affinity resin, creating an AB epitope (ABep) adsorbent where the critical site for recognition by A and B antibodies was not accessible, while the rest of the (conformationally compact) tetrasaccharide remained accessible. Anti&#8208;ABep antibodies were then isolated from blood group O donors and found to have expected A,B specificity against immobilized and red cell bound synthetic antigens, including ABep, and were able to agglutinate both A and B red cells. The amount of these anti&#8208;ABep (anti&#8208;A,B) antibodies found in the blood of group O donors was comparable to levels of anti&#8208;A and anti&#8208;B found in group B and A individuals. Using STD&#8208;NMR the location for the AB epitope on the tetrasaccharide was found.

&lt;p&gt;Antibodies were isolated from the blood of group O individuals that bound equally to antigens A and B, including agglutination of erythrocytes both A and B. STD NMR data correspond to the topography of the predicted epitope: STD-active &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt; atoms, shown in red, are concentrated at the same epitope subsite.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high specificity of human antibodies to blood group A and B antigens is impressive, especially when considering the structural difference between these antigens (tetrasaccharides) is a NHAc versus a hydroxyl group on the terminal monosaccharide residue. It is well established that in addition to anti-A and anti-B there is a third antibody, anti-A,B capable of recognizing both A and B antigens. To analyze this AB specificity, we synthesized a tetrasaccharide, where the NHAc of the A antigen was replaced with an NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group was then used to attach the glycan to an affinity resin, creating an AB epitope (AB&lt;sup&gt;ep&lt;/sup&gt;) adsorbent where the critical site for recognition by A and B antibodies was not accessible, while the rest of the (conformationally compact) tetrasaccharide remained accessible. Anti-AB&lt;sup&gt;ep&lt;/sup&gt; antibodies were then isolated from blood group O donors and found to have expected A,B specificity against immobilized and red cell bound synthetic antigens, including AB&lt;sup&gt;ep&lt;/sup&gt;, and were able to agglutinate both A and B red cells. The amount of these anti-AB&lt;sup&gt;ep&lt;/sup&gt; (anti-A,B) antibodies found in the blood of group O donors was comparable to levels of anti-A and anti-B found in group B and A individuals. Using STD-NMR the location for the AB epitope on the tetrasaccharide was found.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploration of Rhenium Bisquinoline Tricarbonyl Complexes for their Antibacterial Properties</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 17, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work explores the antimicrobial properties of eight newly synthesized rhenium tricarbonyl bisquinoline derivatives. Their biological properties are explored in detail with most compounds showing strong antibacterial properties but also cytotoxicity. In mode of action studies, in Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, a distinct pore&#8208;forming effect on the bacterial membrane is observed.







Abstract
Metal complexes have emerged as a promising source for novel classes of antibacterial agents to combat the rise of antimicrobial resistance around the world. In the exploration of the transition metal chemical space for novel metalloantibiotics, the rhenium tricarbonyl moiety has been identified as a promising scaffold. Here we have prepared eight novel rhenium bisquinoline tricarbonyl complexes and explored their antibacterial properties. Significant activity against both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria was observed. However, all complexes also showed significant toxicity against human cells, putting into question the prospects of this specific rhenium compound class as metalloantibiotics. To better understand their biological effects, we conduct the first mode of action studies on rhenium bisquinoline complexes and show that they are able to form pores through bacterial membranes. Their straight&#8208;forward synthesis and tuneability suggests that further optimisation of this compound class could lead to compounds with enhanced bacterial specificity.

         <title>Oxidation&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Hydrogels Based on Glucosamine Derivatives with an Aryl Sulfide Group</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 17, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glucosamine derivative bearing an aryl sulfide group can self&#8208;assemble into fibrous networks to form hydrogels. Hydrogen peroxide can induce a gel&#8211;sol transition by the oxidation of the sulfide group to the corresponding sulfoxide. Furthermore, we show that this oxidation&#8208;responsiveness can be extended to photo&#8208;responsiveness with the aid of a photosensitizer.







Abstract
Supramolecular hydrogels can be obtained via self&#8208;assembly of small molecules in aqueous environments. In this study, we describe the development of oxidation&#8208;responsive supramolecular hydrogels comprising glucosamine derivatives with an aryl sulfide group. We demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide can induce a gel&#8211;sol transition through the oxidation of the sulfide group to the corresponding sulfoxide. Furthermore, we show that this oxidation responsiveness can be extended to photo&#8208;responsiveness with the aid of a photosensitizer.

         <title>A Bispecific Chimeric Aptamer Design Platform Based on c&#8208;MET Aptamer with a Replaceable Redundant Region</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 17, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA aptamer, HF3&#8208;58, selected by cell&#8208;SELEX, was demonstrated to bind c&#8208;MET with high affinity. Its structure and mechanism of c&#8208;MET recognition were studied, revealing the scaffold, recognition, and redundancy regions. Its redundancy region was replaced with other aptamers, yielding bispecific aptamers for binding to c&#8208;MET and specific proteins. A bispecific aptamer HF&#8208;3b showed the ability to mediate the adhesion of T&#8208;cells to tumor cells.







Abstract
Molecular engineering enables the creation of aptamers with novel functions, but the prerequisite is a deep understanding of their structure and recognition mechanism. The cellular&#8208;mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (c&#8208;MET) is garnering significant attention due to the critical role of the c&#8208;MET/HGF signaling pathway in tumor development and invasion. This study reports a strategy for constructing novel chimeric aptamers that bind to both c&#8208;MET and other specific proteins. c&#8208;MET was identified to be the molecular target of a DNA aptamer, HF3&#8208;58, selected through cell&#8208;SELEX. The binding structure and mechanism of HF3&#8208;58 with c&#8208;MET were systematically studied, revealing the scaffold, recognition, and redundancy regions. Through molecular engineering design, the redundancy region was replaced with other aptamers possessing stem&#8208;loop structures, yielding novel chimeric aptamers with bispecificity for binding to c&#8208;MET and specific proteins. A chimeric bispecific aptamer HF&#8208;3b showed the ability to mediate the adhesion of T&#8208;cells to tumor cells, suggesting the prospective utility in tumor immunotherapy. These findings suggest that aptamer HF3&#8208;58 can serve as a molecular engineering platform for the development of diverse multifunctional ligands targeting c&#8208;MET. Moreover, comprehensive understanding of the binding mechanisms of aptamers will provide guidance for the design of functional aptamers, significantly expanding their potential applications.

         <title>Front Cover: Design, Synthesis and Catalytic Activity of Protein Containing Thiotyrosine as an Active Site Residue (ChemBioChem 17/2024)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 17, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Native chemical ligation (NCL) is a key reaction used in chemical protein synthesis. A protein catalyst is designed with a non&#8208;canonical thiotyrosine (TyrSH) residue in the active site and is shown to outperform commonly used small aryl&#8208;thiol molecules. This protein functions like a baseball glove, &#8220;catching&#8221; the acyl&#8208;donor peptide substrate via thiol&#8208;thioester exchange with TyrSH to form aryl&#8208;thioester, which is rapidly attacked by N&#8208;terminal cysteinyl thiolate of the acyl&#8208;acceptor peptide substrate. More information can be found in the Research Article 10.1002/cbic.202400148 by Vladimir Torbeev and co&#8208;workers.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 25, Issue 17, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal complexes are a promising compound class against antimicrobial resistance. In exploring transition metal compounds, rhenium tricarbonyl has emerged as a promising scaffold. In article 10.1002/cbic.202400435, Angelo Frei and co&#8208;workers prepare eight novel rhenium bisquinoline tricarbonyl complexes, observing significant activity against both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. However, these complexes show significant human cell toxicity, challenging their prospects as metalloantibiotics. The authors conduct the first mode of action studies, revealing pore formation in bacterial membranes. Their straightforward synthesis and tunability suggest potential for further optimization to enhance bacterial specificity.

In article &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/cbic.202400435"&gt;10.1002/cbic.202400435, Angelo Frei and co-workers&lt;/a&gt; prepare eight novel rhenium bisquinoline tricarbonyl complexes, observing significant activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. However, these complexes show significant human cell toxicity, challenging their prospects as metalloantibiotics. The authors conduct the first mode of action studies, revealing pore formation in bacterial membranes. Their straightforward synthesis and tunability suggest potential for further optimization to enhance bacterial specificity.

         <dc:description>
Photocaged amino acids could be genetically encoded into proteins via genetic code expansion and constitute unique tools for innovative protein engineering. Herein, we would like to summarize the efforts in encoding photocaged proteinogenic and non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids, hoping to draw more attention to this fruitful and exciting scientific campaign.







Abstract
Photocaged amino acids could be genetically encoded into proteins via genetic code expansion (GCE) and constitute unique tools for innovative protein engineering. There are a number of photocaged proteinogenic amino acids that allow strategic conversion of proteins into their photocaged variants, thus enabling spatiotemporal and non&#8208;invasive regulation of protein functions using light. Meanwhile, there are a hand of photocaged non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids that address the challenges in directly encoding certain non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) that structurally resemble proteinogenic ones or possess highly reactive functional groups. Herein, we would like to summarize the efforts in encoding photocaged proteinogenic and non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids, hoping to draw more attention to this fruitful and exciting scientific campaign.

         <title>Channel Engineering of a Glutamate Exporter</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanosensitive channel MscCG2 is involved in glutamate excretion in most C. glutamicum strains. Improving the excretion efficiency of MscCG2 is beneficial to the production of glutamate. In this study, structure&#8208;based rational design was carried out to obtain an improved efflux ability of exporter MscCG2 and its mechanistic advance via two strategies: widening the channel entrance for smoother entry of glutamate and reducing the electronegativity at the entrance of the channels to minimize the rejection of negatively charged glutamate entry. The designed variants were found to enhance glutamate excretion by 2 to 3.3&#8208;fold in the early phase and 1.1&#8208;fold to 1.5&#8208;fold in the late phase of fermentation. The enhanced glutamate excretion was further confirmed by using glutamate toxic analog 4&#8208;fluoroglutamate (4&#8208;FG) and Glu&#8208;Glu peptide uptake and glutamate export assay. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations revealed that the amino acid substitutions indeed enlarged the channel entrance and reduced the repulsion of glutamate when entering the channel. The finding of this study is important for understanding the underlying structure&#8208;function relationship and the mechanism of glutamate secretion to improve glutamate efflux efficiency of glutamate exporter.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Lower Limit of Target Concentration in Capture&#8208;SELEX Using Guanine as a Model Target</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During an aptamer selection, using a lower target concentration may result in aptamers with a higher binding affinity. Consequently, this begs the question of whether there is a lower limit for target concentration. In this work, we conducted three aptamer selections using 5 &#181;M, 500 nM and 50 nM guanine as the targets, respectively. Successful enrichment of the same guanine aptamers was achieved at both 5 &#181;M and 500 nM guanine, but not with 50 nM. Using 5 &#181;M guanine, the aptamer was enriched in eight rounds of selection, compared to that for 500 nM, which was accomplished in 17 rounds. We discuss the relation of optimal target concentration to the observed Kd value of the resulting aptamers, of which the highest affinity aptamer had a measured Kd of 200 nM. Additionally, we investigated the binding of the aptamers through mutation studies, revealing a critical cytosine. Mutating this cytosine to a thymine switched the selectivity from guanine to adenine, which is reminiscent of the guanine riboswitch. This study revealed a limit in using low target concentration, and the insights described in this article will be useful for guiding the choice of target concentration during capture&#8208;SELEX.</dc:description>

         <title>Nuclear&#8208;targeting Peptides for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleus is the central regulator of cells that controls cell proliferation, metabolism, and cell cycle, and is considered the most important organelle in cells. The precision medicine that can achieve nuclear targeting has achieved good therapeutic effects in anti&#8208;tumor therapy. However, the presence of biological barriers such as cell membranes and nuclear membranes in cells limit the delivery of therapeutic agents to the nucleus. Therefore, developing effective nuclear&#8208;targeting drug delivery strategies is particularly important. Nuclear&#8208;targeting peptides are a class of functional peptides that can penetrate cell membranes and target the nucleus. They mainly recognize and bind to the nuclear transport molecules (such as Importin&#8208;&#945;/&#946;) and transport the therapeutic agents to the nucleus through nuclear pore complexes (NPC). This review summarizes the most recent developments of strategies for anti&#8208;tumor therapy utilizing nuclear&#8208;targeting peptides, which will ultimately contribute to the development of more effective nuclear&#8208;targeting strategies to achieve better anti&#8208;tumor outcomes.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we have designed and synthesised a 2,6&#8208;dihydroxybenzoyl&#8208;hydrazone (compound 3) fluorophore through a concise strategy. Molecular dynamics and quantum chemical simulations revealed that long range charge transfer (CT) to be the underlying mechanism for the emissive property of compound 3. Confocal microscopy and cell viability assays confirmed that within 3h, compound 3 homed into the Golgi&#8208;apparatus of colon cancer cells (HCT&#8208;116) selectively compared to the breast (MCF7), lung (A549), cervical (HeLa) cancer cells and non&#8208;cancerous retinal epithelial pigment cells (RPE&#8208;1) with negligible toxicity. This novel fluorophore has potential to image Golgi&#8208;apparatus in a cancer cell specific manner for diagnosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the World of Curcumin: Photophysics, Photochemistry, and Applications in Nanoscience and Biology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The importance of curcumin lies not only in its photophysical properties but also in its diverse applications in nanoscience and biology.







Abstract
Curcumin is a bright yellow naturally occurring polyphenol which is the principal component of turmeric. It is used as herbal supplement, cosmetics ingredient, and food coloring agent. Over the years, the therapeutic properties of the natural product curcumin have gone unexploited but not unnoticed. Curcumin cannot be employed as a drug due to limitations such as low aqueous solubility and limited bioavailability. Many attempts have been made to overcome these limitations by confining the drug in various confined media to enhance its bioavailability. The biomolecule is emissive and undergoes fundamental excited state processes such as solvation dynamics and excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT). Curcumin based biomaterials and nanomaterials are also a fast advancing field where curcumin is an intrinsic component necessary for formation of these materials and no longer added as an external free drug. In this review, we will summarize the recent research on the photophysical and photochemical properties of curcumin and its excited state dynamics in various bio&#8208;mimicking systems. At the same time we wish to also incorporate the various applications of curcumin, especially in biology. Lastly due to the growing importance of materials science, we will briefly discuss some recent advances on curcumin based biomaterials and nanomaterials. We believe such a compilation of recent research surrounding curcumin will provide an overall understanding of its potentialities in different areas.

         <title>Irreversible Inhibition of DNMT3A by an N&#8208;Mustard Analog of S&#8208;Adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA methylation, an important epigenetic modification, is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases and is essential in the regulation of gene expression. Here, the utility of an N&#8208;mustard analog designed to mimic the native methyl donor, S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM), was explored with the DNA methyltransferase 3A catalytic domain (DNMT3AC). In lieu of the expected analog transfer to DNA, methyltransferase activity was instead inhibited in a concentration dependent manner. Further investigation into the mechanism of analog inhibition did not reveal a typical competitive mechanism. Instead, mass spectrometry analysis provided direct evidence of two cysteine residues in the SAM binding site covalently modified by the SAM analog and confirmed its&#8217; function as an irreversible inhibitor of DNMT3AC.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemo&#8208;enzymatic Functionalization of Bovine Milk Exosomes with an EGFR Nanobody for Target&#8208;specific Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bovine milk exosomes (BmExo) have been identified as versatile nanovesicles for anti&#8208;cancer drugs delivery due to their natural availability and biocompatibility. However, tumor&#8208;specific delivery based on BmExo often requires post&#8208;isolation modifications of the membrane surface with active&#8208;targeting ligands. In this study, we report an alternative approach to functionalize BmExo with nanobody using Sortase A&#8208;mediated site&#8208;specific ligation for drug delivery. The BmExo membrane was first coated with a diglycine&#8208;containing amphiphile molecule, NH2&#8208;GG&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;DSPE, through hydrophobic insertion, following by ligation with EGFR nanobody (7D12) by Sortase A (SrtA). The successful construction of BmExo&#8208;7D12 was confirmed by Western blotting analysis, electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering (DLS). As a demonstration model, BmExo&#8208;7D12 loaded with the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (Dox) was shown to be able to deliver Dox to cancer cells in response to the expression of EGFR as manifested by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry analysis. Finally, the cytotoxicity assay showed that BmExo&#8208;7D12&#8208;Dox was more effective in killing tumor cells with high EGFR expression while significantly reduced the non&#8208;specific toxicity to EGFR negative cells. This study developed an effective approach to functionalize BmExo with nanobody for target&#8208;specific drug delivery. This approach should prove to be versatile and efficient for the generation of protein&#8208;ligands modified BmExo.</dc:description>

         <title>Immunomodulatory Synthetic Glycocluster Molecule Prevents Melanoma Growth In Vivo</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triacedimannose (TADM) a novel synthetic glycocluster molecule and an activator of macrophages, is able to induce pro&#8208;inflammatory responses in&#8197;vivo. Here, we show that TADM demonstrates efficacy in a murine melanoma model in hindering tumour growth, inducing apoptosis, and enhancing anti&#8208;tumour immune response comparable to established anti&#8208;PD1 checkpoint inhibitor treatment.







Abstract
Triacedimannose (TADM) is a synthetic trivalent acetylated glycocluster and a transmembrane macrophage activator independent of the mannose receptor. TADM induces Th1&#8208;type immune responses and suppresses Th2&#8208;type cytokines in acute and chronic allergic inflammation models in&#8197;vivo. We, therefore, wanted to test whether TADM could also facilitate anti&#8208;tumour tissue responses similar to what has been observed for the immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 and anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4. A syngeneic mouse melanoma model was selected since metastatic melanoma has been successfully targeted by checkpoint inhibitors in the clinic. TADM inhibited the growth of B16 mouse melanoma tumours at levels comparable to an anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody. TADM&#8208;treated tumours encompassed significantly more apoptotic cells as measured by TUNEL staining, and interferon&#8208;gamma (IFN&#8208;&#947;) expression was increased in the spleens of TADM&#8208;treated mice compared to untreated controls. TADM&#8208;treated mice also demonstrated increased Ly6&#8197;C low monocytes and neutrophils in the spleens. However, TADM&#8208;treated tumours showed no discernible differences in infiltrating immune cells. TADM can alone suppress the growth of melanoma tumours. TADM likely activates M1 type macrophages, type N1 neutrophils, and CD8+ and Th1 T cells, suppressing the type 2 immune response milieu of melanoma tumour with a strong type 1 immune response.

         <title>Structural Basis of the Dehydratase Module (hDH) of Human Fatty Acid Synthase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dehydratase module (hDH) of human fatty acid synthase (hFASN) catalyses the dehydration of &#946;&#8208;hydroxyacyl&#8208;substrate covalently carried by ACP module for fatty acid chain biosynthesis. We determined the crystal structure of hDH, and demonstrated that hDH preferentially catalyzes short chain substrates by using a single L&#8208;shaped hydrophobic tunnel in the pseudo&#8208;dimeric organization, which may facilitate subsequent therapeutical drug development.







Abstract
The human fatty acid synthase (hFASN) produces fatty acids for cellar membrane construction, energy storage, biomolecule modifications and signal transduction. Abnormal expression and functions of hFASN highly associate with numerous human diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cancers, and thereby it has been considered as a valuable potential drug target. So far, the structural and catalytic mechanisms of most of the hFASN enzymatic modules have been extensively studied, except the key dehydratase module (hDH). Here we presented the enzymatic characterization and the high&#8208;resolution crystal structure of hDH. We demonstrated that the hDH preferentially catalyzes the acyl substrates with short lengths between 4 to 8&#8208;carbons, and exhibits much lower enzymatic activity on longer substrates. Subsequent structural study showed that hDH displays a pseudo&#8208;dimeric organization with a single L&#8208;shaped composite hydrophobic catalytic tunnel as well as an atypical ACP binding site nearby, indicating that hDH achieves distinct substrate recognition and dehydration mechanisms compared to the conventional bacterial fatty acid dehydratases identified. Our findings laid the foundation for understanding the biological and pathogenic functions of hFASN, and may facilitate therapeutical drug development against diseases with abnormal functionality of hFASN.

         <title>Short Oligourea Foldamers as N&#8208; or C&#8208;Caps for Promoting &#945;&#8208;Helix Formation in Water</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Locked at either end: The high helix propensity of short oligourea sequences allows efficient capping at both the N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminus of water&#8208;soluble peptide sequences. This extra&#8208;helical stabilization is a versatile tool for modulating the conformation of bioactive peptides.

While foldamers have been extensively studied as protein mimics and especially as &#945;&#8208;helix mimics, their use as capping motif to enhance &#945;&#8208;helix propensity remains comparatively much limited. In this study, we leverage the structural similarities between urea&#8208;based helical foldamers and &#945;&#8208;helix to investigate the efficacy of oligoureas as N&#8208; or C&#8208;caps for reinforcing &#945;&#8208;helical structures in water. Short oligoureas, comprising 3 to 4 residues, were strategically introduced at the N&#8208; or C&#8208;terminus of two peptide sequences (S&#8208;peptide and an Ala&#8208;rich model sequence). The impact of these foldamer insertions on peptide conformation was examined using electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and solution NMR. This research identifies specific foldamer sequences capable of promoting &#945;&#8208;helicity when incorporated at either terminus of the peptides. Not only does this work broaden the application scope of foldamers, but it also provides valuable insights into novel strategies for modulating peptide conformation in aqueous environments. The findings presented in this study may have implications for peptide design and the development of bioactive foldamer&#8208;based peptide mimics.

&lt;p&gt;Locked at either end: The high helix propensity of short oligourea sequences allows efficient capping at both the N- and C-terminus of water-soluble peptide sequences. This extra-helical stabilization is a versatile tool for modulating the conformation of bioactive peptides.

         <title>Phosphorylation of the HMGN1 nucleosome binding domain decreases helicity and interactions with the acidic patch.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intrinsically disordered proteins are abundant in the nucleus and are prime sites for posttranslational modifications that modulate transcriptional regulation. Lacking a defined three&#8208;dimensional structure, intrinsically disordered proteins populate an ensemble of several conformational states, which are dynamic and often altered by posttranslational modifications, or by binding to interaction partners. Although there is growing appreciation for the role that intrinsically disordered regions have in regulating protein&#8208;protein interactions, we still have a poor understanding of how to determine conformational population shifts, their causes under various conditions, and how to represent and model conformational ensembles. Here, we study the effects of serine phosphorylation in the nucleosome&#8208;binding domain of an intrinsically disordered protein &#8211; HMGN1 &#8211; using NMR spectroscopy, circular dichroism and modelling of protein complexes. We show that phosphorylation induces local conformational changes in the peptide backbone and decreases the helical propensity of the nucleosome binding domain. Modelling studies using AlphaFold3 suggest that phosphorylation disrupts the interface between HMGN1 and the nucleosome acidic patch, but that the models over&#8208;predict helicity in comparison to experimental data. These studies help us to build a picture of how posttranslational modifications might shift the conformational populations of disordered regions, alter access to histones, and regulate chromatin compaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Activated Substrates for Enhancing Activatable Cyclopropene Bioorthogonal Reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal chemistry has become a mainstay in chemical biology and is making inroads in the clinic with recent advances in protein targeting and drug release. Since the field&#8217;s beginning, a major focus has been on designing bioorthogonal reagents with good selectivity, reactivity, and stability in complex biological environments. More recently, chemists have imbued reagents with new functionalities like click&#8208;and&#8208;release or light/enzyme&#8208;controllable reactivity. We have previously developed a controllable cyclopropene&#8208;based bioorthogonal ligation, which has excellent stability in physiological conditions and can be triggered to react with tetrazines by exposure to enzymes, biologically significant small molecules, or light spanning the visual spectrum. Here, to improve reactivity and gain a better understanding of this system, we screened diene reaction partners for the cyclopropene. We found that a cyclopropene&#8211;quinone pair is 26 times faster than reactions with 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazines. Additionally, we showed that the reaction of the cyclopropene&#8211;quinone pair can be activated by two orthogonal mechanisms, caging group removal on the cyclopropene and oxidation/reduction of the quinone. Finally, we demonstrated that this caged cyclopropene&#8211;quinone can be used as a bioorthogonal imaging tool to label the membranes of fixed, cultured cells.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Organ&#8208;On&#8208;a&#8208;Chip (OOC) is a multichannel 3D&#8208;microfluidic cell&#8208;culture system included in a chip that stimulates the behavior of an organ. This technology relies on a multidisciplinary science benefiting from and helping in the progress of many fields including microbiology, microfluidics, biomaterials, and bioengineering. This review article summarizes the progress and achievements of various organ&#8208;on&#8208;chip technologies. It highlights the significant advantages of this technology in terms of reducing animal testing and providing personalized medical responses. In addition, this paper demonstrates how OOC is becoming a promising and powerful tool in pharmaceutical research to combat diseases. It predicts not only the effects of drugs on the target organs but also, using body&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems, it may provide insights into the side effects of the drug delivery on the other organs. Likewise, the models used for the construction of various organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip are investigated along with the design and materials of microfluidic devices. For each OOC, the integrated monitoring devices within the chips (e.g., sensors and biosensors) are discussed. We also discussed the evolution of FDA regulations and the potential in the near future for integrating OOCs in protocols approval that support and reduce the need and the failure rates in preclinical and clinical studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Semi&#8208;Synthesis of Alpha&#8208;Synuclein: Insight into the Chemical Complexity of Synucleinopathies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alpha&#8208;synuclein (aSyn) physiologically is involved in neurotransmitter release, but pathologically aggregates into proteinaceous deposits in the brain, being associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Herein, the various reported synthetic and semi&#8208;synthetic routes to obtain wild&#8208;type (WT) and modified aSyn are summarized in order to enlighten their importance for studying the effects of modifications on the structure and aggregation behavior of aSyn.







Abstract
The chemical rules governing protein folding have intrigued generations of researchers for decades. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), prediction of protein structure has improved tremendously. However, there is still a level of analysis that is only possible through wet laboratory experiments, especially in respect to the investigation of the pathological effect of mutations and posttranslational modifications (PTMs) on proteins of interest. This requires the availability of pure peptides and proteins in sufficient quantities for biophysical, biochemical, and functional studies. In this context, chemical protein synthesis and semi&#8208;synthesis are powerful tools in protein research, which help to enlighten the role of protein modification in the physiology and pathology of proteins. A protein of high interest in the field of biomedicine is alpha&#8208;synuclein (aSyn), a protein deeply associated with several devastating neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), or multiple systems atrophy (MSA). Here, we describe several methods and pathways to synthesize native or modified aSyn, and discuss how these approaches enable us to address pathological mechanisms that may open novel perspectives for therapeutic intervention.

         <title>Targeting New Functions and Applications of Bacterial Two&#8208;Component Systems</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;component signal transduction systems (TCSs) are widespread in bacteria, and crucial for their cellular processes. This concept paper focuses on His&#8208;Asp phosphotransfer, the function of ATP synthesis, antimicrobial drug design, cellular biosensors, and protein allostery mechanisms based on recent TCS investigations, aiming to inspire new applications and future research directions.







Abstract
Two&#8208;component signal transduction systems (TCSs) are regulatory systems widely distributed in eubacteria, archaea, and a few eukaryotic organisms, but not in mammalian cells. A typical TCS consists of a histidine kinase and a response regulator protein. Functional and mechanistic studies on different TCSs have greatly advanced the understanding of cellular phosphotransfer signal transduction mechanisms. In this concept paper, we focus on the His&#8208;Asp phosphotransfer mechanism, the ATP synthesis function, antimicrobial drug design, cellular biosensors design, and protein allostery mechanisms based on recent TCS investigations to inspire new applications and future research perspectives.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled BODIPY@Au Core&#8208;Shell Structures for Durable Neuroprotective Phototherapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>BODIPY analogs are promising photosensitizers for molecular phototherapy; however, they exhibit high dark cytotoxicity and limited singlet oxygen generation capacity. In this study, we developed self&#8208;assembled core&#8208;shell nanophotosensitizers by linking a bipyridine group to BODIPY (Bpy&#8208;BODIPY) and promoting J&#8208;aggregation on gold nanourchins. This design enhances photostability and reduces the energy gap between the lowest singlet excited state and the lower triplet state, facilitating efficient singlet oxygen production. Notably, Bpy&#8208;BODIPY@Au significantly suppresses tau protein aggregation and enhances neuroprotective action, even in the presence of a phosphatase inhibitor. This work broadens the application of BODIPY chemistry to nanoagents for neuroprotective therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bifunctional Methyltransferase in Biosynthesis of Antitumor Antibiotic Streptonigrin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
StnQ2 was biochemically characterized to be a bifunctional methyltransferase that can catalyze both the methylation of a hydroxyl group and a carboxyl group. This work deepens our understanding of the methyltransferase, laying the groundwork for the elucidation of the complete biosynthesis pathway of streptonigrin.







Abstract
Streptonigrin (STN, 1) is a highly functionalized aminoquinone alkaloid antibiotic with broad and potent antitumor activity. STN structurally contains four methyl groups belonging to two types: C&#8208;methyl group and O&#8208;methyl groups. Here, we report the biochemical characterization of the O&#8208;methyltransferase StnQ2 that can catalyze both the methylation of a hydroxyl group and a carboxyl group in the biosynthesis of streptonigrin. This work not only provides a new insight into methyltransferases, but also advances the elucidation of the complete biosynthetic pathway of streptonigrin.

         <title>Broadening The Substrate Scope of Aldolases Through Metagenomic Enzyme Discovery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequence&#8208;based metagenomic approach was used to analyse ten metagenomes and extract putative DERA aldolases with unprecedented activity. We characterized the most promising enzyme by investigating its stability and activity under different conditions including temperature, pH and buffer type. Lastly, these enzymes were tested using furfural and benzaldehyde as acceptors, broadening the substrate scope of this class.







Abstract
Bio&#8208;processes based on enzymatic catalysis play a major role in the development of green, sustainable processes, and the discovery of new enzymes is key to this approach. In this work, we analysed ten metagenomes and retrieved 48 genes coding for deoxyribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate aldolases (DERAs, EC 4.1.2.4) using a sequence&#8208;based approach. These sequences were recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli and screened for activity towards a range of aldol additions. Among these, one enzyme, DERA&#8208;61, proved to be particularly interesting and catalysed the aldol addition of furfural or benzaldehyde with acetone, butanone and cyclobutanone with unprecedented activity. The product of these reactions, aldols, can find applications as building blocks in the synthesis of biologically active compounds. Screening was carried out to identify optimized reaction conditions targeting temperature, pH, and salt concentrations. Lastly, the kinetics and the stereochemistry of the products were investigated, revealing that DERA&#8208;61 and other metagenomic DERAs have superior activity and stereoselectivity when they are provided with non&#8208;natural substrates, compared to well&#8208;known DERAs.

         <title>Accessing Active Fragments for Drug Discovery Utilising Nitroreductase Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Holder et&#8197;al. show a promiscuous nitroreductase biocatalyst can afford access to a panel of functionally diverse aniline fragments. These have been shown to be active in biological assays, offering a route to a biocatalysis&#8208;derived fragment space for novel bioactive molecules.







Abstract
Biocatalysis has played a limited role in the early stages of drug discovery. This is often attributed to the limited substrate scope of enzymes not affording access to vast areas of novel chemical space. Here, we have shown a promiscuous nitroreductase enzyme (NR&#8208;55) can be used to produce a panel of functionalised anilines from a diverse panel of aryl nitro starting materials. After screening on analytical scale, we show that sixteen substrates could be scaled to 1&#8197;mmol scale, with several poly&#8208;functional anilines afforded with ease under the standard conditions. The aniline products were also screened for activity against several cell lines of interest, with modest activity observed for one compound. This study demonstrates the potential for nitroreductase biocatalysis to provide access to functional fragments under benign conditions.

         <title>Evaluation of the Stereochemistry of Staphyloferrin A for Developing Staphylococcus&#8208;Specific Targeting Conjugates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Among several structural factors of siderophore staphyloferrin A (SA), the stereochemistry of the amino acid backbone is essential for efficiently targeting Staphylococci. Utilizing the observed stereochemistry&#8208;labeling relationship, several SA&#8208;fluorophore conjugates were developed to achieve Staphylococcus&#8208;specific targeting and labeling.







Abstract
Bacteria in the genus Staphylococcus are pathogenic and harmful to humans. Alarmingly, some Staphylococcus, such as methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (VRSA) have spread worldwide and become notoriously resistant to antibiotics, threatening and concerning public health. Hence, the development of new Staphylococcus&#8208;targeting diagnostic and therapeutic agents is urgent. Here, we chose the S. aureus&#8208;secreted siderophore staphyloferrin A (SA) as a guiding unit. We developed a series of Staphyloferrin A conjugates (SA conjugates) and showed the specific targeting ability to Staphylococcus bacteria. Furthermore, among the structural factors we evaluated, the stereo&#8208;chemistry of the amino acid backbone of SA conjugates is essential to efficiently target Staphylococci. Finally, we demonstrated that fluorescent Staphyloferrin A probes (SA&#8208;FL probes) could specifically target Staphylococci in complex bacterial mixtures.

         <title>Proximity&#8208;Dependent Activation of Split DNAzyme Kinase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proximity&#8208;dependent activation of split DNAzyme kinase with DNA phosphorylating activity (termed ProxSDK) was developed. When two independent fragments of the split DNAzyme kinase recognize and bind the same target molecule, the ends of their enzyme and substrate portions come sufficiently close to allow DNA phosphorylation.







Abstract
Binary (also known as split) nucleic acid enzymes have emerged as novel tools in biosensors. We report a new split strategy to split the DNAzyme kinase into two independent and non&#8208;functional fragments, denoted Dk1sub and Dk1enz. In the presence of the specific target, their free ends are brought sufficiently close to interact with each other without the formation of Watson&#8208;Crick base pairings between Dk1sub and Dk1enz, thus allowing the DNA phosphorylation reaction. We term this approach proximity&#8208;dependent activation of split DNAzyme kinase (ProxSDK). The utility of ProxSDK is demonstrated by engineering a biosensing system that is capable of measuring specific DNA&#8208;protein interactions. We envision that the approach described herein will find useful applications in biosensing, imaging, and clinical diagnosis.

         <title>Photoactivated Anticancer Activity of Cobalt(III) Complexes with Naturally Occurring Flavonoids Chrysin and Silibinin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mixed&#8208;ligand dipyridophenazine cobalt(III) complexes, Co5 and Co6, which incorporate the naturally occurring flavonoids chrysin and silibinin, respectively, demonstrate significant visible light&#8208;triggered cytotoxicity against HeLa cervical and A549 lung cancer cells. Importantly, these complexes exhibit only minimal toxicity to HPL1D normal lung epithelial cells, suggesting their potential utility in cancer photodynamic therapy applications.







Abstract
Photoactive metal complexes of bioessential transition metal ions with natural chelators are gaining interest as photocytotoxic agents for cancer photodynamic therapy (PDT). We report six new cobalt(III) complexes with a mixed&#8208;ligand formulation [Co(B)2(L)](ClO4)2 (Co1&#8211;Co6), where B represents a N,N&#8208;donor &#945;&#8208;diimine ligand, namely, phenanthroline (phen; Co1, Co2), dipyrido[3,2&#8208;d:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;f]quinoxaline (dpq; Co3, Co4), and dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c]phenazine (dppz; Co5, Co6), and L is the monoanionic form of the naturally occurring flavonoids chrysin (chry; Co1, Co3, Co5) and silibinin (sili; Co2, Co4, Co6). Complexes displayed a d&#8208;d absorption band within 500&#8211;700&#8197;nm and exhibited excellent dark and photostability in solution. Cytotoxicity studies indicated significant activity of Co5 and Co6 against cervical (HeLa) and lung (A549) cancer cells under visible light (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm) irradiation giving low micromolar IC50 values (2.3&#8211;3.4&#8197;&#956;M, phototoxicity index~15&#8211;30). The complexes demonstrated notably low toxicity against normal HPL1D lung epithelial cells. Flow cytometry assay revealed an apoptotic mode of cell damage triggered by the complexes when irradiated. ROS generation assay indicated the involvement of singlet oxygen species in the cell death mechanism when irradiated with light. Overall, complexes Co5 and Co6 with coordinated dipyridophenazine and flavonoid ligands are potential candidates for cancer PDT applications.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Claisen Rearrangement in a Coumarin&#8208;Caged Peptide leads to a Surprising Enzyme Hyperactivation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein phosphatase&#8208;1 (PP1) is a ubiquitous enzyme counteracting hundreds of kinases in cells. PP1 interacts with regulatory proteins via an RVxF peptide motif that binds to a hydrophobic groove on the enzyme. PP1&#8208;disrupting peptides (PDPs) compete with these regulatory proteins, leading to the release of the active PP1 subunit and promoting substrate dephosphorylation. Building on previous strategies employing the ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl (o&#8208;Nb) group, we introduced coumarin derivatives into a PDP via an ether bond to explore their effects on PP1 activity. Surprisingly, our study revealed that the coumarin&#8208;caged peptides (PDP&#8208;DEACM and PDP&#8208;CM) underwent a photo&#8208;Claisen rearrangement, resulting in an unexpected hyperactivation of PP1. Our findings underscore the importance of linker design in controlling uncaging efficiency and highlight the need for comprehensive in vitro analysis before cellular experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>SMALL MOLECULE INDUCES TIME&#8208;DEPENDENT INHIBITION OF STAT3 DIMERIZATION AND DNA&#8208;BINDING ACTIVITY AND REGRESSES HUMAN BREAST TUMOR XENOGRAFTS</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aberrantly&#8208;active signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)3 has a causal role in many human cancers and represents a validated anticancer drug target, though it has posed significant challenge to drug development. A new small molecule, JKB887, was identified through virtual library screening and is predicted to interact with Lys591, Arg609 and Pro63 in the phospho&#8208;tyrosine (pTyr)&#8208;binding pocket of the Stat3 SH2 domain. JKB887 inhibited Stat3 DNA&#8208;binding activity in vitro in a time&#8208;dependent manner, with IC50 of 2.2&#8208;4.5 &#181;M at 30&#8208;60&#8208;min incubation. It directly disrupted both the Stat3 binding to the cognate, high&#8208;affinity pTyr (pY) peptide, GpYLPQTV&#8208;NH2 in fluorescent polarization assay with IC50 of 3.5&#8208;5.5 &#181;M at 60&#8208;90&#8208;min incubation, and to the IL&#8208;6 receptor/gp130 or Src in treated malignant cells. Treatment with JKB887 selectively blocked constitutive Stat3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity, Stat3&#8208;regulated gene expression, and decreased viable cell numbers, cell growth, colony formation, migration, and survival in human or mouse tumor cells. By contrast, JKB887 had minimal effects on Stat1 activity, pErk1/2MAPK, pShc, pJAK2, pSrc induction, or cells that do not harbor aberrantly&#8208;active Stat3. Additionally, JKB887 inhibited growth of human breast cancer xenografts in mice. JKB887 is a Stat3&#8208;selective inhibitor with demonstrable antitumor effects against Stat3&#8208;dependent human cancers.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping Endocytic Vesicular Acidification with a pH&#8208;Responsive DNA Nanomachine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mapping the endocytic vesicular acidification process is of prior importance to better understand the health and pathological processes of cells. Herein, by integrating a pH&#8208;sensitive i&#8208;motif and a pair of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) into a tetrahedral DNA framework (TDF), we develop a pH&#8208;responsive DNA nanomachine, allowing for efficient sensing of pH from 7.0 to 5.5 via the pH&#8208;triggered spatial proximity modulation of FRET. The inheriting endo&#8208;lysosome&#8208;targeting ability of TDF enables spatiotemporal tracking of endocytic vesicle acidification during the endosomal maturation process. Analysis of pH&#8208;dependent FRET response at single fluorescent spot level reveals the significant difference of endocytic vesicular acidification between normal and cancer cells. The performance of pH&#8208;responsive DNA nanomachine underlines its potential for studies on vesicle acidification&#8208;related pathologies as a universal platform.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Modification of Insulin Using Flow Chemistry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical modification of proteins is of growing importance to generate new molecular probes for chemical biology and for the development of new biopharmaceuticals. For example, two approved, long&#8208;acting insulin variants are lipidated at the LysB29 side&#8208;chain. Acylations of proteins have so far been performed in batch&#8208;mode. Here we describe the use of flow chemistry for site&#8208;selective acylation of a small protein, insulin. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report on flow chemistry for chemical modification of insulin. The first step was to develop reaction conditions for acylation of Lys B29 that gave a soluble mixture and thus was compatible with flow chemistry in a microreactor; this included selection of a soluble base. Secondly, the conditions, such as reagent ratios and flow rate were optimized. Third, the use of these conditions for the acylation with a wide range of acids was demonstrated. Finally, Boc&#8208;protected insulins were synthesized. Insulin remained stable towards these flow chemistry conditions. This use of flow chemistry for the chemical modification of insulin opens the prospect of producing chemically modified biopharmaceuticals by flow chemistry with fewer byproducts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Platinum (Pt) nanozymes with multiple intrinsic enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities have attracted extensive attention in biomedical fields due to their high catalytic activity, ease of modification, and convenient storage. However, the Pt nanozymes synthesized by the traditional method often suffer from uncontrollable morphology and poor stability under physicochemical conditions, resulting in unsatisfactory catalytic behavior in practical applications. To optimize the catalytic ability, biological templates have been introduced recently, which can guide the deposition of platinum ions on their surface to form specific morphologies and then stabilize the resulting Pt nanozymes. Given the promising potential of biotemplated Pt nanozymes in practical applications, it is essential to conduct a systematic and comprehensive review to summarize their recent research progress. In this review, we first categorize&#160;the biological templates and discussed the mechanisms as well as characteristics of each type of biotemplate in directing the growth of Pt nanozyme. Factors that impact the growth of biotemplated Pt nanozymes are then analyzed, followed by summarizing their biomedical application. Finally, the challenges and opportunities in this field are outlined. This review article aims to provide theoretical guidance for developing Pt nanozymes with robust functionalities in biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Biocatalysts into Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Disentangling the Roles of Affinity, Molecular Weight, and Size</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of biocatalysts within metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is attracting growing interest due to its potential to both enhance biocatalyst stability and sustain biocatalyst activity in organic solvents. However, the factors that facilitate the post&#8208;synthetic infiltration of such large molecules into MOF pores remain unclear. This systematic study enabled the identification of the influence of biocatalyst molecular size, molecular weight and affinity on the uptake by an archetypal MOF, NU&#8208;1000. We analyzed a range of six biocatalysts with molecular weights from 1.9 kDa to 44.4 kDa, respectively. By employing a combination of fluorescence tagging and 3D&#8208;STED confocal laser scanning microscopy, we distinguished between biocatalysts that were internalized within the MOF pores and those sterically excluded. The catalytic functions of the biocatalysts hosted within the MOF were investigated and found to show strong variations relative to the solvated case, ranging from a two&#8208;fold increase to a strong decrease.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrophobic domain modulation of chemical responsiveness in a bolaamphiphile&#8208;based supramolecular monomer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;immolative chemistries that respond in an irreversible manner to external stimuli are highly attractive to permanently degrade filamentous supramolecular biomaterials. Within the monomer, a balance needs to be struck between its capacity to be supramolecularly polymerized and degraded at an appropriate rate for a given application. Herein, we unravel the structure&#8208;property&#8208;function relationships of a library of squaramide&#8208;based bolaamphiphiles bearing a central disulfide&#8208;based self&#8208;immolative spacer to construct supramolecular polymers responsive to a chemical stimulus in aqueous solutions. We examine the impact of changing the alkyl domain length (2 to 12 methylene units) on the formation of supramolecular filaments and their rate of degradation in response to a biological antioxidant, glutathione. A minimum of an octyl spacer is required to robustly form supramolecular polymers that can be irreversibly degraded through a cyclization&#8208;elimination reaction of the self&#8208;immolative spacer triggered by thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange within several hours. Further increasing the peripheral alkyl chain length to a decyl spacer increases the ordered packing of the amphiphiles, hindering their chemical degradation. This study provides a framework to design small molecule chemically responsive filamentous supramolecular polymers based on bolaamphiphilic monomers that can be irreversibly degraded in aqueous solutions for their eventual application as biomedical materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dual Bispecific Hydrolysis Peptide&#8208;Drug Conjugate Responsive to Micro&#8208;Acidic and Reduction Circumstance Promotes Antitumor Efficacy in Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bispecific hydrolysis PAP&#8208;SS&#8208;PTX prodrug is synthesized by conjugating PTX into PAP peptide via disulfide and ester bonds. The prodrug could release active drug molecule (PTX) under co&#8208;stimulation with low pH and reduction circumstance and reduce the levels of histone methylations and CDK4/6 which lead to suppress tumor growth in&#8197;vitro. Meanwhile, the prodrug had potential in antitumor efficacy for triple&#8208;negative breast cancer as well as prolonged survival time in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Paclitaxel and its derivates are the first&#8208;line chemotherapeutic agents of breast cancer, which also showed tremendous clinical value in many other diseases including ovarian cancer, lung cancer etc. However, there are many drawbacks for almost all paclitaxel or its derivates, including extremely short half&#8208;life, poor solubility and adverse events, which significantly limits their clinical applications. In this work, we designed and constructed a bispecific hydrolysis PAP&#8208;SS&#8208;PTX (term as PDC), consisting with pro&#8208;apoptosis peptide (PAP) and paclitaxel (PTX) that were conjugated together via disulfide and ester bonds. On the one hand, PAP could improve the solubility of PTX and promote cellular uptake for drugs. On the other hand, it was able to prolong the PTX half&#8208;life. We performed series of chemo&#8208;dynamical assays and showed that PDC would release active drug molecules under micro&#8208;acidic and reduction circumstance. The further assays elucidated that PDC could interrupt DNA synthesis and arrest cell division through downregulating CDK4/6 and Histone methylation that inhibit tumor growth in&#8197;vitro. What's more, it could not only inhibit 4T1 breast tumor growth, but also prolong the survival time of mice and exert antitumor efficacy in&#8197;vivo. It may provide a new research idea for cancer therapies via controlled release strategy in tumor microenvironment.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Targeting of the HER2 Cancer Receptor with an Antibody&#8208;Directed Enzyme and a Nanobody&#8208;Guided MMAE Prodrug Scaffold</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced dual&#8208;targeting antibody&#8208;directed enzyme prodrug therapy (DuADEPT) system is developed. An antibody&#8208;enzyme conjugate and an enzymatically activated prodrug scaffold based on artificial oligonucleotides are directed to two proximal epitopes of a cancer&#8208;specific receptor. Drug release, dual&#8208;targeting, and ligand&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity are investigated in human cancer cells.







Abstract
Antibody&#8208;enzyme conjugates have shown potential as tissue&#8208;specific prodrug activators by antibody&#8208;directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT), but the approach met challenges clinically due to systemic drug release. Here, we report a novel dual&#8208;targeting ADEPT system (DuADEPT) which is based on active cancer receptor targeting of both a trastuzumab&#8208;sialidase conjugate (Tz&#8208;Sia) and a highly potent sialidase&#8208;activated monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) prodrug scaffold. The scaffold is based on a four&#8208;way junction of the artificial nucleic acid analog acyclic (L)&#8208;threoninol nucleic acid ((L)&#8208;aTNA) which at the ends of its four arms carries one nanobody targeting HER2 and three copies of the prodrug. Dual&#8208;targeting of the constructs to two proximal epitopes of HER2 was shown by flow cytometry, and a dual&#8208;targeted enzymatic drug release assay revealed cytotoxicity upon prodrug activation specifically for HER2&#8208;positive cancer cells. The specific delivery and activation of prodrugs in this way could potentially be used to decrease systemic side effects and increase drug efficacy, and utilization of Tz&#8208;Sia provides an opportunity to combine the local chemotherapeutic effect of the DuADEPT with an anticancer immune response.

         <title>Expanding the repertoire of ceDAF&#8208;12 ligands for modulation of the steroid endocrine system in C. elegans.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Steroid hormones are essential for the biological processes of eukaryotic organisms. The steroid endocrine system of C. elegans, which includes dafachronic acids (DA) and the nuclear receptor ceDAF&#8208;12, provides a simple model for exploring the role of steroid hormone signaling pathways in animals. In this study, we show for the first time the feasibility of designing synthetic steroids that can modulate different physiological processes, such as development, reproduction and ageing, in relation to ceDAF&#8208;12. Our results not only confirm the conclusions derived from genetic studies linking these processes but also provide new chemical tools to selectively manipulate them, as we found that different compounds produce different phenotypic results. The structures of these compounds are much more diverse than those of endogenous hormones and analogues previously described by other researchers, allowing further development of the chemical modulation of the steroid endocrine system in C. elegans and related nematodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Allosteric Effects of EF&#8208;G Domain I Mutations Inducing Ribosome Frameshifting Revealed by Multiplexed Force Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Description: We report ribosome translocation studies with single&#8208;nucleotide resolution on both ends of the mRNA, using the newly invented multiplexed force spectroscopy technique. The high&#8208;resolution results revealed that the specifically engineered elongation factor G induced frameshifting in contrast to the wild type.







Abstract
Ribosome translocation catalyzed by elongation factor G (EF&#8208;G) is a critical step in protein synthesis where the ribosome typically moves along the mRNA by three nucleotides at each step. To investigate the mechanism of EF&#8208;G catalysis, it is essential to precisely resolve the ribosome motion at both ends of the mRNA, which, to our best knowledge, is only achieved with the magnetic&#8208;based force spectroscopy developed by our groups. Here, we introduce a novel multiplexed force spectroscopy technique that, for the first time, offers single&#8208;nucleotide resolution for multiple samples. This technique combines multiple acoustic force generators with the smallest atomic magnetometer designed for biological research. Utilizing this technique, we demonstrate that mutating EF&#8208;G at the GTP binding pocket results in the ribosome moving only two nucleotides on both ends of the mRNA, thereby compromising ribosome translocation. This finding suggests a direct link between GTP hydrolysis and ribosome translocation. Our results not only provide mechanistic insights into the role of GTP binding pocket but also illuminate how allosteric mutations can manipulate translocation. We anticipate broader applications of our technique in the ribosome field, leveraging its high efficiency and single&#8208;nucleotide resolution.

         <title>Tumor Acidity&#8208;Triggered Bioorthogonal Reactions for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor acidity and bioorthogonal reactions have been widely utilized in tumor diagnosis and therapy over the past years. Herein, we provide an overview of the concept and major strategies of tumor acidity&#8208;triggered bioorthogonal reactions. In addition, recent updates in the development of tumor acidity&#8208;triggered bioorthogonal reactions exhibit notable promise for bioimaging and therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Cancer is one of the most serious threats to human health. Over the past few years, researchers have incrementally uncovered the pivotal role of tumor acidity in tumor formation, development, and treatment. In addition, bioorthogonal reactions have been widely used in tumor diagnosis and therapy, owing to their advantageous characteristics, including small ligand size, biocompatibility, fast reaction kinetics, and high chemospecificity. Consequently, bioorthogonal reactions triggered by tumor acidity have become an emerging strategy in biomedical applications. On this basis, we first elucidate the concept and major strategies of tumor acidity&#8208;triggered bioorthogonal reactions. Additionally, we review the progress in biomedical applications, with a particular focus on their importance in disease diagnosis and treatment. Finally, clinical challenges and future trends are also outlooked.

         <title>99mTc(I)&#8208;Labeled His&#8208;Tagged Proteins: Impact in the Development of Novel Imaging Probes and in Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Technetium&#8208;99m (99mTc) remains the cornerstone of nuclear medicine for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) due to its widespread availability and chemical and physical features. Its multiple oxidation states allow for the design and production of radiopharmaceuticals with versatile properties, namely in terms of pharmacokinetic profile. 99mTc(V) is the most common oxidation state, but 99mTc(I) gained traction after the pioneering work of Alberto and colleagues, which resulted in the introduction of the organometallic core fac&#8208;[99mTc(CO)3(H2O)3]+. This core is readily available from [99mTcO4]&#8208; and displays three labile water molecules that can be easily swapped for ligands with different denticity and/or donor atoms in aqueous environment. This makes it possible to radiolabel small molecules as well as high molecular weight molecules, such as antibodies or other proteins, while assuring biological activity. Direct radiolabelling of those proteins with fac&#8208;[99mTc(CO)3]+ under mild conditions is accomplished through incorporation of a polyhistidine tag (His&#8208;tag), a commonly used tag for purification of recombinant proteins. This review aims to address the direct radiolabelling of His&#8208;tagged macromolecules with fac&#8208;[99mTc(CO)3]+ for development of molecular imaging agents and the impact of this technology in the discovery and development of imaging and/or therapeutic agents towards clinical application.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridging the Gap in the Structure&#8211;Function Paradigm of Enzymatic PET Degradation &#8211; Aromatic Residue Driven Balanced Interactions with Catalytic and Anchoring Subsite</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding all parameters contributing to enzyme activity is crucial in enzyme
catalysis. For enzymatic PET degradation, this involves examining the formation of the
enzyme&#8208;PET complex. In IsPETase (WT), a PET&#8208;degrading enzyme from
Ideonellasakaiensis, mutating two non&#8208;catalytic residues (DM) significantly enhances
activity. Such mutations, depending on their position in the tertiary structure, fine&#8208;tune
enzyme function. However, detailed molecular insights into these mutations' structurefunction
relationship for PET degradation are lacking. This study characterizes
IsPETase's catalytic ability compared to WT TfCut2 using molecular dynamics
simulations and quantum mechanical methods. We explore the conformational
landscape of the enzyme&#8208;PET complex and quantify residue&#8208;wise interaction energy.
Notably, aromatic and hydrophobic residues Tyr, Trp, and Ile in the catalytic subsite
S1, and aromatic Phe and polar Asn in the anchoring subsite S3, crucially optimize
PET binding. These residues enhance PET specificity over non&#8208;aromatic plastics. Our
findings suggest that the balance between binding at subsite S1 and subsite S3, which
is influenced by cooperative mutations, underlies catalytic activity. This balance shows
a positive correlation with experimentally obtained kcat/Km values: WT TfCut2 &lt; WT
IsPETase &lt;&lt; DM IsPETase.</dc:description>

         <title>Adsorption and Distribution of Triplex&#8208;hybridizing Bioconjugated Gold Nanoclusters inside Spermatozoa&#8208; A Study using Confocal Microscopy and Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The study of the interactions between biofunctionalized gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) and spermatozoa is highly relevant to evaluate the potential of Au NCs as imaging probes and transfection agents in the reproductive biology. In this work, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to investigate the distribution of Au NCs bioconjugated with peptide (nuclear localisation sequence, NLS) and oligonucleotide (locked nucleic acid, LNA) ligands in bovine spermatozoa. Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) was employed to detect changes in the NC&#180;s chemical environment. We observed a pronounced regio&#8208;selective accumulation of the bioconjugates in spermatozoa with high concentration at the equatorial segment. Furthermore, 3D&#8208;CLSM showed successful non&#8208;endosomal cellular uptake of the conjugates by intact sperm cells and the distribution of the bioconjugates was found to be influenced by the ligand types. Interestingly, the FLIM data showed differences in lifetime depending on membrane integrity. Furthermore, ligand&#8208;dependent changes in lifetime between NC bioconjugates carrying peptide and oligonucleotide ligands were found, probably attributed to specific interactions with sperm cell compartments.</dc:description>

         <title>A Single Interfacial Point Mutation Rescues Solution Structure Determination of the Complex of HMG&#8208;D with a DNA Bulge.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Broadening of signals from atoms at interfaces can often be a limiting factor in applying solution NMR to the structure determination of complexes. Common contributors to such problems include exchange between free and bound states and the increased molecular weight of complexes relative to the free components, but another cause that can be more difficult to deal with occurs when conformational dynamics within the interface takes place at an intermediate rate on the chemical shift timescale. In this work we show how a carefully chosen mutation in the protein HMG&#8208;D rescued such a situation, making possible high&#8208;resolution structure determination of its complex with a dA2 bulge DNA ligand designed to mimic a natural DNA bend, and thereby revealing a new spatial organization of the complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Control of Nucleic Acid Function via Chemical Caging&#8208;Decaging Strategies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to precisely control the function of nucleic acids plays an important role in biosensing and biomedicine. In recent years, novel strategies employing biological, physical, and chemical triggers have been developed to modulate the function of nucleic acids spatiotemporally. These approaches commonly involve the incorporation of stimuli&#8208;responsive groups onto nucleic acids to block their functions until triggers&#8208;induced decaging restore activity. These inventive strategies deepen our comprehension of nucleic acid molecules' dynamic behavior and provide new techniques for precise disease diagnosis and treatment. Focusing on the spatiotemporal regulation of nucleic acid molecules through the chemical caging&#8208;decaging strategy, we here present an overview of the innovative triggered control mechanisms and accentuate their implications across the fields of chemical biology, biomedicine, and biosensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Uracil&#8208;Selective Cross&#8208;Linking in RNA and Inhibition of miRNA Function by 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;6&#8208;vinyl&#8208;7&#8208;deazapurine Deoxynucleosides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the synthesis of a cross&#8208;linkable nucleoside (2&#8208;amino&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;7&#8208;propynyl&#8208;6&#8208;vinylpurine deoxyriboside; dADpVP). dADpVP selectively reacted with counter uridine with high reactivity upon duplex hybridization. The structural determination of the cross&#8208;linked adduct revealed that cross&#8208;linking occurred at the N&#8208;3 of uridine. We investigated if the incorporation of cross&#8208;linking nucleosides into microRNA inhibitors enabled a more effective inhibition of endogenous miRNA function.







Abstract
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression through RNA interference. Consequently, miRNA inhibitors, such as anti&#8208;miRNA oligonucleotides (AMOs), have attracted attention for treating miRNA overexpression. To achieve efficient inhibition, we developed 2&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;vinylpurine (AVP) nucleosides that form covalent bonds with uridine counterparts in RNA. We demonstrated that mRNA cross&#8208;linked with AVP&#8208;conjugated antisense oligonucleotides with AVP were protected from gene silencing by exogenous miRNA. However, endogenous miRNA function could not be inhibited in cells, probably because of slow cross&#8208;linking kinetics. We recently developed ADpVP, an AVP derivative bearing a 7&#8208;propynyl group &#8211; which boasts faster reaction rate than the original AVP. Here, we synthesized dADpVP &#8211; a deoxy analog of ADpVP &#8211; through a simplified synthesis protocol. Evaluation of the cross&#8208;linking reaction revealed that the reaction kinetics of dADpVP were comparable to those of ADpVP. In addition, structural analysis of the cross&#8208;linked adduct discovered N3 linkage against uridine. Incorporating dADpVP into two types of miRNA inhibitors revealed a marginal impact on AMO efficacy yet improved the performance of target site blockers. These results indicate the potential of cross&#8208;linking nucleosides for indirect miRNA function inhibition.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Mediated Antibiotic Delivery to In Vivo Biofilm Infections: A Review</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacterial biofilms pose a significant clinical challenge because they are highly resistant to host immune responses and antibiotic treatments. This review delves into the reasons behind the difficulty in treating biofilms and investigates the potential of ultrasound&#8208;mediated drug delivery as a method to address various in vivo biofilm infections.







Abstract
Bacterial biofilms are a significant concern in various medical contexts due to their resilience to our immune system as well as antibiotic therapy. Biofilms often require surgical removal and frequently lead to recurrent or chronic infections. Therefore, there is an urgent need for improved strategies to treat biofilm infections. Ultrasound&#8208;mediated drug delivery is a technique that combines ultrasound application, often with the administration of acoustically&#8208;active agents, to enhance drug delivery to specific target tissues or cells within the body. This method involves using ultrasound waves to assist in the transportation or activation of medications, improving their penetration, distribution, and efficacy at the desired site. The advantages of ultrasound&#8208;mediated drug delivery include targeted and localized delivery, reduced systemic side effects, and improved efficacy of the drug at lower doses. This review scrutinizes recent advances in the application of ultrasound&#8208;mediated drug delivery for treating biofilm infections, focusing on in vivo studies. We examine the strengths and limitations of this technology in the context of wound infections, device&#8208;associated infections, lung infections and abscesses, and discuss current gaps in knowledge and clinical translation considerations.

         <title>Ubiquitin&#8217;s conformational heterogeneity as discerned by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visualizing a protein&#8217;s molecular motions has been a long standing topic of research in the biophysics community. Largely this has been done by exploiting nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and arguably no protein&#8217;s molecular motions have been better characterized by NMR than that of ubiquitin (Ub), a 76 amino acid polypeptide essential in ubiquitination &#8208; a key regulatory system within cells. Herein, we discuss ubiquitin&#8217;s conformational plasticity as visualized, at atomic resolution, by more than 35 years of NMR work. In our discussions we point out the differences between data acquired in vitro, ex vivo, as well as in vivo and stress the need to investigate Ub&#8217;s conformational plasticity in more biologically representative backgrounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation and Molecular Characterization of the LTA precursor molecule Glc2&#8208;DAG, a potential target for antibiotics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial infections present a major global health threat, often displaying resistance to various antibiotics. Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is a vital component of bacterial cell envelopes of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, crucial for cell integrity, cell division, and host inflammation. Due to its essential role for bacteria, LTA and its biosynthesis are also attractive drug targets, however, there is only scant molecular knowledge on LTA and its precursor molecules in membranes. Here, we report the isolation and molecular characterization of diglucosyldiacylglycerol (Glc2&#8208;DAG), the glycolipid precursor molecule that anchors LTA in the bacterial plasma&#8208;membrane. Using a tailored growth medium and purification protocols, we isolated 13C&#8208;isotope labelled Glc2&#8208;DAG from bacteria, which can then be used for high&#8208;resolution NMR studies. Using solution&#8208;state and solid&#8208;state NMR, we show an in&#8208;depth molecular characterization of Glc2&#8208;DAG, including in native&#8208;like membranes. Our approach may help to identify antibiotics that directly target LTA precursor molecules, and it offers a tool for future investigations into the role of Glc2&#8208;DAG in bacterial physiology.</dc:description>

We employed liquid chromatography (LC) and vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) to resolve for the first time, the enantiomers of ML&#8208;SA1 an agonist of the lysosomal ion channel TRPML1. Compound (S)&#8208;ML&#8208;SA1 was nearly 10&#8208;fold more potent than the racemate in the calcium assay, which lead to a strong transcription factor EB (TFEB) translocation to the nucleus, followed by gene transcription and increase in the autophagy markers.







Abstract
Autophagic flux plays a crucial role in various diseases. Recently, the lysosomal ion channel TRPML1 has emerged as a promising target in lysosomal storage diseases, such as mucolipidosis. The discovery of mucolipin synthetic agonist&#8208;1 (ML&#8208;SA1) has expanded our understanding of TRPML1&#8242;s function and its potential therapeutic uses. However, ML&#8208;SA1 is a racemate with limited cellular potency and poor water solubility. In this study, we synthetized rac&#8208;ML&#8208;SA1, separated the enantiomers by chiral liquid chromatography and determined their absolute configuration by vibrational circular dichroism (VCD). In addition, we focused on investigating the impact of each enantiomer of ML&#8208;SA1 on the TRPML1&#8208;TFEB axis. Our findings revealed that (S)&#8208;ML&#8208;SA1 acts as an agonist for TRPML1 at the lysosomal membrane. This activation prompts transcription factor EB (TFEB) to translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus in a dose&#8208;dependent manner within live cells. Consequently, this signaling pathway enhances the expression of coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation (CLEAR) genes and activates autophagic flux. Our study presents evidence for the potential use of (S)&#8208;ML&#8208;SA1 in the development of new therapies for lysosomal storage diseases that target TRPML1.

         <title>Biosynthesis and Assembly Logic of Fungal Hybrid Terpenoid Natural Products</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of terpenoid moieties with diverse building blocks of polyketides, nonribosomal peptides, amino acids, p&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid, saccharides, and adenine relies on the collaboration of terpene cyclases (TCs) or prenyltransferases (PTs) with polyketide synthases (PKSs), nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPSs), or glycosyltransferases (GTs), these combination strategies significantly contribute to the formation of hybrid terpenoid natural products in fungi.







Abstract
In recent decades, fungi have emerged as significant sources of diverse hybrid terpenoid natural products, and their biosynthetic pathways are increasingly unveiled. This review mainly focuses on elucidating the various strategies underlying the biosynthesis and assembly logic of these compounds. These pathways combine terpenoid moieties with diverse building blocks including polyketides, nonribosomal peptides, amino acids, p&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid, saccharides, and adenine, resulting in the formation of plenty of hybrid terpenoid natural products via C&#8722;O, C&#8722;C, or C&#8722;N bond linkages. Subsequent tailoring steps, such as oxidation, cyclization, and rearrangement, further enhance the biological diversity and structural complexity of these hybrid terpenoid natural products. Understanding these biosynthetic mechanisms holds promise for the discovery of novel hybrid terpenoid natural products from fungi, which will promote the development of potential drug candidates in the future.

         <title>Deciphering the effect of a Cu(II)&#8208;hydrazone complex on intracellular cell signalling pathways in a human osteosarcoma 2D and 3D models</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New therapeutic strategies for osteosarcoma (OS) have demonstrated the potential efficacy of copper compounds as anticancer drugs and as a substitute for the often used platinum compounds. OS is a type of bone cancer, primarily affecting young adults and children..The main objective of this work is to discover the molecular targets and cellular pathways related to the antitumor properties of a Cu(II)&#8208;hydrazone toward human OS &#160;2D and 3D systems. Cell viability study using MG&#8208;63 cells was evaluated in OS monolayer and spheroids. CuHL significantly reduced cell viability in OS models (IC50 2D: 2.6 &#177; 0.3 &#181;M; IC50 3D: 9.9 &#177; 1.4 &#181;M) (p&lt;0.001). Also, CuHL inhibits cell proliferation and it induces cells to apoptosis. The main mechanism of action found for CuHL are the interaction with DNA, genotoxicity, the ROS generation and the proteasome activity inhibition. Besides, 67 differentially expressed proteins were found using proteomic approaches. Of those 67 proteins, 40 were found overexpressed and 27 underexpressed. The response to stress and to unfolded protein, as well as ATP synthesis were the most affected biological process among upregulated proteins, whilst proteins related to DNA replication and redox homeostasis were downregulated.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidating Evolutionary Mechanisms and Variants of the Hammerhead Ribozyme Using In Vitro Selection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Hammerhead Ribozyme (HHR) is a ubiquitous RNA enzyme that catalyzes site&#8208;specific intramolecular cleavage. While mutations to its catalytic core have traditionally been viewed as detrimental to its activity, several discoveries of naturally occurring variants of the full&#8208;length ribozyme challenge this notion, suggesting a deeper understanding of HHR evolution and functionality. By systematically introducing mutations at key nucleotide positions within the catalytic core, we generated single&#8208;, double&#8208;, and triple&#8208;mutation libraries to explore the sequence requirements and evolution of a full&#8208;length HHR. In vitro selection revealed many novel hammerhead variants, some of which possess mutations at nucleotides previously considered to be essential. We also demonstrate that the evolutionary trajectory of each nucleotide in the catalytic core directly correlates with their functional importance, potentially giving researchers a novel method to assess the sequence requirements of functional nucleic acids.</dc:description>

         <title>New Frontiers in Nonheme Enzymatic Oxyferryl Species</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we summarize the reactivities demonstrated by S=2 oxyferryl intermediates found in non&#8208;heme mononuclear iron enzymes and the recently discovered S=1 ferryl intermediate in the same enzyme family. The mechanistic implication and the reactivity difference of the ferryl intermediates with different spin states are further discussed.







Abstract
Non&#8208;heme mononuclear iron dependent (NHM&#8722;Fe) enzymes exhibit exceedingly diverse catalytic reactivities. Despite their catalytic versatilities, the mononuclear iron centers in these enzymes show a relatively simple architecture, in which an iron atom is ligated with 2&#8211;4 amino acid residues, including histidine, aspartic or glutamic acid. In the past two decades, a common high&#8208;valent reactive iron intermediate, the S=2 oxyferryl (Fe(IV)&#8208;oxo or Fe(IV)=O) species, has been repeatedly discovered in NHM&#8722;Fe enzymes containing a 2&#8208;His&#8208;Fe or 2&#8208;His&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylate&#8208;Fe center. However, for 3&#8208;His/4&#8208;His&#8208;Fe enzymes, no common reactive intermediate has been identified. Recently, we have spectroscopically characterized the first S=1 Fe(IV) intermediate in a 3&#8208;His&#8208;Fe containing enzyme, OvoA, which catalyzes a novel oxidative carbon&#8208;sulfur bond formation. In this review, we summarize the broad reactivities demonstrated by S=2 Fe(IV)&#8208;oxo intermediates, the discovery of the first S=1 Fe(IV) intermediate in OvoA and the mechanistic implication of such a discovery, and the intrinsic reactivity differences of the S=2 and the S=1 Fe(IV)&#8208;oxo species. Finally, we postulate the possible reasons to utilize an S=1 Fe(IV) species in OvoA and their implications to other 3&#8208;His/4&#8208;His&#8208;Fe enzymes.

         <title>Single Point Mutation Abolishes Water Capture in Germacradien&#8208;4&#8208;ol Synthase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering water capture in sesquiterpene synthase (GdolS) is explored by manipulating highly conserved active site residues. This work demonstrates that hydroxylation in sesquiterpene synthases can be prevented resulting in the formation of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons from carbocation intermediates.







Abstract
The high&#8208;fidelity sesquiterpene cyclase (&#8722;)&#8208;germacradien&#8208;4&#8208;ol synthase (GdolS) converts farnesyl diphosphate into the macrocyclic alcohol (&#8722;)&#8208;germacradien&#8208;4&#8208;ol. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis was used to decipher the role of key residues in the water control mechanism. Replacement of Ala176, located in the G1/2 helix, with non&#8208;polar aliphatic residues of increasing size (valine, leucine, isoleucine and methionine) resulted in the accumulation of the non&#8208;hydroxylated products germacrene A and germacrene D. In contrast, hydroxylation was maintained when the polar residues threonine, glutamine or aspartate replaced Ala176. Additionally, although a contribution of His150 to the nucleophilic water addition could be ruled out, the imidazole ring of His150 appears to assist carbocation stabilisation. The results presented here shed light on how hydroxylating sesquiterpene synthases can be engineered to design modified sesquiterpene synthases to reduce the need for further steps in the biocatalytic production of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids.

         <title>Matching Together Living Cells and Prototissues: Will There Be Chemistry?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the field of tissue engineering, the combination of synthetic and living tissues could be the turning point. In this work we review examples of hybrid protocell/living cell and prototissue/living cell systems, focusing on the chemistry that makes the integration between non&#8208;living and living matter efficient. We also highlight key breakthroughs in stimulus&#8208;driven tissue engineering and predict the advent of photo&#8208;mechanical interactions.







Abstract
Scientific advancements in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology have led to the development of numerous models of synthetic cells, or protocells. To date, research has mainly focused on increasing the (bio)chemical complexity of these bioinspired micro&#8208;compartmentalized systems, yet the successful integration of protocells with living cells remains one of the major challenges in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. In this review, we aim to summarize the current state of the art in hybrid protocell/living cell and prototissue/living cell systems. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in tissue engineering, we review the chemical, bio&#8208;chemical, and mechano&#8208;chemical aspects that hold promise for achieving an effective integration of non&#8208;living and living matter. The future production of fully integrated protocell/living cell systems and increasingly complex prototissue/living tissue systems not only has the potential to revolutionize the field of tissue engineering, but also paves the way for new technologies in (bio)sensing, personalized therapy, and drug delivery.

         <title>In vivo Delivery Processes and Development Strategies of Lipid Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) represent an advanced and highly efficient delivery system for RNA molecules, demonstrating exceptional biocompatibility and remarkable delivery efficiency. This is evidenced by the clinical authorization of three LNP formulations: Patisiran, BNT162b2, and mRNA&#8208;1273. To further maximize the efficacy of RNA&#8208;based therapy, it is imperative to develop more potent LNP delivery systems that can effectively protect inherently unstable and negatively charged RNA molecules from degradation by nucleases, while facilitating their cellular uptake into target cells. Therefore, this review presents feasible strategies commonly employed for the development of efficient LNP delivery systems. The strategies encompass combinatorial chemistry, a rational design approach, the derivatization strategy of functional molecules, the optimization of LNP formulations, and adjustment of particle size and charge property of LNPs. Prior to introducing these developing strategies, in vivo delivery processes of LNPs, a crucial determinant influencing the clinical translation of LNP formulations, is described to better understand how to develop LNP delivery systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical/Electrochemiluminescence Sensors Based on Vertically&#8208;Ordered Mesoporous Silica Films for Biomedical Analytical Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various construction strategies of vertically&#8208;ordered mesoporous silica films for electrochemical and electrochemiluminescence sensors and their extensive applications in biomedical analysis have been comprehensively summarized. The biomedical analytical applications focus on the detection of small biomolecules, diseases&#8208;related biomarkers, drugs and cancer cells.







Abstract
Vertically&#8208;ordered mesoporous silica films (VMSF, also named as silica isoporous membranes) have shown tremendous potential in the field of electroanalytical sensors due to their unique features in terms of controllable and ultrasmall nanopores, high molecular selectivity and permeability, and mechanical stability. This review will present the recent progress on the biomedical analytical applications of VMSF, focusing on the small biomolecules, diseases&#8208;related biomarkers, drugs and cancer cells. Finally, conclusions with recent developments and future perspective of VMSF in the relevant fields will be envisioned.

         <title>Vinyl 3&#8208;(Dimethylamino)propanoate as an Irreversible Acyl Donor Reagent in a Chromatography&#8208;free Lipase&#8208;Catalyzed Kinetic Resolution of sec&#8208;Alcohols</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel &#8220;acid&#8208;washable&#8221; acyl donor, namely vinyl 3&#8208;(dimethylamino)propanoate, dedicated to a chromatography&#8208;free lipase&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution (KR) of racemic sec&#8208;alcohols. The employed vinyl ester is easy to obtain from commercially available starting materials, allows the synthesis of both enantiomers of a range of structurally diverse benzylic alcohols with high conversions and excellent enantioselectivity, and, most importantly, significantly simplifies enzymatic KR, leading to a more sustainable and ecologically friendly bioprocess. The developed procedure can be applied when classical purification methods fail to separate KR products.







Abstract
The reported chemoenzymatic strategy involves the employment of vinyl 3&#8208;(dimethylamino)propanoate as an irreversible acyl donor in a chromatography&#8208;free lipase&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution (KR) of racemic sec&#8208;alcohols. This biotransformation is achieved in a sequential manner using CAL&#8208;B to affect the kinetic resolution, followed by a simple acidic extractive work&#8208;up furnishing both KR products with excellent enantioselectivity (E&gt;200; up to 98&#8201;% ee). The elaborated method eliminates a single&#8208;use silica gel chromatographic separation and significantly reduces organic solvent consumption to foster a more environmentally friendly chemical industry.

         <title>Retinoids Molecular Probes by Late&#8208;stage Azide Insertion &#8211; Functional Tools to Decrypt Retinoid Metabolism</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of close&#8208;to&#8208;native retinoid probes was synthesized through versatile late&#8208;stage azide insertion at the C4 position. These probes retain the ability of the original compound to activate gene transcription. Their ability to undergo in&#8197;vivo click reactions enabled the highlighting of biological activities in a zebrafish model.







Abstract
Studying the complex and intricate retinoids metabolic pathways by chemical biology approaches requires design and synthesis of biologically functional molecular probes. Only few of such molecular retinoid probes could be found in literature, most of them bearing a molecular structure quite different from natural retinoids. To provide close&#8208;to&#8208;native retinoid probes, we have developed a versatile late&#8208;stage method for the insertion of azide function at the C4 position of several retinoids. This one&#8208;step process opens straightforward access to different retinoid and carotenoid probes from commercially available precursors. We have further demonstrated that the different molecular probes retain ability of the original compound to activate genes&#8217; transcription, despite azide insertion, highlighting biological activities that were further validated in zebrafish in&#8197;vivo model. The present work paves the way to future studies on vitamin A's metabolism.

&lt;p&gt;Studying the complex and intricate retinoids metabolic pathways by chemical biology approaches requires design and synthesis of biologically functional molecular probes. Only few of such molecular retinoid probes could be found in literature, most of them bearing a molecular structure quite different from natural retinoids. To provide close-to-native retinoid probes, we have developed a versatile late-stage method for the insertion of azide function at the C4 position of several retinoids. This one-step process opens straightforward access to different retinoid and carotenoid probes from commercially available precursors. We have further demonstrated that the different molecular probes retain ability of the original compound to activate genes&#8217; transcription, despite azide insertion, highlighting biological activities that were further validated in zebrafish &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt; model. The present work paves the way to future studies on vitamin A's metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The applications of electrochemiluminescence microscopy (ECLM) for visual biosensing and bioimaging in recent years were reviewed. Some existing challenges and feasible solutions were presented aiming to provide general guidelines for broadening the research field of ECLM.







Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is one of the most powerful techniques that meet the needs of analysis and detection in a variety of scenarios, because of its highly analytical sensitivity and excellent spatiotemporal controllability. ECL combined with microscopy (ECLM) offers a promising approach for quantifying and mapping a wide range of analytes. To date, ECLM has been widely used to image biological entities and processes, such as cells, subcellular structures, proteins and membrane transport properties. In this review, we first introduced the mechanisms of several classic ECL systems, then highlighted the progress of visual biosensing and bioimaging by ECLM in the last decade. Finally, the characteristics of ECLM were summarized, as well as some of the current challenges. The future research interests and potential directions for the application of ECLM were also outlooked.

         <title>Continuous Flow Microreactors for the High&#8208;efficiency Enzymatic Synthesis of 10&#8208;Hydroxystearic Acid from Oleic Acid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Converting fatty acids into specialty chemicals is sustainable but hindered by the low efficiency and thermal instability of current oleic acid hydratases, along with mass transfer limitations in emulsion reactions. This study introduces an optimized continuous flow micro&#8208;reactor (CFMR) that efficiently transforms oleic acid at low (15 g&#183;L&#8208;1) and high (50 g&#183;L&#8208;1) concentrations, improving reaction efficiency and overcoming key conversion barriers. The first CFMR model showed reaction speeds surpassing traditional batch stirred tank reactors (BSTR). Optimizations were performed on three key components: liquid storage, mixer, and reaction section of the CFMR, with each round's best conditions carried into the next. This achieved a space&#8208;time yield of 597 g&#183;L&#8208;1&#183;d&#8208;1 at a 15 g&#183;L&#8208;1 oleic acid load. To further enhance the yield, we optimized the emulsifier system to solve incomplete emulsification and developed a two&#8208;component feed microreactor (TCFMR) that addressed substrate and product inhibition at high loads, reaching a 91% conversion of 50 g&#183;L&#8208;1 oleic acid in 30 minutes, with a space&#8208;time yield of 2312 g&#183;L&#8208;1&#183;d&#8208;1. These advancements represent significant progress in utilizing fatty acids and advancing sustainable chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances in evolved T7 RNA polymerases for expanding the frontiers of enzymatic nucleic acid synthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In vitro RNA synthesis technologies are crucial in developing therapeutic RNA drugs, such as mRNA vaccines and RNA interference (RNAi) therapies. Enzymatic RNA synthesis, recognized for its sustainability and efficiency, enables the production of extensive RNA sequences under mild conditions. Among the enzymes utilized, T7 RNA polymerase is distinguished by its exceptional catalytic efficiency, enabling the precise and rapid transcription of RNA from DNA templates by recognizing the specific T7 promoter sequence. With the advancement in clinical applications of RNA&#8208;based drugs, there is an increasing demand for the synthesis of chemically modified RNAs that are stable and resistant to nuclease degradation. To this end, researchers have applied directed evolution to broaden the enzyme's substrate scope, enhancing its compatibility with non&#8208;canonical substrates and reducing the formation of by&#8208;products. This review summarizes the progress in engineering T7 RNA polymerase for these purposes and explores prospective developments in the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Thermodynamic Evaluation of Sialyl&#8208;Tn MUC1 Glycopeptides Binding to Macrophage Galactose&#8208;Type Lectin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have synthesized cancer&#8208;associated MUC1 glycopeptide models to explore the interactions between Tn and sialyl&#8208;Tn antigens and the human MGL lectin at the molecular level. The thermodynamic profiles of the binding interactions were analyzed by ITC. Findings from this study will shed more light on human MGL's ability to regulate immune responses.







Abstract
Interactions between the tumor&#8208;associated carbohydrate antigens of Mucin 1 (MUC1) and the carbohydrate&#8208;binding proteins, lectins, often lead to the creation of a pro&#8208;tumor microenvironment favoring tumor initiation, progression, metastasis, and immune evasion. Macrophage galactose binding lectin (MGL) is a C&#8208;type lectin receptor found on antigen&#8208;presenting cells that facilitates the uptake of carbohydrate antigens for antigen presentation, modulating the immune response homeostasis, autoimmunity, and cancer. Considering the crucial role of tumor&#8208;associated forms of MUC1 and MGL in tumor immunology, a thorough understanding of their binding interaction is essential for it to be exploited for cancer vaccine strategies. The synthesis of MUC1 glycopeptide models carrying a single or multiple Tn and/or sialyl&#8208;Tn antigen(s) is described. A novel approach for the sialyl&#8208;Tn threonine building block suitable for the solid phase peptide synthesis was developed. The thermodynamic profile of the binding interaction between the human MGL and MUC1 glycopeptide models was analyzed using isothermal titration calorimetry. The measured dissociation constants for the sialyl&#8208;Tn&#8208;bearing peptide epitopes were consistently lower compared to the Tn antigen and ranged from 10&#8197;&#956;M for mono&#8208; to 1&#8197;&#956;M for triglycosylated MUC1 peptide, respectively. All studied interactions, regardless of the glycan's site of attachment or density, exhibited enthalpy&#8208;driven thermodynamics.

         <title>Condensation domain editing of the FR900359 assembly line yields a novel analog amenable to late&#8208;stage functionalization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The natural product FR900359 (FR) has generated significant attention lately, due to its characteristics as potent and selective inhibitor of Gq/11 mediated signal transduction of associated G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs). This makes FR both a widely used pharmacological tool compound and a lead molecule for targeted cancer therapy. The exploration of structure&#8208;activity&#8208;relationship (SAR) of the scaffold by total synthesis has been complicated by its structural complexity and its incompatibility with standard approaches of solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. Options for late&#8208;stage functionalization of FR are limited due to a lack of tractable functional groups. Here we present a mixed approach combining i) genetic engineering of the FR&#8208;assembly line in Chromobacterium vaccinii, to obtain a novel FR analog featuring a primary amine, with ii) its subsequent synthetic modification and biological profiling for further SAR exploration of the FR scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>Heavy Metal Detection with Organic Moiety&#8208;Based Sensors: Recent Advances and Future Directions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Focusing on accuracy, selectivity, and sensitivity, this paper examines the necessity of sophisticated heavy metal detection methods. Using terpyridine, porphyrin, coumarin, and Schiff bases as organic moiety&#8208;based techniques, it also addresses recent advancements in fluorescence chemosensors for multi&#8208;ion detection, highlighting detection limitations, stoichiometry, Solvent systems, metal bindings, and applications.







Abstract
Heavy metal hazardous and enduring characteristics present a noteworthy risk to both human well&#8208;being and the ecosystem. Heavy metal level monitoring requires accurate and dependable detection techniques. This review emphasizes the requirement for sophisticated detection methods that can address the issues like sensitivity, selectivity, cost and ease of use for the detection of heavy metal ions and allow for more accurate and trustworthy monitoring using various organic moieties. It offers a thorough overview of cutting&#8208;edge organic moiety&#8208;based heavy metal detection techniques. It primarily discusses four different types of substituted core structures, including coumarin, porphyrin, Schiff bases, and terpyridine, along with their mechanisms, methods, detection limits, and appropriate metal bindings. These moieties exhibit strong coordination with heavy metal ions because of their distinct structural characteristics. They produce stable complexes with complicated ligand&#8208;metal interactions that are useful in a variety of applications, including sensing and catalysis. Each probe was chosen based on its propensity or capacity to identify important analytes in practical applications.

     alt="Heavy Metal Detection with Organic Moiety-Based Sensors: Recent Advances and Future Directions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on accuracy, selectivity, and sensitivity, this paper examines the necessity of sophisticated heavy metal detection methods. Using terpyridine, porphyrin, coumarin, and Schiff bases as organic moiety-based techniques, it also addresses recent advancements in fluorescence chemosensors for multi-ion detection, highlighting detection limitations, stoichiometry, Solvent systems, metal bindings, and applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavy metal hazardous and enduring characteristics present a noteworthy risk to both human well-being and the ecosystem. Heavy metal level monitoring requires accurate and dependable detection techniques. This review emphasizes the requirement for sophisticated detection methods that can address the issues like sensitivity, selectivity, cost and ease of use for the detection of heavy metal ions and allow for more accurate and trustworthy monitoring using various organic moieties. It offers a thorough overview of cutting-edge organic moiety-based heavy metal detection techniques. It primarily discusses four different types of substituted core structures, including coumarin, porphyrin, Schiff bases, and terpyridine, along with their mechanisms, methods, detection limits, and appropriate metal bindings. These moieties exhibit strong coordination with heavy metal ions because of their distinct structural characteristics. They produce stable complexes with complicated ligand-metal interactions that are useful in a variety of applications, including sensing and catalysis. Each probe was chosen based on its propensity or capacity to identify important analytes in practical applications. To increase the effectiveness and productivity of fluorescence sensing, researchers have recently been working to create new fluorescence chemosensors that can identify many ions at once.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ursolic Acid Conjugates: A New Frontier in Anticancer Drug Development</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New Ursolic Acid (UA) conjugates were synthesized using optimized synthetic protocols through the molecular hybridization approach at C&#8208;3 and C&#8208;28. This resulted in the targeted molecules being produced in good yields. Some of the synthesized conjugates showed significantly relevant bioactivity against mammalian cells and in animal models of cancers. Selected UA conjugates were tested against bladder and breast cancer cell lines. The conjugates showed moderate to significantly enhanced antiproliferative activities against Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC; MDA&#8208;MB 231), which is an aggressive tumor making up about 10&#8211;15% of all breast cancers and bladder (T24 and 5637) cancer cell lines. These properties were superior to the parent UA. Among all the synthesized compounds, 18c and 18d have exhibited promising antiproliferative and cytotoxic properties against all tested cancer cell lines. However, 18d has proved to be exceptionally selective for cancer cell lines, showing more cytotoxicity towards them than normal epithelial cells (MCF&#8208;12A). Compound 18d has demonstrated cytotoxicity against tumor cells, including those intrinsically resistant to chemotherapy drugs such as 2&#8208;difluoro&#8208;deoxy cytidine (Gemcitabine). The activity of the UA conjugates on tumor cells was mediated by multiple cytotoxic mechanisms, including drug&#8208;induced cytotoxic autophagy and programmed cell death, indicating a novel possibility of combination therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>A Single Enzyme in Enantiocomplementary Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Nitroalcohols: Bidirectional Catalysis by Hydroxynitrile Lyase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A single enzyme, Baliospermum montanum hydroxynitrile lyase (BmHNL), without alteration, enabled bidirectional catalysis in enantiocomplementary synthesis of chiral &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols. BmHNL catalyzed promiscuous Henry (24 examples) and retro&#8208;Henry reaction (22 examples) provided up to &gt;99% and 50% conversion to (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols respectively, while both cases displayed up to &gt;99% ee. The broad substrate scope and high stereoselectivity of BmHNL represents its synthetic applications in sustainable production of diverse chiral &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols. Kinetic parameters of BmHNL was determined for Henry and retro&#8208;Henry reaction, which reveals poor catalytic efficiency for both the promiscuous transformations, however, the former has better efficiency than the latter. Practical applicability of the biocatalyst and transformation was illustrated by preparative scale synthesis of chiral intermediates of (S)&#8208;Tembamide, and (S)&#8208;Micanozole.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;origami&#8208;armored DNA Condensates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA condensates, formed by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS), emerge as promising soft matter assemblies for creating artificial cells. The advantages of DNA condensates are their molecular permeability through the surface due to their membrane&#8208;less structure and their fluidic property. However, they face challenges in the design of their surface, e.g., unintended fusion and less regulation of permeable molecules. Addressing them, we report surface modification of DNA condensates with DNA origami nanoparticles, employing a Pickering&#8208;emulsion strategy. We successfully constructed core&#8208;shell structures with DNA origami coatings on DNA condensates and further enhanced the condensate stability toward fusion via connecting DNA origamis by responding to DNA input strands. The &#8216;armoring&#8217; prevented the fusion of DNA condensates, enabling the formation of multicellular&#8208;like structures of DNA condensates. Moreover, the permeability was altered through the state change from coating to armoring the DNA condensates. The armored DNA condensates have significant potential for constructing artificial cells, offering increased surface stability and selective permeability for small molecules while maintaining compartmentalized space and multicellular organization.</dc:description>

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble Multifunctional Probe for Colorimetric Copper Sensing, Lysosome Labelling and Live&#8208;Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a water&#8208;soluble fluorescence and colorimetric copper probe (LysoBC1); this system can also serve for lysosome labeling and for the dynamic tracking of Cu2+ in living cells. The sensing mechanism takes advantage of the synergic action by the following three components: i) a lysosome targeting unit, ii) the spirolactam ring&#8208;opening for the selective copper chelation and iii) the metal&#8208;mediated hydrolysis of the rhodamine moiety for fluorescence enhancement. In aqueous environment the molecule acts as a fluorescent reversible pH sensor and as colorimetric probe for Cu2+ at physiological pH; the hydrolysis of the copper targeting unit resulted in a 50&#8208;fold increase of the fluorescence intensity. Most importantly, in vitro cell analyses in undifferentiated (SH SY5Y) and differentiated (d&#8208;SH SY5Y) neuroblastoma cells, LysoBC1 is able to selectively accumulate into lysosome while the copper binding ability allowed us to monitor intracellular copper accumulation into lysosome.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of uniform ribosome display technology enabling easy and efficient identification of full&#8208;length proteins that interact with bioactive small and large molecules</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Identifying target proteins that interact with bioactive molecules is indispensable for understanding their mechanisms of action. In this study, we developed a uniform ribosome display technology using equal&#8208;length DNAs and mRNAs to improve molecular display principle for target identification. The equal&#8208;length DNAs were designed to contain various coding sequences for full&#8208;length proteins with molecular weights of up to 130 kDa and were used to synthesize equal&#8208;length mRNAs, which allowed the formation of full&#8208;length protein&#8208;ribosome&#8208;equal&#8208;length mRNA complexes. Uniform ribosome display selections of dihydrofolate reductase and haloalkane dehalogenase mutant were performed against methotrexate and chlorohexane, respectively. Quantitative changes of proteins after each selection indicated that the target protein&#8208;displaying ribosomal complexes were specifically selected through non&#8208;covalent or covalent interactions with the corresponding bioactive molecules. Furthermore, selection of full&#8208;length proteins interacting with methotrexate or anti&#8208;DDX46 antibody from protein pools showed that only the target proteins could be precisely identified even though the molar amounts of equal&#8208;length mRNAs encoding them were adjusted to 1/20,000 of the total equal&#8208;length mRNAs. Thus, the uniform ribosome display technology enabled efficient identification of target proteins that interact with bioactive small and large molecules through simplified operations without deep sequencing.</dc:description>

         <title>Senolytic Prodrugs: A Promising Approach to Enhancing Senescence&#8208;targeting Intervention</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cellular senescence has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for aging and a wide range of age&#8208;related disorders. Despite the encouraging therapeutic impact of senolytic agents on improving lifespan and the outcomes of pharmacological intervention, the senolytic induced side effects pose barriers to clinical application. There is a pressing need for selective ablation of senescent cells (SnCs). The design of senolytic prodrugs has been demonstrated as a promising approach to addressing these issues. These prodrugs are generally designed via modification of senolytics with a cleavable galactose moiety to respond to the senescent biomarker &#8208; senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal) to restore their therapeutic effects. In this Concept, we summarize the developments by categorizing these prodrugs into two classes: 1) galactose&#8208;modified senolytic prodrugs, in which sensing unit galactose is either directly conjugated to the drug or via a self&#8208;immolative linker and 2) bioorthogonal activation of senolytic prodrugs. In the bioorthogonal prodrug design, galactose is incorporated into dihydrotetrazine to sense SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal for click activation. Notably, in addition to repurposed chemotherapeutics and small molecule inhibitors, PROTACs and photodynamic therapy have been introduced as new senolytics in the prodrug design. It is expected that the senolytic prodrugs would facilitate translating small&#8208;molecule senolytics into clinical use.</dc:description>

         <title>From the Design of Innovative Ti&#8208;Pt Heterometallic Complexes to the Development of Highly Anti&#8208;Proliferative Water&#8208;Soluble Cationic Titanocenes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented Ti&#8208;Pt heterobimetallic complexes are synthesized, and are tested in various cancer cell lines exhibiting superior anti&#8208;proliferative properties compared to their monometallic counterparts. Notably, one of the corresponding non&#8208;platinum titanocene&#8208;terpyridine water&#8208;soluble derivative demonstrates high stability in PBS, submicromolar anti&#8208;proliferative activity in vitro, significant anticancer effects in vivo, and is trackable via multiphoton microscopy imaging.







Abstract
Two innovative early/late Ti&#8722;Pt&#8208;heterobimetallic complexes were synthesized, characterized, and screened in cell&#8208;based assays using several human (SW480 and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231) and murine cancer cell lines (CT26 and EMT6) as well as a non&#8208;cancerous cell line (HMEC). The combination of the two metals &#8211; titanium(IV) and platinum (IV) &#8211; in a single molecule led to a synergistic biological activity (higher anti&#8208;proliferative properties than a mixture of each of the corresponding monometallic complexes). This study also investigated the benefits of associating a metal&#8208;free terpyridine moiety (with intrinsic biological activity) with a water&#8208;soluble titanocene fragment. The present work reveals that these combinations results in water&#8208;soluble titanocene compounds displaying an anti&#8208;proliferative activity down to the submicromolar level. One of these complexes induced an antitumor effect in&#8197;vivo in CT26 tumor bearing BALB/C mice. The terpyridine moiety was also used to track the complex in&#8197;vitro by multiphoton microscopy imaging.

         <title>Advances in Polymeric Nanomaterial&#8208;mediated Autophagy for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review paper explores the utilization of polymeric nanomaterials for modulating autophagy in cancer treatment. By either promoting or suppressing the autophagy pathway, these polymeric nanomaterials can effectively influence the fate of cancer cells. This paper systematically introduces different kinds of polymeric nanomaterials and describes their design principles and applications in cancer therapy.







Abstract
Autophagy is an important biological mechanism for eukaryotic cells to regulate growth, death, and energy metabolism, and plays an important role in removing damaged organelles, misfolded or aggregated proteins, and clearing pathogens. It has been found that autophagy is closely related to cell survival and death, and is of great significance in cancerigenesis and development, playing a bidirectional role in cancer inhibition and cancer promotion. Therefore, treating cancers by regulating autophagy has attracted much attention. A large amount of research evidence indicates that polymeric nanomaterials are able to regulate cellular autophagy, and their good biocompatibility, degradability, and functionalizable modification open up a broad application prospect for improving the therapeutic effect of cancers. This review provides an overview of the research progress of polymeric nanomaterials for modulating autophagy in the treatment of cancers.

         <title>Fluorocarbon&#8208;DNA Conjugates for Enhanced Cellular Delivery: Formation of a Densely Packed DNA Nano&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA conjugates were synthesized possessing perfluoroalkyl (RF) groups with different length, position, number, and stereochemistry. Systematical structural investigation revealed that the incorporation of a few long RF groups at the terminus of a DNA strand contributed to the formation of a nano&#8208;assembly with exceedingly high DNA density, which allowed itself taken up into cells efficiently.







Abstract
Forming nano&#8208;assemblies is essential for delivering DNA conjugates into cells, with the DNA density in the nano&#8208;assembly playing an important role in determining the uptake efficiency. In this study, we developed a strategy for the facile synthesis of DNA strands bearing perfluoroalkyl (RF) groups (RF&#8208;DNA conjugates) and investigated how they affect cellular uptake. An RF&#8208;DNA conjugate bearing a long RF group at the DNA terminus forms a nano&#8208;assembly with a high DNA density, which results in greatly enhanced cellular uptake. The uptake mechanism is mediated by clathrin&#8208;dependent endocytosis. The use of RF groups to densely assemble negatively charged DNA is a useful strategy for designing drug delivery carriers.

         <title>How Clavulanic Acid Inhibits Serine &#946;&#8208;Lactamases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clavulanic acid is a medicinally important inhibitor of serine &#946;&#8208;lactamases (SBLs). We report studies on the mechanisms by which clavulanic acid inhibits representative Ambler class A (TEM&#8208;116), C (Escherichia coli AmpC), and D (OXA&#8208;10) SBLs using denaturing and non&#8208;denaturing mass spectrometry (MS). Similarly to observations with penam sulfones, most of the results support a mechanism involving acyl enzyme complex formation, followed by oxazolidine ring opening without efficient subsequent scaffold fragmentation (at pH 7.5). This observation contrasts with previous MS studies, which identified clavulanic acid scaffold fragmented species as the predominant SBL bound products. In all the SBLs studied here, fragmentation was promoted by acidic conditions, which are commonly used in LC&#8209;MS analyses. Slow fragmentation was, however, observed under neutral conditions with TEM&#8208;116 on prolonged reaction with clavulanic acid. Although our results imply clavulanic acid scaffold fragmentation is likely not crucial for SBL inhibition in vivo, development of inhibitors that fragment to give stable covalent complexes is of interest.</dc:description>

         <title>Profiling Cellular Morphological Changes Induced by Dual&#8208;Targeting PROTACs of Aurora Kinase and RNA&#8208;Binding Protein YTHDF2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evaluation of the multi&#8208;kinase PROTACs revealed the first examples of PROTAC degraders for the RNA&#8208;binding protein YTHDF2. Morphological profiling of the PROTACs via the cell painting assay complemented the current characterization toolbox for PROTACs and provided insights into biological targets and mechanisms of action at the cellular phenotypic level.







Abstract
Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are new chemical modalities that degrade proteins of interest, including established kinase targets and emerging RNA&#8208;binding proteins (RBPs). Whereas diverse sets of biochemical, biophysical and cellular assays are available for the evaluation and optimizations of PROTACs in understanding the involved ubiquitin&#8722;proteasome&#8208;mediated degradation mechanism and the structure&#8208;degradation relationship, a phenotypic method profiling the cellular morphological changes is rarely used. In this study, first, we reported the only examples of PROTACs degrading the mRNA&#8208;binding protein YTHDF2 via screening of multikinase PROTACs. Second, we reported the profiling of cellular morphological changes of the dual kinase&#8208; and RBP&#8208;targeting PROTACs using the unbiased cell painting assay (CPA). The CPA analysis revealed the high biosimilarity with the established aurora kinase cluster and annotated aurora kinase inhibitors, which reflected the association between YTHDF2 and the aurora kinase signaling network. Broadly, the results demonstrated that the cell painting assay can be a straightforward and powerful approach to evaluate PROTACs. Complementary to the existing biochemical, biophysical and cellular assays, CPA provided a new perspective in characterizing PROTACs at the cellular morphology.

&lt;p&gt;Evaluation of the multi-kinase PROTACs revealed the first examples of PROTAC degraders for the RNA-binding protein YTHDF2. Morphological profiling of the PROTACs via the cell painting assay complemented the current characterization toolbox for PROTACs and provided insights into biological targets and mechanisms of action at the cellular phenotypic level.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are new chemical modalities that degrade proteins of interest, including established kinase targets and emerging RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Whereas diverse sets of biochemical, biophysical and cellular assays are available for the evaluation and optimizations of PROTACs in understanding the involved ubiquitin&#8722;proteasome-mediated degradation mechanism and the structure-degradation relationship, a phenotypic method profiling the cellular morphological changes is rarely used. In this study, first, we reported the only examples of PROTACs degrading the mRNA-binding protein YTHDF2 via screening of multikinase PROTACs. Second, we reported the profiling of cellular morphological changes of the dual kinase- and RBP-targeting PROTACs using the unbiased cell painting assay (CPA). The CPA analysis revealed the high biosimilarity with the established aurora kinase cluster and annotated aurora kinase inhibitors, which reflected the association between YTHDF2 and the aurora kinase signaling network. Broadly, the results demonstrated that the cell painting assay can be a straightforward and powerful approach to evaluate PROTACs. Complementary to the existing biochemical, biophysical and cellular assays, CPA provided a new perspective in characterizing PROTACs at the cellular morphology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sunflower Pollen&#8208;Derived Microspheres Selectively Absorb DNA for microRNA Detection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a sunflower pollen&#8208;derived microsphere (HSEC) with hierarchical structures is developed to selectively absorb polyC and polyA single&#8208;stranded DNA with high efficiency and affinity, particularly in the presence of Ca2+ and under neutral and acidic conditions. The absorption mechanism involves electrostatic and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, highlighting the potential of HSECs for diverse biomedical applications, such as microRNA detection.







Abstract
Herein, we report the finding that a naturally sunflower pollen&#8208;derived microspheres (HSECs) with hierarchical structures can selectively absorb polyC and polyA with high efficiency and affinity. HSECs exhibit the capability to selectively absorb polyC and polyA ssDNA under neutral and acidic conditions. It has been observed that the presence of metal cations, specifically Ca2+, enhances the absorption efficiency of HSECs. Mechanically, this absorption phenomenon can be attributed to both electrostatic interactions and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions. Such an appealing property enables the functionalization of HSECs for broad potential biomedical applications, such as microRNA detection.

         <title>Development of Putative Bivalent Dicovalent Ligands for the Adenosine A1 Receptor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bivalent dicovalent compounds for the adenosine A1 receptor. We developed a series of bivalent compounds whereby each side contains the same ligand and covalent warhead. We show these compounds could be interacting across the adenosine A1 homodimer and have improved adenosine receptor subtype selectivity compared to the single covalent ligand counterpart.







Abstract
Accumulating evidence suggests that G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) can exist and function in homodimer and heterodimer forms. The adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) has been shown to form both homodimers and heterodimers, but there is a lack of chemical tools to study these dimeric receptor populations. This work describes the synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of a novel class of bivalent GPCR chemical tools, where each ligand moiety of the bivalent compound contains a sulfonyl fluoride covalent warhead designed to be capable of simultaneously reacting with each A1R of an A1R homodimer. The novel compounds were characterised using radioligand binding assays, including washout assays, and functionally in cAMP assays. The bivalent dicovalent compounds were competitive A1R antagonists and showed evidence of covalent binding and simultaneous binding across an A1R homodimer. Greater selectivity for A1R over the adenosine A3 receptor was observed for bivalent dicovalent over the equivalent monovalent compounds, indicating subtype selectivity can be achieved with dual occupation by a bivalent dicovalent ligand.

         <title>An Active and Versatile Electron Transport System for Cytochrome P450 Monooxygenases from the Alkane Degrading Organism Acinetobacter sp. OC4</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferredoxin reductase (FdR) and ferredoxin (FD) from Acinetobacter sp. OC4 demonstrate to form a suitable electron transport system for CYP153A&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Spectral analysis confirms NADH reduction capability, while linker fusion strategies enhance electron transfer to model electron acceptors. The systems&#8216; application in driving various CYP153A subfamily members underscores their potential as a versatile electron transport system.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) are valuable biocatalysts for the oxyfunctionalization of non&#8208;activated carbon&#8208;hydrogen bonds. Most CYPs rely on electron transport proteins as redox partners. In this study, the ferredoxin reductase (FdR) and ferredoxin (FD) for a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase from Acinetobacter sp. OC4 are investigated. Upon heterologous production of both proteins independently in Escherichia coli, spectral analysis showed their reduction capability towards reporter electron acceptors, e.&#8201;g., cytochrome c. The individual proteins&#8217; specific activity towards cytochrome c reduction was 25&#8197;U&#8201;mg&#8722;1. Furthermore, the possibility to enhance electron transfer by artificial fusion of the units was elucidated. FdR and FD were linked by helical linkers [EAAAK]n, flexible glycine linkers [GGGGS]n or rigid proline linkers [EPPPP]n of n=1&#8211;4 sequence repetitions. The system with a glycine linker (n=4) reached an appreciable specific activity of 19&#8197;U&#8201;mg&#8722;1 towards cytochrome c. Moreover, their ability to drive different members of the CYP153A subfamily is demonstrated. By creating artificial self&#8208;sufficient P450s with FdR, FD, and a panel of four CYP153A representatives, effective hydroxylation of n&#8208;hexane in a whole&#8208;cell system was achieved. The results indicate this protein combination to constitute a functional and versatile surrogate electron transport system for this subfamily.

         <title>Structures and Protein Engineering of the &#945;&#8208;Keto Acid C&#8208;Methyltransferases SgvM and MrsA for Rational Substrate Transfer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The S&#8208;Adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine&#8208;dependent C&#8208;methyltransferases SgvM and MrsA catalyze the stereoselective methylation of enolizable &#945;&#8208;keto acids in the biosynthesis of antibiotic natural products. By investigating key residues of the crystallized enzymes and rational engineering of MrsA, the substrate scope can be transferred to &#945;&#8208;keto acid substrates from different biosynthetic pathways, enabling enzymatic C&#8208;methylation beyond native substrates.







Abstract
S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine&#8208;dependent methyltransferases (MTs) are involved in the C&#8208;methylation of a variety of natural products. The MTs SgvM from Streptomyces griseoviridis and MrsA from Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae catalyze the methylation of the &#946;&#8208;carbon atom of &#945;&#8208;keto acids in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic natural products viridogrisein and 3&#8208;methylarginine, respectively. MrsA shows high substrate selectivity for 5&#8208;guanidino&#8208;2&#8208;oxovalerate, while other &#945;&#8208;keto acids, such as the SgvM substrates 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxovalerate, 2&#8208;oxovalerate, and phenylpyruvate, are not accepted. Here we report the crystal structures of SgvM and MrsA in the apo form and bound with substrate or S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine. By investigating key residues for substrate recognition in the active sites of both enzymes and engineering MrsA by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, the substrate range of MrsA was extended to accept &#945;&#8208;keto acid substrates of SgvM with uncharged and lipophilic &#946;&#8208;residues. Our results showcase the transfer of the substrate scope of &#945;&#8208;keto acid MTs from different biosynthetic pathways by rational design.

By investigating key residues for substrate recognition in the active sites of both enzymes and engineering MrsA by site-directed mutagenesis, the substrate range of MrsA was extended to accept &#945;-keto acid substrates of SgvM with uncharged and lipophilic &#946;-residues. Our results showcase the transfer of the substrate scope of &#945;-keto acid MTs from different biosynthetic pathways by rational design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>CNS Drug Discovery in Academia: Where Basic Research Meets Innovation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drug discovery in academia provides both challenges and opportunities as shown by an in&#8208;depth analysis of drug discovery projects in the Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research TransCure (2010&#8211;2022). A successful translational project related to selective endocannabinoid reuptake inhibitors is discussed providing a showcase of how innovative research in academia can inspire drug discovery.







Abstract
The involvement of academic research in drug discovery is consistently growing. However, academic projects seldom advance to clinical trials. Here, we assess the landscape of drug discovery within the National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) TransCure launched by the Swiss National Science Foundation to foster basic research and early&#8208;stage drug discovery on membrane transporters. This included transporters in central nervous system (CNS) disorders, which represent a huge unmet medical need. While idea championship, sustainable funding, collaborations between disciplines at the interface of academia and industry are important for translational research, Popperian falsifiability, strong intellectual property and a motivated startup team are key elements for innovation. This is exemplified by the NCCR TransCure spin&#8208;off company Synendos Therapeutics, a clinical stage biotech company developing the first selective endocannabinoid reuptake inhibitors (SERIs) as novel treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders. We provide a perspective on the challenges related to entering an uncharted druggable space and bridging the often mentioned &#8220;valley of death&#8221;. The high attrition rate of drug discovery projects in the CNS field within academia is often due to the lack of meaningful animal models that can provide pharmacological proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for potentially disruptive technologies at the earliest stages, and the absence of solid intellectual property.

         <title>Oligonucleotide&#8208;Based Photoaffinity Probes: Chemical Tools and Applications for Protein Labeling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoactivatable oligonucleotides in combination with recent developments in mass spectrometry are powerful tools for studying nucleic acid&#8208;protein interactions involved in numerous biological processes. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the different strategies for incorporating the most used photoreactive reagents into oligonucleotides probes and we illustrate their applications with several examples.







Abstract
A variety of proteins interact with DNA and RNA, including polymerases, histones, ribosomes, transcription factors, and repair enzymes. However, the transient non&#8208;covalent nature of these interactions poses challenges for analysis. Introducing a covalent bond between proteins and DNA via photochemical activation of a photosensitive functional group introduced onto nucleic acids offers a means to stabilize these often weak interactions without significantly altering the binding interface. Consequently, photoactivatable oligonucleotides are powerful tools for investigating nucleic acid&#8208;protein interactions involved in numerous biological and pathological processes. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the chemical tools developed so far and the different strategies used for incorporating the most commonly used photoreactive reagents into oligonucleotide probes or nucleic acids. Furthermore, we illustrate their application with several examples including protein binding site mapping, identification of protein binding partners, and in cell studies.

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;Induced Suppression of PEG Crystallization from the Melt in a PEG&#8208;Peptide Conjugate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;CD) on crystallization of PEG in an amyloid peptide&#8208;PEG conjugate is investigated by SAXS/WAXS and DSC. The crystallization of PEG is suppressed (with sufficiently high &#945;CD content in the blends) due to complexation with &#945;CD, leading to hexagonal mesophase formation.







Abstract
The influence of alpha&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;CD) on PEG crystallization is examined for a peptide&#8208;PEG conjugate, YYKLVFF&#8208;PEG3k comprising an amyloid peptide YYKLVFF linked to PEG with molar mass 3&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Remarkably, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and simultaneous synchrotron small&#8208;angle/wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) show that crystallization of PEG is suppressed by &#945;CD, provided that the cyclodextrin content is sufficient. A hexagonal mesophase is formed instead. The &#945;CD threading reduces the conformational flexibility of PEG, and hence suppresses crystallization. These results show that addition of cyclodextrins can be used to tune the crystallization of peptide&#8208;polymer conjugates and potentially other polymer/biomolecular hybrids.

         <title>Biocatalysis with In&#8208;Situ Product Removal Improves p&#8208;Coumaric Acid Production</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tyrosine ammonia lyase suffers from product inhibition, a common issue in biocatalytic processes. An aqueous two&#8208;phase system was developed for the extraction of the product p&#8208;coumaric acid at high pH. Immobilization of tyrosine ammonia lyase allowed for in&#8208;situ product removal in the aqueous two&#8208;phase system, improving the biocatalysis production metrics.







Abstract
Natural and pure p&#8208;coumaric acid has valuable applications, and it can be produced via bioprocessing. However, fermentation processes have so far been unable to provide sufficient production metrics, while a biocatalytic process decoupling growth and production historically showed much promise. This biocatalytic process is revisited in order to tackle product inhibition of the key enzyme tyrosine ammonia lyase. In situ product removal is proposed as a possible solution, and a polymer/salt aqueous two&#8208;phase system is identified as a suitable system for extraction of p&#8208;coumaric acid from an alkaline solution, with a partition coefficient of up to 13. However, a 10&#8201;% salt solution was found to reduce tyrosine ammonia lyase activity by 19&#8201;%, leading to the need for a more dilute system. The cloud points of two aqueous two&#8208;phase systems at 40&#8201;&#176;C and pH&#8197;10 were found to be 3.8&#8201;% salt and 9.5&#8201;% polymer, and a 5&#8201;% potassium phosphate and 12.5&#8201;% poly(ethylene glycol&#8208;ran&#8208;propylene glycol) mW~2500 system was selected for in&#8197;situ product removal. An immobilized tyrosine ammonia lyase biocatalyst in this aqueous two&#8208;phase system produced up to 33&#8197;g/L p&#8208;coumaric acid within 24&#8197;hours, a 1.9&#8208;fold improvement compared to biocatalysis without in&#8197;situ product removal.
