         <title>Chemical labelling of protein 4'&#8208;phosphopantetheinylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature utilizes a diverse array of protein post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) to regulate protein structure, activity, localization, and function. Among them, protein 4'&#8208;phosphopantetheinylation derived from Coenzyme A (CoA) is an essential PTM for the biosynthesis of fatty acids, polyketides, and non&#8208;ribosomal peptides in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. To explore its functions, various chemical probes mimicking the natural structure of 4'&#8208;phosphopantetheinylation have been developed. In this minireview, we summarize these chemical probes and describe their applications in direct and metabolic labelling of proteins in bacterial and mammalian cells.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT) involves in many cellular processes and selective OGT inhibitors are valuable tools to investigate O&#8208;GlcNAcylation functions, and could potentially lead to therapeutics. However, high&#8208;throughput OGT assays that are suitable for large&#8208;scale HTS, and can identify inhibitors targeting both acceptor, donor sites, and allosteric binding&#8208;sites are still lacking. Here, we report the development of a high&#8208;throughput &#8220;FP&#8208;Tag&#8221; OGT assay with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a low&#8208;cost and superior &#8220;FP&#8208;Tag&#8221;. With this assay, 2&#8208;methyleurotinone was identified as a low &#956;M&#8208;range OGT inhibitor. This type of assay with BSA as &#8220;FP&#8208;Tag&#8221; would find more applications with other glycosyltransferases.</dc:description>

         <title>The Ubiquitin Enigma: Progress in the Detection and Chemical Synthesis of Branched Ubiquitin Chains</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 21, Issue 23, Page 3313-3318, December 1, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Much effort has been made in the structural and biochemical characterization of branched ubiquitin chains. This concept considers recent progress in analyzing their biological function, towards their detection by using proteomic studies, and in the chemical synthesis of branched Ub chains and their derivates.







Abstract
Ubiquitin chains with distinct topologies play essential roles in eukaryotic cells. Recently, it was discovered that multiple ubiquitin units can be ligated to more than one lysine residue in the same ubiquitin to form diverse branched ubiquitin chains. Although there is increasing evidence implicating these branched chains in a plethora of biological functions, few mechanistic details have been elucidated. This concept article introduces the function, detection and chemical synthesis of branched ubiquitin chains; and offers some future perspective for this exciting new field.

         <title>Distinct Mechanisms for Processing Autophagy Protein LC3&#8208;PE by RavZ and ATG4B</title>

Cut autophagy: Semisynthetic lipidated autophagy protein LC3&#8208;PE enables biochemical and structural analysis of the protein's structure&#8208;function relationship. The distinct binding modes of the LC3 C&#8208;terminal motif might determine the specificity of cleavage by endogenous ATG4 and the Legionella effector RavZ.







Abstract
Autophagy is a conserved catabolic process involved in the elimination of proteins, organelles and pathogens in eukaryotic cells. Lipidated LC3 proteins that are conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) play a key role in autophagosome biogenesis. Endogenous ATG4&#8208;mediated deconjugation of LC3&#8208;PE is required for LC3 recycling. However, the Legionella effector RavZ irreversibly deconjugates LC3&#8208;PE to inhibit autophagy. It is not clear how ATG4 and RavZ process LC3&#8208;PE with distinct modes. Herein, a series of semisynthetic LC3&#8208;PE proteins containing C&#8208;terminal mutations or insertions were used to investigate the relationship of the C&#8208;terminal structure of LC3&#8208;PE with ATG4/RavZ&#8208;mediated deconjugation. Using a combination of molecular docking and biochemical assays, we found that Gln116, Phe119 and Gly120 of LC3&#8208;PE are required for cleavage by both RavZ and ATG4B, whereas Glu117(LC3) is specific to cleavage by RavZ. The molecular ruler mechanism exists in the active site of ATG4B, but not in RavZ. Met63 and Gln64 at the active site of RavZ are involved in accommodating LC3 C&#8208;terminal motif. Our findings show that the distinct binding modes of the LC3 C&#8208;terminal motif (116&#8211;120) with ATG4 and RavZ might determine the specificity of cleavage site.

         <title>A Bimane&#8208;Based Peptide Staple for Combined Helical Induction and Fluorescent Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 21, Issue 23, Page 3423-3432, December 1, 2020. </description>

Two in one: A repurposed fluorescent thiol labelling agent, dibromobimane, is used to form a peptide constraint to introduce helical structure into short peptides. The cyclisation can be conducted on&#8208;resin following SPPS or in solution. The resultant inherently fluorescent peptides are compatible with cell&#8208;uptake imaging experiments and mitigate the need to introduce a secondary tag.







Abstract
The thiol&#8208;selective fluorescent imaging agent, dibromobimane, has been repurposed to crosslink cysteine&#8208; and homocysteine&#8208;containing peptides, with the resulting bimane linker acting as both a structural constraint and a fluorescent tag. Macrocyclisation was conducted on nine short peptides containing two cysteines and/or homocysteines, both on&#8208;resin and in buffered aqueous solution, to give macrocycles ranging in size from 16 (i,i+2) to 31 (i,i+7) atoms. The structures were defined by CD, NMR structure calculations by using Xplor&#8208;NIH, NMR secondary shift and JH&#945;NH analyses to reveal helical structure in the i,i+4 (1, 2), and i,i+3 (5) constrained peptides. Cellular&#8208;uptake studies were conducted with three of the macrocycles. Subsequent confocal imaging revealed punctate fluorescence within the cytosol indicative of peptides trapped in endocytic vesicles. These studies demonstrate that dibromobimane is an effective tool for defining secondary structure within short peptides, whilst simultaneously introducing a fluorescent tag suitable for common cell&#8208;based experiments.

PNAs form higher&#8208;stability triple helices with dsRNA than DNA. Structural considerations suggested that extending the PNA backbone by one carbon atom might reverse this preference in favor of DNA; however, experiments disproved this hypothesis. The studies suggested that PNA has an inherent preference for forming A&#8208;form triple&#8208;helical structures and, hence, has higher affinity for RNA than DNA.







Abstract
Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) forms a triple helix with double&#8208;stranded RNA (dsRNA) stabilized by a hydrogen&#8208;bonding zipper formed by PNA's backbone amides (N&#8722;H) interacting with RNA phosphate oxygens. This hydrogen&#8208;bonding pattern is enabled by the matching &#8764;5.7&#8197;&#197; spacing (typical for A&#8208;form dsRNA) between PNA's backbone amides and RNA phosphate oxygens. We hypothesized that extending the PNA's backbone by one &#8722;CH2&#8722; group might bring the distance between PNA amide groups closer to 7&#8197;&#197;, which is favourable for hydrogen bonding to the B&#8208;form dsDNA phosphate oxygens. Extension of the PNA backbone was expected to selectively stabilize PNA&#8208;DNA triplexes compared to PNA&#8208;RNA. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized triplex&#8208;forming PNAs that had the pseudopeptide backbones extended by an additional &#8722;CH2&#8722; group in three different positions. Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements of the binding affinity of these extended PNA analogues for the matched dsDNA and dsRNA showed that, contrary to our structural reasoning, extending the PNA backbone at any position had a strong negative effect on triplex stability. Our results suggest that PNAs might have an inherent preference for A&#8208;form&#8208;like conformations when binding double&#8208;stranded nucleic acids. It appears that the original six&#8208;atom&#8208;long PNA backbone is an almost perfect fit for binding to A&#8208;form nucleic acids.

For solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion, a new inorganic&#8208;biological hybrid system has been developed by combining the bacterial precipitation of cadmium sulfide and the heterologous expression of hydrogenase gene in a single E. coli cell. This system integrated features of both stable semiconductors and selective enzymes, and achieved hydrogen production under visible light irradiation.







Abstract
An inorganic&#8208;biological hybrid system that integrates features of both stable and efficient semiconductors and selective and efficient enzymes is attractive for facilitating the conversion of solar energy to hydrogen. In this study, we aimed to develop a new photocatalytic hydrogen&#8208;production system based on Escherichia coli whole&#8208;cell genetically engineered as a biocatalysis for highly active hydrogen formation. The photocatalysis part was obtained by bacterial precipitation of cadmium sulfide (CdS), which is a visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive semiconductor. The recombinant E. coli cells were sequentially subjected to CdS precipitation and heterologous [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase synthesis to yield a CdS@E. coli hybrid capable of light energy conversion and hydrogen formation in a single cell. The CdS@E. coli hybrid achieved photocatalytic hydrogen production with a sacrificial electron donor, thus demonstrating the feasibility of our system and expanding the current knowledge of photosensitization using a whole&#8208;cell biocatalyst with a bacterially precipitated semiconductor.

         <title>Bioimaging and Biodistribution of the Metal&#8208;Ion&#8208;Controlled Self&#8208;Assembly of PYY3&#8211;36 Studied by SPECT/CT</title>

Peptide self&#8208;assembly: Radiolabeling of a re&#8208;engineered peptide YY3&#8211;36 (PYY3&#8211;36) with a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine ligand enabled higher&#8208;order self&#8208;assemblies through coordination with CuII. We studied the effect of the self&#8208;assembly in&#8197;vivo by using non&#8208;invasive quantitative bioimaging. Abiotic ligands might influence the controlled release of biopharmaceuticals from subcutaneous depots.







Abstract
The controlled self&#8208;assembly of peptide&#8208; and protein&#8208;based pharmaceuticals is of central importance for their mode of action and tuning of their properties. Peptide YY3&#8211;36 (PYY3&#8211;36) is a 36&#8208;residue peptide hormone that reduces food intake when peripherally administered. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a PYY3&#8211;36 analogue functionalized with a metal&#8208;ion&#8208;binding 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine ligand that enables self&#8208;assembly through metal complexation. Upon addition of CuII, the bipyridine&#8208;modified PYY3&#8211;36 peptide binds stoichiometric quantities of metal ions in solution and contributes to the organization of higher&#8208;order assemblies. In this study, we aimed to explore the size effect of the self&#8208;assembly in&#8197;vivo by using non&#8208;invasive quantitative single&#8208;photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging. For this purpose, bipyridine&#8208;modified PYY3&#8211;36 was radiolabeled with a chelator holding 111InIII, followed by the addition of CuII to the bipyridine ligand. SPECT/CT imaging and biodistribution studies showed fast renal clearance and accumulation in the kidney cortex. The radiolabeled bipyridyl&#8208;PYY3&#8211;36 conjugates with and without CuII presented a slightly slower excretion 1&#8197;h post injection compared to the unmodified&#8208;PYY3&#8211;36, thus demonstrating that higher self&#8208;assemblies of the peptide might have an effect on the pharmacokinetics.

Breaking into fragments: A biophysical platform for determining the complex structure&#8211;activity relationships of covalent fragments. By using this approach, a novel series of covalent fragments has been identified for targeting electrophile&#8208;sensitive kinases; optimization is facilitated by covalent fragment merging.







Abstract
Chemical probes that covalently modify cysteine residues in a protein&#8208;specific manner are valuable tools for biological investigations. Covalent fragments are increasingly implemented as probe starting points, but the complex relationship between fragment structure and binding kinetics makes covalent fragment optimization uniquely challenging. We describe a new technique in covalent probe discovery that enables data&#8208;driven optimization of covalent fragment potency and selectivity. This platform extends beyond the existing repertoire of methods for identifying covalent fragment hits by facilitating rapid multiparameter kinetic analysis of covalent structure&#8211;activity relationships through the simultaneous determination of Ki, kinact and intrinsic reactivity. By applying this approach to develop novel probes against electrophile&#8208;sensitive kinases, we showcase the utility of the platform in hit identification and highlight how multiparameter kinetic analysis enabled a successful fragment&#8208;merging strategy.

Get the most out of your ligation: Nonenzymatic DNA ligation with carbodiimides often results in low ligation yields. Using a simple bimolecular ligating framework, we systematically identified parameters that can be optimized to achieve near&#8208;quantitative ligation.







Abstract
Chemical ligation is an important tool for the generation of synthetic DNA structures, which are used for a wide range of applications. Surprisingly, reported chemical ligation yields can range from 30 to 95&#8201;% for the same chemical activating agent and comparable DNA structures. We report a systematic study of DNA ligation by using a well&#8208;defined bimolecular test system and a water&#8208;soluble carbodiimide (EDC) as a phosphate&#8208;activating agent. Our results emphasize the interplay between template&#8208;substrate complex stability and the rates of the chemical steps of ligation, with 3&#8242; phosphate substrates providing yields near 100&#8201;% after 24&#8197;hours for particularly favorable reaction conditions. Ligation rates are also shown to be sensitive to the identity of the base pairs flanking a nick site, with as much as threefold variation. Finally, the observation that DNA substrates are modified by EDC at rates that can be comparable with ligation rates emphasizes the importance of considering side reactions when designing protocols to maximize ligation yields.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get the most out of your ligation&lt;/b&gt;: Nonenzymatic DNA ligation with carbodiimides often results in low ligation yields. Using a simple bimolecular ligating framework, we systematically identified parameters that can be optimized to achieve near&#8208;quantitative ligation.

&lt;/p&gt;

It's degrading: We report the structure&#8208;based development of a chloroalkylated sirtuin rearranging ligand (SirReal) that induces Sirt2 degradation mediated by Halo&#8208;tagged E3 ubiquitin ligases. Using this approach, we show that besides cereblon, other E3 ligases such as parkin, can be harnessed for small&#8208;molecule&#8208;induced Sirt2 degradation.







Abstract
We have discovered the sirtuin&#8208;rearranging ligands (SirReals) as a novel class of highly potent and selective inhibitors of the NAD+&#8208;dependent lysine deacetylase sirtuin 2 (Sirt2). In previous studies, conjugation of a SirReal with a ligand for the E3 ubiquitin ligase cereblon to form a so&#8208;called proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC) enabled small&#8208;molecule&#8208;induced degradation of Sirt2. Herein, we report the structure&#8208;based development of a chloroalkylated SirReal that induces the degradation of Sirt2 mediated by Halo&#8208;tagged E3 ubiquitin ligases. Using this orthogonal approach for Sirt2 degradation, we show that other E3 ligases than cereblon, such as the E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin, can also be harnessed for small&#8208;molecule&#8208;induced Sirt2 degradation, thereby emphasizing the great potential of parkin to be used as an E3 ligase for new PROTACs approaches. Thus, our study provides new insights into targeted protein degradation in general and Sirt2 degradation in particular.

         <title>Methyltransferase Contingencies in the Pathway of Everninomicin D Antibiotics and Analogues</title>

M. carbonacea species produce the everninomicin antibiotics, elaborate oligosaccharides with potent antibacterial activity. Herein, we demonstrate a genetic system for genome editing of everninomicin producers, including a new microporous intergeneric conjugation system for conjugal transfer, and analyze a host of methyltransferases spanning the octasaccharide scaffold. In the process, several new everninomicin analogues were generated.







Abstract
Everninomicins are orthoester oligosaccharide antibiotics with potent activity against multidrug&#8208;resistant bacterial pathogens. Everninomicins act by disrupting ribosomal assembly in a distinct region in comparison to clinically prescribed drugs. We employed microporous intergeneric conjugation with Escherichia coli to manipulate Micromonospora for targeted gene&#8208;replacement studies of multiple putative methyltransferases across the octasaccharide scaffold of everninomicin effecting the A1, C, F, and H rings. Analyses of gene&#8208;replacement and genetic complementation mutants established the mutability of the everninomicin scaffold through the generation of 12 previously unreported analogues and, together with previous results, permitted assignment of the ten methyltransferases required for everninomicin biosynthesis. The in&#8197;vitro activity of A1&#8208; and H&#8208;ring&#8208;modifying methyltransferases demonstrated the ability to catalyze late&#8208;stage modification of the scaffold on an A1&#8208;ring phenol and H&#8208;ring C&#8208;4&#8217; hydroxy moiety. Together these results establish the potential of the everninomicin scaffold for modification through mutagenesis and in&#8197;vitro modification of advanced biosynthetic intermediates.

Trojan horse strategy: Glycocluster&#8208;siderophores were synthesised to target LecA and LecB lectins contained in the outer membrane and inside the bacterium of P.&#8197;aeruginosa. The galactoclusters with catechol moieties were able to hijack the iron transport and exhibit a inhibitory effect. This result shows that LecA localised in the outer membrane of P. aeruginosa is involved in the infection process.







Abstract
Galacto&#8208; and fuco&#8208;clusters conjugated with one to three catechol or hydroxamate motifs were synthesised to target LecA and LecB lectins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) localised in the outer membrane and inside the bacterium. The resulting glycocluster&#8211;pseudosiderophore conjugates were evaluated as Trojan horses to cross the outer membrane of PA by iron transport. The data suggest that glycoclusters with catechol moieties are able to hijack the iron transport, whereas those with hydroxamates showed strong nonspecific interactions. Mono&#8208; and tricatechol galactoclusters (G1C and G3C) were evaluated as inhibitors of infection by PA in comparison with the free galactocluster (G0). All of them exhibited an inhibitory effect between 46 to 75&#8201;% at 100&#8197;&#956;M, with a higher potency than G0. This result shows that LecA localised in the outer membrane of PA is involved in the infection mechanism.

         <title>Peptidyl Acyloxymethyl Ketones as Activity&#8208;Based Probes for the Main Protease of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2**

Probe goes viral. The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease is an attractive drug target to combat the causative agent of covid19. We report activity&#8208;based probes of this protease that are selective even in the presence of a human proteome. These reagents will allow detection of the Mpro as well as verification of target engagement by antiviral drugs against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.







Abstract
The global pandemic caused by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 calls for the fast development of antiviral drugs against this particular coronavirus. Chemical tools to facilitate inhibitor discovery as well as detection of target engagement by hit or lead compounds from high&#8208;throughput screens are therefore in urgent need. We here report novel, selective activity&#8208;based probes that enable detection of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease. The probes are based on acyloxymethyl ketone reactive electrophiles combined with a peptide sequence including unnatural amino acids that targets the nonprimed site of the main protease substrate binding cleft. They are the first activity&#8208;based probes for the main protease of coronaviruses and display target labeling within a human proteome without background. We expect that these reagents will be useful in the drug&#8208;development pipeline, not only for the current SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, but also for other coronaviruses.

We expect that these reagents will be useful in the drug&#8208;development pipeline, not only for the current SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, but also for other coronaviruses.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Enzymatic Construction of Artificial Base Pairs: The Effect of Metal Shielding</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 21, Issue 23, Page 3398-3409, December 1, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A, C, G, T&#8230; Ag, Cr: We have explored using nucleotides bearing methylated imidazole base surrogates to expand the genetic alphabet with artificial metal base pairs. This methylation pattern improves silver&#8208;mediated base pair formation compared to the unmodified imidiazole nucleotide. We extended this approach to underexplored metal ions and observed the formation of a chromium&#8208;mediated metal base pair.







Abstract
Th formation of metal base pairs is a versatile method for the introduction of metal cations into nucleic acids that has been used in numerous applications including the construction of metal nanowires, development of energy, charge&#8208;transfer devices and expansion of the genetic alphabet. As an alternative, enzymatic construction of metal base pairs is an alluring strategy that grants access to longer sequences and offers the possibility of using such unnatural base pairs (UBPs) in SELEX experiments for the identification of functional nucleic acids. This method remains rather underexplored, and a better understanding of the key parameters in the design of efficient nucleotides is required. We have investigated the effect of methylation of the imidazole nucleoside (dImnMeTP) on the efficiency of the enzymatic construction of metal base pairs. The presence of methyl substituents on dImTP facilitates the polymerase&#8208;driven formation of dIm4Me&#8722;AgI&#8722;dIm and dIm2MeTP&#8722;CrIII&#8722;dIm base pairs. Steric factors rather than the basicity of the imidazole nucleobase appear to govern the enzymatic formation of such metal base pairs. We also demonstrate the compatibility of other metal cations rarely considered in the construction of artificial metal bases by enzymatic DNA synthesis under both primer extension reaction and PCR conditions. These findings open up new directions for the design of nucleotide analogues for the development of metal base pairs.

One target, more options. The toolbox of high&#8208;affinity ligands for clinically relevant proteins is continuously expanding. Covalent conjugates of these ligands with drugs, radiotracers and other bioactive agents are being studied for therapy and imaging. The pharmacokinetic properties, chemical accessibility and versatility are just a few examples of the positive features that could bring targeted small molecule conjugates to a leading role in future medicine.







Abstract
In recent years, novel classes of small hetero&#8208;bifunctional compounds have been developed as tools for the treatment of cancer and other diseases through different approaches, from radio/chemotherapy and imaging to immunotherapy and protein degradation. Within this growing research area, progresses in ligand&#8208;screening procedures and hit&#8208;to&#8208;lead optimizations, together with advances in drug&#8208;release technologies, are paving the way to the future treatment of a broad range of pathologies with small targeted therapeutics.

Interacting with interactions: Chemical proteomics has taken shape as a powerful technique that seeks to understand small&#8208;molecule and protein function in the physiological system. Chemical proteomics that integrates activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) technology with mass spectrometry has been introduced to evaluate small&#8208;molecule and protein interaction and expand the druggable proteome.







Abstract
Abstract. Over the past decade, chemical proteomics has emerged as a powerful technique to understand small molecule and protein function in the physiological system and plays a key role in unravelling the cellular targets of pharmacological modulators. Chemical proteomics that integrates activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) with mass spectrometry has been introduced to evaluate small&#8208;molecule and protein interaction and expand the druggable proteome. A much larger fraction of the human proteome can now be targeted by small molecules than estimated by past predictions of protein druggability.

A cell&#8208;like structure or protocell emerges spontaneously by simply mixing DNAs, phospholipids and two kinds of hydrophilic macromolecules: PEG and dextran (DEX). The top middle picture shows a water/water microdroplet (the DEX&#8208;rich phase surrounded by the PEG&#8208;rich phase) generated through the depletion effect of the different macromolecules. By the addition of DNAs to the solution, the DEX&#8208;rich droplet autonomously takes DNAs inside (see the droplet bottom right). In the coexistence of phospholipids, they cover the droplets, and a stable phospholipid vesicle entrapping DNAs appears in a self&#8208;organized manner (see the protocell bottom left). More information can be found in the communication by K. Takiguchi, K. Tsumoto, et&#8197;al.

A mock video game of pandemic outbreaks illustrates how scientists around the globe with various resources are tackling missions in the combat against Covid&#8208;19. In their full paper, S.&#8197;H.&#8197;L. Verhelst et&#8197;al. describe the development of an activity&#8208;based probe to selectively detect the active Main protease of SARS&#8208;CoV2. This probe is armed with a cysteine&#8208;reactive acyloxymethyl ketone warhead and a substrate&#8208;based peptide skeleton that allow it to detect the protease even in a complex human proteome.

         <title>Recent Progress in the Synthesis of Homogeneous Erythropoietin (EPO) Glycoforms</title>

Getting just what you want: The FDA&#8208;approved glycoprotein erythropoietin (EPO) is an important therapeutic agent and is manufactured by using recombinant protein synthesis, generating a mixture of glycoforms. We highlight recent alternative approaches employing chemical protein synthesis or semisynthesis that produce a single EPO glycoform, thus allowing the roles of the glycans to be more fully understood.







Abstract
Erythropoietin (EPO) has been regarded as a therapeutic glycoprotein for the clinical treatment of anaemia since its approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1989. Commercial production of the 165&#8208;residue glycoprotein is by recombinant protein expression using mammalian cell lines that renders a complex mixture of glycoforms that have an identical amino acid sequence but variations in the structures of the pendant glycans. This heterogeneous nature of human recombinant EPO restricts structural and bioactivity studies in medicinal chemistry. Consequently, chemical synthesis provides an elegant approach for the preparation of complex homogeneous glycoproteins from a readily accessible pool of amino acids and sugars. In addition, the combination of chemical and biosynthesis enables robust and large&#8208;scale production of homogeneous EPO. The scope of this minireview is to summarise the recent advances in the chemical and semisyntheses of homogeneous EPO glycoforms, highlighting the versatile approaches to the preparation and structural manipulations of the carbohydrate chains incorporated into synthetic EPO glycoproteins.

Vaccine variations: This article reviews the utility of genetic code expansion as an emerging tool for the development of vaccines. It highlights how the incorporation of immunogenic noncanonical amino acids (ncAA) can aid in eliciting immune responses against adverse self&#8208;proteins and highlights the potential of an expanded genetic code for the construction of live&#8208;attenuated virus vaccines.







Abstract
Abstract: By providing long&#8208;term protection against infectious diseases, vaccinations have significantly reduced death and morbidity worldwide. In the 21st century, (bio)technological advances have paved the way for developing prophylactic vaccines that are safer and more effective as well as enabling the use of vaccines as therapeutics to treat human diseases. Here, we provide a focused review of the utility of genetic code expansion as an emerging tool for the development of vaccines. Specifically, we discuss how the incorporation of immunogenic noncanonical amino acids can aid in eliciting immune responses against adverse self&#8208;proteins and highlight the potential of an expanded genetic code for the construction of replication&#8208;incompetent viruses. We close the review by discussing the future prospects and remaining challenges for the application of these approaches in the development of both prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines in the near future.

Revised: Kasumigamide (1) is an antialgal hybrid peptide&#8208;polyketide isolated from the freshwater cyanobacterium M. aeruginosa (NIES&#8208;87). The biosynthetic gene cluster was identified from not only the cyanobacterium but also a sponge symbiont. We now report synthetic studies on this intriguing natural product, leading to the structural revision, the first total synthesis, and identification of a new analogue of 1.







Abstract
Kasumigamide is an antialgal hybrid peptide&#8211;polyketide isolated from the freshwater cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa (NIES&#8208;87). The biosynthetic gene cluster was identified from not only the cyanobacterium but also Candidatus &#8220;Entotheonella&#8221;, associated with the Japanese marine sponge Discodermia calyx. Therefore, kasumigamide is considered to play a key role in microbial ecology, regardless of the terrestrial and marine habitats. We now report synthetic studies on this intriguing natural product that have led to a structural revision and the first total synthesis. During this study, a new analogue, deoxykasumigamide, was also isolated and structurally validated. This study confirmed the presence of the unusual pathway in the biosynthesis of a hybrid peptide&#8211;polyketide natural product.

         <title>Self&#8208;Emergent Protocells Generated in an Aqueous Solution with Binary Macromolecules through Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation</title>

Cell&#8208;like microdroplet entrapping DNA wrapped by a lipid layer: Cell&#8208;sized droplets were generated through liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) by adapting a PEG/dextran binary solution. They accumulated phospholipids on their surface and entrapped DNA in a self&#8208;organized manner.







Abstract
Recently, liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) has attracted considerable attention among researchers in the life sciences as a plausible mechanism for the generation of microstructures inside cells. LLPS occurs through multiple nonspecific interactions and does not always require a lock&#8208;and&#8208;key interaction with a binary macromolecular solution. The remarkable features of LLPS include the non&#8208;uniform localization and concentration of solutes, resulting in the ability to isolate certain chemical systems and thereby parallelize multiple chemical reactions within the limited space of a living cell. We report that, by using the macromolecules, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and dextran, that exhibit LLPS in an aqueous solution, cell&#8208;sized liposomes are spontaneously formed therein in the presence of phospholipids. In this system, LLPS is generated through the depletion effect of macromolecules. The results showed that cell&#8208;like microdroplets entrapping DNA wrapped by a phospholipid layer emerge in a self&#8208;organized manner.

         <title>Lanthanide Tagging of Oligonucleotides to Nucleobase for Paramagnetic NMR</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 21, Issue 23, Page 3333-3337, December 1, 2020. </description>

Get more from your NMR: Two paramagnetic tags, Cys&#8208;Ph&#8208;TAHA (top) and MesS&#8208;Ph&#8208;TAHA (bottom) that can be connected to a nucleobase for DNA tagging are introduced. Loaded with several lanthanides, they provide pseudocontact shifts and residual dipolar couplings that can be used for structure refinement and dynamics studies.







Abstract
Although lanthanide tags, which have large anisotropic magnetic susceptibilities, have already been introduced to enrich NMR parameters by long&#8208;range pseudoconact shifts (PCSs) and residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) of proteins, their application to nucleotides has so far been limited to one previous report, due to the high affinities of lanthanides for the phosphodiester backbone of nucleotides and difficult organic synthesis. Herein, we report successful attachment of a lanthanide tag to a chemically synthesized oligonucleotide via a disulfide bond. NMR experiments reveal PCSs of up to 1&#8197;ppm and H&#8722;H RDCs of up to 8&#8197;Hz at 950&#8197;MHz. Although weaker magnetic alignment was achieved than with proteins, the paramagnetic data could be fitted to the known structure of the DNA, taking the mobility of the tag into account. While further rigidification of the tag is desirable, this tag could also be used to measure heteronuclear RDCs of 13C,15N&#8208;labeled chemically synthesized DNA and RNA.

         <title>Efficient assay for the detection of hydrogen peroxide via estimation of the enzyme promiscuous activity in the perhydrolysis reaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen peroxide is an ideal oxidant in the view of availability, atom&#8208;economy, or green aspects. Furthermore, it is produced by the cell mitochondria and plays a meaningful role in controlling the physiological processes, but unregulated production leads to the destruction of organs. Due to its diverse roles, a fast and selective method for hydrogen peroxide detection is the major limitation to prevent the negative effects caused by its excess. Therefore, we aimed to develop an efficient assay for the detection of H2O2. For this purpose, we combined the enzymatic method for the detection of hydrogen peroxide via the estimation of the promiscuity of various enzymes. We estimated the activity of an enzyme in the reaction of p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters with hydrogen peroxide resulting in the peracid formation. According to our knowledge, there is no example of a simple, multi&#8208;sensor demonstrating the promiscuous activity of an enzyme and detecting the hydrogen peroxide in the aqueous media.</dc:description>

         <title>A MIF&#8208;Derived Cyclopeptide that Inhibits MIF Binding and Atherogenic Signaling via the Chemokine Receptor CXCR2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The specific targeting of the interaction between the atypical chemokine MIF and its receptor CXCR2, and its atherosclerosis&#8208;promoting activity in a tailored peptide&#8208;based approach is illustrated. Based on a structure&#8211;activity analysis of short N&#8208;like loop&#8208;derived MIF peptides, the cyclic MIF peptide analogue MIF(cyclo10) was identified as a promising candidate that blocks MIF/CXCR2 and counteracts MIF's inflammatory and pro&#8208;atherogenic activity.







Abstract
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an inflammatory cytokine and atypical chemokine with a key role in inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis. Key atherogenic functions of MIF are mediated by noncognate interaction with the chemokine receptor CXCR2. The MIF N&#8208;like loop comprising the sequence 47&#8211;56 is an important structural determinant of the MIF/CXCR2 interface and MIF(47&#8211;56) blocks atherogenic MIF activities. However, the mechanism and critical structure&#8211;activity information within this sequence have remained elusive. Here, we show that MIF(47&#8211;56) directly binds to CXCR2 to compete with MIF receptor activation. By using alanine scanning, essential and dispensable residues were identified. Moreover, MIF(cyclo10), a designed cyclized variant of MIF(47&#8211;56), inhibited key inflammatory and atherogenic MIF activities in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo/ex vivo, and exhibited strongly improved resistance to proteolytic degradation in human plasma in&#8197;vitro, thus suggesting that it could serve as a promising basis for MIF&#8208;derived anti&#8208;atherosclerotic peptides.

         <title>CYP154C5 Regioselectivity in Steroid Hydroxylation Explored by Substrate Modifications and Protein Engineering**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Changes in selectivity: Using substrate and protein engineering based on key residues and functional groups, the regioselectivity of the bacterial cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP154C5 in the hydroxylation of different steroids was altered. Apart from 16&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation, steroid products containing hydroxy groups in 15&#945; and 21 position were formed.







Abstract
CYP154C5 from Nocardia farcinica is a P450 monooxygenase able to hydroxylate a range of steroids with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity at the 16&#945;&#8208;position. Using protein engineering and substrate modifications based on the crystal structure of CYP154C5, an altered regioselectivity of the enzyme in steroid hydroxylation had been achieved. Thus, conversion of progesterone by mutant CYP154C5 F92A resulted in formation of the corresponding 21&#8208;hydroxylated product 11&#8208;deoxycorticosterone in addition to 16&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation. Using MD simulation, this altered regioselectivity appeared to result from an alternative binding mode of the steroid in the active site of mutant F92A. MD simulation further suggested that the entrance of water to the active site caused higher uncoupling in this mutant. Moreover, exclusive 15&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation was observed for wild&#8208;type CYP154C5 in the conversion of 5&#945;&#8208;androstan&#8208;3&#8208;one, lacking an oxy&#8208;functional group at C17. Overall, our data give valuable insight into the structure&#8211;function relationship of this cytochrome P450 monooxygenase for steroid hydroxylation.

         <title>Characterization of New DNA Aptamers for Anti&#8208;HIV&#8208;1 Reverse Transcriptase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA aptamers are the new approach for anti&#8208;HIV&#8208;1 RT. These aptamers were isolated by the use of a DNA library complexed to WT HIV&#8208;1 RT. The selected DNA aptamers showed an inhibitory effect on the polymerase reaction of HIV&#8208;1 RTs (WT and KY mutant). NMR spectroscopy showed that the aptamer induced a conformational change in HIV&#8208;1 RT&#8242;s structure.







Abstract
HIV&#8208;1 RT is a necessary enzyme for retroviral replication, which is the main target for antiviral therapy against AIDS. Effective anti&#8208;HIV&#8208;1 RT drugs are divided into two groups; nucleoside inhibitors (NRTI) and non&#8208;nucleoside inhibitors (NNRTI), which inhibit DNA polymerase. In this study, new DNA aptamers were isolated as anti&#8208;HIV&#8208;1 RT inhibitors. The selected DNA aptamer (WT62) presented with high affinity and inhibition against wild&#8208;type (WT) HIV&#8208;1 RT and gave a KD value of 75.10&#177;0.29&#8197;nM and an IC50 value of 84.81&#177;8.54&#8197;nM. Moreover, WT62 decreased the DNA polymerase function of K103&#8197;N/Y181&#8197;C double mutant (KY) HIV&#8208;1 RT by around 80&#8201;%. Furthermore, the ITC results showed that this aptamer has small binding enthalpies with both WT and KY HIV&#8208;1 RTs through which the complex might form a hydrophobic interaction or noncovalent bonding. The NMR result also suggested that the WT62 aptamer could bind with both WT and KY mutant HIV&#8208;1 RTs at the connection domain.

         <title>The Peculiar Case of the Hyperthermostable Pyrimidine Nucleoside Phosphorylase from Thermus thermophilus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The poor solubility of many nucleosides and nucleobases in aqueous solution demands harsh reaction conditions (base, heat, cosolvent) in nucleoside phosphorylase&#8208;catalyzed processes to facilitate substrate loading beyond the low millimolar range. This, in turn, requires enzymes which withstand these conditions. Herein we report that the pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase from  Thermus thermophilus  is active over an exceptionally broad pH (4&#8722;10), temperature (up to 100&#160;&#176;C) and cosolvent space (up to 80% (v/v) non&#8208;aqueous medium) and displays tremendous stability under harsh reaction conditions with predicted total turnover numbers of more than 10  6  for various pyrimidine nucleosides. However, its use as a biocatalyst for preparative applications is critically limited due to its inhibition by nucleobases at low concentrations, which is unprecedented among non&#8208;specific pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylases.</dc:description>

         <title>Millisecond Allosteric Dynamics of Activated Ras Reproduced with a Slowly Hydrolyzable GTP Analogue</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slowly does it: The correlated internal motions of GTP&#947;S&#8208;bound Ras have been quantified using relaxation dispersion NMR spectroscopy with site&#8208;specific details, demonstrating its accurate preservation of the physiological dynamics network critical for the binding of allosteric ligands.







Abstract
The millisecond timescale dynamics of activated Ras transiently sample a low&#8208;populated conformational state that has distinct surface property from the major state and represents a promising target for binding of small&#8208;molecule compounds. To avoid the complications of hydrolysis, dynamics and other properties of active Ras have so far been routinely investigated by using non&#8208;hydrolyzable GTP analogues, which, however, were previously reported to alter both the kinetics and distribution of the conformational exchange. In this study, we quantitatively measured and validated the internal dynamics of Ras complexed with a slowly hydrolyzable GTP analogue, GTP&#947;S, which increases the lifetime of active Ras by 23 times relative to that of native GTP.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Slowly does it&lt;/b&gt;: The correlated internal motions of GTP&#947;S&#8208;bound Ras have been quantified using relaxation dispersion NMR spectroscopy with site&#8208;specific details, demonstrating its accurate preservation of the physiological dynamics network critical for the binding of allosteric ligands.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The millisecond timescale dynamics of activated Ras transiently sample a low&#8208;populated conformational state that has distinct surface property from the major state and represents a promising target for binding of small&#8208;molecule compounds. To avoid the complications of hydrolysis, dynamics and other properties of active Ras have so far been routinely investigated by using non&#8208;hydrolyzable GTP analogues, which, however, were previously reported to alter both the kinetics and distribution of the conformational exchange. In this study, we quantitatively measured and validated the internal dynamics of Ras complexed with a slowly hydrolyzable GTP analogue, GTP&#947;S, which increases the lifetime of active Ras by 23 times relative to that of native GTP. It was found that GTP&#947;S, in addition to its better mimicking of the exchange kinetics than the commonly used non&#8208;hydrolyzable analogues GppNHp and GppCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;p, can rigorously reproduce the natural dynamics network in active Ras, thus indicating its fitness for use in the development of allosteric inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Biological Relevance of RGD&#8208;Integrin Subtype&#8208;Specific Ligands in Cancer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Specific ligands for the right integrin in the right tumor: RGD&#8208;integrins &#945;v&#946;3 and &#945;5&#946;1 are the most studied in cancer. Despite similarities in extracellular matrix recognition, integrin expression and function can differ from one tumor to another. Ligands highly selective for each subtype represent a breakthrough to understand their particularities and to specifically address their respective functions in tumors.







Abstract
Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane proteins able to connect cells with the micro&#8208;environment. They represent a family of receptors involved in almost all the hallmarks of cancer. Integrins recognizing the Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp (RGD) peptide in their natural extracellular matrix ligands have been particularly investigated as tumoral therapeutic targets. In the last 30&#8197;years, intense research has been dedicated to designing specific RGD&#8208;like ligands able to discriminate selectively the different RGD&#8208;recognizing integrins. Chemists&#8242; efforts have led to the proposition of modified peptide or peptidomimetic libraries to be used for tumor targeting and/or tumor imaging. Here we review, from the biological point of view, the rationale underlying the need to clearly delineate each RGD&#8208;integrin subtype by selective tools. We describe the complex roles of RGD&#8208;integrins (mainly the most studied &#945;v&#946;3 and &#945;5&#946;1 integrins) in tumors, the steps towards selective ligands and the current usefulness of such ligands. Although the impact of integrins in cancer is well acknowledged, the biological characteristics of each integrin subtype in a specific tumor are far from being completely resolved. Selective ligands might help us to reconsider integrins as therapeutic targets in specific clinical settings.

         <title>The Impact of Halogenated Phenylalanine Derivatives on NFGAIL Amyloid Formation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As shown for the model peptide NFGAIL, the introduction of different fluorinated phenylalanine derivatives leads to specific amyloid&#8208;folding kinetics through an alteration in hydrophobicity and changes in their &#945;&#8208;frameworks. This is represented by the clock, as its hand (the &#8220;F&#8221; for fluorine) determines the self&#8208;assembly process. The extent of fluorination, illustrated as potential plots, acts as a dimension of change not only for aggregation kinetics, but also for the morphology of resulting fibrils, as revealed by TEM micrographs. More information can be found in the full paper by B. Koksch et&#8197;al. The picture was created by S.C., Helmut Fouquet, J.M., M.B., R.R.N. and B.K.

         <title>Cyclotide Structures Revealed by NMR, with a Little Help from X&#8208;ray Crystallography</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclotides are a fascinating class of macrocyclic plant peptides that contain a cyclic cystine knot, a compact and highly stable structural motif. This review by D.&#8197;J. Craik and co&#8208;authors is an historical overview of the developments in NMR spectroscopy, as well as X&#8208;ray crystallography, that have enabled the resolution of cyclotide structures and conclusive determination of disulfide connectivities of several exemplar cyclotides. Such work has been inspired by the innovative and pioneering studies of Professor Horst Kessler in cyclic peptide chemistry and NMR spectroscopy. Cover art by P.J.H.

         <title>Antimicrobial and Anticancer Properties of Synthetic Peptides Derived from the Wasp Parachartergus fraternus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Agelaia&#8208;MPI and protonectin are antimicrobial peptides isolated from the wasp  Parachartergus fraternus  that show antimicrobial and neuroactive activities. Previously, two analogues of these peptides, neuroVAL and protonectin&#8208;F were designed to reduce nonspecific toxicity and improve potency. Here, the three&#8208;dimensional structures of neuroVAL, protonectin and protonectin&#8208;F were determined using circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy. Antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic and hemolytic activities were tested for the parent peptides and analogues. All peptides showed moderate antimicrobial activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, with agelaia&#8208;MPI being the most active. Protonectin and protonectin&#8208;F were found to be toxic to cancerous and non&#8208;cancerous cell lines. Internalization experiments revealed that these peptides accumulate inside both cell types. By contrast, neuroVAL was nontoxic to all tested cells and was able to enter cells without accumulating. In summary, neuroVAL has potential as a non&#8208;toxic cell penetrating peptide, while protonectin&#8208;F needs further modification to realize its potential as an antitumor peptide.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrahedral DNA Nanoconjugates for Simultaneous Measurement of Telomerase Activity and miRNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, tetrahedral DNA nanostructure is firstly self&#8208;assembled, which is then conjugated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and carbon nanodots (CDs). The fabricated nanocomposites allow simultaneous analysis of telomerase activity and miRNA with dual fluorescence channels. By further introducing iRGD peptide sequence, the nanoconjuates can be conveniently transferred inside living cells for in situ imaging. The analytical performances and anti&#8208;jamming capabilities are excellent. Meanwhile, the materials are highly biocompatible for intracellular applications. Therefore, the proposed biosystem shows great promise as a powerful tool for quantitative analysis of the dual biomarkers. The strategy can also be further exploited as a versatile platform for in situ detection of many other targets for early diagnosis of related diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Dioxane and Morpholino Nucleotide Analogues: Syntheses and RNA&#8208;Hybridization Properties</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards synthetic oligonucleotides: Starting from the 4&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;modified ribose derivative (1), synthetic routes to two novel nucleoside analogues with dioxane and morpholine central scaffolds were developed and realized in two diastereomeric series. The final phosphoramidites were incorporated into an artificial RNA double strand, and the thermal stabilities were determined by melting temperature analysis.







Abstract
A novel class of nucleotide analogues with a dioxane ring as central scaffold has been developed. Synthetic routes in two diastereomeric series were realized, and the final thymidine analogues were synthesized with common functionalities for the automated oligonucleotide synthesis. The chemical space of the initially derived nucleotides was expanded by changing the central dioxane to analogous morpholine derivatives. This opens up the possibility for further derivatization by attaching different substituents at the morpholine nitrogen. The novel nucleotide building blocks were incorporated into double&#8208;stranded RNA sequences, and their hybridization properties investigated by melting&#8208;temperature analysis. Both scaffolds, dioxanes and morpholines, had an equal impact on double&#8208;strand stability, but Tm values differed depending on the chirality in the six&#8208;membered ring.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel class of nucleotide analogues with a dioxane ring as central scaffold has been developed. Synthetic routes in two diastereomeric series were realized, and the final thymidine analogues were synthesized with common functionalities for the automated oligonucleotide synthesis. The chemical space of the initially derived nucleotides was expanded by changing the central dioxane to analogous morpholine derivatives. This opens up the possibility for further derivatization by attaching different substituents at the morpholine nitrogen. The novel nucleotide building blocks were incorporated into double&#8208;stranded RNA sequences, and their hybridization properties investigated by melting&#8208;temperature analysis. Both scaffolds, dioxanes and morpholines, had an equal impact on double&#8208;strand stability, but &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; values differed depending on the chirality in the six&#8208;membered ring.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Regulation of Lipid Bilayer Ion Permeability by Antibacterial Polymethyloxazoline&#8208;Polyethyleneimine Copolymers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>

Coming through: The black lipid membrane technique was used to investigate the membrane&#8208;permeabilization abilities of a series of amphiphilic antimicrobial polymers. The most potent antibacterial polymer induces step&#8208;like current behavior typical for an ion&#8208;channel.







Abstract
Amphiphilic antimicrobial polymers display activity against the outer bacterial cell membrane, triggering various physiological effects. We investigated the regulation of ion transport across the lipid bilayer to understand differences in biological activity for a series of amphiphilic polymethyloxazoline &#8211; polyethyleneimine copolymers. The results confirmed that the tested structures were able to increase the permeability of the lipid bilayer (LB) membrane or its rupture. Black lipid membrane (BLM) experiments show that the triggered conductance profile and its character is strongly correlated with the polymer structure and zeta potential. The polymer exhibiting the highest antimicrobial activity promotes ion transport by using a unique mechanism and step&#8208;like characteristics with well&#8208;defined discreet openings and closings. The molecule was incorporated into the membrane in a reproducible way, and the observed channel&#8208;like activity could be responsible for the antibacterial activity of this molecule.

         <title>Microenvironment&#8208;Sensitive Fluorescent Ligand Binds Ascaris Telomere Antiparallel G&#8208;Quadruplex DNA with Blue&#8208;Shift and Enhanced Emission</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective G4 DNA ligands: We report a novel microenvironment&#8208;sensitive fluorescent ligand (Q1) that shows selectivity to ascaris telomere antiparallel G4 DNA ASC20 through enhanced fluorescence intensity along with about 18&#8197;nm blue&#8208;shifted properties. The detailed interactions of Q1 with ASC20 G4 DNA are illustrated, and the results demonstrate that Q1 mainly binds at the terminals of ASC20 through an end&#8208;stacking mode.







Abstract
The development of small molecules that can selectively target G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNAs has drawn considerable attention due to their unique physiological and pathological functions. However, only a few molecules have been found to selectively bind a particular G4 DNA structure. We have developed a fluorescence ligand Q1, a molecular scaffold with a carbazole&#8211;pyridine core bridged by a phenylboronic acid side chain, that acts as a selective ascaris telomere antiparallel G4 DNA ASC20 ligand with about 18&#8197;nm blue&#8208;shifted and enhanced fluorescence intensity. Photophysical properties revealed that Q1 was sensitive to the microenvironment and gave the best selectivity to ASC20 with an equilibrium binding constant Ka=6.04&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence studies also demonstrated that Q1 showed a longer fluorescence lifetime in the presence of ASC20. The binding characteristics of Q1 with ASC20 were shown in detail in a fluorescent intercalator displacement (FID) assay, a 2&#8208;Ap titration experiment and by molecular docking. Ligand Q1 could adopt an appropriate pose at terminal G&#8208;quartets of ASC20 through multiple interactions including &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking between aromatic rings; this led to strong fluorescence enhancement. In addition, a co&#8208;staining image showed that Q1 is mainly distributed in the cytoplasm. Accordingly, this work provides insights for the development of ligands that selectively targeting a specific G4 DNA structure.

         <title>Quinone Methide&#8208;Based Organophosphate Hydrolases Inhibitors: Trans Proximity Labelers versus Cis Labeling Activity&#8208;Based Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Internal affairs: Phosphoester substrates that release electrophilic quinone&#8208;methides were applied as activity&#8208;based probes in three phosphotriesterases that differ in mechanism and level of activity. Their substrates&#8242; reactivity, and mode of labeling, were systematically investigated with the aim of achieving specific cis labeling rather than trans.







Abstract
Quinone methide (QM) chemistry is widely applied including in enzyme inhibitors. Typically, enzyme&#8208;mediated bond breaking releases a phenol product that rearranges into an electrophilic QM that in turn covalently modifies protein side chains. However, the factors that govern the reactivity of QM&#8208;based inhibitors and their mode of inhibition have not been systematically explored. Foremost, enzyme inactivation might occur in cis, whereby a QM molecule inactivates the very same enzyme molecule that released it, or by trans if the released QMs diffuse away and inactivate other enzyme molecules. We examined QM&#8208;based inhibitors for enzymes exhibiting phosphoester hydrolase activity. We tested different phenolic substituents and benzylic leaving groups, thereby modulating the rates of enzymatic hydrolysis, phenolate&#8208;to&#8208;QM rearrangement, and the electrophilicity of the resulting QM. By developing assays that distinguish between cis and trans inhibition, we have identified certain combinations of leaving groups and phenyl substituents that lead to inhibition in the cis mode, while other combinations gave trans inhibition. Our results suggest that cis&#8208;acting QM&#8208;based substrates could be used as activity&#8208;based probes to identify various phospho&#8208; and phosphono&#8208;ester hydrolases, and potentially other hydrolases.

         <title>Stepwise Strategy for One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Single&#8208;Stranded DNA Rings from Multiple Short Fragments</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One at a time, please: Large, circular, single&#8208;stranded DNAs (up to 452&#8208;nt sizes) have been efficiently prepared from multiple linear, single&#8208;stranded short DNA fragments by using T4 DNA ligase through sequential addition of different sets of splints in a one&#8208;pot reaction. The lengths of splints and the order of splint addition were optimized to obtain a satisfying yield of c&#8208;ssDNA products. This method is convenient and practical, and benefits the development of DNA nanotechnology and bioscience.







Abstract
Cyclic rings of single&#8208;stranded (ss) DNA have various unique properties, but wider applications have been hampered by their poor availability. This paper reports a convenient one&#8208;pot method in which these rings are efficiently synthesized by using T4 DNA ligase through convergent cyclization of easily available short DNA fragments. The key to the present method is to separate all the splint oligonucleotides into several sets, and add each set sequentially at an appropriate interval to the solutions containing all the short DNA fragments. Compared with simple one&#8208;pot strategies involving simultaneous addition of all the splints at the beginning of the reaction, both the selectivity and the yields of target ssDNA rings are greatly improved. This convergent method is especially useful for preparing large&#8208;sized rings that are otherwise hard to obtain. By starting from six short DNA fragments (71&#8211;82&#8197;nt), prepared by a DNA synthesizer, a ssDNA ring of 452&#8208;nt size was synthesized in 35&#8197;mol&#8201;% yield and in high selectivity. Satisfactorily pure DNA rings were obtainable simply by treating the crude products with exonuclease.

         <title>Fluorescent Peptide Biosensor for Probing CDK6 Kinase Activity in Lung Cancer Cell Extracts</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Distinguished kinases: We describe the design, engineering and characterisation of a fluorescent peptide biosensor derived from 6&#8208;phosphofructokinase, that reports on CDK6 kinase activity in&#8197;vitro and in lung cancer cell extracts. Implementation of this biosensor in mesothelioma cell lines derived from patients highlights differences between CDK6 kinase activity and closely related CDK4 kinase activity.







Abstract
CDK6 kinase regulates cell&#8208;cycle progression in G1, together with CDK4, but has cell&#8208;, tissue&#8208; and developmentally distinct functions associated with transcription, angiogenesis and metabolism.

&lt;p&gt;CDK6 kinase regulates cell&#8208;cycle progression in G1, together with CDK4, but has cell&#8208;, tissue&#8208; and developmentally distinct functions associated with transcription, angiogenesis and metabolism. Although CDK6 makes an attractive cancer biomarker and target, there are no means of assessing its activity in a complex environment. In this study, we describe the design, engineering and characterisation of a fluorescent peptide biosensor derived from 6&#8208;phosphofructokinase that reports on CDK6 kinase activity through sensitive changes in fluorescence intensity. This biosensor can report on CDK6 activity in a dose&#8208;dependent fashion, thereby enabling quantification of differences in kinase activity in complex and physiologically relevant environments. Further implementation of this biosensor in different lung and melanoma cell lines, as well as in mesothelioma cell lines derived from patients together with a CDK4 biosensor highlighted differences in kinase activity between CDK6 and CDK4 kinase.

         <title>Expanding the Toolbox of (R)&#8208;selective Amine Transaminases by Identification and Characterization of new Members</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amine transaminases (ATAs) are used to synthesize enantiomerically pure amines, which are building blocks for pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.  (R)  &#8208;selective ATAs belong to the fold type IV PLP dependent enzymes and different sequence&#8208;, structure&#8208; and substrate scope&#8208;based features have been identified in the past decade. However, our knowledge is still restricted due to the limited number of characterized  (R)  &#8208;ATAs with additional bias towards fungal origin. We aimed to expand the toolbox of  (R)  &#8208;ATAs and contribute to the understanding of this enzyme subfamily. We identified and characterized four new  (R)  &#8208;ATAs. The ATA from  Exophiala sideris  contains a motif characteristic for D&#8208;ATAs, which was previously believed to be a disqualifying factor for  (R)  &#8208;ATA activity. The crystal structure of the ATA from  Shinella  is the first from a gram&#8208;negative bacterium. The ATAs from  Pseudonocardia acaciae  and  Tetrasphaera japonica  are the first characterized  (R)  &#8208;ATAs with a shortened/missing N&#8208;terminal helix. The active site charges vary significantly between the new and known ATAs correlating with their diverging substrate scope.</dc:description>

         <title>&#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin encapsulation of synthetic AHLs: drug delivery implications and quorum&#8208;quenching exploits.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, regulate phenotypic switching in a population density&#8208;dependent manner through a phenomenon known as quorum sensing (QS). For Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, QS relies on the synthesis, transmission, and perception of low molecular weight signal molecules that are predominantly N&#8208;acyl&#8208;L&#8208;homoserine lactones (AHLs). Efforts to disrupt AHL&#8208;mediated QS have largely focused on the development of synthetic AHL analogues (SAHLAs) that are structurally similar to native AHLs. However, like AHLs, these molecules tend to be hydrophobic and are poorly soluble under aqueous conditions. Water&#8208;soluble macrocycles, such as cyclodextrins (CDs), that encapsulate hydrophobic guests, have long been used by both agricultural and pharmaceutical industries to overcome solubility issues associated with hydrophobic compounds of interest. Conveniently, CDs have also demonstrated anti&#8208;AHL&#8208;mediated QS effects. Here, using fluorescence spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, and mass spectrometry, we evaluate the affinity of SAHLAs, as well as their hydrolysis products, for &#946;&#8208;CD inclusion. We also evaluated the ability of these complexes to inhibit wildtype P. aeruginosa virulence in a Caenorhabditis elegans host infection study, for the first time. Our efforts confirm the potential of &#946;&#8208;CDs for the improved delivery of SAHLAs at the host:microbial interface, expanding the utility of this approach as a strategy for probing and controlling QS.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#946; &#8208;Glucosidases are used in the food industry to hydrolyse glycosidic bonds in complex sugars, with enzymes sourced from extremophiles better able to tolerate the process conditions. In this work, a novel &#946;&#8208;glycosidase from the acidophilic organism&#160;  Alicyclobacillus herbarius  &#160;was cloned and heterologously expressed in&#160;  E. coli  &#160;BL21 (DE3).&#160;  Ahe  GH1 was stable over a broad range of pH values (5&#8208;11) and temperatures (4 &#186;C&#8208;55 &#186;C). The enzyme exhibited excellent tolerance to fructose and good tolerance to glucose, retaining 65% activity in the presence of 10% (  w/v  ) glucose. It also tolerated organic solvents, some of which appeared to have a stimulating effect, in particular ethanol with a 1.7&#8208;fold increase in activity at 10% (  v/v  ). The enzyme was then applied for the cleavage of isoflavone from isoflavone glucosides in an ethanolic extract of soy flour, to produce soy isoflavones which constitute a valuable food supplement, achieving full conversion within 15 min at 30 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of a Cyanine&#8208;Bridged Somatostatin Hybrid Probe for Multimodal SSTR2&#8208;Imaging In Vitro and In Vivo</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multimodal imaging probes have attracted the interest of ongoing research, e.g. for surgical removal of tumors. Modular synthesis approaches allow for the construction of hybrid probes consisting of a radiotracer, fluorophore and targeting unit. We present the synthesis of a new asymmetric bifunctional cyanine dye, which can be used as a structural and functional linker for the construction of such hybrid probes. 68 Ga&#8208;DOTATATE, a well&#8208;characterized radiopeptide targeting the overexpressed somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2) in neuroendocrine tumors, was labeled with our cyanine dye, thus providing additional information along with the data obtained from the radiotracer. We tested the SSTR2&#8208;targeting and imaging properties of the resulting probe 68 Ga&#8208;DOTA&#8208;ICC&#8208;TATE in vitro and in a tumor xenograft mouse model. Despite the close proximity between dye and pharmacophore, we observed a high binding affinity towards SSTR2 as well as elevated uptake in SSTR2&#8208;overexpressing tumors in the positron emission tomography (PET) scan and histological examination.</dc:description>

         <title>Advanced understanding of electron transfer pathway of cytochrome P450s</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cytochrome P450s (P450s) are heme&#8208;thiolate enzymes that participate in carbon source assimilation, natural compound biosynthesis and xenobiotics metabolism in all kingdoms of life. P450s can catalyze various reactions using a wide range of organic compounds, thus exhibiting great potentials in biotechnological applications. The catalytic reactions of P450s are driven by electron equivalents that are sourced from pyridine nucleotides and delivered by cognate or matching redox partners (RPs). The electron transfer (ET) route from RPs to P450s involves one or more redox center&#8208;containing domain. As ET rate is one of the main determinants of P450 efficacy, the in&#8208;depth understanding of P450 ET pathway should increase our knowledge of these important enzymes and benefit their further applications. Here, the various P450 RP systems along with current understanding of their ET routes will be reviewed. Notably, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art structural studies of two main types of self&#8208;sufficient P450 will also be summarized.</dc:description>

         <title>An Animal Able To Tolerate D2O</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anhydrobiosis allows two&#8208;step organismal H2O to D2O replacement in the nematode P. superbus, as well as its survival. It is thus the first animal species shown to reproduce in 99.9&#8201;% D2O. In silico structural analyses reveal that its water channel protein is an aquaglyceroporin, whose larger pore might help explain successful organismal influx of D2O.







Abstract
It is possible to gain a deeper insight into the role of water in biology by using physicochemical variant molecules, such as deuterium oxide (D2O); however, D2O is toxic to multicellular organisms in high concentrations. By using a unique desiccation&#8208;rehydration process, we demonstrate that the anhydrobiotic nematode Panagrolaimus superbus is able to tolerate and proliferate in 99&#8201;% D2O. Moreover, we analysed P. superbus&#8217; water&#8208;channel protein (aquaporin; AQP), which is associated with dehydration/rehydration, by comparing its primary structure and modelling its tertiary structure in silico. Our data evidence that P. superbus&#8217; AQP is an aquaglyceroporin, a class of water channel known to display a wider pore; this helps to explain the rapid and successful organismal influx of D2O into this species. This is the first demonstration of an animal able to withstand high D2O levels, thus paving a way for the investigation of the effects D2O on higher levels of biological organization.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anhydrobiosis&lt;/b&gt; allows two&#8208;step organismal H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O replacement in the nematode &lt;i&gt;P. superbus&lt;/i&gt;, as well as its survival. It is thus the first animal species shown to reproduce in 99.9&#8201;% D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. &lt;i&gt;In silico&lt;/i&gt; structural analyses reveal that its water channel protein is an aquaglyceroporin, whose larger pore might help explain successful organismal influx of D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to gain a deeper insight into the role of water in biology by using physicochemical variant molecules, such as deuterium oxide (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O); however, D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is toxic to multicellular organisms in high concentrations. By using a unique desiccation&#8208;rehydration process, we demonstrate that the anhydrobiotic nematode &lt;i&gt;Panagrolaimus superbus&lt;/i&gt; is able to tolerate and proliferate in 99&#8201;% D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Moreover, we analysed &lt;i&gt;P. superbus&#8217;&lt;/i&gt; water&#8208;channel protein (aquaporin; AQP), which is associated with dehydration/rehydration, by comparing its primary structure and modelling its tertiary structure &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt;.

This is the first demonstration of an animal able to withstand high D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O levels, thus paving a way for the investigation of the effects D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O on higher levels of biological organization.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Coniferyl Alcohol Radical Detection by the Dirigent Protein AtDIR6 Monitored by EPR</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stabilization of CA. by DIR has been observed experimentally. Using controlled photo&#8208;irradiation of coniferyl alcohol to generate a CA. and room temperature EPR and HPLC to monitor its fate, we demonstrate that the dirigent protein AtDIR6 stabilizes the formed radical prior to directing the coupling of radicals towards the formation of (&#8722;)&#8208;pinoresinol.







Abstract
Plant dirigent proteins (DIRs) control the stereoselectivity of the monolignol coniferyl alcohol radical coupling. The main mechanistic hypothesis on this chemo&#8208; and stereoselective reaction invokes a binding of coniferyl alcohol radical substrates in the dirigent protein active site so that only one enantiomeric form can be produced. We have studied the influence of the Arabidopsis thaliana AtDIR6 protein on the transient coniferyl alcohol radical by EPR. Herein, we show that AtDIR6 stabilizes coniferyl alcohol radicals prior to directing their coupling towards the formation of (&#8722;)&#8208;pinoresinol.

         <title>RAPTA&#8208;Decorated Polyacrylamide Nanoparticles: Exploring their Synthesis, Physical Properties and Effect on Cell Viability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomedicine: We present a novel nanomedicine consisting of a RAPTA metal&#8208;based drug immobilised onto the surface of polyacrylamide nanoparticles. Our conjugates have been well characterised, and their effects on cell viability evaluated through in&#8197;vitro MTT cytotoxicity assays against HT&#8208;29 colorectal adenocarcinomas. Our conjugate offers a significant 100&#8208;fold increase in performance compared to the RAPTA compound alone.







Abstract
In this study, we report the first successful immobilisation of a known cytoactive [Ru(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(C2O4)PTA] (RAPTA) complex to a biologically inert polyacrylamide nanoparticle support. The nanoparticles have been characterised by zetasizer analysis, UV/Vis, ATR&#8208;FTIR, TGA and ICP&#8208;MS to qualitatively and quantitatively confirm the presence of the metallodrug on the surface of the carrier. The native RAPTA complex required a concentration of 50&#8197;&#956;M to produce a cell viability of 47.1&#177;2.1&#8201;% when incubated with human Caucasian colorectal adenocarcinoma cells for 72&#8197;h. Under similar conditions a cell viability of 45.1&#177;1.9&#8201;% was obtained with 0.5&#8197;&#956;M of RAPTA complex in its immobilised form. Therefore, conjugation of the RAPTA metallodrug to our nanoparticle carriers resulted in a significant 100&#8208;fold decrease in effective concentration of ruthenium required for a near identical biological effect on cell viability.

         <title>Biosynthetic Intermediate Probes for Visualizing and Identifying the Biosynthetic Enzymes of Plant Metabolites</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
See what&#8216;s missing: Biosynthetic study of plant metabolites paves the way for manufacturing plant&#8208;derived drugs by synthetic biology. However, identifying any missing enzymes in a plant metabolic pathway is a formidable challenge. Biosynthetic intermediate probes make potentially useful tools to resolve the challenge by visualizing biosynthetic enzymes to facilitate transcriptome analysis or chemical proteomics approaches for identifying the biosynthetic enzymes.







Abstract
Plant metabolites play important roles in both plant physiology and drug discovery. Taking advantage of new emerging technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS), whole genome assembly, bioinformatics, omics&#8208;based strategies have been demonstrated as popular and powerful ways to elucidate complex metabolic pathways in plants. In this viewpoint, biosynthetic intermediates probes have been proposed as the potentinal tools to study the plant natural product biosynthesis via chemical proteomics appoaches or transcriptome analysis.

         <title>How to quantify a genetic firewall? A polarity based metric for genetic code engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Genetic code engineering aims to produce organisms that translate genetic information in a different way than prescribed by the standard genetic code. This endeavor could eventually lead to a genetic isolation, where an organism that operates under a different genetic code won&#8217;t be able to transfer functional genes with other living species, thereby standing behind a genetic firewall. It is not clear however, how distinct the code should be, nor how to measure the distance. Herein, we developed the metric (&#8710;code), where we assign the amino acids with the polarity indices (  clogD7  ) to calculate the distances between pairs of genetic codes. We then calculated the distance between a set of 204 genetic codes, including the 24 known distinct natural codes, 11 extreme distance codes created computationally, 9 theoretical special purpose codes from literature and 160 codes where canonical amino acids were replaced by non&#8208;canonical chemical analogues. The metric can be used for building strategies towards creation of semantically alienated organisms, testing the strength of genetic firewalls. This metric provides the basis for a map of the genetic codes, which may guide future efforts towards novel biochemical worlds, biosafety and deep barcoding applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Ion Promiscuity and Structure of 2,3&#8208;Dihydroxybenzoic Acid Decarboxylase of Aspergillus oryzae</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On your metal: Elucidation of the unique Mg2+&#8208;dependency of 2,3&#8208;dihydroxybenzoic acid decarboxylase from Aspergillus oryzae, a member of the amidohydroalse superfamily, facilitates a better structure&#8208;activity prediction of the potential biocatalyst, which is capable of catalyzing the regioselective ortho&#8208;(de)carboxylation of phenol derivatives.







Abstract
Broad substrate tolerance and excellent regioselectivity, as well as independence from sensitive cofactors have established benzoic acid decarboxylases from microbial sources as efficient biocatalysts. Robustness under process conditions makes them particularly attractive for preparative&#8208;scale applications. The divalent metal&#8208;dependent enzymes are capable of catalyzing the reversible non&#8208;oxidative (de)carboxylation of a variety of electron&#8208;rich (hetero)aromatic substrates analogously to the chemical Kolbe&#8208;Schmitt reaction. Elemental mass spectrometry supported by crystal structure elucidation and quantum chemical calculations verified the presence of a catalytically relevant Mg2+ complexed in the active site of 2,3&#8208;dihydroxybenoic acid decarboxylase from Aspergillus oryzae (2,3&#8208;DHBD_Ao). This unique example with respect to the nature of the metal is in contrast to mechanistically related decarboxylases, which generally have Zn2+ or Mn2+ as the catalytically active metal.

         <title>Quadruplex&#8208;templated and catalyzed ligation of nucleic acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The template&#8208;guided chemical reactions between the nucleic acid strands is an important process in biomedical research. However, almost all of these reactions employ an&#160;oligonucleotide&#8208;templated approach that is based on double helix alignment. Moderate stability of the double helix makes this approach unsuitable for many chemical reactions.&#160;So, alternative nucleic acid alignment mechanisms, demonstrating higher thermal and chemical stability, are desirable. Earlier,&#160;we have described non&#8208;covalent coupling mechanism between DNA strands via&#160;quadruplex&#8208;and&#8208;Mg2+&#160;connection (QMC). QMC is based on G (guanine)&#8208;quadruplexes and allows unusually stable and specific interactions.&#160;&#160;Herein,&#160;a novel catalytic nucleic acid reaction, based on QMC, is described. This approach utilizes G&#8208;tetrads as a structural and recognition element without employing Watson&#8208;Crick complementarity rules at any stage of substrate/catalyst formation or interaction between them. The quadruplex&#8208;templated ligation can be achieved through self&#8208;ligation of two nucleic acid strands, or through a quadruplex catalyst, which forms a G&#8208;triplex and specifically connects the strands. The process is extraordinarily robust and efficient. For instance, ligation of carbodiimide&#8208;activated substrates can&#160;proceed in boiling solutions and demonstrates a complete ligation within a minute. The quadruplex&#8208;templated and catalyzed reactions will create new opportunities for chemical reactions requiring harsh experimental conditions.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tropane alkaloids (TAs) hyoscyamine and scopolamine function as acetylcholine receptor antagonists and are used clinically as parasympatholytics to treat neuromuscular disorders in humans. While TAs are synthesized in a small subset of plant families, these specialized metabolites are only accumulated in limited quantities in plant organs. The complex chemical structures of these compounds make their industrial production by chemical synthesis very challenging, Therefore, the supply of these TAs still relies on intensive farming of Duboisia shrubs in tropical countries. Many adverse factors such as climate fluctuations and pandemics can thus influence annual world production. Based on the landmark microbial production of the antimalarial semi&#8208;synthetic artemisinin, the Smolke group recently developed a yeast cell factory capable of de novo synthesizing hyoscyamine and scopolamine, thus paving the way for an alternative production of these compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>A FRET&#8208;Based Fluorescent Probe to Screen Anticancer Drugs, Inhibiting p73 Binding to MDM2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trp the light fantastic: FRET&#8208;based detection is described for a protein&#8211;protein interaction between Q18W&#8208;MDM2 and probe p73&#8208;TAD. Adding MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin&#8208;3 to the Q18W&#8208;MDM2/p73&#8208;TAD mixture diminished the FRET signal between the Trp residues of MDM2 and naphthylalanine of p73&#8208;TAD, thereby demonstrating that this system can be used for high&#8208;throughput screening of MDM2 inhibitors.







Abstract
The protein p73 acts as a transcription factor, resulting in tumour suppression. MDM2, an oncogenic protein, can negatively influence p73&#8208;mediated apoptosis by binding to p73 transactivation domains (TAD). Inhibition of the protein&#8208;protein interaction between p73 and oncogenic proteins is an attractive strategy for promoting p73&#8208;mediated apoptosis. Herein, we describe the use of a modified p73&#8208;TAD peptide for the FRET&#8208;based assay of the binding of p73&#8208;TAD to MDM2. The FRET probe, equipped with 1&#8208;naphthylamine (&#955;ex=330&#8197;nm, &#955;em=445&#8197;nm), serves as a FRET acceptor, and the tryptophan of the protein acts as FRET donor (&#955;ex=280&#8197;nm, &#955;em=340&#8197;nm). Sensitized emission from the FRET probe was observed upon excitation of the protein&#8208;FRET&#8208;probe complex at the excitation wavelength of Trp. Furthermore, addition of the MDM2 inhibitor Nutiln&#8208;3 drastically reduced the FRET signal, thus indicating that the FRET probe competes with Nutiln&#8208;3 for MDM2 binding. The developed FRET binding assay might be applicable in high&#8208;throughput screening of novel drugs that inhibit interactions between p73 and MDM2.

         <title>Chemically Diverse Multifunctional Peptide Platforms with Antimicrobial and Cell Adhesive Properties</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Better biomaterials: A multifunctional platform containing a cyclic RGD motif and an antimicrobial peptide, presented using finely tuned spacing units, was found to achieve optimal cell adhesive and bacterial inhibition properties. Anchorage to a biomaterial surface through catechol groups enabled a straightforward functionalization of an implant surface.







Abstract
Bacterial infections and incomplete biomaterial integration are major problems that can lead to the failure of medical implants. However, simultaneously addressing these two issues remains a challenge. Here, we present a chemical peptide library based on a multifunctional platform containing the antimicrobial peptide LF1&#8208;11 and the cell&#8208;adhesive motif RGD. The scaffolds were customized with catechol groups to ensure straightforward functionalization of the implant surface, and linkers of different length to assess the effect of peptide accessibility on the biological response. The peptidic platforms significantly improved the adhesion of mesenchymal stem cells and showed antimicrobial effects against Staphylococcus aureus. Of note is that peptides bearing spacers that were too long displayed the lowest efficiency. Subsequently, we designed a platform replacing linear RGD by cyclic RGD; this further enhanced eukaryotic cell adhesion while retaining excellent antimicrobial properties, thus being a suitable candidate for tissue engineering applications.

         <title>Programmed and Sequential Disassembly of Multi&#8208;responsive Supramolecular Protein Nanoassemblies: A Detailed Mechanistic Investigation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
##: Custom&#8208;designed construction of artificial, multi&#8208;responsive protein nanoassemblies at molecular scale is considered to be of paramount importance. Herein, we report a chemical strategy for the construction of multi&#8208;responsive supramolecular protein nanoassemblies using amphiphilic, monodisperse protein&#8208;dendron based macromolecular synthons.







Abstract
The rational design of a multi&#8208;responsive protein&#8208;based supramolecular system that can predictably respond to more than one stimulus remains an essential but highly challenging goal in biomolecular engineering. Herein, we report a novel chemical method for the construction of multi&#8208;responsive supramolecular nanoassemblies using custom&#8208;designed facially amphiphilic monodisperse protein&#8208;dendron bioconjugates. The macromolecular synthons contain a globular hydrophilic protein domain site&#8208;specifically conjugated to photo&#8208;responsive hydrophobic benzyl&#8208;ether dendrons of different generations through oligo(ethylene glycol) linkers of defined length. The size of the protein nanoassemblies can be systematically tuned by choosing an appropriate dendron or linker of defined length. Exposure of protein nanoassemblies to light results in partial rather than complete disassembly of the complex. The newly formed protein nanoparticle no longer responds to light but could be disassembled into constitutive monomers under acidic conditions or by further treatment with a small molecule. More interestingly, the distribution ratio of the assembled versus disassembled states of protein nanoassemblies after photochemical reaction does not depend on dendron generation, the nature of the linker functionality or the identity of the protein, but is heavily influenced by the linker length. In sum, this work discloses a new chemical method for the rational design of a monodisperse multi&#8208;responsive protein&#8208;based supramolecular system with exquisite control over the disassembly process.

         <title>Structural Insights into the Interaction of Heme with Protein Tyrosine Kinase JAK2**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Where it&#8242;s happening: JAK2 is of paramount importance in erythropoietic precursor cells and its dysfunction drives myeloid cancers. Heme is accumulated by these cells in order to produce hemoglobin. Here we show that heme can drive JAK2 phosphorylation in K562 myeloid tumor cells. We identify two possible interaction sites based on distinct heme&#8208;binding motifs, that is, cysteine&#8208;proline and histidine&#8208;X&#8208;tyrosine. Structural insights into the interaction of heme with protein tyrosine kinase JAK2 (Imhof @UniBonn)







Abstract
Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) is the most important signal&#8208;transducing tyrosine kinase in erythropoietic precursor cells. Its malfunction drives several myeloproliferative disorders. Heme is a small metal&#8208;ion&#8208;carrying molecule that is incorporated into hemoglobin in erythroid precursor cells to transport oxygen. In addition, heme is a signaling molecule and regulator of various biochemical processes. Here, we show that heme exposure leads to hyperphosphorylation of JAK2 in a myeloid cancer cell line. Two peptides identified in JAK2 are heme&#8208;regulatory motifs and show low&#8208;micromolar affinities for heme. These peptides map to the kinase domain of JAK2, which is essential for downstream signaling. We suggest these motifs to be the interaction sites of heme with JAK2, which drive the heme&#8208;induced hyperphosphorylation. The results presented herein could facilitate the development of heme&#8208;related pharmacological tools to combat myeloproliferative disorders.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where it&#8242;s happening&lt;/b&gt;: JAK2 is of paramount importance in erythropoietic precursor cells and its dysfunction drives myeloid cancers. Heme is accumulated by these cells in order to produce hemoglobin. Here we show that heme can drive JAK2 phosphorylation in K562 myeloid tumor cells. We identify two possible interaction sites based on distinct heme&#8208;binding motifs, that is, cysteine&#8208;proline and histidine&#8208;X&#8208;tyrosine.

         <title>Magnetic Resonance Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange of Selective PyFALGEA Oligopeptide Ligands Towards Epidermal Growth Factor Receptors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SABRE hyperpolarization of complex molecules with crucial biological activity: The PyFALGEA oligopeptide is a highly selective ligand towards the tyrosine kinase epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Here, the SABRE hyperpolarization of the PyFALGEA molecule was demonstrated. This research indicated that SABRE can be employed to enhance the NMR signals of very complex biorelevant molecules.







Abstract
The biorelevant PyFALGEA oligopeptide ligand, which is selective towards the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), has been successfully employed as a substrate in magnetic resonance signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) experiments. It is demonstrated that PyFALGEA and the iridium catalyst IMes form a PyFALGEA:IMes molecular complex. The interaction between PyFALGEA:IMes and H2 results in a ternary SABRE complex. Selective 1D EXSY experiments reveal that this complex is labile, which is an essential condition for successful hyperpolarization by SABRE. Polarization transfer from parahydrogen to PyFALGEA is observed leading to significant enhancement of the 1H NMR signals of PyFALGEA. Different iridium catalysts and peptides are inspected to discuss the influence of their molecular structures on the efficiency of hyperpolarization. It is observed that PyFALGEA oligopeptide hyperpolarization is more efficient when an iridium catalyst with a sterically less demanding NHC ligand system such as IMesBn is employed. Experiments with shorter analogues of PyFALGEA, that is, PyLGEA and PyEA, show that the bulky phenylalanine from the PyFALGEA oligopeptide causes steric hindrance in the SABRE complex, which hampers hyperpolarization with IMes. Finally, a single&#8208;scan 1H NMR SABRE experiment of PyFALGEA with IMesBn revealed a unique pattern of NMR lines in the hydride region, which can be treated as a fingerprint of this important oligopeptide.

         <title>Why Does the Novel Coronavirus Spike Protein Interact so Strongly with the Human ACE2? A Thermodynamic Answer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The receptor binding domain (RBD) from coronavirus&#8217; spike protein recognizes human angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), making it an important drug target. This in silico study compares RBD interactions from SARS&#8208;CoV and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with the hACE2, revealing an intricate pattern of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, and a free energy of binding consistently stronger for the later virus.







Abstract
The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 pandemic is the biggest health concern today, but until now there is no treatment. One possible drug target is the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the coronavirus&#8217; spike protein, which recognizes the human angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). Our in silico study discusses crucial structural and thermodynamic aspects of the interactions involving RBDs from the SARS&#8208;CoV and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with the hACE2. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations explain why the chemical affinity of the new SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 for hACE2 is much higher than in the case of SARS&#8208;CoV, revealing an intricate pattern of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions and estimating a free energy of binding, which is consistently much more negative in the case of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. This work presents a chemical reason for the difficulty in treating the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus with drugs targeting its spike protein and helps to explain its infectiousness.

         <title>Hybridization Networks of mRNA and Branched RNA Hybrids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Branched oligoribonucleotide hybrids that hybridize to two different loci of mRNA were used to produce a biomaterial that may become useful for vaccination.







Abstract
Messenger RNA (mRNA) is emerging as an attractive biopolymer for therapy and vaccination. To become suitable for vaccination, mRNA is usually converted to a biomaterial, using cationic peptides, polymers or lipids. An alternative form of converting mRNA into a material is demonstrated that uses branched oligoribonucleotide hybrids with the ability to hybridize with one or more regions of the mRNA sequence. Two such hybrids with hexamer arms and adamantane tetraol as branching element were prepared by solution&#8208;phase synthesis. When a rabies mRNA was treated with the branched hybrids at 1&#8197;M NaCl concentration, biomaterials formed that contained both of the nucleic acids. These results show that branched oligoribonucleotides are an alternative to the often toxic reagents commonly used to formulate mRNA for medical applications.

         <dc:description>
Control of the T7 promoter system: TALE selectively suppresses protein expression through target&#8208;site&#8208;specific DNA recognition and DNA binding. As competitive inhibition of TALE binding restored protein synthesis levels, our results show that TALE can regulate the expression of the T7 promoter system by DNA recognition.







Abstract
The aim of this study was to develop a transcription activator&#8208;like effector (TALE)&#8208;based technology to regulate protein synthesis in cell&#8208;free systems. We attempted to regulate the T7 promoter system, which has no natural mechanism of expression control, and sought to arbitrarily induce protein expression through the formation and dissociation of TALE and target DNA complexes. Protein synthesis was performed in a cell&#8208;free system in the presence of TALE, which recognized and bound to a sequence upstream of the T7 promoter, and protein expression was suppressed by approximately 80&#8201;% compared to in the absence of TALE. This suggests that masking part of the promoter region strongly suppresses protein synthesis. Additionally, competitive inhibition of TALE binding to the target DNA template led to protein synthesis levels that were equivalent to the levels in the absence of TALE. Our results demonstrate that DNA recognition by TALE can regulate the expression of the T7 promoter system.

         <title>Chemical Translational Biology: Redefining Druggability of Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein&#8208;protein interactions are challenging targets for drug discovery. The field of chemical translational biology has made advances in making these once &#8220;undruggable&#8221; targets more amenable to ligand discovery and design. The development of peptide therapeutics and the discovery of adaptive and allosteric ligands show particular promise for difficult interactions.







Abstract
Chemical biologists use chemical tools to answer biological questions. The translational application of these principles has led to an explosion in the discovery and druggability of new protein targets, including protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs). Proteins tend to interact with other macromolecules using relatively large and featureless binding surfaces, which has hampered traditional drug discovery efforts, particularly for interactions with weaker affinity. In this article, I discuss several emerging strategies for targeting PPIs, including computational and structural methods and novel screening approaches. In particular, I focus on hijacking intrinsic protein allosteric pathways for the discovery and design of small&#8208;molecule and peptide ligands.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Antibody Fragment Conjugates for Reversible Staining in Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antibody conjugates have taken a great leap forward as tools in basic and applied molecular life sciences, which was enabled by the development of chemoselective reactions for the site&#8208;specific modification of proteins. Antibody&#8208;oligonucleotide conjugates combine the antibody&#8217;s target specificity with the reversible, sequence&#8208;encoded binding properties of oligonucleotides like DNAs or PNAs, allowing sequential imaging of large numbers of targets in a single specimen. In this report, we use the Tub&#8208;tag  &#9415;  technology in combination with Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne&#8208;cycloaddition for the site&#8208;specific conjugation of single DNA and PNA strands to an eGFP&#8208;binding nanobody. We show binding of the conjugate to recombinant eGFP and subsequent sequence&#8208;specific annealing of fluorescently labelled imager strands. Furthermore, we reversibly stain eGFP&#8208;tagged proteins in human cells, thus demonstrating the suitability of our conjugation strategy to generate antibody&#8208;oligonucleotides for reversible immunofluorescence imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery and Engineering of a Novel Baeyer&#8211;Villiger Monooxygenase from Gordonia sihwensis with High Normal Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Baeyer&#8211;Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) are remarkable biocatalysts for the Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation of ketones to generate esters or lactones. The regioselectivity of BVMOs is essential for determining the ratio of the two regioisomeric products (&#8220;normal&#8221; and &#8220;abnormal&#8221;) when catalyzing asymmetric ketone substrates. Starting from a known normal&#8208;preferring BVMO sequence from  Pseudomonas putida  KT2440 (  Pp  BVMO), a novel BVMO from  Gordonia sihwensis  (  Gs  BVMO) with higher normal regioselectivity (up to 97/3) was identified. Furthermore, protein engineering increased the specificity constant (  k  cat  /  K  M  ) 8.9&#8208;fold to 484 s  &#8208;1  mM  &#8208;1  for 10&#8208;ketostearic acid derived from oleic acid. Consequently, by using the variant  Gs  BVMO  C308L  as an efficient biocatalyst, 10&#8208;ketostearic acid was efficiently transformed into &#160;9&#8208;(nonanoyloxy)nonanoic acid, with a space&#8208;time yield of 60.5 g L  &#8208;1  d  &#8208;1  . This study showed that the mutant with higher regioselectivity and catalytic efficiency could be applied to prepare medium&#8208;chain &#969;&#8208;hydroxy fatty acids through biotransformation of long&#8208;chain aliphatic keto acids derived from renewable plant oils.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Sulfide Oxidation by Sulfide Quinone Oxidoreductase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regulating sulfide toxicity and signaling: Utilizing an active&#8208;site cysteine trisulfide, human sulfide quinone oxidoreductase detoxifies hydrogen sulfide, a respiratory poison. Herein, we detail the remarkable enzymology of sulfide quinone oxidoreductase and its potential modulation of sulfide signaling.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an environmental toxin and a heritage of ancient microbial metabolism that has stimulated new interest following its discovery as a neuromodulator. While many physiological responses have been attributed to low H2S levels, higher levels inhibit complex IV in the electron transport chain. To prevent respiratory poisoning, a dedicated set of enzymes that make up the mitochondrial sulfide oxidation pathway exists to clear H2S. The committed step in this pathway is catalyzed by sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR), which couples sulfide oxidation to coenzyme Q10 reduction in the electron transport chain. The SQOR reaction prevents H2S accumulation and generates highly reactive persulfide species as products; these can be further oxidized or can modify cysteine residues in proteins by persulfidation. Here, we review the kinetic and structural characteristics of human SQOR, and how its unconventional redox cofactor configuration and substrate promiscuity lead to sulfide clearance and potentially expand the signaling potential of H2S. This dual role of SQOR makes it a promising target for H2S&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Activity&#8208;Based Protein Profiling of Chitin Catabolism</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trying to fit in chitin: To understand microbial chitinase function, we synthesized activity&#8208;based probes by modifying the chitin derivatives chitotriose and N&#8208;acetylglucosamine. The probes were used to profile the functional response of Cellvibrio japonicus to culture on chitin and non&#8208;chitin substrates. Fluorescence gels and proteomics were used to characterize probe labeling.







Abstract
The microbial catabolism of chitin, an abundant and ubiquitous environmental organic polymer, is a fundamental cog in terrestrial and aquatic carbon and nitrogen cycles. Despite the importance of this critical bio&#8208;geochemical function, there is a limited understanding of the synergy between the various hydrolytic and accessory enzymes involved in chitin catabolism. To address this deficit, we synthesized activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs) designed to target active chitinolytic enzymes by modifying the chitin subunits N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine and chitotriose. The ABPs were used to determine the active complement of chitinolytic enzymes produced over time by the soil bacterium Cellvibrio japonicus treated with various C substrates. We demonstrate the utility of these ABPs in determining the synergy between various enzymes involved in chitin catabolism. The strategy can be used to gain molecular&#8208;level insights that can be used to better understand microbial roles in soil bio&#8208;geochemical cycling in the face of a changing climate.

         <title>Regulating CRISPR/Cas9 Function through Conditional Guide RNA Control</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different strategies have been developed to control guide RNA function in the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Both external and cellular triggers, including light, small molecules, proteins, and oligonucleotides, were used for convenient and precise regulation of genome editing and transcriptional activation in cells. These methods provide spatial and temporal resolution for gene editing and might find future therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Conditional control of CRISPR/Cas9 has been developed by using a variety of different approaches, many focusing on manipulation of the Cas9 protein itself. However, more recent strategies for governing CRISPR/Cas9 function are based on guide RNA (gRNA) modifications. They include control of gRNAs by light, small molecules, proteins, and oligonucleotides. These designs have unique advantages compared to other approaches and have allowed precise regulation of gene editing and transcription. Here, we discuss strategies for conditional control of gRNA function and compare effectiveness of these methods.

         <title>Machine Learning Enables Selection of Epistatic Enzyme Mutants for Stability Against Unfolding and Detrimental Aggregation</title>

A quick learner: Machine learning based on the innov'SAR algorithm leads to efficient selection of highly robust limonene epoxide hydrolase mutants with enhanced unfolding stability and resistance to aggregation by recognizing epistatic mutational interactions.







Abstract
Machine learning (ML) has pervaded most areas of protein engineering, including stability and stereoselectivity. Using limonene epoxide hydrolase as the model enzyme and innov'SAR as the ML platform, comprising a digital signal process, we achieved high protein robustness that can resist unfolding with concomitant detrimental aggregation. Fourier transform (FT) allows us to take into account the order of the protein sequence and the nonlinear interactions between positions, and thus to grasp epistatic phenomena. The innov'SAR approach is interpolative, extrapolative and makes outside&#8208;the&#8208;box, predictions not found in other state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ML or deep learning approaches. Equally significant is the finding that our approach to ML in the present context, flanked by advanced molecular dynamics simulations, uncovers the connection between epistatic mutational interactions and protein robustness.

         <title>Towards Dissecting the Mechanism of Protein Phosphatase&#8208;1 Inhibition by Its C&#8208;Terminal Phosphorylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interrogating a mechanistic black box: Phosphoprotein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is among the major serine/threonine phosphatases and is involved in numerous pathways. Autoinhibition by phosphorylation of Thr320 at the C&#8208;terminus leads to cell&#8208;cycle arrest and neuronal defects. However, the mechanism underlying this regulatory phosphorylation site is unknown. Herein, we investigate potential mechanisms.







Abstract
Phosphoprotein phosphatase&#8208;1 (PP1) is a key player in the regulation of phospho&#8208;serine (pSer) and phospho&#8208;threonine (pThr) dephosphorylation and is involved in a large fraction of cellular signaling pathways. Aberrant activity of PP1 has been linked to many diseases, including cancer and heart failure. Besides a well&#8208;established activity control by regulatory proteins, an inhibitory function for phosphorylation (p) of a Thr residue in the C&#8208;terminal intrinsically disordered tail of PP1 has been demonstrated. The associated phenotype of cell&#8208;cycle arrest was repeatedly proposed to be due to autoinhibition of PP1 through either conformational changes or substrate competition. Here, we use PP1 variants created by mutations and protein semisynthesis to differentiate between these hypotheses. Our data support the hypothesis that pThr exerts its inhibitory function by mediating protein complex formation rather than by a direct mechanism of structural changes or substrate competition.

         <title>Cysteine&#8208;Rich Peptides: Hyperstable Scaffolds for Protein Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Better in the loop: Cysteine&#8208;rich peptides possess hyperstability against high temperatures, salt concentration, serum presence, and proteolytic degradation. These peptides have been successfully used as stable scaffolds for molecular grafting, a protein engineering process in which cysteine&#8208;rich structures enclave an exogenous and bioactive epitope that provides higher thermodynamic and metabolic stability to the epitope and new functionality to the scaffold.







Abstract
Cysteine&#8208;rich peptides (CRPs) are small proteins of less than 100 amino acids in length characterized by the presence of disulfide bridges and common end&#8208;to&#8208;end macrocyclization. These properties confer hyperstability against high temperatures, salt concentration, serum presence, and protease degradation to CRPs. Moreover, their intercysteine domains (loops) are susceptible to residue hypervariability. CRPs have been successfully applied as stable scaffolds for molecular grafting, a protein engineering process in which cysteine&#8208;rich structures provide higher thermodynamic and metabolic stability to an epitope and acquire new biological function(s). This review describes the successes and limitations of seven cysteine&#8208;rich scaffolds, their bioactive epitopes, and the resulting grafted peptides.

         <title>Structure of the O&#8208;antigen and the lipid A from the lipopolysaccharide of Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 51191</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fusobacterium nucleatum  is a common member of the oral microbiota. However, this symbiont has been found to play an active role in disease development. As a Gram&#8208;negative bacterium,  F. nucleatum  has a protective outer membrane layer whose external leaflet is mainly composed by lipopolysaccharides (LPSs). LPS plays a crucial role in the interaction between bacteria and the host immune system.

         <title>The effects of 5&#8208;OP&#8208;RU stereochemistry on its stability and MAIT&#8208;MR1 axis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Location, location, location: All the stereoisomers of 5&#8208;OP&#8208;RU were synthesized to elucidate the effects of its stereochemistry on MR1&#8208;dependent MAIT cell activation. Of the stereoisomers, only the 4&#8217;&#8208;OH epimer demonstrated potent MAIT cell activity, thus indicating that the configuration of the 2&#8217;&#8208;OH and 3&#8217;&#8208;OH group could be important for agonistic activity.







Abstract
Mucosal&#8208;associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are an abundant subset of innate&#8208;like T lymphocytes. MAIT cells are activated by microbial riboflavin&#8208;derived antigens, such as 5&#8208;(2&#8208;oxopropylideneamino)&#8208;6&#8208;d&#8208;ribitylaminouracil (5&#8208;OP&#8208;RU), when presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I&#8208;related protein (MR1). We have synthesized all stereoisomers of 5&#8208;OP&#8208;RU to investigate the effects of its stereochemistry on the MR1&#8208;dependent MAIT cell activation and MR1 upregulation. The analysis of MAIT cell activation by these 5&#8208;OP&#8208;RU isomers revealed that the stereocenters at the 2&#8217;&#8208; and 3&#8217;&#8208;OH groups in the ribityl tail are crucial for the recognition of MAIT&#8208;TCR, whereas that of 4&#8217;&#8208;OH group does not significantly affect the regulation of MAIT cell activity. Furthermore, kinetic analysis of complex formation between the ligands and MR1 suggested that 5&#8208;OP&#8208;RU forms a covalent bond to MR1 in cells within 1&#8197;hour. These findings provide guidelines for designing ligands that regulate MAIT cell functions.

Paralytic analgesics? A polyketide synthase&#8208;like enzyme from the saxitoxin biosynthesis pathway of R. raciborskii was heterologously expressed in E. coli. SxtA had relaxed substrate activity giving rise to 4&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;guanidinoheptane (ethyl ketone) and methyl ketone. Manipulating the growth medium gave different ratios of the intermediates. The promiscuity of SxtA could lead to saxitoxin variants and other compounds of biomedical value.







Abstract
Paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) are neurotoxic alkaloids produced by freshwater cyanobacteria and marine dinoflagellates. Due to their antagonism of voltage&#8208;gated sodium channels in excitable cells, certain analogues are of significant pharmacological interest. The biosynthesis of the parent compound, saxitoxin, is initiated with the formation of 4&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;guanidinoheptane (ethyl ketone) by an unusual polyketide synthase&#8208;like enzyme, SxtA. We have heterologously expressed SxtA from Raphidiopsis raciborskii T3 in Escherichia coli and analysed its activity in&#8197;vivo. Ethyl ketone and a truncated analogue, methyl ketone, were detected by HPLC&#8208;ESI&#8208;HRMS analysis, thus suggesting that SxtA has relaxed substrate specificity in&#8197;vivo. The chemical structures of these products were further verified by tandem mass spectrometry and labelled&#8208;precursor feeding with [guanidino&#8208;15N2] arginine and [1,2&#8208;13C2] acetate. These results indicate that the reactions catalysed by SxtA could give rise to multiple PST variants, including analogues of ecological and pharmacological significance.

         <title>Binding of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 to Cell Receptors: A Tale of Molecular Evolution</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All together, now: Explicit virus cell interactions are seen between the spike protein and the proteins in the host cell. The collective action of a multitude of weak interactions stabilizes the initial virus cell contact. SARS&#8208;COV to SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 mutations are driven by an evolution pressure that leads to enhanced hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
The magnified infectious power of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus compared to its precursor SARS&#8208;CoV is intimately linked to an enhanced ability in the mutated virus to find available hydrogen&#8208;bond sites in the host cells. This characteristic is acquired during virus evolution because of the selective pressure exerted at the molecular level. We pinpoint the specific residue (in the virus) to residue (in the cell) contacts during the initial recognition and binding and show that the virus&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;cell interaction is mainly due to an extensive network of hydrogen bonds and to a large surface of noncovalent interactions. In addition to the formal quantum characterization of bonding interactions, computation of absorption spectra for the specific virus&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;cell interacting residues yields significant shifts of &#916;&#955;max=47 and 66&#8197;nm in the wavelength for maximum absorption in the complex with respect to the isolated host and virus, respectively.

         <title>Comparison of Bioorthogonal &#946;&#8208;Lactone Activity&#8208;Based Probes for Selective Labeling of Penicillin&#8208;Binding Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isoform&#8208;specific targeting: The synthesis and comparison of selective, bioorthogonal, activity&#8208;based probes for penicillin&#8208;binding proteins (PBPs) is reported. We demonstrate the expanded functional utility of bioorthogonal probes compared to fluorescent analogues and explore design considerations for the development of bioorthogonal probes that are applicable beyond the probes described in this work.







Abstract
Penicillin&#8208;binding proteins (PBPs) are a family of bacterial enzymes that are key components of cell&#8208;wall biosynthesis and the target of &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics. Most microbial pathogens contain multiple structurally homologous PBP isoforms, making it difficult to target individual PBPs. To study the roles and regulation of specific PBP isoforms, a panel of bioorthogonal &#946;&#8208;lactone probes was synthesized and compared. Fluorescent labeling confirmed selectivity, and PBPs were selectively enriched from Streptococcus pneumoniae lysates. Comparisons between fluorescent labeling of probes revealed that the accessibility of bioorthogonal reporter molecules to the bound probe in the native protein environment exerts a more significant effect on labeling intensity than the bioorthogonal reaction used, observations that are likely applicable beyond this class of probes or proteins. Selective, bioorthogonal activity&#8208;based probes for PBPs will facilitate the activity&#8208;based determination of the roles and regulation of specific PBP isoforms, a key gap in knowledge that has yet to be filled.

         <title>Characterization of Apo&#8208;Form Selective Inhibition of Indoleamine 2,3&#8208;Dioxygenase**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Inhibiting IDO1: IDO1 is a heme&#8208;containing tryptophan metabolizing enzyme, and identified as antitumor target. Many groups have achieved effective IDO1 inhibition. This study defines two distinct molecular mechanisms of inhibiting apo and holo forms of IDO1. The approach can serve as an example for enzyme form selective drug screening and design.&#160;







Abstract
Indoleamine&#8208;2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a heme&#8208;containing enzyme that catalyzes the rate&#8208;limiting step in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan (TRP) metabolism. As it is an inflammation&#8208;induced immunoregulatory enzyme, pharmacological inhibition of IDO1 activity is currently being pursued as a potential therapeutic tool for the treatment of cancer and other disease states. As such, a detailed understanding of the mechanism of action of IDO1 inhibitors with various mechanisms of inhibition is of great interest. Comparison of an apo&#8208;form&#8208;binding IDO1 inhibitor (GSK5628) to the heme&#8208;coordinating compound, epacadostat (Incyte), allows us to explore the details of the apo&#8208;binding inhibition of IDO1. Herein, we demonstrate that GSK5628 inhibits IDO1 by competing with heme for binding to a heme&#8208;free conformation of the enzyme (apo&#8208;IDO1), whereas epacadostat coordinates its binding with the iron atom of the IDO1 heme cofactor. Comparison of these two compounds in cellular systems reveals a long&#8208;lasting inhibitory effect of GSK5628, previously undescribed for other known IDO1 inhibitors. Detailed characterization of this apo&#8208;binding mechanism for IDO1 inhibition might help design superior inhibitors or could confer a unique competitive advantage over other IDO1 inhibitors vis&#8208;&#224;&#8208;vis specificity and pharmacokinetic parameters.

         <title>Courses Based on iGEM/BIOMOD Competitions Are the Ideal Format for Research&#8208;Based Learning of Xenobiology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Competition experiments: &#8220;iGEM&#8208;Synthetic Biology&#8221; is a student&#8208;centered, research&#8208;based teaching format for xenobiology. Students conduct their own experiments in an interdisciplinary team with a focus on participation in an international competition. Such formats motivate students to show the highest performance and are possibly the best way to teach novel emerging research fields within the Humboldtian model of higher education.







Abstract
Synthetic biology and especially xenobiology, as emerging new fields of science, have reached an intellectual and experimental maturity that makes them suitable for integration into the university curricula of chemical and biological disciplines. Novel scientific fields that include laboratory work are perfect playgrounds for developing highly motivating research&#8208;based teaching modules. We believe that research&#8208;based learning enriched by digital tools is the best approach for teaching new emerging essentials of academic education. This is especially true when the scientific field as such is still not canonized with text books and best&#8208;practice examples. Our experience shows that iGEM/BIOMOD competitions represent an excellent basis for designing research&#8208;based courses in xenobiology. Therefore, we present a report on &#8220;iGEM&#8211;Synthetic Biology&#8221; offered at the Technische Universit&#228;t Berlin as an example.

         <title>Stabilizing AqdC, a Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal&#8208;Cleaving Dioxygenase from Mycobacteria, by FRESCO&#8208;Based Protein Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Swings and roundabouts: The dioxygenase AqdC, an &#945;/&#946;&#8208;hydrolase fold protein, inactivates a virulence&#8208;associated signal molecule of the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using computational approaches to predict and engineer thermostable AqdC variants, we found that gains in thermostability (up to +11.8&#8201;&#176;C) were traded against losses in activity, likely due to difficulties in opening the entrance to the active site.







Abstract
The mycobacterial PQS dioxygenase AqdC, a cofactor&#8208;less protein with an &#945;/&#946;&#8208;hydrolase fold, inactivates the virulence&#8208;associated quorum&#8208;sensing signal molecule 2&#8208;heptyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;quinolone (PQS) produced by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and is therefore a potential anti&#8208;virulence tool. We have used computational library design to predict stabilizing amino acid replacements in AqdC. While 57 out of 91 tested single substitutions throughout the protein led to stabilization, as judged by increases in 
 of &gt;2&#8201;&#176;C, they all impaired catalytic activity. Combining substitutions, the proteins AqdC&#8208;G40K&#8208;A134L&#8208;G220D&#8208;Y238W and AqdC&#8208;G40K&#8208;G220D&#8208;Y238W showed extended half&#8208;lives and the best trade&#8208;off between stability and activity, with increases in 
 of 11.8 and 6.1&#8201;&#176;C and relative activities of 22 and 72&#8201;%, respectively, compared to AqdC. Molecular dynamics simulations and principal component analysis suggested that stabilized proteins are less flexible than AqdC, and the loss of catalytic activity likely correlates with an inability to effectively open the entrance to the active site.

         <title>Site Directed Mutagenesis of Modular Polyketide Synthase Ketoreductase Domains for Altered Stereochemical Control</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial modular type I polyketide synthases (PKSs) are complex multidomain assembly line proteins that produce a range of pharmaceutically relevant molecules with a high degree of stereochemical control. Due to their colinear properties, they have been considerable targets for rational biosynthetic pathway engineering.&#160; Among the domains harbored within these complex assembly lines, ketoreductase (KR) domains have been extensively studied with the goal of altering their stereoselectivity via site directed mutagenesis, as they confer much of the stereochemical complexity present in pharmaceutically active reduced polyketide scaffolds.&#160; Here we review all efforts to date to perform site directed mutagenesis on PKS KRs, most of which have been done in the context of excised KR domains on model diffusible substrates such as &#946;&#8208;keto N&#8208;acetyl cysteamine thioesters.&#160; We also discuss the challenges around translating the findings of these studies to alter stereocontrol in the context of a complex multidomain enzymatic assembly line.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering the Next Generation of Matched Models for Chemical Translational Biology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Matched models: The translation of drug compounds from high&#8208;throughput models to high&#8208;order, low&#8208;throughput biological models is a major obstacle facing chemical biology. I present here a case for considering the next generation of matched biological models to address this bottleneck.







Abstract
In order to achieve patient personalization and translate compounds through the discovery phase into the clinic, high throughput test models should be designed to be as closely matched to the patient as possible. Engineering high throughput and physiologically relevant biological models is the idealized scenario for testing next generation modulators. I present here a cautionary example of a misaligned model as well as my viewpoint on how overcoming this bottleneck is one of the next frontiers in chemical biology.

         <title>Metabolic Glycoengineering with Azide&#8208; and Alkene&#8208;Modified Hexosamines: Quantification of Sialic Acid Levels</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metabolic glycoengineering (MGE) is an established method to incorporate chemical reporter groups into cellular glycans for subsequent bioorthogonal labeling. The method has found broad application for the visualization and isolation of glycans allowing to probe their biological roles. Furthermore, targeting of drugs to cancer cells, that present high concentrations of sialic acids on their surface, is an attractive approach. We report the application of a labeling reaction using 1,2&#8208;diamino&#8208;4,5&#8208;methylenedioxybenzene for the quantification of sialic acid derivates after MGE with various azide&#8208; and alkene&#8208;modified ManNAc, GlcNAc, and GalNAc derivatives. We followed the time course of sialic acid production and were able to detect sialic acids modified with the chemical reporter group not only after addition of ManNAc derivatives to the cell culture. A cyclopropane&#8208;modified ManNAc derivative, being a model for the corresponding cyclopropene analog that undergoes fast inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder reactions with 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazines, resulted in the highest incorporation efficiency. Furthermore, we investigated whether feeding of the cells with natural and unnatural ManNAc derivative results in increased levels of sialic acids and found that this is strongly dependent on the investigated cell type and cell fraction. For HEK 293T cells, a strong increase of free sialic acids in the cell interior was found whereas cell&#8208;surface sialic acid levels are only moderately increased.</dc:description>

         <title>Simplified monopalmitoyl Toll&#8208;like receptor 2 ligand mini&#8208;UPam for self&#8208;adjuvanting neoantigen&#8208;based synthetic cancer vaccines</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic vaccines from antigenic peptides that comprise MHC&#8208;I and MHC&#8208;II T&#8208;cell epitopes expressed by tumors, show great promise for cancer immunotherapy. For optimal immunogenicity, the synthetic peptides (SPs) should be adjuvanted with suitable immunostimulatory additives. Previously, we have shown that improved immunogenicity  in vivo  is obtained with vaccine modalities in which an SP is covalently connected to an adjuvanting moiety, typically a ligand to Toll&#8208;like receptor 2 (TLR2). The SPs were covalently attached to UPam, a derivative of the classic TLR2 ligand Pam3CysSK4. A disadvantage of the triply palmitoylated UPam is its high lipophilicity that precludes a universal adoption of this adjuvant for covalent modification of variable antigenic peptides rendering the synthetic vaccine insoluble in several cases. Here, we report a novel conjugatable TLR2 ligand, mini&#8208;UPam, containing only one instead of three palmitoyl chains with less impact on the solubility and other physicochemical properties of the conjugate. In this study, we used SPs containing the clinically relevant neoepitopes identified in a melanoma patient who obtained a complete response after T&#8208;cell therapy. Homogeneous mini&#8208;UPam&#8208;SP conjugates have been prepared in good yields by solid&#8208;phase synthesis using mini&#8208;UPam building block prepared in solution and a standard set of Fmoc&#8208;amino acids. The immunogenicity of the novel mini&#8208;UPam&#8208;SP conjugates was demonstrated using the cancer patient&#8217;s T&#8208;cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Superior Proton Transfer Catalytic Promiscuity of Cytochrome C in Self&#8208;organized Media</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Evolutionarily elderly proteins commonly feature greater catalytic promiscuity. Cytochrome c (cyt c) is one among first set of proteins in evolution with known prospects in electron transport and peroxidative property. Here we report that cyt c is a proficient proton transfer catalyst too and enhances the Kemp elimination (KE) (model reaction to show proton transfer catalytic property) by ~750 fold on self&#8208;organized systems like&#8208; micelles and vesicles. The self&#8208;organized systems mimic the mitochondrial environment in&#8208;vitro for cyt c. Using an array of biophysical and biochemical mutational assays, mechanistic pathways involving both acid/base and redox have been explored. The histidine (His&#8208;18) moiety close to hemin group is mainly responsible for proton abstraction to promote the concerted E2 pathway for KE catalysis when cyt c is in oxidized form which has also been confirmed by a H18A mutant version of cyt c. However, redox pathway is more predominant under reducing condition in presence of dithiothreitol (DTT) at pH range 6 to 7.4. Interestingly, we have found an almost 750&#8208;fold enhanced KE catalysis by cyt c compared to aqueous buffer. Overall, the presented data apart from providing mechanistic insights, it reveals an unprecedented catalytic property of cyt c which can be of high importance in evolutionary perspective considering its role in delineating phylogenic tree and also towards generating programmable designer biocatalyst.</dc:description>

Overall, the presented data apart from providing mechanistic insights, it reveals an unprecedented catalytic property of cyt c which can be of high importance in evolutionary perspective considering its role in delineating phylogenic tree and also towards generating programmable designer biocatalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Methylene&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Lactone Scaffold for Developing Chemical Probes at the Two Ends of the Selectivity Spectrum</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Create high&#8208;coverage and selective probes from multi&#8208;reactive scaffold: An &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactone (MeLac) scaffold provides new paths to create reactivity&#8208; and proximity&#8208;driven covalent probes for chemical proteomics. Multiple reactivities of the MeLac warhead allows it to react with different protein nucleophiles through distinct mechanisms, and to assemble highly selective proteomics probes. MeLac&#8208;derived probes have potential to make significant impacts on drug discovery and development.







Abstract
The utilities of an &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactone (MeLac) moiety as a warhead composed of multiple electrophilic sites are reported. We demonstrate that a MeLac&#8208;alkyne not only reacts with diverse proteins as a broadly reactive measurement probe, but also recruits reduced endogenous glutathione (GSH) to assemble a selective chemical probe of GSH&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactone (GSH&#8208;Lac)&#8208;alkyne in live cells. Tandem mass spectrometry reveals that MeLac reacts with nucleophilic cysteine, serine, lysine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, through either Michael or acyl addition. A peptide&#8208;centric proteomics platform demonstrates that the proteomic selectivity profiles of orlistat and parthenolide, which have distinct reactivities, are measurable by MeLac&#8208;alkyne as a high&#8208;coverage probe. The GSH&#8208;Lac&#8208;alkyne selectively probes the glutathione S&#8208;transferase P responsible for multidrug resistance. The assembly of the GSH&#8208;Lac probe exemplifies a modular and scalable route to develop selective probes with different recognizing moieties.

         <title>Trypsiligase&#8208;catalyzed labeling of proteins on living cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent fusion proteins are powerful tools for studying biological processes in living cells, but universal application is limited due to the voluminous size of those tags which may impact the folding, localization or even the biological function of the target protein. The designed biocatalyst Trypsiligase enables site&#8208;directed linkage of small&#8208;sized fluorescence dyes on the N&#8208;terminus of integral target proteins located in the outer membrane of living cells via a stable native peptide bond. The function of the approach was tested using the examples of covalent derivatization of the transmembrane proteins CD147 as well as the EGF receptor, both presented on human HeLa cells. Specific Trypsiligase recognition of the site of linkage was mediated by the dipeptide sequence Arg&#8208;His added to the proteins&#8217; native N&#8208;termini, pointing outside the cell membrane. The labeling procedure takes only about 5 minutes, as demonstrated for couplings of the fluorescence dye tetramethyl rhodamine and the affinity label biotin as well.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Hot&#8208;Spot Analysis of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Receptor Binding Domain / ACE2 Complex</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Infection and replication of SARS CoV&#8208;2 (the virus that causes COVID&#8208;19) requires entryto the interior of host cells. In humans, a Protein&#8208;Protein Interaction (PPI) between theSARS CoV&#8208;2 Receptor&#8208;Binding Domain (RBD) and the extracellular peptidase domain ofACE2, on the surface of cells in the lower respiratory tract, is an initial step in the entrypathway. Inhibition of the SARS CoV&#8208;2 RBD / ACE2 PPI is currently being evaluated asa target for therapeutic and/or prophylactic intervention. However, relatively little is knownabout the molecular underpinnings of this complex. Employing multiple computationalplatforms, we predicted &#8216;hot&#8208;spot&#8217; residues in a positive control PPI (PMI / MDM2) and theCoV&#8208;2 RBD/ACE2 complex. Computational alanine scanning mutagenesis wasperformed to predict changes in Gibbs&#8217; free energy that are associated with mutatingresidues at the positive control (PMI/MDM2) or SARS RBD/ACE2 binding interface toalanine. Additionally, we used the Adaptive Poisson&#8208;Boltzmann Solver to calculatemacromolecular electrostatic surfaces at the interface of the positive control PPI andSARS CoV&#8208;2 / ACE2 PPI. Finally, a comparative analysis of hot&#8208;spot residues for SARSCoVand SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, in complex with ACE2, is provided. Collectively, this studyilluminates predicted hot&#8208;spot residues, and clusters, at the SARS CoV&#8208;2 RBD / ACE2binding interface, potentially guiding the development of reagents capable of disruptingthis complex and halting COVID&#8208;19.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple and selective: A standing challenge in modern drug development is to simplify synthetic routes to complex molecules. Capitalizing on their exquisite selectivity, biocatalysts provide a complementary solution to traditional chemical synthesis. This viewpoint highlights the strategic application of biocatalyst to enable efficient access to complex drug molecules.







Abstract
Biocatalysis is a continuously expanding subfield in chemical biology. Herein, I describe two categories of biocatalysts, the LEGO&#8208;brick&#8208;like and game&#8208;console&#8208;like type, both of which can streamline the synthetic routes to therapeutics. A multi&#8208;disciplinary approach to expand the biocatalytic toolkit will open up opportunities to develop new therapeutics.

         <title>Zn2+&#8208;Dependent DNAzymes: From Solution Chemistry to Analytical, Materials and Therapeutic Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Being a Lewis acid, Zn2+ can bind to both the phosphate backbone and the nucleobases of DNA. This article reviews DNAzymes that use Zn2+ as a cofactor with an emphasis on the hydrolysis of Zn2+. Various applications of the DNAzymes are also discussed.







Abstract
Since 1994, deoxyribozymes or DNAzymes have been in&#8197;vitro selected to catalyze various types of reactions. Metal ions play a critical role in DNAzyme catalysis, and Zn2+ is a very important one among them. Zn2+ has good biocompatibility and can be used for intracellular applications. Chemically, Zn2+ is a Lewis acid and it can bind to both the phosphate backbone and the nucleobases of DNA. Zn2+ undergoes hydrolysis even at neutral pH, and the partially hydrolyzed polynuclear complexes can affect the interactions with DNA. These features have made Zn2+ a unique cofactor for DNAzyme reactions. This review summarizes Zn2+&#8208;dependent DNAzymes with an emphasis on RNA&#8208;/DNA&#8208;cleaving reactions. A key feature is the sharp Zn2+ concentration and pH&#8208;dependent activity for many of the DNAzymes. The applications of these DNAzymes as biosensors for Zn2+, as therapeutic agents to cleave intracellular RNA, and as chemical biology tools to manipulate DNA are discussed. Future studies can focus on the selection of new DNAzymes with improved performance and detailed biochemical characterizations to understand the role of Zn2+, which can facilitate practical applications of Zn2+&#8208;dependent DNAzymes.

         <title>Electrochemical Quantification of Neurotransmitters in Single Live Cell Vesicles Shows Exocytosis is Predominantly Partial</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Partial release mechanism of exocytosis: This minireview highlights the recent progress in amperometric measurement for monitoring exocytosis from single cells, and electrochemical cytometry measurement of vesicular neurotransmitter content in individual vesicles. Evidence from several studies supports the hypothesis that partial release is the primary mechanism during regular exocytosis.







Abstract
Exocytosis plays an essential role in the communication between cells in the nervous system. Understanding the regulation of neurotransmitter release during exocytosis and the amount of neurotransmitter content that is stored in vesicles is of importance, as it provides fundamental insights to understand how the brain works and how neurons elicit a certain behavior. In this minireview, we summarize recent progress in amperometric measurements for monitoring exocytosis in single cells and electrochemical cytometry measurements of vesicular neurotransmitter content in individual vesicles. Important steps have increased our understanding of the different mechanisms of exocytosis.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Partial release mechanism of exocytosis&lt;/b&gt;: This minireview highlights the recent progress in amperometric measurement for monitoring exocytosis from single cells, and electrochemical cytometry measurement of vesicular neurotransmitter content in individual vesicles. Evidence from several studies supports the hypothesis that partial release is the primary mechanism during regular exocytosis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exocytosis plays an essential role in the communication between cells in the nervous system. Understanding the regulation of neurotransmitter release during exocytosis and the amount of neurotransmitter content that is stored in vesicles is of importance, as it provides fundamental insights to understand how the brain works and how neurons elicit a certain behavior. In this minireview, we summarize recent progress in amperometric measurements for monitoring exocytosis in single cells and electrochemical cytometry measurements of vesicular neurotransmitter content in individual vesicles. Important steps have increased our understanding of the different mechanisms of exocytosis. Increasing evidence is firmly establishing that partial release is the primary mechanism of release in multiple cell types.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tackling COVID&#8208;19 Using Remdesivir and Favipiravir as Therapeutic Options</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
COVID&#8208;19 is a pandemic that requires global action. This review presents the latest status of research on the use of two drugs (favipiravir and remdesivir) in tackling COVID&#8208;19, and offers an overview of the life cycle and routes of transmission of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. It is hoped that the opportunities and challenges brought about by the use of these two drugs can be illuminated for future research.







Abstract
The human world is currently influenced largely by the outbreak of pandemic COVID&#8208;19. At this moment, most researchers focus on developing treatment strategies and measures to work against COVID&#8208;19. Treatment strategies specific for COVID&#8208;19 are lacking. This article provides an overview of the life cycle and routes of transmission of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. The therapeutic effects of two drugs [i.&#8201;e., remdesivir (RDV) and favipiravir (FPV)] which can potentially tackle COVID&#8208;19 are discussed based on current published data. This review can serve as a reference for future studies.

         <title>Challenges of Using Expansion Microscopy for Super&#8208;resolved Imaging of Cellular Organelles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In Expansion Microscopy (ExM) subcellular structures are imaged in isotropically expanded fixed samples, consequently allowing to resolve enlarged subcellular structures, otherwise hidden to standard microscopy. Upon comparison of the expansion factors of different cellular compartments in cells within the same gel, we found significant differences in expansion factors of a factor of above 2.







Abstract
Expansion microscopy (ExM) has been successfully used to improve the spatial resolution when imaging tissues by optical microscopy. In ExM, proteins of a fixed sample are crosslinked to a swellable acrylamide gel, which expands when incubated in water. Therefore, ExM allows enlarged subcellular structures to be resolved that would otherwise be hidden to standard confocal microscopy. Herein, we aim to validate ExM for the study of peroxisomes, mitochondria, nuclei and the plasma membrane. Upon comparison of the expansion factors of these cellular compartments in HEK293 cells within the same gel, we found significant differences, of a factor of above 2, in expansion factors. For peroxisomes, the expansion factor differed even between peroxisomal membrane and matrix marker; this underlines the need for a thorough validation of expansion factors of this powerful technique. We further give an overview of possible quantification methods for the determination of expansion factors of intracellular organelles, and we highlight some potentials and challenges.

         <title>Self&#8208;organization Properties of a GPCR&#8208;Binding Peptide with a Fluorinated Tail Studied by Fluorine NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Form and re&#8208;form: F8&#8208;Ap, a bioactive apelin&#8208;17 peptide grafted with a fluorocarbon chain at its N&#8208;terminal extremity presents self&#8208;organization properties. 19F NMR exchange spectroscopy and translational diffusion measurements were used to investigate this phenomenon. F8&#8208;Ap forms micelles of defined size with a fast exchange of peptides between free and micellar states.







Abstract
Conjugation of the bioactive apelin&#8208;17 peptide with a fluorocarbon chain results in self&#8208;organization of the peptide into micelles. Fluorine NMR spectroscopy studies show that the fluoropeptide&#8216;s micelles are monodisperse, while proton NMR indicates that the peptide moiety remains largely disordered despite micellization. A very fast exchange rate is measured between the free and micellar states of the peptide which enables the number of molecules present in the micelle to be estimated as 200, in agreement with values found by dynamic light scattering measurements.

         <title>Efficient Editing of Silver Nanoclusters by Changing Simply One Cytosine in DNA Template</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA with genetic information was edited to regulate and repair the structure and function of the protein. In DNA nanotechnology, DNA with programmable information can be designed to edit fluorescence intensity and emissive colors of DNA&#8208;stabilized silver nanoclusters (DNA/AgNCS). By introducing and moving one cytosine in spacer of emitter domain, we have built up a simple strategy to regulate excitation and emission wavelength of AgNCs. With replacement of thymine in the spacer of emitter with one cytosine, the expected excitation and emission change don&#8217;t occur. However, after moving the introduced cytosine, DNA templates produce AgNCs with extremely different excitation and emission wavelength compared to the initial template, obtaining one template for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissive species with the highest fluorescence intensity. The formation of AgNCs induces DNA template into condensed secondary structure based on altered migration rate on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The simple strategy by moving one cytosine in spacer in emitter domain can enrich the library of templates for synthesizing diverse DNA/AgNCs and have a great potential in bioimaging and probe design.</dc:description>

Turn it on: Efficacy of traditional small molecules/inhibitors relies on achieving optimal target/ligand occupancy. New concepts, such as gain&#8208;of&#8208;function, are beginning to break these shackles. Discussed herein is the current knowledge about small molecule&#8208;induced gain&#8208;of&#8208;function and how emerging data and paradigms could prove useful in harnessing this powerful concept.







Abstract
The pressing need for innovation in drug discovery is spurring the emergence of drugs that turn on protein function, as opposed to shutting activity down. Several pharmacophores usher protein target gain&#8208;of&#8208;function, for instance: PROTACs promote protein target degradation; other drug candidates have been reported to function through dominant&#8208;negative inhibition of their target enzyme. Such classes of molecules are typically active at low target occupancy and display numerous advantages relative to canonical inhibitors, whose function is intrinsically tied to achieving, or exceeding a threshold occupancy. However, our ability to generally tap into gain&#8208;of&#8208;function processes through small molecule interventions is overall in its infancy. Herein, I outline how chemical biology is poised to help us bring this powerful idea to fruition. I further outline means through which gain&#8208;of&#8208;function events can be identified and harnessed.

         <title>Enzymatic Modification of Cellulose To Unlock Its Exploitation in Advanced Materials</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Promising new biomaterials: Cellulose, the most abundant natural polymer, is of great interest for industrial use, due to its low cost, chemical stability, mechanical properties and recyclability. The application of different enzyme&#8208;based processes to modify cellulose are reviewed here. The type of reaction, the mediators, substrates and enzymes used and the properties of cellulose derivatives are discussed in detail.







Abstract
Nowadays natural biopolymers have a wide variety of uses in various industrial applications, such as food, adhesives and composite materials. Among them, cellulose has attracted the interest of researchers due to its properties: high strength and flexibility, biocompatibility and nontoxicity. Despite that, in many cases its practical use is limited because of poor solubility and/or an unsuitable hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance. In this context, enzymatic modification appears as a powerful strategy to overcome these problems through selective, green and environmentally friendly processes. This minireview discusses the different methods developed for the enzymatic modification of cellulose, emphasizing the type of reaction, the enzymes used (laccases, esterases, lipases, hexokinases, etc.), and the properties and applications of the cellulose derivatives obtained. Considering that cellulose is the most abundant natural polymer on Earth and can be derived from residual lignocellulosic biomass, the impact of its use in bio&#8208;based process following the logic of the circular economy is relevant.

The type of reaction, the mediators, substrates and enzymes used and the properties of cellulose derivatives are discussed in detail.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays natural biopolymers have a wide variety of uses in various industrial applications, such as food, adhesives and composite materials. Among them, cellulose has attracted the interest of researchers due to its properties: high strength and flexibility, biocompatibility and nontoxicity. Despite that, in many cases its practical use is limited because of poor solubility and/or an unsuitable hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance. In this context, enzymatic modification appears as a powerful strategy to overcome these problems through selective, green and environmentally friendly processes. This minireview discusses the different methods developed for the enzymatic modification of cellulose, emphasizing the type of reaction, the enzymes used (laccases, esterases, lipases, hexokinases, etc.), and the properties and applications of the cellulose derivatives obtained. Considering that cellulose is the most abundant natural polymer on Earth and can be derived from residual lignocellulosic biomass, the impact of its use in bio&#8208;based process following the logic of the circular economy is relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Revision of the Cyclisation Mechanism for the Diterpene Spiroviolene and Investigations of Its Mass Spectrometric Fragmentation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Second thoughts: After the structural revision of the bacterial diterpene spiroviolene its biosynthesis is revisited and can now be integrated into a unified scheme with related fungal compounds such as the cyclopiane&#8208;type diterpenes and spirograterpene&#8197;A. An isotopic labelling study giving insights into the EI&#8208;MS fragmentation mechanism of spiroviolene is presented.







Abstract
The diterpene spiroviolene, its diterpene synthase from Streptomyces violens and the experimentally determined terpene cyclisation mechanism were reported in 2017. Recently, the structure of spiroviolene was revised based on a total synthesis, with consequences for the cyclisation mechanism. Herein, a reinvestigation of the terpene cyclisation to spiroviolene and the mass spectrometric fragmentation mechanism investigated by 13C&#8208;labelling experiments are presented.

         <title>The Antibacterial Drug Candidate SBC3 is a Potent Inhibitor of Bacterial Thioredoxin Reductase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem for public health and associated with increasing economic costs and mortality rates. Silver and silver related compounds have been used for centuries due to their antimicrobial properties. In this work, we show that SBC3 (1,3&#8208;dibenzyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene silver(I) acetate / NHC*&#8208;Ag&#8208;OAc) is a reversible, high affinity inhibitor of  E. coli  thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) (K  i  = 10.8 &#177; 1.2 nM). MIC&#8208;tests with different  E. coli  and  P. aeruginosa  strains demonstrated that SBC3 can efficiently inhibit bacterial cell growth, especially in combination with established antibiotics like gentamicin. Our results show that SBC3 is a promising antibiotic drug candidate targeting bacterial TrxR.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitchable Lipids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Process control: Photoswitchable lipids enable optical control of lipid&#8208;mediated biological processes. These include many aspects of membrane biophysics as well as pathways that involve the molecular targets of lipids, such as ion channels, GPCRs, NHRs, and enzymes. Herein, we provide an overview of the existing technologies and discuss opportunities for new photolipids.







Abstract
Photoswitchable lipids are emerging tools for the precise manipulation and study of lipid function. They can modulate many aspects of membrane biophysics, including permeability, fluidity, lipid mobility and domain formation. They are also very useful in lipid physiology and enable optical control of a wide array of lipid receptors, such as ion channels, G protein&#8208;coupled receptors, nuclear hormone receptors, and enzymes that translocate to membranes. Enzymes involved in lipid metabolism often process them in a light&#8208;dependent fashion. Photoswitchable lipids complement other functionalized lipids widely used in lipid chemical biology, including isotope&#8208;labeled lipids (lipidomics), fluorescent lipids (imaging), bifunctional lipids (lipid&#8211;protein crosslinking), photocaged lipids (photopharmacology), and other labeled variants.

         <title>Directed Evolution of a Cp*RhIII&#8208;Linked Biohybrid Catalyst Based on a Screening Platform with Affinity Purification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More accurate library screening: A new high&#8208;throughput screening platform including affinity purification has been developed based on an in&#8197;vitro screening approach for MBP&#8208;tagged nitrobindin having a Cp*RhIII complex as an artificial cofactor. Using this platform for directed evolution, a biohybrid catalyst with clearly enhanced activity toward the cycloaddition of acetophenone oximes with alkynes was obtained.







Abstract
Directed evolution of Cp*RhIII&#8208;linked nitrobindin (NB), a biohybrid catalyst, was performed based on an in&#8197;vitro screening approach. A key aspect of this effort was the establishment of a high&#8208;throughput screening (HTS) platform that involves an affinity purification step employing a starch&#8208;agarose resin for a maltose binding protein (MBP) tag. The HTS platform enables efficient preparation of the purified MBP&#8208;tagged biohybrid catalysts in a 96&#8208;well format and eliminates background influence of the host E. coli cells. Three rounds of directed evolution and screening of more than 4000 clones yielded a Cp*RhIII&#8208;linked NB(T98H/L100K/K127E) variant with a 4.9&#8208;fold enhanced activity for the cycloaddition of acetophenone oximes with alkynes. It is confirmed that this HTS platform for directed evolution provides an efficient strategy for generating highly active biohybrid catalysts incorporating a synthetic metal cofactor.

         <title>Assessment of Tractable Cysteines for Covalent Targeting by Screening Covalent Fragments</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A toolbox of covalent fragments containing chemically diverse electrophilic warheads is presented. By screening this library against a set of enzymes amenable for covalent inhibition, we experimentally characterized the accessibility and reactivity of targeted cysteines. We propose this approach be used as an experimental method for warhead selection in the development of targeted covalent inhibitors or irreversible probes.







Abstract
Targeted covalent inhibition and the use of irreversible chemical probes are important strategies in chemical biology and drug discovery. To date, the availability and reactivity of cysteine residues amenable for covalent targeting have been evaluated by proteomic and computational tools. Herein, we present a toolbox of fragments containing a 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl core that was equipped with chemically diverse electrophilic warheads showing a range of reactivities. We characterized the library members for their reactivity, aqueous stability and specificity for nucleophilic amino acids. By screening this library against a set of enzymes amenable for covalent inhibition, we showed that this approach experimentally characterized the accessibility and reactivity of targeted cysteines. Interesting covalent fragment hits were obtained for all investigated cysteine&#8208;containing enzymes.

         <title>A methionine chemical shift based order parameter characterizing global protein dynamics.</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coupling of side chain dynamics over long distances is an important component of allosterism. Methione side chains show the largest intrinsic flexibility among methyl containing residues but the actual degree of conformational averaging depends on the proximity and mobility of neighbor residues.Carbon 13 NMR chemical shifts of methyl groups of methionine residues located at long distances in the same protein show a similar scaling with respect to the values predicted from the static X&#8208;ray structure by quantum methods. This results in a good linear correlation between calculated and observed chemical shifts.&#160;The slope is protein dependent and ranges from zero for the highly flexible calmodulin to 0.7 for the much more rigid calcineurin catalytic domain. The linear correlation is indicative of a similar level of side chain conformational averaging over long distances and the slope of the correlation line can be interpreted as an order parameter of the global side chain flexibility.</dc:description>

The linear correlation is indicative of a similar level of side chain conformational averaging over long distances and the slope of the correlation line can be interpreted as an order parameter of the global side chain flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Activation of Protease and Luciferase Using Engineered Nostoc punctiforme PCC73102 DnaE Intein with Altered Split Position</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Positive discrimination: We engineered N. punctiforme PCC73102 DnaE inteins in which the N&#8208;intein consists of 11 amino acids, and active intein variants were used to construct a turn&#8208;on system for enzyme activities such as HIV&#8208;1 protease and NanoLuc luciferase. Preferential pairing of the splicing was designed, and their reactions were monitored and discriminated by using BRET.







Abstract
Inteins, self&#8208;catalytic enzymes, have been widely used in the field of protein engineering and chemical biology. Here, Nostoc punctiforme PCC73102 (Npu) DnaE intein was engineered to have an altered split position. An 11&#8208;residue N&#8208;intein of DnaE in which Gly and Asp were substituted for Tyr4 and Glu5, respectively, was designed, and the active C&#8208;intein variants were acquired by a GFP fluorescence&#8208;based screening. The designed N&#8208;intein and the obtained active C&#8208;intein variants were used to construct a turn&#8208;on system for enzyme activities such as human immunodeficiency 1 protease and NanoLuc luciferase. Based on the NanoLuc&#8208;intein fusion, we developed two intein pairs, each of which is capable of reacting preferentially, by interchanging the charged amino acids on N&#8208; and C&#8208;inteins. The specific splicing reactions were easily monitored and discriminated by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET).

         <title>Building up PtII&#8722;Thiosemicarbazone&#8722;Lysine&#8722;sC18 Conjugates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Late&#8208;stage labelling: Chiral pyridine&#8208;carbaldehyde (S)&#8208;N4&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;methylbenzyl)thiosemicarbazones were lysine modified (TSCLp) and covalently conjugated to the cell&#8208;penetrating peptide sC18 by SPPS. Very stable PtII complexes [Pt(TSC)X] (X=Cl or CN) were synthesised, and the biological activity of the TSCLp, conjugate TSCL&#8208;sC18, or Pt conjugate complexes was studied.







Abstract
Three chiral tridentate N^N^S coordinating pyridine&#8208;carbaldehyde (S)&#8208;N4&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;methylbenzyl)thiosemicarbazones (HTSCmB) were synthesised along with lysine&#8208;modified derivatives. One of them was selected and covalently conjugated to the cell&#8208;penetrating peptide sC18 by solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. The HTSCmB model ligands, the HTSCLp derivatives and the peptide conjugate rapidly and quantitatively form very stable PtII chlorido complexes [Pt(TSC)Cl] when treated with K2PtCl4 in solution. The Pt(CN) derivatives were obtained from one TSCmB model complex and the peptide conjugate complex through Cl&#8722;&#8594;CN&#8722; exchange. Ligands and complexes were characterised by NMR, IR spectroscopy, HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS and single&#8208;crystal XRD. Intriguingly, no decrease in cell viability was observed when testing the biological activity of the lysine&#8208;tagged HdpyTSCLp, its sC18 conjugate HdpyTSCL&#8208;sC18 or the PtCl and Pt(CN) conjugate complexes in three different cell lines. Thus, given the facile and effective preparation of such Pt&#8208;TSC&#8208;peptide conjugates, these systems might pave the way for future use in late&#8208;stage labelling with Pt radionuclides and application in nuclear medicine.

         <title>Covalent Linkage and Macrocylization Preserve and Enhance Synergistic Interactions in Catalytic Amyloids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How might complexity arise from short peptides? Synergistic interactions between the side chains of catalytic amyloids are locked into place by linkers between the peptides, and these new designs result in faster assembly and asymmetric assemblies. These could serve as a potential link in the evolutionary path between abiotic peptides and complex enzymes.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of short peptides into catalytic amyloid&#8208;like nanomaterials has proven to be a powerful tool in both understanding the evolution of early proteins and identifying new catalysts for practically useful chemical reactions. Here we demonstrate that both parallel and antiparallel arrangements of &#946;&#8208;sheets can accommodate metal ions in catalytically productive coordination environments. Moreover, synergistic relationships, identified in catalytic amyloid mixtures, can be captured in macrocyclic and sheet&#8208;loop&#8208;sheet species, that offer faster rates of assembly and provide more complex asymmetric arrangements of functional groups, thus paving the way for future designs of amyloid&#8208;like catalytic proteins. Our findings show how initial catalytic activity in amyloid assemblies can be propagated and improved in more&#8208;complex molecules, providing another link in a complex evolutionary chain between short, potentially abiotically produced peptides and modern&#8208;day enzymes.

         <title>C&#8208;Terminal Tag Location Hampers in Vitro Profiling of OGT Peptide Substrates by mRNA Display</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improving the odds: In vitro mRNA display&#8208;based ultra&#8208;high&#8208;throughput selection is shown here to be a feasible approach to selectively enrich peptide substrates of O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase from the background of a random library. We identify and solve two crucial challenges to high&#8208;throughput profiling of peptide substrates of glycosyltransferases, working towards a universally applicable system.







Abstract
O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is the only enzyme that catalyzes the post&#8208;translational modification of proteins at Ser/Thr with a single &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAcylation). Its activity has been associated with chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes and neurodegenerative disease. Although numerous OGT substrates have been identified, its accepted substrate scope can still be refined. We report here an attempt to better define the peptide&#8208;recognition requirements of the OGT active site by using mRNA display, taking advantage of its extremely high throughput to assess the substrate potential of a library of all possible nonamer peptides. An antibody&#8208;based selection process is described here that is able to enrich an OGT substrate peptide from such a library, but with poor absolute recovery. Following four rounds of selection for O&#8208;GlcNAcylated peptides, sequencing revealed 14&#8197;peptides containing Ser/Thr, but these were shown by luminescence&#8208;coupled assays and peptide microarray not to be OGT substrates. By contrast, subsequent testing of an N&#8208;terminal tag approach showed exemplary recovery. Our approach demonstrates the power of genetically encoded libraries for selection of peptide substrates, even from a very low initial starting abundance and under suboptimal conditions, and emphasizes the need to consider the binding biases of antibodies and both C&#8208; and N&#8208;terminal tags in profiling peptide substrates by high&#8208;throughput display.

         <title>Photo&#8208;biocatalytic Cascades: Combining Chemical and Enzymatic Transformations Fueled by Light</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light'em up! The combination of photo&#8208;chemocatalytic and biocatalytic transformations represents an elegant strategy to extend the photo&#8208;biocatalytic toolbox for the synthesis of various pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. This review presents recent achievements in the field and highlights promising strategies to overcome incompatibility issues.







Abstract
In the field of green chemistry, light &#8211; an attractive natural agent &#8211; has received particular attention for driving biocatalytic reactions. Moreover, the implementation of light to drive (chemo)enzymatic cascade reactions opens up a golden window of opportunities. However, there are limitations to many current examples, mostly associated with incompatibility between the enzyme and the photocatalyst. Additionally, the formation of reactive radicals upon illumination and the loss of catalytic activities in the presence of required additives are common observations. As outlined in this review, the main question is how to overcome current challenges to the exploitation of light to drive (chemo)enzymatic transformations. First, we highlight general concepts in photo&#8208;biocatalysis, then give various examples of photo&#8208;chemoenzymatic (PCE) cascades, further summarize current synthetic examples of PCE cascades and discuss strategies to address the limitations.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Light'em up&lt;/b&gt;! The combination of photo&#8208;chemocatalytic and biocatalytic transformations represents an elegant strategy to extend the photo&#8208;biocatalytic toolbox for the synthesis of various pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. This review presents recent achievements in the field and highlights promising strategies to overcome incompatibility issues.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the field of green chemistry, light &#8211; an attractive natural agent &#8211; has received particular attention for driving biocatalytic reactions. Moreover, the implementation of light to drive (chemo)enzymatic cascade reactions opens up a golden window of opportunities. However, there are limitations to many current examples, mostly associated with incompatibility between the enzyme and the photocatalyst. Additionally, the formation of reactive radicals upon illumination and the loss of catalytic activities in the presence of required additives are common observations. As outlined in this review, the main question is how to overcome current challenges to the exploitation of light to drive (chemo)enzymatic transformations. First, we highlight general concepts in photo&#8208;biocatalysis, then give various examples of photo&#8208;chemoenzymatic (PCE) cascades, further summarize current synthetic examples of PCE cascades and discuss strategies to address the limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A High&#8208;throughput Screening Method for the Directed Evolution of Hydroxynitrile Lyase towards Cyanohydrin Synthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral cyanohydrins are useful intermediates in pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. In nature, hydroxynitrile lyases (HNLs) represent a kind of elegant tool for enantioselective hydrocyanation of carbonyl compounds. Currently available methods for demonstration of hydrocyanation reaction still stalled at precise but low throughput GC or HPLC analyses. Herein we report a chromogenic high&#8208;throughput screening (HTS) method feasible for cyanohydrin synthesis reaction. This method was highly anti&#8208;interference and sensitive, and could be used to directly profile the substrate scope of HNLs neither in cell&#8208;free extract or fermentation clear broth. This HTS method was also validated by generating of new variants of  Pc  HNL5 which presented higher catalytic efficiency and stronger acidic tolerance in variant libraries.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Use of Side&#8208;Chain NMR Relaxation Data to Derive Structural and Dynamical Information on Proteins: A Case Study using Hen Lysozyme</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Values of S2CH and S2NH order parameters derived from NMR relaxation measurements on proteins cannot straightforwardly be used to determine protein structure, because they cannot be related to a single protein structure, but are defined in terms of an average over a conformational ensemble. MD simulation can generate a conformational ensemble and thus be used to restrain S2CH and S2NH order parameters towards experimentally derived target values S2CH(exp) and S2NH(exp). Application of S2CH and S2NH order&#8208;parameter restraining MD simulation to bond vectors in 63 side chains of the protein hen egg white lysozyme using 51 S2CH(exp) target values and 28 S2NH(exp) target values shows that a conformational ensemble compatible with the experimentally derived data can be obtained using this technique. It is observed that S2CH order&#8208;parameter restraining of C&#8208;H bonds in methyl groups is less reliable than S2NH order&#8208;parameter restraining, because of possibly less valid assumptions and approximations used to derive experimental S2CH(exp)&#8208;values from NMR relaxation measurements and the necessity to adopt the assumption of uniform rotational motion of methyl C&#8208;H bonds around their symmetry axis and of the independence of these motions from each other. The restrained simulations demonstrate that side chains on the protein surface are highly dynamic. Any hydrogen bonds they form and that appear in any of four different crystal structures, are fluctuating with short lifetimes in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>The charged linker modulates conformations and molecular interactions of Hsp90</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecular chaperone Hsp90 supports the functional activity of specific substrate proteins (clients). For client processing, the Hsp90 dimer undergoes a series of ATP&#8208;driven conformational rearrangements. Flexible linkers connecting the three domains of Hsp90 are crucial to enable dynamic arrangements. The long, charged linker connecting the N&#8208;terminal (NTD) and middle (MD) domains exhibits additional functions  in vitro  and  in vivo  . The structural basis for these functions remains unclear. Here, we characterize the conformation and dynamics of the linker and NTD&#8208;MD domain interactions by NMR spectroscopy. Our results reveal two regions in the linker that are dynamic and exhibit secondary structure conformations. We show that these regions mediate transient interactions with strand &#946;8 of the NTD. As a consequence, this strand detaches and exposes a hydrophobic stretch, which enables binding to clients, as we show for the p53. We propose that the charged linker plays an important regulatory role by coupling the Hsp90 NTD&#8208;MD arrangement with the accessibility of a client binding site on the NTD.</dc:description>

         <title>A luminescence based coupled enzyme assay enables high throughput quantification of the bacterial second messenger 3&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cyclic&#8208;di&#8208;AMP</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic dinucleotide signaling systems are found ubiquitously throughout nature allowing organisms to rapidly and dynamically sense and respond to alterations in their environments. In recent years, the secondary messenger, cyclic di&#8208;(3&#8217;,5&#8217;)&#8208;adenosine monophosphate (c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP), has been identified as an essential signaling molecule in a diverse array of bacterial genera. We and others have shown that defects in c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP homeostasis result in severe physiological defects and virulence attenuation in many bacterial species. Despite significant advancements in the field, there is still a major gap in the understanding of the environmental and cellular factors that influence c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP dynamics due to a lack of tools to sensitively and rapidly monitor changes in c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP levels. To address this limitation, we describe here the development of a luciferase&#8208;based coupled enzyme assay that leverages the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, CnpB, for the sensitive and high throughput quantification of 3&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP. We also demonstrate the utility of this approach for the quantification of the cyclic oligonucleotide&#8208;based anti&#8208;phage signaling system (CBASS) effector, 3&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cGAMP. These findings establish CDA&#8208;Luc as a more affordable and sensitive alternative to conventional c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP detection tools with broad utility for the study of bacterial cyclic dinucleotide physiology.</dc:description>

         <title>Optical Biosensors for Virus Detection: Prospects for COVID&#8208;19</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) caused massive worldwide disruptions due to the lack of available testing locations and equipment. The use of optical techniques for viral detection has flourished in the past 15 years, providing more reliable, inexpensive, and accurate detection methods. In the current minireview, optical phenomena including fluorescence, surface plasmons, surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), and colorimetry are discussed in the context of detecting virus pathogens. The sensitivity of a viral detection method can be dramatically improved by utilizing materials that exhibit surface plasmons or SERS, but often it requires advanced instrumentation for detection. Although fluorescence and colorimetry lack high sensitivities, they show promise as point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics because of their relatively less complicated instrumentation, ease of use, lower costs, and they do not require nucleic acid amplification. Advantages and disadvantages of each optical detection method are presented, and prospects for applying optical biosensors in COVID&#8208;19 detection are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Similar but still different &#8211; which amino acid residues are responsible for varying activities in type&#8208;III copper enzymes?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Type&#8208;III copper enzymes like polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) are omnipresent among organisms and play a significant role in the formation of pigments. PPOs comprise different enzyme groups, including tyrosinases (TYRs) and catechol oxidases (COs). TYRs catalyze the  o  &#8208;hydroxylation of monophenols and the oxidation of  o  &#8208;diphenols to the corresponding  o  &#8208;quinones (EC 1.14.18.1). In contrast, COs only catalyze the oxidation of  o  &#8208;diphenols to the corresponding  o  &#8208;quinones (EC 1.10.3.1). To date (August 2020), 102 PDB entries enclosing 18 different proteins from 16 organisms and several mutants have been reported, identifying key residues in tyrosinase activity. The structural similarity between TYRs and COs, especially within and around the active center, complicates the elucidation of their modes of action on a structural basis. However, mutagenesis studies illuminate residues which influence the two activities and prove that crystallography on its own cannot  solve  elucidate the enzymatic activity mode. Several amino acid residues around the dicopper active center have been proposed to play an essential role in the two different activities. Herein, we critically review the role of all residues identified so far that putatively affect the two activities of PPOs.</dc:description>

         <title>SynBio&#8208;SynChem Approaches to Diversifying the Pacidamycins through the Exploitation of an Observed Pictet&#8208;Spengler Reaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A spontaneous Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction has been postulated to give rise to a subset of uridyl peptide antibiotics (UPAs) naturally. The bioactivity of these compounds may be seen to be attenuated. Here, using a combination of strain engineering and synthetic chemistry, we demonstrate that Pictet&#8208;Spengler chemistry may be employed to generate even greater diversity in the UPAs. We use an engineered strain to afford access to&#160;  meta&#8208;  tyrosine containing pacidamycin 4, then apply Pictet&#8208;Spengler diversification of this compound utilising a small series of aryl&#8208;aldehydes with some Pictet&#8208;Spengler diversifications affording remarkable diastereomeric control.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing nucleolytic resistance and bioactivity of functional nucleic acids by diverse nanostructures via in situ polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional nucleic acids (FNAs) are garnering tremendous interest owing to their high modularity and unique bioactivity. Three&#8208;dimensional FNAs have been developed to overcome the issues of nuclease degradation and limited cell uptake. We herein developed a new facile approach to the synthesis of multiple three&#8208;dimensional FNA nanostructures by harnessing photo&#8208;polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly. Sgc8 aptamer and CpG oligonucleotide were modified as macro chain transfer reagents to mediate in situ polymerization and self&#8208;assembly. Diverse structures, including micelles, rods, and short worms, afford these two FNAs with higher nuclease resistance from serum, greater cellular uptake efficiency, and increased bioactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of&#160;L&#8208;lactate Dehydrogenase&#160;as a&#160;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B&#160;substrate using K&#8208;BIPS</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kinases and phosphatases are major players in a variety&#160;of cellular events, including cell signaling. Aberrant activity or&#160;mutations in kinases and phosphatases can lead to diseases, such as&#160;cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. Compared to kinases,&#160;phosphatases are understudied, which is partly a result of the limited&#160;methods to identify substrates. As a solution, we developed a&#160;proteomics&#8208;based method called Kinase&#8208;catalyzed Biotinylation to&#160;Identify Phosphatase Substrates (K&#8208;BIPS) that previously identified&#160;substrates of Ser/Thr phosphatases using small molecule inhibitors.&#160;Here, for the first time, K&#8208;BIPS was applied to identify substrates of a&#160;tyrosine phosphatase, Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B),&#160;using siRNA knockdown conditions. Eight possible substrates of&#160;PTP1B were discovered in HEK293 cells, including the known&#160;substrate Pyruvate Kinase. In addition, L&#8208;lactate Dehydrogenase&#160;(LDHA) was validated as a novel PTP1B substrate. With the ability to&#160;use knockdown conditions with Ser/Thr or Tyr phosphatases, K&#8208;BIPS&#160;represents a general discovery tool to explore phosphatases biology&#160;by identifying unanticipated substrates.</dc:description>

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The broad field of Structural DNA Nanotechnology has diverged into various areas of applications ranging from computing, photonics, synthetic biology, biosensing to in&#8208;vivo bioimaging and therapeutic delivery to name a few. Though the field began to exploit DNA to build various nanoscale architectures, it has now taken a new path to diverge from structural DNA nanotechnology to functional or applied DNA nanotechnology. More recently a third sub&#8208;branch has emerged &#8211; biologically oriented DNA nanotechnology, which seeks to explore the functionalities of combinatorial DNA devices in various biological systems. In this review, we summarize the key developments in DNA nanotechnology revealing a current trend, which merges the functionality of DNA devices with the specificity of biomolecules to access a range of functions in biological systems. This review seeks to provide a perspective on evolution and biological applications of DNA nanotechnology, where integration of DNA structures with biomolecules can now uncover phenomena of interests to biologists and biomedical scientists. Finally, we conclude with the challenges, limitations, and perspectives of DNA nanodevices in fundamental and applied research.</dc:description>

         <title>Genetic Incorporation of Selenotyrosine Significantly Improves Enzymatic Activity of Agrobacterium radiobacter Phosphotriesterase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tyrosine plays important roles in many enzyme catalysts. To facilitate enzyme design, mechanistic studies and minimize structural perturbation in the active site, here we report the genetic incorporation of a novel unnatural amino acid selenotyrosine (SeHF), which has single atom replacement in comparison to tyrosine. The  Agrobacterium radiobacter  phosphotriesterase (  ar  PTE) Tyr309SeHF mutant exhibits a significant 12&#8208;fold increase in  k  cat  and 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in  k  cat  /  K  m  at pH 7.0.  Molecular dynamics simulation  shows that the SeHF309 mutation results in a conformational switch which opens up the product release pocket and increases the product release rate, thereby elevating the overall enzyme activity. Significant improvement of the catalytic efficiency at neutral pH by single unnatural amino acid (UAA) mutation broadens the application of this enzyme, and provides valuable insights to the mechanism. Our method represents a new approach for designing enzymes with enhanced activities.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>RNA molecules can fold into complex two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional shapes that are critical for their function. Chemical probes have long been utilized to interrogate RNA structure and are now considered invaluable resources in the goal of relating structure to function. Recently, the power of deep sequencing and careful chemical probe design have merged, permitting researchers to obtain a holistic understanding of how RNA structure can be utilized to control RNA biology transcriptome&#8208;wide. Within this review, we outline the recent advancements in chemical probe design for interrogating RNA structures inside cells and discuss the recent advances in our understanding of RNA biology through the lens of chemical probing.</dc:description>
