         <title>Forward Chemical Genetic Screen for Oxygen&#8208;Dependent Cytotoxins Uncovers New Covalent Fragments that Target GPX4</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of propiolamide&#8208;based GPX4 inhibitors was discovered in an unbiased screen of 930 electrophilic fragments under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. We show that the novel GPX4 inhibitors displayed normoxia&#8208;selective toxicity, which can be expanded to canonical ferroptosis inducers in three different cell lines. This underscores the importance of tumor oxygenation when developing GPX4 inhibitors for therapeutic use.







Abstract
The identification of growth inhibitory compounds with the ability to selectively target the cellular oxygenation state may be of therapeutic interest. Here, a phenotypic screen of a&#8197;covalent fragment library revealed diverse compounds containing propiolamide warheads with selective toxicity for liver cancer cells in normoxic conditions. Target identification and validation through CETSA and direct pulldown experiments demonstrated that several compounds target glutathione peroxidase&#8197;4 (GPX4) and induce ferroptotic cell death. Although being an oxidative cell death mechanism, ferroptosis can be induced also under hypoxic conditions. Prompted by the selective toxicity discovered in the screen, we mapped the oxygen&#8208;dependence of several ferroptosis&#8208;inducing compounds across three different cell lines. These studies revealed combinations with notable reductions in sensitivity under hypoxic conditions. These observations are mechanistically interesting and may be relevant for the use of ferroptosis&#8208;inducers as anti&#8208;cancer agents.

         <title>Characterization of Fluorescent Proteins with Intramolecular Photostabilization**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An experimental strategy is introduced to characterize the effects of covalently linked photostabilizers on fluorescent proteins. &#945;&#8208;GFP variant A206C/L221C allowed attachment of photostabilizer&#8208;maleimides (trolox, nitrophenyl, cyclooctatetraene and azobenzene) on the &#946;&#8208;barrel in proximity to the chromophore. Increases of photostability were found upon conjugation of azobenzene with a photostability mechanism to be elucidated.







Abstract
Genetically encodable fluorescent proteins have revolutionized biological imaging in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro. Despite their importance, their photophysical properties, i.&#8201;e., brightness, count&#8208;rate and photostability, are relatively poor compared to synthetic organic fluorophores or quantum dots. Intramolecular photostabilizers were recently rediscovered as an effective approach to improve photophysical properties of organic fluorophores. Here, direct conjugation of triplet&#8208;state quenchers or redox&#8208;active substances creates high local concentrations of photostabilizer around the fluorophore. In this paper, we screen for effects of covalently linked photostabilizers on fluorescent proteins. We produced a double cysteine mutant (A206C/L221C) of &#945;&#8208;GFP for attachment of photostabilizer&#8208;maleimides on the &#946;&#8208;barrel near the chromophore. Whereas labelling with photostabilizers such as trolox, a&#8197;nitrophenyl group, and cyclooctatetraene, which are often used for organic fluorophores, had no effect on &#945;&#8208;GFP&#8208;photostability, a substantial increase of photostability was found upon conjugation to azobenzene. Although the mechanism of the photostabilizing effects remains to be elucidated, we speculate that the higher triplet&#8208;energy of azobenzene might be crucial for triplet&#8208;quenching of fluorophores in the blue spectral range. Our study paves the way for the development of fluorescent proteins with photostabilizers in the protein barrel by methods such as unnatural amino acid incorporation.

         <title>Enzymatic Asymmetric Reduction of Unfunctionalized C=C Bonds with Archaeal Geranylgeranyl Reductases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Archaeal geranylgeranyl reductases were tested for the biocatalytic asymmetric reduction of isolated unfunctionalized C=C bonds. The reduction of acyclic terpene chains with different head groups showed great tolerance for substrates, without affecting cyclic or terminal C=C bonds. Moreover, the introduction of a succinate hemiester significantly increased conversion. The reaction is highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective (ee&gt;99&#8201;%).







Abstract
The asymmetric reduction of activated C=C bonds such as enones is well established for non&#8208;enzymatic methods as well as in biocatalysis. However, the asymmetric reduction of unfunctionalized C=C bonds is mainly performed with transition metal catalysts whereas biocatalytic approaches are lacking. We have tested two FAD&#8208;dependent archaeal geranylgeranyl reductases (GGR) for the asymmetric reduction of isolated C=C bonds. The reduction of up to four double bonds in terpene chains with different chain lengths and head groups was confirmed. Methyl&#8208;branched E&#8208;alkenes were chemoselectively reduced in the presence of cyclic, terminal or activated alkenes. Using a removable succinate &#8220;spacer&#8221;, farnesol and geraniol could be quantitatively reduced (&gt;99&#8201;%). The reduction is strictly (R)&#8208;selective (enantiomeric excess &gt;99&#8201;%). Hence, GGRs are promising biocatalysts for the asymmetric reduction of unactivated isolated C=C bonds, opening new opportunities for the synthesis of enantiopure branched alkyl chains.

         <title>Enhancement of the Catalytic Activity of Hammerhead Ribozymes by Organic Cations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrapentylammonium (TPeA) ions can enhance the turnover activity of the long&#8208;chain hammerhead ribozyme. The bulky cation decreases the stability of base&#8208;paired secondary structures of duplex, hairpin and self&#8208;forming structures that are formed by the ribozyme and substrate strands, but does not greatly destabilize the folded tertiary ribozyme&#8208;substrate complex.







Abstract
Catalytic turnover is important for the application of ribozymes to biotechnology. However, the turnover is often impaired because of the intrinsic high stability of base pairs with cleaved RNA products. Here, organic cations were used as additives to improve the catalytic performance of hammerhead ribozyme constructs that exhibit different kinetic behaviors. Kinetic analysis of substrate cleavage demonstrated that bulky cations, specifically tetra&#8208;substituted ammonium ions containing pentyl groups or a benzyl group, have the ability to greatly increase the turnover rate of the ribozymes. Thermal stability analysis of RNA structures revealed that the bulky cations promote the dissociation of cleaved products and refolding of incorrectly folded structures with small disruption of the catalytic structure. The use of bulky cations is a convenient method for enhancing the catalytic activity of hammerhead ribozymes, and the approach may be useful for advancing ribozyme technologies.

         <title>Identification of Novel Histone Deacetylase 6&#8208;Selective Inhibitors Bearing 3,3,3&#8208;Trifluorolactic Amide (TFLAM) Motif as a Zinc Binding Group</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This picture shows the 3,3,3&#8208;trifluorolactic amide (TFLAM) motif which chelates the zinc ion of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). To identify non&#8208;hydroxamate HDAC6 inhibitors for the treatment of cancer and immunological diseases, the TFMAL motif was discovered by screening a metal chelator chemical library. Subsequent structure&#8208;based drug design led to the discovery of compounds that exhibit sufficient HDAC6 inhibitory activity and selectivity in both in vitro and in cellulo experiments. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Suzuki et&#8197;al.

         <title>Enzymatic assays to explore viral mRNA capping machinery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In eukaryotes, mRNA is modified by the addition of the 7&#8208;methylguanosine (m7G) 5&#8242; cap to protect mRNA from premature degradation, thereby enhancing translation and enabling differentiation between self (endogenous) and non&#8208;self RNAs (e.g., viral ones). Viruses often develop their own mRNA capping pathways to augment the expression of their proteins and escape host innate immune response. Insights into this capping system may provide new ideas for therapeutic interventions and facilitate drug discovery, e.g., against viruses that cause pandemic outbreaks, such as betacoronaviruses SARS&#8208;CoV (2002), MARS&#8208;CoV (2012), and the most recent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Thus, proper methods for the screening of large compound libraries are required to identify lead structures that could serve as basis for rational antiviral drug design. This review summarizes the methods that allow the monitoring of the activity and inhibition of enzymes involved in mRNA capping.</dc:description>

         <title>Diamidophosphate (DAP) &#8211; A Plausible Prebiotic Phosphorylating Reagent with a Chem to BioChem Potential?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Known since the 1890s, diamidophosphate (DAP) has been investigated within the context of its inorganic chemistry. In 1999, with the demonstration of DAP&#8217;s potential as a phosphorylating agent of sugars in aqueous medium, began the exciting phase of research about DAP&#8217;s role as a plausible prebiotic phosphorylating agent. More recently, in the last five years, there has been a steady increase in the publications that have documented the surprising versatility of DAP enabling the emergence of many classes of biomolecules of life, such as the nucleic acids, peptides and protocells. Thus, though in its infancy, DAP seems to be uniquely positioned to play a central role in modelling abiotic&#8208; to prebiotic&#8208;chemical evolution. In this context, there is a need for systematic investigations for (a) establishing DAP&#8217;s likely availability on the early Earth and (b) developing DAP&#8217;s potential as a tool for use in synthetic and bioorganic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Solid&#8208;Phase Assay for Substrate Pro&#64257;ling and Directed Evolution of Transketolase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiamine diphosphate&#8208;dependent enzymes, and specifically transketolases, form one of the most important families of biocatalytic tools for enantioselective carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation yielding various hydroxyketones of biological interest. To enable substrate profiling of transketolases for acceptance of different donors and acceptors, a simple, direct colorimetric assay based on pH reaction variation was developed to establish a high&#8208;throughput solid&#8208;phase assay. This assay reduces the screening effort in the directed evolution of transketolases, as only active variants are selected for further analysis. Transketolase activity is detected as bicarbonate anions released from the &#945;&#8208;ketoacid donor substrate, which causes the pH to rise. A pH indicator, bromothymol blue, which changes color from yellow to blue in alkaline conditions, was used to directly detect, with the naked eye, clones expressing active transketolase variants, obviating enzyme extraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Comparisons of &#946;&#8208;Hairpin Propensity Among Peptides with Homochiral or Heterochiral Strands</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Assemblies of racemic &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;forming peptides have attracted attention for biomedical applications because racemic forms of peptides can self&#8208;associate more avidly than do single enantiomers. In 1953, Pauling and Corey proposed "rippled &#946;&#8208;sheet" modes of H&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated interstrand assembly for alternating L&#8208; and D&#8208;peptide strands; this structural hypothesis was complementary to their proposal of "pleated &#946;&#8208;sheet" assembly for L&#8208;peptides. Although no high&#8208;resolution structure has been reported for a rippled &#946;&#8208;sheet, there is strong evidence for the occurrence of rippled &#946;&#8208;sheets in racemic peptide assemblies. Here we compare propensities of peptide diastereomers in aqueous solution to form a minimum increment of &#946;&#8208;sheet in which two antiparallel strands associate. &#946;&#8208;Hairpin folding is observed for homochiral peptides with aligned nonpolar side chains, but no &#946;&#8208;hairpin population can be detected for diastereomers in which one strand contains L residues and the other contains D residues. These observations suggest that rippled &#946;&#8208;sheet assemblies are stabilized by interactions between &#946;&#8208;sheet layers rather than interactions within these layers.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide&#8208;PAINT enables investigation of endogenous talin with molecular scale resolution in cells and tissues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Talin is a cell adhesion molecule that is indispensable for the development and function of multicellular organisms. Despite its central role for many cell biological processes, suitable methods to investigate the nanoscale organization of talin in its native environment are missing. Here, we overcome this limitation by combining single&#8208;molecule resolved PAINT imaging with the IRIS approach enabling the quantitative analysis of genetically unmodified talin molecules in cells. We demonstrate that a previously reported peptide can be utilized to specifically label the two major talin isoforms expressed in mammalian tissues with a localization precision of &lt;10&#160;nm. Our experiments show that the methodology performs equally well as state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art single&#8208;molecule localization techniques, and the first applications reveal a thus far undescribed cell adhesion structure in differentiating stem cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of this Peptide&#8208;PAINT technique to mouse tissues paving the way to single&#8208;protein imaging of endogenous talin proteins under physiologically relevant conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Per&#8208;glycosylation of the Surface&#8208;Accessible Lysines: One&#8208;Pot Aqueous Route to Stabilized Proteins with Native Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 14, Page 2478-2485, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical glycosylation of proteins is achieved via a one&#8208;pot aqueous protocol, to pursue indiscriminate modification of the surface accessible amines. This facile method, drastically simpler than site&#8208;specific glycosylation, afforded a highly desired stabilization of proteins against aggregation and fibrillation, with a minimal change to the protein activity.







Abstract
Chemical glycosylation of proteins is a powerful tool applied widely in biomedicine and biotechnology. However, it is a challenging undertaking and typically relies on recombinant proteins and site&#8208;specific conjugations. The scope and utility of this nature&#8208;inspired methodology would be broadened tremendously by the advent of facile, scalable techniques in glycosylation, which are currently missing. In this work, we investigated a one&#8208;pot aqueous protocol to achieve indiscriminate, surface&#8208;wide glycosylation of the surface accessible amines (lysines and/or N&#8208;terminus). We reveal that this approach afforded minimal if any change in the protein activity and recognition events in biochemical and cell culture assays, but at the same time provided a significant benefit of stabilizing proteins against aggregation and fibrillation &#8208; as demonstrated on serum proteins (albumins and immunoglobulin G, IgG), an enzyme (uricase), and proteins involved in neurodegenerative disease (&#945;&#8208;synuclein) and diabetes (insulin). Most importantly, this highly advantageous result was achieved via a one&#8208;pot aqueous protocol performed on native proteins, bypassing the use of complex chemical methodologies and recombinant proteins.

         <title>Caged Cumate Enables Proximity&#8208;Dependent Control Over Gene Expression</title>

A new strategy for visualizing cellular interactions was developed based on the cumate genetic switch. Nitrile&#8208;caged cumate released by activator cells induces gene expression in neighboring reporter cells.







Abstract
Cell&#8208;cell interactions underlie diverse physiological processes yet remain challenging to examine with conventional imaging tools. Here we report a novel strategy to illuminate cell proximity using transcriptional activators. We repurposed cumate, a small molecule inducer of gene expression, by caging its key carboxylate group with a nitrile. Nitrilase&#8208;expressing activator cells released the cage, liberating cumate for consumption by reporter cells. Reporter cells comprising a cumate&#8208;responsive switch expressed a target gene when in close proximity to the activator cells. Overall, this strategy provides a versatile platform to image and potentially manipulate cellular interactions over time.

         <title>Modulation of Cellular Fate of Vinyl Triarylamines through Structural Fine Tuning: To Stay or Not To Stay in the Mitochondria?</title>

Fluorescent probes based on a triphenylamine core have been designed and synthesized as cellular imaging tools for monitoring mitochondrial status. This study was carried out to decipher the mechanism of relocalization from mitochondria to nucleus under mitochondrial membrane depolarisation.







Abstract
Mitochondria are involved in many cellular pathways and dysfunctional mitochondria are linked to various diseases. Hence efforts have been made to design mitochondria&#8208;targeted fluorophores for monitoring the mitochondrial status. However, the factors that govern the mitochondria&#8208;targeted potential of dyes are not well&#8208;understood. In this context, we synthesized analogues of the TP&#8208;2Bzim probe belonging to the vinyltriphenylamine (TPA) class and already described for its capacity to bind nuclear DNA in fixed cells and mitochondria in live cells. These analogues (TP&#8208;1Bzim, TPn&#8208;2Bzim, TP1+&#8208;2Bzim, TN&#8208;2Bzim) differ in the cationic charge, the number of vinylbenzimidazolium branches and the nature of the triaryl core. Using microscopy, we demonstrated that the cationic derivatives accumulate in mitochondria but do not reach mtDNA. Under depolarisation of the mitochondrial membrane, TP&#8208;2Bzim and TP1+&#8208;2Bzim translocate to the nucleus in direct correlation with their strong DNA affinity. This reversible phenomenon emphasizes that these probes can be used to monitor &#916;&#936;m variations.

         <title>Inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum Lysyl&#8208;tRNA Synthetase via a Piperidine&#8208;Ring Scaffold Inspired Cladosporin Analogues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 14, Page 2468-2477, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study focuses on the synthesis and structural analysis of piperidine ring inspired cladosporin inhibitors against Plasmodium falciparum lysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (PfKRS). The series retains selectivity against its human counterpart but it was observed that replacing the tetrahydropyran moiety by piperidine reduces potency. Co&#8208;crystals of Cla&#8722;B and Cla&#8722;C with PfKRS reveal key interactions and loop readjustments that allow drug binding and inhibition of the enzyme.







Abstract
Plasmodium falciparum lysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (PfKRS) represents a promising therapeutic anti&#8208;malarial target. Cladosporin was identified as a selective and potent PfKRS inhibitor but lacks metabolic stability. Here, we report chemical synthesis, biological evaluation and structural characterization of analogues where the tetrahydropyran (THP) frame of cladosporin is replaced with the piperidine ring bearing functional group variations. Thermal binding, enzymatic, kinetic and parasitic assays complemented with X&#8208;ray crystallography reveal compounds that are moderate in potency. Co&#8208;crystals of Cla&#8722;B and Cla&#8722;C with PfKRS reveal key atomic configurations that allow drug binding to and inhibition of the enzyme. Collectively these piperidine ring scaffold inhibitors lay a framework for further structural editing and functional modifications of the cladosporin scaffold to obtain a potent lead.

         <title>Biosynthesis of [14C]&#8208;11&#8208;De&#8208;O&#8208;Methyltomaymycin, a Precursor of Radiolabelled Antibody Drug Conjugates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 14, Page 2424-2429, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aim of this research was to avoid a radiolabelled multistep chemical synthesis of tomaymycin derivative using biosynthesis. The 14C radiolabel was incorporated efficiently in one step from radiolabelled tyrosine using the strain Streptomyces sp. FH6421. Optimization by using radiolabelled anthranilic acid led to one of the highest incorporation levels of radiochemical precursors published to date.







Abstract
Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are one of the most promising technologies to treat cancer as they combine the specificity of an antibody with the high potency of a cytotoxic molecule such as tomaymycin derivatives, which are DNA&#8208;interactive antitumor antibiotics previously isolated from bacterial broth. The multistep chemical synthesis of some tomaymycin derivatives is complicated because their structures contain a reactive imine bond. Therefore, we turned to biosynthesis to obtain 14C radiolabelled tomaymycin derivative to support ADME studies. Following Hurley's work (J. Antibiotics 1977, 30, 349&#8211;370; Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1979, 15, 42&#8211;45; Acc. Chem. Res. 1980, 13, 263&#8211;269), the 14C radiolabel was incorporated efficiently in one step from radiolabelled tyrosine using the strain Streptomyces sp. FH6421. This process has been further optimized by using anthranilic acid as radiolabelled precursor, leading to one of the highest incorporation levels of radiochemical precursors published to date. This biosynthetic strategy is the fastest way to access such radiolabelled precursors.

         <title>Incorporation of TePhe into Expressed Proteins is Minimally Perturbing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 14, Page 2449-2456, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using standard protein expression conditions, we demonstrate it is possible to achieve high levels of Phe to TePhe substitution. The modified protein is minimally perturbed, as judged by NMR spectroscopy and melting experiments, by this substitution that will provide the basis for new tellurium based biophysical studies.







Abstract
Tellurium is a versatile heavy chalcogen with numerous applications in chemical biology, providing valuable probes in mass cytometry, fluorescence imaging and structural biology. L&#8208;Tellurienylalanine (TePhe) is an analogue of the proteinogenic amino acid L&#8208;phenylalanine (Phe) in which the phenyl side chain has been replaced by a 5&#8208;membered tellurophene moiety. High incorporation level of TePhe in expressed proteins at defined sites is expected to facilitate studies in proteomics, protein NMR spectroscopy, and structure elucidation. As a model we chose immunoglobulin&#8208;binding Protein G, B1 domain (GB1) to validate TePhe as a suitable structural analogue for Phe. We demonstrate that approximately 1 in 2 of all Phe sites within GB1 can be substituted with TePhe through expression in standard non&#8208;Phe&#8208;auxotrophic E. coli in Phe&#8208;deficient media containing glyphosate, an inhibitor of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. The TePhe content of the GB1 sample can be further increased to 85&#8201;% through HPLC. Using NMR and CD spectroscopy, we confirm that the Phe&#8208;to&#8208;TePhe substitution has negligible impact on the global structure and stability of GB1.

The TePhe content of the GB1 sample can be further increased to 85&#8201;% through HPLC. Using NMR and CD spectroscopy, we confirm that the Phe-to-TePhe substitution has negligible impact on the global structure and stability of GB1.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Molecular Basis of Selectivity and Activity for the Antimicrobial Peptide Lynronne&#8208;1 Informs Rational Design of Peptide with Improved Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 14, Page 2430-2439, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we describe the biophysical characterization of Lynronne&#8208;1, an antimicrobial peptide found in the bovine rumen microbiome. We reveal the location of an amphipathic helix containing all six cationic residues, and observe lipid&#8208;selective folding, membrane&#8208;binding and lysis. Our structural data were used to design three variants with changes in the size of the hydrophobic helical face, one of which yielded 32&#8208;fold improved activity in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Antibiotic resistance is a significant threat to human health, with natural products remaining the best source for new antimicrobial compounds. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are natural products with great potential for clinical use as they are small, amenable to customization, and show broad&#8208;spectrum activities. Lynronne&#8208;1 is a promising AMP identified in the rumen microbiome that shows broad&#8208;spectrum activity against pathogens such as methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii. Here we investigated the structure of Lynronne&#8208;1 using solution NMR spectroscopy and identified a 13&#8208;residue amphipathic helix containing all six cationic residues. We used biophysical approaches to observe folding, membrane partitioning and membrane lysis selective to the presence of anionic lipids. We translated our understanding of Lynronne&#8208;1 structure to design peptides which varied in the size of their hydrophobic helical face. These peptides displayed the predicted continuum of membrane&#8208;lysis activities in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo, and yielded a new AMP with 4&#8208;fold improved activity against A. baumannii and 32&#8208;fold improved activity against S. aureus.

Isotopologues, enzymes that differ only in their isotopic substitution, engage in a tug of war to determine the role of protein motions and electrostatics for catalysis. The features of the ribbon diagrams indicate that the enzymes are human dihydrofolate reductases. More information can be found in the Communication by R.&#8197;K. Allemann et&#8197;al.

Developing new tools to target natural products (NPs) can be applied to isolate novel NPs from complex samples. We have developed native and deuterated chemoselective labeling probes to target phenol&#8208;containing glycopeptides by the ene&#8208;type reaction. After &#8220;clicking&#8221; with the biotin handle, the labeled NPs can be enriched, followed by the LC&#8208;MS and MSn analysis for structural prediction. Using Amycolatopsis orientalis as an example, a vancomycin&#8208;related glycopeptide was labeled and characterized by our labeling strategy, showing its potential in glycopeptide discovery.

Ranging from small&#8208;molecule metal complexes to supramolecular assembles, bioinspired catalysts possess many exciting properties that could address salient challenges in industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing. Inspired by natural enzymes, these systems have high activity, enantioselectivity, and aqueous solubility. Recent advances in synthetic enzyme models have improved our understanding of complicated biological enzymatic processes and enabled the production of catalysts with increased efficiency.







Abstract
Biomimetic catalysts, ranging from small&#8208;molecule metal complexes to supramolecular assembles, possess many exciting properties that could address salient challenges in industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing. Inspired by natural enzymes, these biohybrid catalytic systems demonstrate superior characteristics, including high activity, enantioselectivity, and enhanced aqueous solubility, over their fully synthetic counterparts. However, instability and limitations in the prediction of structure&#8208;function relationships are major drawbacks that often prevent the application of biomimetic catalysts outside of the laboratory. Despite these obstacles, recent advances in synthetic enzyme models have improved our understanding of complicated biological enzymatic processes and enabled the production of catalysts with increased efficiency. This review outlines important developments and future prospects for the design and application of bioinspired and biohybrid systems at multiple length scales for important, biologically relevant, clean energy transformations.

         <title>Functional Nucleic Acids Under Unusual Conditions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 14, Page 2368-2383, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unusual conditions, such as low solution pH, high and low temperatures, and organic solvents, were speculated to be the circumstances that ribozymes and riboswitches may have faced on the early Earth. Moreover, some artificial functional nucleic acids have been discovered to work under such unusual conditions and these molecules offer the potential for some interesting applications. Herein, we review recent progress of research on these functional nucleic acids.







Abstract
Functional nucleic acids (FNAs), including naturally occurring ribozymes and riboswitches as well as artificially created DNAzymes and aptamers, have been popular molecular toolboxes for diverse applications. Given the high chemical stability of nucleic acids and their ability to fold into diverse sequence&#8208;dependent structures, FNAs are suggested to be highly functional under unusual reaction conditions. This review will examine the progress of research on FNAs under conditions of low pH, high temperature, freezing conditions, and the inclusion of organic solvents and denaturants that are known to disrupt nucleic acid structures. The FNA species to be discussed include ribozymes, riboswitches, G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;based peroxidase mimicking DNAzymes, RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes, and aptamers. Research within this space has not only revealed the hidden talents of FNAs but has also laid important groundwork for pursuing these intriguing functional macromolecules for unique applications.

         <title>Recent Advances on the Selection Methods of DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries</title>

DNA&#8208;encoded chemical libraries (DEL) have become a major technology platform in drug discovery. Besides encoding method, DEL&#8208;compatible chemistry, and analysis of large datasets, another important but less&#8208;covered technological component of DELs is selection method. Although presently DEL selection is predominantly conducted with immobilized proteins on a matrix, the recent development of novel DEL selection methods has expanded the target scope and led to novel utilities of DELs. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive overview of DEL selection methods with a particular focus on the emerging approaches for DELs to interrogate complex biological targets.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DEL) have come of age and become a major technology platform for ligand discovery in both academia and the pharmaceutical industry. Technological maturation in the past two decades and the recent explosive developments of DEL&#8208;compatible chemistries have greatly improved the chemical diversity of DELs and fueled its applications in drug discovery. A relatively less&#8208;covered aspect of DELs is the selection method. Typically, DEL selection is considered as a binding assay and the selection is conducted with purified protein targets immobilized on a matrix, and the binders are separated from the non&#8208;binding background via physical washes. However, the recent innovations in DEL selection methods have not only expanded the target scope of DELs, but also revealed the potential of the DEL technology as a powerful tool in exploring fundamental biology. In this Review, we first cover the &#8220;classic&#8221; DEL selection methods with purified proteins on solid phase, and then we discuss the strategies to realize DEL selections in solution phase. Finally, we focus on the emerging approaches for DELs to interrogate complex biological targets.

         <title>Variety of Nucleotide Polymerase Mutants Aiming to Synthesize Modified RNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 14, Page 2398-2406, July 15, 2021. </description>

This review introduces several nucleotide polymerase mutants that can incorporate chemically modified nucleotides. Altering amino acid residues around the active sites effectively renders both DNA and RNA polymerases tolerant to ribose 2&#8217; modified ribonucleotide substrates. Introduction of these modifications makes RNA stable and beneficial for therapeutics.







Abstract
Significant efforts have been made to develop therapeutic RNA aptamers that exploit synthetic RNA to capture target molecules. However, ensuring RNA aptamers are resistant against intrinsic nucleases remains an issue and restricts their use as therapeutics. Introduction of chemical modifications to the 2&#8242; sugar moiety of RNA improves their stability effectively and can be achieved by chemical synthesis using modified phosphoramidites; however, this approach is not suitable for preparing long RNA molecules. Although recombinant nucleotide polymerases can transcribe RNA, these polymerases cannot synthesize modified RNA because they do not recognize 2&#8242; modified nucleoside triphosphates. In this review, we focus on several polymerase mutants that tolerate substrates containing modifications of the 2&#8242; sugar moiety to synthesize RNA, and the problems that must be overcome to prepare chemically modified RNA with high efficacy by in&#8197;vitro transcription.

         <title>Labeling and Characterization of Phenol&#8208;Containing Glycopeptides Using Chemoselective Probes with Isotope Tags</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 14, Page 2415-2419, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed native and deuterated chemoselective labeling probes to target phenol&#8208;containing glycopeptides in conjunction with LC&#8208;MS analysis. A vancomycin&#8208;related phenol&#8208;containing glycopeptide was characterized by our labeling strategy, showing its potential in glycopeptide discovery.







Abstract
Secondary metabolites are structurally diverse natural products (NPs) and have been widely used for medical applications. Developing new tools to enrich NPs can be a promising solution to isolate novel NPs from the native and complex samples. Here, we developed native and deuterated chemoselective labeling probes to target phenol&#8208;containing glycopeptides by the ene&#8208;type labeling used in proteomic research. The clickable azido&#8208;linker was included for further biotin functionalization to facilitate the enrichment of labeled substrates. Afterward, our chemoselective method, in conjunction with LC&#8208;MS and MSn analysis, was demonstrated in bacterial cultures. A vancomycin&#8208;related phenol&#8208;containing glycopeptide was labeled and characterized by our labeling strategy, showing its potential in glycopeptide discovery in complex environments.

         <title>Cryo&#8208;kinetics Reveal Dynamic Effects on the Chemistry of Human Dihydrofolate Reductase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 14, Page 2410-2414, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The results of cryo&#8208;measurements of the kinetics of the human dihydrofolate reductase (HsDHFR) catalyzed reaction and the effects of protein motion on catalysis are reported. Isotopic enzyme labeling revealed an enzyme KIE (kHLE/kHHE) close to unity above 0&#8201;&#176;C; however, the enzyme KIE was increased to 1.72&#177;0.15 at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, indicating that the coupling of protein motions to the chemical step is minimized under optimal conditions but enhanced at non&#8208;physiological temperatures.







Abstract
Effects of isotopic substitution on the rate constants of human dihydrofolate reductase (HsDHFR), an important target for anti&#8208;cancer drugs, have not previously been characterized due to its complex fast kinetics. Here, we report the results of cryo&#8208;measurements of the kinetics of the HsDHFR catalyzed reaction and the effects of protein motion on catalysis. Isotopic enzyme labeling revealed an enzyme KIE (kHLE/kHHE) close to unity above 0&#8201;&#176;C; however, the enzyme KIE was increased to 1.72&#177;0.15 at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, indicating that the coupling of protein motions to the chemical step is minimized under optimal conditions but enhanced at non&#8208;physiological temperatures. The presented cryogenic approach provides an opportunity to probe the kinetics of mammalian DHFRs, thereby laying the foundation for characterizing their transition state structure.

The presented cryogenic approach provides an opportunity to probe the kinetics of mammalian DHFRs, thereby laying the foundation for characterizing their transition state structure.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Stabilisation of the Fatty Acid Decarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis by Caprylic Acid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 14, Page 2420-2423, July 15, 2021. </description>

Keep me busy: The photoactivated fatty acid decarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis NC64&#8197;A (CvFAP) is a promising catalyst to generate next generation biodiesel from (waste) fatty acids. CvFAP, however is also plagued by pronounced photoinactivation, which can be alleviated by keeping it busy, i.&#8201;e. converting carboxylic acids such as caprylic acid.







Abstract
The fatty acid photodecarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis NC64&#8197;A (CvFAP) catalyses the light&#8208;dependent decarboxylation of fatty acids. Photoinactivation of CvFAP still represents one of the major limitations of this interesting enzyme en route to practical application. In this study we demonstrate that the photostability of CvFAP can easily be improved by the administration of medium&#8208;chain length carboxylic acids such as caprylic acid indicating that the best way of maintaining CvFAP stability is &#8216;to keep the enzyme busy&#8217;.

         <title>Hidden in plain sight:&#160;Natural products of commensal microbiota as an environmental selection pressure for the rise of new variants of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the emergence of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, little attention has been paid to the interplay between the interaction of virus and commensal microbiota. Here, we used molecular docking and dynamics simulations to study the interaction of some of the known metabolites and natural products (NPs) produced by the commensal microbiota with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein of SARS&#8208;CoV2. The results predict that NPs of commensal microbiota such as bile acids and non&#8208;ribosomal peptides (NRPs), of which some are siderophores, bind to the wild&#8208;type RBD and interfere with its binding to the ACE2 receptor. N501Y mutation, which is present in many of the emerging variants of the virus, abolishes the predicted binding pocket of bile acids and NRPs. Based on these data and available experimental data showing that bile acids reduce the binding affinity of RBD to the ACE2 receptor and that the N501Y mutation in RBD does not increase the infectivity rate of the virus in cell&#8208;based assays but in the upper respiratory airway, where commensal microbiota are present, we put forward the following proposal: mutations such as N501Y enable the RBD to more effectively bind to the ACE2 receptor in the presence of NPs produced by the upper respiratory tract bacteria thereby, increasing the infectivity rate of the virus. We hope our data stimulate future works to better understand the interactions of NPs produced by the commensal microbiota with respiratory viruses like SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>An autophagy&#8208;disrupting small molecule promotes cancer cell death via caspase activation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel autophagy inhibitor, autophazole (Atz), which promoted cancer cell death via caspase activation, was described. This substance was identified from cell&#8208;based high&#8208;content screening of an imidazole library. The results showed that Atz was internalized into lysosomes of cells where it induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). This process generated nonfunctional autolysosomes, thereby inhibiting autophagy. In addition, Atz was also found to promote LMP&#8208;mediated apoptosis. Specifically, LMP induced by Atz caused release of cathepsins from lysosomes into the cytosol. Cathepsins in the cytosol cleaved Bid to generate tBid, which subsequently activated Bax to induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). This event led to cancer cell death via caspase activation. Overall, the findings suggest that Atz will serve as a new chemical probe in efforts aimed at gaining a better understanding of the autophagic process.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of KUE&#8208;siRNA conjugates for prostate cancer cell&#8208;targeted gene silencing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The delivery of siRNAs to selectively target cells posed a great challenge in RNAi&#8208;based cancer therapy. The lack of suitable cell&#8208;targeting methods seriously restricted the advance in delivering siRNAs to extrahepatic tissues. Based on prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen (PSMA)&#8208;targeting ligands, we here synthesized a series of KUE&#8208;siRNA conjugates and verified their effective cell uptake and gene silencing properties in prostate cancers. The results indicated that the KUE&#8208;siRNA conjugates could selectively enter PSMA  +  LNCaP cells, eventually down&#8208;regulating the STAT3 expression. Based on post&#8208;synthesis modification and receptor mediated endocytosis, this strategy of constructing ligand&#8208;siRNA conjugates might provide a general method of siRNA delivery for cell&#8208;targeted gene silencing.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Light Energy Conversion with Biomimetic Vesicle Membranes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vesicles can be used for the compartmentalization of chemical reactions and self&#8208;assembly of reaction partners. This minireview highlights recent advances in biomimetic and light&#8208;induced energy conversions with liposomes and polymersomes, relevant in the context of energy transfer, electron transfer, photocatalysis and artificial photosynthesis.







Abstract
Lipid bilayer membranes are ubiquitous in natural chemical conversions. They enable self&#8208;assembly and compartmentalization of reaction partners and it becomes increasingly evident that a thorough fundamental understanding of these concepts is highly desirable for chemical reactions and solar energy conversion with artificial systems. This minireview focusses on selected case studies from recent years, most of which were inspired by either membrane&#8208;facilitated light harvesting or respective charge transfer.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vesicles&lt;/b&gt; can be used for the compartmentalization of chemical reactions and self-assembly of reaction partners. This minireview highlights recent advances in biomimetic and light-induced energy conversions with liposomes and polymersomes, relevant in the context of energy transfer, electron transfer, photocatalysis and artificial photosynthesis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipid bilayer membranes are ubiquitous in natural chemical conversions. They enable self-assembly and compartmentalization of reaction partners and it becomes increasingly evident that a thorough fundamental understanding of these concepts is highly desirable for chemical reactions and solar energy conversion with artificial systems. This minireview focusses on selected case studies from recent years, most of which were inspired by either membrane-facilitated light harvesting or respective charge transfer. The main focus is on highly biomimetic liposomes with artificial chromophores, and some cases for polymer-membranes will be made. Furthermore, we categorized these studies into energy transfer and electron transfer, with phospholipid vesicles, and polymer membranes for light-driven reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>PEGylated Oligothioetheramide Prodrugs Activated by Host Serum Proteases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High host toxicity presents a challenging barrier to clinical application of small&#8208;molecule antibiotics. PEG conjugation incorporating a reactivation mechanism triggered by host proteases effectively reduces toxicity through controlled release of the antibiotic. While highlighting the utility of synthetic, proteolytically stable compounds like oligoTEAs, this approach is translatable to similar therapeutics.







Abstract
Due to the increasing prominence of antibiotic resistance, novel drug discovery and delivery approaches targeting bacteria are essential. In this work we evaluate a prodrug design to improve the cytotoxic profile of polycationic oligothioetheramides (oligoTEAs), which are promising antimicrobials. Herein we chemically modify the oligoTEA, PDT&#8208;4G, with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) and show that 1, 2, and 5&#8197;kDa PEGs mitigate cytotoxicity. As PEGylation reduces antibacterial activity, we evaluate two peptide linkers which, unlike oligoTEAs, are susceptible to proteolytic cleavage in serum. To gain insight into the prodrug reactivation, two linkers were tested, the 5&#8208;residue peptide sequence LMPTG, and the dipeptide sequence VC&#8208;PABC. In the presence of 20&#8201;% serum, prodrugs made with the VC&#8208;PABC linker successfully inhibited bacterial growth. Overall, we observed reactivation of oligoTEAs facilitated by serum protease cleavage of the peptide linkers. This work opens the door to the future design of antimicrobial prodrugs with tunable release profiles.

         <title>Genetic Incorporation of Selenotyrosine Significantly Improves Enzymatic Activity of Agrobacterium radiobacter Phosphotriesterase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tyrosine mimic, amino acid SeHF, which has low pKa and strong nucleophilicity under physiological conditions, could significantly improve the enzymatic activity of Agrobacterium radiobacter phosphotriesterase. This approach could be used in metalloenzyme design in the future.







Abstract
Tyrosine plays important roles in many enzymes. To facilitate enzyme design, mechanistic studies and minimize structural perturbation in the active site, here we report the genetic incorporation of a novel unnatural amino acid selenotyrosine (SeHF), which has single&#8208;atom replacement in comparison to tyrosine. The arPTE&#8208;(Agrobacterium radiobacter Phosphotriesterase) Tyr309SeHF mutant exhibits a significant 12&#8208;fold increase in kcat and 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in kcat/KM at pH&#8197;7.0. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the SeHF309 mutation results in a conformational switch which opens up the product release pocket and increases the product release rate, thereby elevating the overall enzyme activity. Significant improvement of the catalytic efficiency at neutral pH by single unnatural amino acid (UAA) mutation broadens the application of this enzyme, and provides valuable insights to the mechanism. Our method represents a new approach for designing enzymes with enhanced activity.

         <title>Identification of Novel Histone Deacetylase 6&#8208;Selective Inhibitors Bearing 3,3,3&#8208;Trifluorolactic Amide (TFLAM) Motif as a Zinc Binding Group</title>

Non&#8208;hydroxamate HDAC6&#8208;selective inhibitors: We identified isoindoline compounds bearing 3,3,3&#8208;trifluorolactic amide (TFLAM) as a novel zinc binding group by screening a compound library and the subsequent structure&#8208;based drug design (SBDD). The identified inhibitor exhibited potent and selective HDAC6&#8208;inhibitory activity in cells and induced Treg cell differentiation.







Abstract
Pharmacological inhibition of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is an effective therapeutic strategy for cancer and immunological diseases. Most of the previously reported HDAC6 inhibitors have a hydroxamate group as a zinc binding group (ZBG), which coordinates to the catalytic zinc ion of HDAC6. The hydroxamate group is liable to metabolically generate mutagenetic hydroxylamine; therefore, non&#8208;hydroxamate HDAC6 inhibitors would be advantageous. In this study, to identify novel non&#8208;hydroxamate HDAC6&#8208;selective inhibitors, screening of a chemical library and the subsequent structural optimization were performed, which led to the identification of HDAC6&#8208;selective inhibitors with 3,3,3&#8208;trifluorolactic amide (TFLAM) as a novel ZBG. The identified inhibitor showed potent and selective HDAC6&#8208;inhibitory activity in cells and induced regulatory T (Treg) cell differentiation.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Small Molecule Labeling of an Internal Loop in JC Polyomavirus Pentamers Using the &#960;&#8208;Clamp&#8208;Mediated Cysteine Conjugation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Few methods exist to site&#8208;specifically label loops of globular proteins without interfering with the function of the protein. A modular &#960;&#8208;clamp reactive perfluoro&#8208;aromatic probe was synthesized in only two&#8208;steps and used to selectively modify an internal, surface exposed loop of the major capsid protein of JC polyomavirus (VP1). The perfluoro&#8208;biphenyl probe reacts selectively with the cysteine in the &#960;&#8208;clamp (Phe&#8208;Cys&#8208;Pro&#8208;Phe) over 6 native cysteines present in VP1. Using microscopy, fluorescently labeled &#960;&#8208;clamp VP1 can be observed binding and entering human glial cells. More information can be found in the Communication by F.&#8197;M. Rossi, C.&#8197;D.&#8197;S. Nelson et&#8197;al.

         <title>Evaluation of Naturally Occurring HIF&#8208;1 Inhibitors for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activation of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor (HIF&#8208;1) leads to expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase&#8197;1 (PDK1) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Six naturally occurring HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors were identified using the developed cell&#8208;based assay. Tagitinin&#8197;C (1) clearly decreased the amount of HIF&#8208;1&#946; and the HIF&#8208;1 target PDK1. HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors are thus effective in decreasing PDK1, which causes a metabolic disorder and the Warburg effect in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells.







Abstract
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare and severe progressive disorder characterized by high pulmonary artery pressure. Chronic hypoxia causes a metabolic disorder and the Warburg effect in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase&#8197;1 (PDK1) is a key enzyme in Warburg effect increased by hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor (HIF&#8208;1). We constructed a cell&#8208;based luciferase assay system for HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors. Using this system, six HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors were identified. Among these inhibitors, the effect of tagitinin&#8197;C (1) on PASMC was investigated. Tagitinin&#8197;C (1) clearly decreased the amount of HIF&#8208;1&#946; and the HIF&#8208;1 target PDK1. This result indicates that HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors effectively decrease PDK1 activity, which is a cause of the metabolic disorder and Warburg effect observed in PASMCs. Identifying naturally occurring HIF&#8208;1 inhibitors could provide novel insights into the development of PAH medications.

         <title>Photosensitized Oxidative Dimerization at Tyrosine by a Water&#8208;Soluble 4&#8208;Amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an aerobic, visible light&#8208;dependent oxidation of Tyr&#8208;containing substrates promoted by a water&#8208;soluble 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide&#8208;based photosensitizer. The developed procedure demonstrates the generation of o,o&#8217;&#8208;Tyr&#8208;Tyr linked dimers.







Abstract
The oxidation of proteins generates reactive amino acid (AA) residue intermediates, leading to protein modification and cross&#8208;linking. Aerobic studies with peptides and photosensitizers allow for the controlled generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive AA residue intermediates, providing mechanistic insights as to how natural protein modifications form. Such studies have inspired the development of abiotic methods for protein modification and crosslinking, including applications of biomedical importance. Dityrosine linkages derived from oxidation at tyrosine (Tyr) residues represent one of the more well&#8208;understood oxidation&#8208;induced modifications. Here we demonstrate an aerobic, visible light&#8208;dependent oxidation reaction of Tyr&#8208;containing substrates promoted by a water&#8208;soluble 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide&#8208;based photosensitizer. The developed procedure converts Tyr&#8208;containing substrates into o,o&#8217;&#8208;Tyr&#8208;Tyr linked dimers. The regioselectively formed o,o&#8217;&#8208;Tyr&#8208;Tyr linkage is consistent with dimeric standards prepared using a known enzymatic method. A crossover study with two peptides provides a statistical mixture of three distinct o,o&#8217;&#8208;Tyr&#8208;Tyr linked dimers, supporting a mechanism that involves Tyr residue oxidation followed by intermolecular combination.

         <title>Core Steps to the Azaphilone Family of Fungal Natural Products</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azaphilones are a polyketide&#8208;based family of fungal natural products with a highly oxygenated bicyclic pyrone&#8208;quinone structure, many of which have useful and interesting bioactivities. This minireview reveals the common steps in azaphilone biosynthetic pathways to aid the use of genome mining to identify orphan azaphilone biosynthetic gene clusters.







Abstract
Azaphilones are a family of polyketide&#8208;based fungal natural products that exhibit interesting and useful bioactivities. This minireview explores the literature on various characterised azaphilone biosynthetic pathways, which allows for a proposed consensus scheme for the production of the core azaphilone structure, as well as identifying early diversification steps during azaphilone biosynthesis. A consensus understanding of the core enzymatic steps towards a particular family of fungal natural products can aid in genome&#8208;mining experiments. Genome mining for novel fungal natural products is a powerful technique for both exploring chemical space and providing new insights into fungal natural product pathways.

         <title>Sphaeropsidin A, a pimarane diterpene with interesting biological activities and promising practical applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sphaeropsidin A (SphA) is a tetracyclic pimarane diterpene, first isolated as the main phytotoxin produced by Diplodia cupressi the causal agent of a severe canker disease of Italian cypress (Cupressus sempervirens L.). It was also produced, together with several analogues, by different pathogenic Diplodia species and other fungi and showed a broad array of biological activities suggesting its promising application in agriculture and medicine. The anticancer activity of SphA is very potent and cell specific. Recent studies have revealed its unique mode of action. This minireview reports the structures of SphA and its family of natural analogues, their biosynthetic origins, their fungal sources, and biological activities. The preparation of various SphA derivatives is also described as well as the results of structure activity relationship (SAR) studies and on their potential practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Evaluation of an E. coli cell extract prepared by lysozyme&#8208;assisted sonication via gene expression, phage assembly and proteomics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past decades, starting from crude cell extracts, a variety of successful preparation protocols and optimized reaction conditions have been established for the production of cell&#8208;free gene expression systems. One of the crucial steps during the preparation of cell extract&#8208;based expression systems is the cell lysis procedure itself, which largely determines the quality of the active components of the extract. Here we evaluate the utility of an  E. coli  cell extract, which was prepared using a combination of lysozyme incubation and a gentle sonication step. As quality measure, we demonstrate the cell&#8208;free expression of YFP at concentrations up to 0.6&#160;mg/ml. In addition, we produced and assembled T7 bacteriophages up to a titer of 10  8  PFU/ml. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantitative proteomics was used to compare the produced extracts with each other and with a commercial extract. The differences in protein composition were surprisingly small between lysozyme&#8208;assisted sonication (LAS) extracts, but we observed an increase in the release of DNA&#8208;binding proteins for increasing numbers of sonication cycles. Proteins taking part in carbohydrate metabolism, glycolysis, amino acid and nucleotide related pathways were found to be more abundant in the LAS extract, while proteins related to RNA modification and processing, DNA modification and replication, transcription regulation, initiation, termination and the TCA cycle were found enriched in the commercial extract.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered RebH halogenase variants demonstrating a specificity switch from tryptophan towards novel indole compounds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activating industrially important aromatic hydrocarbons by installing halogen atoms is extremely important in organic synthesis and often improves the pharmacological properties of drug molecules. To this end, tryptophan halogenase enzymes are potentially valuable tools for regioselective halogenation of arenes, including various industrially important indole derivatives and similar scaffolds. Although endogenous enzymes show reasonable substrate scope towards indole compounds, their efficacy can often be improved by engineering. Using a structure&#8208;guided semi&#8208;rational mutagenesis approach, we have developed two RebH variants with expanded biocatalytic repertoires that can efficiently halogenate several novel indole substrates and produce important pharmaceutical intermediates. Interestingly, the engineered enzymes are completely inactive towards their natural substrate tryptophan in spite of their high tolerance to various functional groups in the indole ring. Computational modelling and molecular dynamics simulations provide mechanistic insights into the role of gatekeeper residues in the substrate binding site and the dramatic switch in substrate specificity when these are mutated.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis Assisted Discovery of Proline&#8208;Rich Macrocyclic Peptides in Marine Sponges</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adopting an integrated approach of chemoenzymatic synthesis of standards and HCD&#8208;MSn fragmentation, we have sequenced proline&#8208;rich cyclopeptide natural products from marine sponges. Our MSn fragmentation workflow successfully differentiated between leucine and isoleucine residues in the cyclopeptides and can be used to sequence low abundance cyclic peptides from sub&#8208;gram amounts of sponge biomass.







Abstract
Proline&#8208;rich macrocyclic peptides (PRMPs) are natural products present in geographically and phylogenetically dispersed marine sponges. The large diversity and low abundance of PRMPs in sponge metabolomes precludes isolation and structure elucidation of each individual PRMP congener. Here, using standards developed via biomimetic enzymatic synthesis of PRMPs, a mass spectrometry&#8208;based workflow to sequence PRMPs was developed and validated to reveal that the diversity of PRMPs in marine sponges is much greater than that has been realized by natural product isolation&#8208;based strategies. Findings are placed in the context of diversity&#8208;oriented transamidative macrocyclization of peptide substrates in sponge holobionts.

         <title>Stacked Thiazole Orange Dyes in DNA Capable of Switching Emissive Behavior in Response to Structural Transitions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;color fluorescent nucleic acids: Nucleic acids possessing multiple thiazole orange (TO) dyes were synthesized and their fluorescent behavior was investigated. The TO&#8208;conjugated DNA showed a spectral change from the typical monomer emission to the excimer&#8208;type red&#8208;shifted emission, which were dependent upon both the state of the DNA structure (single&#8208; or double&#8208;stranded DNA) and the arrangement of the TO dyes.







Abstract
Functional nucleic acids with the capability of generating fluorescence in response to hybridization events, microenvironment or structural changes are valuable as structural probes and chemical sensors. We now demonstrate the enzyme&#8208;assisted preparation of nucleic acids possessing multiple thiazole orange (TO) dyes and their fluorescent behavior, that show a spectral change from the typical monomer emission to the excimer&#8208;type red&#8208;shifted emission. We found that the fluorescent response and emission wavelength of the TO dyes were dependent on both the state of the DNA structure (single&#8208; or double&#8208;stranded DNA) and the arrangement of the TO dyes. We showed that the fluorescent behavior of the TO dyes can be applied for the detection of RNA molecules, suggesting that our approach for preparing the fluorescent nucleic acids functionalized with multiple TO dyes could be useful to design a fluorescence bioimaging and detection technique of biomolecules.

         <title>The Innate Immune Glycoprotein Lactoferrin Represses the Helicobacter pylori cag Type IV Secretion System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helicobacter pylori infection results in enhanced host production of lactoferrin which participates in nutritional immunity and can also serve as a source of nutrient iron for this pathogen, which can repress a major oncogenic virulence factor, the cag T4SS.







Abstract
Chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori increases risk of gastric diseases including gastric cancer. Despite development of a robust immune response, H.&#8197;pylori persists in the gastric niche. Progression of gastric inflammation to serious disease outcomes is associated with infection with H.&#8197;pylori strains which encode the cag Type&#8197;IV Secretion System (cag&#8197;T4SS). The cag T4SS is responsible for translocating the oncogenic protein CagA into host cells and inducing pro&#8208;inflammatory and carcinogenic signaling cascades. Our previous work demonstrated that nutrient iron modulates the activity of the T4SS and biogenesis of T4SS pili. In response to H.&#8197;pylori infection, the host produces a variety of antimicrobial molecules, including the iron&#8208;binding glycoprotein, lactoferrin. Our work shows that apo&#8208;lactoferrin exerts antimicrobial activity against H.&#8197;pylori under iron&#8208;limited conditions, while holo&#8208;lactoferrin enhances bacterial growth. Culturing H.&#8197;pylori in the presence of holo&#8208;lactoferrin prior to co&#8208;culture with gastric epithelial cells, results in repression of the cag&#8197;T4SS activity. Concomitantly, a decrease in biogenesis of cag&#8197;T4SS pili at the host&#8208;pathogen interface was observed under these culture conditions by high&#8208;resolution electron microscopy analyses. Taken together, these results indicate that acquisition of alternate sources of nutrient iron plays a role in regulating the pro&#8208;inflammatory activity of a bacterial secretion system and present novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of H.&#8197;pylori&#8208;related disease.

         <title>Protein Domain Specific Covalent Inhibition of Human DNA Polymerase &#946;</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single synthesis and screening strategy yields covalent inhibitors that inactivate bifunctional DNA polymerase &#946; by modifying lysine residues in different active site domains and prevent DNA binding.







Abstract
DNA polymerase &#946; (Pol &#946;) is a frequently overexpressed and/or mutated bifunctional repair enzyme. Pol &#946; possesses polymerase and lyase active sites, that are employed in two steps of base excision repair. Pol &#946; is an attractive therapeutic target for which there is a need for inhibitors. Two mechanistically inspired covalent inhibitors (1, IC50=21.0&#8197;&#956;M; 9, IC50=18.7&#8197;&#956;M) that modify lysine residues in different Pol &#946; active sites are characterized. Despite modifying lysine residues in different active sites, 1 and 9 inactivate the polymerase and lyase activities of Pol &#946;. Fluorescence anisotropy experiments indicate that they do so by preventing DNA binding. Inhibitors 1 and 9 provide the basis for a general approach to preparing domain selective inhibitors of bifunctional polymerases. Such molecules could prove to be useful tools for studying the role of wild type and mutant forms of Pol &#946; and other polymerases in DNA repair.

         <title>Discovery of the Class I Antimicrobial Lasso Peptide Arcumycin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lasso peptides are a family of natural products that have shown potent antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. Using a targeted genome mining approach, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of Actinobacteria&#8208;produced antimicrobial lasso peptides. We validated this approach with the isolation, structural validation, and investigation of bioactivity of a novel class&#8197;I lasso peptide arcumycin.







Abstract
Lasso peptides are a structurally diverse superfamily of conformationally constrained peptide natural products, of which a subset exhibits broad antimicrobial activity. Although advances in bioinformatics have increased our knowledge of strains harboring the biosynthetic machinery for lasso peptide production, relating peptide sequence to bioactivity remains a continuous challenge. To this end, genome mining investigation of Actinobacteria&#8208;produced antimicrobial lasso peptides was performed to correlate predicted structure with antibiotic activity. Bioinformatic evaluation revealed eight putative novel class I lasso peptide sequences. Fermentation of one of these hits, Streptomyces NRRL F&#8208;5639, resulted in the production of a novel class I lasso peptide, arcumycin. Arcumycin exhibited antibiotic activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria including Bacillus subtilis (4&#8197;&#956;g/mL), Staphylococcus aureus (8&#8197;&#956;g/mL), and Micrococcus luteus (8&#8197;&#956;g/mL). Arcumycin treatment of B. subtilis liaI&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal promoter fusion reporter strain resulted in upregulation of the liaRS system by the promoter liaI, indicating arcumycin interferes with lipid&#8197;II biosynthesis. Cumulatively, the results illustrate the relationship between phylogenetically related lasso peptides and their bioactivity as validated through the isolation, structural determination, and evaluation of bioactivity of the novel class&#8197;I antimicrobial lasso peptide arcumycin.

         <title>Multimodal Molecular Imaging and Identification of Bacterial Toxins Causing Mushroom Soft Rot and Cavity Disease</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Soft rot disease of edible mushrooms leads to rapid degeneration of fungal tissue and thus severely affects farming productivity worldwide. The bacterial mushroom pathogen Burkholderia gladioli pv. agaricicola has been identified as the cause. Yet, little is known about the molecular basis, the spatial distribution and the biological role of antifungal agents and toxins involved in this infectious disease. We combine genome mining, metabolic profiling, MALDI&#8208;Imaging and UV Raman spectroscopy, to detect, identify and visualize a complex of chemical mediators and toxins produced by the pathogen during the infection process, including toxoflavin, caryoynencin, and sinapigladioside. Furthermore, targeted gene knockouts and in vitro assays link antifungal agents to prevalent symptoms of soft rot, mushroom browning, and impaired mycelium growth. Comparisons of related pathogenic, mutualistic and environmental Burkholderia spp. indicate that the arsenal of antifungal agents may have paved the way for ancestral bacteria to colonize niches where frequent, antagonistic interactions with fungi occur. Our findings not only demonstrate the power of label&#8208;free, in vivo detection of polyyne virulence factors by Raman imaging, but may also inspire new approaches to disease control.</dc:description>

         <title>Preliminary Structural Data Revealed That the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 B.1.617 Variant's RBD Binds to ACE2 Receptor Stronger Than the Wild Type to Enhance the Infectivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural and biomolecular simulation techniques were used in this study to explore the impact of specific mutations in the B.1.617 variant of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 on the binding of receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) to the host receptor ACE2. The analysis revealed that the B.1.617 variant possesses different dynamic behaviours by altering dynamic stability, residual flexibility, and structural compactness.







Abstract
The evolution of new SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants around the globe has made the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic more worrisome, further pressuring the health care system and immunity. Novel variations that are unique to the receptor&#8208;binding motif (RBM) of the receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) spike glycoprotein, i.&#8201;e. L452R&#8208;E484Q, may play a different role in the B.1.617 (also known as G/452R.V3) variant's pathogenicity and better survival compared to the wild type. Therefore, a thorough analysis is needed to understand the impact of these mutations on binding with host receptor (RBD) and to guide new therapeutics development. In this study, we used structural and biomolecular simulation techniques to explore the impact of specific mutations (L452R&#8208;E484Q) in the B.1.617 variant on the binding of RBD to the host receptor ACE2. Our analysis revealed that the B.1.617 variant possesses different dynamic behaviours by altering dynamic&#8208;stability, residual flexibility and structural compactness. Moreover, the new variant had altered the bonding network and structural&#8208;dynamics properties significantly. MM/GBSA technique was used, which further established the binding differences between the wild type and B.1.617 variant. In conclusion, this study provides a strong impetus to develop novel drugs against the new SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants.

Porphyrin&#8208;protein conjugates: We present a method for the conjugation between alkyne&#8208;functionalized BSA and HSA with a cationic azido&#8208;metalloporphyrin that yields conjugates that possess photodynamic activity when evaluated against human Caucasian colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT&#8208;29). Their natural fluorescent properties allow for determination of cellular uptake in&#8197;vitro via fluorescence microscopy thus highlighting their potential theranostic applications.







Abstract
In this study, we present a convenient method for the labelling of tyrosine residues on bovine serum albumin (BSA) and human serum albumin (HSA) and report for the first time their subsequent bio&#8208;orthogonal conjugation with porphyrins via &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry. We demonstrate that these serum proteins can be labelled with an alkyne&#8208;diazonium heterobifunctional linker and can then undergo chemo&#8208;selective bio&#8208;orthogonal conjugation with a water&#8208;soluble azido metalloporphyrin via &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry to yield protein&#8208;conjugates that retain their photodynamic properties. In our hands, this method was found to be highly reproducible, scalable, and tuneable which allows for the production of bioconjugates where the porphyrin&#8208;protein conjugate not only retains an ability to generate singlet oxygen but possess an enhanced relative singlet oxygen quantum yields relative to the porphyrin alone. Furthermore, we have investigated the photochemical properties of these conjugates through photospectrometric techniques and have determined that the porphyrin macrocycles remain appreciably photostable under light irradiation. Our phototoxic protein&#8208;photosensitizer&#8208;conjugates show excellent photodynamic activity against a human colorectal adenocarcinoma cancer cell line (HT&#8208;29) with cell viabilities of 7.7&#177;0.5&#8201;% (IC50 8.76&#177;2.14&#8197;&#956;M) and 1.7&#177;1.9&#8201;% (IC50 8.48&#177;5.11&#8197;&#956;M) for BSA and HAS, respectively, when irradiated with 20&#8197;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of white&#8208;light. Importantly, neither of the conjugates was found to possess any significant &#8220;dark&#8221; toxicity even at concentrations of 100&#8197;&#956;M. Furthermore, the natural fluorescent properties of the bioconjugates allowed for the determination of cellular uptake in&#8197;vitro via fluorescence microscopy thus highlighting the potential theranostic applications of these unique protein&#8208;drug&#8208;conjugates.

         <title>DNAzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Cellular Oxidative Stress Amplification for Pro&#8208;protein Activation in Living Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intracellular delivery of catalase DNAzyme can potentiate the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in living cells to activate a ROS&#8208;responsive pro&#8208;protein (RNase A&#8208;NBC) for enhanced therapeutic efficacy and potential cancer treatment.







Abstract
The conditional control of protein function in response to the physiological change of cells is of great interest for studying protein function in biological settings and developing protein therapeutics. We report herein that catalase (CAT) DNAzyme can potentiate the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in living cells by knocking down catalase expression, which could further activate a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive pro&#8208;protein, RNase A&#8208;NBC, in&#8197;situ. Using an optimized lipid nanoparticle delivery system to simultaneously introduce CAT DNAzyme and RNase A&#8208;NBC into cells, we show that the pro&#8208;protein, RNase A&#8208;NBC, could be activated in a significantly enhanced manner to prohibit tumor cell growth in different types of cancer cells. We believe the methodology of regulating pro&#8208;protein activity using DNAzyme biocatalysis to differentiate intracellular environment could further be extended to other functional proteins, and even fundamental investigations in living systems to develop pro&#8208;protein therapeutics.

         <title>Multicomponent Bioluminescence Imaging with Naphthylamino Luciferins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naphthylamino luciferins were used for rapid, multi&#8208;component bioluminescent imaging. The analogues were synthesized using a modular route, and activities were measured in&#8197;vitro and in cellulo. Mutant luciferases were identified that could differentiate the substrates, and the unique enzyme&#8208;substrate pairs were compatible with existing bioluminescent probes. These substrates add to the growing set of bioluminescent tools for multiplexed imaging.







Abstract
Bioluminescent tools have been used for decades to image processes in complex tissues and preclinical models. However, few distinct probes are available to probe multicellular interactions. We and others are addressing this limitation by engineering new luciferases that can selectively process synthetic luciferin analogues. In this work, we explored naphthylamino luciferins as orthogonal bioluminescent probes. Three analogues were prepared using an optimized synthetic route. The luciferins were found to be robust emitters with native luciferase in&#8197;vitro and in cellulo. We further screened the analogues against libraries of luciferase mutants to identify unique enzyme&#8208;substrate pairs. The new probes can be used in conjunction with existing bioluminescent tools for multi&#8208;component imaging.

         <title>Carbon Monoxide is an Inhibitor of HIF Prolyl Hydroxylase Domain 2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an endogenously produced gasotransmitter that is involved in a range of physiological roles including the stabilisation of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor (HIF), a transcription factor that regulates oxygen homeostasis. Herein, by using CO&#8208;releasing molecule&#8208;2 as a CO donor, we show that CO is an inhibitor of HIF PHD2, one of the most important oxygen sensing enzymes in humans that regulates HIF stability at the protein level.







Abstract
Hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase domain 2 (PHD2) is an important oxygen sensor in animals. By using the CO&#8208;releasing molecule&#8208;2 (CORM&#8208;2) as an in&#8197;situ CO donor, we demonstrate that CO is an inhibitor of PHD2. This report provides further evidence about the emerging role of CO in oxygen sensing and homeostasis.

         <title>Simple Plug&#8208;In Synthetic Step for the Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Camphor from Renewable Starting Materials</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(&#8722;)&#8208;Camphor can occur naturally as a constituent of essential oils of several plants, including Cinnamomum camphora, or it can be obtained chemically from optically pure &#945;&#8208;pinene, which itself must be isolated from plants. Camphor is well known for its characteristic pungent odor and health benefits. While (+)&#8208;camphor can be isolated from various natural sources, (&#8722;)&#8208;camphor is more difficult to obtain. In our work, we demonstrate facile enantioselective kinetic resolution of renewable isobornyl esters for the synthesis of the valuable (&#8722;)&#8208;camphor.

         <title>Methemoglobin&#8208;Albumin Cluster Incorporating Protoporphyrin IX: Dual Functional Protein Drug for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8208;shell protein cluster comprising a methemoglobin (metHb) at the center and human serum albumin containing protoporphyrin IX (HSA&#8208;PPIX) at the periphery was synthesized as a unique photosensitizer with O2&#8208;generation property. The metHb&#8208;HSA3&#8208;PPIX2&#160;is protein drug showing dual task for photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
We describe the synthesis, photophysical properties, and photodynamic activity of a methemoglobin (metHb) wrapped covalently by human serum albumins (HSAs) incorporating protoporphyrin IX (PPIX): a metHb&#8208;HSA3&#8208;PPIX2 cluster. The metHb core catalyzes H2O2 disproportionation to generate O2 in tumor tissue. The HSA3&#8208;PPIX2 shell acts as a photosensitizer for 1O2 formation. The metHb&#8208;HSA3&#8208;PPIX2 cluster acts as a dual functional protein drug for photodynamic therapy.

     alt="Methemoglobin-Albumin Cluster Incorporating Protoporphyrin IX: Dual Functional Protein Drug for Photodynamic Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A core-shell&lt;/b&gt; protein cluster comprising a methemoglobin (metHb) at the center and human serum albumin containing protoporphyrin IX (HSA-PPIX) at the periphery was synthesized as a unique photosensitizer with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-generation property. The metHb-HSA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-PPIX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;is protein drug showing dual task for photodynamic therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe the synthesis, photophysical properties, and photodynamic activity of a methemoglobin (metHb) wrapped covalently by human serum albumins (HSAs) incorporating protoporphyrin IX (PPIX): a metHb-HSA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-PPIX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cluster. The metHb core catalyzes H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; disproportionation to generate O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in tumor tissue. The HSA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-PPIX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shell acts as a photosensitizer for &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formation. The metHb-HSA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-PPIX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cluster acts as a dual functional protein drug for photodynamic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) of Intracellular Transport by Means of Doubly Labelled siRNA Architectures</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
siRNA traffic lights: RNA is labelled at internal positions of the sequence by two different fluorescent dyes that undergo interstrand energy transfer. The emission is shifted to green after processing of siRNA into single stranded antisense RNA, potentially binding to target mRNA. This allowed imaging of siRNA by microscopy, using the fluorescence lifetime of the donor dye.







Abstract
For monitoring the intracellular pathway of small interfering RNA (siRNA), both strands were labelled at internal positions by two ATTO dyes as an interstrand F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer pair. siRNA double strands show red emission and a short donor lifetime as readout, whereas siRNA antisense single strands show green emission and a long donor lifetime. This readout signals if GFP silencing can be expected (green) or not (red). We attached both dyes to three structurally different alkyne anchors by postsynthetic modifications. There is only a slight preference for the ribofuranoside anchors with the dyes at their 2&#8217;&#8208;positions. For the first time, the delivery and fate of siRNA in live HeLa cells was tracked by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), which revealed a clear relationship between intracellular transport using different transfection methods and knockdown of GFP expression, which demonstrates the potential of our siRNA architectures as a tool for future development of effective siRNA.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Selenocysteine Incorporation into Proteins by Genetic Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Native Sec incorporation is highly species&#8208;dependent, which makes it challenging to express selenoproteins recombinantly. This article reviews recent progress in the method development for selenoprotein production, including the uses of engineered tRNA, allo&#8208;tRNA and Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element as well as genetic code expansion approaches for efficient site&#8208;specific Sec incorporation.







Abstract
Selenocysteine (Sec), a rare naturally proteinogenic amino acid, is the major form of essential trace element selenium in living organisms. Selenoproteins, with one or several Sec residues, are found in all three domains of life. Many selenoproteins play a role in critical cellular functions such as maintaining cell redox homeostasis. Sec is usually encoded by an in&#8208;frame stop codon UGA in the selenoprotein mRNA, and its incorporation in vivo is highly species&#8208;dependent and requires the reprogramming of translation. This mechanistic complexity of selenoprotein synthesis poses a big challenge to produce synthetic selenoproteins. To understand the functions of natural as well as engineered selenoproteins, many strategies have recently been developed to overcome the inherent barrier for recombinant selenoprotein production. In this review, we will describe the progress in selenoprotein production methodology.

         <title>Approaches to Introduce Helical Structure in Cysteine&#8208;Containing Peptides with a Bimane Group</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical structure can be introduced into short peptides, known to target Estrogen Receptor alpha, by macrocyclization with an inherently fluorescent bimane linker. Alternatively, a bimane&#8208;modification on a cysteine residue stabilises helicity in a tryptophan&#8208;containing, or to a lesser extent, a tyrosine&#8208;containing sequence.







Abstract
An i&#8722;i+4 or i&#8722;i+3 bimane&#8208;containing linker was introduced into a peptide known to target Estrogen Receptor alpha (ER&#945;), in order to stabilise an &#945;&#8208;helical geometry. These macrocycles were studied by CD and NMR to reveal the i&#8722;i+4 constrained peptide adopts a 310&#8208;helical structure in solution, and an &#945;&#8208;helical conformation on interaction with the ER&#945; coactivator recruitment surface in silico. An acyclic bimane&#8208;modified peptide is also helical, when it includes a tryptophan or tyrosine residue; but is significantly less helical with a phenylalanine or alanine residue, which indicates such a bimane modification influences peptide structure in a sequence dependent manner. The fluorescence intensity of the bimane appears influenced by peptide conformation, where helical peptides displayed a fluorescence increase when TFE was added to phosphate buffer, compared to a decrease for less helical peptides. This study presents the bimane as a useful modification to influence peptide structure as an acyclic peptide modification, or as a side&#8208;chain constraint to give a macrocycle.

         <title>Lessons in Organic Fluorescent Probe Discovery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent probes play fundamental roles in nearly all aspects of molecular science. This review provides an overview of the methods used to discover fluorescent natural products, beginning with classical synthetic approaches. Here, lessons are presented that provide modern examples for classical methods and identify new classics that chart novel avenues for probe discovery. The central focus of this work embodies an understanding of the fundamental properties that guide the development of fluorescent probes and the challenges within their design.







Abstract
Fluorescent probes have gained profound use in biotechnology, drug discovery, medical diagnostics, molecular and cell biology. The development of methods for the translation of fluorophores into fluorescent probes continues to be a robust field for medicinal chemists and chemical biologists, alike. Access to new experimental designs has enabled molecular diversification and led to the identification of new approaches to probe discovery. This review provides a synopsis of the recent lessons in modern fluorescent probe discovery.

         <title>Recent Advances in Bioactive Artificial Ionophores</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in synthetic ionophores are reviewed, with particular focus on potential biological activity. Offering contexts and insights into the molecular design, structure&#8208;activity relationships, this account sheds light on the diverse origins of cation/anion selectivity in synthetic ionophores.







Abstract
Several life&#8208;threatening diseases, also known as &#8216;Channelopathies&#8217; are linked to irregularities in ion transport proteins. Significant research efforts have fostered the development of artificial transport systems that facilitates to restore the functions of impaired natural transport proteins. Indeed, a few of these artificial ionophores demonstrate the rare combination of transmembrane ion transport and important biological activity, offering early promises of suitability in &#8216;channel replacement therapy&#8217;. In this review, structural facets and functions of both cationophores and anionophores are discussed. Ionophores that are toxic to various bacteria and yeast, could be exploited as antimicrobial agent. Nevertheless, few non&#8208;toxic ionophores offer the likelihood of treating a wide range of genetic diseases caused by the gene mutations. In addition, their ability to disrupt cellular homeostasis and to alter lysosomal pH endow ionophores as promising candidates for cancer treatment. Overall, critically outlining the advances in artificial ionophores in terms of in vitro ion transport, possible modes of action and biological activities enables us to propose possible future roadmaps in this research area.

         <title>Photothermal Responsive Singlet Oxygen Nanocarriers for Hypoxic Cancer Cell Ablation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hypoxia in the tumor cells has been demonstrated to restrict the outcomes of photodynamic therapy. Here, we designed photothermal responsive singlet oxygen nanocarriers, which bear the endoperoxide of 1,4&#8208;dimethylnaphthalene, to ablate cancer cells in&#8197;vitro. The unique O2&#8208;independent singlet oxygen&#8208;generation process suggests that the nanocarriers can be used as novel cancer phototherapy agents.







Abstract
Hypoxia in aggressively proliferating tumor cells has been demonstrated to restrict the efficiency of photodynamic therapy owing to its oxygen (O2)&#8208;dependent generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) from photosensitizers under light irradiation. To address this problem, we propose a small&#8208;molecule dye&#8208;based 1O2 capturing agent, B1. B1 not only bears a near&#8208;infrared absorbing azo&#8208;boron dipyrromethene backbone, but also has 1,4&#8208;dimethylnaphthalene, which facilitates the capture of 1O2 to form endoperoxide (B1&#8208;SO). B1&#8208;SO undergoes a reversible reaction via near&#8208;infrared photothermal stimulation, thus allowing 1O2 release. Based on this mechanism, stable B1&#8208;SO containing micelles (B1&#8208;SO NPs) were prepared and employed as 1O2 nanocarriers to ablate cancer cells in&#8197;vitro. Taking advantage of this O2&#8208;independent 1O2 releasing ability, B1&#8208;SO NPs were demonstrated to have efficient cytotoxicity under near&#8208;infrared irradiation, especially in a hypoxic environment. The unique O2&#8208;independent 1O2 generation process of B1&#8208;SO NPs suggests they can be used as novel cancer phototherapy agents.

         <title>Advances in Strategies and Tools Available for Interrogation of Protein O&#8208;GlcNAcylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New exciting strategies are being used to study and control O&#8208;linked &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAcylation) both in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro. In this minireview, an overview of recent advances in molecular tools being applied to the detection and identification of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation on cellular proteins as well as on individual proteins are provided.







Abstract
The attachment of a single O&#8208;linked &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAc) to serine and threonine residues of numerous proteins in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria is a reversible post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) and plays an important role as a regulator of various cellular processes in both healthy and disease states. Advances in strategies and tools that allow for the detection of dynamic O&#8208;GlcNAcylation on cellular proteins have helped to enhance our initial and ongoing understanding of its dynamic effects on cellular stimuli and given insights into its link to the pathogenesis of several chronic diseases. Furthermore, chemical genetic strategies and related tools have been successfully applied to a myriad of biological systems with a new level of spatiotemporal and molecular precision. These strategies have started to be used in studying and controlling O&#8208;GlcNAcylation both in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro. In this minireview, overviews of recent advances in molecular tools being applied to the detection and identification of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation on cellular proteins as well as on individual proteins are provided. In addition, chemical genetic strategies that have already been applied or are potentially usable in O&#8208;GlcNAc functional are also discussed.

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;Based Optical Ligands That Selectively Detect A&#946; Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular matchmaking: Ligands MK&#8208;6240 and b&#8208;TVBT2 are selective for aggregated tau in Alzheimer's disease (AD). When combining the azaindole moiety of MK&#8208;6240 with the methyl&#8208;bithiophene&#8208;carboxylate unit of b&#8208;TVBT2, the resulting ligand, termed HS&#8208;276, does not show binding to tau but instead high selectivity for A&#946; aggregates in AD brain tissue. By introducing small structural alterations of the HS&#8208;276 scaffold, the binding properties change.







Abstract
In several neurodegenerative diseases, the presence of aggregates of specific proteins in the brain is a significant pathological hallmark; thus, developing ligands able to bind to the aggregated proteins is essential for any effort related to imaging and therapeutics. Here we report the synthesis of thiophene&#8208;based ligands containing nitrogen heterocycles. The ligands selectively recognized amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) aggregates in brain tissue from individuals diagnosed neuropathologically as having Alzheimer's disease (AD). The selectivity for A&#946; was dependent on the position of nitrogen in the heterocyclic compounds, and the ability to bind A&#946; was shown to be reduced when introducing anionic substituents on the thiophene backbone. Our findings provide the structural and functional basis for the development of ligands that can differentiate between aggregated proteinaceous species comprised of distinct proteins. These ligands might also be powerful tools for studying the pathogenesis of A&#946; aggregation and for designing molecules for imaging of A&#946; pathology.

         <title>Genetic Incorporation of &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;Benzoyllysine by Engineering Methanomethylophilus alvus Pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA Synthetase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two Methanomethylophilus alvus PylRS mutants were engineered to genetically encode &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;benzoyllysine &#8208; a newly discovered histone post&#8208;translational modification &#8208; into proteins in E. coli and mammalian cells with high efficiency. Mutations at different locations in M. alvus PylRS active site (pink and yellow) were able to achieve high specificity for the same amino acid substrate (grey).







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications regulate protein structure and function. Lysine benzoylation is a newly discovered histone modification with unique physiological relevance. To construct proteins with this modification site&#8208;specifically, we generated orthogonal tRNAPyl&#8208;MaBzKRS pairs by engineering Methanomethylophilus alvus pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase, allowing the genetic incorporation of &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;benzoyllysine (BzK) into proteins with high efficiency in E. coli and mammalian cells. Two types of MaBzKRS were identified to incorporate BzK using mutations located at different positions of the amino acid binding pocket. These MaBzKRS are small in size and highly expressed, which will afford broad utilities in studying the biological effects of lysine benzoylation.

         <title>Protein Macrocyclization for Tertiary Structure Stabilization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein function is often tightly linked to a particular tertiary structure. For many protein applications it is required to stabilize the tertiary structure and prevent unfolding. Here, we summarize strategies that have been used to cyclize expressed proteins aiming for the stabilization of their native fold.







Abstract
Proteins possess unique molecular recognition capabilities and enzymatic activities, features that are usually tied to a particular tertiary structure. To make use of proteins for biotechnological and biomedical purposes, it is often required to enforce their tertiary structure in order to ensure sufficient stability under the conditions inherent to the application of interest. The introduction of intramolecular crosslinks has proven efficient in stabilizing native protein folds. Herein, we give an overview of methods that allow the macrocyclization of expressed proteins, discussing involved reaction mechanisms and structural implications.

         <title>Co&#8208;Oxidative Transformation of Piperine to Piperonal and 3,4&#8208;Methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde by a Lipoxygenase from Pleurotus sapidus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biotransformation of piperine, the pungent principle of black pepper (Piper nigrum), by the fungus Pleurotus sapidus resulted in the formation of two vanilla&#8208;like aroma compounds: The highly valuable piperonal, which is used for the aromatization of different sweets and dairy products, such as chocolate and ice cream, and 3,4&#8208;methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde. The conversion was identified as the result of a co&#8208;oxidative reaction catalyzed by a lipoxygenase of P. sapidus in the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids. More information can be found in the Communication by N.&#8208;K. Krahe et&#8197;al.

         <title>Design and Hybridization Properties of Acyclic Xeno Nucleic Acid Oligomers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acyclic xeno nucleic acid (XNA) oligomers with polyanion backbones generally suffer from high entropy cost upon duplex formation due to their flexible scaffold. However, recent studies have revealed that some acyclic XNAs can enable the formation of highly stable duplexes. This minireview summarizes hybridization properties of negatively charged acyclic XNA. Instead of cyclic nucleic acids, such acyclic XNAs have potential for use as novel biological tools. More information can be found in the Minireview by K. Murayama and H. Asanuma.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule FRET of Membrane Transport Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Membrane transporters are flexible proteins that cycle between structurally diverse conformations during transport. Yet, little is known about structural ensembles along transport paths, the transition speed between them, and particularly about the coupling between structures and transport. In this review the power of single&#8208;molecule FRET to answer some of these questions is highlighted and key studies on a broad variety of membranes transporters are discussed. More information can be found in the Review by H. Hofmann, C. L&#246;w et&#8197;al.

         <dc:description>
Understanding drugs&#8217; mechanism of action is integral to successful antimalarial drug development. Recent advances in chemoproteomic methods have created an avenue to globally profile drug targets in the Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria. Some of these strategies even allow direct measurement in living intracellular parasites. The cover feature highlights the achievement of probing the drug&#8211;protein interactome in an intact Plasmodium&#8208;infected erythrocyte. More information can be found in the review article by E.&#8197;R. Derbyshire et&#8197;al.

         <title>Synthetic Phosphoethanolamine Cellobiose Promotes Escherichia coli Biofilm Formation and Congo Red Binding</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Escherichia coli produces a phosphoethanolamine modified cellulose that is required for extracellular matrix assembly and biofilm scaffolds. A synthetic phosphoethanolamine cellobiose mimics the behavior of the naturally occurring polymer, inducing curli production and increasing biofilm formation. The discovery has implications for understanding microbial biofilms and the generation of new cellulosic probes. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;A. Gaddy, S.&#8197;D. Townsend et&#8197;al.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme engineering for the synthesis of a cosmetic ingredient: The osmolyte 2&#8208;O&#8208;glucosylglycerol is widely applied as a bioactive moisturizing ingredient in cosmetics and personal&#8208;care products. It is produced on an industrial scale by exploiting the promiscuous transglycosylation activity of a sucrose phosphorylase, but the enzyme currently used suffers from poor thermostability. A homologous sucrose phosphorylase that is far more thermostable was engineered to drastically improve its catalytic performance for the synthesis of 2&#8208;O&#8208;glucosylglycerol, enabling the production of this compound at elevated temperatures.

         <title>Strategies for Covalent Labeling of Long RNAs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decorating long RNAs: This review discusses currently available approaches for the introduction of reporter groups into large RNA molecules at internal positions in a site&#8208;specific fashion to allow visualization, tracking and structural investigations on long RNAs.







Abstract
The introduction of chemical modifications into long RNA molecules at specific positions for visualization, biophysical investigations, diagnostic and therapeutic applications still remains challenging. In this review, we present recent approaches for covalent internal labeling of long RNAs. Topics included are the assembly of large modified RNAs via enzymatic ligation of short synthetic oligonucleotides and synthetic biology approaches preparing site&#8208;specifically modified RNAs via in&#8197;vitro transcription using an expanded genetic alphabet. Moreover, recent approaches to employ deoxyribozymes (DNAzymes) and ribozymes for RNA labeling and RNA methyltransferase based labeling strategies are presented. We discuss the potentials and limits of the individual methods, their applicability for RNAs with several hundred to thousands of nucleotides in length and indicate future directions in the field.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time and Label&#8208;Free Measurement of Deubiquitinase Activity with a MspA Nanopore</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MspA nanopore is demonstrated as a sensor for discriminating and quantifying various ubiquitin proteins. Real&#8208;time measurement of polymeric ubiquitin chain disassembly by a deubiquitinating enzyme was performed and enzyme kinetics were determined.







Abstract
Covalently attaching ubiquitin (Ub) to cellular proteins as a post&#8208;translational modification can result in altered function of modified proteins. Enzymes regulating Ub as a post&#8208;translational modification, such as ligases and deubiquitinases, are challenging to characterize in part due to the low throughput of in&#8208;vitro assays. Single&#8208;molecule nanopore based assays have the advantage of detecting proteins with high specificity and resolution, and in a label&#8208;free, real&#8208;time fashion. Here we demonstrate the use of a MspA nanopore for discriminating and quantifying Ub proteins. We further applied the MspA pore to measure the Ub&#8208;chain disassembly activity of UCH37, a proteasome associated deubiquitinase. The implementation of this MspA system into nanopore arrays could enable high throughput characterizations of unknown deubiquitinases as well as drug screening against disease related enzymes.

         <title>Simple Plug&#8208;In Synthetic Step for the Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Camphor from Renewable Starting Materials</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymes are a valuable tool for upcycling side&#8208;stream from renewable sources. We have found that EstB from Burkholderia gladioli could achieve high enantiopurity in upcycling &#945;&#8208;pinene, a side&#8208;product from turpentine production, whereas common lipases and esterases could not. This reaction can be easily integrated with the existing chemical synthetic route for the production of the racemic camphor with minimal adjustments as the route goes through an intermediate isobornyl acetate.







Abstract
Racemic camphor and isoborneol are readily available as industrial side products, whereas (1R)&#8208;camphor is available from natural sources. Optically pure (1S)&#8208;camphor, however, is much more difficult to obtain. The synthesis of racemic camphor from &#945;&#8208;pinene proceeds via an intermediary racemic isobornyl ester, which is then hydrolyzed and oxidized to give camphor. We reasoned that enantioselective hydrolysis of isobornyl esters would give facile access to optically pure isoborneol and camphor isomers, respectively. While screening of a set of commercial lipases and esterases in the kinetic resolution of racemic monoterpenols did not lead to the identification of any enantioselective enzymes, the cephalosporin Esterase B from Burkholderia gladioli (EstB) and Esterase C (EstC) from Rhodococcus rhodochrous showed outstanding enantioselectivity (E&gt;100) towards the butyryl esters of isoborneol, borneol and fenchol. The enantioselectivity was higher with increasing chain length of the acyl moiety of the substrate. The kinetic resolution of isobornyl butyrate can be easily integrated into the production of camphor from &#945;&#8208;pinene and thus allows the facile synthesis of optically pure monoterpenols from a renewable side&#8208;product.

         <title>A Yeast Chronological Lifespan Assay to Assess Activity of Proteasome Stimulators</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chronological lifespan (CLS) assay using various strains of yeast to monitor the effect of proteasome stimulation with small molecules is described.







Abstract
Aging is characterized by changes in several cellular processes, including dysregulation of proteostasis. Current research has shown long&#8208;lived rodents display elevated proteasome activity throughout life and proteasome dysfunction is linked to shorter lifespans in a transgenic mouse model. The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is one of the main pathways leading to cellular protein clearance and quality maintenance. Reduction in proteasome activity is associated with aging and its related pathologies. Small molecule stimulators of the proteasome have been proposed to help alleviate cellular stress related to unwanted protein accumulation. Here we have described the development of techniques to monitor the impact of proteasome stimulation in wild&#8208;type yeast and a strain that has impaired proteasome expression. We validated our chronological lifespan assay using both types of yeast with a variety of small molecule stimulators at different concentrations. By modifying the media conditions for the yeast, molecules can be evaluated for their potential to increase chronological lifespan in five days. Additionally, our assay conditions can be used to monitor the activity of proteasome stimulators in modulating the degradation of a YFP&#8208;&#945;&#8208;synuclein fusion protein produced by yeast. We anticipate these methods to be valuable for those wishing to study the impact of increasing proteasome&#8208;mediated degradation of proteins in a eukaryotic model organism.

         <title>&#945;V&#946;6 Integrin: An Intriguing Target for COVID&#8208;19 and Related Diseases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An emerging tool against the pandemic war: Thanks to the identification of the RGD sequence on the spike protein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, RGD&#8208;recognizing integrins have recently received important attention. Among them, &#945;V&#946;6 may be an intriguing target not only for the inhibition of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 entry, but also for the diagnosis/treatment of COVID&#8208;19 related fibrosis.







Abstract
The outbreak of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 has been an extraordinary event that constituted a global health emergency. As the novel coronavirus is continuing to spread over the world, the need for therapeutic agents to control this pandemic is increasing. &#945;V&#946;6 Integrin may be an intriguing target not only for the inhibition of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 entry, but also for the diagnosis/treatment of COVID&#8208;19 related fibrosis, an emerging type of fibrotic disease which will probably affect a significant part of the recovered patients. In this short article, the possible role of this integrin for fighting COVID&#8208;19 is discussed on the basis of recently published evidence, showing how its underestimated involvement may be interesting for the development of novel pharmacological tools.

         <title>Metal Complexes as Antiviral Agents for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal complexes for COVID&#8208;19&#8201;targets: SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 has caused a global pandemic that has affected millions of people worldwide. Herein, metal complexes that have been reported to inhibit various SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 enzymes and their proposed mechanism of action are discussed.







Abstract
The severe acute respiratory syndrome &#8211; coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), the infectious agent responsible for COVID&#8208;19 &#8211; has caused more than 2.5 million deaths worldwide and triggered a global pandemic. Even with successful vaccines being delivered, there is an urgent need for novel treatments to combat SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, and other emerging viral diseases. While several organic small molecule drug candidates are in development, some effort has also been devoted towards the application of metal complexes as potential antiviral agents against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Herein, the metal complexes that have been reported to show antiviral activity against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 or one of its target proteins are described and their proposed mechanisms of action are discussed.

         <title>Substrate Protection in Controlled Enzymatic Transformation of Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly specific enzymes make protecting groups unnecessary in biology but some enzymes including proteases and kinases have multiple biological substrates and there is strong interest to stop a specific enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reaction without inhibiting the enzyme itself. Recent developments in peptide&#8208;imprinted nanoparticles allow precise protection of peptide substrates and open up previously impossible ways to manipulate enzymatic reactions.







Abstract
Proteins are involved in practically every single biological process. The many enzymes involved in their synthesis, cleavage, and posttranslational modification (PTM) carry out highly specific tasks with no usage of protecting groups. Yet, the chemists&#8217; strategy of protection/deprotection potentially can be highly useful, for example, when a specific biochemical reaction catalyzed by a broad&#8208;specificity enzyme needs to be inhibited, during infection of cells by enveloped viruses, in the invasion and spread of cancer cells, and upon mechanistic investigation of signal&#8208;transduction pathways. Doing so requires highly specific binding of peptide substrates in aqueous solution with biologically competitive affinities. Recent development of peptide&#8208;imprinted cross&#8208;linked micelles allows such protection and affords previously impossible ways of manipulating peptides and proteins in enzymatic transformations.

         <title>From Natural Methylation to Versatile Alkylations Using Halide Methyltransferases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The evolution of promiscuous halide methyltransferases enables the enzymatic synthesis of S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine analogues from alkyl iodides and S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;homocysteine. This facilitates the synthesis of analogues with alkyl groups larger than methyl groups, which can readily be used by methyltransferases. These processes provide access to diverse alkylated products with altered bioactivities, expanding the synthetic potential of methyltransferases. We expect a toolbox of protein&#8208;engineered halide methyltransferase variants to pave the way towards versatile chemo&#8208; and regioselective biocatalytic alkylations.

         <title>Chemoproteomics for Plasmodium Parasite Drug Target Discovery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoproteomics adapted to Plasmodium parasites enable proteome&#8208;wide assessment of drug&#8208;protein interactions. These methods assist in target deconvolution of novel antimalarial compounds, commonly discovered in phenotypic screens, that have unknown mechanisms of action. In this review, we detail current methods of label&#8208;based and energetics&#8208;based chemoproteomics and their application for Plasmodium parasite drug target discovery.







Abstract
Emerging Plasmodium parasite drug resistance is threatening progress towards malaria control and elimination. While recent efforts in cell&#8208;based, high&#8208;throughput drug screening have produced first&#8208;in&#8208;class drugs with promising activities against different Plasmodium life cycle stages, most of these antimalarial agents have elusive mechanisms of action. Though challenging to address, target identification can provide valuable information to facilitate lead optimization and preclinical drug prioritization. Recently, proteome&#8208;wide methods for direct assessment of drug&#8208;protein interactions have emerged as powerful tools in a number of systems, including Plasmodium. In this review, we will discuss current chemoproteomic strategies that have been adapted to antimalarial drug target discovery, including affinity&#8208; and activity&#8208;based protein profiling and the energetics&#8208;based techniques thermal proteome profiling and stability of proteins from rates of oxidation. The successful application of chemoproteomics to the Plasmodium blood stage highlights the potential of these methods to link inhibitors to their molecular targets in more elusive Plasmodium life stages and intracellular pathogens in the future.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Small Molecule Labeling of an Internal Loop in JC Polyomavirus Pentamers Using the &#960;&#8208;Clamp&#8208;Mediated Cysteine Conjugation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This communication advances the recently developed &#960;&#8208;clamp&#8208;(Phe&#8208;Cys&#8208;Pro&#8208;Phe)&#8208;mediated cysteine conjugation for fluorescent labeling of JC Polyomavirus (JCPyV) pentamers. We show a concise (two steps) synthesis of a small molecule &#960;&#8208;clamp reactive probe that is easily tunable for a broad set of fluorescent reporters, solubility, and fluorophore distance from the modification site. With this probe we demonstrate labeling in a structured loop region of a protein and visualize cellular entry of JCPyV viral particles.







Abstract
The major capsid protein VP1 of JC Polyomavirus assembles into pentamers that serve as a model for studying viral entry of this potentially severe human pathogen. Previously, labeling of viral proteins utilized large fusion proteins or non&#8208;specific amine&#8208; or cysteine&#8208;functionalization with fluorescent dyes. Imaging of these sterically hindered fusion proteins or heterogeneously labeled virions limits reproducibility and could prevent the detection of subtle trafficking phenomena. Here we advance the &#960;&#8208;clamp&#8208;mediated cysteine conjugation for site&#8208;selective fluorescent labeling of VP1&#8208;pentamers. We demonstrate a one&#8208;step synthesis of a probe consisting of a bio&#8208;orthogonal click chemistry handle bridged to a perfluoro&#8208;biphenyl &#960;&#8208;clamp reactive electrophile by a polyethylene glycol linker. We expand the scope of the &#960;&#8208;clamp conjugation by demonstrating selective labeling of an internal, surface exposed loop in VP1. Thus, the &#960;&#8208;clamp conjugation offers a general method to selectively bioconjugate tags&#8208;of&#8208;interest to viral proteins without impeding their ability to bind and enter cells.

         <title>Co&#8208;Oxidative Transformation of Piperine to Piperonal and 3,4&#8208;Methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde by a Lipoxygenase from Pleurotus sapidus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biotransformation of piperine to piperonal and 3,4&#8208;methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde: A lipoxygenase from Pleurotus sapidus (LOXPsa1) was identified, which generated the highly valuable, vanilla&#8208;like aroma compound piperonal through co&#8208;oxidation of piperine, the pungent principle of black pepper, in the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids. In addition, 3,4&#8208;methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde, which also presents a vanilla&#8208;like odor, was produced as second product.







Abstract
The valuable aroma compound piperonal with its vanilla&#8208;like olfactory properties is of high interest for the fragrance and flavor industry. A lipoxygenase (LOXPsa1) of the basidiomycete Pleurotus sapidus was identified to convert piperine, the abundant pungent principle of black pepper (Piper nigrum), to piperonal and a second volatile product, 3,4&#8208;methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde, with a vanilla&#8208;like odor through an alkene cleavage. The reaction principle was co&#8208;oxidation, as proven by its dependence on the presence of linoleic or &#945;&#8208;linolenic acid, common substrates of lipoxygenases. Optimization of the reaction conditions (substrate concentrations, reaction temperature and time) led to a 24&#8208;fold and 15&#8208;fold increase of the piperonal and 3,4&#8208;methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde concentration using the recombinant enzyme. Monokaryotic strains showed different concentrations of and ratios between the two reaction products.

         <title>Design and Hybridization Properties of Acyclic Xeno Nucleic Acid Oligomers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligomers composed of various acyclic xeno nucleic acids (XNAs) have been designed. This minireview highlights the design of acyclic XNA scaffolds with polyanion backbone and hybridization properties of acyclic XNA oligomers. Thermal stabilities of such acyclic XNA duplexes strongly depend on the structure of the scaffold.







Abstract
Xeno nucleic acids (XNAs) are analogues of DNA and RNA that have a non&#8208;ribose artificial scaffold. XNAs are possible prebiotic genetic carriers as well as alternative genetic systems in artificial life. In addition, XNA oligomers can be used as biological tools. Acyclic XNAs, which do not have cyclic scaffolds, are attractive due to facile their synthesis and remarkably high nuclease resistance. To maximize the performance of XNAs, a negatively charged backbone is preferable to provide sufficient water solubility; however, acyclic XNAs containing polyanionic backbones suffer from high entropy cost upon duplex formation, because of the high flexibility of the acyclic nature. Herein, we review the relationships between the structure and duplex hybridization properties of various acyclic XNA oligomers with polyanion backbones.

     alt="Design and Hybridization Properties of Acyclic Xeno Nucleic Acid Oligomers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oligomers composed&lt;/b&gt; of various acyclic xeno nucleic acids (XNAs) have been designed. This minireview highlights the design of acyclic XNA scaffolds with polyanion backbone and hybridization properties of acyclic XNA oligomers. Thermal stabilities of such acyclic XNA duplexes strongly depend on the structure of the scaffold.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xeno nucleic acids (XNAs) are analogues of DNA and RNA that have a non-ribose artificial scaffold. XNAs are possible prebiotic genetic carriers as well as alternative genetic systems in artificial life. In addition, XNA oligomers can be used as biological tools. Acyclic XNAs, which do not have cyclic scaffolds, are attractive due to facile their synthesis and remarkably high nuclease resistance. To maximize the performance of XNAs, a negatively charged backbone is preferable to provide sufficient water solubility; however, acyclic XNAs containing polyanionic backbones suffer from high entropy cost upon duplex formation, because of the high flexibility of the acyclic nature. Herein, we review the relationships between the structure and duplex hybridization properties of various acyclic XNA oligomers with polyanion backbones.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Engineering of a Thermostable Biocatalyst for the Synthesis of 2&#8208;O&#8208;Glucosylglycerol</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Osmolyte synthesis at elevated temperatures: 2&#8208;O&#8208;Glucosylglycerol is produced on industrial scale using the promiscuous transglycosylation activity of sucrose phosphorylase. We engineered the catalytic efficiency and regioselectivity of a sucrose phosphorylase that is far more thermostable than the one currently used in industry.







Abstract
2&#8208;O&#8208;Glucosylglycerol is accumulated by various bacteria and plants in response to environmental stress. It is widely applied as a bioactive moisturising ingredient in skin care products, for which it is manufactured via enzymatic glucosylation of glycerol by the sucrose phosphorylase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides. This industrial process is operated at room temperature due to the mediocre stability of the biocatalyst, often leading to microbial contamination. The highly thermostable sucrose phosphorylase from Bifidobacterium adolescentis could be a better alternative in that regard, but this enzyme is not fit for production of 2&#8208;O&#8208;glucosylglycerol due to its low regioselectivity and poor affinity for glycerol. In this work, the thermostable phosphorylase was engineered to alleviate these problems. Several engineering approaches were explored, ranging from site&#8208;directed mutagenesis to conventional, binary, iterative or combinatorial randomisation of the active site, resulting in the screening of &#8764;3,900 variants. Variant P134Q displayed a 21&#8208;fold increase in catalytic efficiency for glycerol, as well as a threefold improvement in regioselectivity towards the 2&#8208;position of the substrate, while retaining its activity for several days at elevated temperatures.

         <title>Inhibitors of CA IX Enzyme Based on Polyhedral Boron Compounds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review covers several classes of inhibitors specific for carbonic anhydrase IX enzyme that emerged recently from a non&#8208;traditional concept. This is characterized by combination of space&#8208;filing inorganic (metalla)carborane cluster with sulfamide and sulfonamide binding motif for Zn2+ in the active site. The structural factors essential for attaining high activity and selectivity for the CA IX isoform are discussed. Results from preclinical studies show relevance of these compounds for development of anticancer drugs.







Abstract
This review describes recent progress in the design and development of inhibitors of human carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) based on space&#8208;filling carborane and cobalt bis(dicarbollide) clusters. CA IX enzyme is known to play a crucial role in cancer cell proliferation and metastases. The new class of potent and selective CA IX inhibitors combines the structural motif of a bulky inorganic cluster with an alkylsulfamido or alkylsulfonamido anchor group for Zn2+ ion in the enzyme active site. Detailed structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies of a large series containing 50 compounds uncovered structural features of the cluster&#8208;containing inhibitors that are important for efficient and selective inhibition of CA IX activity. Preclinical evaluation of selected compounds revealed low toxicity, favorable pharmacokinetics and ability to reduce tumor growth. Cluster&#8208;containing inhibitors of CA IX can thus be considered as promising candidates for drug development and/or for combination therapy in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT).

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule FRET of Membrane Transport Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent single&#8208;molecule FRET studies on members of various transporter families reveal the potential of this technique to advance the mechanistic understanding of this protein class.







Abstract
Uncovering the structure and function of biomolecules is a fundamental goal in structural biology. Membrane&#8208;embedded transport proteins are ubiquitous in all kingdoms of life. Despite structural flexibility, their mechanisms are typically studied by ensemble biochemical methods or by static high&#8208;resolution structures, which complicate a detailed understanding of their dynamics. Here, we review the recent progress of single molecule F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) in determining mechanisms and timescales of substrate transport across membranes. These studies do not only demonstrate the versatility and suitability of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art smFRET tools for studying membrane transport proteins but they also highlight the importance of membrane mimicking environments in preserving the function of these proteins. The current achievements advance our understanding of transport mechanisms and have the potential to facilitate future progress in drug design.

         <title>Electron Microscopy Imaging Applications of Room Temperature Ionic Liquids in the Biological Field: A Review</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic liquids for biological imaging: This work comprehensively reviews the use of ionic liquids for preparing hard&#8208;to&#8208;image, non&#8208;conductive, soft, and/or wet, biological materials for electron microscopy. Commonly used ionic liquids and their application to biomaterials for imaging are summarized to illicit sample&#8208;specific best practices. While the technique has risen in popularity and holds promise for several biological fields, key challenges must be solved to allow for its widespread adoption in microscopy.







Abstract
For biological imaging using electron microscopy (EM), the use of room&#8208;temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) has been proposed as an alternative to traditional lengthy preparation methods. With their low vapor pressures and conductivity, RTILs can be applied onto hard&#8208;to&#8208;image soft and/or wet samples without dehydration &#8211; allowing for a more representative, hydrated state of material and opening the possibility for visualization of in&#8197;situ physiological processes using conventional EM systems. However, RTILs have yet to be utilized to their full potential by microscopists and microbiologists alike. To this end, this review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of biological applications of RTILs for EM to bridge the RTIL, in&#8197;situ microscopy, and biological communities. We outline future research avenues for the use of RTILs for the EM observation of biological samples, notably i) RTIL selection and optimization, ii) applications for live cell processes and iii) electron beam and ionic liquid interaction studies.

         <title>From Natural Methylation to Versatile Alkylations Using Halide Methyltransferases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naturally occurring and engineered promiscuous halide methyltransferases (HMTs) enable S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine analogues to be enzymatically synthesised and recycled, using simple and readily available alkyl iodides as alkyl donors. In combination with promiscuous methyltransferases (MTs), they dramatically expand the bioalkylation toolbox.







Abstract
Halide methyltransferases (HMTs) enable the enzymatic synthesis of S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) from S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;homocysteine (SAH) and methyl iodide. Characterisation of a range of naturally occurring HMTs and subsequent protein engineering led to HMT variants capable of synthesising ethyl, propyl, and allyl analogues of SAM. Notably, HMTs do not depend on chemical synthesis of methionine analogues, as required by methionine adenosyltransferases (MATs). However, at the moment MATs have a much broader substrate scope than the HMTs. Herein we provide an overview of the discovery and engineering of promiscuous HMTs and how these strategies will pave the way towards a toolbox of HMT variants for versatile chemo&#8208; and regioselective biocatalytic alkylations.

&lt;p&gt;Halide methyltransferases (HMTs) enable the enzymatic synthesis of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-adenosyl-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-methionine (SAM) from &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-adenosyl-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-homocysteine (SAH) and methyl iodide. Characterisation of a range of naturally occurring HMTs and subsequent protein engineering led to HMT variants capable of synthesising ethyl, propyl, and allyl analogues of SAM. Notably, HMTs do not depend on chemical synthesis of methionine analogues, as required by methionine adenosyltransferases (MATs). However, at the moment MATs have a much broader substrate scope than the HMTs. Herein we provide an overview of the discovery and engineering of promiscuous HMTs and how these strategies will pave the way towards a toolbox of HMT variants for versatile chemo- and regioselective biocatalytic alkylations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthetic Phosphoethanolamine Cellobiose Promotes Escherichia coli Biofilm Formation and Congo Red Binding</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) cellobiose was synthesized and evaluated for its effects on E. coli biofilms . The impact of the synthetic disaccharide on biofilm formation was examined via colorimetric assays revealing an increase in cellular adhesion to an abiotic substrate. Congo red binding assays indicate that culturing E. coli in the presence of pEtN cellobiose enhances Congo red binding to bacterial cells. Lastly, single electron microscopy reveals the disaccharide increased the production of curli fibers.







Abstract
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused by bacteria growing in complex, multicellular enclosed aggregates known as biofilms. Recently, a zwitterionic cellulose derivative produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli) was determined to play an important role in the formation and assembly of biofilms. In order to produce a minimal, yet structurally defined tool compound to probe the biology of the naturally occurring polymer, we have synthesized a zwitterionic phosphoethanolamine cellobiose (pEtN cellobiose) and evaluated its biofilm activity in the gram&#8208;negative bacterium E. coli, a pathogen implicated in the pathogenesis of UTIs. The impact of synthetic pEtN cellobiose on biofilm formation was examined via colorimetric assays which revealed an increase in cellular adhesion to an abiotic substrate compared to untreated samples. Additionally, Congo red binding assays indicate that culturing E. coli in the presence of pEtN cellobiose enhances Congo Red binding to bacterial cells. These results reveal new opportunities to study the impact glycopolymers have on cellular adhesion in gram&#8208;negative pathogens.
