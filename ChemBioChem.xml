      <title>Use of copper as a trigger for in vivo activity of E. coli laccase CueO: A simple tool for biosynthetic purposes</title>
      <dc:description>Laccases belong to multi&#8208;copper oxidases that catalyze oxidation of various electron&#8208;rich substrates with concomitant reduction of molecular oxygen to water. The multicopper oxidase/laccase CueO of  Escherichia coli  is responsible for the oxidation of Cu1+  to less harmful Cu2+  in the periplasm. CueO possesses a relatively broad substrate spectrum as laccase, and its activity is enhanced by copper excess. The aim of this study was to trigger CueO activity  in vivo  for the use in biocatalysis. Herein, the addition of 5 mM CuSO  4  was proven effective in triggering CueO activity at need with minor toxic effects on  E. coli  cells. Cu&#8208;treated  E. coli  cells were able to convert several phenolic compounds to the corresponding dimers. Finally, the endogenous CueO activity was applied to a four steps cascade, in which coniferyl alcohol was converted to the valuable plant lignan (&#8208;)&#8208;matairesinol.</dc:description>

      <title>Comparison of Bioorthogonal &#946;&#8208;Lactone Activity&#8208;Based Probes for Selective Labeling of Penicillin&#8208;Binding Proteins</title>
      <dc:description>
Decision tree: The cover feature depicts the decision making process for designing bioorthogonal probes for activity&#8208;based protein profiling. Each &#8220;branch&#8221; presents its own complexities and considerations to produce a probe most appropriate for the given application. The development of selective, bioorthogonal activity&#8208;based probes for penicillin&#8208;binding proteins in Streptococcus pneumoniae highlights these concerns, with emphasis on linker length and environment in which the bioorthogonal reaction is applied.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Decision tree&lt;/b&gt;: The cover feature depicts the decision making process for designing bioorthogonal probes for activity&#8208;based protein profiling. Each &#8220;branch&#8221; presents its own complexities and considerations to produce a probe most appropriate for the given application. The development of selective, bioorthogonal activity&#8208;based probes for penicillin&#8208;binding proteins in &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; highlights these concerns, with emphasis on linker length and environment in which the bioorthogonal reaction is applied.

      <title>Discovery of Six Ramoplanin Family Gene Clusters and the Lipoglycodepsipeptide Chersinamycin</title>
      <dc:description>
Ramoplanins and enduracidins belong to a unique class of nonribosomal peptides with potent antimicrobial activity. Targeted genome mining showed that biosynthetic gene clusters for congeners have been hiding in plain sight within sequenced organisms known for producing other important antimicrobial natural products. The structure and gene cluster for the ramoplanin congener chersinamycin provide new opportunities for the development of this potent antimicrobial class.

      <title>Molecular Basis of the Antiangiogenic Action of Rosmarinic Acid, a Natural Compound Targeting Fibroblast Growth Factor&#8208;2/FGFR Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Less complex: Right: Fibroblast growth factor&#8208;2 (FGF2, orange) interacts with the extracellular domain of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR, red/blue) and induces the autophosphorylation of FGFR intracellular tyrosine kinase domain that, in turn, leads to complex signal transduction pathways regulating angiogenesis, tissue homeostasis, wound repair and cancer. Left: Rosmarinic acid (RA), a polyphenol present in Laminaceae family plants, binds to the extracellular domain of FGFR and induces dissociation of the FGF2/FGFR complex. NMR and docking approaches demonstrate that RA directly competes with FGF2 for the same binding site and induces allosteric perturbations further destabilizing the complex. Cellular studies show that RA binding inhibits FGF2&#8208;induced FGFR phosphorylation, a key step in FGFR signalling. More information can be found in the full paper by K. Pagano, L. Ragona et&#8197;al.

      <title>Activity&#8208;based profiling of bile salt hydrolysis in the human gut microbiome with beta&#8208;lactam or acrylamide&#8208;based probes</title>
      <dc:description>Microbial bile salt hydrolases (BSHs) found in the intestine catalyze the deconjugation of taurine&#8208; and glycine&#8208;linked bile salts produced in the liver. The resulting bile salts are biological detergents and are critical in aiding lipophilic nutrient digestion. Thereby, the activity of BSHs in the gut microbiome is directly linked to human metabolism and overall health. Bile salt metabolism has also been associated with disease phenotypes such as liver and colorectal cancer. In order to reshape the gut microbiome to optimize bile salt metabolism, tools to characterize and quantify these processes must exist to enable a much&#8208;improved understanding of how metabolism goes awry in the face of disease, and how it can be improved through an altered lifestyle and environment. Furthermore, it is necessary to attribute metabolic activity to specific members and BSHs within the microbiome. To this end, we have developed activity&#8208;based probes with two different reactive groups to target bile salt hydrolases. These probes bind similarly to the authentic bile salt substrates, and we demonstrate enzyme labeling of active bile salt hydrolases using purified protein, cell lysates, and in human stool.</dc:description>

      <title>Remote Water&#8208;Mediated Proton Transfer Triggers Inter&#8208;Cu Electron Transfer: Nitrite Reduction Activation in Copper&#8208;Containing Nitrite Reductase</title>
      <dc:description>The copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductase (CuNiR) catalyzes the biological conversion of nitrite to nitric oxide, in which the key long&#8208;range electron/proton transfers are involved in the catalysis. However, the details of the electron/proton transfer mechanism are still unknown. In particular, the driving force of the electron transfer from the type&#8208;1 copper (T1Cu) site to the type&#8208;2 copper (T2Cu) site is ambiguous. Here, we explored the two possible proton transfer channels by using two&#8208;layered ONIOM calculations, including the high&#8208;pH proton channel and the primary proton channel. Our calculation results reveal that the driving force for electron transfer from T1Cu to T2Cu comes from a remote water&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;proton transfer, which can be termed as a water&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer mechanism. In the high&#8208;pH proton channel, the water&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;proton transfer occurs from Glu113 to an intermediate water molecule, whereas in the primary channel the transfer is performed from Lys128 to His260. Subsequently, the two channels employ another two or three distinct proton transfer steps to deliver the proton to the nitrite substrate at the T2Cu site. These findings explain the detailed proton/electron transfer mechanisms of copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductase and may extend our understanding of the diverse proton&#8208;coupled ET mechanisms in complicated proteins.</dc:description>

      <title>Targeting the surface of the protein 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 by ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (1.5 nm), carrying the specific peptide CRaf</title>
      <dc:description>The surface of ultrasmall gold nanoparticles with an average diameter of 1.55 nm was conjugated with a 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 protein&#8208;binding peptide derived from CRaf. Each particle carries 18 CRaf peptides, leading to an overall stoichiometry of Au  &#187; 115  (CRaf)  18  . The binding to the protein 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 was probed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and fluorescence polarization spectroscopy (FP). The dissociation constant (  K  D  ) was measured as 5.0 &#181;M by ITC and 0.9 &#181;M by FP, which was close to the affinity of dissolved CRaf to 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 s . In contrast to dissolved CRaf which alone did not enter HeLa cells, CRAF&#8208;conjugated gold nanoparticles were well taken up by HeLa cells, opening the opportunity to target the protein inside a cell.</dc:description>

      <title>Efficient assay for the detection of hydrogen peroxide via estimation of the enzyme promiscuous activity in the perhydrolysis reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrogen peroxide is an ideal oxidant in the view of availability, atom&#8208;economy, or green aspects. Furthermore, it is produced by the cell mitochondria and plays a meaningful role in controlling the physiological processes, but unregulated production leads to the destruction of organs. Due to its diverse roles, a fast and selective method for hydrogen peroxide detection is the major limitation to prevent the negative effects caused by its excess. Therefore, we aimed to develop an efficient assay for the detection of H2O2. For this purpose, we combined the enzymatic method for the detection of hydrogen peroxide via the estimation of the promiscuity of various enzymes. We estimated the activity of an enzyme in the reaction of p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters with hydrogen peroxide resulting in the peracid formation.

Previously, two analogues of these peptides, neuroVAL and protonectin&#8208;F were designed to reduce nonspecific toxicity and improve potency. Here, the three&#8208;dimensional structures of neuroVAL, protonectin and protonectin&#8208;F were determined using circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy.

All peptides showed moderate antimicrobial activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, with agelaia&#8208;MPI being the most active. Protonectin and protonectin&#8208;F were found to be toxic to cancerous and non&#8208;cancerous cell lines. Internalization experiments revealed that these peptides accumulate inside both cell types. By contrast, neuroVAL was nontoxic to all tested cells and was able to enter cells without accumulating. In summary, neuroVAL has potential as a non&#8208;toxic cell penetrating peptide, while protonectin&#8208;F needs further modification to realize its potential as an antitumor peptide.</dc:description>

      <title>&#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin encapsulation of synthetic AHLs: drug delivery implications and quorum&#8208;quenching exploits.</title>
      <dc:description>Many bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, regulate phenotypic switching in a population density&#8208;dependent manner through a phenomenon known as quorum sensing (QS). For Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, QS relies on the synthesis, transmission, and perception of low molecular weight signal molecules that are predominantly N&#8208;acyl&#8208;L&#8208;homoserine lactones (AHLs). Efforts to disrupt AHL&#8208;mediated QS have largely focused on the development of synthetic AHL analogues (SAHLAs) that are structurally similar to native AHLs. However, like AHLs, these molecules tend to be hydrophobic and are poorly soluble under aqueous conditions. Water&#8208;soluble macrocycles, such as cyclodextrins (CDs), that encapsulate hydrophobic guests, have long been used by both agricultural and pharmaceutical industries to overcome solubility issues associated with hydrophobic compounds of interest. Conveniently, CDs have also demonstrated anti&#8208;AHL&#8208;mediated QS effects. Here, using fluorescence spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, and mass spectrometry, we evaluate the affinity of SAHLAs, as well as their hydrolysis products, for &#946;&#8208;CD inclusion. We also evaluated the ability of these complexes to inhibit wildtype P. aeruginosa virulence in a Caenorhabditis elegans host infection study, for the first time. Our efforts confirm the potential of &#946;&#8208;CDs for the improved delivery of SAHLAs at the host:microbial interface, expanding the utility of this approach as a strategy for probing and controlling QS.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>&#946; &#8208;Glucosidases are used in the food industry to hydrolyse glycosidic bonds in complex sugars, with enzymes sourced from extremophiles better able to tolerate the process conditions.

The enzyme exhibited excellent tolerance to fructose and good tolerance to glucose, retaining 65% activity in the presence of 10% (  w/v  ) glucose. It also tolerated organic solvents, some of which appeared to have a stimulating effect, in particular ethanol with a 1.7&#8208;fold increase in activity at 10% (  v/v  ). The enzyme was then applied for the cleavage of isoflavone from isoflavone glucosides in an ethanolic extract of soy flour, to produce soy isoflavones which constitute a valuable food supplement, achieving full conversion within 15 min at 30 &#176;C.</dc:description>

      <title>Advanced understanding of electron transfer pathway of cytochrome P450s</title>
      <dc:description>Cytochrome P450s (P450s) are heme&#8208;thiolate enzymes that participate in carbon source assimilation, natural compound biosynthesis and xenobiotics metabolism in all kingdoms of life. P450s can catalyze various reactions using a wide range of organic compounds, thus exhibiting great potentials in biotechnological applications. The catalytic reactions of P450s are driven by electron equivalents that are sourced from pyridine nucleotides and delivered by cognate or matching redox partners (RPs). The electron transfer (ET) route from RPs to P450s involves one or more redox center&#8208;containing domain. As ET rate is one of the main determinants of P450 efficacy, the in&#8208;depth understanding of P450 ET pathway should increase our knowledge of these important enzymes and benefit their further applications. Here, the various P450 RP systems along with current understanding of their ET routes will be reviewed. Notably, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art structural studies of two main types of self&#8208;sufficient P450 will also be summarized.</dc:description>

      <title>Biosynthetic Intermediate Probes for Visualizing and Identifying the Biosynthetic Enzymes of Plant Metabolites</title>
      <dc:description>
See what&#8216;s missing: Biosynthetic study of plant metabolites paves the way for manufacturing plant&#8208;derived drugs by synthetic biology. However, identifying any missing enzymes in a plant metabolic pathway is a formidable challenge. Biosynthetic intermediate probes make potentially useful tools to resolve the challenge by visualizing biosynthetic enzymes to facilitate transcriptome analysis or chemical proteomics approaches for identifying the biosynthetic enzymes.







Abstract
Plant metabolites play important roles in both plant physiology and drug discovery. Taking advantage of new emerging technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS), whole genome assembly, bioinformatics, omics&#8208;based strategies have been demonstrated as popular and powerful ways to elucidate complex metabolic pathways in plants. In this viewpoint, biosynthetic intermediates probes have been proposed as the potentinal tools to study the plant natural product biosynthesis via chemical proteomics appoaches or transcriptome analysis.

      <title>Chemical Translational Biology: Redefining Druggability of Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Protein&#8208;protein interactions are challenging targets for drug discovery. The field of chemical translational biology has made advances in making these once &#8220;undruggable&#8221; targets more amenable to ligand discovery and design. The development of peptide therapeutics and the discovery of adaptive and allosteric ligands show particular promise for difficult interactions.







Abstract
Chemical biologists use chemical tools to answer biological questions. The translational application of these principles has led to an explosion in the discovery and druggability of new protein targets, including protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs). Proteins tend to interact with other macromolecules using relatively large and featureless binding surfaces, which has hampered traditional drug discovery efforts, particularly for interactions with weaker affinity. In this article, I discuss several emerging strategies for targeting PPIs, including computational and structural methods and novel screening approaches. In particular, I focus on hijacking intrinsic protein allosteric pathways for the discovery and design of small&#8208;molecule and peptide ligands.

      <title>Courses Based on iGEM/BIOMOD Competitions Are the Ideal Format for Research&#8208;Based Learning of Xenobiology</title>
      <dc:description>
Competition experiments: &#8220;iGEM&#8208;Synthetic Biology&#8221; is a student&#8208;centered, research&#8208;based teaching format for xenobiology. Students conduct their own experiments in an interdisciplinary team with a focus on participation in an international competition. Such formats motivate students to show the highest performance and are possibly the best way to teach novel emerging research fields within the Humboldtian model of higher education.







Abstract
Synthetic biology and especially xenobiology, as emerging new fields of science, have reached an intellectual and experimental maturity that makes them suitable for integration into the university curricula of chemical and biological disciplines. Novel scientific fields that include laboratory work are perfect playgrounds for developing highly motivating research&#8208;based teaching modules. We believe that research&#8208;based learning enriched by digital tools is the best approach for teaching new emerging essentials of academic education. This is especially true when the scientific field as such is still not canonized with text books and best&#8208;practice examples. Our experience shows that iGEM/BIOMOD competitions represent an excellent basis for designing research&#8208;based courses in xenobiology. Therefore, we present a report on &#8220;iGEM&#8211;Synthetic Biology&#8221; offered at the Technische Universit&#228;t Berlin as an example.

      <title>Site Directed Mutagenesis of Modular Polyketide Synthase Ketoreductase Domains for Altered Stereochemical Control</title>
      <dc:description>Bacterial modular type I polyketide synthases (PKSs) are complex multidomain assembly line proteins that produce a range of pharmaceutically relevant molecules with a high degree of stereochemical control. Due to their colinear properties, they have been considerable targets for rational biosynthetic pathway engineering.&#160; Among the domains harbored within these complex assembly lines, ketoreductase (KR) domains have been extensively studied with the goal of altering their stereoselectivity via site directed mutagenesis, as they confer much of the stereochemical complexity present in pharmaceutically active reduced polyketide scaffolds.&#160; Here we review all efforts to date to perform site directed mutagenesis on PKS KRs, most of which have been done in the context of excised KR domains on model diffusible substrates such as &#946;&#8208;keto N&#8208;acetyl cysteamine thioesters.&#160; We also discuss the challenges around translating the findings of these studies to alter stereocontrol in the context of a complex multidomain enzymatic assembly line.</dc:description>

      <title>Engineering the Next Generation of Matched Models for Chemical Translational Biology</title>
      <dc:description>
Matched models: The translation of drug compounds from high&#8208;throughput models to high&#8208;order, low&#8208;throughput biological models is a major obstacle facing chemical biology. I present here a case for considering the next generation of matched biological models to address this bottleneck.







Abstract
In order to achieve patient personalization and translate compounds through the discovery phase into the clinic, high throughput test models should be designed to be as closely matched to the patient as possible. Engineering high throughput and physiologically relevant biological models is the idealized scenario for testing next generation modulators. I present here a cautionary example of a misaligned model as well as my viewpoint on how overcoming this bottleneck is one of the next frontiers in chemical biology.

      <title>Trypsiligase&#8208;catalyzed labeling of proteins on living cells</title>
      <dc:description>Fluorescent fusion proteins are powerful tools for studying biological processes in living cells, but universal application is limited due to the voluminous size of those tags which may impact the folding, localization or even the biological function of the target protein. The designed biocatalyst Trypsiligase enables site&#8208;directed linkage of small&#8208;sized fluorescence dyes on the N&#8208;terminus of integral target proteins located in the outer membrane of living cells via a stable native peptide bond. The function of the approach was tested using the examples of covalent derivatization of the transmembrane proteins CD147 as well as the EGF receptor, both presented on human HeLa cells. Specific Trypsiligase recognition of the site of linkage was mediated by the dipeptide sequence Arg&#8208;His added to the proteins&#8217; native N&#8208;termini, pointing outside the cell membrane. The labeling procedure takes only about 5 minutes, as demonstrated for couplings of the fluorescence dye tetramethyl rhodamine and the affinity label biotin as well.</dc:description>

      <title>Genetic Incorporation of Selenotyrosine Significantly Improves Enzymatic Activity of Agrobacterium radiobacter Phosphotriesterase</title>
      <dc:description>Tyrosine plays important roles in many enzyme catalysts. To facilitate enzyme design, mechanistic studies and minimize structural perturbation in the active site, here we report the genetic incorporation of a novel unnatural amino acid selenotyrosine (SeHF), which has single atom replacement in comparison to tyrosine. The  Agrobacterium radiobacter  phosphotriesterase (  ar  PTE) Tyr309SeHF mutant exhibits a significant 12&#8208;fold increase in  k  cat  and 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in  k  cat  /  K  m  at pH 7.0.  Molecular dynamics simulation  shows that the SeHF309 mutation results in a conformational switch which opens up the product release pocket and increases the product release rate, thereby elevating the overall enzyme activity. Significant improvement of the catalytic efficiency at neutral pH by single unnatural amino acid (UAA) mutation broadens the application of this enzyme, and provides valuable insights to the mechanism. Our method represents a new approach for designing enzymes with enhanced activities.</dc:description>
