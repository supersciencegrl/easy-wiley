         <title>Photo&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linking between BrU and Pyrene Residues in an RNA/DNA Hybrid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoreaction of BrU in a pyrene&#8208;labeled DNA duplex, RNA duplex, and DNA/RNA hybrids was investigated. We found that the photoreactivity of BrU changed dramatically from hydrogen abstraction to cross&#8208;linking by changing the conformation of the duplex from the B&#8208;form to the A&#8208;form.







Abstract
In this study, we investigated the photoreaction of BrU in a pyrene&#8208;labeled DNA duplex, RNA duplex, and DNA/RNA hybrids. We found that the photoreactivity of BrU changed dramatically from hydrogen abstraction to cross&#8208;linking by changing the conformation of the duplex from the B&#8208;form to the A&#8208;form. Among three A&#8208;form structures, the largest amount of cross&#8208;linked products was observed when BrU was incorporated into the RNA strand and the pyrene was conjugated to the 5&#8242; end of the DNA. These results indicate that the contact manner of pyrene was different between A&#8208; and B&#8208;form duplexes. This is a rare example of the use of the reactivity of bromouracil to analyze the contact between a small molecule with a weak binding affinity and a nucleic acid.

         <title>Synthetic Neoglycoconjugates of Hepta&#8208; and Nonamannoside Ligands for Eliciting Oligomannose&#8208;Specific HIV&#8208;1&#8208;Neutralizing Antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anomeric hepta&#8208; and nonamannoside 3&#8208;aminopropyl derivatives were prepared in good overall yields using a block&#8208;wise assembly followed by conversion into neoglycoconjugates. CRM197 conjugates of the &#946;&#8208;variants showed comparable binding to Fabs of HIV&#8208;1 neutralizing PGT antibodies, but stronger binding of the heptamannosides by the corresponding IgG antibodies.







Abstract
Oligomannose&#8208;type glycans on the spike protein of HIV&#8208;1 constitute relevant epitopes to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). Herein we describe an improved synthesis of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;linked hepta&#8208; and nonamannosyl ligands that were subsequently converted into BSA and CRM197 neoglycoconjugates. We assembled the ligands from anomeric 3&#8208;azidopropyl spacer glycosides from select 3&#8208;O&#8208;protected thiocresyl mannoside donors. Chain extensions were achieved using [4+3] or [4+5] block synthesis of thiocresyl and trichloroacetimidate glycosyl donors. Subsequent global deprotection generated the 3&#8208;aminopropyl oligosaccharide ligands. ELISA binding data obtained with the &#946;&#8208;anomeric hepta&#8208; and nonamannosyl conjugates with a selection of HIV&#8208;1 bnAbs showed comparable binding of both mannosyl ligands by Fab fragments yet lesser binding of the nonasaccharide conjugate by the corresponding IgG antibodies. These results support previous observations that a complete Man9 structure might not be the preferred antigenic binding motif for some oligomannose&#8208;specific antibodies, and have implications for glycoside designs to elicit oligomannose&#8208;targeted HIV&#8208;1&#8208;neutralizing antibodies.

         <title>Engineering formaldehyde dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida to favor nicotinamide cytosine dinucleotide</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enzyme formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FalDH) from  Pseudomonas putida  is of particular interest for biotechnological applications as it catalyses the oxidation of formaldehyde independent of glutathione. However, the consumption of a stoichiometric amount of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) can be challenging at the metabolic level as this may affect many other NAD&#8208;linked processes. A potential solution is to engineer FalDH to utilize non&#8208;natural cofactors. Here we devised FalDH variants to favor nicotinamide cytosine dinucleotide (NCD) by structure&#8208;guided modification of the binding pocket for the adenine moiety of NAD. Several mutants were obtained and the best one FalDH 9B2 had over 150&#8208;fold higher preference for NCD than NAD. Molecular docking analysis indicated that the cofactor binding pocket shrinked to better fit NCD, a smaller&#8208;sized cofactor. FalDH 9B2 together with other NCD&#8208;linked enzymes offer opportunities to assemble orthogonal pathways for biological conversion of C1 molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>The pH&#8208;Dependence of the Hydration of 5&#8208;Formylcytosine: an Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrate content of 5&#8208;formylcytosine and its uracil derivative has been identified and quantified using a combination of NMR and mass spectroscopic measurements as well as theoretical studies. We report a free energy of hydration for the hydration reactions of 5&#8201;fC and 5&#8201;fU. In case of 5&#8201;fC, acidification leads to an increased hydrate content of up to 0.5&#8201;% in aqueous solution.







Abstract
5&#8208;Formylcytosine is an important nucleobase in epigenetic regulation, whose hydrate form has been implicated in the formation of 5&#8208;carboxycytosine as well as oligonucleotide binding events. The hydrate content of 5&#8208;formylcytosine and its uracil derivative has now been quantified using a combination of NMR and mass spectroscopic measurements as well as theoretical studies. Small amounts of hydrate can be identified for the protonated form of 5&#8208;formylcytosine and for neutral 5&#8208;formyluracil. For neutral 5&#8208;formylcytosine, however, direct detection of the hydrate was not possible due to its very low abundance. This is in full agreement with theoretical estimates.

         <title>Dibenzocyclooctyne&#8208;branched primer assembled gene nanovector and its potential applications in genome editing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CRISPR/Cas9 system has been widely used as an efficient genome editing toolkit for gene therapy. The delivery of vectors encoding the full CRISPR/Cas9 components including Cas9 gene and gRNA expression element into cells is the crucial step to effective genome editing. However, the cargo gene sequence for genome editing was usually large, which reduced the cargo encapsulation efficiency and affected the vector size. To obtain a kind of nanovector with high cargo gene loading capacity and biocompatible size, we reported the construction of the gene nanovector from branch&#8208;PCR with the dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;branched primer and established the correlation mapping between gene length and nanovector size. The results showed that the size of nanovectors could be tuned according to the gene length. According to the findings, we constructed nanovectors carrying the full CRISPR/Cas9 components within 100&#8208;200 nm and validated their application in genome editing. The results showed that this kind of nanovector exhibited the higher serum stability than plasmids and could reach the comparable genome editing efficiency with plasmids. Hence, this kind of gene nanovector through branch&#8208;PCR could carry large cargo genes and maintained biocompatible nanoscale size, which hopefully expanded its medical applications in gene therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Biocatalytic Properties of an Azoreductase via the N&#8208;Terminal Fusion of Formate Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fusion protein comprised of formate dehydrogenase and azoreductase was constructed to allow the simultaneous activity of dye reduction and NAD+ regeneration. The fusion protein showed improved substrate scope, but it only showed partial degradation for the bulkier azo dyes.







Abstract
Azoreductases require NAD(P)H to reduce azo dyes but the high cost of NAD(P)H limits its application. Formate dehydrogenase (FDH) allows NAD(P)+ recycling and therefore, the fusion of these two biocatalysts seems promising. This study investigated the changes to the fusion protein involving azoreductase (AzoRo) of Rhodococcus opacus 1CP and FDH (FDHC23S and FDHC23SD195QY196H) of Candida boidinii in different positions with His&#8208;tag as the linker. The position affected enzyme activities as AzoRo activity decreased by 20&#8208;fold when it is in the N&#8208;terminus of the fusion protein. FDHC23S+AzoRo was the most active construct and was further characterized. Enzymatic activities of FDHC23S+AzoRo decreased compared to parental enzymes but showed improved substrate scope &#8211; accepting bulkier dyes. Moreover, pH has an influence on the stability and activity of the fusion protein because at pH&#8197;6 (pH that is suboptimal for FDH), the dye reduction decreased to more than 50&#8201;% and this could be attributed to the impaired NADH supply for the AzoRo part.

         <title>A Hexameric Ribozyme Nanostructure Formed by Double&#8208;Decker Assembly of a Pair of Triangular Ribozyme Trimers</title>

         <dc:description>
The modular architecture of naturally occurring ribozymes makes them a promising class of structural platform for the design and assembly of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) RNA nanostructures. We dimerized ribozyme trimers with a triangular shape by introducing three pillar units. The double&#8208;decker hexamers exhibited higher catalytic activity than the parent ribozyme trimers.







Abstract
The modular architecture of naturally occurring ribozymes makes them a promising class of structural platform for the design and assembly of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) RNA nanostructures, into which the catalytic ability of the platform ribozyme can be installed. We have constructed and analyzed RNA nanostructures with polygonal&#8208;shaped (closed) ribozyme oligomers by assembling unit RNAs derived from the Tetrahymena group I intron with a typical modular architecture. In this study, we dimerized ribozyme trimers with a triangular shape by introducing three pillar units. The resulting double&#8208;decker nanostructures containing six ribozyme units were characterized biochemically and their structures were observed by atomic force microscopy. The double&#8208;decker hexamers exhibited higher catalytic activity than the parent ribozyme trimers.

         <title>An engineered cholesterol oxidase catalyses enantioselective oxidation of non&#8208;steroidal secondary alcohols</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enantioselective oxidation of 2o alcohols to ketones is an important reaction in synthetic chemistry, especially if it can be achieved using O2 &#8208;driven alcohol oxidases under mild reaction conditions. However to date, oxidation of secondary alcohols using alcohol oxidases has focused on activated benzylic or allylic substrates, with unactivated secondary alcohols showing poor activity. Here we show that cholesterol oxidase (EC 1.1.3.6) could be engineered for activity towards a range of aliphatic, cyclic, acyclic, allylic and benzylic secondary alcohols. Additionally, since the variants demonstrated high (S)&#8208;selectivity, deracemisation reactions were performed in the presence of ammonia borane to obtain enantiopure (R)&#8208;alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered Bacterial Flavin&#8208;Dependent Monooxygenases for the Regiospecific Hydroxylation of Polycyclic Phenols</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability to perform regiospecific hydroxylations of sterically challenging monophenols was engineered into a flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase. Its variants are valuable tools for production of the corresponding catechols for in&#8197;vitro or live whole&#8208;cell conversions.







Abstract
4&#8208;Hydroxyphenylacetate 3&#8208;hydroxylase (4HPA3H), a flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase from E. coli that catalyzes the hydroxylation of monophenols to catechols, was modified by rational redesign to convert also more bulky substrates, especially phenolic natural products like phenylpropanoids, flavones or coumarins. Selected amino acid positions in the binding pocket of 4HPA3H were exchanged with residues from the homologous protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, yielding variants with improved conversion of spacious substrates such as the flavonoid naringenin or the alkaloid mimetic 2&#8208;hydroxycarbazole. Reactions were followed by an adapted Fe(III)&#8208;catechol chromogenic assay selective for the products. Especially substitution of the residue Y301 facilitated modulation of substrate specificity: introduction of nonaromatic but hydrophobic (iso)leucine resulted in the preference of the substrate ferulic acid (having a guaiacyl (guajacyl) moiety, part of the vanilloid motif) over unsubstituted monophenols. The in&#8197;vivo (whole&#8208;cell biocatalysts) and in&#8197;vitro (three&#8208;enzyme cascade) transformations of substrates by 4HPA3H and its optimized variants was strictly regiospecific and proceeded without generation of byproducts.

         <title>Dual Activities of Oxidation and Oxidative Decarboxylation by Flavoenzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual functions by a single active site are found in flavoenzyme oxidases. This is the first review to discuss and compare the reaction mechanisms of flavoenzymes catalyzing both oxidation and oxidative decarboxylation of l&#8208;amino acids and &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid. Recurrent features and factor controlling oxidative decarboxylation are proposed.







Abstract
Specific flavoenzyme oxidases catalyze oxidative decarboxylation in addition to their classical oxidation reactions in the same active sites. The mechanisms underlying oxidative decarboxylation by these enzymes and how they control their two activities are not clearly known. This article reviews the current state of knowledge of four enzymes from the l&#8208;amino acid oxidase and l&#8208;hydroxy acid oxidase families, including l&#8208;tryptophan 2&#8208;monooxygenase, l&#8208;phenylalanine 2&#8208;oxidase and l&#8208;lysine oxidase/monooxygenase and lactate monooxygenase which catalyze substrate oxidation and oxidative decarboxylation. Apart from specific interactions to allow substrate oxidation by the flavin cofactor, specific binding of oxidized product in the active sites appears to be important for enabling subsequent decarboxylation by these enzymes. Based on recent findings of l&#8208;lysine oxidase/monooxygenase, we propose that nucleophilic attack of H2O2 on the imino acid product is the mechanism enabling oxidative decarboxylation.

         <title>Optimized Hemolysin Type 1 Secretion System in Escherichia coli by Directed Evolution of the Hly Enhancer Fragment and Including a Terminator Region</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Secretion efficiency of the Hly secretion system was optimized through directed evolution of the Hly enhancer fragment using KnowVolution strategy. The structural analysis of wildtype and the developed enhancer fragment suggested that the improved secretion is due to a different affinity of the novel enhancer fragment towards the S1 ribosomal protein. This was further supported by a RNA pulldown assay.







Abstract
Type 1 secretion systems (T1SS) have a relatively simple architecture compared to other classes of secretion systems and therefore, are attractive to be optimized by protein engineering. Here, we report a KnowVolution campaign for the hemolysin (Hly) enhancer fragment, an untranslated region upstream of the hlyA gene, of the hemolysin T1SS of Escherichia coli to enhance its secretion efficiency. The best performing variant of the Hly enhancer fragment contained five nucleotide mutations at five positions (A30U, A36U, A54G, A81U, and A116U) resulted in a 2&#8208;fold increase in the secretion level of a model lipase fused to the secretion carrier HlyA1. Computational analysis suggested that altered affinity to the generated enhancer fragment towards the S1 ribosomal protein contributes to the enhanced secretion levels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that involving a native terminator region along with the generated Hly enhancer fragment increased the secretion levels of the Hly system up to 5&#8208;fold.

         <title>The &#945;/&#946; hydrolase AzpM catalyzes dipeptide synthesis in alazopeptin biosynthesis using two molecules of carrier protein&#8208;tethered amino acid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During the biosynthesis of alazopeptin, a tripeptide composed of two molecules of 6&#8208;diazo&#8208;5&#8208;oxo&#8208;L&#8208;norleucine (DON) and one of alanine, the &#945;/&#946; hydrolase AzpM synthesizes the DON&#8208;DON dipeptide using DON tethered to the carrier protein AzpF (DON&#8208;AzpF). However, whether AzpM catalyzes the condensation of DON&#8208;AzpF with DON or DON&#8208;AzpF remains unclear. Here, to distinguish between these two condensation possibilities, the reaction catalyzed by AzpM was examined in vitro using a DON analog, azaserine (AZS). We found that AzpM catalyzed the condensation between AZS&#8208;AzpF and DON&#8208;AzpF, but not between AZS&#8208;AzpF and DON. Possible reaction intermediates, DON&#8208;DON&#8208;AzpF and AZS&#8208;AZS&#8208;AzpF, were also detected during AzpM&#8208;catalyzed dipeptide formation from DON&#8208;AzpF and AZS&#8208;AzpF, respectively. From these results, we concluded that AzpM catalyzed the condensation of the two molecules of DON&#8208;AzpF and subsequent hydrolysis to produce DON&#8208;DON. Thus, AzpM is an unprecedented &#945;/&#946; hydrolase that catalyzes dipeptide synthesis from two molecules of a carrier protein&#8208;tethered amino acid.</dc:description>

         <title>A Four&#8208;Step Enzymatic Cascade for Efficient Production of L&#8208;Phenylglycine from Biobased L&#8208;Phenylalanine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantiopure amino acids are of particular interest in the agrochemical and pharmaceutical industries. Here,&#160;we reported a multi&#8208;enzyme cascade for efficient production of&#160;L&#8208;phenylglycine (L&#8208;Phg)&#160;from biobased&#160;L&#8208;phenylalanine (L&#8208;Phe). We first attempted to engineer&#160;Escherichia coli&#160;for expressing&#160;L&#8208;amino acid deaminase (LAAD)&#160;from&#160;Proteus mirabilis, hydroxymandelate synthase (HmaS) from&#160;Amycolatopsis orientalis,&#160;(S)&#8208;mandelate dehydrogenase&#160;(SMDH) from&#160;Pseudomonas putida,&#160;the endogenous&#160;aminotransferase&#160;(AT) encoded by&#160;ilvE&#160;and&#160;L&#8208;glutamate dehydrogenase&#160;(GluDH) from&#160;E. coli. However, 10 mM L&#8208;Phe only afforded the synthesis of 7.21 &#177; 0.15 mM L&#8208;Phg. The accumulation of benzoylformic acid suggested that the transamination step might be rate&#8208;limiting. We next used leucine dehydrogenase (LeuDH) from&#160;Bacillus cereus&#160;to bypass the use of L&#8208;glutamate as amine donor, and 40 mM L&#8208;Phe gave 39.97 &#177; 3.84 mM (6.04 &#177; 0.58 g/L) L&#8208;Phg, reaching 99.9% conversion. In summary, this work demonstrated a concise four&#8208;step enzymatic cascade for the L&#8208;Phg synthesis from biobased L&#8208;Phe, with a potential for future industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Glyco&#8208;steroidal amphiphiles (GSAs) for membrane protein structural study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integral membrane proteins pose considerable challenges to high resolution structural analysis. Maintaining membrane proteins in their native state during protein isolation is essential for structural study of these bio&#8208;macromolecules. Detergents are the most commonly used amphiphilic compounds for stabilizing membrane proteins in solution outside a lipid bilayer. We previously introduced a glyco&#8208;diosgenin (GDN) detergent that was shown to be highly effective at stabilizing a wide range of membrane proteins. This steroidal detergent has additionally gained attention due to its compatibility with membrane protein structure study  via  cryo&#8208;EM. However, synthetic inconvenience limits widespread use of GDN in membrane protein study. To improve its synthetic accessibility and to further enhance detergent efficacy for protein stabilization, we designed a new class of glyco&#8208;steroid&#8208;based detergents using three steroid units: cholestanol, cholesterol and diosgenin. These new detergents were efficiently prepared and showed marked efficacy for protein stabilization in evaluation with a few model membrane proteins including two G protein&#8208;coupled receptors. Some new agents were not only superior to a gold standard detergent, DDM, but were also more effective than the original GDN at preserving protein integrity long term. These agents represent valuable alternatives to GDN, and are likely to facilitate structural determination of challenging membrane proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Superior Peroxidase&#8208;Like activity of Gold Nanorattles in Ultrasensitive H2O2 Sensing and Antioxidant Screening</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanozymes are artificial enzyme systems which are easy to produce, highly stable and cost&#8208;effective in comparison to natural enzymes. Herein, we evaluated the peroxidase like activity of gold nanorattles (AuNRTs) having a solid gold octahedron core and thin, porous cubic gold shell. We also prepared solid gold nanocube and nanosphere of similar sizes and surface charge as that of AuNRTs and compared its activity with standard horse radish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme. All the prepared nanostructures followed Michaelis&#8208;Menten kinetics as observed from their substrate vs initial reaction velocity plot using 3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as a substrate. The kinetic parameters demonstrated that AuNRTs possess the best nanozymatic activity with lowest K  M  and highest catalytic efficiency (K  cat  /K  M  ). The better activity of AuNRTs compared with other nanostructures and HRP could be attributed to the hollow porous structure with a solid core where different surfaces are available for the nanozymatic reaction. AuNRTs, being the best amongst the tested nanozymes were further used for the sensing of hydrogen peroxide (H  2  O  2  ) and it was able to sense H  2  O  2  down to 0.5 &#956;M concentration. Further, two naturally occurring antioxidants, tannic acid and ascorbic acid showed inhibitory effect on the peroxidase like activity of AuNRTs in a concentration dependent manner which can be further be used for screening of antioxidants or for determining the antioxidant potential.</dc:description>

Abstract
Development of versatile probes that can enable the study of different conformations and recognition properties of therapeutic nucleic acid motifs by complementing biophysical techniques can greatly aid nucleic acid analysis and therapy. Here, we report the design, synthesis and incorporation of an environment&#8208;sensitive ribonucleoside analogue, which serves as a two&#8208;channel biophysical platform to investigate RNA structure and recognition by fluorescence and 19F NMR spectroscopy techniques. The nucleoside analogue is based on a 5&#8208;fluorobenzofuran&#8208;uracil core and its fluorescence and 19F NMR chemical shifts are highly sensitive to changes in solvent polarity and viscosity. Notably, the modified ribonucleotide and phosphoramidite substrates can be efficiently incorporated into RNA oligonucleotides (ONs) by in&#8197;vitro transcription and standard solid&#8208;phase ON synthesis protocol, respectively. Fluorescence and 19F readouts of the nucleoside incorporated into model RNA ONs are sensitive to the neighbouring base environment. The responsiveness of the probe was aptly utilized in detecting and quantifying the metal ion&#8208;induced conformational change in an internal ribosome entry site RNA motif of hepatitis C virus, which is an important therapeutic target. Taken together, our probe is a good addition to the nucleic acid analysis toolbox with the advantage that it can be used to study nucleic acid conformation and recognition simultaneously by two biophysical techniques.

         <title>Prebiotic Membranes and Micelles Do Not Inhibit Peptide Formation During Dehydration</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 3, February 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dried dispersions of decanoic acid vesicles produce stacks of membranes. In the presence of the dried membranes, serine&#8208;ethyl&#8208;esters are converted into dipeptides at a rate that is at least as fast as in the absence of membranes. Our results enhance the plausibility that protocells (which would have colocalized membranes, RNA, and peptides) could have developed in evaporating environments on the prebiotic Earth.







Abstract
Cycles of dehydration and rehydration could have enabled formation of peptides and RNA in otherwise unfavorable conditions on the early Earth. Development of the first protocells would have hinged upon colocalization of these biopolymers with fatty acid membranes. Using atomic force microscopy, we find that a prebiotic fatty acid (decanoic acid) forms stacks of membranes after dehydration. Using LC&#8208;MS&#8208;MS (liquid chromatography&#8208;tandem mass spectrometry) with isotope internal standards, we measure the rate of formation of serine dipeptides. We find that dipeptides form during dehydration at moderate temperatures (55&#8201;&#176;C) at least as fast in the presence of decanoic acid membranes as in the absence of membranes. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that protocells could have formed within evaporating environments on the early Earth.

         <title>Deep Sequencing of a Systematic Peptide Library Reveals Conformationally&#8208;Constrained Protein Interface Peptides that Disrupt a Protein&#8208;Protein Interaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 3, February 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disrupting protein&#8208;protein interactions is difficult due to the large and flat interaction surfaces of the binding partners. We utilized high throughput oligonucleotide synthesis, peptide phage display library construction, affinity selection, and deep sequencing to show a peptide library encompassing a binding partner in a protein&#8208;protein interaction can serve as a source of peptides that mimic the interface and provide a starting point for developing inhibitors that block the interface.







Abstract
Disrupting protein&#8208;protein interactions is difficult due to the large and flat interaction surfaces of the binding partners. The BLIP and BLIP&#8208;II proteins are unrelated in sequence and structure and yet each potently inhibit &#946;&#8208;lactamases. High&#8208;throughput oligonucleotide synthesis was used to construct a 12,470&#8208;member library containing overlapping linear and cyclic peptides ranging in size from 6 to 21 amino acids that scan through the sequences of BLIP and BLIP&#8208;II. Phage display affinity selections and deep sequencing revealed that, despite the differences in interaction surfaces with &#946;&#8208;lactamases, rapid enrichment of consensus peptide regions originating from both BLIP and BLIP&#8208;II contact residues in the binding interface occurred. BLIP and BLIP&#8208;II peptides that were enriched by affinity selection were shown to bind &#946;&#8208;lactamases and disrupt the BLIP/&#946;&#8208;lactamase interaction. The results suggest that peptides that bind at and disrupt PPI interfaces can be identified through systematic peptide library construction, affinity selection, and deep sequencing.

         <title>Selective Capture of Anti&#8208;N&#8208;glucosylated NTHi Adhesin Peptide Antibodies by a Multivalent Dextran Conjugate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 3, February 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dextran&#8208;based tentacles were decorated with peptide antigens as a way to increase the ability to capture circulating IgM antibodies in multiple sclerosis patient sera as disease biomarkers. A novel peptide&#8208;dextran conjugate bearing multiple copies of a selected epitope of the non&#8208;typeable Haemophilus Influenzae adhesin protein was synthesis and characterized. Immunological experiments provide the proof&#8208;of concept for the identification and capture of specific IgM antibodies in patient sera.







Abstract
Tentacle&#8208;like polymers decorated with several copies of peptide antigens can be interesting tools for increasing the ability to capture circulating antibodies in patient sera, using cooperative effects for stronger avidity. We previously showed that antibodies from multiple sclerosis (MS) patient sera preferentially recognize hyperglucosylated adhesin protein HMW1ct of non&#8208;typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi). We selected the C&#8208;terminal HMW1ct(1347&#8211;1354) minimal epitope and prepared the diglucosylated analogue Ac&#8208;KAN(Glc)VTLN(Glc)TTG&#8208;K(N3)&#8208;NH2 to graft a 40&#8197;kDa dextran scaffold modified with glycidyl&#8208;propargyl moieties to perform a copper catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide coupling reaction (CuAAC). Quantitative NMR measurements allowed the characterization of the peptide loading (19.5&#8201;%) on the multivalent dextran conjugate. This novel polymeric structure displayed optimal capturing properties of both IgG and, more interestingly, IgM antibodies in MS sera. Specific antibodies from a representative MS serum, were successfully depleted using a Sepharose resin bearing the new glucosylated multivalent conjugate, as confirmed by ELISA. These results may offer a promising proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the selective purification of high affinity autoantibodies from sera of autoimmune patients, in general, and of specific high affinity antibodies against a minimally glcosylated epitope Asn(Glc) from sera of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, in particular.

         <title>Galacto&#8208;Oligosaccharide Supplementation Modulates Pathogen&#8208;Commensal Competition between Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus salivarius</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 3, February 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study of the infant microbiome and how the microbiota is affected by feeding choice has recently gained interest. We designed a two&#8208;species microbiome in which a pathogen, Streptococcus agalactiae, is cultured with a commensal, Streptococcus salivarius. We discovered that the common infant formula supplement, galacto&#8208;oligosaccharides are able to reverse the effects of S. salivarius growth suppression by S. agalactiae.







Abstract
The members of the infant microbiome are governed by feeding method (breastmilk vs. formula). Regardless of the source of nutrition, a competitive growth advantage can be provided to commensals through prebiotics &#8211; either human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) or plant oligosaccharides that are supplemented into formula. To characterize how prebiotics modulate commensal &#8211; pathogen interactions, we have designed and studied a minimal microbiome where a pathogen, Streptococcus agalactiae engages with a commensal, Streptococcus salivarius. We discovered that while S. agalactiae suppresses the growth of S. salivarius via increased lactic acid production, galacto&#8208;oligosaccharides (GOS) supplementation reverses the effect. This result has major implications in characterizing how single species survive in the gut, what niche they occupy, and how they engage with other community members.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive and Reversible Nanoassemblies of G&#8208;Triplexes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 3, February 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible dimeric G&#8208;triplex nanoassemblies were developed using a ligand &#8211; an alkaloid of sanguinarine &#8211; as &#8216;glue&#8217;. The glue's adhesivity can be dynamically tuned by prevalent factors including pH, sulfite, O2 and H2O2, to efficiently regulate the G&#8208;triplex nanoassemblies. However, the G&#8208;quadruplex counterpart does not respond to give nanoassemblies. Our work provides new perspectives in developing G&#8208;triplex&#8208;based nanodevices.







Abstract
G&#8208;triplex (G3) structures formed with three consecutive G&#8208;tracts have recently been identified as a new emerging guanine&#8208;rich DNA fold. There could likely be a wide range of biological functions for G3s as occurring for G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures formed with four consecutive G&#8208;tracts. However, in comparison to the many reports on G4 nanoassemblies that organize monomers together in a controllable manner, G3&#8208;favored nanoassemblies have yet to be explored. In this work, we found that a natural alkaloid of sanguinarine can serve as a dynamic ligand glue to reversibly switch the dimeric nanoassemblies of the thrombin binding aptamer G3 (TBA&#8208;G3). The glue planarity was considered to be a crucial factor for realizing this switching. More importantly, external stimuli including pH, sulfite, O2 and H2O2 can be employed as common regulators to easily modulate the glue's adhesivity for constructing and destructing the G3 nanoassemblies as a result of the ligand converting between isoforms. However, this assembly behavior does not occur with the counterpart TBA&#8208;G4. Our work demonstrates that higher&#8208;order G3 nanoassemblies can be reversibly operated by manipulating ligand adhesivity. This provides an alternative understanding of the unique behavior of guanine&#8208;rich sequences and focuses attention on the G3 fold since the nanoassembly event investigated herein might occur in living cells.

         <title>Exploring Dihydroflavonol&#8208;4&#8208;Reductase Reactivity and Selectivity by QM/MM&#8208;MD Simulations</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 3, February 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dihydroflavonol&#8208;4&#8208;reductase catalysis of dihydroflavonols into leucoanthocyanidins is promoted by access to near&#8208;attack conformers (NAC) by lowering the activation barrier (&#9653;G&#8800;). The frequency of sampling of these metastable pre&#8208;reactive states is an important factor influencing DFR selectivity, which reduces the dihydroquercetin substrate faster than dihydrokaempferol.







Abstract
Flavonoids are secondary metabolites ubiquitously found in plants. Their antioxidant properties make them highly interesting natural compounds for use in pharmacology. Therefore, unravelling the mechanisms of flavonoid biosynthesis is an important challenge. Among all the enzymes involved in this biosynthetic pathway, dihydroflavonol&#8208;4&#8208;reductase (DFR) plays a key role in the production of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins. Here, we provide new information on the mechanism of action of this enzyme by using QM/MM&#8208;MD simulations applied to both dihydroquercetin (DHQ) and dihydrokaempferol (DHK) substrates. The consideration of these very similar compounds shed light on the major role played by the enzyme on the stabilization of the transition state but also on the activation of the substrate before the reaction through near&#8208;attack conformer effects.

         <title>Characterization of Structure and Dynamics of the Guanidine&#8208;II Riboswitch from Escherichia coli by NMR Spectroscopy and Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering (SAXS)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 3, February 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gdn&#8208;II riboswitch aptamer from E.&#8197;coli with wild&#8208;type and loop&#8208;mutated constructs were investigated in the context of ligand interactions. Based on NMR spectroscopy and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) data, previous crystal structures were confirmed, and an intermolecular ligand binding mechanism with the P1 loop as interaction interface instead of the postulated (intramolecular) P1&#8208;P2 kissing loop was found.







Abstract
Riboswitches are regulatory RNA elements that undergo functionally important allosteric conformational switching upon binding of specific ligands. The here investigated guanidine&#8208;II riboswitch binds the small cation, guanidinium, and forms a kissing loop&#8208;loop interaction between its P1 and P2 hairpins. We investigated the structural changes to support previous studies regarding the binding mechanism. Using NMR spectroscopy, we confirmed the structure as observed in crystal structures and we characterized the kissing loop interaction upon addition of Mg2+ and ligand for the riboswitch aptamer from Escherichia coli. We further investigated closely related mutant constructs providing further insight into functional differences between the two (different) hairpins P1 and P2. Formation of intermolecular interactions were probed by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and NMR DOSY data. All data are consistent and show the formation of oligomeric states of the riboswitch induced by Mg2+ and ligand binding.

         <title>Novel Quinic Acid Glycerates from Tussilago farfara Inhibit Polypeptide GalNAc&#8208;Transferase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 3, February 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of quinic acid&#8208;caffeic acid conjugate isolated from T.&#8197;farfara, was found to inhibit the activity of GalNAc&#8208;T2.







Abstract
The discovery of a bioactive inhibitor tool for human polypeptide N&#8208;acetylgalactosaminyl transferases (GalNAc&#8208;Ts), the initiating enzyme for mucin&#8208;type O&#8208;glycosylation, remains challenging. In the present study, we identified an array of quinic acid derivatives, including four new glycerates (1&#8211;4) from Tussilago farfara, a traditional Chinese medicinal plant, as active inhibitors of GalNAc&#8208;T2 using a combined screening approach with a cell&#8208;based T2&#8208;specific sensor and purified enzyme assay. These inhibitors dose&#8208;dependently inhibited human GalNAc&#8208;T2 but did not affect O&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT), the other type of glycosyltransferase. Importantly, they are not cytotoxic and retain inhibitory activity in cells lacking elongated O&#8208;glycans, which are eliminated by the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing tool. A structure&#8208;activity relationship study unveiled a novel quinic acid&#8208;caffeic acid conjugate pharmacophore that directs inhibition. Overall, these new natural product inhibitors could serve as a basis for developing an inhibitor tool for GalNAc&#8208;T2.

         <title>Identification and Analysis of the Biosynthetic Gene Cluster for the Indolizidine Alkaloid Iminimycin in Streptomyces griseus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 3, February 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthetic gene cluster for iminimycin, an indolizidine alkaloid with a 6&#8208;5&#8208;3 tricyclic system containing an iminium cation from Streptomyces griseus, was identified. It has 22 genes, including four genes encoding polyketide synthases, which consist of eight modules. Inactivation of seven tailoring enzyme&#8208;encoding genes and structural elucidation of compounds accumulated in the mutants provided important insights into iminimycin biosynthesis.







Abstract
Indolizidine alkaloids, which have versatile bioactivities, are produced by various organisms. Although the biosynthesis of some indolizidine alkaloids has been studied, the enzymatic machinery for their biosynthesis in Streptomyces remains elusive. Here, we report the identification and analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster for iminimycin, an indolizidine alkaloid with a 6&#8208;5&#8208;3 tricyclic system containing an iminium cation from Streptomyces griseus. The gene cluster has 22 genes, including four genes encoding polyketide synthases (PKSs), which consist of eight modules in total. In&#8197;vitro analysis of the first module revealed that its acyltransferase domain selects malonyl&#8208;CoA, although predicted to select methylmalonyl&#8208;CoA. Inactivation of seven tailoring enzyme&#8208;encoding genes and structural elucidation of four compounds accumulated in mutants provided important insights into iminimycin biosynthesis, although some of these compounds appeared to be shunt products. This study expands our knowledge of the biosynthetic machinery of indolizidine alkaloids and the enzymatic chemistry of PKS.

         <title>Polymerase Synthesis of DNA Containing Iodinated Pyrimidine or 7&#8208;Deazapurine Nucleobases and Their Post&#8208;synthetic Modifications through the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>
Iodinated pyrimidine or 7&#8208;deazapurine 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates were found to be excellent substrates for DNA polymerases in enzymatic construction of oligonucleotide (ONs) or DNA containing iodinated nucleobases. The post&#8208;synthetic modifications through Suzuki cross&#8208;couplings worked in the terminal positions or single&#8208;stranded ONs but not in internal positions of double&#8208;stranded DNA.







Abstract
All four iodinated 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) derived from 5&#8208;iodouracil, 5&#8208;iodocytosine, 7&#8208;iodo&#8208;7&#8208;deazaadenine and 7&#8208;iodo&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine were prepared and studied as substrates for KOD XL DNA polymerase. All of the nucleotides were readily incorporated by primer extension and by PCR amplification to form DNA containing iodinated nucleobases. Systematic study of the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions with two bulkier arylboronic acids revealed that the 5&#8208;iodopyrimidines were more reactive and gave cross&#8208;coupling products both in the terminal or internal position in single&#8208;stranded oligonucleotides (ssONs) and in the terminal position of double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA), whereas the 7&#8208;iodo&#8208;7&#8208;deazapurines were less reactive and gave cross&#8208;coupling products only in the terminal position. None of the four iodinated bases reacted in an internal position of dsDNA. These findings are useful for the use of the iodinated nucleobases for post&#8208;synthetic modification of DNA with functional groups for various applications.

         <title>Fluorobenzene Nucleobase Analogues for Triplex&#8208;Forming Peptide Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 3, February 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2,4&#8208;Difluorobenzene as a nonpolar isosteric analogue of uridine nucleobase in peptide nucleic acid forms a Hoogsteen base triplet with adenosine&#8208;uridine base pair in double helical RNA. The stability and selectivity of modified triplets suggest that 2,4&#8208;difluorobenzene uses fluorine and C&#8722;H groups in non&#8208;canonical hydrogen bonding similar to natural uridine&#8208;adenosine&#8208;uridine base triplets.







Abstract
2,4&#8208;Difluorotoluene is a nonpolar isostere of thymidine that has been used as a powerful mechanistic probe to study the role of hydrogen bonding in nucleic acid recognition and interactions with polymerases. In the present study, we evaluated five fluorinated benzenes as nucleobase analogues in peptide nucleic acids designed for triple helical recognition of double helical RNA. We found that analogues having para and ortho fluorine substitution patterns (as in 2,4&#8208;difluorotoluene) selectively stabilized Hoogsteen triplets with U&#8722;A base pairs. The results were consistent with attractive electrostatic interactions akin to non&#8208;canonical F to H&#8722;N and C&#8722;H to N hydrogen bonding. The fluorinated nucleobases were not able to stabilize Hoogsteen&#8208;like triplets with pyrimidines in either G&#8722;C or A&#8722;U base pairs. Our results illustrate the ability of fluorine to engage in non&#8208;canonical base pairing and provide insights into triple helical recognition of RNA.

         <title>A Multi&#8208;enzyme Cascade for the Biosynthesis of AICA Ribonucleoside Di&#8208; and Triphosphate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 3, February 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of AICA (5&#8242;&#8208;aminoimidazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxamide) nucleotides, the pharmaceutically active metabolites of AICA based drugs, was explored in this study. In an enzymatic cascade, a phosphoribosyl transferase is combined with two different polyphosphate kinases to selectively produce AICA ribonucleoside di&#8208; or triphosphate, respectively.







Abstract
AICA (5&#8242;&#8208;aminoimidazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxamide) ribonucleotides with different phosphorylation levels are the pharmaceutically active metabolites of AICA nucleoside&#8208;based drugs. The chemical synthesis of AICA ribonucleotides with defined phosphorylation is challenging and expensive. In this study, we describe two enzymatic cascades to synthesize AICA derivatives with defined phosphorylation levels from the corresponding nucleobase and the co&#8208;substrate phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate. The cascades are composed of an adenine phosphoribosyltransferase from Escherichia coli (EcAPT) and different polyphosphate kinases: polyphosphate kinase from Acinetobacter johnsonii (AjPPK), and polyphosphate kinase from Meiothermus ruber (MrPPK). The role of the EcAPT is to bind the nucleobase to the sugar moiety, while the kinases are responsible for further phosphorylation of the nucleotide to produce the desired phosphorylated AICA ribonucleotide. The selected enzymes were characterized, and conditions were established for two enzymatic cascades. The diphosphorylated AICA ribonucleotide derivative ZDP, synthesized from the cascade EcAPT/AjPPK, was produced with a conversion up to 91&#8201;%. The EcAPT/MrPPK cascade yielded ZTP with conversion up to 65&#8201;% with ZDP as a side product.

         <title>Tailoring Enzyme Stringency Masks the Multispecificity of a Lyngbyatoxin (Indolactam Alkaloid) Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 3, February 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indolactam alkaloids are potentially valuable molecular tools for modulating the activity of protein kinase C. In an attempt to generate novel lyngbyatoxin (LTX) variants, we mutated the A&#8208;domain of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase, LtxA, in an engineered E.&#8197;coli strain expressing the cyanobacterial LTX pathway. The mutations resulted in the differential production of valine&#8208;, isoleucine&#8208;, and leucine&#8208;derived pathway products.







Abstract
Indolactam alkaloids are activators of protein kinase C (PKC) and are of pharmacological interest for the treatment of pathologies involving PKC dysregulation. The marine cyanobacterial nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) pathway for lyngbyatoxin biosynthesis, which we previously expressed in E.&#8197;coli, was studied for its amenability towards the biosynthesis of indolactam variants. Modification of culture conditions for our E.&#8197;coli heterologous expression host and analysis of pathway products suggested the native lyngbyatoxin pathway NRPS does possess a degree of relaxed specificity. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis of two positions within the adenylation domain (A&#8208;domain) substrate&#8208;binding pocket was performed, resulting in an alteration of substrate preference between valine, isoleucine, and leucine. We observed relative congruence of in&#8197;vitro substrate activation by the LtxA NRPS to in&#8197;vivo product formation. While there was a preference for isoleucine over leucine, the substitution of alternative tailoring domains may unveil the true in&#8197;vivo effects of the mutations introduced herein.

Site-directed mutagenesis of two positions within the adenylation domain (A-domain) substrate-binding pocket was performed, resulting in an alteration of substrate preference between valine, isoleucine, and leucine. We observed relative congruence of &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; substrate activation by the LtxA NRPS to &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt; product formation. While there was a preference for isoleucine over leucine, the substitution of alternative tailoring domains may unveil the true &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt; effects of the mutations introduced herein.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Targeting the Central Pocket of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Lectin LecA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 3, February 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new ligand binding pocket for additional pharmacophores in inhibitors of the bacterial lectin and virulence factor LecA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified and successfully targeted, using a suite of modelling, chemical synthesis, and biophysical analyses. The crystal structure of LecA with one ligand targeting this central pocket was solved, and validated the concept.







Abstract
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic ESKAPE pathogen that produces two lectins, LecA and LecB, as part of its large arsenal of virulence factors. Both carbohydrate&#8208;binding proteins are central to the initial and later persistent infection processes, i.&#8201;e. bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. The biofilm matrix is a major resistance determinant and protects the bacteria against external threats such as the host immune system or antibiotic treatment. Therefore, the development of drugs against the P. aeruginosa biofilm is of particular interest to restore efficacy of antimicrobials. Carbohydrate&#8208;based inhibitors for LecA and LecB were previously shown to efficiently reduce biofilm formations. Here, we report a new approach for inhibiting LecA with synthetic molecules bridging the established carbohydrate&#8208;binding site and a central cavity located between two LecA protomers of the lectin tetramer. Inspired by in silico design, we synthesized various galactosidic LecA inhibitors with aromatic moieties targeting this central pocket. These compounds reached low micromolar affinities, validated in different biophysical assays. Finally, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed the interactions of this compound class with LecA. This new mode of action paves the way to a novel route towards inhibition of P. aeruginosa biofilms.

         <title>Sulfation Pattern Dependent Iron(III) Mediated Interleukin&#8208;8 Glycan Binding</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 3, February 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of hyaluronan sulfation degree and metal ion on interleukin&#8208;8 binding was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and surface characterizations.







Abstract
Cytokines such as interleukin&#8208;8 activate the immune system during infection and interact with sulfated glycosaminoglycans with specific sulfation patterns. In some cases, these interactions are mediated by metal ion binding which can be used to tune surface&#8208;based glycan&#8208;protein interactions. We evaluated the effect of both hyaluronan sulfation degree and Fe3+ on interleukin&#8208;8 binding by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and surface characterizations. Our results show that sulfation degree and metal ion interactions have a synergistic effect in tuning the electrochemical response of the glycated surfaces to the cytokine.

         <title>NAD(H)&#8208;PEG Swing Arms Improve Both the Activities and Stabilities of Modularly&#8208;Assembled Transhydrogenases Designed with Predictable Selectivities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 3, February 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using synthetic PEG&#8208;NAD(H) cofactor swing arms, we demonstrate the modular assembly of dehydrogenases to produce a series of novel, self&#8208;contained synthetic transhydrogenases. We also show that the stabilities and catalytic properties of the resulting transhydrogenases are improved without detriment to the selectivities of the native active sites.







Abstract
Protein engineering has been used to enhance the activities, selectivities, and stabilities of enzymes. Frequently tradeoffs are observed, where improvements in some features can come at the expense of others. Nature uses modular assembly of active sites for complex, multi&#8208;step reactions, and natural &#8220;swing arm&#8221; mechanisms have evolved to transfer intermediates between active sites. Biomimetic polyethylene glycol (PEG) swing arms modified with NAD(H) have been explored to introduce synthetic swing arms into fused oxidoreductases. Here we report that increasing NAD(H)&#8208;PEG swing arms can improve the activity of synthetic formate:malate oxidoreductases as well as the thermal and operational stabilities of the biocatalysts. The modular assembly approach enables the KM values of new enzymes to be predictable, based on the parental enzymes. We describe four unique synthetic transhydrogenases that have no native homologs, and this platform could be easily extended for the predictive design of additional synthetic cofactor&#8208;independent transhydrogenases.

The modular assembly of synthetic transhydrogenase catalysts is demonstrated using a PEG&#8208;NAD(H) modified formate dehydrogenase (FDH)&#8208;SpyCatcher fusion protein. The front cover highlights how any oxidoreductase enzyme can be outfitted with a simple SpyTag peptide and conjugated to FDH&#8208;SpyCatcher to create new cofactor&#8208;independent biocatalysts driven by formate oxidation. The stabilities and catalytic properties of the resulting transhydrogenases are improved without detriment to the selectivities of the native active sites, emphasizing the functional modularity and predictive nature of this synthetic approach to biocatalyst design.

         <dc:description>
P450s have attracted increasing attention in synthetic biology and biotechnology. To leverage their catalytic efficiency, different strategies have been developed including substrate engineering, allosteric effectors, decoy&#8208;based small molecules, artificial enzyme cascades, one&#8208;pot multienzyme reactions (OPME), and enzyme&#8208;materials hybridization. These research efforts also have important implications for the study of other enzymes and many fields of application. More information can be found in the Minireview by L. Zhang and Q. Wang.

         <title>Harnessing P450 Enzyme for Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 3, February 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
P450s have attracted increasing attentions in the synthetic biology and biotechnology areas due to their versatile functions and unique structures. In this article, different strategies that used to leverage P450s catalytic efficiency have been reviewed and discussed, which include substrate engineering, allostery effectors, decoy&#8208;based small molecules, artificial enzyme cascades, OPME and enzyme&#8208;materials hybridization etc.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s, CYPs) catalyze the oxidative transformation of a wide range of organic substrates. Their functions are crucial to xenobiotic metabolism and steroid transformation in humans and other organisms. The enzymes are promising for synthetic biology applications but limited by several drawbacks including low turnover rates, poor stability, the dependance of expensive cofactors and redox partners, and the narrow substrate scope. To conquer these obstacles, emerging strategies including substrate engineering, usage of decoy and decoy&#8208;based small molecules auxiliaries, designing of artificial enzyme cascades and the incorporation of materials have been explored based on the unique properties of P450s. These strategies can be applied to a wide range of P450s and can be combined with protein engineering to improve the enzymatic activities. This minireview will focus on some recent developments of these strategies which have been used to leverage P450 catalysis. Remaining challenges and future opportunities will also be discussed.

         <title>Recent Advances in Hydrogen Peroxide Responsive Organoborons for Biological and Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 3, February 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elevated H2O2 has been observed under various disease conditions. Due to the chemoselective reaction between boron functional groups and H2O2, numerous deactivated organoborons have been developed for H2O2&#8208;mediated activation to form an active hydroxyl product. These include H2O2 bioimaging probes and H2O2&#8208;responsive metal&#8208;prochelators, prodrugs, and theranostic agents.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide is the most stable reactive oxygen species generated endogenously, participating in numerous physiological processes and abnormal pathological conditions. Mounting evidence suggests that a higher level of H2O2 exists in various disease conditions. Thus, H2O2 functions as an ideal target for site&#8208;specific bioimaging and therapeutic targeting. The unique reactivity of organoborons with H2O2 provides a method for developing chemoselective molecules for biological and biomedical applications. This review highlights the design and application of boron&#8208;derived molecules for H2O2 detection, and the utility of boron moieties toward masking reactive compounds leading to the development of metal prochelators and prodrugs for selectively delivering an active species at the target sites with elevated H2O2 levels. Additionally, the emergence of H2O2&#8208;responsive theranostic agents consisting of both therapeutic and diagnostic moieties in one integrated system are discussed. The purpose of this review is to provide a better understanding of the role of boron&#8208;derived molecules toward biological and pharmacological applications.

         <title>The Diverse Antimicrobial Activities of Human Milk Oligosaccharides against Group B Streptococcus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 3, February 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) exert various activities against Group B Streptococcus (GBS) including inhibition of bacterial growth, enhanced penetrance, and efficacy of antibiotics via bacterial cell permeabilization, and inhibition of bacterial biofilm formation. This review discusses the most recent studies on the interaction between HMOs and GBS.







Abstract
Streptococcus agalactiae or Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a Gram&#8208;positive bacterial pathobiont that is the etiological cause of severe perinatal infections. GBS can colonize the vagina of pregnant patients and invade tissues causing ascending infections of the gravid reproductive tract that lead to adverse outcomes including preterm birth, neonatal sepsis, and maternal or fetal demise. Additionally, transmission of GBS during labor or breastfeeding can also cause invasive infections of neonates and infants. However, human milk has also been shown to have protective effects against infection; a characteristic that is likely derived from antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties of molecules that comprise human milk. Recent evidence suggests that human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), short&#8208;chain sugars that comprise 8&#8211;20&#8201;% of breast milk, have antimicrobial and anti&#8208;biofilm activity against GBS and other bacterial pathogens. Additionally, HMOs have been shown to potentiate the activity of antibiotics against GBS. This review presents the most recent published work that studies the interaction between HMOs and GBS.

         <title>Chemical Regulation of the Protein Quality Control E3 Ubiquitin Ligase C&#8208;Terminus of Hsc70 Interacting Protein (CHIP)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Identification of a CHIP inhibitor: CHIP is a protein quality control E3 ubiquitin&#8208;ligase that has been implicated in numerous diseases. Here we identified an inhibitor of CHIP and revealed that allosteric regulation of CHIP may be one way to regulate its activity.







Abstract
The ubiquitin ligase C&#8208;terminus of Hsc70 interacting protein (CHIP) is an important regulator of proteostasis. Despite playing an important role in maintaining proteostasis, little progress has been made in developing small molecules that regulate ubiquitin transfer by CHIP. Here we used differential scanning fluorimetry to identify compounds that bound CHIP. Compounds that bound CHIP were then analyzed by quantitative ubiquitination assays to identify those that altered CHIP function. One compound, MS.001, inhibited both the chaperone binding and ubiquitin ligase activity of CHIP at low micromolar concentrations. Interestingly, we found that MS.001 did not have activity against isolated U&#8208;box or tetratricopeptide (TPR) domains, but instead only inhibited full&#8208;length CHIP. Using in silico docking we identified a potential MS.001 binding site on the linker domain of CHIP and mutation of this site rendered CHIP resistant to MS.001. Together our data identify an inhibitor of the E3 ligase CHIP and provides insight into the development of compounds that regulate CHIP activity.

         <title>Strategies for Interference of Insulin Fibrillogenesis: Challenges and Advances</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite of the fact that the world is celebrating the 100th year of the discovery of insulin, advancement in the domain of insulin stabilization remains unsaturated. An efficient, simpler, and an economically favorable solution is always welcome. This review will be useful for a broad range of researchers working in the development of aggregation&#8208;free insulin formulations or insulin analogues.







Abstract
The discovery of insulin came with very high hopes for diabetic patients. In 2021, the world celebrated the 100th anniversary of the discovery of this vital hormone. However, external use of insulin is highly affected by its aggregating tendency that occurs during its manufacturing, transportation, and improper handling which ultimately leads to its pharmaceutically and biologically ineffective form. In this review, we aim to discuss the various approaches used for decelerating insulin aggregation which results in the enhancement of its overall structural stability and usage. The approaches that are discussed are broadly classified as either a measure through excipient additions or by intrinsic modifications in the insulin native structure.

         <title>Generation and Characterization of Site&#8208;Specifically Mono&#8208;Ubiquitylated p53</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ubiquitin (Ub) system (E1, E2, E3) ubiquitylates the tumor suppressor p53 thereby affecting different p53 properties including interaction with DNA and other proteins. However, as p53 is ubiquitylated at several lysine residues, it remains unclear, if and how distinct p53 properties are affected by site&#8208;specific ubiquitylation. To address this pertinent question, oxime ligation was employed to generate site&#8208;specifically mono&#8208;ubiquitylated p53.







Abstract
The tumor suppressor p53 is regulated by various posttranslational modifications including different types of ubiquitylation, which exert distinct effects on p53. While modification by ubiquitin chains targets p53 for degradation, attachment of single ubiquitin moieties (mono&#8208;ubiquitylation) affects the intracellular location of p53 and/or its interaction with chromatin. However, how this is achieved at the molecular level remains largely unknown. Similarly, since p53 can be ubiquitylated at different lysine residues, it remains unclear if the eventual effect depends on the position of the lysine modified. Here, we combined genetic code expansion with oxime ligation to generate p53 site&#8208;specifically mono&#8208;ubiquitylated at position 120. We found that mono&#8208;ubiquitylation at this position neither interferes with p53 ubiquitylation by the E3 ligases HDM2 and E6AP in complex with the viral E6 oncoprotein nor affects p53 binding to a cognate DNA sequence. Thus, ubiquitylation per se does not affect physiologically relevant properties of p53.

         <title>Immobilization of the Aspartate Ammonia&#8208;lyase from Pseudomonas fluorescens R124 on Magnetic Nanoparticles &#8722; Characterization and Kinetics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aspartate ammonia&#8208;lyases (AALs) catalyze the non&#8208;oxidative elimination of ammonia from  l&#8208;aspartate to result fumarate and ammonia. In this work the AAL coding gene from  Pseudomonas fluorescens  R124 was identified, isolated, and cloned into pET&#8208;15b expression vector and expressed in  E. coli  . The purified enzyme (PfAAL) showed optimal activity at pH 8.8, Michaelis&#8208;Menten kinetics in the ammonia elimination from  l&#8208;aspartate, and no strong dependence on divalent metal ions for its activity. The purified PfAAL was covalently immobilized on epoxy&#8208;functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (MNP), and effective kinetics of the immobilized PfAAL&#8208;MNP was compared to the native solution form. Glycerol addition significantly enhanced the storability of PfAAL&#8208;MNP. Inhibiting effect of the growing viscosity (modulated by addition of glycerol or glucose) on the enzymatic activity was observed for the native and immobilized form of PfAAL, as previously described for other free enzymes. The storage stability and recyclability of PfAAL&#8208;MNP is promising for further biocatalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping the conformational landscape of the neutral network of RNA sequences that connect two functional distinctly different ribozymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During evolution of an RNA world, the development of enzymatic function was essential. Such enzymatic function was linked to RNA sequences capable of adopting specific RNA folds that possess catalytic pockets to promote catalysis. Within this primordial RNA world, initially evolved self&#8208;replicating ribozymes presumably mutated to ribozymes with new functions. In 2000, Schultes and Bartel  investigated such conversion from one ribozyme to a new ribozyme with distinctly different catalytic functions. Within a neutral network that linked these two prototype ribozymes, a single RNA chain could be identified that exhibited both enzymatic functions. This system serves as a paradigm for an evolutionary system that allows neutral drifts by stepwise mutation from one ribozyme into a different ribozyme without loss of intermittent function. Here, we investigated this complex functional diversification by analyzing several RNA sequences within this neutral network between two ribozymes with class III ligase activity and with self&#8208;cleavage reactivity. We utilized rapid RNA sample preparation for NMR spectroscopic studies together with SHAPE analysis and in&#8208;line probing to characterize secondary structure changes within the neutral network. Our investigations allowed delineation of the 2  nd  structure space and by comparison with the previously determined catalytic function allowed correlation of the structure&#8208;function relation of ribozyme function in this neutral network.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge Matters: Mutations in Omicron Variant Favor Binding to Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Because of the mutations present in the Omicron variant, the surface of the spike protein is highly positively charged. For binding of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 to host cells, electrostatic interactions with heparan sulfate polyglycerols covering the cell surface play an essential role. Molecular dynamic simulation reveals that the interaction of the Omicron spike with polysulfates is much stronger than that of the wild type. We surmise that this enhanced interaction favors binding of Omicron and therefore subsequent cell entry and infection.







Abstract
Evidence is strengthening to suggest that the novel SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 mutant Omicron, with its more than 60 mutations, will spread and dominate worldwide. Although the mutations in the spike protein are known, the molecular basis for why the additional mutations in the spike protein that have not previously occurred account for Omicron's higher infection potential, is not understood. We propose, based on chemical rational and molecular dynamics simulations, that the elevated occurrence of positively charged amino acids in certain domains of the spike protein (Delta: +4; Omicron: +5 vs. wild type) increases binding to cellular polyanionic receptors, such as heparan sulfate due to multivalent charge&#8208;charge interactions. This observation is a starting point for targeted drug development.

         <title>Enantiocomplementary Michael Additions of Acetaldehyde to Aliphatic Nitroalkenes Catalyzed by Proline&#8208;Based Carboligases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiocomplementary Michael additions: The application of two tailor&#8208;made enantiocomplementary carboligases allow for the stereodivergent synthesis of aliphatic &#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes, which are useful precursors for pharmaceutically active analogues of the blockbuster drug, Pregabalin. Good isolated product yields and excellent enantiopurity (up to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 e.r.) were achieved.







Abstract
The blockbuster drug Pregabalin is widely prescribed for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy. Given the continuous epidemic growth of diabetes, the development of sustainable synthesis routes for Pregabalin and structurally related pharmaceutically active &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) derivatives is of high interest. Enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes are versatile synthons for the production of GABA derivatives, which can be prepared through a Michael&#8208;type addition of acetaldehyde to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitroalkenes. Here we report that tailored variants of the promiscuous enzyme 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) can accept diverse aliphatic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitroalkenes as substrates for acetaldehyde addition. Highly enantioenriched aliphatic (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes were obtained in good yields using two enantiocomplementary 4&#8208;OT variants. Our results underscore the synthetic potential of 4&#8208;OT for the preparation of structurally diverse synthons for bioactive analogues of Pregabalin.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Recognition&#8208;Initiated Exponential Amplification Reaction (PRIEAR) and Its Application in Clinical Diagnosis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein&#8208;recognition&#8208;initiated exponential amplification reaction (PRIEAR) using protein recognition to induce DNA assembly is reported. This technology converts protein recognition events into ssDNA amplicons and combines two&#8208;stage amplification to achieve exponential amplification. Diverse biomarkers can be quantified at sub&#8208;picomolar concentrations by using PRIEAR.







Abstract
Isothermal exponential amplification technology has rarely been fabricated as a universal sensing platform for the detection of proteins. To broaden their application, we have developed a strategy, named protein&#8208;recognition&#8208;initiated exponential amplification reaction (PRIEAR) using protein recognition to induce DNA assembly, which converts protein recognition events into ssDNA amplicons and combines two&#8208;stage amplification to achieve exponential amplification. Taking advantage of this principle, diverse biomarkers can be quantified at sub&#8208;picomolar concentrations in a homogenous manner, making PRIEAR suitable for clinical settings. Therefore, this strategy can expand the powerful isothermal exponential amplification technology to protein targets and thus provide a new toolbox in clinical and biomedical applications.

         <title>Rippled Sheets: The Early Polyglycine Days and Recent Developments in Nylons</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brief historical account of rippled sheets is presented. The simplest rippled sheet is that of the achiral polyglycine I. It may also exist as a metastable structure of some nylons.







Abstract
The rippled sheet structure is a remarkable insight due to Pauling and Corey, that supplements the pleated sheet structure of homochiral proteins introduced in 1951. Whereas the pleated sheet was immediately adopted by the scientific community, the rippled sheet has remained more confidential since it applies only to blends of poly(L&#8208;peptides) and poly(D&#8208;peptides). The present account tells the intimate but patchy relationship developed by the author with the rippled sheet. In the 1970s, twenty years after Pauling and Corey's proposal, the rippled sheet was recognized as a valid model for the sheet structure of the achiral polyglycine, polyglycine I, which helped improve the structure of Bombyx mori silk fibroin. Very recently, pleated and rippled sheets were found to account for unsolved crystal structures of a variety of nylons. These structures help to explain a mysterious high temperature &#8220;Brill transition&#8221; first reported in nylon 6&#8211;6 by Brill in 1942.

         <title>The Catalytic Mechanism of Pdx2 Glutaminase Driven by a Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Glu Triad: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomistic description of Pdx2 catalytic mechanism is provided by QM/MM methodologies. Pdx2, the glutaminase subunit of pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP) synthase, is characterized by a Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Glu catalytic triad used to deaminate glutamine to glutamate. While being absent in humans, Pdx2 is essential for the development and replication of the protozoan Plasmodium falciparum and Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogens, which are responsible for two deadly diseases, malaria and tuberculosis, respectively. Pdx2 is thus a promising drug target for fighting these diseases. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A.&#8197;F. Pina et&#8197;al.

         <title>Solid&#8208;phase Synthesis and Application of a Clickable Version of Epoxomicin for Proteasome Activity Analysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Degradation of proteins by the proteasome is an essential cellular process and one that many wish to study in a variety of disease types. There are commercially available probes that can monitor proteasome activity in cells, but they typically contain common fluorophores that limit their simultaneous use with other activity&#8208;based probes. In order to exchange the fluorophore or incorporate an enrichment tag, the proteasome probe likely has to be synthesized which can be cumbersome . Here, we describe a simple synthetic procedure that only requires one purification step to generate epoxomicin, a selective proteasome inhibitor, with a terminal alkyne. Through a copper&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition, any moiety containing an azide can be incorporated into the probe. Many fluorophores are commercially available that contain an azide that can be &#8220;clicked&#8221;, allowing this proteasome activity probe to be included into already established assays to monitor both proteasome activity and other cellular activities of interest.</dc:description>

         <title>NMR Data&#8208;Driven Docking of HDM2&#8208;Inhibitor Complexes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present an automated NMR&#8208;guided docking workflow that can be used to generate models of protein&#8208;ligand complexes based on data from NOE NMR experiments. The first step is to generate a number of intermolecular distance constraints from experimental NOE data. Then, the ligand is docked on an ensemble of receptor structures to account for protein flexibility, and multiple poses are generated. Finally, we use the NOE&#8208;based constraints to filter and score docking poses based on the percentage of NOE constraints that are consistent with protein&#8208;ligand interatomic distances. This workflow was successfully used during a Lead Optimization project to generate models of synthetic PPI inhibitors bound to the HDM2 protein.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We present an automated NMR-guided docking workflow that can be used to generate models of protein-ligand complexes based on data from NOE NMR experiments. The first step is to generate a number of intermolecular distance constraints from experimental NOE data. Then, the ligand is docked on an ensemble of receptor structures to account for protein flexibility, and multiple poses are generated. Finally, we use the NOE-based constraints to filter and score docking poses based on the percentage of NOE constraints that are consistent with protein-ligand interatomic distances. This workflow was successfully used during a Lead Optimization project to generate models of synthetic PPI inhibitors bound to the HDM2 protein.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improving Structural Stability and Anticoagulant Activity of a Thrombin Binding Aptamer by Aromatic Modifications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thrombin&#8208;binding aptamer (TBA) forms a chair&#8208;like G&#8208;quadruplex that shows anticoagulant properties by interacting with thrombin. Modification of TBA with aromatic chromophores is shown to improve the quadruplex stability and thrombin binding affinity. The best results were obtained for the addition of a single PDI unit, which increases the thermal stability (&#916;Tm=+18.2&#8201;&#176;C) and anticoagulant ability of the aptamer.







Abstract
The thrombin binding aptamer (TBA) is a 15&#8208;mer DNA oligonucleotide (5&#8242;&#8208;GGT TGG TGT GGT TGG&#8208;3&#8242;), that can form a stable intramolecular antiparallel chair&#8208;like G&#8208;quadruplex structure. This aptamer shows anticoagulant properties by interacting with one of the two anion binding sites of thrombin, namely the fibrinogen&#8208;recognition exosite. Here, we demonstrate that terminal modification of TBA with aromatic fragments such as coumarin, pyrene and perylene diimide (PDI), improves the G&#8208;quadruplex stability. The large aromatic surface of these dyes can &#960;&#8208;&#960; stack to the G&#8208;quadruplex or to each other, thereby stabilizing the aptamer. With respect to the original TBA, monoPDI&#8208;functionalized TBA exhibited the most remarkable improvement in melting temperature (&#916;Tm&#8776;+18&#8201;&#176;C) and displayed enhanced anticoagulant activity.

         <title>Opportunities for expanding encoded chemical diversification and improving hit enrichment in mRNA&#8208;displayed peptide libraries</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;encoded small&#8208;molecule libraries and mRNA displayed peptide libraries both use numerically large pools of oligonucleotide&#8208;tagged molecules to identify potential hits for protein targets. They differ dramatically, however, in the &#8216;drug&#8208;likeness&#8217; of the molecules that each can be used to discover. We give here an overview of the two techniques, comparing some advantages and disadvantages of each, and suggest areas where particularly mRNA display can benefit from adopting advances developed with DNA&#8208;encoded small molecule libraries. We outline cases where chemical modification of the peptide library has already been used in mRNA display, and survey opportunities to expand this using examples from DNA&#8208;encoded small molecule libraries. We also propose potential opportunities for encoding such reactions within the mRNA/cDNA tag of an mRNA&#8208;displayed peptide library to allow a more diversity&#8208;oriented approach to library modification. Finally, we outline alternate approaches for enriching target&#8208;binding hits from a pooled and tagged library, and close by detailing several examples of how an adjusted mRNA&#8208;display based approach could be used to discover new &#8216;drug&#8208;like&#8217; modified small peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Stress in Cancer Therapy: Friend or Enemy?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative stress and the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells is described in this review, followed by discussion of the therapeutic strategies focused on ROS levels for cancer therapy. Clinically approved drugs with oxidative stress anticancer mechanisms of action are described and examples of metal&#8208;based anticancer drug candidates with such mechanisms of action are highlighted.







Abstract
Excessive cellular oxidative stress is widely perceived as a key factor in pathophysiological conditions and cancer development. Healthy cells use several mechanisms to maintain intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and overall redox homeostasis to avoid damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids. Cancer cells, in contrast, exhibit elevated ROS levels and upregulated protective antioxidant pathways. Counterintuitively, such elevated oxidative stress and enhanced antioxidant defence mechanisms in cancer cells provide a therapeutic opportunity for the development of drugs with different anticancer mechanisms of action (MoA). In this review, oxidative stress and the role of ROS in cells are described. The tumour&#8208;suppressive and tumour&#8208;promotive functions of ROS are discussed, and these two different therapeutic strategies (increasing or decreasing ROS to fight cancer) are compared. Clinically approved drugs with demonstrated oxidative stress anticancer MoAs are highlighted followed by description of examples of metal&#8208;based anticancer drug candidates causing oxidative stress in cancer cells via novel MoAs.

         <title>Biocatalytic Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Promising Materials for Biosensing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with porous networks and attractive functions have been intelligently employed as supports to encase enzymes and protect them against harsh environments. More importantly, customizable construction and composition affords the intrinsic enzyme&#8208;like activity of some MOFs (known as nanozymes), which provides an alternative guideline for constructing robust enzyme mimics. This review will introduce the concept of these biocatalytic MOFs, with special emphasis on how the biocatalytic processes operate in these materials can reverse the plight of native enzyme&#8208;based biosensing.

The highly efficient and specific catalysis of enzymes allows them to recognize a myriad of substrates, which enables biosensing. However, the fragility of natural enzymes severely restricts their practical applications.

         <title>A Peroxygenase&#8208;Alcohol Dehydrogenase Cascade Reaction to Transform Ethylbenzene Derivatives into Enantioenriched Phenylethanols</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bienzymatic cascade to access complementary chiral phenylethanols from simple ethylbenzene derivatives is presented, combining peroxygenase&#8208;catalysed oxyfunctionalisation to the corresponding acetophenone with alcohol dehydrogenase&#8208;catalysed enantioselective reduction.







Abstract
In this study, we developed a new bienzymatic reaction to produce enantioenriched phenylethanols. In a first step, the recombinant, unspecific peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita (rAaeUPO) was used to oxidise ethylbenzene and its derivatives to the corresponding ketones (prochiral intermediates) followed by enantioselective reduction into the desired (R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;phenylethanols using the (R)&#8208;selective alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) from Lactobacillus kefir (LkADH) or the (S)&#8208;selective ADH from Rhodococcus ruber (ADH&#8208;A). In a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step cascade, 11 ethylbenzene derivatives were converted into the corresponding chiral alcohols at acceptable yields and often excellent enantioselectivity.

         <title>Serum Compatible Spermine&#8208;Based Cationic Lipids with Nonidentical Hydrocarbon Tails Mediate High Transfection Efficiency</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
L&#8208;shaped spermine&#8208;based cationic lipids with nonidentical hydrophobic chains showed excellent transfection efficiency under serum&#8208;free and 10&#8211;40&#8201;% serum conditions when compared with the commercially available transfection agent, Lipofectamine3000.







Abstract
Cationic lipids are widely used as nonviral synthetic vectors for gene delivery as a safer alternative to viral vectors. In this work, a library of L&#8208;shaped spermine&#8208;based cationic lipids with identical and nonidentical hydrophobic chains having variable carbon lengths (from C10 to C18) was designed and synthesized. These lipids were characterized and the structure&#8208;activity relationships of these compounds were determined for DNA binding and transfection ability when formulated as cationic liposomes. The liposomes were then used successfully for the transfection of HEK293T, HeLa, PC3, H460, HepG2, SH&#8208;SY5Y and Calu&#8217;3&#8197;cell lines. The transfection efficiency of lipids with nonidentical hydrocarbon chains was greater than the identical analogue. These reagents exhibited superior efficiency to the commercial reagent, Lipofectamine3000, under both serum&#8208;free and 10&#8211;40&#8201;% serum conditions in HEK293T, HeLa and H460&#8197;cell lines. The lipids were not toxic to the tested cell line. The results suggest that L&#8208;shaped spermine&#8208;based cationic lipids with nonidentical hydrocarbon tails could serve as efficient and safe nonviral vector gene carriers in further in&#8197;vivo studies.

Readily available N6&#8208;(N&#8208;Boc&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminoacyl)&#8208;adenosines were used in Tf2O&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization to hydantoin&#8208;modified units.

Abstract
A novel and efficient way for the synthesis of N6&#8208;hydantoin&#8208;modified adenosines, which utilizes readily available N6&#8208;(N&#8208;Boc&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminoacyl)&#8208;adenosine derivatives, was developed. The procedure is based on the epimerization&#8208;free, Tf2O&#8208;mediated conversion of the Boc group into an isocyanate moiety, followed by intramolecular cyclization. Using this method two recently discovered hydantoin modified tRNA adenosines, that is, cyclic N6&#8208;threonylcarbamoyl&#8208;adenosine (ct6A) and 2&#8208;methylthio&#8208;N6&#8208;threonylcarbamoyladenosine (ms2ct6A) were prepared in good yields.

         <title>Modern Strategies for the Diversification of the Supply of Natural Compounds: The Case of Alkaloid Painkillers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alkaloid pharmaceuticals supply&#8208;chain is highly dependent on opium poppy harvest. The biosynthesis of alkaloid painkillers encounters its first bottleneck in the enzymatic Pictet&#8208;Spengler stereoselective condensation of 4&#8208;HPAA and dopamine, to synthesize S&#8208;norcoclaurine. The enzyme mechanisms and possible methodology for the improvement of their efficiency are discussed in this review.







Abstract
Plant&#8208;derived natural compounds have been used for treating diseases since prehistorical times. The supply of many plant&#8208;derived natural compounds for medicinal purposes, such as thebaine, morphine, and codeine, is primarily dependent on opium poppy crop harvesting. This dependency adds an extra risk factor to ensuring the supply chain because crops are highly susceptible to environmental conditions. Emerging technologies, such as biocatalysis, might help to solve this problem by diversifying the sources of supply of these compounds. Here we review the first committed step in the production of alkaloid painkillers, the production of S&#8208;norcoclaurine, and the enzymes involved. The improvement of these enzymes can be carried out experimentally by directed evolution and rational design strategies, supported by computational methods, to create variants that produce the S&#8208;norcoclaurine precursor for alkaloid painkillers in heterologous organisms, meeting the pharmaceutical industry standards and needs without depending on opium poppy crops.

         <title>Molecular Determinants of Carbocation Cyclisation in Bacterial Monoterpene Synthases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active site residues in terpene synthases each have a unique and precise function in guiding the reactive carbocation intermediates to the final product. Here we used a combined experimental and computational approach to unravel the role of several active site residues in bacterial monoterpene synthases. These residues are often not conserved even in closely related enzymes demonstrating the importance of a tailored active site for each terpene product.







Abstract
Monoterpene synthases are often promiscuous enzymes, yielding product mixtures rather than pure compounds due to the nature of the branched reaction mechanism involving reactive carbocations. Two previously identified bacterial monoterpene synthases, a linalool synthase (bLinS) and a cineole synthase (bCinS), produce nearly pure linalool and cineole from geranyl diphosphate, respectively. We used a combined experimental and computational approach to identify critical residues involved in bacterial monoterpenoid synthesis. Phe77 is essential for bCinS activity, guiding the linear carbocation intermediate towards the formation of the cyclic &#945;&#8208;terpinyl intermediate; removal of the aromatic ring results in variants that produce acyclic products only. Computational chemistry confirmed the importance of Phe77 in carbocation stabilisation. Phe74, Phe78 and Phe179 are involved in maintaining the active site shape in bCinS without a specific role for the aromatic ring. Phe295 in bLinS, and the equivalent Ala301 in bCinS, are essential for linalool and cineole formation, respectively. Where Phe295 places steric constraints on the carbocation intermediates, Ala301 is essential for bCinS initial cyclisation and activity. Our multidisciplinary approach gives unique insights into how carefully placed amino acid residues in the active site can direct carbocations down specific paths, by placing steric constraints or offering stabilisation via cation&#8208;&#960; interactions.

         <title>Engineering the Ligand Specificity of the Human Galectin&#8208;1 by Incorporation of Tryptophan Analogues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tryptophan analogues tailor lectin specificity: Atomic mutations introduced at the single tryptophan residue in the galectin&#8208;1 carbohydrate binding site reduce the affinity for selected, sulfated ligands without substantially affecting the interaction with other sugars. Molecular modeling traces this change in affinity back to altered solvation patterns, modulated CH&#8208;&#960; interactions, and electrostatic repulsion between the sulfated ligands and the introduced fluorine as well as nitrogen atoms.







Abstract
Galectin&#8208;1 is a &#946;&#8208;galactoside&#8208;binding lectin with manifold biological functions. A single tryptophan residue (W68) in its carbohydrate binding site plays a major role in ligand binding and is highly conserved among galectins. To fine tune galectin&#8208;1 specificity, we introduced several non&#8208;canonical tryptophan analogues at this position of human galectin&#8208;1 and analyzed the resulting variants using glycan microarrays. Two variants containing 7&#8208;azatryptophan and 7&#8208;fluorotryptophan showed a reduced affinity for 3&#8217;&#8208;sulfated oligosaccharides. Their interaction with different ligands was further analyzed by fluorescence polarization competition assay. Using molecular modeling we provide structural clues that the change in affinities comes from modulated interactions and solvation patterns. Thus, we show that the introduction of subtle atomic mutations in the ligand binding site of galectin&#8208;1 is an attractive approach for fine&#8208;tuning its interactions with different ligands.

&lt;p&gt;Galectin-1 is a &#946;-galactoside-binding lectin with manifold biological functions. A single tryptophan residue (W68) in its carbohydrate binding site plays a major role in ligand binding and is highly conserved among galectins. To fine tune galectin-1 specificity, we introduced several non-canonical tryptophan analogues at this position of human galectin-1 and analyzed the resulting variants using glycan microarrays. Two variants containing 7-azatryptophan and 7-fluorotryptophan showed a reduced affinity for 3&#8217;-sulfated oligosaccharides. Their interaction with different ligands was further analyzed by fluorescence polarization competition assay. Using molecular modeling we provide structural clues that the change in affinities comes from modulated interactions and solvation patterns. Thus, we show that the introduction of subtle atomic mutations in the ligand binding site of galectin-1 is an attractive approach for fine-tuning its interactions with different ligands.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Characterization of competitive inhibitors of P. falciparum cGMP&#8208;dependent protein kinase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>P. falciparum  cGMP&#8208;dependent protein kinase (PfPKG) is an enticing anti&#8208;malarial drug target. Novel chemotypes are needed because existing inhibitors have safety issues that may prevent further development. This work demonstrates isoxazole&#8208;based compounds are potent ATP competitive inhibitors of PfPKG and discloses a new analog in this series. Isoxazoles  3  and  5  had  K  i  values that are comparable to a known standard, 4&#8208;[2&#8208;(4&#8208;fluorophenyl)&#8208;5&#8208;(1&#8208;methylpiperidine&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H pyrrol&#8208;3&#8208;yl] pyridine. They also exhibited excellent selectivity for PfPKG over the human ortholog and the gatekeeper mutant T618Q PfPKG, which mimics the less accessible binding site of the human ortholog. The human ortholog&#8217;s larger binding site volume was predicted to explain the selectivity of the inhibitors for the  P. falciparum  enzyme.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Protein Enrichment in Lipid Sponge Phase Droplets using SNAP&#8208;Tag Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step SNAP&#8208;tag bioconjugation strategy for controlling protein capture in lipid sponge phase droplets is described. The approach provides a stable covalent bond between the protein of interest and the lipid bilayer of sponge droplets, enabling protein sequestration even in the presence of the complex biochemical machinery required for cell&#8208;free protein expression.







Abstract
All cells use organized lipid compartments to facilitate specific biological functions. Membrane&#8208;bound organelles create defined spatial environments that favor unique chemical reactions while isolating incompatible biological processes. Despite the fundamental role of cellular organelles, there is a scarcity of methods for preparing functional artificial lipid&#8208;based compartments. Here, we demonstrate a robust bioconjugation system for sequestering proteins into zwitterionic lipid sponge phase droplets. Incorporation of benzylguanine (BG)&#8208;modified phospholipids that form stable covalent linkages with an O6&#8208;methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (SNAP&#8208;tag) fusion protein enables programmable control of protein capture. We show that this methodology can be used to anchor hydrophilic proteins at the lipid&#8208;aqueous interface, concentrating them within an accessible but protected chemical environment. SNAP&#8208;tag technology enables the integration of proteins that regulate complex biological functions in lipid sponge phase droplets, and should facilitate the development of advanced lipid&#8208;based artificial organelles.

         <title>Selection of M2+&#8208;Independent RNA&#8208;Cleaving DNAzymes with Side&#8208;Chains Mimicking Arginine and Lysine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Take your chances: select the aces, lose the imidazole: Selection of self&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes from deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates modified with ammonium and guanidinium cations in the absence of an imidazole&#8208;modified nucleoside yielded DNAzymes that are surprisingly M2+&#8208;independent despite the presence of Mg2+ during selection. This work tests the value of leaving out an imidazole and in favor of cationic amines and guanidines to discovery RNA cleaving DNAzymes.







Abstract
Sequence&#8208;specific cleavage of RNA by nucleic acid catalysts in the absence of a divalent metal cation (M2+) has remained an important goal in biomimicry with potential therapeutic applications. Given the lack of functional group diversity in canonical nucleotides, modified nucleotides with amino acid&#8208;like side chains were used to enhance self&#8208;cleavage rates at a single embedded ribonucleoside site. Previous works relied on three functional groups: an amine, a guanidine and an imidazole ensconced on three different nucleosides. However, to date, few studies have systematically addressed the necessity of all three modifications, as the value of any single modified nucleoside is contextualized at the outset of selection. Herein, we report on the use of only two modified dNTPs, excluding an imidazole, i.&#8201;e. 5&#8208;(3&#8208;guanidinoallyl)&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;dUTP (dUgaTP) and 5&#8208;aminoallyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;dCTP (dCaaTP), to select in&#8208;vitro self&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes that cleave in the absence of M2+ in a pH&#8208;independent fashion. Cleavage shows biphasic kinetics with rate constants that are significantly higher than in unmodified DNAzymes and compare favorably to certain DNAzymes involving an imidazole.

         <dc:description>
Synthesised acetylated derivatives of N&#8208;acetylneuraminic acid, Neu5,9Ac2 and Neu4,5Ac2, alongside commercially available Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc were utilised as standards for the quantitative analysis of these derivatives in plasma and serum samples. Multiple derivatives could be detected in one assay, which exhibited high specificity and low limits of detection and quantitation.







Abstract
N&#8208;Acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid, Neu5Ac) is one of a large, diverse family of nine&#8208;carbon monosaccharides that play roles in many biological functions such as immune response. Neu5Ac has previously been identified as a potential biomarker for the presence and pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes and cancer. More recent research has highlighted acetylated sialic acid derivatives, specifically Neu5,9Ac2, as biomarkers for oral and breast cancers, but advances in analysis have been hampered due to a lack of commercially available quantitative standards. We report here the synthesis of 9&#8208;O&#8208; and 4&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated sialic acids (Neu5,9Ac2 and Neu4,5Ac2) with optimisation of previously reported synthetic routes. Neu5,9Ac2 was synthesised in 1 step in 68&#8201;% yield. Neu4,5Ac2 was synthesised in 4 steps in 39&#8201;% overall yield. Synthesis was followed by analysis of these standards via quantitative NMR (qNMR) spectroscopy. Their utilisation for the identification and quantification of specific acetylated sialic acid derivatives in biological samples is also demonstrated.

         <title>Selective Disruption of Survivin's Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions: A Supramolecular Approach Based on Guanidiniocarbonylpyrrole</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The artificial guanidiniocarbonylpyrrole (GCP) ligands LNES and LHIS target key regions of the cancer relevant protein Survivin and are both capable of reducing cancer cell proliferation.







Abstract
Targeting specific protein binding sites to interfere with protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial for the rational modulation of biologically relevant processes. Survivin, which is highly overexpressed in most cancer cells and considered to be a key player of carcinogenesis, features two functionally relevant binding sites. Here, we demonstrate selective disruption of the Survivin/Histone H3 or the Survivin/Crm1 interaction using a supramolecular approach. By rational design we identified two structurally related ligands (LNES and LHIS), capable of selectively inhibiting these PPIs, leading to a reduction in cancer cell proliferation.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The artificial&lt;/b&gt; guanidiniocarbonylpyrrole (GCP) ligands &lt;b&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;NES&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;HIS&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; target key regions of the cancer relevant protein Survivin and are both capable of reducing cancer cell proliferation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeting specific protein binding sites to interfere with protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial for the rational modulation of biologically relevant processes. Survivin, which is highly overexpressed in most cancer cells and considered to be a key player of carcinogenesis, features two functionally relevant binding sites. Here, we demonstrate selective disruption of the Survivin/Histone H3 or the Survivin/Crm1 interaction using a supramolecular approach. By rational design we identified two structurally related ligands (&lt;b&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;NES&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;HIS&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;), capable of selectively inhibiting these PPIs, leading to a reduction in cancer cell proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spectroscopic and in vitro investigations of Fe2+/&#945;&#8208;Ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent enzymes involved in nucleic acid repair and modification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activation of molecular oxygen for the highly selective functionalization and repair of DNA and RNA nucleobases is achieved by &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate (&#945;&#8208;KG)/iron&#8208;dependent dioxygenases. Enzymes of special interest are the human homologs AlkBH of  Escherichia coli  EcAlkB and ten&#8208;eleven translocation (TET) enzymes. These enzymes are involved in demethylation or dealkylation of DNA and RNA, although additional physiological functions are continuously being revealed. Given their importance, studying enzyme&#8208;substrate interactions, turnover and kinetic parameters is pivotal for the understanding of the mode of action of these enzymes. Diverse analytical methods, including X&#8208;ray crystallography, UV/Vis absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), circular dichroism (CD) and NMR spectroscopy have been employed to study the changes in the active site and the overall enzyme structure upon substrate, cofactor and inhibitor addition. Several methods are now available to assess activity of these enzymes. By discussing limitations and possibilities of these techniques for EcAlkB, AlkBH and TET we aim to give a comprehensive synopsis from a bioinorganic point of view, addressing researchers from different disciplines working in the highly interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving field of epigenetic processes and DNA/RNA repair and modification.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic and Spectroscopic Properties of the Halotolerant Soluble Methane Monooxygenase Reductase from Methylomonas methanica MC09</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reductase module of the soluble methane monooxygenase from Methylomonas methanica MC09 is catalytically active for NADH oxidation even at high salt concentrations. Spectroscopic analyses revealed one FeS cluster and FAD. During uncoupled turnover reactions, moderate levels of hydrogen peroxide were released. The characterization of this reductase is an important step for future biotechnological applications of a halotolerant sMMO.







Abstract
The soluble methane monooxygenase receives electrons from NADH via its reductase MmoC for oxidation of methane, which is itself an attractive C1 building block for a future bioeconomy. Herein, we present biochemical and spectroscopic insights into the reductase from the marine methanotroph Methylomonas methanica MC09. The presence of a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and [2Fe2S] cluster as its prosthetic group were revealed by reconstitution experiments, iron determination and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. As a true halotolerant enzyme, MmoC still showed 50&#8201;% of its specific activity at 2&#8197;M NaCl. We show that MmoC produces only trace amounts of superoxide, but mainly hydrogen peroxide during uncoupled turnover reactions. The characterization of a highly active reductase is an important step for future biotechnological applications of a halotolerant sMMO.

         <title>Effect of Amino Acid Substitutions on 70S Ribosomal Binding, Cellular Uptake, and Antimicrobial Activity of Oncocin Onc112</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The antibacterial activity of substituted oncocin Onc112 peptides varied widely among different bacterial species, which could be partially explained by ribosome binding and cellular uptake. Onc112 analogues with a higher net positive charge appeared to be more active, although their ribosome binding and uptake rates were not necessarily better suggesting a complex mode of action.







Abstract
Proline&#8208;rich antimicrobial peptides (PrAMPs) are promising candidates for the treatment of infections caused by high&#8208;priority human pathogens. Their mode of action consists of (I) passive diffusion across the outer membrane, (II) active transport through the inner membrane, and (III) inhibition of protein biosynthesis by blocking the exit tunnel of the 70S ribosome. We tested whether in vitro data on ribosomal binding and bacterial uptake could predict the antibacterial activity of PrAMPs against Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Ribosomal binding and bacterial uptake rates were measured for 47 derivatives of PrAMP Onc112 and compared to the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of each peptide. Ribosomal binding was evaluated for ribosome extracts from four Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Bacterial uptake was assessed by quantifying each peptide in the supernatants of bacterial cultures. Oncocin analogues with a higher net positive charge appeared to be more active, although their ribosome binding and uptake rates were not necessarily better than for Onc112. The data suggest a complex mode of action influenced by further factors improving or reducing the antibacterial activity, including diffusion through membranes, transport mechanism, secondary targets, off&#8208;target binding, intracellular distribution, and membrane effects. Relying only on in vitro binding and uptake data may not be sufficient for the rational development of more active analogues.

         <title>DNA Origami&#8208;Based Protein Manipulation Systems: From Function Regulation to Biological Application</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA origami creates an ideal operation panel for positioning and manipulating individual proteins with nanoscale precision. This review provides an overview of the existing DNA origami&#8208;based protein manipulation systems for protein function regulation and biological applications.







Abstract
Proteins directly participate in tremendous physiological processes and mediate a variety of cellular functions. However, precise manipulation of proteins with predefined relative position and stoichiometry for understanding protein&#8208;protein interactions and guiding cellular behaviors is still challenging. With superior programmability of DNA molecules, DNA origami technology is able to construct arbitrary nanostructures that can accurately control the arrangement of proteins with various functionalities to solve these problems. Herein, starting from the classification of DNA origami nanostructures and the category of assembled proteins, we summarize the existing DNA origami&#8208;based protein manipulation systems (PMSs), review the advances on the regulation of their functions, and discuss their applications in cellular behavior modulation and disease therapy. Moreover, the limitations and potential directions of DNA origami&#8208;based PMSs are also presented, which may offer guidance for rational construction and ingenious application.

         <title>Engineering a Carbonyl Reductase for Scalable Preparation of (S)&#8208;3&#8208;Cyclopentyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxypropanenitrile, the Key Building Block of Ruxolitinib</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational engineering of the carbonyl reductase PhADH resulted in a double mutant H93C/A139L, which enhanced the enantioselectivity toward the reduction of 3&#8208;cyclopentyl&#8208;3&#8208;ketopropanenitrile 1&#8201;a from 85&#8201;% to 99&#8201;%, as well as a 6&#8208;fold improvement in the specific activity. (S)&#8208;3&#8208;Cyclopentyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxypropanenitrile ((S)&#8208;1&#8201;b) was prepared at 200&#8197;g/L (1.5&#8197;M) substrate concentration.







Abstract
(S)&#8208;3&#8208;Cyclopentyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxypropanenitrile is the key precursor for the synthesis of ruxolitinib. The bioreduction of 3&#8208;cyclopentyl&#8208;3&#8208;ketopropanenitrile (1&#8201;a) offers an attractive method to access this important compound. A carbonyl reductase (PhADH) from Paraburkholderia hospita catalyzed the reduction of 1&#8201;a giving the (S)&#8208;alcohol (1&#8201;b) with 85&#8201;% ee. Rational engineering of PhADH resulted in a double mutant H93C/A139L, which enhanced the enantioselectivity from 85&#8201;% to &gt;98&#8201;%, as well as a 6.3&#8208;fold improvement in the specific activity. The bioreduction of 1&#8201;a was performed at 200&#8197;g/L (1.5&#8197;M) substrate concentration, leading to isolation of (S)&#8208;1&#8201;b in 91&#8201;% yield. Similarly, using this mutant enzyme, 3&#8208;cyclohexyl&#8208;3&#8208;ketopropanenitrile (2&#8201;a) and 3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;3&#8208;ketopropanenitrile (3&#8201;a) were reduced at high concentration affording the corresponding alcohols in &gt;99&#8201;% ee, and 90&#8201;% and 92&#8201;% yield, respectively.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-3-Cyclopentyl-3-hydroxypropanenitrile is the key precursor for the synthesis of ruxolitinib. The bioreduction of 3-cyclopentyl-3-ketopropanenitrile (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) offers an attractive method to access this important compound. A carbonyl reductase (PhADH) from &lt;i&gt;Paraburkholderia hospita&lt;/i&gt; catalyzed the reduction of &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; giving the (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-alcohol (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;) with 85&#8201;% ee. Rational engineering of PhADH resulted in a double mutant H93C/A139L, which enhanced the enantioselectivity from 85&#8201;% to &amp;gt;98&#8201;%, as well as a 6.3-fold improvement in the specific activity. The bioreduction of &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; was performed at 200&#8197;g/L (1.5&#8197;M) substrate concentration, leading to isolation of (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; in 91&#8201;% yield. Similarly, using this mutant enzyme, 3-cyclohexyl-3-ketopropanenitrile (&lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) and 3-phenyl-3-ketopropanenitrile (&lt;b&gt;3&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) were reduced at high concentration affording the corresponding alcohols in &amp;gt;99&#8201;% ee, and 90&#8201;% and 92&#8201;% yield, respectively. The results showed that the variant H93C/A139L was a powerful biocatalyst for reduction of &#946;-substituted-&#946;-ketonitriles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Immobilization of His&#8208;Tagged Phosphomannose Isomerase on Ni Chelated Nanoparticles with Good Reusability and Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) with His&#8208;tag was successfully immobilized on Ni2+ charged pyridine&#8208;derived particles. The immobilized enzymes effectively maintained their activity. Excellent reusability and stability was observed after immobilization.







Abstract
Self&#8208;stable precipitation polymerization was used to prepare an enzyme&#8208;immobilized microsphere composite. Phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) with His&#8208;tag was successfully immobilized on Ni2+ charged pyridine&#8208;derived particles. The maximum amount of PMI immobilized on such particles was &#8764;184&#8197;mg/g. Compared with free enzyme, the activity of the immobilized enzymes was significantly improved. In addition, the immobilized enzymes showed a much better thermostability than free enzymes. At the same time, the immobilized enzymes can be reused for multiple reaction cycles. We observed that the enzyme activity did not decrease significantly after six cycles. We conclude that the pyridine&#8208;derived particles can be used to selectively immobilize His&#8208;tagged enzymes, which can couple the enzyme purification and catalysis steps and improve the efficiency of enzyme&#8208;catalyzed industrial processes.

         <title>Titration of Apparent In&#8208;Cellula Affinities of Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using fluorescent probes, we estimate at the cellular level the fraction of Bait molecules bound by Prey molecules in a quantitative yeast&#8208;two hybrid assay. A titration&#8208;like analysis of flow cytometer data permits the extraction of the apparent in&#8208;cellula dissociation constant.







Abstract
A genetic assay permits simultaneous quantification of two interacting proteins and their bound fraction at the single&#8208;cell level using flow cytometry. Apparent in&#8208;cellula affinities of protein&#8208;protein interactions can be extracted from the acquired data through a titration&#8208;like analysis. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated on a diverse set of interactions with proteins from different families and organisms and with in&#8208;vitro dissociation constants ranging from picomolar to micromolar.

         <title>Substrate Profiling of Anion Methyltransferases for Promiscuous Synthesis of S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine Analogs from Haloalkanes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;natural analogs of the ubiquitous co&#8208;substrate S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) are difficult to access, but useful for the enzymatic functionalization of various molecules with high selectivity. We investigated the promiscuous synthesis of SAM analogs in the anion methyltransferase enzyme family. Several promiscuous enzymes have been identified that synthesize non&#8208;natural co&#8208;substrates from cheap and readily available haloalkanes. This opens new avenues for selective alkylation chemistry.







Abstract
Biocatalytic alkylation reactions can be performed with high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity using S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM)&#8208;dependent methyltransferases (MTs) and SAM analogs. Currently, however, this methodology is limited in application due to the rather laborious protocols to access SAM analogs. It has recently been shown that halide methyltransferases (HMTs) enable synthesis and recycling of SAM analogs with readily available haloalkanes as starting material. Here we expand this work by using substrate profiling of the anion MT enzyme family to explore promiscuous SAM analog synthesis. Our study shows that anion MTs are in general very promiscuous with respect to the alkyl chain as well as the halide leaving group. Substrate profiling further suggests that promiscuous anion MTs cluster in sequence space. Next to iodoalkanes, cheaper, less toxic, and more available bromoalkanes have been converted and several haloalkanes bearing short alkyl groups, alkyl rings, and functional groups such as alkene, alkyne and aromatic moieties are accepted as substrates. Further, we applied the SAM analogs as electrophiles in enzyme&#8208;catalyzed regioselective pyrazole allylation with 3&#8208;bromopropene as starting material.

         <title>Semi&#8208;rational Engineering of a Promiscuous Fatty Acid Hydratase for Alteration of Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semi&#8208;rational mutant library of a promiscuous fatty acid hydrtatase (FA&#8208;HY1) revealed several mutants, which exhibited an impressive shift of regioselectivity towards eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) substrate. While the wild&#8208;type enzyme produces a mixture of two hydroxy fatty acid regioisomers at a ratio of 63&#8201;:&#8201;37 (12&#8208;OH&#8201;:&#8201;15&#8208;OH), six mutants were able to form exclusively a single hydroxy fatty acid regioisomer (15&#8208;OH).







Abstract
Fatty acid hydratases (FAHs) catalyze regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective hydration of unsaturated fatty acids to produce hydroxy fatty acids. Fatty acid hydratase&#8208;1 (FA&#8208;HY1) from Lactobacillus Acidophilus is the most promiscuous and regiodiverse FAH identified so far. Here, we engineered binding site residues of FA&#8208;HY1 (S393, S395, S218 and P380) by semi&#8208;rational protein engineering to alter regioselectivity. Although it was not possible to obtain a completely new type of regioselectivity with our mutant libraries, a significant shift of regioselectivity was observed towards cis&#8208;5, cis&#8208;8, cis&#8208;11, cis&#8208;14, cis&#8208;17&#8208;eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). We identified mutants (S393/S395 mutants) with excellent regioselectivity, generating a single hydroxy fatty acid product from EPA (15&#8208;OH product), which is advantageous from application perspective. This result is impressive given that wild&#8208;type FA&#8208;HY1 produces a mixture of 12&#8208;OH and 15&#8208;OH products at 63&#8201;:&#8201;37 ratio (12&#8208;OH&#8201;:&#8201;15&#8208;OH). Moreover, our results indicate that native FA&#8208;HY1 is at its limit in terms of promiscuity and regiospecificity, thus it may not be possible to diversify its product portfolio with active site engineering. This behavior of FA&#8208;HY1 is unlike its orthologue, fatty acid hydratase&#8208;2 (FA&#8208;HY2; 58&#8201;% sequence identity to FA&#8208;HY1), which has been shown earlier to exhibit significant promiscuity and regioselectivity changes by a few active site mutations. Our reverse engineering from FA&#8208;HY1 to FA&#8208;HY2 further demonstrates this conclusion.

         <title>Rational Design of a Cu Chelator That Mitigates Cu&#8208;Induced ROS Production by Amyloid Beta</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rationally designed mixed Cu chelator mitigates Cu&#8722;A&#946; induced reactive oxygen species formation by redox silencing and radical scavenging. The presence of oxidized amino acids in A&#946; correlates to their role in the entatic state.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease severely perturbs transition metal homeostasis in the brain leading to the accumulation of excess metals in extracellular and intraneuronal locations. The amyloid beta protein binds these transition metals, ultimately causing severe oxidative stress in the brain. Metal chelation therapy is an approach to sequester metals from amyloid beta and relieve the oxidative stress. Here we have designed a mixed N/O donor Cu chelator inspired by the proposed ligand set of Cu in amyloid beta. We demonstrate that the chelator effectively removes Cu from amyloid beta and suppresses reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by redox silencing and radical scavenging both in&#8197;vitro and in cellulo. The impact of ROS on the extent of oxidation of the different aggregated forms of the peptide is studied by mass spectrometry, which, along with other ROS assays, shows that the oligomers are pro&#8208;oxidants in nature. The aliphatic Leu34, which was previously unobserved, has been identified as a new oxidation site.

         <title>Fatty Acyl Sulfonyl Fluoride as an Activity&#8208;Based Probe for Profiling Fatty Acid&#8208;Associated Proteins in Living Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alkynyl&#8208;functionalized long&#8208;chain fatty acid&#8208;based sulfonyl fluoride chemical probe was developed for covalent targeting, activity profiling, proteomic identification, and inhibitor evaluation of diverse classes of fatty acid&#8208;associated proteins in living cells.







Abstract
Fatty acids play fundamental structural, metabolic, functional, and signaling roles in all biological systems. Altered fatty acid levels and metabolism have been associated with many pathological conditions. Chemical probes have greatly facilitated biological studies on fatty acids. Herein, we report the development and characterization of an alkynyl&#8208;functionalized long&#8208;chain fatty acid&#8208;based sulfonyl fluoride probe for covalent labelling, enrichment, and identification of fatty acid&#8208;associated proteins in living cells. Our quantitative chemical proteomics show that this sulfonyl fluoride probe targets diverse classes of fatty acid&#8208;associated proteins including many metabolic serine hydrolases that are known to be involved in fatty acid metabolism and modification. We further validate that the probe covalently modifies the catalytically or functionally essential serine or tyrosine residues of its target proteins and enables evaluation of their inhibitors. The sulfonyl fluoride&#8208;based chemical probe thus represents a new tool for profiling the expression and activity of fatty acid&#8208;associated proteins in living cells.

         <title>Extension of the Terpene Chemical Space: the Very First Biosynthetic Steps</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to a unique biosynthetic scheme, the diversification of terpene structure could be envisioned through the structural modification of the two universal common terpene precursors IPP and DMAPP. This minireview covers the synthesis, the use as prenyl transferase substrates, and the synthetic application of IPP and DMAPP homologues developed for diversifying the terpene chemical space.







Abstract
The structural diversity of terpenes is particularly notable and many studies are carried out to increase it further. In the terpene biosynthetic pathway this diversity is accessible from only two common precursors, i.&#8201;e. isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). Methods recently developed (e.&#8201;g. the Terpene Mini Path) have allowed DMAPP and IPP to be obtained from a two&#8208;step enzymatic conversion of industrially available isopentenol (IOH) and dimethylallyl alcohol (DMAOH) into their corresponding diphosphates. Easily available IOH and DMAOH analogues then offer quick access to modified terpenoids thus avoiding the tedious chemical synthesis of unnatural diphosphates. The aim of this minireview is to cover the literature devoted to the use of these analogues for widening the accessible terpene chemical space.

         <title>Asymmetrically Substituted m&#8208;Terphenyl Phosphates Inhibit the Transcription Factor STAT5a</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Symmetry is overrated: Stafia&#8208;1, the first selective inhibitor of the transcription factor STAT5a, is a symmetrically substituted m&#8208;terphenyl phosphate that binds to an unsymmetrical protein binding pocket. We present synthetic methodology for generating asymmetrically substituted m&#8208;terphenyl phosphate&#8208;based STAT5a inhibitors, which give insights into structure&#8208;activity relationships.







Abstract
We recently presented Stafia&#8208;1 as the first chemical entity that inhibits the transcription factor STAT5a with selectivity over the highly homologous STAT5b. Stafia&#8208;1, which was identified from a series of symmetrically substituted m&#8208;terphenyl phosphates, binds to the interface between the SH2 domain and the linker domain of STAT5a. Here, we outline a synthetic strategy for the synthesis of asymmetrically substituted m&#8208;terphenyl phosphates, which can be tailored to address their asymmetric STAT5a binding site in a more specific manner. The asymmetrically substituted m&#8208;terphenyl phosphate with the highest activity against STAT5a was converted to a phosphatase&#8208;stable monofluoromethylene phosphonate. The synthetic methodology and activity analysis described here provide first insights into the structure&#8208;activity relationships of m&#8208;terphenyl phosphates for use as selective STAT5a inhibitors.

         <title>Monitoring the Response of Multiple Signal Network Components to Acute Chemo&#8208;Optogenetic Perturbations in Living Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical perturbation method is presented that allows parallel readout of multiple fluorescence&#8208;based response kinetics in individual, living cells. The method is used to uncover control mechanisms in cell contraction and their misregulation in disease.







Abstract
Cells process information via signal networks that typically involve multiple components which are interconnected by feedback loops. The combination of acute optogenetic perturbations and microscopy&#8208;based fluorescent response readouts enables the direct investigation of causal links in such networks. However, due to overlaps in spectra of photosensitive and fluorescent proteins, current approaches that combine these methods are limited. Here, we present an improved chemo&#8208;optogenetic approach that is based on switch&#8208;like perturbations induced by a single, local pulse of UV light. We show that this approach can be combined with parallel monitoring of multiple fluorescent readouts to directly uncover relations between signal network components. We present the application of this technique to directly investigate feedback&#8208;controlled regulation in the cell contraction signal network that includes GEF&#8208;H1, Rho and Myosin, and functional interactions of this network with tumor relevant RhoA G17 mutants.

         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An orthogonal lysine acylation and deacylation (OKAD) system, which potentially could precisely dissect the biological consequence of an individual acetylation or deacetylation event in living cells, was rationally designed through genetically encoding artificially designed acylated lysine analogues and reshaping the substrate specificity of a bacterial protein deacetylase.







Abstract
Lysine acetylation is one of the most basic molecular mechanisms to mediate protein functions in living organisms, and its abnormal regulation has been linked to many diseases. The drug development associated to this process is of great significance but severely hindered by the complex interplay of lysine acetylation and deacetylation in thousands of proteins, and we reasoned that targeting a specific protein acetylation or deacetylation event instead of the related enzymes should be a feasible solution to this issue. Toward this goal, we devised an orthogonal lysine acylation and deacylation (OKAD) system, which potentially could precisely dissect the biological consequence of an individual acetylation or deacetylation event in living cells. The system includes a genetically encoded acylated lysine (PhOAcK) that is not a substrate of endogenous deacetylases, and an evolved sirtuin (CobB2/CobB3) that displays PhOAcK deacylase activities as well as reduced deacetylase activities. We believe the strategy introduced here holds potential for future in&#8208;depth biological applications.

         <title>Bioinorganic Chemistry of Zinc in Relation to the Immune System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc's role in human immunity has been extensively covered from a biological perspective. The structural, thermodynamic, and inorganic chemistry of zinc in relation to proteins and pathways of the immune system has received less attention and is the topic of the present review.







Abstract
Zinc is well&#8208;known to have a central role in human inflammation and immunity and is itself an anti&#8208;inflammatory and antiviral agent. Despite its massively documented role in such processes, the underlying chemistry of zinc in relation to specific proteins and pathways of the immune system has not received much focus. This short review provides an overview of this topic, with emphasis on the structures of key proteins, zinc coordination chemistry, and probable mechanisms involved in zinc&#8208;based immunity, with some focus points for future chemical and biological research.

         <title>Enzymatic Beacons for Specific Sensing of Dilute Nucleic Acid**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic beacons, or E&#8208;beacons, have been prepared by hedgehog catalyzed bioconjugation and shown to function as turn&#8208;on biosensors with single&#8208;base pair mismatch specificity using SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as a sample target.







Abstract
Enzymatic beacons, or E&#8208;beacons, are 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 bioconjugates of the nanoluciferase enzyme linked covalently at its C&#8208;terminus to hairpin forming ssDNA equipped with a dark quencher. We prepared E&#8208;beacons biocatalytically using HhC, the promiscuous Hedgehog C&#8208;terminal protein&#8208;cholesterol ligase. HhC attached nanoluciferase site&#8208;specifically to mono&#8208;sterylated hairpin oligonucleotides, called steramers. Three E&#8208;beacon dark quenchers were evaluated: Iowa Black, Onyx&#8208;A, and dabcyl. Each quencher enabled sensitive, sequence&#8208;specific nucleic acid detection through enhanced E&#8208;beacon bioluminescence upon target hybridization. We assembled prototype dabcyl&#8208;quenched E&#8208;beacons specific for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Targeting the E484 codon of the virus Spike protein, E&#8208;beacons (80&#215;10&#8722;12&#8197;M) reported wild&#8208;type SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleic acid at &#8805;1&#215;10&#8722;9&#8197;M by increased bioluminescence of 8&#8208;fold. E&#8208;beacon prepared for the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 E484K variant functioned with similar sensitivity. Both E&#8208;beacons could discriminate their target from the E484Q mutation of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Kappa variant. Along with mismatch specificity, E&#8208;beacons are two to three orders of magnitude more sensitive than synthetic molecular beacons.

         <title>Creation of an Engineered Amide Synthetase Biocatalyst by the Rational Separation of a Two&#8208;Step Nitrile Synthetase</title>

Rational engineering of the ATP&#8208;dependent biocatalyst QueC converts a nitrile synthetase to an amide synthetase.







Abstract
The synthesis of amides through acid and amine coupling is one of the most commonly used reactions in medicinal chemistry, yet still requires atom&#8208;inefficient coupling reagents. There is a current demand to develop greener, biocatalytic approaches to amide bond formation. The nitrile synthetase (NS) enzymes are a small family of ATP&#8208;dependent enzymes which catalyse the transformation of a carboxylic acid into the corresponding nitrile via an amide intermediate. The Bacillus subtilis QueC (BsQueC) is an NS involved in the synthesis of 7&#8208;cyano&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine (CDG) natural products. Through sequence homology and structural analysis of BsQueC we identified three highly conserved residues, which could potentially play important roles in NS substrate binding and catalysis. Rational engineering led to the creation of a NS K163A/R204A biocatalyst that converts the CDG acid into the primary amide, but does not proceed to the nitrile. This study suggests that NSs could be further developed for coupling agent&#8208;free, amide&#8208;forming biocatalysts.

         <title>Toward Engineered Biosynthesis of Drugs in Human Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The feasibility of programming human cells to produce antibiotics in&#8197;situ by transfecting cells with a heterologous biosynthetic gene packaged in a viral vector, is demonstrated. The cytochrome P450 gene fma&#8208;P450 from the antimicrobial fumagillin biosynthetic pathway in Aspergillus fumigatus was introduced to HeLa cells to enable these human cells to biosynthesize a cytotoxic natural product from a nontoxic precursor.







Abstract
Biosynthetic genes are not only responsible for the formation of bioactive substances but also suited for other applications including gene therapy. To test the feasibility of human cells producing antibiotics in&#8197;situ when provided with a heterologous biosynthetic gene, we focused on cytochrome P450, the class of enzymes important in conferring bioactivity to natural product precursors. We selected Fma&#8208;P450 that plays a central role in the fumagillin antimicrobial biosynthesis in Aspergillus fumigatus to examine fungal metabolite production by HeLa cells that express fma&#8208;P450 heterologously. Here we show that HeLa cells harboring fma&#8208;P450 can biosynthesize 5&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;trans&#8208;bergamoten and cytotoxic 5&#8208;epi&#8208;demethoxyfumagillol when supplemented with the nontoxic precursor &#946;&#8208;trans&#8208;bergamotene. While the production level was insufficient to effect cell death, we demonstrate that programming human cells to autogenerate antibiotics by introducing a heterologous biosynthetic gene is feasible.

         <title>Enhanced Immunostimulatory Activity of Covalent DNA Dendrons</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent DNA dendrons bearing multivalent immunostimulatory CpG oligonucleotides (ODNs) have been developed. The DNA dendrons were more resistant to nuclease degradation than linear ODNs, and they enhanced the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines from RAW264.7 cells as the number of immunostimulatory branches increased, suggesting that they could induce immune response through the activation of TLR9.

The present study focused on the design and synthesis of covalent DNA dendrons bearing multivalent cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs) that can stimulate the immune system through the activation of TLR9. These dendrons were synthesized using branching trebler phosphoramidite containing three identical protecting groups that enabled the simultaneous synthesis of multiple strands on a single molecule. Compared with linear ODNs, covalent DNA dendrons were found to be more resistant to nuclease degradation and were more efficiently taken up by macrophage&#8208;like RAW264.7 cells. Cellular uptake was suggested to be mediated by macrophage scavenger receptors. The covalent DNA dendrons composed of multivalent immunostimulatory branches enhanced the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines TNF&#8208;&#945; and IL&#8208;6 from RAW264.7 cells, and 9&#8208;branched DNA dendrons showed the highest enhancement. Given their enhanced efficacy, we expect covalent DNA dendrons to be useful structures of oligonucleotide medicines.

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Hydrogel Nanoparticles: Synthetic Antibodies for Cancer Diagnosis and Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecularly imprinted polymer hydrogel nanoparticles have great potential as materials of the future in nanomedicine. We show that these synthetic antibodies can compete seriously with their biological counterparts for immunostaining of cell glycans and protein biomarkers, for targeted drug delivery, and as therapeutic agents for inhibiting cancer cell proliferation.







Abstract
Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide and according to the World Health Organization (WHO) accounted for 10 million deaths in 2020. Promising theranostic (therapy and diagnostic) agents in the treatment of cancer are nanomaterials, which have come to the forefront because of their small size approaching those of protein complexes in the human body, and of their easy functionalization giving access to nanocomposite materials with diverse functions (fluorescence, magnetic, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, etc.), and improved biocompatibility. Among them, affinity nanoparticles, often decorated with highly specific targeting ligands such as antibodies, aptamers, lectins and peptides, have enabled enhanced binding and exquisite recognition of biomarkers overexpressed in cancer cells. In this review, we describe an emerging class of targeting ligands, molecularly imprinted polymer hydrogel nanoparticles for their application in the early detection of disease, with the aim to improve diagnosis and treatment.

Abstract

Hybrid scaffolds 6&#8211;8 were synthesized at 77&#8211;95&#8201;% yields by regioselective copper&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction of unpublished 6&#8208;azido&#8208;4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)quinolines (2) with selected terminal alkynes (3&#8211;5). Azido intermediates 2 were obtained from the reaction of 6&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)quinolines (1) and sodium azide at good yields (78&#8211;87&#8201;%). Compounds 6&#8211;8 were structurally fully characterized by 1H&#8722;, 13C&#8722; and 19F&#8722; and 1H&#8722;13C 2D&#8208;NMR (HSQC, HMBC) spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) and HRMS analysis. Moreover, the photophysical properties, DNA&#8208; and HSA&#8208;binding experiments (bio&#8208;interactions), and molecular docking studies for compounds 6&#8211;8 were performed. These are discussed and compared with similar compounds from recent research.

         <title>A Conformationally Stable Acyclic &#946;&#8208;Hairpin Scaffold Tolerating the Incorporation of Poorly &#946;&#8208;Sheet&#8208;Prone Amino Acids</title>

Open but tight: Combining the d&#8208;Pro&#8208;l&#8208;Pro type II&#8242; &#946;&#8208;turn motif with cross&#8208;strand Trp/Lys(Arg) interactions leads to a conformationally and thermally highly stable &#946;&#8208;hairpin that is not sensitive to the type of residues occupying the upper face. This &#946;&#8208;hairpin scaffold is suited to accommodate a variety of amino acids, including poorly &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;prone ones, and it does not require backbone cyclization







Abstract
The &#946;&#8208;hairpin is a structural element of native proteins, but it is also a useful artificial scaffold for finding lead compounds to convert into peptidomimetics or non&#8208;peptide structures for drug discovery. Since linear peptides are synthetically more easily accessible than cyclic ones, but are structurally less well&#8208;defined, we propose XWXWXpPXK(/R)X(R) as an acyclic but still rigid &#946;&#8208;hairpin scaffold that is robust enough to accommodate different types of side chains, regardless of the secondary&#8208;structure propensity of the X residues. The high conformational stability of the scaffold results from tight contacts between cross&#8208;strand cationic and aromatic side chains, combined with the strong tendency of the d&#8208;Pro&#8208;l&#8208;Pro dipeptide to induce a type II&#8242; &#946;&#8208;turn. To demonstrate the robustness of the scaffold, we elucidated the NMR structures and performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a series of peptides displaying mainly non&#8208;&#946;&#8208;branched, poorly &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;prone residues at the X positions. Both the NMR and MD data confirm that our acyclic &#946;&#8208;hairpin scaffold is highly versatile as regards the amino&#8208;acid composition of the &#946;&#8208;sheet face opposite to the cationic&#8722;aromatic one.

         <title>One Scaffold, Different Organelle Sensors: pH&#8208;Activable Fluorescent Probes for Targeting Live Microglial Cell Organelles**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One scaffold &#8211; different organelle sensors: The structure&#8208;organelle relationship (SOR) of an important synthetic intermediate targeting the nucleus and its transformation into other pH&#8208;activable fluorescent probes is demonstrated. The fluorescent probes were synthesized using a single synthetic route. As shown in the cover picture, the assembly line illustrates that a common synthetic intermediate (rectangle shape) was transformed into another molecule (triangle or hexagonal shape) in a one&#8208;step reaction to target specific cell organelles in live microglial cells. The common intermediate targets the cell nucleus, the cationic probe targets mitochondria, whereas the amine&#8208;containing probe with pH&#8208;activable property targets acidic lysosomes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One scaffold &#8211; different organelle sensors&lt;/b&gt;: The structure-organelle relationship (SOR) of an important synthetic intermediate targeting the nucleus and its transformation into other pH-activable fluorescent probes is demonstrated. The fluorescent probes were synthesized using a single synthetic route. As shown in the cover picture, the assembly line illustrates that a common synthetic intermediate (rectangle shape) was transformed into another molecule (triangle or hexagonal shape) in a one-step reaction to target specific cell organelles in live microglial cells. The common intermediate targets the cell nucleus, the cationic probe targets mitochondria, whereas the amine-containing probe with pH-activable property targets acidic lysosomes.

         <dc:description>
The three nitrogenase isoenzymes: The molybdenum (Mo) nitrogenase, the vanadium (V) nitrogenase and the iron (Fe)&#8208;only nitrogenase, here depicted as superheroes, have a unique spectrum of activities for the reduction of molecular nitrogen (N2), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The cover feature (created by Ehmad Chehrghani Bozcheloe) summarizes this minireview: the Mo nitrogenase has the highest activity for the reduction of molecular nitrogen (N2), the V nitrogenase for the reduction of CO and the Fe&#8208;only nitrogenase for the reduction of CO2.

         <dc:description>
The right tool can do the trick: A novel thermostable benzaldehyde lyase from Rhodococcus erythropolis was identified using the computer&#8208;assisted prediction tool Tome, and two variants with altered active sites were constructed based on homology models. All new enzyme variants showed significantly increased thermostability compared with the only experimentally confirmed benzaldehyde lyase from Pseudomonas fluorescens to date. The enzyme variants showed different substrate specificities and different activities in the presence of a range of co&#8208;solvents. The most stable variant was then immobilized and used for continuous production of enantiopure benzoin. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K.&#8197;S. Rabe et&#8197;al.

         <title>The Catalytic Mechanism of Pdx2 Glutaminase Driven by a Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Glu Triad: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 was studied with atomic detail employing the computational ONIOM hybrid QM/MM methodology. The results show that the catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 occurs in six steps that can be divided into four stages. These results can be used for the synthesis of new transition state analogue inhibitors capable of inhibiting Pdx2 and impair diseases like Malaria and Tuberculosis.







Abstract
The catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 was studied with atomic detail employing the computational ONIOM hybrid QM/MM methodology. Pdx2 employs a Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Glu catalytic triad to deaminate glutamine to glutamate and ammonia &#8211; the source of the nitrogen of pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP). This enzyme is, therefore, a rate&#8208;limiting step in the PLP biosynthetic pathway of Malaria and Tuberculosis pathogens that rely on this mechanism to obtain PLP. For this reason, Pdx2 is considered a novel and promising drug target to treat these diseases. The results obtained show that the catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 occurs in six steps that can be divided into four stages: (i)&#8197;activation of Cys87, (ii)&#8197;deamination of glutamine with the formation of the glutamyl&#8208;thioester intermediate, (iii)&#8197;hydrolysis of the formed intermediate, and (iv)&#8197;enzymatic turnover. The kinetic data available in the literature (19.1&#8211;19.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) agree very well with the calculated free energy barrier of the hydrolytic step (18.2&#8197;kcal.mol&#8722;11), which is the rate&#8208;limiting step of the catalytic process when substrate is readily available in the active site. This catalytic mechanism differs from other known amidases in three main points: i)&#8197;it requires the activation of the nucleophile Cys87 to a thiolate; ii)&#8197;the hydrolysis occurs in a single step and therefore does not require the formation of a second tetrahedral reaction intermediate, as it is proposed, and iii) Glu198 does not have a direct role in the catalytic process. Together, these results can be used for the synthesis of new transition state analogue inhibitors capable of inhibiting Pdx2 and impair diseases like Malaria and Tuberculosis.

         <title>A Specialized Dehydrogenase Provides l&#8208;Phenyllactate for FR900359 Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dehydrogenase FrsC is involved in biosynthesis of the Gq protein inhibiting natural product FR900359. Here, we biochemically characterized FrsC, catalyzing the formation of l&#8208;phenyllactate, and its subsequent incorporation into the FR assembly line followed by epimerization. A detailed bioinformatic analysis revealed that FrsC has evolved from primary metabolic enzymes to a specialized reductase accepting only aromatic substrates.







Abstract
d&#8208;Phenyllactate (PLA) is a component of the selective Gq protein inhibitor and nonribosomal cyclic depsipeptide FR900359 (FR). Here we report a detailed biochemical investigation of PLA biosynthesis and its incorporation into the natural product FR. The enzyme FrsC, member of the lactate/malate dehydrogenase superfamily, was shown to catalyze the formation of l&#8208;PLA from phenylpyruvate. FrsC was kinetically characterized and its substrate specificity determined. Incorporation of l&#8208;PLA was probed by assaying the adenylation domain FrsE&#8208;A3 and feeding studies with a Chromobacterium vaccinii &#916;frsC mutant, confirming preferred activation of l&#8208;PLA followed by on&#8208;line epimerization to d&#8208;PLA. Finally, detailed bioinformatic analyses of FrsC revealed its close relation to malate dehydrogenases from primary metabolism and suggest extensions in the substrate binding loop to be responsible for its adaptation to accepting larger aromatic substrates with high specificity.

         <title>The Small Open Reading Frame&#8208;Encoded Peptides: Advances in Methodologies and Functional Studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small open reading frames (sORFs) were historically annotated as noncoding or even junk sequences. Accumulating evidence suggests the existence of sORFs&#8208;encoded peptides (SEPs). Here we discuss the latest advances in methodologies for identifying SEPs with mass spectrometry, as well as the progress on functional studies of SEPs.







Abstract
Small open reading frames (sORFs) are an important class of genes with less than 100 codons. They were historically annotated as noncoding or even junk sequences. In recent years, accumulating evidence suggests that sORFs could encode a considerable number of polypeptides, many of which play important roles in both physiology and disease pathology. However, it has been technically challenging to directly detect sORF&#8208;encoded peptides (SEPs). Here, we discuss the latest advances in methodologies for identifying SEPs with mass spectrometry, as well as the progress on functional studies of SEPs.

Accumulating evidence suggests the existence of sORFs-encoded peptides (SEPs). Here we discuss the latest advances in methodologies for identifying SEPs with mass spectrometry, as well as the progress on functional studies of SEPs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small open reading frames (sORFs) are an important class of genes with less than 100 codons. They were historically annotated as noncoding or even junk sequences. In recent years, accumulating evidence suggests that sORFs could encode a considerable number of polypeptides, many of which play important roles in both physiology and disease pathology. However, it has been technically challenging to directly detect sORF-encoded peptides (SEPs). Here, we discuss the latest advances in methodologies for identifying SEPs with mass spectrometry, as well as the progress on functional studies of SEPs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oligo Pools as an Affordable Source of Synthetic DNA for Cost&#8208;Effective Library Construction in Protein&#8208; and Metabolic Pathway Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of large variant libraries is critical for rational protein engineering, directed evolution, and protein de novo design, but is constrained by the relatively high cost of DNA synthesis. Here, we consolidate methods that allow using array&#8208;synthesized oligo pools as DNA input &#8211; a cheap but error&#8208;prone source of DNA.







Abstract
The construction of custom libraries is critical for rational protein engineering and directed evolution. Array&#8208;synthesized oligo pools of thousands of user&#8208;defined sequences (up to &#8764;350&#8197;bases in length) have emerged as a low&#8208;cost commercially available source of DNA. These pools cost &#8804;10&#8201;% (depending on error rate and length) of other commercial sources of custom DNA, and this significant cost difference can determine whether an enzyme engineering project can be realized on a given research budget. However, while being cheap, oligo pools do suffer from a low concentration of individual oligos and relatively high error rates. Several powerful techniques that specifically make use of oligo pools have been developed and proven valuable or even essential for next&#8208;generation protein and pathway engineering strategies, such as sequence&#8208;function mapping, enzyme minimization, or de&#8208;novo design. Here we consolidate the knowledge on these techniques and their applications to facilitate the use of oligo pools within the protein engineering community.

         <title>Mammalian Chemical Genomics towards Identifying Targets and Elucidating Modes&#8208;of&#8208;Action of Bioactive Compounds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical genomic screens using shRNA or CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA libraries in mammalian cultured cells play central roles in identifying modes of action of bioactive compounds. In this review, recent advances of chemical genomic approaches in mammalian cultured cells to identify the molecular target, modes of action, and synthetic lethal pathways of compounds of interest, with a focus on recent examples including our results are discussed.







Abstract
The step of identifying target molecules and elucidating the mode of action of bioactive compounds is a major bottleneck for drug discovery from phenotypic screening. Genetic screening for genes that affect drug sensitivity or phenotypes of mammalian cultured cells is a powerful tool to obtain clues to their modes of action. Chemical genomic screening systems for comprehensively identifying such genes or genetic pathways have been established using shRNA libraries for RNA interference&#8208;mediated mRNA knockdown or sgRNA libraries for CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;mediated gene knockout. The combination of chemical genomic screening in mammalian cells with other approaches such as biochemical searches for target molecules, phenotypic profiling, and yeast genetics provides a systematic way to elucidate the mode of action by converging various pieces of information regarding target molecules, target pathways, and synthetic lethal pathways.
