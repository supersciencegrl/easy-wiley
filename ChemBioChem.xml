         <title>Construction of a CRISPR&#8208;Biolayer Interferometry Platform for Real&#8208;Time, Sensitive, and Specific DNA Detection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Threefold detection: A CRISPR biosensor is immobilized on a biolayer to construct a CRISPR&#8208;BLI platform for DNA detection. The CRISPR&#8208;BLI chip is rapid, label&#8208;free, and real&#8208;time, and has high sequence affinity and specificity due to the properties of BLI and the CRISPR probe. Coupling with PCR improves the sensitivity to 1.34&#8197;pg, revealing promising applications in dsDNA detection.







Abstract
The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology has been widely applied for nucleic acid detection because of its high specificity. By using the highly specific and irreversible bond between HaloTag and its alkane chlorine ligand, we modified dCas9 (deactivated CRISPR/Cas9) with biotin as a biosensor to detect nucleic acids. The CRISPR biosensor was facilely prepared to adequately maintain its DNA&#8208;recognition capability. Furthermore, by coupling biolayer interferometry (BLI) with the CRISPR biosensor, a real&#8208;time, sensitive, and rapid digital system called CRISPR&#8208;BLI was established for the detection of double&#8208;stranded DNA. The CRISPR biosensor immobilised on the biolayer could recruit the target DNA onto the biosensor surface and change its optical thickness, resulting in a shift in the interference pattern and responding signal of the BLI. The CRISPR&#8208;BLI system was further applied to detect the ALP gene of Escherichia coli DH5&#945; combined with a polymerase chain reaction, which demonstrated a linear range from 20 to 20&#8201;000&#8197;pg and a low detection limit (1.34&#8197;pg). The CRISPR&#8208;BLI system is a promising approach for rapid and sensitive detection of target DNA analytes.

         <title>Polypyridyl Ruthenium(II) Complexes with Red&#8208;Shifted Absorption: New Promises in Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing metal&#8208;based drugs that can be activated by red light is the &#8220;holy grail&#8220; of photodynamic therapy (PDT) research. This highlight summarizes current research on RuII&#8208;polypyridyl complexes with red&#8208;shifted absorption to achieve in&#8208;vitro and in&#8208;vivo photo&#8208;cytotoxicity with 540&#8211;600&#8197;nm light. The huge potential of judicial ligand modification and in&#8208;silico optimization to achieve red&#8208;light, metal&#8208;based PDT drugs are indicated.







Abstract
In the field of cancer photodynamic therapy (PDT) research, development of metal&#8208;based PDT drugs that can be used under red light exposure is the &#8220;holy grail&#8221; to achieve. This highlight highlighted few current literatures on polypyridyl&#8208;based Ru(II) complexes with significantly red&#8208;shifted absorption to achieve in&#8208;vitro and in&#8208;vivo PDT effect in 540&#8211;600 nm light. The enormous potential of judicial ligand choice and in&#8208;silico optimization to achieve the red light, metal&#8208;based PDT drugs are discussed.

         <title>Expanding the substrate scope of nitrating cytochrome P450 TxtE by active site engineering of a reductase fusion</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic nitration reactions are a cornerstone of organic chemistry, but are challenging to scale due to corrosive reagents and elevated temperatures. The cytochrome P450 TxtE nitrates the indole 4&#8208;position of L&#8208;tryptophan at room temperature using NO, O  2  and NADPH, and has potential to be developed into a useful aromatic nitration biocatalyst. However, its narrow substrate scope (requiring both the alpha&#8208;amino acid and indole functionalities) have hindered this. Screening of an R59 mutant library of a TxtE&#8208;reductase fusion protein identified a variant (R59C) that nitrates tryptamine, which is not accepted by native TxtE. This variant exhibits a broader substrate scope than the wild type enzyme and is able to nitrate a range of tryptamine analogues, with significantly alterations to the aromatic and aminoethyl moieties.</dc:description>

         <title>Asparaginyl Ligases: New Enzymes for the Protein Engineer's Toolbox</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intents and (re)purposes: Asparaginyl ligases are highly efficient transpeptidases. These enzymes naturally catalyse the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclisation of small plant peptides, but recently have been repurposed for the modification of diverse proteins. This minireview describes the current state of protein engineering with asparaginyl ligases.







Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;catalysed site&#8208;specific protein modifications enable the precision manufacture of conjugates for the study of protein function and/or for therapeutic or diagnostic applications. Asparaginyl ligases are a class of highly efficient transpeptidases with the capacity to modify proteins bearing only a tripeptide recognition motif. Herein, we review the types of protein modification that are accessible using these enzymes, including N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal protein labelling, head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclisation, and protein&#8208;protein conjugation. We describe the progress that has been made to engineer highly efficient ligases as well as efforts to chemically manipulate the enzyme reaction to favour product formation. These enzymes are powerful additions to the protein engineer&#8216;s toolbox.

         <title>Thermodynamic Stability of G&#8208;Quadruplexes: Impact of Sequence and Environment</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract.  G&#8208;quadruplexes have attracted growing interest in recent years due to their occurrence  in vivo  and their possible biological functions. In addition to being promising targets for drug design, these four&#8208;stranded nucleic acid structures have also been recognized as versatile tools for various technological applications. Whereas a large number of studies have yielded insight into their remarkable structural diversity, our current knowledge on G&#8208;quadruplex stabilities as a function of sequence and environmental factors only gradually emerges with an expanding collection of thermodynamic data. This minireview provides an overview of general rules that may be used to better evaluate quadruplex thermodynamic stabilities but also discusses present challenges in predicting most stable folds for a given sequence and environment.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>PARP14 is an interferon&#8208;stimulated gene that is overexpressed in multiple tumor types, influencing pro&#8208;tumor macrophage polarization as well as suppressing the antitumor inflammation response by modulating IFN&#8208;&#947; and IL&#8208;4 signaling.&#160; PARP14 is a 203 kDa protein that possesses a catalytic domain responsible for the transfer of mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribose to its substrates.&#160; PARP14 also contains three macrodomains and a WWE domain which are binding modules for mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribose and poly&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribose, respectively, in addition to two&#160;RNA recognition motifs.&#160; Catalytic inhibitors of PARP14 have been shown to reverse IL&#8208;4 driven pro&#8208;tumor gene expression in macrophages, however it is not clear what roles the non&#8208;enzymatic biomolecular recognition motifs play in PARP14&#8208;driven immunology and inflammation.&#160;  To further understand this, we have discovered a heterobifunctional small molecule designed based on a catalytic inhibitor of PARP14 that binds in the enzyme&#8217;s NAD  +  &#8208;binding site and recruits the E3 ligase cereblon to ubiquitinate it and selectively target it for degradation.</dc:description>

         <title>Sirtuin 2 Regulates Protein LactoylLys Modifications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) alter the structure and function of enzymes and are often regulated by enzymatic removal by &#8220;erasers&#8221;. The nonenzymatically derived PTM lactoylLys was recently identified in states of elevated glycolytic flux. Herein, we report the deacylase sirtuin 2 as the first known &#8220;eraser&#8221; for lactoylLys, expanding the knowledge of enzymatic regulation of nonenzymatically derived protein PTMs.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) play roles in both physiological and pathophysiological processes through the regulation of enzyme structure and function. We recently identified a novel PTM, lactoylLys, derived through a nonenzymatic mechanism from the glycolytic by&#8208;product, lactoylglutathione. Under physiologic scenarios, glyoxalase 2 prevents the accumulation of lactoylglutathione and thus lactoylLys modifications. What dictates the site&#8208;specificity and abundance of lactoylLys PTMs, however, remains unknown. Here, we report sirtuin 2 as a lactoylLys eraser. Using chemical biology and CRISPR&#8208;Cas9, we show that SIRT2 controls the abundance of this PTM both globally and on chromatin. These results address a major gap in our understanding of how nonenzymatic PTMs are regulated and controlled.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Targeted Metallodrugs: An Untapped Source of Artificial Gene Editing Technology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinking the duplex and other alterations: This review describes the rational design of metal complexes with nucleic acid recognition properties and how the sequence&#8208;specific targeting of these interactions is opening up new avenues in the fields of gene engineering and targeted therapies.







Abstract
DNA binding metal complexes are synonymous with anticancer drug discovery. Given the array of structural and chemical reactivity properties available through careful design, metal complexes have been directed to bind nucleic acid structures through covalent or noncovalent binding modes. Several recognition modes &#8211; including crosslinking, intercalation, and oxidation &#8211; are central to the clinical success of broad&#8208;spectrum anticancer metallodrugs. However, recent progress in nucleic acid click chemistry coupled with advancement in our understanding of metal complex&#8211;nucleic acid interactions has opened up new avenues in genetic engineering and targeted therapies. Several of these applications are enabled by the hybridisation of oligonucleotide or polyamine probes to discrete metal complexes, which facilitate site&#8208;specific reactivity at the nucleic acid interface under the guidance of the probe. This Review focuses on recent advancements in hybrid design and, by way of an introduction to this topic, we provide a detailed overview of nucleic acid structures and metal complex&#8211;nucleic acid interactions. Our aim is to provide readers with an insight on the rational design of metal complexes with DNA recognition properties and an understanding of how the sequence&#8208;specific targeting of these interactions can be achieved for gene engineering applications.

         <title>Secondary Alcohol Dehydrogenases from Thermoanaerobacter pseudoethanolicus and Thermoanaerobacter brockii as Robust Catalysts</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scope and selectivity: Recent efforts to expand the substrate scope and tune the enantioselectivity of secondary ADHs from T. pseudoethanolicus and T. brockii by using site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and directed evolution are reviewed. Moreover, the thermal stability and organic solvent tolerance of these enzymes is illustrated by their concurrent inclusion in other interesting reactions to produce optically active alcohols and amines.







Abstract
Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) are an important type of enzyme that have significant applications as biocatalysts. Secondary ADHs from Thermoanaerobacter pseudoethanolicus (TeSADH) and Thermoanaerobacter brockii (TbSADH) are well&#8208;known as robust catalysts. However, like most other ADHs, these enzymes suffer from their high substrate specificities (i.&#8201;e., limited substrate scope), which to some extent restricts their use as biocatalysts. This minireview discusses recent efforts to expand the substrate scope and tune the enantioselectivity of TeSADH and TbSADH by using site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and directed evolution. Various examples of asymmetric synthesis of optically active alcohols using both enzymes are highlighted. Moreover, the unique thermal stability and organic solvent tolerance of these enzymes is illustrated by their concurrent inclusion with other interesting reactions to synthesize optically active alcohols and amines. For instance, TeSADH has been used in quantitative non&#8208;stereoselective oxidation of alcohols to deracemize alcohols via cyclic deracemization and in the racemization of enantiopure alcohols to accomplish a bienzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution.

         <title>Harnessing Multiple, Nonproteogenic Substitutions to Optimize CSP:ComD Hydrophobic Interactions in Group&#8197;1 Streptococcus pneumoniae</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unnaturally optimized: The use of unnatural amino acids allowed the optimization of hydrophobic interactions between CSP1 and the cognate ComD1 receptor by assessing how multiple, coordinated substitutions in the CSP1 amino acid sequence can affect CSP1 binding.







Abstract
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a human pathobiont that causes drastic antibiotic&#8208;resistant infections and is responsible for millions of deaths universally. Pneumococcus pathogenicity relies on the competence&#8208;stimulating peptide (CSP)&#8208;mediated quorum&#8208;sensing (QS) pathway that controls competence development for genetic transformation and, consequently, the spread of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. Modulation of QS in S. pneumoniae can therefore be used to enervate pneumococcal infectivity as well as minimize the susceptibility to resistance development. In this work, we sought to optimize the interaction of CSP1 with its cognate transmembrane histidine kinase receptor (ComD1) through substitution of proteogenic and nonproteogenic amino acids on the hydrophobic binding face of CSP1. The findings from this study not only provided additional structure&#8211;activity data that are significant in optimizing CSP1 potency, but also led to the development of potent QS modulators. These CSP&#8208;based QS modulators could be used as privileged scaffolds for the development of antimicrobial agents against pneumococcal infections.

         <title>Can Precision Electrophile Signaling Make a Meaningful and Lasting Impression in Drug Design?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Medicinal chemists have uncovered that the incorporation of an electrophilic appendage into a non&#8208; covalent pharmacophore can confer important benefits, such as improved selectivity. Studies on electrophile signaling have shown that when a matched electrophile engages with its protein target, unexpected phenotypic responses can ensue. Such responses are above and beyond what has been typically reported for covalent pharmacophore&#8208;protein target interactions. So, can we blend these concepts together to make better drugs?







Abstract
For several years, drugs with reactive electrophilic appendages have been developed. These units typically confer prolonged residence time of the drugs on their protein targets, and may assist targeting shallow binding sites and/or improving the drug&#8211;protein target spectrum. Studies on natural electrophilic molecules have indicated that, in many instances, natural electrophiles use similar mechanisms to alter signaling pathways. However, natural reactive species are also endowed with other important mechanisms to hone signaling properties that are uncommon in drug design. These include ability to be active at low occupancy and elevated inhibitor kinetics. Herein, we discuss how we have begun to harness these properties in inhibitor design.

     alt="Can Precision Electrophile Signaling Make a Meaningful and Lasting Impression in Drug Design?"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Medicinal chemists have uncovered&lt;/b&gt; that the incorporation of an electrophilic appendage into a non&#8208; covalent pharmacophore can confer important benefits, such as improved selectivity. Studies on electrophile signaling have shown that when a matched electrophile engages with its protein target, unexpected phenotypic responses can ensue. Such responses are above and beyond what has been typically reported for covalent pharmacophore&#8208;protein target interactions. So, can we blend these concepts together to make better drugs?

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several years, drugs with reactive electrophilic appendages have been developed. These units typically confer prolonged residence time of the drugs on their protein targets, and may assist targeting shallow binding sites and/or improving the drug&#8211;protein target spectrum. Studies on natural electrophilic molecules have indicated that, in many instances, natural electrophiles use similar mechanisms to alter signaling pathways. However, natural reactive species are also endowed with other important mechanisms to hone signaling properties that are uncommon in drug design. These include ability to be active at low occupancy and elevated inhibitor kinetics. Herein, we discuss how we have begun to harness these properties in inhibitor design.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Two Triterpene Synthases from Imperata cylindrica Catalyzing the Formation of a Pair of Diastereoisomers through Boat or Chair Cyclization</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling conformation during cyclization: I. cylindrica produces the diastereomeric triterpenes isoarborinol and fernenol depending on whether the B&#8208;ring of oxidosqualene was in a boat or chair conformation during cyclization. Mutational studies on the two enzymes resulted in partial conversion of the products. Placing a histidine residue at a critical site resulted in the production of a rare triterpene.







Abstract
Imperata cylindrica is known to produce a pair of triterpenes, isoarborinol and fernenol, that exhibit identical planar structures but possess opposite stereochemistry at six of the nine chiral centers. These differences arise from a boat or a chair cyclization of the B&#8208;ring of the substrate. Herein, we report the characterization of three OSC genes from I. cylindrica. IcOSC1 and IcOSC5 were identified as isoarborinol and fernenol synthases, respectively, while IcOSC3 was characterized as a multifunctional enzyme that produces glutinol and friedelin as its major products. Mutational studies of isoarborinol and fernenol synthases revealed that the residues surrounding the DCTAE motif partially affected the conformation of the B&#8208;ring during cyclization. Additionally, the IcOSC1&#8208;W255H mutant produced the rare triterpene boehmerol. The introduced histidine residue presumably abstracted a proton from the intermediary carbocation at C18 during the 1,2&#8208;rearrangement. Expression analysis indicated that all OSC genes were highly expressed in stems.

         <title>Probing the Interaction of Huntingtin Exon&#8208;1 Polypeptides with the Chaperonin Nanomachine GroEL</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyglutamine expansion within the region of huntingtin encoded by exon&#8208;1 of the htt gene results in an aggregation&#8208;prone protein that accumulates in neuronal inclusion bodies. We show that the chaperonin GroEL, the bacterial homolog of human mitochondrial Hsp60, inhibits fibril formation of huntingtin exon&#8208;1 peptides and probe the interaction using NMR relaxation&#8208;based experiments designed to explore short&#8208;lived sparsely populated states.







Abstract
Huntington's disease arises from polyQ expansion within the exon&#8208;1 region of huntingtin (httex1), resulting in an aggregation&#8208;prone protein that accumulates in neuronal inclusion bodies. We investigate the interaction of various httex1 constructs with the bacterial analog (GroEL) of the human chaperonin Hsp60. Using fluorescence spectroscopy and electron and atomic force microscopy, we show that GroEL inhibits fibril formation. The binding kinetics of httex1 constructs with intact GroEL and a mini&#8208;chaperone comprising the apical domain is characterized by relaxation&#8208;based NMR measurements. The lifetimes of the complexes range from 100 to 400&#8197;&#956;s with equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) of &#8764;1&#8211;2&#8197;mM. The binding interface is formed by the N&#8208;terminal amphiphilic region of httex1 (which adopts a partially helical conformation) and the H and I helices of the GroEL apical domain. Sequestration of monomeric httex1 by GroEL likely increases the critical concentration required for fibrillization.

         <title>G&#8208;Quadruplex Formation in a Putative Coding Region of White Spot Syndrome Virus: Structural and Thermodynamic Aspects</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The right spot for white spot: A G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming sequence identified within the DNA genome of white spot syndrome virus folds into a major and a thermodynamically less stable minor loop isomer. The parallel quadruplex scaffold might constitute a potential target for viral drug development against white spot disease.







Abstract
White spot disease (WSD) is one of the most devastating viral infections of crustaceans caused by the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). A conserved sequence WSSV131 in the DNA genome of WSSV was found to fold into a polymorphic G&#8208;quadruplex structure. Supported by two mutant sequences with single G&#8594;T substitutions in the third G4 tract of WSSV131, circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopic analyses demonstrate folding of the wild&#8208;type sequence into a three&#8208;tetrad parallel topology comprising three propeller loops with a major 1&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8201;:&#8201;1 and a minor 1&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2 loop length arrangement. A thermodynamic analysis of quadruplex formation by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicates a thermodynamically more stable 1&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8201;:&#8201;1 loop isomer. DSC also revealed the formation of additional highly stable multimeric species with populations depending on potassium ion concentration.

         <title>Variety of nucleotide polymerase mutants aiming to synthesize modified RNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Significant efforts have been made to develop therapeutic RNA aptamers that exploit synthetic RNA to capture target molecules. However, ensuring RNA aptamers are resistant against intrinsic nucleases remains an issue and restricts their use as therapeutics. Introduction of chemical modifications to the 2' sugar moiety of RNA improves their stability effectively and can be achieved by chemical synthesis using modified phosphoramidites; however, this approach is not suitable for preparing long RNA molecules. Although recombinant nucleotide polymerases can transcribe RNA, these polymerases cannot synthesize modified RNA because they do not recognize 2' modified nucleoside triphosphates. In this review, we focused on several polymerase mutants that tolerate substrates containing modifications of the 2' sugar moiety to synthesize RNA, and the problems that must be overcome to prepare chemically modified RNA with high efficacy by in vitro transcription.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cyanine&#8208;Bridged Somatostatin Hybrid Probe for Multimodal SSTR2 Imaging in Vitro and in Vivo: Synthesis and Evaluation</title>

Multifunctional cyanine dyes: Multimodal imaging agents can be built up based on an asymmetric cyanine dye connecting the radionuclide and targeting unit. Insertion of a cyanine dye into the clinically approved radiopharmaceutical 68Ga&#8208;DOTATATE allowed the identification of cancer tissue in&#8197;vivo and ex vivo by using radionuclear and fluorescence imaging.







Abstract
Multimodal imaging probes have attracted the interest of ongoing research, for example, for the surgical removal of tumors. Modular synthesis approaches allow the construction of hybrid probes consisting of a radiotracer, a fluorophore and a targeting unit. We present the synthesis of a new asymmetric bifunctional cyanine dye that can be used as a structural and functional linker for the construction of such hybrid probes. 68Ga&#8208;DOTATATE, a well&#8208;characterized radiopeptide targeting the overexpressed somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2) in neuroendocrine tumors, was labeled with our cyanine dye, thus providing additional information along with the data obtained from the radiotracer. We tested the SSTR2&#8208;targeting and imaging properties of the resulting probe 68Ga&#8208;DOTA&#8208;ICC&#8208;TATE in&#8197;vitro and in a tumor xenograft mouse model. Despite the close proximity between dye and pharmacophore, we observed a high binding affinity towards SSTR2 as well as elevated uptake in SSTR2&#8208;overexpressing tumors in the positron emission tomography (PET) scan and histological examination.

         <title>Expanding the Toolbox of R&#8208;Selective Amine Transaminases by Identification and Characterization of New Members</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 7, Page 1232-1242, April 6, 2021. </description>

Diversifying: The toolbox of R&#8208;selective amine transaminases (ATAs) has been expanded by an ATA containing a motif characteristic for d&#8208;ATAs, two ATAs with a shortened/missing N&#8208;terminal helix and the first ATA with known structure from a Gram&#8208;negative bacterium. Their active site charges vary significantly compared to known ATAs correlating with their diverging substrate scope.







Abstract
Amine transaminases (ATAs) are used to synthesize enantiomerically pure amines, which are building blocks for pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. R&#8208;selective ATAs belong to the fold type IV PLP&#8208;dependent enzymes, and different sequence&#8208;, structure&#8208; and substrate scope&#8208;based features have been identified in the past decade. However, our knowledge is still restricted due to the limited number of characterized (R)&#8208;ATAs, with additional bias towards fungal origin. We aimed to expand the toolbox of (R)&#8208;ATAs and contribute to the understanding of this enzyme subfamily. We identified and characterized four new (R)&#8208;ATAs. The ATA from Exophiala sideris contains a motif characteristic for d&#8208;ATAs, which was previously believed to be a disqualifying factor for (R)&#8208;ATA activity. The crystal structure of the ATA from Shinella is the first from a Gram&#8208;negative bacterium. The ATAs from Pseudonocardia acaciae and Tetrasphaera japonica are the first characterized (R)&#8208;ATAs with a shortened/missing N&#8208;terminal helix. The active&#8208;site charges vary significantly between the new and known ATAs, correlating with their diverging substrate scope.

         <title>Efficient Editing of Silver Nanoclusters by Changing Simply One Cytosine in a DNA Template</title>

Let me introduce you: By introducing and moving one cytosine in spacer of emitter domain, a simple strategy was constructed to regulate the emissive colors of AgNCs, thereby extending the library of DNA templatse for synthesizing diverse DNA/AgNCs.







Abstract
DNA with genetic information was edited to regulate and repair the structure and function of a protein. In DNA nanotechnology, DNA with programmable information can be designed to edit the fluorescence intensity and emissive colors of DNA&#8208;stabilized silver nanoclusters (DNA/AgNCs). By introducing and moving one cytosine in the spacer of the emitter domain, we have built up a simple strategy to regulate the excitation and emission wavelengths of AgNCs. When replacing thymine in the spacer of the emitter with one cytosine, the expected excitation and emission change do not occur. However, after moving the introduced cytosine, DNA templates produce AgNCs with extremely different excitation and emission wavelengths from those of the initial template, leading to a template for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissive species with the highest fluorescence intensity. The formation of AgNCs induces the DNA template into condensed secondary structure based on an altered migration rate in PAGE. The simple strategy of moving one cytosine in a spacer in the emitter domain can enrich the library of templates for synthesizing diverse DNA/AgNCs and has great potential in bioimaging and probe design.

Strain&#8208;specific features: Characterization of the lipopolysaccharide from F. nucleatum ssp. animalis ATCC 51191 revealed a novel O&#8208;antigen structure for bacterial LPS [&#8594;4)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;GlcpNAcA&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;GlcpNAc3NAlaA&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;FucpNAc4NR&#8208;(1&#8594;], and a bis&#8208;phosphorylated hexa&#8208;acylated lipid&#8197;A moiety. These data showed that F. nucleatum ATCC 51191 has a novel O&#8208;antigen, and pave the way towards understanding the immunological perception of this macromolecule.







Abstract
Fusobacterium nucleatum is a common member of the oral microbiota. However, this symbiont has been found to play an active role in disease development. As a Gram&#8208;negative bacterium, F. nucleatum has a protective outer membrane layer whose external leaflet is mainly composed of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs). LPSs play a crucial role in the interaction between bacteria and the host immune system. Here, we characterised the structure of the O&#8208;antigen and lipid&#8197;A from F. nucleatum ssp. animalis ATCC 51191 by using a combination of GC&#8208;MS, MALDI and NMR techniques. The results revealed a novel repeat of the O&#8208;antigen structure of the LPS, [&#8594;4)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;GlcpNAcA&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;GlcpNAc3NAlaA&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;FucpNAc4NR&#8208;(1&#8594;], (R=acetylated 60&#8201;%), and a bis&#8208;phosphorylated hexa&#8208;acylated lipid&#8197;A moiety. Taken together these data showed that F. nucleatum ATCC 51191 has a distinct LPS which might differentially influence recognition by immune cells.

As a Gram&#8208;negative bacterium, &lt;i&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; has a protective outer membrane layer whose external leaflet is mainly composed of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs). LPSs play a crucial role in the interaction between bacteria and the host immune system. Here, we characterised the structure of the O&#8208;antigen and lipid&#8197;A from &lt;i&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; ssp. &lt;i&gt;animalis&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 51191 by using a combination of GC&#8208;MS, MALDI and NMR techniques. The results revealed a novel repeat of the O&#8208;antigen structure of the LPS, [&#8594;4)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;Glc&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;NAcA&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;Glc&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;NAc3NAlaA&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;Fuc&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;NAc4NR&#8208;(1&#8594;], (R=acetylated 60&#8201;%), and a bis&#8208;phosphorylated hexa&#8208;acylated lipid&#8197;A moiety. Taken together these data showed that &lt;i&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 51191 has a distinct LPS which might differentially influence recognition by immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;

Seeing dots and AuNPs: Tetrahedral DNA nanoconjugates have been constructed from DNA, peptides, gold nanoparticles and carbon nanodots. Target telomerase and miRNA can achieve strand displacement of corresponding DNA strands with quenched fluorescence reporters. The as&#8208;prepared biosystem is suitable for the simultaneous sensing and imaging of the dual biomarkers for diagnostics purposes.







Abstract
In this study, a tetrahedral DNA nanostructure was first self&#8208;assembled; this was then conjugated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and carbon nanodots (CDs). The fabricated nanocomposites allow simultaneous analysis of telomerase activity and miRNA with dual fluorescence channels. By further introducing an iRGD peptide sequence, the nanoconjuates can be conveniently transferred inside living cells for in&#8197;situ imaging. The analytical performances and anti&#8208;jamming capabilities are excellent. Meanwhile, the materials are highly biocompatible for intracellular applications. Therefore, the proposed biosystem shows great promise as a powerful tool for quantitative analysis of the dual biomarkers. The strategy can also be further exploited as a versatile platform for in&#8197;situ detection of many other targets for early disease diagnosis.

Abstract
Many bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, regulate phenotypic switching in a population density&#8208;dependent manner through a phenomenon known as quorum sensing (QS). For Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, QS relies on the synthesis, transmission, and perception of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight signal molecules that are predominantly N&#8208;acyl&#8208;l&#8208;homoserine lactones (AHLs). Efforts to disrupt AHL&#8208;mediated QS have largely focused on the development of synthetic AHL analogues (SAHLAs) that are structurally similar to native AHLs. However, like AHLs, these molecules tend to be hydrophobic and are poorly soluble under aqueous conditions. Water&#8208;soluble macrocycles, such as cyclodextrins (CDs), that encapsulate hydrophobic guests have long been used by both the agricultural and pharmaceutical industries to overcome the solubility issues associated with hydrophobic compounds of interest. Conveniently, CDs have also demonstrated anti&#8208;AHL&#8208;mediated QS effects. Here, using fluorescence spectroscopy, NMR spectrometry, and mass spectrometry, we evaluate the affinity of SAHLAs, as well as their hydrolysis products, for &#946;&#8208;CD inclusion. We also evaluated the ability of these complexes to inhibit wild&#8208;type P. aeruginosa virulence in a Caenorhabditis elegans host infection study, for the first time. Our efforts confirm the potential of &#946;&#8208;CDs for the improved delivery of SAHLAs at the host/microbial interface, expanding the utility of this approach as a strategy for probing and controlling QS.

Less lipophilic ligands: A novel TLR2 ligand has been designed and synthesized to be subsequently conjugated with synthetic peptides containing clinically relevant neoepitopes. By treating HEK&#8208;TLR2 cells, human moDCs and antigen specific human T&#8208;cells with these new constructs, the immunogenic potential of the new TLR2 ligand and the conjugation of TLR ligands with neoepitopes was assessed.







Abstract
Synthetic vaccines, based on antigenic peptides that comprise MHC&#8722;I and MHC&#8208;II T&#8208;cell epitopes expressed by tumors, show great promise for the immunotherapy of cancer. For optimal immunogenicity, the synthetic peptides (SPs) should be adjuvanted with suitable immunostimulatory additives. Previously, we have shown that improved immunogenicity in&#8197;vivo is obtained with vaccine modalities in which an SP is covalently connected to an adjuvanting moiety, typically a ligand to Toll&#8208;like receptor 2 (TLR2). SPs were covalently attached to UPam, which is a derivative of the classic TLR2 ligand Pam3CysSK4. A disadvantage of the triply palmitoylated UPam is its high lipophilicity, which precludes universal adoption of this adjuvant for covalent modification of various antigenic peptides as it renders the synthetic vaccine insoluble in several cases. Here, we report a novel conjugatable TLR2 ligand, mini&#8208;UPam, which contains only one palmitoyl chain, rather than three, and therefore has less impact on the solubility and other physicochemical properties of a synthetic peptide. In this study, we used SPs that contain the clinically relevant neoepitopes identified in a melanoma patient who completely recovered after T&#8208;cell therapy. Homogeneous mini&#8208;UPam&#8208;SP conjugates have been prepared in good yields by stepwise solid&#8208;phase synthesis that employed a mini&#8208;UPam building block pre&#8208;prepared in solution and the standard set of Fmoc&#8208;amino acids. The immunogenicity of the novel mini&#8208;UPam&#8208;SP conjugates was demonstrated by using the cancer patient's T&#8208;cells.

         <title>Quadruplex&#8208;Templated and Catalyzed Ligation of Nucleic Acids</title>

DNA catalytic system templated and catalyzed by quadruplexes. This system can create new opportunities for chemical reactions requiring harsh experimental conditions unsuitable for DNA duplex&#8208;templated systems. The quadruplex&#8208;templated system might represent initial DNA catalytic reaction involved in primordial evolution.







Abstract
Template&#8208;guided chemical reactions between nucleic acid strands are an important process in biomedical research. However, almost all of these reactions employ an oligonucleotide&#8208;templated approach that is based on the double&#8208;helix alignment. The moderate stability of the double helix makes this approach unsuitable for many chemical reactions, so alternative nucleic acid alignment mechanisms, demonstrating higher thermal and chemical stability, are desirable. Earlier, we described a noncovalent coupling mechanism between DNA strands through a quadruplex&#8208;and&#8208;Mg2+ connection (QMC). QMC is based on G&#8208;quadruplexes and allows unusually stable and specific interactions. Herein, a novel catalytic nucleic acid reaction, based on QMC, is described. This approach uses G&#8208;tetrads as a structural and recognition element without employing Watson&#8208;Crick complementarity rules at any stage of substrate/catalyst formation or interaction between them. Quadruplex&#8208;templated ligation can be achieved through the self&#8208;ligation of two nucleic acid strands, or through a quadruplex catalyst, which forms a G&#8208;triplex and specifically connects the strands. The process is extraordinarily robust and efficient. For instance, the ligation of carbodiimide&#8208;activated substrates can proceed in boiling solutions, and complete ligation is demonstrated within a minute. The quadruplex&#8208;templated and catalyzed reactions will create new opportunities for chemical reactions requiring harsh experimental conditions.

However, almost all of these reactions employ an oligonucleotide&#8208;templated approach that is based on the double&#8208;helix alignment. The moderate stability of the double helix makes this approach unsuitable for many chemical reactions, so alternative nucleic acid alignment mechanisms, demonstrating higher thermal and chemical stability, are desirable. Earlier, we described a noncovalent coupling mechanism between DNA strands through a quadruplex&#8208;and&#8208;Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; connection (QMC). QMC is based on G&#8208;quadruplexes and allows unusually stable and specific interactions. Herein, a novel catalytic nucleic acid reaction, based on QMC, is described. This approach uses G&#8208;tetrads as a structural and recognition element without employing Watson&#8208;Crick complementarity rules at any stage of substrate/catalyst formation or interaction between them. Quadruplex&#8208;templated ligation can be achieved through the self&#8208;ligation of two nucleic acid strands, or through a quadruplex catalyst, which forms a G&#8208;triplex and specifically connects the strands. The process is extraordinarily robust and efficient. For instance, the ligation of carbodiimide&#8208;activated substrates can proceed in boiling solutions, and complete ligation is demonstrated within a minute. The quadruplex&#8208;templated and catalyzed reactions will create new opportunities for chemical reactions requiring harsh experimental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

Tough guy: Enzymatic characterisation showed that a &#946;&#8208;glycosidase from Alicyclobacillus herbarius was stable over a broad range of pH values and temperatures, also exhibiting excellent tolerance to sugars and organic solvents, specially to ethanol. The enzyme was applied in the hydrolysis of isoflavone glucosides in an ethanolic extract of soy flour with outstanding results.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Glucosidases are used in the food industry to hydrolyse glycosidic bonds in complex sugars, with enzymes sourced from extremophiles better able to tolerate the process conditions. In this work, a novel &#946;&#8208;glycosidase from the acidophilic organism Alicyclobacillus herbarius was cloned and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). AheGH1 was stable over a broad range of pH values (5&#8211;11) and temperatures (4&#8211;55&#8201;&#176;C). The enzyme exhibited excellent tolerance to fructose and good tolerance to glucose, retaining 65&#8201;% activity in the presence of 10&#8201;% (w/v) glucose. It also tolerated organic solvents, some of which appeared to have a stimulating effect, in particular ethanol with a 1.7&#8208;fold increase in activity at 10&#8201;% (v/v). The enzyme was then applied for the cleavage of isoflavone from isoflavone glucosides in an ethanolic extract of soy flour, to produce soy isoflavones, which constitute a valuable food supplement, full conversion was achieved within 15&#8197;min at 30&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Superior Proton&#8208;Transfer Catalytic Promiscuity of Cytochrome&#8197;c in Self&#8208;Organized Media</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 7, Page 1285-1291, April 6, 2021. </description>

Vintage and versatile: A catalytic property of cyt&#8197;c towards proton transfer reactions occurs only in membrane&#8208;mimetic media and mostly proceeds through the involvement of His18 in the case of ferricytochrome&#8197;c. This result strengthens the previous claim of promiscuous biocatalytic property of early developed protein/enzymes in evolutionary processes, and exemplifies emergent behavioural properties of biomolecules in response to their surroundings.







Abstract
Evolutionarily elderly proteins commonly feature greater catalytic promiscuity. Cytochrome&#8197;c is among the first set of proteins in evolution to have known prospects in electron transport and peroxidative properties. Here, we report that cyt&#8197;c is also a proficient proton&#8208;transfer catalyst and enhances the Kemp elimination (KE; model reaction to show proton transfer catalytic property) by &#8764;750&#8208;fold on self&#8208;organized systems like micelles and vesicles. The self&#8208;organized systems mimic the mitochondrial environment in&#8197;vitro for cyt&#8197;c. Using an array of biophysical and biochemical mutational assays, both acid&#8211;base and redox mechanistic pathways have been explored. The histidine moiety close to hemin group (His18) is mainly responsible for proton abstraction to promote the concerted E2 pathway for KE catalysis when cyt&#8197;c is in its oxidized form; this has also been confirmed by a H18A mutant of cyt&#8197;c. However, the redox pathway is predominant under reducing conditions in the presence of dithiothreitol over the pH range 6&#8211;7.4. Interestingly, we found almost 750&#8208;fold enhanced KE catalysis by cyt&#8197;c compared to aqueous buffer. Overall, in addition to providing mechanistic insights, the data reveal an unprecedented catalytic property of cyt&#8197;c that could be of high importance in an evolutionary perspective considering its role in delineating the phylogenic tree and also towards generating programmable designer biocatalysts.

         <title>How To Quantify a Genetic Firewall? A Polarity&#8208;Based Metric for Genetic Code Engineering</title>

Quantifying the distance: If two organisms operate under different genetic codes, how likely is that they could still properly interpret each other's genes? We introduce a versatile metric to quantify the distance between the different genetic codes. It can calculate the distance (dissimilarity) between genetic codes and can be applied with the 20 canonical but also noncanonical amino acids.







Abstract
Genetic code engineering aims to produce organisms that translate genetic information in a different way from that prescribed by the standard genetic code. This endeavor could eventually lead to genetic isolation, where an organism that operates under a different genetic code will not be able to transfer functional genes with other living species, thereby standing behind a genetic firewall. It is not clear however, how distinct the code should be, or how to measure the distance. We have developed a metric (&#916;code) where we assigned polarity indices (clog&#8197;D7) to amino acids to calculate the distances between pairs of genetic codes. We then calculated the distance between a set of 204 genetic codes, including the 24 known distinct natural codes, 11 extreme&#8208;distance codes created computationally, nine theoretical special purpose codes from literature and 160 codes in which canonical amino acids were replaced by noncanonical chemical analogues. The metric can be used for building strategies towards creating semantically alienated organisms, and testing the strength of genetic firewalls. This metric provides the basis for a map of the genetic codes that could guide future efforts towards novel biochemical worlds, biosafety and deep barcoding applications.

         <title>Metabolic Glycoengineering with Azide&#8208; and Alkene&#8208;Modified Hexosamines: Quantification of Sialic Acid Levels</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 7, Page 1243-1251, April 6, 2021. </description>

Where do the sugars go? This is the question when synthetic monosaccharide derivatives are added to the culture medium of cells during metabolic glycoengineering (MGE). We studied the effect of MGE on cellular sialic acid levels and found marked differences between the cell interior and the cell surface.







Abstract
Metabolic glycoengineering (MGE) is an established method to incorporate chemical reporter groups into cellular glycans for subsequent bioorthogonal labeling. The method has found broad application for the visualization and isolation of glycans allowing their biological roles to be probed. Furthermore, targeting of drugs to cancer cells that present high concentrations of sialic acids on their surface is an attractive approach. We report the application of a labeling reaction using 1,2&#8208;diamino&#8208;4,5&#8208;methylenedioxybenzene for the quantification of sialic acid derivates after MGE with various azide&#8208; and alkene&#8208;modified ManNAc, GlcNAc, and GalNAc derivatives. We followed the time course of sialic acid production and were able to detect sialic acids modified with the chemical reporter group &#8211; not only after addition of ManNAc derivatives to the cell culture. A cyclopropane&#8208;modified ManNAc derivative, being a model for the corresponding cyclopropene analog, which undergoes fast inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder reactions with 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazines, resulted in the highest incorporation efficiency. Furthermore, we investigated whether feeding the cells with natural and unnatural ManNAc derivative results in increased levels of sialic acids and found that this is strongly dependent on the investigated cell type and cell fraction. For HEK 293T cells, a strong increase in free sialic acids in the cell interior was found, whereas cell&#8208;surface sialic acid levels are only moderately increased.

Type&#8208;III copper proteins are ubiquitous among organisms and catalyze the transfer and activation of molecular oxygen. Tyrosinases hydroxylate monophenols and oxidize the corresponding diphenols, whereas catechol oxidases have only the latter activity. The substrate preference of the two subgroups is controlled by amino acids around the two copper ions, which guide the similar type&#8208;III copper centers into different catalytic pathways. The produced quinones polymerize to melanins, resulting in the browning of fruits and human skin, hair, and eye color. More information can be found in the minireview by I. Kampatsikas and A. Rompel et&#8197;al.

To get one step closer to making fluorescence microscopy as easy as filling out shapes in a children's coloring book, we have developed a novel strategy for generating DNA&#8208; and PNA&#8208;based protein&#8211;oligonucleotide conjugates. We use a chemo&#8208;enzymatic, click chemistry&#8211;based approach via the TubTag to generate our conjugates as depicted in the magnifying glass. Those proteins can readily be used to &#8220;paint&#8221; our cell for fluorescence microscopy. More information can be found in the communication by J. Schwach, A. Stengl et&#8197;al. Cover design: J. Schwach.

The evolutionary drive towards specificity has developed individual enzymes for specific reactions; however, some ancient proteins/enzymes display promiscuous substrate specificity, which is central theme of the image. We have shown that cytochrome c, one of the oldest members of the protein family, known for electron transport and peroxidative properties in lipid membranes, is also capable of performing proton transfer, but only in membrane&#8208;mimetic media. We discovered that His18, close to the hemin group, is mainly responsible for proton abstraction. This result is not only important in evolutionary perspectives, but also exemplifies the differential behavior of biomolecules in response to their surroundings. More information can be found in the full paper by S. Maiti et&#8197;al.

RNA under the spotlight: Chemical reactions used to probe RNA structure combined with deep sequencing helps us towards obtaining a holistic understanding of how RNA structure can be used to control RNA biology. This review looks at how advances in chemical methods merged with transcriptome&#8208;wide RNA probing could extend our understanding of RNA structure and function in normal cells and disease.







Abstract
RNA molecules can fold into complex two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional shapes that are critical for their function. Chemical probes have long been utilized to interrogate RNA structure and are now considered invaluable resources in the goal of relating structure to function. Recently, the power of deep sequencing and careful chemical probe design have merged, permitting researchers to obtain a holistic understanding of how RNA structure can be utilized to control RNA biology transcriptome&#8208;wide. Within this review, we outline the recent advancements in chemical probe design for interrogating RNA structures inside cells and discuss the recent advances in our understanding of RNA biology through the lens of chemical probing.

         <title>Similar but Still Different: Which Amino Acid Residues Are Responsible for Varying Activities in Type&#8208;III Copper Enzymes?</title>

Cause and effect: The mode of action of PPOs is still elusive. Here, we summarize the current understanding of the amino acids located around the dicopper active center and the mutations that were applied to these residues that control the substrate selectivity and activity of PPOs, and thereby decide whether a PPO reacts as a tyrosinase or a catechol oxidase.







Abstract
Type&#8208;III copper enzymes like polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) are ubiquitous among organisms and play a significant role in the formation of pigments. PPOs comprise different enzyme groups, including tyrosinases (TYRs) and catechol oxidases (COs). TYRs catalyze the o&#8208;hydroxylation of monophenols and the oxidation of o&#8208;diphenols to the corresponding o&#8208;quinones (EC&#8197;1.14.18.1). In contrast, COs only catalyze the oxidation of o&#8208;diphenols to the corresponding o&#8208;quinones (EC&#8197;1.10.3.1). To date (August 2020), 102 PDB entries encompassing 18 different proteins from 16 organisms and several mutants have been reported, identifying key residues for tyrosinase activity. The structural similarity between TYRs and COs, especially within and around the active center, complicates the elucidation of their modes of action on a structural basis. However, mutagenesis studies illuminate residues that influence the two activities and show that crystallography on its own cannot elucidate the enzymatic activity mode. Several amino acid residues around the dicopper active center have been proposed to play an essential role in the two different activities. Herein, we critically review the role of all residues identified so far that putatively affect the two activities of PPOs.

         <title>Biological Relevance of RGD&#8208;Integrin Subtype&#8208;Specific Ligands in Cancer</title>

Specific ligands for the right integrin in the right tumor: RGD&#8208;integrins &#945;v&#946;3 and &#945;5&#946;1 are the most studied in cancer. Despite similarities in extracellular matrix recognition, integrin expression and function can differ from one tumor to another. Ligands highly selective for each subtype represent a breakthrough to understand their particularities and to specifically address their respective functions in tumors.







Abstract
Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane proteins able to connect cells with the micro&#8208;environment. They represent a family of receptors involved in almost all the hallmarks of cancer. Integrins recognizing the Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp (RGD) peptide in their natural extracellular matrix ligands have been particularly investigated as tumoral therapeutic targets. In the last 30&#8197;years, intense research has been dedicated to designing specific RGD&#8208;like ligands able to discriminate selectively the different RGD&#8208;recognizing integrins. Chemists&#8242; efforts have led to the proposition of modified peptide or peptidomimetic libraries to be used for tumor targeting and/or tumor imaging. Here we review, from the biological point of view, the rationale underlying the need to clearly delineate each RGD&#8208;integrin subtype by selective tools. We describe the complex roles of RGD&#8208;integrins (mainly the most studied &#945;v&#946;3 and &#945;5&#946;1 integrins) in tumors, the steps towards selective ligands and the current usefulness of such ligands. Although the impact of integrins in cancer is well acknowledged, the biological characteristics of each integrin subtype in a specific tumor are far from being completely resolved. Selective ligands might help us to reconsider integrins as therapeutic targets in specific clinical settings.

         <title>Optical Biosensors for Virus Detection: Prospects for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2/COVID&#8208;19</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 7, Page 1176-1189, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast facts at the frontline: Optical biosensors have led to significant advancements in virus detection and imaging capabilities. Coupled with advanced instrumentation, they have enabled higher sensitivities while increasing the rate at which samples can be tested. These techniques can be developed into point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) diagnostics for viral detection and are promising alternatives to detect COVID&#8208;19.







Abstract
The recent pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) has caused huge worldwide disruption due to the lack of available testing locations and equipment. The use of optical techniques for viral detection has flourished in the past 15&#8197;years, providing more reliable, inexpensive, and accurate detection methods. In the current minireview, optical phenomena including fluorescence, surface plasmons, surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), and colorimetry are discussed in the context of detecting virus pathogens. The sensitivity of a viral detection method can be dramatically improved by using materials that exhibit surface plasmons or SERS, but often this requires advanced instrumentation for detection. Although fluorescence and colorimetry lack high sensitivity, they show promise as point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics because of their relatively less complicated instrumentation, ease of use, lower costs, and the fact that they do not require nucleic acid amplification. The advantages and disadvantages of each optical detection method are presented, and prospects for applying optical biosensors in COVID&#8208;19 detection are discussed.

         <title>Site&#8208;Directed Mutagenesis of Modular Polyketide Synthase Ketoreductase Domains for Altered Stereochemical Control</title>

Steering synthesis: Type&#8197;I polyketide synthase ketoreductases (KRs) have been probed by mutagenesis to enforce stereochemical control. Work has focused on isolated KRs excised from megasynthases with diffusible substrates. Herein, we provide an overview of the mutagenesis experiments performed to date for systematic comparison. This information could be harnessed to fine&#8208;tune the creation of polyketide products through engineered biosynthesis.







Abstract
Bacterial modular type&#8197;I polyketide synthases (PKSs) are complex multidomain assembly line proteins that produce a range of pharmaceutically relevant molecules with a high degree of stereochemical control. Due to their colinear properties, they have been considerable targets for rational biosynthetic pathway engineering. Among the domains harbored within these complex assembly lines, ketoreductase (KR) domains have been extensively studied with the goal of altering their stereoselectivity by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, as they confer much of the stereochemical complexity present in pharmaceutically active reduced polyketide scaffolds. Here we review all efforts to date to perform site&#8208;directed mutagenesis on PKS KRs, most of which have been done in the context of excised KR domains on model diffusible substrates such as &#946;&#8208;keto N&#8208;acetyl cysteamine thioesters. We also discuss the challenges around translating the findings of these studies to alter stereocontrol in the context of a complex multidomain enzymatic assembly line.

         <title>Computational Hot&#8208;Spot Analysis of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Receptor Binding Domain/ACE2 Complex**

Too hot to handle: Many coronavirus therapeutics in development target the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein, including a protein&#8211;protein interaction (PPI) between the spike protein receptor&#8208;binding domain and ACE2, a protein on the surface of many human cells. We used computational approaches to predict hot&#8208;spot residues between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RBD and ACE2 to illuminate the molecular underpinnings of this critical PPI.







Abstract
Infection and replication of SARS CoV&#8208;2 (the virus that causes COVID&#8208;19) requires entry to the interior of host cells. In humans, a protein&#8211;protein interaction (PPI) between the SARS CoV&#8208;2 receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) and the extracellular peptidase domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells in the lower respiratory tract is an initial step in the entry pathway. Inhibition of the SARS CoV&#8208;2 RBD/ACE2 PPI is currently being evaluated as a target for therapeutic and/or prophylactic intervention. However, relatively little is known about the molecular underpinnings of this complex. Employing multiple computational platforms, we predicted &#8220;hot&#8208;spot&#8221; residues in a positive&#8208;control PPI (PMI/MDM2) and the CoV&#8208;2 RBD/ACE2 complex. Computational alanine scanning mutagenesis was performed to predict changes in Gibbs&#8217; free energy that are associated with mutating residues at the positive control (PMI/MDM2) or SARS RBD/ACE2 binding interface to alanine. Additionally, we used the Adaptive Poisson&#8208;Boltzmann Solver to calculate macromolecular electrostatic surfaces at the interface of the positive&#8208;control PPI and SARS CoV&#8208;2/ACE2 PPI. Finally, a comparative analysis of hot&#8208;spot residues for SARS&#8208;CoV and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, in complex with ACE2, is provided. Collectively, this study illuminates predicted hot&#8208;spot residues, and clusters, at the SARS CoV&#8208;2 RBD/ACE2 binding interface, potentially guiding the development of reagents capable of disrupting this complex and halting COVID&#8208;19.

         <title>Discovery and Engineering of a Novel Baeyer&#8208;Villiger Monooxygenase with High Normal Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 7, Page 1190-1195, April 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;controllable synthesis: Regioselectivity is essential in Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenase&#8208;mediated regiodivergent conversions of asymmetric ketones to generate esters in organic synthesis. A novel normal&#8208;preferring BVMO from Gordonia sihwensis with superior regioselectivity (97&#8201;:&#8201;3) was identified, engineered, and employed to efficiently synthesize 9&#8208;(nonanoyloxy)nonanoic acid from 10&#8208;ketostearic acid derived from renewable plant oils.







Abstract
Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) are remarkable biocatalysts for the Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation of ketones to generate esters or lactones. The regioselectivity of BVMOs is essential for determining the ratio of the two regioisomeric products (&#8220;normal&#8221; and &#8220;abnormal&#8221;) when catalyzing asymmetric ketone substrates. Starting from a known normal&#8208;preferring BVMO sequence from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 (PpBVMO), a novel BVMO from Gordonia sihwensis (GsBVMO) with higher normal regioselectivity (up to 97/3) was identified. Furthermore, protein engineering increased the specificity constant (kcat/KM) 8.9&#8208;fold to 484&#8197;s&#8722;1&#8201;mM&#8722;1 for 10&#8208;ketostearic acid derived from oleic acid. Consequently, by using the variant GsBVMOC308L as an efficient biocatalyst, 10&#8208;ketostearic acid was efficiently transformed into 9&#8208;(nonanoyloxy)nonanoic acid, with a space&#8208;time yield of 60.5&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;d&#8722;1. This study showed that the mutant with higher regioselectivity and catalytic efficiency could be applied to prepare medium&#8208;chain &#969;&#8208;hydroxy fatty acids through biotransformation of long&#8208;chain aliphatic keto acids derived from renewable plant oils.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Structure&#8208;controllable synthesis&lt;/b&gt;: Regioselectivity is essential in Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenase&#8208;mediated regiodivergent conversions of asymmetric ketones to generate esters in organic synthesis. A novel normal&#8208;preferring BVMO from &lt;i&gt;Gordonia sihwensis&lt;/i&gt; with superior regioselectivity (97&#8201;:&#8201;3) was identified, engineered, and employed to efficiently synthesize 9&#8208;(nonanoyloxy)nonanoic acid from 10&#8208;ketostearic acid derived from renewable plant oils.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) are remarkable biocatalysts for the Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation of ketones to generate esters or lactones. The regioselectivity of BVMOs is essential for determining the ratio of the two regioisomeric products (&#8220;normal&#8221; and &#8220;abnormal&#8221;) when catalyzing asymmetric ketone substrates. Starting from a known normal&#8208;preferring BVMO sequence from &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas putida&lt;/i&gt; KT2440 (&lt;i&gt;Pp&lt;/i&gt;BVMO), a novel BVMO from &lt;i&gt;Gordonia sihwensis&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Gs&lt;/i&gt;BVMO) with higher normal regioselectivity (up to 97/3) was identified. Furthermore, protein engineering increased the specificity constant (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;) 8.9&#8208;fold to 484&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;mM&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for 10&#8208;ketostearic acid derived from oleic acid. Consequently, by using the variant &lt;i&gt;Gs&lt;/i&gt;BVMO&lt;sub&gt;C308L&lt;/sub&gt; as an efficient biocatalyst, 10&#8208;ketostearic acid was efficiently transformed into 9&#8208;(nonanoyloxy)nonanoic acid, with a space&#8208;time yield of 60.5&#8197;g&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;d&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Antibody Fragment Conjugates for Reversible Staining in Fluorescence Microscopy</title>

Protein&#8208;oligonucleotide conjugates. We present a novel strategy for the efficient and site&#8208;specific generation of nanobody&#8208;oligonucleotide conjugates in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry by Tub&#8208;tag&#8208;mediated conjugation. We show a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept that these conjugates can readily be used for reversible staining in confocal fluorescence microscopy.







Abstract
Antibody conjugates have taken a great leap forward as tools in basic and applied molecular life sciences that was enabled by the development of chemoselective reactions for the site&#8208;specific modification of proteins. Antibody&#8208;oligonucleotide conjugates combine the antibody's target specificity with the reversible, sequence&#8208;encoded binding properties of oligonucleotides like DNAs or peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), allowing sequential imaging of large numbers of targets in a single specimen. In this report, we use the Tub&#8208;tag&#174; technology in combination with Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition for the site&#8208;specific conjugation of single DNA and PNA strands to an eGFP&#8208;binding nanobody. We show binding of the conjugate to recombinant eGFP and subsequent sequence&#8208;specific annealing of fluorescently labelled imager strands. Furthermore, we reversibly stain eGFP&#8208;tagged proteins in human cells, thus demonstrating the suitability of our conjugation strategy to generate antibody&#8208;oligonucleotides for reversible immunofluorescence imaging.

         <title>Trypsiligase&#8208;Catalyzed Labeling of Proteins on Living Cells</title>

Fluorescent fusion proteins: Herein, we describe a biocatalytic approach for the site&#8208;specific bioconjugation of cell&#8208;surface bound proteins by trypsiligase. The reactions are fast, irreversible, without side reactions and completely nontoxic to living cells. Importantly, recognition of the target membrane protein by trypsiligase only requires the introduction of a simple dipeptide sequence at its N terminus.







Abstract
Fluorescent fusion proteins are powerful tools for studying biological processes in living cells, but universal application is limited due to the voluminous size of those tags, which might have an impact on the folding, localization or even the biological function of the target protein. The designed biocatalyst trypsiligase enables site&#8208;directed linkage of small&#8208;sized fluorescence dyes on the N&#8197;terminus of integral target proteins located in the outer membrane of living cells through a stable native peptide bond. The function of the approach was tested by using the examples of covalent derivatization of the transmembrane proteins CD147 as well as the EGF receptor, both presented on human HeLa cells. Specific trypsiligase recognition of the site of linkage was mediated by the dipeptide sequence Arg&#8208;His added to the proteins&#8217; native N&#8197;termini, pointing outside the cell membrane. The labeling procedure takes only about 5 minutes, as demonstrated for couplings of the fluorescence dye tetramethyl rhodamine and the affinity label biotin as well.

         <title>Supramolecular Interaction of Molecular Cage and &#946;&#8208;Galactosidase: Application in Enzymatic Inhibition, Drug Delivery and Antimicrobial Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme inhibitor plays a crucial role in diagnosis of a wide spectrum of diseases related to bacterial infections. We report here the effect of a water&#8208;soluble self&#8208;assembled Pd  II  8  molecular cage towards &#946;&#8208;Galactosidase enzyme activity. The molecular cage is composed of a tetrapyridyl donor (  L  ) and  cis  &#8208;[(en)Pd(NO  3  )  2  ] (en = ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) acceptor and it has a hydrophobic internal cavity. We have observed that the acceptor moiety mainly possesses the ability to inactivate the &#946;&#8208;Galactosidase enzyme activity. Kinetic investigation has revealed that the mode of inhibition is competitive in nature. This inhibition strategy was extended to control the growth of methicillin&#8208;resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  bacteria. The internalization of the Pd(II) cage inside the bacteria was confirmed when bacterial solutions were incubated with curcumin loaded cage. The intrinsic green fluorescence of curcumin made the bacteria glow when put under an optical microscope. Furthermore, this curcumin loaded molecular cage shows an enhanced antibacterial activity. Thus, Pd  II  8  molecular cage is quite attractive due to its dual role as enzyme inhibitor and drug carrier.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic RNA production from NTPs synthesized from&#160;nucleosides and trimetaphosphate</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A mechanism of nucleoside triphosphorylation would have been critical in an evolving &#8220;RNA world&#8221; to provide high&#8208;energy substrates for reactions such as RNA polymerization. However, synthetic approaches to produce ribonucleoside triphosphoates (rNTPs) have suffered from conditions such as high temperatures or high pH that lead to increased RNA degradation, as well as substrate production that cannot sustain replication. Previous reports have demonstrated that cyclic trimetaphosphate (cTmp) can react with nucleosides to form rNTPs under prebiotically&#8208;relevant conditions, but their reaction rates were unknown and the influence of reaction conditions not well&#8208;characterized. Here we established a sensitive assay that allowed for the determination of second&#8208;order rate constants for all four rNTPs, ranging from 1.7 x 10  &#8211;6  to 6.5 x 10  &#8211;6  M  &#8211;1  s  &#8211;1  . The ATP reaction shows a linear dependence on pH and Mg  2+  , and an enthalpy of activation of 88 &#177; 4 kJ/mol. At millimolar nucleoside and cTmp concentrations, the rNTP production rate is sufficient to facilitate RNA synthesis by both T7 RNA polymerase and a polymerase ribozyme. We suggest that the optimized reaction of cTmp with nucleosides may provide a viable connection between prebiotic nucleotide synthesis and RNA replication.</dc:description>

         <title>A bi&#8208;enzymatic cascade pathway towards optically pure FAHFAs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently discovered endogenous mammalian lipids fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs), proved to have anti&#8208;inflammatory and anti&#8208;diabetic effects. Due to their extremely low abundancies in vivo , forging a feasible scenario for FAHFA synthesis is critical for their use in uncovering biological mechanism or clinical trials. Here, we showcase a fully enzymatic approach, a novel in vitro bi&#8208;enzymatic cascade system, enabling an effective conversion of nature&#8208;abundant fatty acids into FAHFAs. Two hydratases from L. acidophilus were used for converting unsaturated fatty acids to various enantiomeric hydroxy fatty acids, followed by esterification with another fatty acid catalyzed by C. antarctica lipase A (CALA). Various FAHFAs were synthesized in a semi&#8208;preparative scale using this bi&#8208;enzymatic approach in a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step operation mode. In all, we demonstrate that hydratase&#8208;CALA system offers a promising route for synthesis of optically pure structure&#8208;diverse FAHFAs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Reconstructed Common Ancestor of the Fatty Acid Photo&#8208;decarboxylase Clade Shows Photo&#8208;decarboxylation Activity and Increased Thermostability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme resurrection strikes again: Ancestral sequence reconstruction was applied to a putative photo&#8208;decarboxylases clade. One common ancestor showed up to 12&#8208;fold production yield, a 15&#8201;&#176;C increase in thermostability and up to 20&#8208;fold improvement in residual activity when incubated at 50&#8201;&#176;C. Ancestral sequence reconstruction proved to be a valuable tool to introduce valid mutations to a little understood fatty acid photo&#8208;decarboxylase.







Abstract
Light&#8208;dependent enzymes are a rare type of biocatalyst with high potential for research and biotechnology. A recently discovered fatty acid photo&#8208;decarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis NC64A (CvFAP) converts fatty acids to the corresponding hydrocarbons only when irradiated with blue light (400 to 520&#8197;nm). To expand the available catalytic diversity for fatty acid decarboxylation, we reconstructed possible ancestral decarboxylases from a set of 12 extant sequences that were classified under the fatty acid decarboxylases clade within the glucose&#8208;methanol choline (GMC) oxidoreductase family. One of the resurrected enzymes (ANC1) showed activity in the decarboxylation of fatty acids, showing that the clade indeed contains several photo&#8208;decarboxylases. ANC1 has a 15&#8201;&#176;C higher melting temperature (Tm) than the extant CvFAP. Its production yielded 12&#8208;fold more protein than this wild type decarboxylase, which offers practical advantages for the biochemical investigation of this photoenzyme. Homology modelling revealed amino acid substitutions to more hydrophilic residues at the surface and shorter flexible loops compared to the wild type. Using ancestral sequence reconstruction, we have expanded the existing pool of confirmed fatty acid photo&#8208;decarboxylases, providing access to a more robust catalyst for further development via directed evolution.

         <title>Biochemical Investigation of the Interaction of pICln, RioK1 and COPR5 with the PRMT5&#8211;MEP50 Complex</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Determination of a PPI interface: The adaptor protein binding site of PRMT5 has been identified and studied by using synthetic peptides. A cocrystal structure of the PRMT5 TIM&#8208;barrel domain and a RioK1&#8208;derived peptide highlights the site of interaction.







Abstract
The PRMT5&#8211;MEP50 methyltransferase complex plays a key role in various cancers and is regulated by different protein&#8211;protein interactions. Several proteins have been reported to act as adaptor proteins that recruit substrate proteins to the active site of PRMT5 for the methylation of arginine residues. To define the interaction between these adaptor proteins and PRMT5, we employed peptide truncation and mutation studies and prepared truncated protein constructs. We report the characterisation of the interface between the TIM barrel of PRMT5 and the adaptor proteins pICln, RioK1 and COPR5, and identify the consensus amino acid sequence GQF[D/E]DA[E/D] involved in binding. Protein crystallography revealed that the RioK1 derived peptide interacts with a novel PPI site.

         <dc:description>
Ranging from small&#8208;molecule metal complexes to supramolecular assembles, bioinspired catalysts possess many exciting properties that could address salient challenges in industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing. Inspired by natural enzymes, these systems have high activity, enantioselectivity, and aqueous solubility. Recent advances in synthetic enzyme models have improved our understanding of complicated biological enzymatic processes and enabled the production of catalysts with increased efficiency.







Abstract
Biomimetic catalysts, ranging from small&#8208;molecule metal complexes to supramolecular assembles, possess many exciting properties that could address salient challenges in industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing. Inspired by natural enzymes, these biohybrid catalytic systems demonstrate superior characteristics, including high activity, enantioselectivity, and enhanced aqueous solubility, over their fully synthetic counterparts. However, instability and limitations in the prediction of structure&#8208;function relationships are major drawbacks that often prevent the application of biomimetic catalysts outside of the laboratory. Despite these obstacles, recent advances in synthetic enzyme models have improved our understanding of complicated biological enzymatic processes and enabled the production of catalysts with increased efficiency. This review outlines important developments and future prospects for the design and application of bioinspired and biohybrid systems at multiple length scales for important, biologically relevant, clean energy transformations.

         <title>Chemical Biology Tools To Investigate Malaria Parasites</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ghost hunting: Malaria tropica has been haunting mankind for centuries, but investigating the biology of the causative agent, the protozoan parasite P. falciparum, remains challenging. Herein, we describe ready&#8208;to&#8208;use, non&#8208;genetic, small molecular probes from the field of chemical biology that have been, or may be, used to interrogate the complex infection cycle, with an emphasis on infected red blood cells.







Abstract
Parasitic diseases like malaria tropica have been shaping human evolution and history since the beginning of mankind. After infection, the response of the human host ranges from asymptomatic to severe and may culminate in death. Therefore, proper examination of the parasite's biology is pivotal to deciphering unique molecular, biochemical and cell biological processes, which in turn ensure the identification of treatment strategies, such as potent drug targets and vaccine candidates. However, implementing molecular biology methods for genetic manipulation proves to be difficult for many parasite model organisms. The development of fast and straightforward applicable alternatives, for instance small&#8208;molecule probes from the field of chemical biology, is essential. In this review, we will recapitulate the highlights of previous molecular and chemical biology approaches that have already created insight and understanding of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. We discuss current developments from the field of chemical biology and explore how their application could advance research into this parasite in the future. We anticipate that the described approaches will help to close knowledge gaps in the biology of P. falciparum and we hope that researchers will be inspired to use these methods to gain knowledge &#8211; with the aim of ending this devastating disease.

         <title>Optimized Biocatalytic Synthesis of 2&#8208;Selenopyrimidine Nucleosides by Transglycosylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Se for yourself: We present a biocatalytic synthesis of selenium&#8208;containing pyrimidine nucleosides. Optimization of the reaction conditions improved the solubility and stability of the sensitive starting materials as well as previously observed low conversions. This approach offers a concise alternative to traditionally employed multistep routes to these compounds.







Abstract
Selenium&#8208;modified nucleosides are powerful tools to study the structure and function of nucleic acids and their protein interactions. The widespread application of 2&#8208;selenopyrimidine nucleosides is currently limited by low yields in established synthetic routes. Herein, we describe the optimization of the synthesis of 2&#8208;Se&#8208;uridine and 2&#8208;Se&#8208;thymidine derivatives by thermostable nucleoside phosphorylases in transglycosylation reactions using natural uridine or thymidine as sugar donors. Reactions were performed at 60 or 80&#8201;&#176;C and at pH&#8197;9 under hypoxic conditions to improve the solubility and stability of the 2&#8208;Se&#8208;nucleobases in aqueous media. To optimize the conversion, the reaction equilibria in analytical transglycosylation reactions were studied. The equilibrium constants of phosphorolysis of the 2&#8208;Se&#8208;pyrimidines were between 5 and 10, and therefore differ by an order of magnitude from the equilibrium constants of any other known case. Hence, the thermodynamic properties of the target nucleosides are inherently unfavorable, and this complicates their synthesis significantly. A tenfold excess of sugar donor was needed to achieve 40&#8722;48&#8201;% conversion to the target nucleoside. Scale&#8208;up of the optimized conditions provided four Se&#8208;containing nucleosides in 6&#8211;40&#8201;% isolated yield, which compares favorably to established chemical routes.

     alt="Optimized Biocatalytic Synthesis of 2&#8208;Selenopyrimidine Nucleosides by Transglycosylation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Se for yourself&lt;/b&gt;: We present a biocatalytic synthesis of selenium&#8208;containing pyrimidine nucleosides. Optimization of the reaction conditions improved the solubility and stability of the sensitive starting materials as well as previously observed low conversions. This approach offers a concise alternative to traditionally employed multistep routes to these compounds.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selenium&#8208;modified nucleosides are powerful tools to study the structure and function of nucleic acids and their protein interactions. The widespread application of 2&#8208;selenopyrimidine nucleosides is currently limited by low yields in established synthetic routes. Herein, we describe the optimization of the synthesis of 2&#8208;Se&#8208;uridine and 2&#8208;Se&#8208;thymidine derivatives by thermostable nucleoside phosphorylases in transglycosylation reactions using natural uridine or thymidine as sugar donors. Reactions were performed at 60 or 80&#8201;&#176;C and at pH&#8197;9 under hypoxic conditions to improve the solubility and stability of the 2&#8208;Se&#8208;nucleobases in aqueous media. To optimize the conversion, the reaction equilibria in analytical transglycosylation reactions were studied. The equilibrium constants of phosphorolysis of the 2&#8208;Se&#8208;pyrimidines were between 5 and 10, and therefore differ by an order of magnitude from the equilibrium constants of any other known case. Hence, the thermodynamic properties of the target nucleosides are inherently unfavorable, and this complicates their synthesis significantly. A tenfold excess of sugar donor was needed to achieve 40&#8722;48&#8201;% conversion to the target nucleoside. Scale&#8208;up of the optimized conditions provided four Se&#8208;containing nucleosides in 6&#8211;40&#8201;% isolated yield, which compares favorably to established chemical routes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Manufacture of Multilayered Artificial Cell Membranes through Sequential Bilayer Deposition on Emulsion Templates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Running rings around vesicles: We describe a droplet&#8208;based technology to manufacture cell&#8208;sized multilamellar lipid vesicles. Individual membranes are assembled layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer, giving control over the number of induvial layers and their molecular content. We investigated how the biomechanical properties of the structures change with each added layer.







Abstract
Efforts to manufacture artificial cells that replicate the architectures, processes and behaviours of biological cells are rapidly increasing. Perhaps the most commonly reconstructed cellular structure is the membrane, through the use of unilamellar vesicles as models. However, many cellular membranes, including bacterial double membranes, nuclear envelopes, and organelle membranes, are multilamellar. Due to a lack of technologies available for their controlled construction, multilayered membranes are not part of the repertoire of cell&#8208;mimetic motifs used in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. To address this, we developed emulsion&#8208;based technologies that allow cell&#8208;sized multilayered vesicles to be produced layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer, with compositional control over each layer, thus enabling studies that would otherwise remain inaccessible. We discovered that bending rigidities scale with the number of layers and demonstrate inter&#8208;bilayer registration between coexisting liquid&#8211;liquid domains. These technologies will contribute to the exploitation of multilayered membrane structures, paving the way for incorporating protein complexes that span multiple bilayers.

         <title>A comparison of two DNA aptamers for dopamine using homogeneous binding assays</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter and its detection is important for bioanalytical chemistry. Two very different DNA aptamers have been reported for dopamine, one derived from an RNA aptamer (named Apt1) and other obtained via direct aptamer selection (named Apt2). In this study, we used four homogeneous binding assays to compare these two DNA dopamine aptamers. Thiazole orange (TO) fluorescence assay indicated that the Apt2 specifically bound with dopamine with a  K  d  of 2.37 &#181;M, which was consistent with that from the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assay. However, Apt1 had much less TO fluorescence change and also no signal from ITC. By labeling the two ends of the two aptamers by a fluorophore and a quencher, the aptamer beacons showed binding of dopamine only for Apt2. Finally, the label&#8208;free AuNP&#8208;based colorimetric assay showed no difference between these two aptamer sequences, and even non&#8208;binding random DNA showed the same response, indicating the AuNPs were not a good probe for detecting dopamine. Taken the data together, Apt1 does not appear to be able to bind dopamine specifically, while Apt2 showed specific binding and is recommended for developing related biosensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Advanced Understanding of the Electron&#8208;Transfer Pathway of Cytochrome P450s</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The landmark building of our school is the place where we started to solve the first full&#8208;length crystal structure of a self&#8208;sufficient cytochrome P450 (CYP116B46). The building has three main parts that are in an alignment similar to that of the three&#8208;domain CYP116B46. Cytochrome P450s are powerful biocatalysts with potential in many biotechnological applications. The majority of P450s demand redox equivalents that travel from pyridine nucleotides through the electron&#8208;transfer path to the catalytic center, like the lightning descending. In our review, we summarize the current understanding of the P450 electron&#8208;transfer route, with particular focus on the recently reported structures of two types of self&#8208;sufficient P450s. This information should provide important insights into the P450 mechanism studies and engineering. More information can be found in the review by X. Yu, R.&#8208;T. Guo, et&#8197;al.

         <title>Probes for Photoaffinity Labelling of Kinases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light up the kinome. Probes for photoaffinity labelling of kinases are powerful research tools for detecting (off&#8208;)targets of kinase inhibitors, imaging kinases within the cell or identifying binding partners. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the currently available kinase photoaffinity probes and discuss how such probes are designed. We illustrate the applicability with various examples.







Abstract
Protein kinases, one of the largest enzyme superfamilies, regulate many physiological and pathological processes. They are drug targets for multiple human diseases, including various cancer types. Probes for the photoaffinity labelling of kinases are important research tools for the study of members of this enzyme superfamily. In this review, we discuss the design principles of these probes, which are mainly derived from inhibitors targeting the ATP pocket. Overall, insights from crystal structures guide the placement of photoreactive groups and detection tags. This has resulted in a wide variety of probes, of which we provide a comprehensive overview. We also discuss several areas of application of these probes, including the identification of targets and off&#8208;targets of kinase inhibitors, mapping of their binding sites, the development of inhibitor screening assays, the imaging of kinases, and identification of protein binding partners.

         <title>A Mutation&#8208;based Method for Pinpointing a DNA N6&#8208;methyladenine Methyltransferase&#8217;s Modification Site at Single Base Resolution</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA  N  6  &#8208;methyladenine (6mA) has recently received notable attention due to an increased finding of its functional roles in higher eukaryotes. Here we report an enzyme&#8208;assisted chemical labeling method to pinpoint the DNA 6mA MTase&#8217;s substrate modification site at single base resolution. A designed allyl&#8208;substituted MTase cofactor was applied in the catalytic transfer reaction, and the allyl group was installed to the  N  6  &#8208;position of adenine within a specific DNA sequence to form  N  6  &#8208;allyladenine (6aA). The iodination of 6aA allyl group induced the formation of 1,  N  6  &#8208;cyclized adenine which caused mutations during DNA replication by a certain polymerase, and thus the modification site could be precisely detected by a mutation signal. We synthesized 6aA deoxynucleoside and deoxynucleotide model compounds and a 6aA&#8208;containing DNA probe, and screened nine DNA polymerases to eventually work out an optimal system capable of detecting the substrate modification site of a DNA 6mA MTase at single base resolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsic Fluorescence of the Active and the Inactive Functional Forms of Human Thymidylate Synthase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A matter of form: The active and the inactive functional forms of human thymidylate synthase, a long&#8208;known anticancer target, exhibit different intrinsic fluorescence spectra, quantum yields, lifetime profiles and anisotropies. These differences are connected to the conformational changes occurring in the active &#8211; inactive interconversion and provide tools for real&#8208;time identification and quantitation of the two protein forms in solution.







Abstract
The observables associated with protein intrinsic fluorescence &#8211; spectra, time decays, anisotropies &#8211; offer opportunities to monitor in real time and non&#8208;invasively a protein&#8216;s functional form and its interchange with other forms with different functions. We employed these observables to sketch the fluorometric profiles of two functional forms of human thymidylate synthase (hTS), a homodimeric enzyme crucial for cell proliferation and thus targeted by anticancer drugs. The protein takes an active and an inactive form. Stabilization of the latter by peptides that, unlike classical hTS inhibitors, bind it at the monomer/monomer interface offers an alternative inhibition mechanism that promises to avoid the onset of drug resistance in anticancer therapy. The fluorescence features depicted herein can be used as tools to identify and quantify each of the two protein forms in solution, thus making it possible to investigate the kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of the active/inactive conformational interchange. Two examples of fluorometrically monitored interconversion kinetics are provided.

         <title>Approaches to Evaluate the Impact of a Small&#8208;Molecule Binder to a Noncatalytic Site of the Proteasome</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigating the impact of small molecules: There are a number of essential protein&#8211;protein interactions between the 19S regulatory particle and 20S core particle to form the full 26S proteasome. We investigated whether a small&#8208;molecule binder to Rpn&#8208;6, a 19S subunit, could disrupt 26S proteasome activity.







Abstract
Proteasome activity is crucial for cell survival and proliferation. In recent years, small molecules have been discovered that can affect the catalytic activity of the proteasome. Rather than targeting the active sites of the proteasome, it might be possible to affect ubiquitin&#8208;dependent degradation of proteins by limiting the association of the 19S regulatory particle (19S RP) with the 20S core particle (20S CP) of the proteasome. We recently described the discovery of TXS&#8208;8, a peptoid that binds to Rpn&#8208;6. Rpn&#8208;6 is a proteasome&#8208;associated protein that makes critical contacts with the 19S RP and the 20S CP. Herein, we present a general workflow to evaluate the impact of a small&#8208;molecule binder on proteasome activity by using TXS&#8208;8 as an example. This workflow contains three steps in which specific probes or overexpressed proteins in cells are used to determine whether the hydrolysis activity of the proteasome is affected. Although, in our case, TXS&#8208;8 did not affect proteasome activity, our workflow is highly amenable to studying a variety of small&#8208;molecule&#8211;proteasome subunit interactions.

         <title>Application of Neuron&#8208;Selective Fluorescent Probe, NeuA, To Identify Mouse Retinal Degeneration</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As far as the eye can be seen: Developed fluorescent probe, NeuA (NeuO with an acrylamide group), stained healthy mouse retinal neuron cells and discriminated between healthy retina and retina with degenerating photoreceptors by confocal and fluorescent fundus microscopy. These imaging probes can be used as diagnostic and prognostic tools for retinitis pigmentosa in a clinical domain.







Abstract
The retina is part of the central nerve system (CNS) and has various interneurons and sensory neurons such as photoreceptor cells. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited condition that is characterized by photoreceptor degeneration. Herein, we developed a fluorescent probe&#8208;NeuA&#8208;for detecting retinal neuronal cells and applied NeuA to discriminate between healthy and RP retinas. The staining pattern of NeuA in the retinas of healthy and RP mouse models was examined in&#8197;vitro, ex vivo and in&#8197;vivo using confocal microscopy, the fluorescent fundus microscopy and optical coherent tomography (OCT). NeuA strongly stained the outer segment layer of photoreceptor cells and some bipolar cells in the healthy retina, but there was only weak staining in the photoreceptor degenerated retinas. Therefore, NeuA probe can be used as the detecting RP tools in the preclinical conditions.

         <title>Isopenicillin&#8197;N Synthase: Crystallographic Studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thousand words: Isopenicillin&#8197;N synthase drives the central step in penicillin biosynthesis, oxidative cyclisation of a linear tripeptide to form the bicyclic &#946;&#8208;lactam core. Crystal structures of the protein with its substrate, product, trapped reaction intermediates, and diverse substrate analogues paint a rich mechanistic picture of the enzyme in action and deepen our understanding of non&#8208;heme iron enzyme catalysis.







Abstract
Isopenicillin&#8197;N synthase (IPNS) is a non&#8208;heme iron oxidase (NHIO) that catalyses the cyclisation of tripeptide &#948;&#8208;(l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminoadipoyl)&#8208;l&#8208;cysteinyl&#8208;d&#8208;valine (ACV) to bicyclic isopenicillin&#8197;N (IPN). Over the last 25&#8197;years, crystallography has shed considerable light on the mechanism of IPNS catalysis. The first crystal structure, for apo&#8208;IPNS with Mn bound in place of Fe at the active site, reported in 1995, was also the first structure for a member of the wider NHIO family. This was followed by the anaerobic enzyme&#8208;substrate complex IPNS&#8722;Fe&#8722;ACV (1997), this complex plus nitric oxide as a surrogate for co&#8208;substrate dioxygen (1997), and an enzyme product complex (1999). Since then, crystallography has been used to probe many aspects of the IPNS reaction mechanism, by crystallising the protein with a diversity of substrate analogues and triggering the oxidative reaction by using elevated oxygen pressures to force the gaseous co&#8208;substrate throughout protein crystals and maximise synchronicity of turnover in crystallo. In this way, X&#8208;ray structures have been elucidated for a range of complexes closely related to and/or directly derived from key intermediates in the catalytic cycle, thereby answering numerous mechanistic questions that had arisen from solution&#8208;phase experiments, and posing many new ones. The results of these crystallographic studies have, in turn, informed computational experiments that have brought further insight. These combined crystallographic and computational investigations augment and extend the results of earlier spectroscopic analyses and solution phase studies of IPNS turnover, to enrich our understanding of this important protein and the wider NHIO enzyme family.

         <title>Exchange of Proteins in Liposomes through Streptolysin O Pores</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking a pore view of bioreactors: Streptolysin O creates pores in liposome membranes allowing proteins to permeate them. Enzymes including RNA polymerase can be supplied through these pores, allowing RNA to be synthesized in liposomes. The method could broaden the application of liposomes as biochemical reactors.







Abstract
Liposomes, which are vesicles surrounded by lipid membranes, can be used as biochemical reactors by encapsulating various reactions. Accordingly, they are useful for studying cellular functions under controlled conditions that mimic the environment within a cell. However, one of the shortcomings of liposomes as biochemical reactors is the difficulty of introducing or removing proteins due to the impermeability of the membrane. In this study, we established a method for exchanging proteins in liposomes by forming reversible pores in the membrane. We used the toxic protein streptolysin O (SLO); this forms pores in membranes made of phospholipids containing cholesterol that can be closed by the addition of calcium ions. After optimizing the experimental procedure and lipid composition, we observed the exchange of fluorescent proteins (transferrin Alexa Fluor 488 and 647) in 9.9&#8201;% of liposomes. We also introduced T7 RNA polymerase, a 98&#8208;kDa enzyme, and observed RNA synthesis in &#8764;8&#8201;% of liposomes. Our findings establish a new method for controlling the internal protein composition of liposomes, thereby increasing their utility as bioreactors.

         <title>Increased valency improves inhibitory activity of peptides targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a clinically validated target for treating hypercholesterolemia. Peptide&#8208;based PCSK9 inhibitors have attracted pharmaceutical interest, but the effect of multivalency on bioactivity is poorly understood. Here we designed bivalent and tetravalent dendrimers, decorated with the PCSK9 inhibitory peptides Pep2&#8208;8[RRG] or P9&#8208;38, to study relationships between peptide binding affinity, peptide valency, and PCSK9 inhibition. Increased valency resulted in improved PCSK9 inhibition for both peptides, with activity improvements of up to 100&#8208;fold achieved for the P9&#8208;38&#8208;decorated dendrimers compared to monomeric P9&#8208;38 in  in vitro  competition binding assays. Furthermore, the P9&#8208;38&#8208;decorated dendrimers showed improved potency at restoring functional low&#8208;density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor levels and internalizing LDL in the presence of PCSK9, demonstrating significant cell&#8208;based activity at picomolar concentrations. This study demonstrates the potential of increasing valency as a strategy for increasing the efficacy of peptide&#8208;based PCSK9 therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Antibacterial and Anti&#8208;biofilm Activity of the Human Breast Milk Glycoprotein Lactoferrin against Group B Streptococcus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Maternal antimicrobial: Lactoferrin is an antimicrobial glycoprotein that is abundant in human breast milk. Lactoferrin has potent antimicrobial and anti&#8208;biofilm activity against Group B Streptococcus, a bacterial pathogen that causes severe perinatal infections. Additionally, lactoferrin can inhibit streptococcal adherence to human gestational tissues, underscoring its potential utility as an antimicrobial intervention during pregnancy.







Abstract
Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is an encapsulated Gram&#8208;positive human pathogen that causes invasive infections in pregnant hosts and neonates, as well as immunocompromised individuals. Colonization of the human host requires the ability to adhere to mucosal surfaces and circumnavigate the nutritional challenges and antimicrobial defenses associated with the innate immune response. Biofilm formation is a critical process to facilitate GBS survival and establishment of a replicative niche in the vertebrate host. Previous work has shown that the host responds to GBS infection by producing the innate antimicrobial glycoprotein lactoferrin, which has been implicated in repressing bacterial growth and biofilm formation. Additionally, lactoferrin is highly abundant in human breast milk and could serve a protective role against invasive microbial pathogens. This study demonstrates that human breast milk lactoferrin has antimicrobial and anti&#8208;biofilm activity against GBS and inhibits its adherence to human gestational membranes. Together, these results indicate that human milk lactoferrin could be used as a prebiotic chemotherapeutic strategy to limit the impact of bacterial adherence and biofilm formation on GBS&#8208;associated disease outcomes.

         <title>Novel Pet&#8208;Degrading Enzymes: Structure&#8208;Function from a Computational Perspective</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Life and death cycle of plastics: In this review, the strategies adopted by different research groups in order to enhance the stability and catalytic activity of the PETase&#8208;MHETase system for PET depolymerization to make it more suitable for industrial applications are described emphasizing the advantages provided by the use of computational methods to complement and drive experiments.







Abstract
The bacterium strain Ideonella sakaiensis 201&#8208;F6 is able to hydrolyze low&#8208;crystallinity PET films at 30&#8201;&#176;C due to two enzymes named PETase and MHETase. Since its discovery, many efforts have been dedicated to elucidating the structure and features of those two enzymes, and various authors have highlighted the necessity to optimize both the substrate binding site and the global structure in order to enhance the stability and catalytic activity of these PET biocatalysts so as to make them more suitable for industrial applications. In this review, the strategies adopted by different research groups to investigate the structure and functionality of both PETase and MHETase in depth are described, emphasizing the advantages provided by the use of computational methods to complement and drive experiments. Subsequently, the modifications implemented with protein engineering are discussed. The versatility of the enzymes secreted by I. sakaiensis enables the prediction that they will find several applications in the disposal of PET debris, encouraging a prioritization of efforts in this prolific research field.

         <title>Genomic and Targeted Approaches Unveil the Cell Membrane as a Major Target of the Antifungal Cytotoxin Amantelide A</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on chemogenomic profiling coupled with phenotypic responses, we propose the cell membrane and integrated sterols as major targets of amantelide A and hypothesize a putative role of actin in the mechanism of action. Targeted approaches including biophysical measurement of membrane binding activities in the presence and absence of sterols and actin polymerization assays established the mechanism of action.







Abstract
Amantelide A, a polyhydroxylated macrolide isolated from a marine cyanobacterium, displays broad&#8208;spectrum activity against mammalian cells, bacterial pathogens, and marine fungi. We conducted comprehensive mechanistic studies to identify the molecular targets and pathways affected by amantelide A. Our investigations relied on chemical structure similarities with compounds of known mechanisms, yeast knockout mutants, yeast chemogenomic profiling, and direct biochemical and biophysical methods. We established that amantelide A exerts its antifungal action by binding to ergosterol&#8208;containing membranes followed by pore formation and cell death, a mechanism partially shared with polyene antifungals. Binding assays demonstrated that amantelide A also binds to membranes containing epicholesterol or mammalian cholesterol, thus suggesting that the cytotoxicity to mammalian cells might be due to its affinity to cholesterol&#8208;containing membranes. However, membrane interactions were not completely dependent on sterols. Yeast chemogenomic profiling suggested additional direct or indirect effects on actin. Accordingly, we performed actin polymerization assays, which suggested that amantelide A also promotes actin polymerization in cell&#8208;free systems. However, the C&#8208;33 acetoxy derivative amantelide B showed a similar effect on actin dynamics in vitro but no significant activity against yeast. Overall, these studies suggest that the membrane effects are the most functionally relevant for amantelide A mechanism of action.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Sinapigladioside, an Antifungal Isothiocyanate from Burkholderia Symbionts</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sinapigladioside is a rare isothiocyanate&#8208;bearing natural product from beetle&#8208;associated bacteria (  Burkholderia gladioli  ) that may protect the beetle offspring against entomopathogenic fungi. The biosynthetic origin of sinapigladioside has been elusive, and little is known about bacterial isothiocyanate biosynthesis in general. On the basis of stable&#8208;isotope labeling, bioinformatics, and mutagenesis we identified the sinapigladioside biosynthesis gene cluster in the symbiont and found that an isonitrile synthase plays a key role in the biosynthetic pathway. Genome mining and network analyses indicate that related gene clusters are distributed across various bacterial phyla including producers of both nitriles and isothiocyanates. Our findings support a model for bacterial isothiocyanate biosynthesis by sulfur transfer onto isonitrile precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeting TRIM Proteins: A Quest towards Drugging an Emerging Protein Class</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It can be hard to get TRIM: TRIM proteins, the largest subfamily of single polypeptide RING E3 ligases, are currently gaining attention as targets for drug development. However, developing effective targeting options for TRIMs is challenged by their multidomain scaffolding nature correlating with multifunctional biological roles. Herein, we highlight our current understanding of TRIMs and discuss potential targeting options.







Abstract
The ubiquitylation machinery regulates several fundamental biological processes from protein homeostasis to a wide variety of cellular signaling pathways. As a consequence, its dysregulation is linked to diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration, and autoimmunity. With this review, we aim to highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting E3 ligases, with a special focus on an emerging class of RING ligases, named tri&#8208;partite motif (TRIM) proteins, whose role as targets for drug development is currently gaining pharmaceutical attention. TRIM proteins exert their catalytic activity as scaffolds involved in many protein&#8211;protein interactions, whose multidomains and adapter&#8208;like nature make their druggability very challenging.

     alt="Targeting TRIM Proteins: A Quest towards Drugging an Emerging Protein Class"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It can be hard to get TRIM&lt;/b&gt;: TRIM proteins, the largest subfamily of single polypeptide RING E3 ligases, are currently gaining attention as targets for drug development. However, developing effective targeting options for TRIMs is challenged by their multidomain scaffolding nature correlating with multifunctional biological roles. Herein, we highlight our current understanding of TRIMs and discuss potential targeting options.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ubiquitylation machinery regulates several fundamental biological processes from protein homeostasis to a wide variety of cellular signaling pathways. As a consequence, its dysregulation is linked to diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration, and autoimmunity. With this review, we aim to highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting E3 ligases, with a special focus on an emerging class of RING ligases, named tri&#8208;partite motif (TRIM) proteins, whose role as targets for drug development is currently gaining pharmaceutical attention. TRIM proteins exert their catalytic activity as scaffolds involved in many protein&#8211;protein interactions, whose multidomains and adapter&#8208;like nature make their druggability very challenging. Herein, we give an overview of the current understanding of this class of single polypeptide RING E3 ligases and discuss potential targeting options.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Arylphosphonate&#8208;Tethered Porphyrins: Fluorescence Silencing Speaks a Metal Language in Living Enterocytes**

Pinpointing metals: Arylphosphonic acid fluorophores with a porphyrin core produced unique fluorescent behavior in response to each of the biologically significant metal ions studied. Thus they provide an expandable and engineerable platform for the development of improved, targeted fluorescence sensors suitable for in&#8197;vivo applications to determine and visualize metals in tissues during disease progression.







Abstract
We report the application of a highly versatile and engineerable novel sensor platform to monitor biologically significant and toxic metal ions in live human Caco&#8208;2 enterocytes. The extended conjugation between the fluorescent porphyrin core and metal ions through aromatic phenylphosphonic acid tethers generates a unique turn off and turn on fluorescence and, in addition, shifts in absorption and emission spectra for zinc, cobalt, cadmium and mercury. The reported fluorescent probes p&#8208;H8TPPA and m&#8208;H8TPPA can monitor a wide range of metal ion concentrations via fluorescence titration and also via fluorescence decay curves. Cu&#8208; and Zn&#8208;induced turn off fluorescence can be differentially reversed by the addition of common chelators. Both p&#8208;H8TPPA and m&#8208;H8TPPA readily pass the mammalian cellular membrane due to their amphipathic character as confirmed by confocal microscopic imaging of living enterocytes.

         <title>Structural Insights into Malic Enzyme Variants Favoring an Unnatural Redox Cofactor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From A to C: Structural rules for engineering NAD&#8208;dependent malic enzymes to favor the unnatural redox cofactor NCD are revealed. The residues at positions 346 and 401 act as &#8220;gatekeepers&#8221;, determining the volume of the adenine moiety binding cavity and playing an important role in cofactor recognition. These rules could help to engineer a variety of NCD&#8208;favoring enzymes.







Abstract
The use of nicotinamide cytosine dinucleotide (NCD), a biocompatible nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD) analogue, is of great scientific and biotechnological interest. Several redox enzymes have been devised to favor NCD, and have been successfully applied in creating NCD&#8208;dependent redox systems. However, molecular interactions between cofactor and protein have still to be disclosed in order to guide further engineering efforts. Here we report the structural analysis of an NCD&#8208;favoring malic enzyme (ME) variant derived from Escherichia coli. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure data revealed that the residues located at position 346 and 401 in ME acted as the &#8220;gatekeepers&#8221; of the adenine moiety binding cavity. When Arg346 was substituted with either acidic or aromatic residues, the corresponding mutants showed substantially reduced NCD preference. Inspired by these observations, we generated Lactobacillus helveticus derived d&#8208;lactate dehydrogenase variants at Ile177, the counterpart to Arg346 in ME, and found a similar trend in terms of cofactor preference changes. As many NAD&#8208;dependent oxidoreductases share key structural features, our results provide guidance for protein engineering to obtain more NCD&#8208;favoring variants.

         <title>Tuning the Transglycosylation Reaction of a GH11 Xylanase by a Delicate Enhancement of its Thumb Flexibility</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shifting the balance: Glycoside hydrolases are attractive tools for the enzymatic synthesis of carbohydrates. We used the xylanase from B. circulans (BCX) to study the interplay between active&#8208;site flexibility and the transglycosylation reaction. A point mutation that enhances the flexibility and dynamics of BCX active site shifts the balance of the enzymatic reaction toward transglycosylation.







Abstract
Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) are attractive tools for multiple biotechnological applications. In conjunction with their hydrolytic function, GHs can perform transglycosylation under specific conditions. In nature, oligosaccharide synthesis is performed by glycosyltransferases (GTs); however, the industrial use of GTs is limited by their instability in solution. A key difference between GTs and GHs is the flexibility of their binding site architecture. We have used the xylanase from Bacillus circulans (BCX) to study the interplay between active&#8208;site flexibility and transglycosylation. Residues of the BCX &#8220;thumb&#8221; were substituted to increase the flexibility of the enzyme binding site. Replacement of the highly conserved residue P116 with glycine shifted the balance of the BCX enzymatic reaction toward transglycosylation. The effects of this point mutation on the structure and dynamics of BCX were investigated by NMR spectroscopy. The P116G mutation induces subtle changes in the configuration of the thumb and enhances the millisecond dynamics of the active site. Based on our findings, we propose the remodelling of the GH enzymes glycon site flexibility as a strategy to improve the transglycosylation efficiency of these biotechnologically important catalysts.

         <title>Production of the Carboxylate Reductase from Nocardia otitidiscaviarum in a Soluble, Active Form for in&#8197;vitro Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalytic reduction of carboxylates: Optimization of cultivation parameters and host strain selection were fundamental to decreasing the formation of inclusion bodies and enhancing the production of NoCAR, which was able to reduce up to 65&#8197;mM sodium benzoate to benzaldehyde in 24&#8197;h with integrated in&#8197;vitro recycling of NADPH and ATP.







Abstract
Accessing aldehydes from carboxylate moieties is often a challenging task. In this regard, carboxylate reductases (CARs) are promising catalysts provided by nature that are able to accomplish this task in just one step, avoiding over&#8208;reduction to the alcohol product. However, the heterologous expression of CARs can be quite difficult due to the excessive formation of insoluble protein, thus hindering further characterization and application of the enzyme. Here, the heterologous production of the carboxylate reductase from Nocardia otitidiscaviarum (NoCAR) was optimized by a combination of i) optimized cultivation conditions, ii) post&#8208;translational modification with a phosphopantetheinyl transferase and iii) selection of an appropriate expression strain. Especially, the selection of Escherichia coli tuner cells as host had a strong effect on the final 110&#8208;fold increase in the specific activity of NoCAR. This highly active NoCAR was used to reduce sodium benzoate to benzaldehyde, and it was successfully assembled with an in&#8197;vitro regeneration of ATP and NADPH, being capable of reducing about 30&#8197;mM sodium benzoate with high selectivity in only 2&#8197;h of reaction.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Hydrocarbon Conjugation and Cyclisation in Synthetic Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strength in weakness: Selective and high&#8208;yielding late&#8208;stage modifications to unprotected synthetic peptides and proteins are enabled by S&#8208;alkylation of cysteine by using weakly electrophilic alkyl halides and zinc complexes. Under neutral conditions, iodoalkanes do not compromise selectivity for cysteine: Zn2+ can bind other amino acids but only Cys is alkylated.







Abstract
The conventional S&#8208;alkylation of cysteine relies upon using activated electrophiles. Here we demonstrate high&#8208;yielding and selective S&#8208;alkylation and S&#8208;lipidation of cysteines in unprotected synthetic peptides and proteins by using weak electrophiles and a Zn2+ promoter. Linear or branched iodoalkanes can S&#8208;alkylate cysteine in an unprotected 38&#8208;residue Myc peptide fragment and in a 91&#8208;residue miniprotein Omomyc, thus highlighting selective late&#8208;stage synthetic modifications. Metal&#8208;assisted cysteine alkylation is also effective for incorporating dehydroalanine into unprotected peptides and for peptide cyclisation via aliphatic thioether crosslinks, including customising macrocycles to stabilise helical peptides for enhanced uptake and delivery to proteins inside cells. Chemoselective and efficient late&#8208;stage Zn2+&#8208;promoted cysteine alkylation in unprotected peptides and proteins promises many useful applications.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Strength in weakness&lt;/b&gt;: Selective and high&#8208;yielding late&#8208;stage modifications to unprotected synthetic peptides and proteins are enabled by S&#8208;alkylation of cysteine by using weakly electrophilic alkyl halides and zinc complexes. Under neutral conditions, iodoalkanes do not compromise selectivity for cysteine: Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can bind other amino acids but only Cys is alkylated.

         <title>Recent Advances of DNA Tetrahedra for Therapeutic Delivery and Biosensing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional nanodevices: DNA tetrahedra represent a versatile construct that can be functionalized for numerous purposes including the delivery of small molecules and oligonucleotide therapeutics to the cell as well as a range of applications for biosensing. In this minireview, a number of exciting recent advances in functional nanodevices based on this intriguing structure are highlighted.







Abstract
The chemical and self&#8208;assembly properties of nucleic acids make them ideal for the construction of discrete structures and stimuli&#8208;responsive devices for a diverse array of applications. Amongst the various three&#8208;dimensional assemblies, DNA tetrahedra are of particular interest, as these structures have been shown to be readily taken up by the cell, by the process of caveolin&#8208;mediated endocytosis, without the need for transfection agents. Moreover, these structures can be readily modified with a diverse range of pendant groups to confer greater functionality. This minireview highlights recent advances related to applications of this interesting DNA structure including the delivery of therapeutic agents ranging from small molecules to oligonucleotides in addition to its use for sensing and imaging various species within the cell.

         <title>Fluorophosphonates on&#8208;Demand: A General and Simplified Approach toward Fluorophosphonate Synthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not too demanding: A robust and purification&#8208;free, one&#8208;step synthesis has been developed to enable the on&#8208;demand preparation of structurally diverse fluorophosphonates from a stable, and storable &#8220;toolbox&#8221; of readily accessible p&#8208;nitrophenylphosphonates. Additionally, a reaction&#8208;to&#8208;assay protocol is highlighted that further facilitates the rapid screening of these valuable activity&#8208;based probes.







Abstract
Herein, we report a general and simplified synthesis of fluorophosphonates directly from p&#8208;nitrophenylphosphonates. This FP on&#8208;demand reaction is mediated by a commercially available polymer&#8208;supported fluoride reagent that produces a variety (25 examples) of fluorophosphonates in high yields while only requiring reagent filtration for pure fluorophosphonate isolation. This reaction protocol facilitates the rapid profiling of serine hydrolases with diverse and novel sets of activated phosphonates with differential proteome reactivity. Moreover, slight modification of the procedure into a reaction&#8208;to&#8208;assay format has enabled additional screening efficiency.

         <title>Co&#8208;occurring Congeners Reveal the Position of Enantiomeric Amino Acids in Nonribosomal Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The position of enantiomeric amino acid residues in some nonribosomal peptides can be revealed by Marfey's analysis of co&#8208;occurring minor congeners. This concept does not rely on genome sequencing and is an alternative to laborious approaches based on partial peptide hydrolysis or the synthesis of diastereomers.







Abstract
The absolute configuration of the constituent amino acids in microbial nonribosomal peptides is typically determined by Marfey's method after total hydrolysis of the peptide. A challenge to structure elucidation arises when both d and l enantiomeric configurations of an amino acid are present. Determining the actual position of each amino acid enantiomer within the peptide sequence typically requires laborious approaches based on peptide partial hydrolysis or even total synthesis of the possible diastereomers. Herein, an alternative solution is discussed based on the homogeneous backbone chirality that governs all peptides biosynthesized by a common nonribosomal peptide synthetase. The information on configuration provided by Marfey's analysis of co&#8208;occurring minor congeners can reveal unequivocally the stereochemical sequence of the whole peptide family.

         <title>Electron Microscopy Imaging Applications of Room Temperature Ionic Liquids in the Biological Field &#8211; A Review</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For biological imaging using electron microscopy (EM), the use of room&#8208;temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) has been proposed as an alternative to traditional lengthy preparation methods. With their low vapour pressures and conductivity, RTILs can be applied onto hard&#8208;to&#8208;image soft and/or wet samples without dehydration &#8211; allowing for a more representative, hydrated state of material and opening the possibility for visualization of  in situ  physiological processes using conventional EM systems. However, RTILs have yet to be utilized to their full potential by microscopists and microbiologists alike. To this end, this review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of biological applications of RTILs for EM to bridge the RTIL,  in situ  microscopy, and biological communities. We outline future research avenues for the use of RTILs for the EM observation of biological samples, notably i) RTIL selection and optimization, ii) applications for live cell processes and iii) electron beam and ionic liquid interaction studies.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Reversed&#8208;Phase Flash Chromatography Purification of Peptides and Chemically Modified Insulins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Purification of peptides made easy: Automated flash chromatography using reversed&#8208;phase high&#8208;performance columns and low&#8208;to&#8208;medium pressure is an alternative to HPLC. It enables the purification of peptides that are poorly soluble or very hydrophobic.







Abstract
Preparative reversed&#8208;phase HPLC is the established method for the purification of peptides, but has significant limitations. We systematically investigated the use of high&#8208;performance reversed&#8208;phase flash chromatography (HPFC) to rapidly purify laboratory&#8208;scale quantities of crude, synthetic peptides and chemically modified insulins. We demonstrated these methods for a diverse set of peptides, including short, medium, and long peptides. Depending on the purity profile of the peptide, HPFC can be used either as the sole purification method, or as a pre&#8208;purification method prior to final HPLC purification. Furthermore, HPFC is suitable for the purification of peptides that are not fully in solution. We provide guidelines for the HPFC of synthetic peptides and small proteins, including the choice of columns, eluents, and gradients.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Purification of peptides made easy&lt;/b&gt;: Automated flash chromatography using reversed&#8208;phase high&#8208;performance columns and low&#8208;to&#8208;medium pressure is an alternative to HPLC. It enables the purification of peptides that are poorly soluble or very hydrophobic.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preparative reversed&#8208;phase HPLC is the established method for the purification of peptides, but has significant limitations. We systematically investigated the use of high&#8208;performance reversed&#8208;phase flash chromatography (HPFC) to rapidly purify laboratory&#8208;scale quantities of crude, synthetic peptides and chemically modified insulins. We demonstrated these methods for a diverse set of peptides, including short, medium, and long peptides. Depending on the purity profile of the peptide, HPFC can be used either as the sole purification method, or as a pre&#8208;purification method prior to final HPLC purification. Furthermore, HPFC is suitable for the purification of peptides that are not fully in solution. We provide guidelines for the HPFC of synthetic peptides and small proteins, including the choice of columns, eluents, and gradients. We believe that HPFC is a valuable alternative to HPLC purification of peptides and small proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Effect of Methionine Sulfoxide on the Synthesis and Purification of Aggregation&#8208;Prone Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ox and red: A synthesis and purification method for methionine&#8208;containing hydrophobic and aggregation&#8208;prone peptides that exploits the reversibility of methionine oxidation is reported. Incorporating methionine sulfoxide rather than methionine reduces aggregation during peptide synthesis and significantly facilitates peptide purification due to the increased peptide polarity. Final reduction to methionine proceeds smoothly and quantitatively.







Abstract
A two&#8208;step synthesis for methionine&#8208;containing hydrophobic and/or aggregation&#8208;prone peptides is presented that takes advantage of the reversibility of methionine oxidation. The use of polar methionine sulfoxide as a building block in solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis improves the synthesis quality and yields the crude peptide, with significantly improved solubility compared to the reduced species. This facilitates the otherwise often laborious peptide purification by high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography. The subsequent reduction proceeds quantitatively. This approach has been optimised with the methionine&#8208;rich Tar&#8208;DNA&#8208;binding protein 43 (307&#8211;347), but is also more generally applicable, as demonstrated by the syntheses of human calcitonin and two aggregation&#8208;prone peptides from the human prion protein.

         <title>Artificial Organelles: Towards Adding or Restoring Intracellular Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoreactors meet living systems. Artificial organelles, synthetic analogues of natural organelles, are gaining interest for the correction of dysfunctional intracellular processes and the addition of novel functionalities to living systems. This review outlines the different strategies via which these mostly nanosized catalytic compartments are produced and integrated with living cells.







Abstract
Compartmentalization is one of the main characteristics that define living systems. Creating a physically separated microenvironment allows nature a better control over biological processes, as is clearly specified by the role of organelles in living cells. Inspired by this phenomenon, researchers have developed a range of different approaches to create artificial organelles: compartments with catalytic activity that add new function to living cells. In this review we will discuss three complementary lines of investigation. First, orthogonal chemistry approaches are discussed, which are based on the incorporation of catalytically active transition metal&#8208;containing nanoparticles in living cells. The second approach involves the use of premade hybrid nanoreactors, which show transient function when taken up by living cells. The third approach utilizes mostly genetic engineering methods to create bio&#8208;based structures that can be ultimately integrated with the cell's genome to make them constitutively active. The current state of the art and the scope and limitations of the field will be highlighted with selected examples from the three approaches.

         <title>Ligand Binding to Dynamically Populated G&#8208;Quadruplex DNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Returning to the fold: We reveal the molecular mechanisms of binding of a small&#8208;molecule ligand to dynamically populated G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4). Upon ligand binding, a large G4 conformational redistribution occurs. This is driven by a combination of two distinct phenomena: ligand&#8208;induced G4 folding and ligand&#8208;induced trapping of folded G4 conformations.







Abstract
Several small&#8208;molecule ligands specifically bind and stabilize G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) nucleic acid structures, which are considered to be promising therapeutic targets. G4s are polymorphic structures of varying stability, and their formation is dynamic. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of ligand binding to dynamically populated human telomere G4 DNA by using the bisquinolinium based ligand Phen&#8208;DC3 and a combination of single&#8208;molecule FRET microscopy, ensemble FRET and CD spectroscopies. Different cations are used to tune G4 polymorphism and folding dynamics. We find that ligand binding occurs to pre&#8208;folded G4 structures and that Phen&#8208;DC3 also induces G4 formation in unfolded single strands. Following ligand binding to dynamically populated G4s, the DNA undergoes pronounced conformational redistributions that do not involve direct ligand&#8208;induced G4 conformational interconversion. On the contrary, the redistribution is driven by ligand&#8208;induced G4 folding and trapping of dynamically populated short&#8208;lived conformation states. Thus, ligand&#8208;induced stabilization does not necessarily require the initial presence of stably folded G4s.

         <dc:description>
Making a difference: Inorganic enzyme mimics, mainly consisting of inorganic complexes and nanozymes, have attracted much interest and found widespread applications in healthcare, energy, and environmental fields. Because of their splendid properties, such as high stability, tailorable activity and low cost, these enzyme mimics are making and will continue to make a big difference in future science and technology.







Abstract
Enzyme mimics (or artificial enzymes) have emerged as valuable alternatives to natural enzymes since the pioneering work of Ronald Breslow. They have numerous advantages over natural enzymes, such as high stability, low cost, and tailorable activity. Among varieties of materials explored to mimic enzymes, the inorganic ones, including inorganic complexes and nanomaterials, have attracted increasing interest over the last decade and have the potential to address the current challenges in energy, environment, health, etc.

         <title>Activation, Structure, Biosynthesis and Bioactivity of Glidobactin&#8208;like Proteasome Inhibitors from Photorhabdus laumondii</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The silent treatment: Glidobactin&#8208;like proteasome inhibitors are regarded as promising candidates for anticancer drug development. We report the largest subset of glidobactin&#8208;like proteasome inhibitors, which are produced and identified after the silent biosynthetic gene cluster plu1881&#8211;1877 is activated in the native host P. laumondii.







Abstract
The glidobactin&#8208;like natural products (GLNPs) glidobactin&#8197;A and cepafungin&#8197;I have been reported to be potent proteasome inhibitors and are regarded as promising candidates for anticancer drug development. Their biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) plu1881&#8211;1877 is present in entomopathogenic Photorhabdus laumondii but silent under standard laboratory conditions. Here we show the largest subset of GLNPs, which are produced and identified after activation of the silent BGC in the native host and following heterologous expression of the BGC in Escherichia coli. Their chemical diversity results from a relaxed substrate specificity and flexible product release in the assembly line of GLNPs. Crystal structure analysis of the yeast proteasome in complex with new GLNPs suggests that the degree of unsaturation and the length of the aliphatic tail are critical for their bioactivity. The results in this study provide the basis to engineer the BGC for the generation of new GLNPs and to optimize these natural products resulting in potential drugs for cancer therapy.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis and Biological Applications of O&#8208;GlcNAcylated Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sugar modifications on proteins enable cells to respond quickly to environmental cues. We review the plethora of chemical strategies to access precise glycoforms of O&#8208;GlcNAc peptides and full proteins and explore the translational use of synthetic O&#8208;GlcNAc glycopeptides and glycoproteins as biomarkers, mechanistic probes, and therapeutics. Synthetic O&#8208;GlcNAc glycobiology is poised to rapidly identify roles in chronic and infectious disease.







Abstract
All human cells use O&#8208;GlcNAc protein modifications (O&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetylglucosamine) to rapidly adapt to changing nutrient and stress conditions through signaling, epigenetic, and proteostasis mechanisms. A key challenge for biologists in defining precise roles for specific O&#8208;GlcNAc sites is synthetic access to homogenous isoforms of O&#8208;GlcNAc proteins, a result of the non&#8208;genetically templated, transient, and heterogeneous nature of O&#8208;GlcNAc modifications. Toward a solution, this review details the state of the art of two strategies for O&#8208;GlcNAc protein modification: advances in &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; O&#8208;GlcNAc peptide synthesis and direct &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; installation of O&#8208;GlcNAc on full proteins. We also describe key applications of synthetic O&#8208;GlcNAc peptide and protein tools as therapeutics, biophysical structure&#8211;function studies, biomarkers, and as disease mechanistic probes to advance translational O&#8208;GlcNAc biology.

         <title>Recent Advances in Two&#8208;Photon AIEgens and Their Application in Biological Systems</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improving potential: Two&#8208;photon AIEgen probes have attracted a lot of attention due to their advantages of large penetration depth, little light damage, dark field imaging and target excitation. This paper reviews the most representative two&#8208;photon imaging technology of the past five years, and discusses its great application potential in the field of biological imaging.







Abstract
Two&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging technology has the advantages of high light stability, little light damage, and high spatiotemporal resolution, which make it a powerful biological analysis method. However, due to the high concentration or aggregation state of traditional organic light&#8208;emitting molecules, the fluorescence intensity is easily reduced or disappears completely, and is not conducive to optimal application. The concept of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) provides a solution to the problem of aggregation&#8208;induced luminescence quenching (ACQ), and realizes the high fluorescence quantum yield of luminescent molecules in the aggregation state. In addition, two&#8208;photon absorption properties can readily be improved just by increasing the loading content of AIE fluorogen (AIEgen). Therefore, the design and preparation of two&#8208;photon fluorescence probes based on AIEgen to achieve high&#8208;efficiency fluorescence imaging in&#8197;vitro/in&#8197;vivo has become a major research hotspot. This review aims to summarize representative two&#8208;photon AIEgens based on triphenylamine, tetraphenylethene, quinoline, naphthalene and other new structures from the past five years, and discuss their great potential in bioimaging applications.

         <title>IsPETase Is a Novel Biocatalyst for Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hitting the bottle: IsPETase is receiving increased attention for its ability to degrade crystalline PET, a major cause of plastic pollution. This review summarizes the current state of investigation into IsPETase and puts forward the necessity of utilizing and engineering IsPETase for industrial applications.







Abstract
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is one of the most widely used synthetic polyesters, but also a major cause of plastic pollution. Because the chemical degradation of PET would be uneconomical and rather burdensome, considerable efforts have been devoted to exploring enzymatic processes for the disposal of PET waste. Many PET&#8208;hydrolyzing enzymes have been reported in recent decades, some of which demonstrate excellent potential for industrial applications. This review sets out to summarize the state of investigation into IsPETase, a cutinase&#8208;like enzyme from Ideonella sakaiensis possessing ability to degrade crystalline PET, and to gain further insight into the structure&#8211;function relationship of IsPETase. Benefiting from the continuing identification of novel cutinase&#8208;like proteins and growing availability of the engineered IsPETase, we may anticipate future developments in this type of enzyme would generate suitable biocatalyst for industrial use.

         <title>Inducible CRISPR&#8208;dCas9 Transcriptional Systems for Sensing and Genome Regulation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transforming transcription: Inducible CRISPR&#8208;dCas9 transcription systems that rely on exogenous and endogenous cues to conditionally control the function of dCas9 proteins or gRNAs have provided pioneering platforms for genome engineering, cell&#8208;specific sensing and therapies.







Abstract
The clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats&#8208;associated protein 9 endonuclease (CRISPR&#8208;Cas9) and the nuclease&#8208;deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) systems have revolutionized our ability to precisely engineer and regulate genomes. Inducible CRISPR&#8208;dCas9&#8208;based transcriptional systems have been rapidly developed to conditionally control genetic manipulation. Current strategies mainly focus on conditional control of gRNA function and dCas9 protein using exogenous and endogenous triggers, including external light, small molecules, synthetic and intracellular oligonucleotides. These strategies have established novel platforms for the spatiotemporal regulation of genome activation and repression, epigenome editing, and so on. Herein, we summarize the recent progress in conditionally controlling CRISPR&#8208;dCas9 transcriptional systems through gRNA modulation and dCas9 protein engineering.

         <title>Investigation of vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 hydroxylation by Kutzneria albida</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The active vitamin D metabolites 25&#8208;OH&#8208;D and 1&#945;,25&#8208;(OH)  2  &#8208;D play an essential role in controlling several cellular processes in the human body and are potentially effective in the treatment of several diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The microbial synthesis of vitamin D  2  (VD  2  ) and vitamin D  3  (VD  3  ) metabolites has emerged as a suitable alternative to established complex chemical syntheses. In this study, a novel strain,  Kutzneria albida  , was identified, showing the ability to form 25&#8208;OH&#8208;D  2  and 25&#8208;OH&#8208;D  3  . To further improve the conversion of the poorly soluble substrates, several solubilizers were tested. 100&#8208;fold higher product concentrations of 25&#8208;OH&#8208;D  3  and 10&#8208;fold higher concentrations of 25&#8209;OH&#8208;D  2  after addition of 5% (w/v) 2&#8208;hydroxypropyl &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (2&#8208;HP&#946;CD) were reached. Besides the single hydroxylation products, the human double hydroxylation products 1,25&#8208;(OH)  2  &#8208;D  2  and 1,25&#8208;(OH)  2  &#8208;D  3  and various other potential single and double hydroxylation products were detected. Thus,  K. albida  represents a promising strain for the biotechnological production of VD  2  and VD  3  metabolites.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies for Site&#8208;Specific Labeling of Receptor Proteins on the Surfaces of Living Cells by Using Genetically Encoded Peptide Tags</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescence microscopy imaging provides information about the localization and trafficking of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases. To visualize these proteins, reporter groups must be introduced on the surface of live cells. This review discusses live&#8208;cell protein labelling by small, genetically encoded peptide tags serving as enzyme substrates or recognition sites for interactions with proteins, coiled&#8208;coil peptides and metal reagents.







Abstract
Fluorescence microscopy imaging enables receptor proteins to be investigated within their biological context. A key challenge is to site&#8208;specifically incorporate reporter moieties into proteins without interfering with biological functions or cellular networks. Small peptide tags offer the opportunity to combine inducible labeling with small tag sizes that avoid receptor perturbation. Herein, we review the current state of live&#8208;cell labeling of peptide&#8208;tagged cell&#8208;surface proteins. Considering their importance as targets in medicinal chemistry, we focus on membrane receptors such as G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). We discuss peptide tags that i) are subject to enzyme&#8208;mediated modification reactions, ii) guide the complementation of reporter proteins, iii) form coiled&#8208;coil complexes, and iv) interact with metal complexes. Given our own contributions in the field, we place emphasis on peptide&#8208;templated labeling chemistry.

         <title>Unveiling the Potential of Transition Metal Complexes for Medicine: Translational in Situ Activation of Metal&#8208;Based Drugs from Bench to in Vivo Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control and select: Novel metal&#8208;based drugs for treating diverse diseases have recently been under the spotlight. Fine control of off&#8208;targeted toxic effects was achieved by using a variety of stabilized coordination ligands along with different metal centers. Herein, we highlight the versatile, effective and valuable use of transition metals in medicine, namely for in&#8197;situ activation of metal&#8208;based drugs.







Abstract
The development of metal&#8208;based anticancer drugs has been hampered, among other reasons, by their lack of selectivity for cancer cells. In a recent article, Zou and co&#8208;workers presented the successful intracellular activation of organogold(I) complexes for potential cancer treatment through Pd(II)&#8208;mediated transmetallation, overcoming some off&#8208;target activity of novel gold&#8208;based drugs. This unique strategy builds the perfect bridge between metallodrug usage and bioorthogonal intracellular catalysis for more advanced and selective therapies. Such an approach will hopefully pave the way for forthcoming studies in medicinal inorganic chemistry.

         <title>Reversible Control of Gelatin Hydrogel Stiffness by Using DNA Crosslinkers**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going soft: We report a gelatin methacrylate hydrogel crosslinked with DNA. The stiffness of the gel can be switched by a factor of &#8764;2, over two cycles, by using displacement strands, with no degradation of gel performance. Using two DNA sequences allows orthogonal control of gel stiffness and ligand presentation.







Abstract
Biomaterials with dynamically tunable properties are critical for a range of applications in regenerative medicine and basic biology. In this work, we show the reversible control of gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel stiffness through the use of DNA crosslinkers. We replaced some of the inter&#8208;GelMA crosslinks with double&#8208;stranded DNA, allowing for their removal through toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement. The crosslinks could be restored by adding fresh dsDNA with complementary handles to those on the hydrogel. The elastic modulus (G&#8217;) of the hydrogels could be tuned between 500 and 1000&#8197;Pa, reversibly, over two cycles without degradation of performance. By functionalizing the gels with a second DNA strand, it was possible to control the crosslink density and a model ligand in an orthogonal fashion with two different displacement strands. Our results demonstrate the potential for DNA to reversibly control both stiffness and ligand presentation in a protein&#8208;based hydrogel, and will be useful for teasing apart the spatiotemporal behavior of encapsulated cells.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution DNA Dual&#8208;Rulers Reveal a New Intermediate State in Ribosomal Frameshifting</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Branch line: Precise DNA rulers were developed to investigate the mechanism of ribosomal frameshifting. Based on super&#8208;resolution force spectroscopy, they revealed nucleic acid motion with subnucleotide resolution. New intermediate states were identified, one of which differed from the conventional state by less than a single nucleotide. Our work contributes towards understanding branching among different reading frames during protein synthesis.







Abstract
Ribosomal frameshifting is an important pathway used by many viruses for protein synthesis that involves mRNA translocation of various numbers of nucleotides. Resolving the mRNA positions with subnucleotide precision will provide critical mechanistic information that is difficult to obtain with current techniques. We report a method of high&#8208;resolution DNA rulers with subnucleotide precision and the discovery of new frameshifting intermediate states on mRNA containing a GA7G motif. Two intermediate states were observed with the aid of fusidic acid, one at the &#8220;0&#8221; reading frame and the other near the &#8220;&#8722;1&#8221; reading frame, in contrast to the &#8220;&#8722;2&#8221; and &#8220;&#8722;1&#8221; frameshifting products found in the absence of the antibiotic. We termed the new near&#8208;&#8220;&#8722;1&#8221; intermediate the Post(&#8722;1*) state because it was shifted by approximately half a nucleotide compared to the normal &#8220;&#8722;1&#8221; reading frame at the 5&#8217;&#8208;end. This indicates a ribosome conformation that is different from the conventional model of three reading frames. Our work reveals uniquely precise mRNA motions and subtle conformational changes that will complement structural and fluorescence studies.

         <title>Insight into the Mechanism of Action and Peptide&#8208;Membrane Interactions of Aib&#8208;Rich Peptides: Multitechnique Experimental and Theoretical Analysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sit up or lie down: Linear dichroism, circular dichroism and Raman spectroscopy, neutron reflectivity and molecular dynamics simulations have been used to explore how mimics of peptaibol antibiotics (Aib foldamers) interact with membranes. These studies revealed all peptides partitioned well into the bilayers, with orientation dependent upon peptide length, as well as chiral interactions between peptides and the phospholipids.







Abstract
The increase in resistant bacterial strains necessitates the identification of new antimicrobial molecules. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are an attractive option because of evidence that bacteria cannot easily develop resistance to AMPs. The peptaibols, a class of naturally occurring AMPs, have shown particular promise as antimicrobial drugs, but their development has been hindered by their mechanism of action not being clearly understood. To explore how peptaibols might interact with membranes, circular dichroism, vibrational circular dichroism, linear dichroism, Raman spectroscopy, Raman optical activity, neutron reflectivity and molecular dynamics simulations have been used to study a small library of peptaibol mimics, the Aib&#8208;rich peptides. All the peptides studied quickly partitioned and oriented in membranes, and we found evidence of chiral interactions between the phospholipids and membrane&#8208;embedded peptides. The protocols presented in this paper open new ground by showing how chiro&#8208;optical spectroscopies can throw light on the mechanism of action of AMPs.

Where is thy sting? Wasp venom&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;helical peptides and analogues were tested for antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity. The analogues were less toxic to cells and could accumulate inside cancer cells. Protonectin&#8208;F kills cancer cells and bacteria whereas neuroVAL is a nontoxic cell&#8208;penetrating peptide.







Abstract
Agelaia&#8208;MPI and protonectin are antimicrobial peptides isolated from the wasp Parachartergus fraternus that show antimicrobial and neuroactive activities. Previously, two analogues of these peptides, neuroVAL and protonectin&#8208;F, were designed to reduce nonspecific toxicity and improve potency. Here, the three&#8208;dimensional structures of neuroVAL, protonectin and protonectin&#8208;F were determined by using circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy. Antibacterial, antifungal, cytotoxic and hemolytic activities were tested for the parent peptides and analogues. All peptides showed moderate antimicrobial activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, with agelaia&#8208;MPI being the most active. Protonectin and protonectin&#8208;F were found to be toxic to cancerous and noncancerous cell lines. Internalization experiments revealed that these peptides accumulate inside both cell types. By contrast, neuroVAL was nontoxic to all tested cells and was able to enter cells without accumulating. In summary, neuroVAL has potential as a nontoxic cell&#8208;penetrating peptide, while protonectin&#8208;F needs further modification to realize its potential as an antitumor peptide.

         <title>The Antimicrobial Peptide Gad&#8208;1 Clears Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms under Cystic Fibrosis Conditions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a metal&#8208;mediated mode of action, the metallo&#8208;antimicrobial peptide Gad&#8208;1 can effectively clear P. aeruginosa biofilms. In the presence of Cu2+ ions, Gad&#8208;1 rapidly cleaves the exogenous DNA that allows biofilms to thrive. Anti&#8208;biofilm activity was observed at a range of pH, ionic strength, and in the presence of exogenous DNA, conditions relevant to cystic fibrosis.







Abstract
Bacterial infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are an emerging health issue and lead to a premature death. CF is a hereditary disease that creates a thick mucus in the lungs that is prone to bacterial biofilm formation, specifically Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. These biofilms are very difficult to treat because many of them have antibiotic resistance that is worsened by the presence of extracellular DNA (eDNA). eDNA helps to stabilize biofilms and can bind antimicrobial compounds to lessen their effects. The metallo&#8208;antimicrobial peptide Gaduscidin&#8208;1 (Gad&#8208;1) eradicates established P. aeruginosa biofilms through a combination of modes of action that includes nuclease activity that can cleave eDNA in biofilms. In addition, Gad&#8208;1 exhibits synergistic activity when used with the antibiotics kanamycin and ciprofloxacin, thus making Gad&#8208;1 a new lead compound for the potential treatment of bacterial biofilms in CF patients.

         <title>Cleavage of an RNA Model Compound by an Arylmercury Complex</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soluble, but not so speedy: The potential of an water&#8208;soluble arylmercury compound to cleave RNA has been explored. The somewhat low catalytic activity compared to free HgII was attributed to the relatively low affinity of the arylmercury catalyst for the RNA model compound. This suggests that improved derivatives could be obtained by covalent tethering to an appropriate targeting group.







Abstract
A water&#8208;soluble arylmercury complex has been synthesized, and its ability to catalyze the cleavage of the phosphodiester linkage of the RNA model compound adenylyl&#8208;3&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;methyleneadenosine) has been assessed over a pH range of 3&#8211;8.5 and a catalyst concentration range of 0&#8211;7&#8197;mM. In the presence of 1&#8197;mM catalyst, the observed pH&#8211;rate profile featured a new pH&#8208;independent region between pH&#8197;6 and 7, the catalyzed reaction being as much as eight times faster than the background reaction. At pH&#8197;7, the acceleration increased linearly from three&#8208; to 17&#8208;fold upon increasing the catalyst concentration from 1 to 7&#8197;mM. The linear dependence indicates a relatively low affinity of the catalyst for the substrate and, hence, the potential for considerable improvement on tethering to an appropriate targeting group, such as an oligonucleotide.

         <title>DNA Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization Driven by Base Stacking</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An open and shut case: A new system of DNA supramolecular polymerization driven by DNA base stacking together with a sequence symmetry design strategy is demonstrated. In this system, a unique component strand first formed a dimeric ring and one opener strand opened it to initiate the polymerization.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers, relying on reversible intermolecular interactions, promise a wide range of applications, including optoelectronic materials, self&#8208;healing materials, and biomedical delivery materials. Among potential molecular candidates, DNA strands act as an excellent platform. DNA has a well&#8208;established secondary structure (double helix), and its intermolecular interactions can be readily thermodynamically engineered and kinetically controlled. Extensive studies have demonstrated that various DNA motifs can polymerize/assemble into large polymers with different topology, geometry, and dimensionalities. Most of the reported polymerization is driven by hybridization of DNA strands. Herein, we report a novel system of DNA supramolecular polymerization that is driven by DNA base stacking. The polymerization has been confirmed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). We believe that this work will expand the toolbox for DNA supramolecular polymerization and would, with further development, increase further control of DNA supramolecular polymerization.

         <title>Stable Hairpin Structures Formed by Xylose&#8208;Based Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable ladder: Thermal and spectroscopic analyses of xylose (XyNA) and deoxyxylose nucleic acids (dXyNA) indicate the formation of stable hairpin structures. The solution structure of a fully modified dXyNA hairpin indicates the structural preference for a ladder&#8208;like stem with a noncanonical loop.







Abstract
Xenobiology explores synthetic nucleic acid polymers as alternative carriers of genetic information to expand the central dogma. The xylo&#8208; and deoxyxylo&#8208;nucleic acids (XyNA and dXyNA), containing 3&#8217; epimers of riboses and deoxyriboses, are considered to be potential candidates for an orthogonal system. In this study, thermal and spectroscopic analyses show that XyNA and dXyNA form stable hairpins. The dXyNA hairpin structure determined by NMR spectroscopy contains a flexible loop that locks the stem into a stable ladder&#8208;like duplex with marginal right&#8208;handed helicity. The reduced flexibility of the dXyNA duplex observed in the stem of the hairpin demonstrates that folding of dXyNA yields more stable structures described so far.

         <title>Photoregulation of Gene Expression with Ligand&#8208;Modified Caged siRNAs through Host/Guest Interaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bigger cage, bigger effect: Photomodulation of gene expression has been successfully achieved in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo by using guest&#8208;molecule&#8208;modified caged siRNAs, which contains the corresponding bulky blocking complex at 5&#8242; terminus of the antisense RNA strand, through guest/host interactions.







Abstract
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) can effectively silence target genes through Argonate 2 (Ago2)&#8208;induced RNA interference (RNAi). It is very important to control siRNA activity in both spatial and temporal modes. Among different masking strategies, photocaging can be used to regulate gene expression through light irradiation with spatiotemporal and dose&#8208;dependent resolution. Many different caging strategies and caging groups have been reported for light&#8208;activated siRNA gene silencing. Herein, we describe a novel caging strategy that increases the blocking effect of RISC complex formation/process through host/guest (including ligand/receptor) interactions, thereby enhancing the inhibition of caged siRNA activity until light activation. This strategy can be used as a general approach to design caged siRNAs for the photomodulation of gene silencing of exogenous and endogenous genes.

     alt="Photoregulation of Gene Expression with Ligand&#8208;Modified Caged siRNAs through Host/Guest Interaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bigger cage, bigger effect&lt;/b&gt;: Photomodulation of gene expression has been successfully achieved &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt; by using guest&#8208;molecule&#8208;modified caged siRNAs, which contains the corresponding bulky blocking complex at 5&#8242; terminus of the antisense RNA strand, through guest/host interactions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small interfering RNA (siRNA) can effectively silence target genes through Argonate 2 (Ago2)&#8208;induced RNA interference (RNAi). It is very important to control siRNA activity in both spatial and temporal modes. Among different masking strategies, photocaging can be used to regulate gene expression through light irradiation with spatiotemporal and dose&#8208;dependent resolution. Many different caging strategies and caging groups have been reported for light&#8208;activated siRNA gene silencing. Herein, we describe a novel caging strategy that increases the blocking effect of RISC complex formation/process through host/guest (including ligand/receptor) interactions, thereby enhancing the inhibition of caged siRNA activity until light activation. This strategy can be used as a general approach to design caged siRNAs for the photomodulation of gene silencing of exogenous and endogenous genes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>RNA&#8208;Cleaving DNA Thresholder Controlled by Concentrations of miRNA Cancer Marker</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On a high: We have developed a deoxyribozyme&#8208;based thresholder (DTh) that distinguishes the high levels of miR markers found in cancer cells from the low levels found in healthy cells and cleaves another, vital RNA. The DTh constructs showed the expected response to different concentrations of a neuroblastoma marker, exhibiting efficient cleavage of long RNA molecules with high selectivity.







Abstract
Oligonucleotide gene therapy (OGT) agents suppress specific mRNAs in cells and thus reduce the expression of targeted genes. The ability to unambiguously distinguish cancer from healthy cells can solve the low selectivity problem of OGT agents. Cancer RNA markers are expressed in both healthy and cancer cells with a higher expression level in cancer cells. We have designed a DNA&#8208;based construct, named DNA thresholder (DTh) that cleaves targeted RNA only at high concentrations of cancer marker RNA and demonstrates low cleavage activity at low marker concentrations. The RNA&#8208;cleaving activity can be adjusted within one order of magnitude of the cancer marker RNA concentration by simply redesigning DTh. Importantly, DTh recognizes cancer marker RNA, while cleaving targeted RNA; this offers a possibility to suppress vital genes exclusively in cancer cells, thus triggering their death. DTh is a prototype of computation&#8208;inspired molecular device for controlling gene expression and cancer treatment.

         <title>Tagged Benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;Ones as Novel Activity&#8208;Based Probes for Serine Proteases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1&#8208;step synthesis, 2&#8208;step labeling: Alkyne&#8208;conjugated benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones are easily accessible in a 1&#8208;step synthesis from substituted anthranilic acid derivatives. They make novel activity&#8208;based probes that covalently react with serine proteases and allow read&#8208;out by copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition.







Abstract
Activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs) are valuable chemical tools for profiling enzymes. They have been particularly useful in the study of proteases. ABPs rely on electrophilic scaffolds that covalently modify the target enzymes. Ideally, they can be made in a fast and uncomplicated manner. Here, we explore alkyne&#8208;substituted benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones as ABPs for serine proteases, because they inhibitserine proteases covalently and their synthesis is very straightforward. We show that alkyne&#8208;tagged benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones can be used in two&#8208;step bioorthogonal tandem labeling procedures or pre&#8208;functionalized with a biotin or fluorophore. We demonstrate that these reagents can be used to label and identify various serine proteases. Therefore, we expect that tagged benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones will offer easily synthesizable tools for profiling of serine proteases.

         <title>SP3&#8208;FAIMS Chemoproteomics for High&#8208;Coverage Profiling of the Human Cysteinome**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Versatile verification: A new cysteine chemoproteomic method enables rapid and high&#8208;coverage analysis of the human cysteinome. By combining enhanced cysteine biotinylation with SP3 sample decontamination and FAIMS on&#8208;line fraction, we identified in aggregate 34225 unique cysteines found on 7243 proteins. Integration with the isoTOP&#8208;ABPP workflow enabled the high&#8208;throughput discovery of cysteines labeled by electrophilic compounds.







Abstract
Chemoproteomics has enabled the rapid and proteome&#8208;wide discovery of functional, redox&#8208;sensitive, and ligandable cysteine residues. Despite widespread adoption and considerable advances in both sample&#8208;preparation workflows and MS instrumentation, chemoproteomics experiments still typically only identify a small fraction of all cysteines encoded by the human genome. Here, we develop an optimized sample&#8208;preparation workflow that combines enhanced peptide labeling with single&#8208;pot, solid&#8208;phase&#8208;enhanced sample&#8208;preparation (SP3) to improve the recovery of biotinylated peptides, even from small sample sizes. By combining this improved workflow with on&#8208;line high&#8208;field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) separation of labeled peptides, we achieve unprecedented coverage of &gt;14000 unique cysteines in a single&#8208;shot 70&#8197;min experiment. Showcasing the wide utility of the SP3&#8208;FAIMS chemoproteomic method, we find that it is also compatible with competitive small&#8208;molecule screening by isotopic tandem orthogonal proteolysis&#8211;activity&#8208;based protein profiling (isoTOP&#8208;ABPP). In aggregate, our analysis of 18 samples from seven cell lines identified 34225 unique cysteines using only &#8764;28&#8197;h of instrument time. The comprehensive spectral library and improved coverage provided by the SP3&#8208;FAIMS chemoproteomics method will provide the technical foundation for future studies aimed at deciphering the functions and druggability of the human cysteineome.

         <title>Genetic Incorporation of Selenotyrosine Significantly Improves Enzymatic Activity of Agrobacterium radiobacter Phosphotriesterase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tyrosine plays important roles in many enzyme catalysts. To facilitate enzyme design, mechanistic studies and minimize structural perturbation in the active site, here we report the genetic incorporation of a novel unnatural amino acid selenotyrosine (SeHF), which has single atom replacement in comparison to tyrosine. The  Agrobacterium radiobacter  phosphotriesterase (  ar  PTE) Tyr309SeHF mutant exhibits a significant 12&#8208;fold increase in  k  cat  and 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in  k  cat  /  K  m  at pH 7.0.  Molecular dynamics simulation  shows that the SeHF309 mutation results in a conformational switch which opens up the product release pocket and increases the product release rate, thereby elevating the overall enzyme activity. Significant improvement of the catalytic efficiency at neutral pH by single unnatural amino acid (UAA) mutation broadens the application of this enzyme, and provides valuable insights to the mechanism. Our method represents a new approach for designing enzymes with enhanced activities.</dc:description>
