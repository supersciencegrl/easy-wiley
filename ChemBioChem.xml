         <title>Pentachloropseudilin treatment impairs host cell invasion by Trypanosoma cruzi</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pentachloropseudilin (PClP) is a reversible and allosteric inhibitor of type 1 myosin. Here, we addressed the impact of PClP treatment of  Trypanosoma cruzi  and mammalian host cell on the parasite migration, cell adhesion and invasion. We observed that PClP was not toxic to either  T. cruzi  or host cell. Moreover, treatment of  T. cruzi  with PClP inhbited parasite motility, host cell adhesion and invasion. Treatment of host cell with PClP also impaired parasite invasion probably by decreasing lysosome migration to the entry site of the parasite. Therefore, PClP treatment impaired fundamental processes necessary for a successful  T. cruzi  infection.</dc:description>

         <title>Anticancer water&#8208;soluble organoruthenium complexes: synthesis and preclinical evaluation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis, characterisation, and evaluation of the  in vitro  cytotoxicity of five maleonitriledithiolate&#8208;based ruthenium metal complexes bearing various phosphine ligands towards two ovarian cancer cell lines (A2780 and A2780cisR), one non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung cancer cell line (H460) and one normal prostate cell line (PNT2) are presented herein. These 18&#8208;electron complexes were designed with four water&#8208;soluble phosphine ligands to increase the water&#8208;solubility character of the corresponding electron&#8208;deficient ruthenium complex which showed great  in vitro  promises, and triphenylphosphine for comparison. The complexes with triphenylphosphine&#8208;3,3',3''trisulfonic acid and triphenylphosphine present similar cytotoxicity compared to the 16&#8208;electron precursor, with equal cytotoxicity to both A2780 and A2780cisR. Hints at the mechanism of action suggest an apoptotic pathway based on ROS production. No toxicity was observed in preliminary  in vivo  pilot studies for these two complexes in subcutaneous A2780 and A2780cisR xenograft models, with some evidence of tumour growth delay.</dc:description>

         <title>Cleavable linker incorporation into a synthetic dye &#8211; nanobody &#8211;fluorescent protein assembly: FRET, FLIM and STED microscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A bright and photostable fluorescent dye with a disulfide (S&#8208;S) linker and maleimide group (Rho594&#8208;S2&#8208;mal), as cleavable and reactive sites, was synthesized and conjugated with anti&#8208;GFP nanobodies (NB). The binding of EGFP (FRET donor) with anti&#8208;GFP NB labeled with one or two Rho594&#8208;S2&#8208;mal residues was studied in vitro and in cellulo. The linker was cleaved with dithiothreitol recovering the donor (FP) signal. The bioconjugates (FP&#8208;NB&#8208;dye) were applied in FRET&#8208;FLIM assays, multiplexed confocal imaging, and superresolution STED microscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioconjugation strategies for Tobacco mild green mosaic virus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tobacco mild green mosaic virus (TMGMV) is a plant virus closely related to Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). These rod&#8208;shaped viruses, comprised of 2130 identical coat protein subunits, have been utilized as nanotechnological platforms for applications such as drug delivery and&#160;precision agriculture. This versatility for functionalization is due to their chemically active external and internal surfaces. While both viruses are similar, structural data suggest that&#160;TMGMV's surface chemistry should not overlap with TMV. In this work, we refined chemical bioconjugation strategies to load molecules into or onto TMGMV. A combination of NHS, EDC, and diazo coupling reactions in combination with click chemistry were used to modify the  N  &#8208;terminus, glutamic/aspartic acid residues, and tyrosines in TMGMV. We report loading with over 600 moieties per TMGMV via diazo&#8208;coupling. We also report that cargo can be loaded to the solvent&#8208;exposed  N  &#8208;terminus and carboxylates on the exterior/interior surfaces. Mass spectrometry revealed the most reactive sites to be Y12 and Y72&#160;on the exterior surface. For the carboxylates, interior E106 (66.53%) was the most reactive , with the exterior E145 accounting for &gt;15% reactivity. A deeper understanding of the chemical properties of TMGMV further enables its functionalization and use as a multifunctional nanocarrier platform for applications in medicine and precision farming.</dc:description>

         <title>Tyramine Derivatives Catalyze the Aldol Dimerization of Butyraldehyde in the Presence of Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacterial amine organocatalysis: Biogenic amines derived from L&#8208;tyrosine were found to catalyze the biocompatible self&#8208;aldol dimerization of butanal in the presence of Escherichia coli. Cell lysates from both E. coli and Corynebacterium glutamicum were also found to catalyze this reaction in&#8197;vitro. Under biocompatible conditions, the product enal was reduced to 2&#8208;ethylhexanal via endogenous reductases.







Abstract
Biogenic amine organocatalysts have transformed the field of synthetic organic chemistry. Yet despite their use in synthesis and to label biomolecules in&#8197;vitro, amine organocatalysis in&#8197;vivo has received comparatively little attention &#8211; despite the potential of such reactions to be interfaced with living cells and to modify cellular metabolites. Herein we report that biogenic amines derived from L&#8208;tyrosine catalyze the self&#8208;aldol condensation of butanal to 2&#8208;ethylhexenal &#8211; a key intermediate in the production of the bulk chemical 2&#8208;ethylhexanol &#8211; in the presence of living Escherichia coli and outperform many amine organocatalysts currently used in synthetic organic chemistry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cell lysate from E. coli and the prolific amine overproducer Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032 catalyze this reaction in&#8197;vitro, demonstrating the potential for microbial metabolism to be used as a source of organocatalysts for biocompatible reactions in cells.

         <title>Synthetic &#945;&#8208;Helical Peptides as Potential Inhibitors of the ACE2 SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Interaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The N&#8208;cap makes the difference: Aiming at the development of potential COVID&#8208;19 drugs distorting the interaction between the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein and human ACE2, a series of N&#8208;capped peptides derived from the &#945;1&#8208;helix of ACE2 were prepared to increase the &#945;&#8208;helical content. This led to the discovery of a comparably short peptide binding to the spike protein with high affinity (KD=62&#8197;nM).







Abstract
During viral cell entry, the spike protein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 binds to the &#945;1&#8208;helix motif of human angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme&#8197;2 (ACE2). Thus, alpha&#8208;helical peptides mimicking this motif may serve as inhibitors of viral cell entry. For this purpose, we employed the rigidified diproline&#8208;derived module ProM&#8208;5 to induce &#945;&#8208;helicity in short peptide sequences inspired by the ACE2 &#945;1&#8208;helix. Starting with Ac&#8208;QAKTFLDKFNHEAEDLFYQ&#8208;NH2 as a relevant section of &#945;1, a series of peptides, N&#8208;capped with either Ac&#8208;&#946;HAsp&#8208;[ProM&#8208;5] or Ac&#8208;&#946;HAsp&#8208;PP, were prepared and their &#945;&#8208;helicities were investigated. While ProM&#8208;5 clearly showed a pronounced effect, an even increased degree of helicity (up to 63&#8201;%) was observed in sequences in which non&#8208;binding amino acids were replaced by alanine. The binding affinities of the peptides towards the spike protein, as determined by means of microscale thermophoresis (MST), revealed only a subtle influence of the &#945;&#8208;helical content and, noteworthy, led to the identification of an Ac&#8208;&#946;HAsp&#8208;PP&#8208;capped peptide displaying a very strong binding affinity (KD=62&#8197;nM).

&lt;b&gt;-cap makes the difference&lt;/b&gt;: Aiming at the development of potential COVID-19 drugs distorting the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2, a series of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-capped peptides derived from the &#945;1-helix of ACE2 were prepared to increase the &#945;-helical content. This led to the discovery of a comparably short peptide binding to the spike protein with high affinity (K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;=62&#8197;nM).

         <title>A High&#8208;Throughput Continuous Spectroscopic Assay to Measure the Activity of Natural Product Methyltransferases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small molecule methylation catalyzed by natural product methyltransferases (NPMTs) carries a tremendous potential to improve bioactivity and bioavailability of natural products. To assist with the expansion of available NPMTs, we present a high&#8208;throughput continuous assay for the rapid and reliable detection of methyltransferase activity for small molecules.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Human Cancer Proteins Using Microprocessor Materials</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microchip&#8208;based substrates and high&#8208;resolution imaging technology were used to resolve full&#8208;length p53 structures from human cancer cells for the first time.







Abstract
Mutations in tumor suppressor genes, such as Tumor Protein 53 (TP53), are heavily implicated in aggressive cancers giving rise to gain&#8208; and loss&#8208;of&#8208;function phenotypes. While individual domains of the p53 protein have been studied extensively, structural information for full&#8208;length p53 remains incomplete. Functionalized microprocessor chips (microchips) with properties amenable to electron microscopy permitted us to visualize complete p53 assemblies for the first time. The new structures revealed p53 in an inactive dimeric state independent of DNA binding. Residues located at the protein&#8208;protein interface corresponded with modification sites in cancer&#8208;related hot spots. Changes in these regions may amplify the toxic effects of clinical mutations. Taken together, these results contribute advances in technology and imaging approaches to decode native protein models in different states of activation.

         <title>A General Strategy for the Design and Evaluation of Heterobifunctional Tools: Applications to Protein Localization and Phase Separation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Just as a rocket enables the exploration of space, heterobifunctional tools allow us to probe the mysteries of biology. We have developed a powerful, microscopy&#8208;based assay to optimize the linkers of heterobifunctional tools. This is represented in the cover illustration by a rocket, powered by an optimized linker, setting out from a green, fluorescent planet (GFP) to a planet of interest (POI). We used this tool to induce phase separation, symbolized by stars in the sky. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Zhang, D.&#8197;M. Chenoweth et&#8197;al.

         <title>Trace&#8208;Level Phenolics Detection Based on Composite PAN&#8208;MWCNTs Nanofibers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrospun nanofiber mat consisting of polyacrylonitrile and multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes was employed as an immobilization matrix in tyrosinase&#8208;based biosensors. The biosensors were very successful in trace&#8208;level detection of mono&#8208; and diphenol derivatives in water samples.







Abstract
In view of major concerns regarding toxicity (genotoxic, mutagenic, hepatotoxic) of phenolics, there is an on&#8208;going necessity for sensitive and accurate analytical procedures for detection and measurements in environmental field, water, and food quality control. The current study proposes composite polyacrylonitrile nanofibrous assemblies enriched with multi&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (PAN&#8208;MWCNTs NFs) as suitable immobilization platforms for cross&#8208;linking of tyrosinase in detection of both diphenols and monophenols, which are of much interest in water contamination. The prepared biosensor (Pt/PAN&#8208;MWCNTs/Tyr) showed high sensitivity in catechol detection (362.5&#8197;mA/M.cm2) and moderate sensitivity for the two monophenols (phenol, p&#8208;chlorophenol) with 14.79 and 25.46&#8197;mA/M.cm2, respectively. The LOD values of the sensor were in the nanomolar range: 4.42&#215;10&#8722;9, 4.06&#215;10&#8722;7 and 1.05&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;M for catechol, phenol and p&#8208;chlorophenol, respectively, allowing detection of trace amounts of phenolics in spiked water samples.

C4&#8208;regioselective prenylation of 5&#8208;substituted tryptophans as well as truncated tryptophan derivatives was achieved using a set of prenlyltransferases. Conversions were increased by designing improved variants and the feasibility of preparative transformations was successfully demonstrated reaching isolated yields up to 90&#8201;%.







Abstract
Regioselective carbon&#8722;carbon bond formation belongs to the challenging tasks in organic synthesis. In this context, C&#8722;C bond formation catalyzed by 4&#8208;dimethylallyltryptophan synthases (4&#8208;DMATSs) represents a possible tool to regioselectively synthesize C4&#8208;prenylated indole derivatives without site&#8208;specific preactivation and circumventing the need of protection groups as used in chemical synthetic approaches. In this study, a toolbox of 4&#8208;DMATSs to produce a set of 4&#8208;dimethylallyl tryptophan and indole derivatives was identified. Using three wild&#8208;type enzymes as well as variants, various C5&#8208;substituted tryptophan derivatives as well as N&#8208;methyl tryptophan were successfully prenylated with conversions up to 90&#8201;%. Even truncated tryptophan derivatives like tryptamine and 3&#8208;indole propanoic acid were regioselectively prenylated in position C4. The acceptance of C5&#8208;substituted tryptophan derivatives was improved up to 5&#8208;fold by generating variants (e.&#8201;g. T108S). The feasibility of semi&#8208;preparative prenylation of selected tryptophan derivatives was successfully demonstrated on 100&#8197;mg scale at 15&#8197;mM substrate concentration, allowing to reduce the previously published multistep chemical synthetic sequence to just a single step.

         <title>BioWF: A Naturally&#8208;Fused, Di&#8208;Domain Biocatalyst from Biotin Biosynthesis Displays an Unexpectedly Broad Substrate Scope</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A BioWF fusion biocatalyst can convert various fatty acid substrates to &#945;&#8208;oxoamine (AON) products. The ATP&#8208;dependent BioW domain catalyses formation of an acyl&#8208;CoA thioester intermediate. The pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP)&#8208;dependent BioF domain then accepts various amino acids and catalyses the formation of a range of aminoketone analogues.







Abstract
The carbon backbone of biotin is constructed from the C7 di&#8208;acid pimelate, which is converted to an acyl&#8208;CoA thioester by an ATP&#8208;dependent, pimeloyl&#8208;CoA synthetase (PCAS, encoded by BioW). The acyl&#8208;thioester is condensed with &#671;&#8208;alanine in a decarboxylative, Claisen&#8208;like reaction to form an aminoketone (8&#8208;amino&#8208;7&#8208;oxononanoic acid, AON). This step is catalysed by the pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP)&#8208;dependent enzyme (AON synthase, AONS, encoded by BioF). Distinct versions of Bacillus subtilis BioW (BsBioW) and E. coli BioF (EcBioF) display strict substrate specificity. In contrast, a BioW&#8208;BioF fusion from Corynebacterium amycolatum (CaBioWF) accepts a wider range of mono&#8208; and di&#8208;fatty acids. Analysis of the active site of the BsBioW : pimeloyl&#8208;adenylate complex suggested a key role for a Phe (F192) residue in the CaBioW domain; a F192Y mutant restored the substrate specificity to pimelate. This surprising substrate flexibility also extends to the CaBioF domain, which accepts &#671;&#8208;alanine, &#671;&#8208;serine and glycine. Structural models of the CaBioWF fusion provide insight into how both domains interact with each other and suggest the presence of an intra&#8208;domain tunnel. The CaBioWF fusion catalyses conversion of various fatty acids and amino acids to a range of AON derivatives. Such unexpected, natural broad substrate scope suggests that the CaBioWF fusion is a versatile biocatalyst that can be used to prepare a number of aminoketone analogues.

         <title>Multivalent &#947;&#8208;PGA&#8208;Exendin&#8208;4 Conjugates to Target Pancreatic &#946;&#8208;Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
Exendin&#8208;4&#8208;&#947;&#8208;polyglutamic acid conjugates have been generated by efficient Diels&#8208;Alder click reaction. The highly functionalized conjugate (average 106 Exendin&#8208;4 molecules/&#947;&#8208;Polyglutamic acid) showed affinity towards GLP1 receptor higher with respect to Enendin&#8208;4 a labile peptide approved for type 2 diabetes treatment.







Abstract
Targeting of glucagon&#8208;like peptide 1 receptor (GLP&#8208;1R), expressed on the surface of pancreatic &#946;&#8208;cells, is of great interest for the development of advanced therapies for diabetes and diagnostics for insulinoma. We report the conjugation of exendin&#8208;4 (Ex&#8208;4), an approved drug to treat type 2 diabetes, to poly&#8208;&#947;&#8208;glutamic acid (&#947;&#8208;PGA) to obtain more stable and effective GLP&#8208;1R ligands. Exendin&#8208;4 modified at Lysine&#8208;27 with PEG4&#8208;maleimide was conjugated to &#947;&#8208;PGA functionalized with furan, in different molar ratios, exploiting a chemoselective Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition. The &#947;&#8208;PGA presenting the highest number of conjugated Ex&#8208;4 molecules (average 120 per polymeric chain) showed a double affinity towards GLP&#8208;1R with respect to exendin per se, paving the way to improved therapeutic and diagnostic applications.

         <title>Endogenous Proteins Modulation in Live Cells with Small Molecules and Light</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The protein modulation by light illumination enables the biological role investigation in high spatiotemporal precision. Compared to genetic methods, the small molecules approach is uniquely suited for modulating endogenous proteins. The endogenous protein modulation in live cells with small molecules and light has recently advanced on three distinctive frontiers: i) the infrared&#8208;light&#8208;induced or localized decaging of small molecules by photolysis, ii) the visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photocatalytic releasing of small molecules, and iii) the small&#8208;molecule&#8208;ligand&#8208;directed caging for photo&#8208;modulation of proteins. Together, these methods provide powerful chemical biology tool kits for spatiotemporal modulation of endogenous proteins with potential therapeutic applications. This Concept aims to inspire organic chemists and chemical biologists to delve into this burgeoning endogenous protein modulation field for new biological discoveries.</dc:description>

         <title>Membrane Disruptive Action of Cationic Antibacterial Peptide B1CTcu3</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
B1CTcu3, an &#945;&#8208;helical peptide identified from the skin secretion of Clinotarsus curtipes exhibited a broad range of antibacterial activity against both Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. It also exhibits anti&#8208;biofilm properties against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. B1CTcu3 induces pores on the bacterial membrane which leads to the killing of bacteria.







Abstract
A twenty&#8208;two&#8208;residue peptide Brevinin1 Clinotarsus curtipus&#8208;3 (B1CTcu3), identified from the skin secretion of frog Clinotarsus curtipes of the Western Ghats, exhibited a broad range of antibacterial activity against Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, including the methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It showed anti&#8208;biofilm activity even at sub&#8208;minimum inhibitory concentration (sub&#8208;MIC) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Analysis of the scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images, confocal images, flow cytometric data and the effect of salt concentration on antibacterial potency suggests that the killing action of the peptide is through the membranolytic process. Single channel electric recording confirmed that the peptide elicited pores on the bacterial cell membrane as it induces a heterogeneous channel in the lipid bilayer. It also showed cytotoxicity against MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 breast cancer cell with IC50 of 25&#8197;&#956;M. B1CTcu3 peptide could serve as the template for next&#8208;generation antibacterial agents, particularly against antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria.

         <title>Determination of Amide cis/trans Isomers in N&#8208;Acetyl&#8208;d&#8208;glucosamine: Tailored NMR Analysis of the N&#8208;Acetyl Group Conformation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The N&#8208;acetyl group of N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;d&#8208;glucosamine (GlcNAc) is defined by two torsion angles, &#952;1 and &#952;2, where &#952;2 defines the amide bond orientation which enables cis&#8208;trans isomerization (CTI). This is the first identification of NH protons of the amide cis isomers of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc, which has allowed conformational analysis of these isomers based on J&#8208;couplings within the N&#8208;acetyl group.







Abstract
N&#8208;Acetyl&#8208;d&#8208;glucosamine (GlcNAc) is one of the most common amino sugars in nature, but the conformation of its N&#8208;acetyl group has drawn little attention. We report herein the first identification of NH protons of the amide cis forms of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc by NMR spectroscopy. Relative quantification and thermodynamic analysis of both cis and trans forms was carried out in aqueous solution. The NH protons were further utilized by adapting protein NMR experiments to measure eight J&#8208;couplings within the N&#8208;acetyl group, of which six are sensitive to the H2&#8208;NH conformation and two are sensitive to the amide conformation. For amide cis and trans forms, the orientation between H2 and NH was determined as anti conformation, while a small percentage of syn conformation was predicted for the amide trans form of &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc. This approach holds great promise for the detailed conformational analysis of GlcNAc in larger biomolecules, such as glycoproteins and polysaccharides.

         <title>Lectin Drug Conjugates Targeting High Mannose N&#8208;Glycans</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer&#8208;associated alterations to glycosylation have been shown to aid cancer development and progression. An increased abundance of high mannose N&#8208;glycans has been observed in several cancers. Here, we describe the preparation of lectin drug conjugates (LDCs) that permit toxin delivery to cancer cells presenting high mannose N&#8208;glycans. Additionally, we demonstrate that cancer cells presenting low levels of high mannose N&#8208;glycans can be rendered sensitive to the LDCs by co&#8208;treatment with a type I mannosidase inhibitor. Our findings establish that an increased abundance of high mannose N&#8208;glycans in the glycocalyx of cancer cells can be leveraged to enable toxin delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Peroxidase Activity of Myoglobin Variants Reconstituted with Artificial Cofactors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Myoglobin (Mb) can react with hydrogen peroxide (H  2  O  2  ) to form a highly active intermediate compound and catalyse oxidation reactions. To enhance this activity, known as pseudo peroxidase activity, previous studies have focused on the modification of key residues or the Mb heme cofactor. In this work, the Mb scaffold (apo&#8208;Mb) was systematically reconstituted with a set of cofactors based on six metal ions and two ligands. These Mb variants were fully characterised by UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma mass (ICP&#8208;MS) and native mass (nMS) spectrometry. The steady&#8208;state kinetics of guaiacol oxidation and 2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenol (TCP) dehalogenation catalysed by Mb variants were determined. Mb variants with iron chlorin e6 (Fe&#8208;Ce6) and manganese chlorin e6 (Mn&#8208;Ce6) cofactors were found to have improved catalytic efficiency for both guaiacol and TCP substrates in comparison with wild&#8208;type Mb, i.e. Fe&#8208;protoporphyrin IX&#8208;Mb (FePPIX&#8208;Mb). Furthermore, the selected cofactors were incorporated into the scaffold of a Mb mutant, swMb H64D. Enhanced peroxidase activity for both substrates were found via the reconstitution of the Fe&#8208;Ce6 into the mutant scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron Oxide Nanoparticles Functionalized with Fucoidan: a Potential Theranostic Nanotool for Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;small super&#8208;paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (USPIO NPs) were functionalized with fucoidan, a natural sulfated polysaccharide mimicking glycosaminoglycans, to obtain a potential theranostic nanotool for hepatocellular carcinoma. The USPIO NPs act as vehicle and magnetic label to control fucoidan loading within cells.







Abstract
Fucoidan is a natural sulfated polysaccharide with a large range of biological activities including anticancer and anti&#8208;oxidation activities. Hepatocellular carcinoma is the fourth most common aggressive cancer type. The aim of this study was to investigate the bioactivity of free fucoidan versus its vectorization using nanoparticles (NPs) in human hepatoma cells, Huh&#8208;7. Iron oxide NPs were functionalized with fucoidan by a one&#8208;step surface complexation. NP cellular uptake was quantified by magnetic measurement at various extracellular iron concentrations. Cell invasion and migration were reduced with NPs while free fucoidan increases these events at low fucoidan concentration (&#8804;0.5&#8197;&#956;M). Concomitantly, a high decrease of reactive oxygen species production related with a decrease of the matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;9 activity and an increase of its expression was observed with NPs compared to free fucoidan. A proteomic analysis evidenced that some fucoidan regulated proteins appeared, which were related to protein synthesis, N&#8208;glycan processing, and cellular stress. To our knowledge, this is the first study which reveals such activity induced by fucoidan. These results pave the way for USPIO&#8208;fucoidan&#8208;NPs as potential theranostic nanotools for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment.

         <title>Regulating Spatial Localization and Reactivity Biasness of DNAzymes by Metal Ions and Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique macroscopic spatially controlled, non&#8208;equilibrium sensing and catalytic behavior for the G&#8208;quadruplex based DNAzyme towards substrate and inhibitor concentration gradient along with its modulation in an environment with non&#8208;catalytic aptamer is reported. This unique reaction&#8208;diffusion based organizational and catalytic heterogeneity of DNAzyme in space will show new insights in the area of spatially controlled surface chemistry, bio&#8208;patterning and DNA nanotechnology.







Abstract
Chemical gradient sensing behavior of catalytically active colloids and enzymes is an area of immense interest owing to their importance in understanding fundamental spatiotemporal complexity patterns in living systems and designing dynamic materials. Herein, we have shown the peroxidase activity of DNAzyme (G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;hemin complex tagged in a micron&#8208;sized glass bead) can be modulated by metal ions and metal ion&#8208;binding oligonucleotides. Next we demonstrated both experimentally and theoretically, that the localization and product formation ability of the DNAzyme&#8208;containing particle remains biased to the more catalytically active zone where the concentration of metal ion (Hg2+) inhibitor is low. Interestingly, this biased localization can be broken by introduction of Hg2+ binding oligonucleotide in the system. Additionally, a macroscopically asymmetric catalytic product distributed zone has been achieved with this process, showing the possibility of regulation in autonomous spatially controlled chemical processes. This demonstration of autonomous modulation of the localization pattern and spatially specific enhanced product forming ability of DNAzymes will further enable the design of responsive nucleic acid&#8208;based motile materials and surfaces.

         <title>New far&#8208;red and near&#8208;infrared fluorescent phycobiliproteins with excellent brightness and photostability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Far&#8208;red and near&#8208;infrared fluorescent proteins can be used as fluorescence biomarkers in the region of maximal transmission of most tissues and facilitate multiplexing. Recently, we reported the generation and properties of far&#8208;red and near&#8208;infrared fluorescent phycobiliproteins, termed BeiDou Fluorescent Proteins (BDFPs), which can covalently bind the more readily accessible biliverdin. Far&#8208;red BDFPs maximally fluoresce at ~670 nm, while near&#8208;infrared BDFPs fluoresce at ~710 nm. In this work, we molecularly evolved BDFPs as follows: (a) mutations L58Q, S68R and M81K of BDFPs, which can maximally enhance the effective brightness in vivo by 350%; (b) minimization and monomerization of far&#8208;red BDFPs 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and near&#8208;infrared BDFPs 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6. These newly developed BDFPs are remarkably brighter than the formerly reported far&#8208;red and near&#8208;infrared fluorescent proteins. Their advantages are demonstrated by biolabeling in mammalian cells using super&#8208;resolution microscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Applications and Limitations of Oxime&#8208;Linked &#8220;Split PROTACs&#8221;</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteolysis targeting chimeras are of keen interest as probe molecules and drug leads. Their activity is highly sensitive to the length and nature of the linker connecting the E3 Ubiquitin Ligase (E3 Ubl) and target protein (TP) ligands, which therefore requires tedious optimization. The creation of &#8220;split PROTACs&#8221; from E3 Ubl and TP ligands modified with residues suitable for them to couple when simply mixed together would allow various combinations to be assessed in a combinatorial fashion, thus greatly easing the workload relative to a one&#8208;by&#8208;one synthesis of many different PROTACs. We explore oxime chemistry here for this purpose. We demonstrate that this process is indeed an efficient method to create PROTACs conveniently. However, we also show that the method has several limitations when one attempts to form the PROTACs in situ in the presence of cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular covalent bonds in Gram&#8208;positive bacterial surface proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gram&#8208;positive bacteria experience considerable mechanical perturbation when adhering to host surfaces during colonization and infection. They have evolved various adhesion proteins that are mechanically robust to ensure strong surface adhesion. Recently, it was discovered that these adhesion proteins contain rare, extra intramolecular covalent bonds that stabilize protein structures and participate in surface bonding. These intramolecular covalent bonds include isopeptides, thioesters, and ester bonds, which often form spontaneously without the need for additional enzymes. With the development of single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy techniques, the detailed mechanical roles of these intramolecular covalent bonds have been revealed. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in this area of research, focusing on the link between the mechanical stability and function of these covalent bonds in Gram&#8208;positive bacterial surface proteins. We also highlight the potential impact of these discoveries on the development of novel antibiotics and chemical biology tools.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembly of Two&#8208;Dimensional DNA Arrays Could Influence the Formation of Their Component Tiles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tile&#8208;based DNA self&#8208;assembly is a powerful approach for nano&#8208;constructions. In this approach, individual DNA single strands first assemble into well&#8208;defined structural tiles, which, then, further associate with each other into final nanostructures. It is a general assumption that the lower&#8208;level structures (tiles) determines the higher&#8208;level, final structures. In this study, we present concrete experimental data to show that higher&#8208;level structures could, at least in the current example, also impact on the formation of lower&#8208;level structures. This study prompts questions such as: how general does this phenomenon exist in programmed DNA self&#8208;assembly and can we turn it into a useful tool for fine tuning DNA self&#8208;assembly?</dc:description>

         <title>Generation of Photocaged Nanobodies for Intracellular Applications in an Animal Using Genetic Code Expansion and Computationally Guided Protein Engineering
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;activated nanobodies for intracellular use were created using a combination of genetic code expansion and computationally guided engineering of the binding interface. The engineered nanobodies allow optical control of subcellular protein localisation in living Caenorhabditis elegans.







Abstract
Nanobodies are becoming increasingly popular as tools for manipulating and visualising proteins in&#8197;vivo. The ability to control nanobody/antigen interactions using light could provide precise spatiotemporal control over protein function. We develop a general approach to engineer photo&#8208;activatable nanobodies using photocaged amino acids that are introduced into the target binding interface by genetic code expansion. Guided by computational alanine scanning and molecular dynamics simulations, we tune nanobody/target binding affinity to eliminate binding before uncaging. Upon photo&#8208;activation using 365&#8197;nm light, binding is restored. We use this approach to generate improved photocaged variants of two anti&#8208;GFP nanobodies that function robustly when directly expressed in a complex intracellular environment together with their antigen. We apply them to control subcellular protein localisation in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. Our approach applies predictions derived from computational modelling directly in a living animal and demonstrates the importance of accounting for in&#8197;vivo effects on protein&#8208;protein interactions.

         <title>The total synthesis of glycolipids from S. pneumoniae and a re&#8208;evaluation of their immunological activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT) are responsible for the production of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines which induce a systemic immune response. They are distinctive in possessing an invariant T&#8208;cell receptor that recognizes glycolipid antigens presented by the class I major histocompatibility complex&#8208;related protein CD1d, conserved across multiple mammalian species in a class of proteins well&#8208;renowned for their high degree of polymorphism. This receptor&#8217;s first identified antigen is the potent &#945;&#8208;galactose ceramide, KRN7000 , a glycosphingolipid isolated from bacteria that were found on a Japanese marine sponge. The corresponding terrestrial antigen remained unidentified until quite recently, when diacylglycerol&#8208;containing glycolipids, reported to activate iNKT cells, were isolated from Streptococcus pneumoniae . We report the total synthesis and immunological re&#8208;evaluation of these two glycolipids. The compounds are unable to meaningfully activate iNKT cells. Computational modelling shows that these ligands, while being capable of interacting with the CD1d receptor, create a different surface for the binary complex that makes formation of the ternary complex with the iNKT T&#8208;cell receptor difficult. Together these results suggest that the reported activity might have been due to an impurity in the original isolated sample and highlights the importance of taking care when reporting biological activity from isolated natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Tying Up a Loose End: On the Role of the C&#8208;Terminal CCHHRAG Fragment of the Metalloregulator CueR</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C&#8208;terminal &#8220;tail&#8221; of CueR does not influence the overall structure of the protein and the structure of the functional metal site but significantly affects the binding affinity for monovalent metal ions, despite being disordered and relatively remote, i.&#8201;e. beyond the second coordination sphere of AgI coordinated at the functional metal binding loop.







Abstract
The transcriptional regulator CueR is activated by the binding of CuI, AgI, or AuI to two cysteinates in a near&#8208;linear fashion. The C&#8208;terminal CCHHRAG sequence in Escherichia coli CueR present potential additional metal binding ligands and here we explore the effect of deleting this fragment on the binding of AgI to CueR. CD spectroscopic and ESI&#8208;MS data indicate that the high AgI&#8208;binding affinity of WT&#8208;CueR is significantly reduced in &#916;7C&#8208;CueR.[111 Ag PAC spectroscopy demonstrates that the WT&#8208;CueR metal site structure (AgS2) is conserved, but less populated in the truncated variant. Thus, the function of the C&#8208;terminal fragment may be to stabilize the two&#8208;coordinate metal site for cognate monovalent metal ions. In a broader perspective this is an example of residues beyond the second coordination sphere affecting metal site physicochemical properties while leaving the structure unperturbed.

         <title>Recombinant l&#8208;Amino Acid Oxidase with Broad Substrate Spectrum for Co&#8208;substrate Recycling in (S)&#8208;Selective Transaminase&#8208;Catalyzed Kinetic Resolutions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient co&#8208;substrate recycling system consisting of a heterologous expressed and highly active l&#8208;amino acid oxidase combined with a catalase was applied for kinetic resolutions to produce enantiopure (R)&#8208;amines in &#969;&#8208;(S)&#8208;transaminase catalyzed reactions. Consequently, catalytic instead of stoichiometric amounts of co&#8208;substrate can be applied in preparative scale reactions.







Abstract
Chiral and enantiopure amines can be produced by enantioselective transaminases via kinetic resolution of amine racemates. This transamination reaction requires stoichiometric amounts of co&#8208;substrate. A dual&#8208;enzyme recycling system overcomes this limitation: l&#8208;amino acid oxidases (LAAO) recycle the accumulating co&#8208;product of (S)&#8208;selective transaminases in the kinetic resolution of racemic amines to produce pure (R)&#8208;amines. However, availability of suitable LAAOs is limited. Here we use the heterologously produced, highly active fungal hcLAAO4 with broad substrate spectrum. H2O2 as byproduct of hcLAAO4 is detoxified by a catalase. The final system allows using sub&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of 1&#8197;mol% of the transaminase co&#8208;substrate as well as the initial application of l&#8208;amino acids instead of &#945;&#8208;keto acids. With an optimized protocol, the synthetic potential of this kinetic resolution cascade was proven at the preparative scale (&gt;90&#8197;mg) by the synthesis of highly enantiomerically pure (R)&#8208;methylbenzylamine (&gt;99&#8201;%ee) at complete conversion (50&#8201;%).

         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small molecule targeting of DNA and RNA sequences has come into focus as a therapeutic strategy for diseases such as myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), a trinucleotide repeat disease characterized by RNA gain&#8208;of&#8208;function. Herein, we report a novel template&#8208;selected, reversible assembly of therapeutic agents in situ via aldehyde&#8208;amine condensation. Rationally designed small molecule targeting agents functionalized with either an aldehyde or an amine were synthesized and screened against the target nucleic acid sequence. The assembly of fragments was confirmed by MALDI&#8208;MS in the presence of DM1&#8208;relevant nucleic acid sequences. The resulting hit combinations of aldehyde and amine inhibited the formation of r(CUG)  exp  &#160;in vitro in a cooperative manner at low micromolar levels and rescued mis&#8208;splicing defects in DM1 model cells. This reversible template&#8208;selected assembly is a promising approach to achieve cell permeable and multivalent targeting via in situ synthesis and could be applied to other nucleic acid targets.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of C7&#8208;Sugars for Molecular Evidence of in&#8197;vivo Shikimate Pathway Inhibition</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 13, July 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
7&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;sedoheptulose is a cyanobacterial antimetabolite of the 3&#8208;dehydroquinate synthase, second enzyme of the shikimate pathway. Design of a hybrid synthesis of chemical and chemoenzymatic steps using heterologously expressed transketolase efficiently yielded the heptulose family. In vivo and in&#8197;vitro studies on Anabaena variabilis and Arabidopsis thaliana gave a profound understanding of the mode of action.







Abstract
The design of distinctive chemical synthesis strategies aims for the most efficient routes towards versatile compounds in drug target studies. Here, we establish a powerful hybrid synthetic approach of total chemical and chemoenzymatic synthesis to efficiently obtain various 7&#8208;deoxy&#8208;sedoheptulose (7dSh, 1) analogues, unique C7 sugars, for structure&#8208;activity relationship studies. 7dSh (1) is a rare microbial sugar with in planta herbicidal activity. As natural antimetabolite of 3&#8208;dehydroquinate synthase (DHQS), 7dSh (1) inhibits the shikimate pathway, which is essential for the synthesis of aromatic amino acids in bacteria, fungi, and plants, but absent in mammals. As glyphosate, the most used chemical herbicide faces restrictions worldwide, DHQS has gained more attention as valid target of herbicides and antimicrobial agents. In vitro and in&#8197;vivo analyses of the C7&#8208;deoxysugars confirm DHQS as enzymatic target, highlight the crucial role of uptake for inhibition and add molecular aspects to target mechanism studies of C7&#8208;sugars as our contribution to global efforts for alternative weed&#8208;control strategies.

Design of a hybrid synthesis of chemical and chemoenzymatic steps using heterologously expressed transketolase efficiently yielded the heptulose family. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies on &lt;i&gt;Anabaena variabilis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; gave a profound understanding of the mode of action.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design of distinctive chemical synthesis strategies aims for the most efficient routes towards versatile compounds in drug target studies. Here, we establish a powerful hybrid synthetic approach of total chemical and chemoenzymatic synthesis to efficiently obtain various 7-deoxy-sedoheptulose (7dSh, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) analogues, unique C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; sugars, for structure-activity relationship studies. 7dSh (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) is a rare microbial sugar with &lt;i&gt;in planta&lt;/i&gt; herbicidal activity. As natural antimetabolite of 3-dehydroquinate synthase (DHQS), 7dSh (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) inhibits the shikimate pathway, which is essential for the synthesis of aromatic amino acids in bacteria, fungi, and plants, but absent in mammals. As glyphosate, the most used chemical herbicide faces restrictions worldwide, DHQS has gained more attention as valid target of herbicides and antimicrobial agents. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt; analyses of the C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;-deoxysugars confirm DHQS as enzymatic target, highlight the crucial role of uptake for inhibition and add molecular aspects to target mechanism studies of C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;-sugars as our contribution to global efforts for alternative weed-control strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Assessment of Bioactivity&#8208;Modulating Pseudo&#8208;Ring Formation in Psilocin and Related Tryptamines</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 13, July 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Psychedelic pharmacology: Psilocin is a powerful psychoactive tryptamine and candidate medication against therapy&#8208;resistant depression. We demonstrate a pseudo&#8208;ring structure in psilocin via an intramolecular hydrogen bond that masks this molecule's polar groups. This feature is a key prerequisite of psilocin's ability to cross the blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier and cause intensely colored visuals and other perceptual and psychedelic effects.







Abstract
Psilocybin (1) is the major alkaloid found in psychedelic mushrooms and acts as a prodrug to psilocin (2, 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethyltryptamine), a potent psychedelic that exerts remarkable alteration of human consciousness. In contrast, the positional isomer bufotenin (7, 5&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethyltryptamine) differs significantly in its reported pharmacology. A series of experiments was designed to explore chemical differences between 2 and 7 and specifically to test the hypothesis that the C&#8208;4 hydroxy group of 2 significantly influences the observed physical and chemical properties through pseudo&#8208;ring formation via an intramolecular hydrogen bond (IMHB). NMR spectroscopy, accompanied by quantum chemical calculations, was employed to compare hydrogen bond behavior in 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;hydroxylated tryptamines. The results provide evidence for a pseudo&#8208;ring in 2 and that sidechain/hydroxyl interactions in 4&#8208;hydroxytryptamines influence their oxidation kinetics. We conclude that the propensity to form IMHBs leads to a higher number of uncharged species that easily cross the blood&#8208;brain barrier, compared to 7 and other 5&#8208;hydroxytryptamines, which cannot form IMHBs. Our work helps understand a fundamental aspect of the pharmacology of 2 and should support efforts to introduce it (via the prodrug 1) as an urgently needed therapeutic against major depressive disorder.

         <title>Recombinant Snail Sialic Acid Aldolase is Promiscuous towards Aliphatic Aldehydes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 13, July 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aldolases reversibly catalyze the cleavage of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. A recombinant snail sialic acid aldolase (sNPL) differs significantly in its carbohydrate substrate promiscuity from other sialic aldolases described so far. In addition, sNPL was able to synthesize a series of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxoates using the corresponding aliphatic aldehyde substrates.







Abstract
Aldolases are enzymes that reversibly catalyze the cleavage of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. Here we describe a recombinant sialic acid aldolase originating from the freshwater snail Biomphalaria glabrata (sNPL), and compare its substrate spectrum with a sialic acid aldolase originating from chicken (chNPL). In contrast to vertebrate animals which can synthesize, degrade, and incorporate sialic acids on glycoconjugate ubiquitously, snails (as all mollusks) cannot synthesize sialic acids endogenously, and therefore the biological function and substrate scope of sNPL ought to differ significantly from vertebrate sialic aldolases such as chNPL. sNPL was active towards a series of sialic acid derivatives but was in contrast to chNPL unable to catalyze the cleavage of N&#8208;acetylneuraminic acid into N&#8208;acetylmannosamine and pyruvate. Interestingly, chNPL and sNPL showed contrasting C4(R)/(S) diastereoselectivity towards the substrates d&#8208;mannose and d&#8208;galactose in the presence of pyruvate. In addition, sNPL was able to synthesize a series of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxoates using the corresponding aliphatic aldehyde substrates in the presence of pyruvate, which could be not achieved by chNPL.

         <title>C&#8208;Nitrosothioformamide: A Donor Template for Dual Release of HNO and H2S</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 13, July 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction triggered dual release of H2S and HNO from C&#8208;nitrosothioformamides is reported. This process produces HNO and COS concurrently. COS can be further converted to H2S by carbonic anhydrase. These donors may be useful to understanding the crosstalk between H2S and HNO.







Abstract
C&#8208;Nitrosothioformamide was demonstrated to be a donor template for dual release of HNO and COS triggered by a retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. COS is an H2S precursor in the presence of carbonic anhydrase. This process produces HNO and H2S in a slow but steady manner. As such, the direct reaction between HNO and H2S under this situation appears to be minor. This may provide a useful tool for studying the synergistic effects of HNO and H2S.

         <title>Synthetic Supramolecular Host for D&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;Ribose: Ratiometric Fluorescence Response via Multivalent Lectin&#8208;Carbohydrate Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 13, July 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoresponsive as well as pH&#8208;sensitive fluorescent nanoaggregates, composed of carbazole&#8208;based amphiphiles, showed changes in fluorescence signal from greenish yellow to cyan, specifically in the presence of D&#8208;ribose. The mechanistic studies indicate dissociation of the preformed molecular assembly in the presence of ribose, probably due to multipoint hydrogen bonding as well as CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions involving the acyl hydrazone units and pyridyl residues.







Abstract
Easily synthesizable, carbazole&#8208;based organic nanoaggregates have been designed for selective detection of D&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;ribose at physiological pH. The addition of D&#8208;ribose results in a ratiometric change in fluorescence color from green to cyan (LOD: &#8764;12&#8197;&#956;M). The mechanistic studies indicate the presence of multipoint noncovalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding and CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between D&#8208;ribose and acyl hydrazone and terminal pyridyl units of the probe molecule. However, such multipoint interactions dissociate the preformed self&#8208;assembled nanoclusters and induce change in optical response. The probe molecule was further exploited in analyzing D&#8208;ribose content in biological fluids (diluted human urine and blood serum) and oral supplements. The small standard deviation values (2&#8211;3.8&#8201;%) with nearly quantitative recovery (93.5&#8211;105.5&#8201;%) indicate the high accuracy of the presented method. Further, low&#8208;cost portable device based coated paper strips were designed for &#8216;on&#8208;location&#8217; rapid, detection of D&#8208;ribose even at remote locations.

         <title>N4&#8208;Allyldeoxycytidine: A New DNA Tag with Chemical Sequencing Power for Pinpointing Labelling Sites, Mapping Epigenetic Markers, and In Situ Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 13, July 5, 2022. </description>

N4&#8208;allyldeoxycytidine (a4dC) can be encoded into DNA as regular deoxycytidine and decoded as mutant bases upon chemical sequencing. We explored the applications of the a4dC tag the in identification of DNA labelling sites, mapping epigenetic DNA marker N4&#8208;methyldeoxycytidine, and fixing and imaging of DNA in&#8197;situ.







Abstract
DNA tagging with base analogues has found numerous applications. To precisely record the DNA labelling information, it would be highly beneficial to develop chemical sequencing tags that can be encoded into DNA as regular bases and decoded as mutant bases following a mild, efficient and bioorthogonal chemical treatment. Here we reported such a DNA tag, N4&#8208;allyldeoxycytidine (a4dC), for labeling and identifying DNA by in&#8197;vitro assays. The iodination of a4dC led to fast and complete formation of 3, N4&#8208;cyclized deoxycytidine, which induced base misincorporation during DNA replication and thus could be located at single base resolution. We explored the applications of a4dC in pinpointing DNA labelling sites at single base resolution, mapping epigenetic marker N4&#8208;methyldeoxycytidine, and imaging nucleic acids in&#8197;situ. In addition, mammalian cellular DNA could be metabolically labelled with a4dC. Our study sheds light on the design of next generation DNA tags with chemical sequencing power.

         <title>Recovery of Hydroxytyrosol from Olive Mill Wastewater Using the Promiscuous Hydrolase/Acyltransferase PestE</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 13, July 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Use it all: Olive mill wastewater contains the majority of health&#8208;promoting olive phenols, but this resource has been little utilized. For the valorization of olive mill wastewater, the promiscuous acyltransferase PestE was engineered to acetylate hydroxytyrosol notably in an aqueous phase and to facilitate its extraction into the organic ethyl acetate phase.







Abstract
Olive mill wastewater (OMWW) is produced annually during olive oil extraction and contains most of the health&#8208;promoting 3&#8208;hydroxytyrosol of the olive fruit. To facilitate its recovery, enzymatic transesterification of hydroxytyrosol (HT) was directly performed in an aqueous system in the presence of ethyl acetate, yielding a 3&#8208;hydroxytyrosol acetate rich extract. For this, the promiscuous acyltransferase from Pyrobaculum calidifontis VA1 (PestE) was engineered by rational design. The best mutant for the acetylation of hydroxytyrosol (PestE_I208A_L209F_N288A) was immobilized on EziG2 beads, resulting in hydroxytyrosol conversions between 82 and 89&#8201;% in one hour, for at least ten reaction cycles in a buffered hydroxytyrosol solution. Due to inhibition by other phenols in OMWW the conversions of hydroxytyrosol from this source were between 51 and 62&#8201;%. In a preparative scale reaction, 13.8&#8197;mg (57&#8201;%) of 3&#8208;hydroxytyrosol acetate was extracted from 60&#8197;mL OMWW.

         <title>Synthesis of 6,6&#8208; and 7,7&#8208;Difluoro&#8208;1&#8208;acetamidopyrrolizidines and Their Oxidation Catalyzed by the Nonheme Fe Oxygenase LolO</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 13, July 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two difluorinated analogues of 1&#8208;exo&#8208;acetamidopyrrolizidine (AcAP), an intermediate in loline alkaloid biosynthesis, were prepared and subjected to LolO, the enzyme that naturally hydroxylates and cycloetherifies AcAP. LolO (2&#8208;oxoglutarate&#8208;dependent nonheme Fe oxygenase) hydroxylates and cycloetherifies 6,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;AcAP, but it only hydroxylates 7,7&#8208;difluoro&#8208;AcAP. The resulting 7,7&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;AcAP may be useful for studying the LolO&#8208;catalyzed cycloetherification of 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;AcAP.







Abstract
LolO, a 2&#8208;oxoglutarate&#8208;dependent nonheme Fe oxygenase, catalyzes both the hydroxylation of 1&#8208;exo&#8208;acetamidopyrrolizidine (AcAP), a pathway intermediate in the biosynthesis of the loline alkaloids, and the cycloetherification of the resulting alcohol. We have prepared fluorinated AcAP analogues to aid in continued mechanistic investigation of the remarkable LolO&#8208;catalyzed cycloetherification step. LolO was able to hydroxylate 6,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;AcAP (prepared from N,O&#8208;protected 4&#8208;oxoproline) and then cycloetherify the resulting alcohol, forming a difluorinated analogue of N&#8208;acetylnorloline and providing evidence for a cycloetherification mechanism involving a C(7) radical as opposed to a C(7) carbocation. By contrast, LolO was able to hydroxylate 7,7&#8208;difluoro&#8208;AcAP (prepared from 3&#8208;oxoproline) but failed to cycloetherify it, forming (1R,2R,8S)&#8208;7,7&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;AcAP as the sole product. The divergent LolO&#8208;catalyzed reactions of the difluorinated AcAP analogues provide insight into the LolO cycloetherification mechanism and indicate that the 7,7&#8208;difluorinated compound, in particular, may be a useful tool to accumulate and characterize the iron intermediate that initiates the cycloetherification reaction.

         <title>M379A Mutant Tyrosine Phenol&#8208;lyase from Citrobacter freundii Has Altered Conformational Dynamics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 13, July 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The M379A mutant tyrosine phenol&#8208;lyase is a good catalyst for synthesis of L&#8208;tyrosine analogues. The crystal structure and kinetic studies show that the mutation affects conformational changes coupled with the catalytic reaction.







Abstract
The M379A mutant of Citrobacter freundii tyrosine phenol&#8208;lyase (TPL) has been prepared. M379A TPL is a robust catalyst to prepare a number of tyrosines substituted at the 3&#8208;position with bulky groups that cannot be made with wild type TPL. The three dimensional structures of M379A TPL complexed with L&#8208;methionine and 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;DL&#8208;phenylalanine have been determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Methionine is bound as a quinonoid complex in a closed active site in 3 of 4 chains of homotetrameric M379A TPL. M379A TPL reacts with L&#8208;methionine about 8&#8208;fold slower than wild type TPL. The temperature dependence shows that the slower reaction is due to less positive activation entropy. The structure of the M379A TPL complex of 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;DL&#8208;phenylalanine has a quinonoid complex in two subunits, with an open active site conformation. The effects of the M379A mutation on TPL suggest that the mutant enzyme has altered the conformational dynamics of the active site.

         <title>Second Coordination Sphere Effects on the Mechanistic Pathways for Dioxygen Activation by a Ferritin: Involvement of a Tyr Radical and the Identification of a Cation Binding Site</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 13, July 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional calculations on ferritin implicate novel features in the catalytic cycle for H2O2 synthesis from dioxygen on a diiron center including a cation&#8208;binding site held by Glu62 and Asp65. The reaction is stepwise with the involvement of an active site Tyr residue that delivers a hydrogen atom through proton&#8208;coupled&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer.







Abstract
Ferritins are ubiquitous diiron enzymes involved in iron(II) detoxification and oxidative stress responses and can act as metabolic iron stores. The overall reaction mechanisms of ferritin enzymes are still unclear, particularly concerning the role of the conserved, near catalytic center Tyr residue. Thus, we carried out a computational study of a ferritin using a large cluster model of well over 300 atoms including its first&#8208; and second&#8208;coordination sphere. The calculations reveal important insight into the structure and reactivity of ferritins. Specifically, the active site Tyr residue delivers a proton and electron in the catalytic cycle prior to iron(II) oxidation. In addition, the calculations highlight a likely cation binding site at Asp65, which through long&#8208;range electrostatic interactions, influences the electronic configuration and charge distributions of the metal center. The results are consistent with experimental observations but reveal novel detail of early mechanistic steps that lead to an unusual mixed&#8208;valent iron(III)&#8208;iron(II) center.

         <title>Synthetic Activity of Recombinant Whole Cell Biocatalysts Containing 2&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate Aldolase from Pectobacterium atrosepticum</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 13, July 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using whole cells of E. coli BL21 (PaDERA C&#8208;His AA C49M) as biocatalyst, a 99% yield of both 2&#8208;deoxyribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate and 2,4,6&#8208;trideoxy&#8208;D&#8208;erythro&#8208;hexapyranose was obtained. Furthermore, this enzyme is capable of tolerating up to 500 mM acetaldehyde in a whole&#8208;cell experiment, making it suitable for industrial applications.







Abstract
In nature 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate aldolase (DERA) catalyses the reversible formation of 2&#8208;deoxyribose 5&#8208;phosphate from D&#8208;glyceraldehyde 3&#8208;phosphate and acetaldehyde. In addition, this enzyme can use acetaldehyde as the sole substrate, resulting in a tandem aldol reaction, yielding 2,4,6&#8208;trideoxy&#8208;D&#8208;erythro&#8208;hexapyranose, which spontaneously cyclizes. This reaction is very useful for the synthesis of the side chain of statin&#8208;type drugs used to decrease cholesterol levels in blood. One of the main challenges in the use of DERA in industrial processes, where high substrate loads are needed to achieve the desired productivity, is its inactivation by high acetaldehyde concentration. In this work, the utility of different variants of Pectobacterium atrosepticum DERA (PaDERA) as whole cell biocatalysts to synthesize 2&#8208;deoxyribose 5&#8208;phosphate and 2,4,6&#8208;trideoxy&#8208;D&#8208;erythro&#8208;hexapyranose was analysed. Under optimized conditions, E.&#8201;coli BL21 (PaDERA C&#8208;His AA C49M) whole cells yields 99&#8201;% of both products. Furthermore, this enzyme is able to tolerate 500&#8197;mM acetaldehyde in a whole&#8208;cell experiment which makes it suitable for industrial applications.

         <title>Photoaffinity Labeling&#8208;Based Chemoproteomic Strategy Reveals RBBP4 as a Cellular Target of Protopanaxadiol against Colorectal Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 13, July 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
HCT116 cells were treated with the cell permeable probe AD&#8208;PPD, and irradiated with UV in&#8197;situ. Labelled proteomes were further conjugated to biotin&#8208;PEG3&#8208;azide via click chemistry, and the target of protopanaxadiol (PPD) was identified as RBBP4 by LC&#8208;MS/MS analysis.







Abstract
Protopanaxadiol (PPD), a main ginseng metabolite, exerts powerful anticancer effects against multiple types of cancer; however, its cellular targets remain elusive. Here, we synthesized a cell&#8208;permeable PPD probe via introducing a bifunctional alkyne&#8208;containing diazirine photo&#8208;crosslinker and performed a photoaffinity labeling&#8208;based chemoproteomic study. We identified retinoblastoma binding protein 4 (RBBP4), a chromatin remodeling factor, as an essential cellular target of PPD in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. PPD significantly decreased RBBP4&#8208;dependent trimethylation at lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3), a crucial epigenetic marker that correlates with histologic signs of colorectal cancer aggressiveness, and PPD inhibition of proliferation and migration of HCT116 cells was antagonized by RBBP4 RNA silencing. Collectively, our study highlights a previously undisclosed anti&#8208;colorectal cancer cellular target of the ginseng metabolite and advances the fundamental understanding of RBBP4 functions via a chemical biology strategy.

         <title>Why Omicron Variant of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is Less Fatal?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 13, July 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proteins of the Omicron variant possess numerous mutations. Multiple lysine residues newly found in these proteins build up chloride via ionic bonds, which solubilizes stressful, insoluble, and stiff calcium salts such as calcium oxalate that can trigger cell senescence.







Abstract
The article published by Nie et&#8197;al. addressed one of the two key questions regarding the Omicron variant of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, while the underpinning for the less deadly nature of the variant remains unexplained. The proteins of the Omicron variant have numerous mutations, notably several substitutions of other amino acids by lysine residues. Glycine and valine attract calcium and enhance the formation of stressful, insoluble, and stiff calcium oxalate. Lysine residues in proteins build up chloride via ionic bonds which solubilizes insoluble and rigid divalent salts. The aforementioned mutations have weakened the lethalness of the Omicron variant perhaps via a biochemical mechanism. Despite net gain in favorable mutations versus deleterious mutations, the overall valine plus glycine content is still high in the proteins of Omicron variant of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, which remains a public health concern.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 13, July 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This cover image is composed of a Tai Chi symbol containing the two significant small molecules H2S and HNO, which are simultaneously produced by the donor molecule contained in the center. H2S and HNO operate within a complex scheme of interdependencies that are not fully understood. Exploration of these interactions termed &#8216;crosstalk&#8217; are one application of this work. H2S and HNO are small gaseous molecules which are highly mobile, so they are shown speeding away from the donor. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Xian et&#8197;al.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This cover image&lt;/b&gt; is composed of a Tai Chi symbol containing the two significant small molecules H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and HNO, which are simultaneously produced by the donor molecule contained in the center. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and HNO operate within a complex scheme of interdependencies that are not fully understood. Exploration of these interactions termed &#8216;crosstalk&#8217; are one application of this work. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and HNO are small gaseous molecules which are highly mobile, so they are shown speeding away from the donor.

Instead of employing synthetically challenging macrocyclic supramolecular receptors, we have employed &#8216;dynamic molecular assemblies&#8217; as the host material for pentose sugar, d&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;ribose. Such supramolecular assemblies at proper dimensions can form a &#8216;suitable cleft&#8217; for specific sugar molecules, which further experience multi&#8208;point hydrogen bonding and CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions from the neighboring ligand molecules. The choice of a proper monomer unit and adjusting the shape and size of the nanoaggregates are crucial to improving selectivity and sensitivity towards guest molecules.

         <title>Chemical and Biological Tools for the Study of Voltage&#8208;Gated Sodium Channels in Electrogenesis and Nociception</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 13, July 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A desire to understand the role of voltage&#8208;gated sodium channels in electrical signaling and pain perception has motivated the development of chemical and biological tools that target this protein class. Such advances are summarized in this account and future research opportunities are highlighted.







Abstract
The malfunction and misregulation of voltage&#8208;gated sodium channels (NaVs) underlie in large part the electrical hyperexcitability characteristic of chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain. NaVs are responsible for the initiation and propagation of electrical impulses (action potentials) in cells. Tissue and nerve injury alter the expression and localization of multiple NaV isoforms, including NaV1.1, 1.3, and 1.6&#8211;1.9, resulting in aberrant action potential firing patterns. To better understand the role of NaV regulation, localization, and trafficking in electrogenesis and pain pathogenesis, a number of chemical and biological reagents for interrogating NaV function have been advanced. The development and application of such tools for understanding NaV physiology are the focus of this review.

Organocatalysts meet proteins: Enzymatic activities by natural organocatalytic cofactors, non&#8208;natural derivatives of them and artificial cofactors are reviewed.







Abstract
Catalytically active non&#8208;metal cofactors in enzymes carry out a variety of different reactions. The efforts to develop derivatives of naturally occurring cofactors such as flavins or pyridoxal phosphate and the advances to design new, non&#8208;natural cofactors are reviewed here. We report the status quo for enzymes harboring organocatalysts as derivatives of natural cofactors or as artificial ones and their application in the asymmetric synthesis of various compounds.

         <title>What is the Sugar Code?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 13, July 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Information coding by sugars: Letting symbols convey information comes in many forms such as the QR code. We explain that sugars are an ideal alphabet of life. They form an unsurpassed size of bio&#8208;vocabulary. It is read and translated by a matching diversity of sugar receptors (lectins) so that establishing a dictionary for the glyco&#8208;vocabulary is now in progress. The given QR code directs you to our review on the sugar code.







Abstract
A code is defined by the nature of the symbols, which are used to generate information&#8208;storing combinations (e.&#8201;g. oligo&#8208; and polymers). Like nucleic acids and proteins, oligo&#8208; and polysaccharides are ubiquitous, and they are a biochemical platform for establishing molecular messages. Of note, the letters of the sugar code system (third alphabet of life) excel in coding capacity by making an unsurpassed versatility for isomer (code word) formation possible by variability in anomery and linkage position of the glycosidic bond, ring size and branching. The enzymatic machinery for glycan biosynthesis (writers) realizes this enormous potential for building a large vocabulary. It includes possibilities for dynamic editing/erasing as known from nucleic acids and proteins. Matching the glycome diversity, a large panel of sugar receptors (lectins) has developed based on more than a dozen folds. Lectins &#8216;read&#8217; the glycan&#8208;encoded information. Hydrogen/coordination bonding and ionic pairing together with stacking and C&#8722;H/&#960;&#8208;interactions as well as modes of spatial glycan presentation underlie the selectivity and specificity of glycan&#8208;lectin recognition. Modular design of lectins together with glycan display and the nature of the cognate glycoconjugate account for the large number of post&#8208;binding events. They give an entry to the glycan vocabulary its functional, often context&#8208;dependent meaning(s), hereby building the dictionary of the sugar code.

         <title>Identification of Genes Essential for Sulfamate and Fluorine Incorporation During Nucleocidin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleocidin is a rare example of naturally occurring nucleoside containing fluorine and sulfamate substituents. Identification of Streptomyces strains that are better producers of nucleocidin has facilitated the trek towards elucidating the biosynthesis of this novel molecule. For the first time gene inactivation experiments have identified three genes, nucGIJ, encoding two predicted sulfatases and a radical SAM enzyme, that are essential for sulfamate biosynthesis. This opens the door to further functional analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster encoding nucleocidin. More information can be found in the Research Article by D.&#8197;L. Zechel et&#8197;al.

         <title>Tailored Phenyl Esters Inhibit ClpXP and Attenuate Staphylococcus aureus &#945;&#8208;Hemolysin Secretion</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inhibitory activity and stability of phenyl esters for chemical inhibition of the ClpXP&#8208;complex were systemically tailored. The new generation inhibitors show enhanced hydrolytic stability, while retaining inhibitory potency. Furthermore, this inhibition evidently reduces secretion of a major virulence factor (&#945;&#8208;hemolsyin) in Staphylococcus aureus while the inhibitors did not exhibit pronounced cytotoxicity against human and bacterial cells.







Abstract
Novel strategies against multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria are urgently needed in order to overcome the current silent pandemic. Manipulation of toxin production in pathogenic species serves as a promising approach to attenuate virulence and prevent infections. In many bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus or Listeria monocyotgenes, serine protease ClpXP is a key contributor to virulence and thus represents a prime target for antimicrobial drug discovery. The limited stability of previous electrophilic warheads has prevented a sustained effect of virulence attenuation in bacterial culture. Here, we systematically tailor the stability and inhibitory potency of phenyl ester ClpXP inhibitors by steric shielding of the ester bond and fine&#8208;tuning the phenol leaving group. Out of 17 derivatives, two (MAS&#8208;19 and MAS&#8208;30) inhibited S. aureus ClpP peptidase and ClpXP protease activities by &gt;60&#8201;% at 1&#8197;&#956;M. Furthermore, the novel inhibitors did not exhibit pronounced cytotoxicity against human and bacterial cells. Unlike the first generation phenylester AV170, these molecules attenuated S. aureus virulence markedly and displayed increased stability in aqueous buffer compared to the previous benchmark AV170.

         <title>STAT Protein Thermal Shift Assays to Monitor Protein&#8208;Inhibitor Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
STAT proteins are a family of multifaceted transcription factors whose deregulated activity is linked to diseases like cancer and arthritis. To interrogate a selection of STAT inhibitors, we have developed a protein thermal shift assay which serves as a steppingstone between biochemical thermal stability assays and cellular thermal shift assays.







Abstract
STAT3 protein is a sought&#8208;after drug target as it plays a key role in the progression of cancer. Many STAT3 inhibitors (STAT3i) have been reported, but accumulating evidence suggests many of these act as off&#8208;target/indirect inhibitors of STAT signaling. Herein, we describe the STAT protein thermal shift assay (PTSA) as a novel target engagement tool, which we used to test the binding of known STAT3i to STAT3 and STAT1. This revealed STATTIC, BP&#8208;1&#8208;102, and Cpd188 destabilized both STATs and produced unique migratory patterns on SDS&#8208;PAGE gels, suggesting covalent protein modifications. Mass spectrometry experiments confirmed that these compounds are nonspecifically alkylating STATs, as well as an unrelated protein, NUDT5. These experiments have highlighted the benefits of PTSA to investigate interactions with STAT proteins and have helped reveal the novel reactivity of Cpd188. The described PTSA represents a promising chemical biology tool that could be applied to an array of other protein targets.

         <title>Foldable Detergents for Membrane Protein Stability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As exemplified with TZM&#8208;E9, a foldable detergent with an apparently large inter&#8208;alkyl chain distance is able to form stable micelles with high alkyl chain density in the interiors. Detergent foldability is favorably associated with membrane&#8208;protein stability and represents a new concept that can be utilized for novel detergent development for membrane protein structural study.







Abstract
Detergents are widely used for membrane protein structural study. Many recently developed detergents contain multiple tail and head groups, which are typically connected via a small and branched linker. Due to their inherent compact structures, with small inter&#8208;alkyl chain distances, these detergents form micelles with high alkyl chain density in the interiors, a feature favorably associated with membrane&#8208;protein stability. A recent study on tandem triazine maltosides (TZMs) revealed a distinct trend; despite possession of an apparently large inter&#8208;alkyl chain distance, the TZM&#8722;Es were highly effective at stabilizing membrane proteins. Thanks to the incorporation of a flexible spacer between the two triazine rings in the linker region, these detergents are prone to folding into a compact architecture in micellar environments instead of adopting an extended conformation. Detergent foldability represents a new concept of novel detergent design with significant potential for future detergent development.

         <title>Methyltransferases: Functions and Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methyltransferases are enzymes that will in the future enable clean and green alkylation of amino and hydroxy groups as well as reactive carbon atoms. These enzymes, their cofactor SAM (S&#8208;adenosylmethionine) and the opportunities&#8217; they offer for new SN2 chemistries are highlighted.







Abstract
In this review the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM)&#8208;dependent methyltransferases and SAM are evaluated. Their structural classification and diversity is introduced and key mechanistic aspects presented which are then detailed further. Then, catalytic SAM as a target for drugs, and approaches to utilise SAM as a cofactor in synthesis are introduced with different supply and regeneration approaches evaluated. The use of SAM analogues are also described. Finally O&#8208;, N&#8208;, C&#8208; and S&#8208;MTs, their synthetic applications and potential for compound diversification is given.

         <title>Feruloyl esterases protein engineering to enhance their performance as biocatalysts: a review</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Feruloyl esterases (FAEs) are versatile enzymes able to release hydroxycinnamic acids or synthesize their ester derivatives, both, molecules with interesting biological activities such as: antioxidant, antifungal, antiviral, antifibrotic, anti&#8208;inflammatory, among others. The importance of these molecules in medicine, food or cosmetic industries provides FAEs with several biotechnological applications as key industrial biocatalysts. However, FAEs have first some operational limitations to overcome, which can be addressed through different protein engineering approaches to enhance their thermal stability, catalytic efficiencies, and selectivity. This review aims to present a brief historical tour through the mutagenesis strategies employed to improve enzymes performance and deeply analyze the current protein engineering strategies applied to FAEs as interesting biocatalysts. Finally, an outlook of the future of FAEs protein engineering approaches to achieve successful industrial biocatalysts is given.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Conjugation to Less Targeted Proteinogenic Amino Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein bioconjugates are in high demand for applications in biomedicine, diagnostics, chemical biology and bionanotechnology. Proteins are large and sensitive molecules containing multiple different functional groups and in particular nucleophilic groups. In bioconjugation reactions it can therefore be challenging to obtain a homogeneous product in high yield. Numerous strategies for protein conjugation have been developed, of which a vast majority targets lysine, cysteine and to a lesser extend tyrosine. Likewise, several methods that involve recombinantly engineered protein tags have been reported. In recent years a number of methods have emerged for chemical bioconjugation to other amino acids and in this review, we present the progress in this area.</dc:description>

Likewise, several methods that involve recombinantly engineered protein tags have been reported. In recent years a number of methods have emerged for chemical bioconjugation to other amino acids and in this review, we present the progress in this area.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Water&#8208;in&#8208;Water Droplets Selectively Uptake Self&#8208;Assembled DNA Nano/Microstructures: a Versatile Method for Purification in DNA Nanotechnology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dextran&#8208;rich droplets display a selective uptake of DNA structures based on size and shape. This property is explored for creating a versatile protocol for the purification of DNA structures used in DNA nanotechnology. The protocol is applicable to a wide size range of DNA structures, with a high yield and short preparation time.







Abstract
DNA is an excellent material for constructing self&#8208;assembled nano/microstructures. Owing to the widespread use of DNA as a building block in laboratories and industry, it is desirable to increase the efficiency of all steps involved in producing self&#8208;assembled DNA structures. One of the bottlenecks is the purification required to separate the excess components from the target structures. This paper describes a purification method based on the fractionation by water&#8208;in&#8208;water (W/W) droplets composed of phase&#8208;separated dextran&#8208;rich droplets in a polyethylene glycol (PEG)&#8208;rich continuous phase. The dextran&#8208;rich droplets facilitate the selective uptake of self&#8208;assembled DNA nano/microstructures and allow the separation of the target structure. This study investigates the ability to purify DNA origami, DNA hydrogels, and DNA microtubes. The W/W&#8208;droplet fractionation allows the purification of structures of a broad size spectrum without changes to the protocol. By quantifying the activity of deoxyribozyme&#8208;modified DNA origami after W/W&#8208;droplet purification, this study demonstrates that this method sufficiently preserves the accessibility to the surface of a functional DNA nanostructure. It is considered that the W/W&#8208;droplet fractionation could become one of the standard methods for the purification of self&#8208;assembled DNA nano/microstructures for biomedical and nanotechnology applications owing to its low cost and simplicity.

         <title>Influence of Reaction Conditions on Enzymatic Enantiopreference: the Curious Case of HEwT in the Synthesis of THF&#8208;Amine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While scaling&#8208;up the transamination of THF&#8208;ketone, an unusual switch in enantioselectivity was observed which correlated with increasing concentrations of amine donor. At high concentration of organic molecules, the enzyme was (S)&#8208;selective, while at high ionic strength the enzyme became (R)&#8208;selective. The mechanism for this effect is not yet clear.







Abstract
Enzymatic enantiopreference is one of the key advantages of biocatalysis. While exploring the synthesis of small cyclic (chiral amines) such as 3&#8208;aminotetrahydrofuran (THF&#8208;amine), using the (S)&#8208;selective transaminase from Halomonas elongata (HEwT), inversion of the enantiopreference was observed at increasing substrate loadings. In addition, the enantiopreference could be altered by variation of the ionic strength, or of the co&#8208;solvent content in the reaction mixture. For example, using otherwise identical reaction conditions, the presence of 2&#8197;M sodium chloride gave (R)&#8208;THF&#8208;amine (14&#8201;% ee), while the addition of 2.2&#8197;M isopropyl alcohol gave the (S)&#8208;enantiomer in 30&#8201;% ee. While the underlying cause is not currently understood, it appears likely that subtle changes in the structure of the enzyme cause the shift in enantiopreference and are worth exploring further.

         <title>Investigating peptide&#8208;Coenzyme A&#8208;conjugates as chemical probes for proteomic profiling of N&#8208;terminal and lysine acetyltransferases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acetyl groups are transferred from Acetyl&#8208;Coenzyme A (Ac&#8208;CoA) to protein N&#8208;termini and lysine side chains by N&#8208;terminal acetyltransferases (NATs) and lysine acetyltransferases (KATs), respectively. Building on lysine&#8208;CoA conjugates as KAT probes, we have synthesized peptide probes with CoA conjugated to N&#8208;terminal alanine (&#945;&#8208;Ala&#8208;CoA), proline (&#945;&#8208;Pro&#8208;CoA) or tri&#8208;glutamic acid (&#945;&#8208;3Glu&#8208;CoA) units for interactome profiling of NAT complexes. The &#945;&#8208;Ala&#8208;CoA probe enriched the majority of NAT catalytic and auxiliary subunits, while a lysine CoA&#8208;conjugate bound only a subset of endogenous KATs. Interactome profiling with the &#945;&#8208;Pro&#8208;CoA probe showed reduced NAT recruitment in favor of metabolic CoA binding proteins and &#945;&#8208;3Glu&#8208;CoA steered the interactome towards NAA80 and NatB. These findings agreed with the inherent substrate specificities of the target proteins and showed that N&#8208;terminal CoA&#8208;conjugated peptides are versatile probes for NAT complex profiling in lysates of physiological and pathological backgrounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Honeybee iflaviruses pack specific tRNA fragments from host cells in their virions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The  Picornavirales  include viruses that infect vertebrates, insects, and plants. It was believed that they pack only their genomic mRNA in the particles; thus, we envisaged these viruses as excellent model systems for studies of mRNA modifications. We used LC&#8208;MS to analyse digested RNA isolated from particles of the sacbrood and deformed wing iflaviruses as well as of the echovirus 18 and rhinovirus 2 picornaviruses. Whereas in the picornavirus RNAs we detected only N  6  &#8208;methyladenosine and 2&#8217;&#8208;  O  &#8208;methylated nucleosides, the iflavirus RNAs contained a wide range of methylated nucleosides, such as 1&#8208;methyladenosine (m  1  A) and 5&#8208;methylcytidine (m  5  C). Mapping of m  1  A and m  5  C through RNA sequencing of the SBV and DWV RNAs revealed the presence of tRNA molecules. Both modifications were detected only in tRNA. Further analysis revealed that tRNAs are present in form of 3&#8217; and 5&#8217; fragments and they are packed selectively. Moreover, these tRNAs are typically packed by other viruses.</dc:description>

         <title>Fragment screening yields  a small&#8208;molecule stabilizer of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 dimers that modulates client protein interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract  : The development of protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) inhibitors has been a successful strategy in drug development. However, the identification of PPI stabilizers has proven much more challenging. Here we report a fragment&#8208;based drug screening approach using the regulatory hub&#8208;protein 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 as a platform for identifying PPI stabilizers. A homogenous time&#8208;resolved FRET assay was used to monitor stabilization of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/peptide binding using the known interaction partner estrogen receptor alpha. Screening of an in&#8208;house fragment library identified fragment  2  (VUF15640) as a putative PPI stabilizer capable of cooperatively stabilizing 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 PPIs in a cooperative fashion with Fusicoccin&#8208;A. Mechanistically, fragment  2  appears to enhance 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 dimerization leading to increased client&#8208;protein binding. Functionally, fragment  2  enhanced potency of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 in a cell&#8208;free system inhibiting the enzyme activity of the nitrate reductase. In conclusion, we identified a general PPI stabilizer targeting 14&#8208;3&#8208;3, which could be used as a tool compound for investigating 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 client protein interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Colorimetric High&#8208;Throughput Screening Method for Directed Evolution of Prazole Sulfide Monooxygenase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A colorimetric high&#8208;throughput screening method for the rapid screening of desired variants with improved activity, thermostability, and/or substrate specificity was developed based on distinguishing sulfoxides from sulfides and sulfones. Using this method, a CbBVMO variant was identified with improved activity and thermostability, and a 71.3&#8201;% increase in catalyzing the asymmetric oxidation of lansoprazole sulfide.







Abstract
Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) are important biocatalysts for the enzymatic synthesis of chiral sulfoxides, including chiral sulfoxide&#8208;type proton pump inhibitors for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. However, native BVMOs are not yet suitable for practical application due to their unsatisfactory activity and thermostability. Although protein engineering approaches can help address these issues, few feasible high&#8208;throughput methods are available for the engineering of such enzymes. Herein, a colorimetric detection method to distinguish sulfoxides from sulfides and sulfones was developed for prazole sulfide monooxygenases. Directed evolution enabled by this method has identified a prazole sulfide monooxygenase CbBVMO variant with improved activity and thermostability that catalyzes the asymmetric oxidation of lansoprazole sulfide. A 71.3&#8201;% increase in conversion and 6&#8201;&#176;C enhancement in the melting point were achieved compared with the wild&#8208;type enzyme. This new method is feasible for high&#8208;throughput screening of prazole sulfide monooxygenase variants with improved activity, thermostability, and/or substrate specificity.

         <title>Annonaceous Acetogenin Mimic AA005 Inhibits the Growth of TNBC MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;468 Cells by Altering Cell Energy Metabolism</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Annonaceous acetogenins mimic AA005, disrupts both oxidative respiration and aerobic glycolysis in the triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cell line MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;468, thus driving the cell energy crisis and exhibiting antitumor activity in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a serious health issue for women worldwide and there is still no suitable treatment option. AA005, a structurally simplified mimic of natural Annonaceous acetogenins, presents outstanding properties with impressive cytotoxicity and cell&#8208;type selective actions. The present study was aimed at evaluating the potential of AA005 as a therapeutic agent for TNBC. AA005 potently inhibited the growth of TNBC cells at 50&#8197;nM level. Inspired by the finding of the phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) tumor suppressor, the effect of AA005 on aerobic glycolysis was investigated in TNBC MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;468 cells. A short&#8208;term AA005 exposure markedly suppressed mitochondrial function in MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;468 cells, thus activating the aerobic glycolysis to lessen the risk of decreased ATP generation in mitochondria. Prolonging the incubation time of AA005 clearly weakened the aerobic glycolysis in the cells. This was in part attributed to the PI3K&#8208;AKT pathway inactivation and subsequent declined glucose uptake. As a consequence, the energy supply was completely cut from the two major energy&#8208;producing pathways. Further experiments showed that AA005 resulted in irreversible damage on cell activity including cell cycle and growth, inducing mitochondrial oxidative stress and ultimately leading to cell death. In addition, the in&#8197;vivo therapeutic efficacy of AA005 was proved on 4T1 xenograft tumor mice model. Our data demonstrate that AA005 exhibited a great potential for future clinical applications in TNBC therapy.

         <title>Boosted Productivity in Single&#8208;Tile&#8208;Based DNA Polyhedra Assembly by Simple Cation Replacement</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple yet efficient strategy for avoiding the concentration&#8208;dependent kinetic trap in DNA self&#8208;assembly is proposed. Through substituting monovalent Na+ for conventional divalent Mg2+, we have successfully achieved one&#8208;pot high&#8208;yield assembly of tile&#8208;based DNA polyhedra at micromolar concentration of tiles, at least 10 times higher than the concentration reported previously.







Abstract
Cations such as divalent magnesium ion (Mg2+) play an essential role in DNA self&#8208;assembly. However, the strong electrostatic shielding effect of Mg2+ would be disadvantageous in some situations that require relatively weak interactions to allow a highly reversible error&#8208;correcting mechanism in the process of assembly. Herein, by substituting the conventional divalent Mg2+ with monovalent sodium ion (Na+), we have achieved one&#8208;pot high&#8208;yield assembly of tile&#8208;based DNA polyhedra at micromolar concentration of tiles, at least 10 times higher than the DNA concentrations reported previously. This strategy takes advantage of coexisting counterions and is expected to surmount the major obstacle to potential applications of such DNA nanostructures: large&#8208;scale production.

         <title>Evaluation of Gene Expression Knock&#8208;Down by Chemically and Structurally Modified Gapmer Antisense Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of modified nucleotides and short hairpins within gapmer antisense oligonucleotides on RNase H mediated gene silencing was evaluated. Our studies show that the majority of the modifications of the control gapmer increased the silencing potential of the antisense oligonucleotide. The results might facilitate the sensible design and development of potent, highly efficient RNA therapeutics.







Abstract
We analyzed the effect of modified nucleotides within gapmer antisense oligonucleotides on RNase H mediated gene silencing. Additionally, short hairpins were introduced into antisense oligonucleotides as structural motifs, and their influence on biological and physicochemical properties of pre&#8208;structured gapmers was investigated for the first time. The results indicate that two LNA residues in specified positions of the gap flanking regions are sufficient and favorable for efficient knock&#8208;down of the &#946;&#8208;actin gene. Furthermore, the introduction of other modified nucleotides, i.&#8201;e. glycyl&#8208;amino&#8208;LNA&#8722;T, 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;propagyluridine, polyamine functionalized uridine, and UNA, in specified positions, also increases the inhibition of &#946;&#8208;actin expression. Importantly, the presence of hairpins within the gapmers improves their silencing properties.

         <title>Histidine Ligated Iron&#8208;Sulfur Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;sulfur peptides typically rely on Cys for ligation. Here, we show that peptides containing both Cys and His are able to stably coordinate [2Fe&#8208;2S] clusters with properties similar to the iron&#8208;sulfur cluster of Rieske proteins.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;sulfur clusters are thought to be ancient cofactors that could have played a role in early protometabolic systems. Thus far, redox active, prebiotically plausible iron&#8208;sulfur clusters have always contained cysteine ligands to the cluster. However, extant iron&#8208;sulfur proteins can be found to exploit other modes of binding, including ligation by histidine residues, as seen with [2Fe&#8208;2S] Rieske and MitoNEET proteins. Here, we investigated the ability of cysteine&#8208; and histidine&#8208;containing peptides to coordinate a mononuclear Fe2+ center and a [2Fe&#8208;2S] cluster and compare their properties with purified iron&#8208;sulfur proteins. The iron&#8208;sulfur peptides were characterized by UV&#8208;vis, circular dichroism, and paramagnetic NMR spectroscopies and cyclic voltammetry. Small (&#8804;6 amino acids) peptides can coordinate [2Fe&#8208;2S] clusters through a combination of cysteine and histidine residues with similar reduction potentials as their corresponding proteins. Such complexes may have been important for early cell&#8208;like systems.

         <title>Myricetin Inhibits &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Amyloid Aggregation by Delaying the Liquid&#8208;to&#8208;Solid Phase Transition</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Synuclein (&#945;&#8208;Syn) undergoes liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) to facilitate amyloid aggregation. We discovered that myricetin, a polyhydroxyflavonol compound, does not affect the initial formation of &#945;&#8208;Syn condensates but dose&#8208;dependently inhibits amyloid aggregation by delaying the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transition in the condensates.







Abstract
The aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;Syn) is a critical pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). Prevention of &#945;&#8208;Syn aggregation has become a key strategy for treating PD. Recent studies have suggested that &#945;&#8208;Syn undergoes liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) to facilitate nucleation and amyloid formation. Here, we examined the modulation of &#945;&#8208;Syn aggregation by myricetin, a polyhydroxyflavonol compound, under the conditions of LLPS. Unexpectedly, neither the initial morphology nor the phase&#8208;separated fraction of &#945;&#8208;Syn was altered by myricetin. However, the dynamics of &#945;&#8208;Syn condensates decreased upon myricetin binding. Further studies showed that myricetin dose&#8208;dependently inhibits amyloid aggregation in the condensates by delaying the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transition. In addition, myricetin could disassemble the preformed &#945;&#8208;Syn amyloid aggregates matured from the condensates. Together, our study shows that myricetin inhibits &#945;&#8208;Syn amyloid aggregation in the condensates by retarding the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transition and reveals that &#945;&#8208;Syn phase transition can be targeted to inhibit amyloid aggregation.

         <title>Towards a Better Understanding of Toxin Biosynthesis in Seaweeds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>

Pick and mix: In an impressive new report, the research groups of Chekan and Moore have not only elucidated the biosynthetic pathway of marine toxin domoic acid in the red alga Chondria armata, but also shed light on its complex evolution among marine species. We discuss in this Highlight article the importance of continuing to acquire new data on biosynthetic pathways in marine organisms for both diagnostic and metabolic&#8208;engineering purposes.







Abstract
Harmful algal blooms (HABs) represent both ecological and public health hazards in the marine environment. Indeed, some algae can produce metabolites that have negative effects on marine ecosystems and mammals. Kainoid derivatives such as kainic acid (KA) and domoic acid (DA) are considered some of the most toxic metabolites of marine origin biosynthesized by a limited number of micro&#8208; and macroalgae. While recent works have provided the first insights into the biosynthetic route of KA in red algae and DA in diatoms, the DA biosynthetic pathway has remained uncharacterized for red algae. In a recent work, the research groups of Chekan and Moore have not only elucidated the biosynthetic pathway of DA in the red alga Chondria armata but also shed light on its complex evolution among marine species. We discuss here the importance of pursuing active research in this area to gain insights into secondary biosynthetic pathways in marine organisms for diagnostic and metabolic engineering perspectives.

         <title>Anticancer Activity of Reconstituted Ribonuclease S&#8208;Decorated Artificial Viral Capsid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNase S&#8208;decorated artificial viral capsid that exhibited enzyme activity were constructed by reconstituting &#946;&#8208;annulus&#8208;S&#8208;peptide with S&#8208;protein at neutral pH. The RNase S&#8208;decorated capsids taken up by HepG2 cells exhibited higher RNA degradation and anticancer activity in cells compared with RNase S alone.







Abstract
Ribonuclease S (RNase S) is an enzyme that exhibits anticancer activity by degrading RNAs within cancer cells; however, the cellular uptake efficiency is low due to its small molecular size. Here we generated RNase S&#8208;decorated artificial viral capsids with a size of 70&#8211;170&#8197;nm by self&#8208;assembly of the &#946;&#8208;annulus&#8208;S&#8208;peptide followed by reconstitution with S&#8208;protein at neutral pH. The RNase S&#8208;decorated artificial viral capsids are efficiently taken up by HepG2 cells and exhibit higher RNA degradation activity in cells compared with RNase S alone. Cell viability assays revealed that RNase S&#8208;decorated capsids have high anticancer activity comparable to that of standard anticancer drugs.

         <title>Probing the Substrate Requirements of the In&#8197;Vitro Geranylation Activity of Selenouridine Synthase (SelU)</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selenouridine synthase (SelU, also called mnmH) is an enzyme with a dual activity which catalyzes selenation and geranylation in bacterial tRNAs containing 2&#8208;thiouridine at wobble positions. In this study, we explored the in&#8197;vitro geranylation process of tRNA anticodon stem loops (ASL) mediated by SelU. Our findings suggest a putative mechanism for SelU substrate discrimination and unveil key factors that might influence its enzymatic activity.







Abstract
Natural RNA modifications diversify the structures and functions of existing nucleic acid building blocks. Geranyl is one of the most hydrophobic groups recently identified in bacterial tRNAs. Selenouridine synthase (SelU, also called mnmH) is an enzyme with a dual activity which catalyzes selenation and geranylation in tRNAs containing 2&#8208;thiouridine using selenophosphate or geranyl&#8208;pyrophosphate as cofactors. In this study, we explored the in&#8197;vitro geranylation process of tRNA anticodon stem loops (ASL) mediated by SelU and showed that the geranylation activity was abolished when U35 was mutated to A35 (ASL&#8208;tRNALys(s2U)UU to ASL&#8208;tRNAIle(s2U)AU). By examining the SelU cofactor geranyl&#8208;pyrophosphate (gePP) and its analogues, we found that only the geranyl group, but not dimethylallyl&#8208; and farnesyl&#8208;pyrophosphate with either shorter or longer terpene chains, could be incorporated into ASL. The degree of tRNA geranylation in the end&#8208;point analysis for SelU follows the order of ASLLys(s2UUU)
ASLGln(s2UUG)&gt;ASLGlu(s2UUC). These findings suggest a putative mechanism for substrate discrimination by SelU and reveal key factors that might influence its enzymatic activity. Given that SelU plays an important role in bacterial translation systems, inhibiting this enzyme and targeting its geranylation and selenation pathways could be exploited as a promising strategy to develop SelU&#8208;based antibiotics.

&lt;sub&gt;(s2U)AU&lt;/sub&gt;). By examining the SelU cofactor geranyl-pyrophosphate (gePP) and its analogues, we found that only the geranyl group, but not dimethylallyl- and farnesyl-pyrophosphate with either shorter or longer terpene chains, could be incorporated into ASL. The degree of tRNA geranylation in the end-point analysis for SelU follows the order of ASL&lt;sup&gt;Lys&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;(s2UUU)&lt;/sub&gt;
ASL&lt;sup&gt;Gln&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;(s2UUG)&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;ASL&lt;sup&gt;Glu&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;(s2UUC)&lt;/sub&gt;. These findings suggest a putative mechanism for substrate discrimination by SelU and reveal key factors that might influence its enzymatic activity. Given that SelU plays an important role in bacterial translation systems, inhibiting this enzyme and targeting its geranylation and selenation pathways could be exploited as a promising strategy to develop SelU-based antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diterpenoids from Streptomyces: Structures, Biosyntheses and Bioactivities</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diterpenoids from Streptomyces, which were identified by direct isolation or genome mining, show diverse biological activities and can be potential drug candidates. Biosynthesis of these diterpenoids holds great promise for uncovering novel skeletons of diterpenoids by genome mining in Streptomyces strains.







Abstract
Bacteria, especially Streptomyces spp., have emerged as a rich source for natural diterpenoids with diverse structures and broad bioactivities. Here, we review diterpenoids biosynthesized by Streptomyces, with an emphasis on their structures, biosyntheses, and bioactivities. Although diterpenoids from Streptomyces are relatively rare compared to those from plants and fungi, their novel skeletons, biosyntheses and bioactivities present opportunities for discovering new drugs, enzyme mechanisms, and applications in biocatalysis and metabolic pathway engineering.

         <title>Antibody Recognition of Cancer Cells via Glycan Surface Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modifying cells for selective antibody and immune recognition is a major strategy in cancer treatment. In this study, metabolic glycoengineering of cancer cells and chemical hapten functionalization led to antibody recognition and recruitment.







Abstract
Stimulation of the body's immune system toward tumor cells is now well recognized as a promising strategy in cancer therapy. Just behind cell therapy and monoclonal antibodies, small molecule&#8208;based strategies are receiving growing attention as alternatives to direct immune response against tumor cells. However, the development of small&#8208;molecule approaches to modulate the balance between stimulatory immune factors and suppressive factors in a targeted way remains a challenge. Here, we report the cell surface functionalization of LS174T cancer cells with an abiotic hapten to recruit antibodies to the cell surface. Metabolic glycoengineering followed by covalent reaction with the hapten results in antibody recognition of the target cells. Microscopy and flow cytometry studies provide compelling evidence that metabolic glycoengineering and small molecule stimulators can be combined to direct antibody recognition.

         <title>Conjugation of a Toll&#8208;Like Receptor Agonist to Glycans of an HIV Native&#8208;Like Envelope Trimer Preserves Neutralization Epitopes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Viral glycoprotein immunogens can be modified by a small molecule adjuvant by chemical attachment of an immune&#8208;potentiator to CMP&#8208;Neu5AcN3 followed by transfer to N&#8208;glycans of the glycoprotein. The method was employed to modify a native&#8208;like HIV envelop trimer with an agonist of Toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8. The modification did not compromise structural integrity and Env&#8208;trimer recognition by several broadly neutralization antibodies.







Abstract
Small molecule adjuvants are attractive for enhancing broad protection and durability of immune responses elicited by subunit vaccines. Covalent attachment of an adjuvant to an immunogen is particularly attractive because it simultaneously delivers both entities to antigen presenting cells resulting in more efficient immune activation. There is, however, a lack of methods to conjugate small molecule immune potentiators to viral glycoprotein immunogens without compromising epitope integrity. We describe herein a one&#8208;step enzymatic conjugation approach for the covalent attachment of small molecule adjuvants to N&#8208;linked glycans of viral glycoproteins. It involves the attachment of an immune potentiator to CMP&#8208;Neu5AcN3 by Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne 1,3&#8208;cycloaddition followed by sialyltransferase&#8208;mediated transfer to N&#8208;glycans of a viral glycoprotein. The method was employed to modify a native&#8208;like HIV envelope trimer with a Toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8 agonist. The modification did not compromise Env&#8208;trimer recognition by several broadly neutralization antibodies. Electron microscopy confirmed structural integrity of the modified immunogen.

         <title>Bacterial Peroxidase on Electrochemically Reduced Graphene Oxide for Highly Sensitive H2O2 Detection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peroxidase enzymes enable the construction of electrochemical sensors for highly sensitive and selective quantitative detection of various molecules, pathogens and diseases. Herein, we describe the immobilization of a peroxidase from  Bacillus s.  (BsDyP) on electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) deposited on indium tin oxide (ITO) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) layers. XRD, SEM, AFM, FT&#8208;IR and Raman characterization of the sensor confirmed its structural integrity and a higher enzyme surface occupancy. The BsDyP&#8208;ERGO/ITO/PET electrode performed better than other horseradish peroxidase&#8208;based electrodes, as evinced by an improved electrochemical response in the nanomolar range (linearity 0.05&#8211;280 &#181;M of H  2  O  2  , LOD 32 nM). The bioelectrode was mechanically robust, active in the 3.5&#8211;6 pH range and exhibited no loss of activity upon storage for 7 weeks at 4 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Cell&#8208;Free Protein Synthesis for the Screening of Novel Azoreductases and Their Preferred Electron Donor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A screening approach for azoreductases was developed, including cell&#8208;free protein synthesis of an enzyme library and a multi&#8208;well microplate assay. Applicability to known and novel enzymes was demonstrated, and preferred co&#8208;substrates for each enzyme were evaluated. Five new and yet uncharacterized azoreductases were identified. Furthermore, it was shown that all azoreductases accept the co&#8208;substrate BNAH as an electron donor.







Abstract
Azoreductases are potent biocatalysts for the cleavage of azo bonds. Various gene sequences coding for potential azoreductases are available in databases, but many of their gene products are still uncharacterized. To avoid the laborious heterologous expression in a host organism, we developed a screening approach involving cell&#8208;free protein synthesis (CFPS) combined with a colorimetric activity assay, which allows the parallel screening of putative azoreductases in a short time. First, we evaluated different CFPS systems and optimized the synthesis conditions of a model azoreductase. With the findings obtained, 10 azoreductases, half of them undescribed so far, were screened for their ability to degrade the azo dye methyl red. All novel enzymes catalyzed the degradation of methyl red and can therefore be referred to as azoreductases. In addition, all enzymes degraded the more complex and bulkier azo dye Brilliant Black and four of them also showed the ability to reduce p&#8208;benzoquinone. NADH was the preferred electron donor for the most enzymes, although the synthetic nicotinamide co&#8208;substrate analogue 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) was also accepted by all active azoreductases. This screening approach allows accelerated identification of potential biocatalysts for various applications.

         <title>Exploring the Temperature Effect on Enantioselectivity of a Baeyer&#8208;Villiger Biooxidation by the 2,5&#8208;DKCMO Module: The SLM Approach</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Because the kinetic data did not fit with the usual model of the enantiomeric ratio, E, we used &#8216;Shape Language Modeling&#8217; (SLM) &#8211; a shape prescriptive approach which does not requires a fixed mechanistic&#8208;mathematical model &#8208; to compare the effect of temperature (from 10&#8201;&#176;C to 40&#8201;&#176;C), on the enantioselectivity of Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation by a type&#8197;II BVMO.







Abstract
Temperature is a crucial parameter for biological and chemical processes. Its effect on enzymatically catalysed reactions has been known for decades, and stereo&#8208; and enantiopreference are often temperature&#8208;dependent. For the first time, we present the temperature effect on the Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation of rac&#8208;bicyclo[3.2.0]hept&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;6&#8208;one by the type II Bayer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenase, 2,5&#8208;DKCMO. In the absence of a reductase and driven by the hydride&#8208;donation of a synthetic nicotinamide analogue, the clear trend for a decreasing enantioselectivity at higher temperatures was observed. &#8220;Traditional&#8221; approaches such as the determination of the enantiomeric ratio (E) appeared unsuitable due to the complexity of the system. To quantify the trend, we chose to use the &#8216;Shape Language Modelling&#8217; (SLM), a tool that allows the reaction to be described at all points in a shape prescriptive manner. Thus, without knowing the equation of the reaction, the substrate ee can be estimated that at any conversion.

         <title>A General Strategy for the Design and Evaluation of Heterobifunctional Tools: Applications to Protein Localization and Phase Separation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linkerology 101: This work presents a quantitative method for the rational design of tools to control protein&#8208;protein interactions. A library of probes based on the Trimethoprim&#8208;HaloTag system was synthesized and evaluated. The top&#8208;performing probe was used to control protein localization to various organelles within a cell and to initiate both local and global phase separation.







Abstract
To mimic the levels of spatiotemporal control that exist in nature, tools for chemically induced dimerization (CID) are employed to manipulate protein&#8208;protein interactions. Although linker composition is known to influence speed and efficiency of heterobifunctional compounds, modeling or in&#8197;vitro experiments are often insufficient to predict optimal linker structure. This can be attributed to the complexity of ternary complex formation and the overlapping factors that impact the effective concentration of probe within the cell, such as efflux and passive permeability. Herein, we synthesize a library of modular chemical tools with varying linker structures and perform quantitative microscopy in live cells to visualize dimerization in real&#8208;time. We use our optimized probe to demonstrate our ability to recruit a protein of interest (POI) to the mitochondria, cell membrane, and nucleus. Finally, we induce and monitor local and global phase separation. We highlight the importance of quantitative approaches to linker optimization for dynamic systems and introduce new, synthetically accessible tools for the rapid control of protein localization.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of 6&#8208;O&#8208;Phosphorylated Heparan Sulfate Oligosaccharides to Inhibit Amyloid &#946; Aggregation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 6&#8208;O&#8208;phosphorylated heparan sulfate tetrasaccharide was rationally designed and synthesized to inhibit heparin&#8208;induced amyloid fibril formation of amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) in&#8197;vitro. Its competitive effect was confirmed by a thioflavin T fluorescence assay and a tapping mode atomic force microscopy.







Abstract
Dysregulation of amyloidogenic proteins and their abnormal processing and deposition in tissues cause systemic and localized amyloidosis. Formation of amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) fibrils that deposit as amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains is an earliest pathological hallmark. The polysulfated heparan sulfate (HS)/heparin (HP) is one of the non&#8208;protein components of A&#946; deposits that not only modulates A&#946; aggregation, but also acts as a receptor for A&#946; fibrils to mediate their cytotoxicity. Interfering with the interaction between HS/HP and A&#946; could be a therapeutic strategy to arrest amyloidosis. Here we have synthesized the 6&#8208;O&#8208;phosphorylated HS/HP oligosaccharides and reported their competitive effects on the inhibition of HP&#8208;mediated A&#946; fibril formation in&#8197;vitro using a thioflavin T fluorescence assay and a tapping mode atomic force microscopy.

         <title>Luminescent Assay for the Screening of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 MPro Inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A luminescent assay for the main protease MPro of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 was developed and subsequently used for the screening of inhibitors of the chymotrypsin&#8208;like protease. The caged luminescent peptide probe used in this study releases photons upon proteolytic activity of MPro in the presence of luciferase.







Abstract
Since the outbreak of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in December 2019 millions of infections have been reported globally. The viral chymotrypsin&#8208;like main protease (MPro) exhibits a crucial role in viral replication and represents a relevant target for antiviral drug development. In order to screen potential MPro inhibitors we developed a luminescent assay using a peptide based probe containing a cleavage site specific for MPro. This assay was validated showing IC50 values similar to those reported in the literature for known MPro inhibitors and can be used to screen new inhibitors.

         <title>Advanced Insights into Catalytic and Structural Features of the Zinc&#8208;Dependent Alcohol Dehydrogenase from Thauera aromatica</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The zinc&#8208;dependent MDR&#8722;ADH (medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase&#8722;alcohol dehydrogenase) from Thauera aromatica has a unique substrate preference for sterically demanding &#945;&#8208;substituted linear cyclic carbonyl compounds and a remarkable thermal, pH and solvent stability. Based on high&#8208;resolution structures from X&#8208;ray analysis, structural determinants for the enzyme's special features are introduced.







Abstract
The asymmetric reduction of ketones to chiral hydroxyl compounds by alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) is an established strategy for the provision of valuable precursors for fine chemicals and pharmaceutics. However, most ADHs favor linear aliphatic and aromatic carbonyl compounds, and suitable biocatalysts with preference for cyclic ketones and diketones are still scarce. Among the few candidates, the alcohol dehydrogenase from Thauera aromatica (ThaADH) stands out with a high activity for the reduction of the cyclic &#945;&#8208;diketone 1,2&#8208;cyclohexanedione to the corresponding &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketone. This study elucidates catalytic and structural features of the enzyme. ThaADH showed a remarkable thermal and pH stability as well as stability in the presence of polar solvents. A thorough description of the substrate scope combined with the resolution and description of the crystal structure, demonstrated a strong preference of ThaADH for cyclic &#945;&#8208;substituted cyclohexanones, and indicated structural determinants responsible for the unique substrate acceptance.

This study elucidates catalytic and structural features of the enzyme. ThaADH showed a remarkable thermal and pH stability as well as stability in the presence of polar solvents. A thorough description of the substrate scope combined with the resolution and description of the crystal structure, demonstrated a strong preference of ThaADH for cyclic &#945;-substituted cyclohexanones, and indicated structural determinants responsible for the unique substrate acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Preparation of Cell&#8208;Free ATP Regeneration Module Based on Non&#8208;Oxidative Glycolysis Using Thermophilic Enzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ATP regeneration made simple! We have developed an in&#8197;vitro system for ATP regeneration in a single&#8208;expression strain powered by starch and orthophosphate as the phosphate carrier. This system does not produce harmful byproducts, use costly substrates, or require expression of multiple enzymes. In addition, only heat&#8208;treatment is required for the preparation of this system.







Abstract
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is an essential cofactor for energy&#8208;dependent enzymatic reactions that occur during in&#8197;vitro biochemical conversion. Recently, an enzyme cascade based on non&#8208;oxidative glycolysis, which uses starch and orthophosphate as energy and phosphate sources, respectively, for the regeneration of ATP from adenosine diphosphate, has been developed (Wei et&#8197;al., ChemCatChem 2018, 10, 5597&#8211;5601). However, the 12 enzymes required for this system hampered its practical usability and further testing potential. Here, we addressed this issue by constructing co&#8208;expression vectors for the simultaneous gene expression of the 12 enzymes in a single expression strain. All enzymes were sourced from (hyper)thermophiles, which enabled a one&#8208;step purification via a heat&#8208;treatment process. We showed that the combination of the two enabled the ATP regeneration system to function in a single recombinant Escherichia coli strain. Additionally, this work provides a strategy to rationally design and control proteins expression levels in the co&#8208;expression vectors.

         <title>First Fluorescent Acetylspermidine Deacetylation Assay for HDAC10 Identifies Selective Inhibitors with Cellular Target Engagement
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
HDAC10 is as a polyamine deacetylase from the histone deacetylase (HDAC) family. Using a fluorescent acetylspermidine derivative, we developed the first enzymatic conversion assay for HDAC10. We designed HDAC10 selective inhibitors and demonstrated that they do not cause a lysosomal phenotype previously associated with HDAC10 inhibition in cancer cells.







Abstract
Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are important epigenetic regulators involved in many diseases, especially cancer. Five HDAC inhibitors have been approved for anticancer therapy and many are in clinical trials. Among the 11 zinc&#8208;dependent HDACs, HDAC10 has received relatively little attention by drug discovery campaigns, despite its involvement, e.&#8201;g., in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma. This is due in part to a lack of robust enzymatic conversion assays. In contrast to the protein lysine deacetylase and deacylase activity of most other HDAC subtypes, it has recently been shown that HDAC10 has strong preferences for deacetylation of oligoamine substrates like acetyl&#8208;putrescine or &#8208;spermidine. Hence, it is also termed a polyamine deacetylase (PDAC). Here, we present the first fluorescent enzymatic conversion assay for HDAC10 using an aminocoumarin&#8208;labelled acetyl&#8208;spermidine derivative to measure its PDAC activity, which is suitable for high&#8208;throughput screening. Using this assay, we identified potent inhibitors of HDAC10&#8208;mediated spermidine deacetylation in&#8197;vitro. Based on the oligoamine preference of HDAC10, we also designed inhibitors with a basic moiety in appropriate distance to the zinc binding hydroxamate that showed potent inhibition of HDAC10 with high selectivity, and we solved a HDAC10&#8208;inhibitor structure using X&#8208;ray crystallography. We could demonstrate selective cellular target engagement for HDAC10 but a lysosomal phenotype in neuroblastoma cells that was previously associated with HDAC10 inhibition was not observed. Thus, we have developed new chemical probes for HDAC10 that allow further clarification of the biological role of this enzyme.

         <title>Genetic Survey of Psilocybe Natural Products</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond the magic: Psilocybe mushrooms are known for their psychotropic effects. Yet, some species are suspected to cause paralysis. A genomic survey revealed an unexpectedly diverse repertoire of natural product genes in these mushrooms, much more diverse than evident by chemical analyses. Knowledge on the realm of the Psilocybe secondary metabolome helps anticipate potential toxicities in this iconic fungal genus.







Abstract
Psilocybe magic mushrooms are best known for their main natural product, psilocybin, and its dephosphorylated congener, the psychedelic metabolite psilocin. Beyond tryptamines, the secondary metabolome of these fungi is poorly understood. The genomes of five species (P. azurescens, P. cubensis, P.&#8197;cyanescens, P. mexicana, and P. serbica) were browsed to understand more profoundly common and species&#8208;specific metabolic capacities. The genomic analyses revealed a much greater and yet unexplored metabolic diversity than evident from parallel chemical analyses. P. cyanescens and P. mexicana were identified as aeruginascin producers. Lumichrome and verpacamide A were also detected as Psilocybe metabolites. The observations concerning the potential secondary metabolome of this fungal genus support pharmacological and toxicological efforts to find a rational basis for yet elusive phenomena, such as paralytic effects, attributed to consumption of some magic mushrooms.

         <title>Seeking Citius: Photochemical Access of Reactive Intermediates for Faster Bioorthogonal Reactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An attractive strategy to increase reaction kinetics in bioorthogonal chemistry is to access highly reactive intermediates in&#8197;situ. This article discusses efficient photochemical generation of two reactive intermediates&#8212;nitrile imine and tetrazine&#8212;from their stable and unreactive precursors and their subsequent use in rapid bioorthogonal labeling of proteins in live cells.







Abstract
Fast bioorthogonal reactions are sought after because of their superior performance in labeling low&#8208;abundance biomolecules in native cellular environments. An attractive strategy to increase reaction kinetics is to access the reactive intermediates through photochemical activation. To this end, significant progress was made in the last few years in harnessing two highly reactive intermediates&#8212;nitrile imine and tetrazine&#8212;generated through photoinduced ring rupture and catalytic photooxidation, respectively. The efficient capture of these reactive intermediates by their cognate reaction partners has enabled bioorthogonal fluorescent labeling of biomolecules in live cells.

         <title>N&#8208;terminal Cationic Modification of Linear Pyrrole&#8208;Imidazole Polyamide Improves Its Binding to DNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrrole&#8208;imidazole polyamides (PIPs) bind to double&#8208;stranded B&#8208;DNA with sequence specificity. Linear PIPs have low molecular weight and recognize long sequences, but have low affinities. In this study, using DNA denaturation, surface plasmon resonance, and circular dichroism, we demonstrate that the cationic N&#8208;terminus modification of linear PIPs improves the affinity to DNA.







Abstract
Pyrrole&#8208;imidazole polyamides (PIPs) bind to double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) with varied sequence selectivity. We synthesized linear PIPs that can bind to narrow minor grooves of polypurine/polypyrimidine sequences and target long recognition sequences but have lower molecular weights than commonly used hairpin PIPs. We modified the N&#8208;terminus of linear PIPs using several groups, including &#946;&#8208;alanine extension and acetyl capping. Melting curve analysis of dsDNA demonstrated that cationic modifications improved the binding affinity of the PIPs to the targeted dsDNA. In addition, circular dichroism assays revealed the characteristic spectra depending on the binding stoichiometry of the N&#8208;cationic linear PIP and dsDNA (1&#8201;:&#8201;1, monomeric; 2&#8201;:&#8201;1, dimeric).

     alt="N-terminal Cationic Modification of Linear Pyrrole-Imidazole Polyamide Improves Its Binding to DNA"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pyrrole-imidazole polyamides&lt;/b&gt; (PIPs) bind to double-stranded B-DNA with sequence specificity. Linear PIPs have low molecular weight and recognize long sequences, but have low affinities. In this study, using DNA denaturation, surface plasmon resonance, and circular dichroism, we demonstrate that the cationic N-terminus modification of linear PIPs improves the affinity to DNA.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pyrrole-imidazole polyamides (PIPs) bind to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) with varied sequence selectivity. We synthesized linear PIPs that can bind to narrow minor grooves of polypurine/polypyrimidine sequences and target long recognition sequences but have lower molecular weights than commonly used hairpin PIPs. We modified the N-terminus of linear PIPs using several groups, including &#946;-alanine extension and acetyl capping. Melting curve analysis of dsDNA demonstrated that cationic modifications improved the binding affinity of the PIPs to the targeted dsDNA. In addition, circular dichroism assays revealed the characteristic spectra depending on the binding stoichiometry of the N-cationic linear PIP and dsDNA (1&#8201;:&#8201;1, monomeric; 2&#8201;:&#8201;1, dimeric). Surface plasmon resonance assays confirmed the high binding affinities of linear PIPs. These findings may aid in the design of effective linear PIPs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Influence of Ring Modifications on Nucleolar Stress Caused by Oxaliplatin&#8208;Like Compounds
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A limited structure&#8208;function study of Pt(II) compounds bearing modifications at the 4&#8208;position of the 1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (DACH) ligand shows that compounds with methyl, ethyl, and propyl substituents induce nucleolar stress, while ones with isopropyl and acetamide substituents do not. These results suggest a more complex picture of nucleolar stress induction by Pt(II) compounds.







Abstract
Oxaliplatin, a platinum compound in broad clinical use, can induce cell death through a nucleolar stress pathway rather than the canonical DNA damage response studied for other Pt(II) compounds. Previous work has found that the oxaliplatin 1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (DACH) ring but not the oxalate leaving group is important to the ability to induce nucleolar stress. Here we study the influence of DACH ring substituents at the 4&#8208;position on the ability of DACH&#8722;Pt(II) compounds to cause nucleolar stress. We determine that DACH&#8722;Pt(II) compounds with 4&#8208;position methyl, ethyl, or propyl substituents induce nucleolar stress, but DACH&#8722;Pt(II) compounds with 4&#8208;isopropyl substituents do not induce nucleolar stress. This effect is independent of whether the substituent is in the axial or equatorial position relative to the trans diamines of the ligand. These results suggest that spatially sensitive interactions could be involved in the ability of platinum compounds to cause nucleolar stress.

         <title>High Versatility of IPP and DMAPP Methyltransferases Enables Synthesis of C6, C7 and C8 Terpenoid Building Blocks</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nearly all known terpenes are built from the two C5 precursors DMAPP and IPP. This work characterizes several bacterial DMAPP and IPP methyltransferases that convert these building blocks in C6, C7 and C8 prenyl pyrophosphates with selectivity on deprotonation sites and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
The natural substance class of terpenoids covers an extremely wide range of different structures, although their building block repertoire is limited to the C5 compounds DMAPP and IPP. This study aims at the characterization of methyltransferases (MTases) that modify these terpene precursors and the demonstration of their suitability for biotechnological purposes. All seven enzymes tested accepted IPP as substrate and altogether five C6 compounds and six C7 compounds were formed within the reactions. A high selectivity for the deprotonation site as well as high stereoselectivity could be observed for most of the biocatalysts. Only the enzyme from Micromonospora humi also accepted DMAPP as substrate, converting it into (2R)&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;IPP in&#8197;vitro. In vivo studies demonstrated the production of a C8 compound and a hydride shift step within the MTase&#8208;catalyzed reaction. Our study presents IPP / DMAPP MTases with very different catalytic properties, which provide biosynthetic access to many novel terpene&#8208;derived structures.

         <title>The Dynamic Range of Acidity: Tracking Rules for the Unidirectional Penetration of Cellular Compartments</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Changing color like lobsters during cooking, flipper probes with cationic acids are introduced to elucidate the mechanics of early endocytosis, and to reveal universal tracking rules for unidirectional penetration along transmembrane pH gradients. Consistent with a dynamic range of &#916;pKa=3.5 for temporary deprotonation, cationic acids with pKa=9.8 stay only within more acidic early endosomes (pH &#8764;6.3), while those with pKa=10.6 track also the less acidic ones (pH &#8764;6.5). For these early endosomes, cationic acids with pKa=7.4 are too acidic for retention, those with pKa=13.5 are too basic for penetration. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Matile et&#8197;al.

         <title>Context&#8208;Dependence of the Reactivity of Cysteine and Lysine Residues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cys reactivity towards a maleimide and Lys reactivity towards an N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester can depend on the position of the residue in the protein sequence. Cys reactivity decreases markedly in the order N&#8208;terminal&gt;in&#8208;chain&gt;C&#8208;terminal due to modulation of the sulfhydryl pKa value by proximal charges and allowing for selective modification. In contrast, differences in Lys reactivity are too small to allow for site&#8208;selective modification with an NHS ester.







Abstract
The S&#8208;alkylation of Cys residues with a maleimide and the N&#1013;&#8208;acylation of Lys residues with an N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester are common methods for bioconjugation. Using Cys and Lys derivatives as proxies, we assessed differences in reactivity depending on the position of Cys or Lys in a protein sequence. We find that Cys position is exploitable to improve site&#8208;selectivity in maleimide&#8208;based modifications. Reactivity decreases substantially in the order N&#8208;terminal&gt;in&#8208;chain&gt;C&#8208;terminal Cys due to modulation of sulfhydryl pKa by the &#945;&#8208;ammonium and carboxylate groups at the termini. A lower pKa value yields a larger fraction thiolate, which promotes selectivity while somewhat decreasing thiolate nucleophilicity in accord with 
=0.41. Lowering pH and salt concentration enhances selectivity still further. In contrast, differences in the reactivity of Lys towards an NHS ester were modest due to an appreciable decrease in amino group nucleophilicity with a lower pKa of its conjugate acid. Hence, site&#8208;selective Lys modification protocols will require electrophiles other than NHS esters.

         <title>Investigation of &#946;&#8208;Substitution Activity of O&#8208;Acetylserine Sulfhydrolase from Citrullus vulgaris</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of O&#8208;acetylserine sulfhydrolase from Citrullus vulgaris was explored. This enzyme does not have mimosine synthase activity, but it is capable of promiscuous C&#8722;O bond formation.

Pyridoxal&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP)&#8208;dependent enzymes have garnered interest for their ability to synthesize non&#8208;standard amino acids (nsAAs). One such class of enzymes, O&#8208;acetylserine sulfhydrylases (OASSs), catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of l&#8208;cysteine. Here, we examine the &#946;&#8208;substitution capability of the OASS from Citrullus vulgaris (CvOASS), a putative l&#8208;mimosine synthase. While the previously reported mimosine synthase activity was not reproducible in our hands, we successfully identified non&#8208;native reactivity with a variety of O&#8208;nucleophiles. Optimization of reaction conditions for carboxylate and phenolate substrates led to distinct conditions that were leveraged for the preparative&#8208;scale synthesis of nsAAs. We further show this enzyme is capable of C&#8722;C bond formation through a &#946;&#8208;alkylation reaction with an activated nitroalkane. To facilitate understanding of this enzyme, we determined the crystal structure of the enzyme bound to PLP as the internal aldimine at 1.55&#8197;&#197;, revealing key features of the active site and providing information that may guide subsequent development of CvOASS as a practical biocatalyst.

The convenient synthesis of a broad series of versatile alkyne&#8208;spacer derivatives from the well&#8208;known Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction on diazenyl&#8208;pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;amine compounds is reported.

Abstract
A convenient synthesis of a broad series of thirteen examples of alkyne&#8208;spacer derivatives 2 from the well&#8208;known Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction on diazenyl&#8208;pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;amine compounds 1 is reported. The reactivity of heterocycles 1 due the presence of selected electron&#8208;donor (EDG) and electron&#8208;withdrawing (EWG) groups attached to different alkynes was evaluated. Also, the reactional versatility due the position variation of the bromo atom at the scaffolds 1 was also investigated. In general, derivatives presented strong absorption bands at the 250&#8211;500&#8197;nm optical window and UV to cyan emission properties. Also, the redox analysis was recorded by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry technique. For HSA biomacromolecule assays, spectroscopic studies by UV&#8208;Vis, steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved emission fluorescence, and molecular docking calculations evidenced the ability of each compound to establish interactions with human serum albumin (HSA). Finally, the behavior presented for this new class of heterocycles makes them a promising tool as optical sensors for albumins.

         <title>Chemical Diversity and Biosynthesis of Drimane&#8208;Type Sesquiterpenes in the Fungal Kingdom</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fungal drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpenes (DTSs) are emerging as a very interesting class of chemicals with many notable activities. Elucidation of DTS biosynthesis in fungi revealed that the two main precursors, drimenol and drim&#8208;8&#8208;ene&#8208;11&#8208;ol, are the preferred backbones. Hence, hundreds of different fungal DTS derivatives have been isolated and identified, suggesting that they are relevant secondary metabolites in the fungal kingdom.







Abstract
Drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpenes are a class of compounds produced by a wide range of organisms, initially isolated and characterized in plants. Meanwhile, in the past 20&#8211;30&#8197;years, a large number of novel structures from many divergent fungi have been elucidated. Recently, the biosynthesis of drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpenes and their esters has been explained in two filamentous fungi, namely Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus calidoustus, disclosing the basic biosynthetic principles needed to identify similar pathways in the fungal kingdom.

         <title>Pyrimidine&#8208;Based Fluorescent Probe for Monitoring Mitophagy via Detection of Mitochondrial pH Variation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyrimidine&#8208;based fluorescent probe, Z2, was designed to monitor the mitophagy process by detection of mitochondrial pH variation. This probe exhibits a strong turn&#8208;on fluorescence signal when detecting low pH without any interference, and achieves mitophagy monitoring in cells and visualization of the pH variation in Caenorhabditis elegans.







Abstract
Impaired mitophagy hinders the clearance of damaged mitochondria, inducing pathological states. Knowledge of this phenomenon is key to diagnosing certain diseases and understanding their pathogenesis. Mitophagy involves an acidization process that could serve as an ideal detection target. In this work, we designed and synthesized a mitochondrial&#8208;targeting fluorescence probe, Z2, for evaluating pH variation. This probe exhibited remarkable &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence under acidic conditions. In biological applications, Z2 showed a strong, specific pH detection capacity in Parkin&#8208;overexpressing HeLa cells during the mitophagy process. The &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence property of Z2 was also used to detect pH variations in Caenorhabditis elegans. This probe, as a novel pH assessment tool, may facilitate further research of mitophagy&#8208;associated pathological patterns.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and In Vivo Fluorescence Imaging Study of a Cytochrome P450 1B1 Targeted NIR Probe Containing a Chelator Moiety</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near infrared (NIR) probe with a chelator moiety targeting CYP1B1 was developed by conjugating &#945;&#8208;naphthoflavone (ANF) derivatives with both an NIR dye and a chelator for metal labelling. This probe could be a promising tool for the detection of tumors and for studying the expression of CYP1B1 during tumorigenesis.alpha&#8208;naphthoflavone derivativeschelatorcytochrome P450 1B1 enzymemolecular imaging, NIR probes







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1B1 has been found to be overexpressed specifically in tumor tissues at an early stage, which makes it a potential cancer biomarker for molecular imaging. Multimodal imaging combines different imaging modalities and offers more comprehensive information. Thus, imaging probes bearing more than one kind of signal fragment have been extensively explored and display great promise. Herein, we developed a near infrared (NIR) probe with a chelator moiety targeting CYP1B1 by conjugating &#945;&#8208;naphthoflavone (ANF) derivatives with both an NIR dye and a chelator for potential application in bimodal imaging. Enzymatic inhibitory studies demonstrated inhibitory activity against CYP1B1 and selectivity among CYP1 were successfully retained after chemical modification. Cell&#8208;based saturation studies indicated nanomolar range binding affinity between the probe and CYP1B1 overexpressed cancer cells. In vitro competitive binding assays monitored by confocal microscopy revealed that the probe could specifically accumulate in tumor cells. In vivo and ex vivo imaging studies demonstrated that the probe could effectively light&#8208;up the tumor tissues as early as 2&#8197;hours post&#8208;injection. In addition, the fluorescence was significantly blocked by co&#8208;injection of CYP1B1 inhibitor, which indicated the probe accumulation in tumor sites was due to specific binding to CYP1B1.

         <title>Connecting Algal Polysaccharide Degradation to Formaldehyde Detoxification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidative demethylation of 6&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;galactose produces formaldehyde. Marine bacteria that utilize this sugar in the degradation of porphyran must therefore possess suitable formaldehyde detoxification pathways. The connection between the degradation of marine carbohydrates and the detoxification of formaldehyde has been demonstrated for the marine model organism Zobellia galactanivorans.







Abstract
Formaldehyde is a toxic metabolite that is formed in large quantities during bacterial utilization of the methoxy sugar 6&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;galactose, an abundant monosaccharide in the red algal polysaccharide porphyran. Marine bacteria capable of metabolizing porphyran must therefore possess suitable detoxification systems for formaldehyde. We demonstrate here that detoxification of formaldehyde in the marine Flavobacterium Zobellia galactanivorans proceeds via the ribulose monophosphate pathway. Simultaneously, we show that the genes encoding the key enzymes of this pathway are important for maintaining high formaldehyde resistance. Additionally, these genes are upregulated in the presence of porphyran, allowing us to connect porphyran degradation to the detoxification of formed formaldehyde.

         <title>The Dynamic Range of Acidity: Tracking Rules for the Unidirectional Penetration of Cellular Compartments</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Universal tracking rules for cationic fluorescent membrane tension probes are obtained around the edge of their dynamic range of acidity, focusing on early endosomes in comparison to late endosomes, lysosomes, Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane, and on practical relevance to image the mechanics at the very beginning of endocytosis.







Abstract
Labeled ammonium cations with pKa&#8764;7.4 accumulate in acidic organelles because they can be neutralized transiently to cross the membrane at cytosolic pH&#8197;7.2 but not at their internal pH&lt;5.5. Retention in early endosomes with less acidic internal pH was achieved recently using weaker acids of up to pKa 9.8. We report here that primary ammonium cations with higher pKa 10.6, label early endosomes more efficiently. This maximized early endosome tracking coincides with increasing labeling of Golgi networks with similarly weak internal acidity. Guanidinium cations with pKa 13.5 cannot cross the plasma membrane in monomeric form and label the plasma membrane with selectivity for vesicles embarking into endocytosis. Self&#8208;assembled into micelles, guanidinium cations enter cells like arginine&#8208;rich cell&#8208;penetrating peptides and, driven by their membrane potential, penetrate mitochondria unidirectionally despite their high inner pH. The resulting tracking rules with an approximated dynamic range of pKa change &#8764;3.5 are expected to be generally valid, thus enabling the design of chemistry tools for biology research in the broadest sense. From a practical point of view, most relevant are two complementary fluorescent flipper probes that can be used to image the mechanics at the very beginning of endocytosis.

         <title>Identification of Genes Essential for Sulfamate and Fluorine Incorporation During Nucleocidin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleocidin is an adenosine analogue containing rare fluorinated and sulfamated moieties from unknown biosynthetic origins. Using gene disruption, we have identified three genes essential for sulfamation, and three for sulfamation and fluorination. Additionally, two new acetylated nucleocidin derivatives were also discovered.







Abstract
Nucleocidin is an adenosine derivative containing 4&#8217;&#8208;fluoro and 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;sulfamoyl substituents. In this study, nucleocidin biosynthesis is examined in two newly discovered producers, Streptomyces virens B&#8208;24331 and Streptomyces aureorectus B&#8208;24301, which produce nucleocidin and related derivatives at titers 30&#8208;fold greater than S. calvus. This enabled the identification of two new O&#8208;acetylated nucleocidin derivatives, and a potential glycosyl&#8208;O&#8208;acetyltransferase. Disruption of nucJ, nucG, and nucI, within S. virens B&#8208;24331, specifying a radical SAM/Fe&#8722;S dependent enzyme, sulfatase, and arylsulfatase, respectively, led to loss of 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;sulfamoyl biosynthesis, but not fluoronucleoside production. Disruption of nucN, nucK, and nucO specifying an amidinotransferase, and two sulfotransferases respectively, led to loss of fluoronucleoside production. Identification of S. virens B&#8208;24331 as a genetically tractable and high producing strain sets the stage for understanding nucleocidin biosynthesis and highlights the utility of using 16S&#8208;RNA sequences to identify alternative producers of valuable compounds in the absence of genome sequence data.
