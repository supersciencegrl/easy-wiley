         <title>Developing FGF2 Mutants with Selectively Reduced Heparan Sulfate Affinity to Explore their Impact on FGFR1 Signaling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism by which the coreceptor heparan sulfate (HS) contributes to Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)/FGF receptor (FGFR) signaling remains unclear. In this study, FGF2 mutants with selectively reduced HS affinity were rationally designed through in silico analysis. Analyses of designed mutants provided important insights, suggesting that the contribution of FGF2/HS interaction to FGF2/FGFR signaling may be limited.

Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)regulates signal transduction by forming complexes with its receptors, FGF receptors (FGFRs), and heparan sulfate (HS), playing a crucial role in biological systems. Although HS has been suggested to modulate FGF/FGFR signaling as a coreceptor, multiple hypotheses exist regarding how HS affects FGF/FGFR signaling and the mechanism remains unclear. Herein, to highlight the role of FGF2/HS interaction in FGF2/FGFR1 signaling, FGF2 mutants with reduced HS&#8208;binding affinity are rationally designed through in silico analysis. These FGF2 mutants exhibit reduced HS affinity by more than two orders of magnitude while maintaining binding affinity to FGFR1. In addition, these mutants retain their thermal stability. Cellular assays using the FGF2 mutant suggest that, contrary to previous reports, the contribution of the FGF2/HS interaction in FGF2/FGFR1 signaling may be limited. The mutant FGFs that specifically alter the interaction with HS, achieved in this study, would contribute to an understanding of the role of FGF/HS interaction in FGF/FGFR signaling.

         <title>Toxicity of Antisense Oligonucleotides is Determined by the Synergistic Interplay of Chemical Modifications and Nucleotide Sequences, Not by Either Factor Alone</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) hold promise for precise RNA modulation but face major toxicity challenges. Traditional optimization treats sequence and chemistry separately, relying on limited chemistries or costly trial&#8208;and&#8208;error screens. This study reveals ASO toxicity arises from the synergistic interplay of sequence, chemical modifications, and positional context&#8212;underscoring the need for rational, integrated design strategies to develop safe, effective ASO therapeutics.

Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) offer a promising therapeutic approach for precise RNA&#8208;level gene modulation. Despite advancements in chemical modifications to enhance stability and pharmacokinetics, ASOs still face significant challenges, including liver, immunological, renal, and neurological toxicities, potentially leading to high preclinical failure rates. Current oligonucleotide&#8208;based drug optimization strategies to overcome such issues often rely on applying a few commonly used chemical architectures (patterns of linker, sugar, or base modifications), which are conventional in the field, or engaging in expensive and time&#8208;consuming trial&#8208;and&#8208;error screening processes involving both sequence changes and positional chemical modifications. These traditional approaches treat nucleotide sequences (&#8220;sequence&#8221;) and sugar/linkage modification chemistries (&#8220;chemistry&#8221;) as independent contributors to toxicity. However, ample evidence in the literature shows that even minor changes in either sequence or chemical modifications can drastically impact toxicity, suggesting an inseparable synergistic relationship between sequence and chemistry. In support of this sequence&#8208;chemistry collusion thesis, this manuscript presents a survey of the systemic toxicity potential of several chemically modified gapmer ASOs by investigating the impact of modifying sugar and backbone chemistries on ASO&#8208;induced hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and immune/inflammatory responses. The data unequivocally demonstrate that ASO toxicity is strongly influenced by the interplay between nucleotide sequence, chemical modifications, and the specific position context of those modifications, highlighting the critical need to rationally engineer the optimal sequence and chemical composition to develop safe and active ASO drug candidates instead of discovering suboptimal ASOs through trial&#8208;and&#8208;error screening campaigns.

         <title>Improving the Gastric Resilience of Ferritin Nanocages by Fabrication with Gelatin for the Development of Oral Iron Supplements</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gelatin fabrication improved the structural stability and iron retention capacity of frog M ferritins under simulated gastric conditions.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most common nutritional deficiency in the world, particularly affecting children and women. The first&#8208;line treatment for IDA is oral iron supplementation, preferred for its cost&#8208;effectiveness and convenience of administration but is often accompanied by side effects like oxidative stress, infections, and low&#8208;solubility/precipitation. This study explores the use of ferritins&#8212;self&#8208;assembled nanocage proteins serving as soluble cellular&#8208;iron reservoirs&#8212;as a safer alternative for oral iron intervention. Ideal oral iron supplements must withstand gastric conditions, not trigger oxidative stress, and reach the absorption site intact. DNA protection assays and microbial growth studies demonstrate the antioxidative properties of ferritin, contrary to ferrous salts, underscoring its potential as a safer iron supplement. While ferritin shows commendable gastric tolerance, prolonged exposure can hamper its structural integrity/mineral retention. To further enhance its stability, ferritin is fabricated with gelatins, which preserved its structure/iron content under simulated gastric conditions. The combination of inherent antioxidant and controlled iron release properties of ferritin with gelatin's protective effect could help overcome the limitations of the commercial supplements. The findings of this study could pave the way for the development of "gelatin&#8208;coated iron&#8208;loaded ferritin"&#8208;based oral formulations as a safer option for IDA management.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Mediated Base Pairs in Nucleic Acids: Selective Coordination to Natural and Thiocarbonyl&#8208;Modified Cytosines Dependent upon the Oxidation State of Gold</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective coordination of gold ions to mismatched cytosines in nucleic acid duplexes is achieved via oxidation&#8208;state&#8208;dependent interactions. While Au(I) binds to natural cytosine&#8211;cytosine pairs, cytosine thiolation promotes square&#8208;planar coordination with Au(III), offering a structure&#8208;guided approach to redox&#8208;tunable nucleic acid architectures.

Gold&#8208;mediated base pairing in nucleic acids has remained poorly understood, despite structural analogies with mercury and silver ions known to coordinate selectively to mismatched base pairs. Here, the crystal structures of a C&#63743;Au(I)&#63743;C base pair and a C&#63743;G&#63743;Au(I)&#63743;C base triple formed with natural nucleobases are reported. Although solution&#8208;phase thermodynamic analysis of Au(I) coordination is technically unfeasible, structural evidence supports its selective insertion into the base&#160;mismatches. In contrast, duplexes incorporating 2&#8208;thiocytosine form square&#8208;planar complexes with Au(III), and melting temperature analysis shows significant thermal stabilization. The distinct coordination geometries of Au(I) and Au(III) arise from differences in oxidation state and preferred coordination numbers, with Au(I) favoring linear two&#8208;coordinate structures and Au(III) forming square&#8208;planar complexes stabilized by thiocarbonyl donors. These findings establish a structure&#8208;guided strategy for oxidation&#8208;state&#8208;selective metal coordination in nucleic acids, paving the way for the design of metal&#8208;responsive DNA architectures with tunable properties.

         <title>Structural and Spectroscopic Insights into Catalytic Intermediates of a [NiFe]&#8208;hydrogenase from Group 3</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>


Hydrogenases catalyze reversible H2 production and are potential models for renewable energy catalysts. Here, the full redox landscape of a group 3 [NiFe]&#8208;hydrogenase from methanothermococcus thermolithotrophicus is elucidated, resembling group 1 enzymes. Structural and spectroscopic analyses reveal a catalytic&#8208;ready state with nickel seesaw coordination, enabling intermediate trapping and advancing mechanistic understanding of oxygen&#8208;sensitive [NiFe] enzymes.

         <title>C&#8208;6&#8208;Modified 2&#8208;F&#8208;Fucose Derivatives as Inhibitors of Fucosyltransferases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of C6&#8208;modified guanosine&#8208;diphosphate&#8208;2&#8208;F&#8208;fucose analogs and corresponding prodrugs are designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated as inhibitors of cellular fucosylation. Certain analogs potently inhibit fucosyltransferases (FUT) FUT1, 3, 6, and 9 while showing minimal activity for FUT8, highlighting the potential for selective FUT targeting.

Fluorinated analogs of guanosine&#8208;diphosphate&#8208;&#946;&#8208;L&#8208;fucose (GDP&#8208;Fuc) have received considerable attention for the development of inhibitors of fucosyltransferases (FUTs). These compounds can be recognized by FUTs but do not transfer or transfer slowly the fluorinated fucosyl residue because the electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorine(s) destabilize the oxocarbenium&#8208;like transition state. Fluorinated GDP&#8208;Fuc analogs can also act as feedback inhibitor of the de novo biosynthetic pathway of GDP&#8208;Fuc. To investigate the biological significance of distinct glycoconjugate classes, it is important to develop inhibitors that can selectively target specific FUT enzymes. The design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a series of GDP&#8208;2&#8208;F&#8208;Fuc analogs modified at C&#8208;6 of Fuc by various amides and ethers are reported. Corresponding prodrugs are also prepared and examined as potential FUT inhibitors of cellular glycosylation. The findings reveal that two of the inhibitors potently inhibited FUT1, 3, 6, and 9, while displaying minimal activity against FUT8. However, the corresponding prodrugs do not inhibit cellular fucosylation, which is probably due to a lack of GDP&#8208;fucose pyrophosphorylase activity. The results demonstrate that modifications at the C&#8208;6 position of Fuc can confer selectivity, although further investigations of alternative functional groups are required to enhance cellular tolerance and efficacy.

         <title>Interactions of Neurodegenerative Disease Positron Emission Tomography Imaging Probe Candidates with the C&#8208;Terminus of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Fibrils</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binding studies of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;S) fibril ligands using photo&#8208;crosslinking mass spectrometry and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer show that the multiple system atrophy (MSA)&#8208;selective lead, HY&#8208;215, interacts with the &#945;S C&#8208;terminus, unlike Parkinson's disease (PD)&#8208;selective lead, M503. Thus, often&#8208;ignored interactions with the disordered regions of &#945;S fibrils may be important in the development of positron emission tomography imaging probes and other therapeutic small molecules for PD and MSA.

Fibrillar aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;S) is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) and related disorders, including multiple system atrophy (MSA) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Herein, the fibril interactions of two candidate positron emission tomography (PET) imaging ligands, M503 and HY&#8208;215, being developed for imaging of PD/DLB and MSA, respectively, are investigated. Photo&#8208;crosslinking mass spectrometry is used to determine the sites of their binding to in&#8201;vitro fibrils, and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer with fluorescently labeled proteins is used to analyze conformational changes in the disordered &#945;S C&#8208;terminus. Taken together, these studies show that the MSA&#8208;selective PET lead, HY&#8208;215, interacts with the C&#8208;terminus, unlike the PD&#8208;selective lead M503. This study indicates that interactions with the often&#8208;ignored disordered regions of &#945;S fibrils should be considered in the development of PET probes and other therapeutic small molecules.

Studies conducted since the late 1990s show substantial activity of selected citrus flavonoids as cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) membrane protein activators. The thesis of this work is that aptly formulated citrus flavonoids hold sigificant potential for developing a multitarget treatment of cystic fibrosis combining in a single treatment antimicrobial, anti&#8208;inflammatory, CFTR&#8208;stimulating, and immunomodulatory properties, as required by a genetic disease eventually causing chronic lung inflammation and bacterial infection reinforcing each other.

         <title>Rieske Oxygenase&#8208;Catalyzed Biotransformations in Recombinant Cupriavidus necator Fueled by Formate Oxidation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, formatotrophic biotransformations in recombinant Cupriavidus necator catalyzed by Rieske oxygenases (ROs) toward various oxyfunctionalized olefins are demonstrated. The oxidation of formate regenerates NADH, the ROs&#8217; cofactor, essentially fueling the reaction. The formatotrophically cultivated cells performed at the same efficiency as heterotrophically grown cells of the same strain. NDO: naphthalene dioxygenase, CDO: cumene dioxygenase. CBB cycle: Calvin&#8208;Benson&#8208;Bassham cycle.

The use of single carbon (C1) molecules, such as carbon dioxide or formate, is crucial in the transition from a linear, petroleum&#8208;based economy to a circular bioeconomy. Formate can serve as both a carbon and energy source, further enhancing its attractiveness as a feedstock. Cupriavidus necator, a lithoautotrophic microbial chassis strain, provides an opportunity to leverage formate for the synthesis of valuable products. However, its ability to grow on formate and the subsequent coupling of that process to recombinantly produced redox enzymes for the efficient production of high&#8208;value&#8208;added products in a biotransformation has not yet been established. Here, we report the development of a formate&#8208;driven C. necator whole&#8208;cell chassis that recombinantly produces Rieske oxygenases (ROs) and elaborate on possible stress responses of the cells during formatotrophic cultivation. The whole&#8208;cell chassis efficiently catalyzes the oxyfunctionalization of olefins fueled by formate oxidation. For instance, styrene is dihydroxylated to (R)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diol in an excellent 95% yield and with good enantioselectivity (74% ee) under formatotrophic conditions. The product yield and optical purity obtained demonstrate the synthetic usefulness of formate&#8208;fueled whole&#8208;cell bio&#8208;transformations in C. necator.

         <title>Model&#8208;Based Optimization of Fed&#8208;Batch In Vitro Transcription</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a mathematical model for the enzyme kinetics and solution thermodynamics of the in vitro transcription reaction, new optimized strategies are developed for fed&#8208;batch transcription that can decrease the resource costs of mRNA synthesis while maintaining critical quality attributes for efficacy in vivo.

Recent developments in RNA vaccines and therapeutics have motivated the need for process engineering strategies to optimize the in vitro transcription (IVT) reaction for RNA synthesis. Specifically, practitioners seek to maximize the production of RNA and the incorporation of the 5&#8208;prime cap to the end of each RNA molecule while minimizing the use of expensive reagents. Fed&#8208;batch IVT is a promising technique for achieving these goals but is difficult to optimize by purely experimental means. Herein, a mechanistic model for fed&#8208;batch IVT is developed and it is used to develop optimized fed&#8208;batch protocols to maximize the formation of RNA while controlling concentrations of nucleoside triphosphates. On a model sequence that has been shown to be sensitive to salt concentrations, this approach can produce twice as much RNA as a heuristic approach. In addition, it is observed and characterized for the first time the formation of magnesium phosphate crystals during the IVT reaction. Strategies informed by thermodynamic modeling are developed to prevent this undesired crystallization during fed&#8208;batch IVT. Finally, co&#8208;transcriptional capping is incorporated into the model&#8208;based optimization approach and a strategy to maximize RNA formation is developed while maintaining a high level of 5&#8208;prime cap incorporation and minimizing the use of cap analogs.

         <title>Ratiometric Detection of pH&#8208;Induced i&#8208;Motif Folding Based on a Dual Emissive Cytosine Analog</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;emissive cytosine analog enables ratiometric fluorescence detection of i&#8208;motif DNA folding. This study reveals a sensitive method to monitor pH&#8208;dependent i&#8208;motif conformational changes, providing a valuable tool for investigating DNA secondary structures in&#8201;vitro.

A dual&#8208;emissive cytosine analog (TCC), based on a 2&#8208;thienyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxychromone scaffold, is incorporated into oligodeoxynucleotides to monitor the folding state of DNA i&#8208;motif structures. This modified nucleobase exhibits two distinct emission bands (IN* and IT*), each responding differently to microenvironmental changes, enabling ratiometric detection. The photophysical properties of TCC are systematically characterized in various solvents and DNA contexts, including single&#8208;stranded, double&#8208;stranded, and i&#8208;motif&#8208;forming sequences. The IN*/IT* emission ratio and the wavelength of the IT* band act as robust and orthogonal reporters of hydration, base stacking, and protonation states. In fully paired duplexes, the T* band is quenched and blue&#8208;shifted, while i&#8208;motif folding results in both fluorescence enhancement and a redshift of the T* emission. Additionally, the probe distinguishes mismatched base pairs and abasic sites, offering further insights into local structural defects. Overall, this ratiometric nucleobase analog enables real&#8208;time, multiparametric monitoring of i&#8208;motif folding with high sensitivity, and holds promise for extension to other noncanonical DNA structures. The findings further establish the 3&#8208;hydroxychromone platform as a powerful tool for the rational design of fluorescent sensors targeting dynamic nucleic acid architectures.

         <title>5&#8208;Thiohistidine N&#8208;Acetyltransferase from Proteiniphilum Saccharofermentans</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteiniphilum saccharofermentans, a Gram&#8208;negative facultative anaerobe, produces an N&#8208;acetyl transferase (5THNAT) that acetylates 5&#8208;thiohistidine using acetyl&#8208;CoA. This reaction competes with OvoC&#8208;mediated N&#960;&#8208;methylation of the same substrate. The production ratio of ovothiol to N&#945;&#8208;acetyl 5&#8208;thiohistidine is likely regulated by the relative availability of SAM and acetyl&#8208;CoA.

Ovothiol A is a 5&#8208;thiohistidine derivative biosynthesized by a broad range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Its redox&#8208;active mercaptoimidazole side chain is believed to protect cells from oxidative stress. The three enzymes that produce ovothiol A from histidine, cysteine, and S&#8208;adenosyl methionine have been identified and characterized. In contrast, no enzymes are known that produce other 5&#8208;thiohistidine derivatives. Here, a small family of acetyl&#8208;coenzyme A&#8208;dependent transferases is described that produce N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;5&#8208;thiohistidine. The discovery of these enzymes from Proteiniphilum saccharofermentans and related Bacteroidota provides evidence that the 5&#8208;thiohistidine class may be structurally and functionally more diverse than previously thought.

         <title>A Selenylation&#8208;Isocyanation&#8208;Amine Addition Strategy Targeting Prenylated Derivatives to Disrupt Oncogenic Rat Sarcoma Level</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein prenylation has gained significant interest recently due to its important role in cellular signaling pathways. Herein, we introduce our innovative strategy for selenylation&#8208;isocyanation, which targets prenyl functionalities in the first step. We then employ a range of amine&#8208;functionalized probes, including fluorescent, biotinylated, and other probes, allowing for fluorescent labeling, chemical pulldowns, and regulation of prenylated biomolecules (termed SIA&#8208;Tag).

In recent years, significant strides have been made in protein prenylation research, a critical post&#8208;translational modification essential for modulating cellular signaling. Central to this advancement is the selenylation&#8208;isocyanation&#8208;amine Addition strategy, which employs amine&#8208;functionalized fluorescent or biotin&#8208;tagged probes to selectively label or isolate prenylated molecules. Herein, Rat Sarcoma (RAS) protein regulation in HCT116 cell lines through the development of a novel prenylation labeling method is investigated. This approach provides insights into the functional dynamics of prenylated proteins and enables targeted manipulation of these molecules. While this work primarily establishes a methodological advance, it lays the foundation for future studies to elucidate RAS&#8208;related oncogenic signaling pathways and explore therapeutic strategies targeting prenylation&#8208;dependent processes.

         <title>Functionalizing Injectable Hydrogels with Cobalt&#8208;Based Metallacarboranes for Targeted Delivery in Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a biocompatible HA&#8211;lysine hydrogel loaded with cobalt metallacarborane (CoSAN) for targeted release into triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cells. The system maintains CoSAN cytotoxicity, as confirmed by cell assays and imaging, representing an attractive approach toward a localised TNBC treatment.

Cobalt&#8208;based metallacarboranes have emerged as potential candidates for cancer treatment owing to their unique structural properties. In this study, a biocompatible delivery platform is developed by noncovalently incorporating cobalt metallacarborane (CoSAN) into hyaluronic acid (HA) functionalized with lysine (Lys). HA&#8208;Lys 2 enables the electrostatic interaction of CoSAN while retaining its cytotoxic activity, as confirmed by cellular assays using MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cells. Elemental mapping via energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the successful and homogeneous incorporation of CoSAN to lead HA&#8208;Lys&#8208;CoSAN 3, and the composite is further characterized using diffusion&#8208;ordered nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (DOSY). Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy data demonstrate comparable cellular uptake in MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells of free and HA&#8208;loaded CoSAN. Additionally, release studies under physiologically relevant conditions show a sustained release profile over 24&#8201;h with pH dependency to mimic normal and tumor microenvironments. The present study describes a viable method for integrating metallacarboranes into a polymeric drug delivery system without compromising their anticancer properties, thereby advancing their potential for future therapeutic use.

         <title>Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Delivery of siRNA by Amphiphilic Nanovectors Self&#8208;Assembled from a Cationic [4]Helicene&#8208;Squalene Ester</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small amphiphilic helicene effectively complexes siRNA, leading to nanoassemblies which transport siRNA to the mitochondria where it silences the protein expression of the mitochondria&#8208;encoded cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene. 

The active delivery of therapeutic nucleic acids with subcellular precision is an open challenge. Herein, a small conjugate molecule, combining a cationic [4]helicene moiety with a lipophilic squalene tail, yields amphiphilic nanoassemblies capable of effectively complexing siRNA within the mitochondria. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept in HCT 116 colorectal cancer cells was evidenced by Western blot for the delivery of siRNA silencing the protein expression of the mitochondria&#8208;encoded cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene.

         <title>ThiF&#8208;Like Enzyme Chemistry in Primary and Secondary Metabolism</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ThiF&#8208;like enzymes are a widespread protein family found in disparate biosynthetic pathways. They are unified by their use of an NTP to modify a carboxylate, generating an activated species prone to nucleophilic addition. This common intermediate is then targeted by diverse nucleophiles, including persulfide or amino acid side chains, to yield a variety of structural scaffolds. This review highlights the diversity of chemical modifications made by the ThiF&#8208;like enzyme family, ranging from its involvement in the biosynthesis of universal enzyme cofactors to the formation of exotic bioactive RiPP natural product scaffolds.

ThiF&#8208;like proteins are members of the widespread E1&#8208;like enzyme superfamily. The eponymous ThiF enzyme was first described in thiamin biosynthesis as part of Escherichia coli's primary metabolism, and homologous proteins have been subsequently discovered in secondary metabolism. These ThiF&#8208;like enzymes are united in their defining ability to perform nucleotidylation of a carboxyl group to generate an activated, electrophilic intermediate, a feature it shares with the structurally related ubiquitin&#8208;activating enzymes. From here, an array of different nucleophiles are used across distinct biosynthetic pathways to yield diverse structural scaffolds. In this review, we discuss various ThiF&#8208;like enzymes that perform nucleotidylation to facilitate a diverse array of interesting and rare chemistry on different types of substrates, as well as showcase some of the shared structural features.

         <title>Reaction Engineering of In Vitro Natural Product Biosynthesis: Challenges and Strategies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The yield and turnover of in vitro natural product biosynthesis, and even its feasibility, are determined by intermolecular interactions. Reaction engineering allows to improve the performance of such complex biocatalytic systems.

Natural products are widely used as pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, or as active ingredients in food and cosmetics. Their biosynthesis typically involves a series of enzyme&#8208;controlled reactions in dedicated liquid environments. The reconstruction of these multistep transformations under in vitro conditions bears significant potential for technical utilization. However, the concurrent operation of multiple enzymes in a single reaction flask or reactor is often associated with major challenges. Herein, the difficulties in reaching high substrate conversion and product yields with in vitro enzyme cascades are summarized. Furthermore, both established and emerging concepts for improving their performance are discussed.

         <title>Glycosaminoglycans as Polyelectrolytes: Charge, Interactions, and Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linear, anionic biopolymers with their functions tightly linked to their charge. This review approaches GAGs from a polyelectrolyte perspective, shedding light on how the distribution of sulfate groups and, thus, negative charges, governs their interactions with other biomolecules. Understanding these charge&#8208;driven principles enables their understanding, analysis, and the design of GAG&#8208;based or GAG&#8208;mimetic materials.

Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linear, negatively charged biopolymers that modulate complex biological processes, such as blood coagulation, immune regulation, or viral entry. Their sulfation pattern and chain length govern how strongly they bind to other physiologically relevant species. Most of these interactions rely on electrostatic forces facilitated by the strong polyanionic properties of GAGs; therefore, considering these from a polyelectrolyte vantage point can help understand how such charge&#8208;based, often transient interactions contribute to physiological and pathological processes. While the different GAG classes share key electrostatic properties, they exhibit unique structural features that shape their function. Here, it is highlighted on how modern separation and analytical tools exploit the polyanionic character of GAGs to dissect subtle structural details. For these, the fundamental description of their charge&#8211;charge interactions is crucial. With this knowledge, modified GAGs, synthetic GAG mimetics, or GAG&#8208;binding molecules can be designed that replicate or refine their key properties and show promise for therapeutic and biomedical applications. Altogether, recognizing the importance of GAGs as polyelectrolytes provides vital knowledge on how their charge distribution mediates crucial biomolecular interactions in health and disease, and thus it helps complete our knowledge on fundamentally important biopolymers.

         <title>Recent Advances in P450 Enzyme Engineering for the Production of Natural Products</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept focuses on the advances in natural product synthesis using P450s, covering the applied strategies through cofactor engineering, redox partner engineering, and enzyme engineering, along with recent applications. It also outlines current technical bottlenecks and future development directions.

Natural products exhibit a wide range of biological activities and are the crucial resources for drug development and compound modification. Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s, CYP) are a class of multifunctional and stereoselective biocatalysts that utilize heme as a cofactor and can be employed in the biosynthesis of natural products. With the development of biotechnology, P450s have been widely applied in the synthesis of natural products. However, several challenges still exist during the catalytic process, including the difficulties in the soluble expression of P450s, the insufficient supply of cofactor heme, the limited substrate selectivity, and the low efficiency of electron transfer. This concept systematically summarizes recent advances in P450 enzyme engineering for the synthesis of natural products. It covers the engineering strategies to improve heme supply and enhance the catalytic efficiency for various P450 enzymes and their applications in synthesizing steroids, flavonoids, alkaloids, and terpenoids. This concept provides a foundation for overcoming catalytic bottlenecks and promoting the green biomanufacturing of high&#8208;value natural products.

         <title>Oleanolic Acid Amide Derivatives as 20s Proteasome Stimulators</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteasome stimulation is of high interest for its applications in clearing protein accumulation. This study investigates oleanolic acid, a pentacyclic triterpenoid natural product proteasome stimulator, through a structure&#8211;activity relationship campaign. These findings suggest that para&#8208;substituted benzyl amides and isopropyl amides at C28 increase proteasome stimulation.

Oleanolic acid (OA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid natural product, is previously identified as a proteasome stimulator using purified proteasome. Structure&#8211;activity relationship studies are carried out on OA at the C28 and C3 positions to determine if modifications at these positions can change proteasome stimulation activity. Ten amide derivatives are synthesized and tested in cells. These findings indicate that replacing the carboxylic acid with an amide at position C28 does not diminish the stimulating effect, with certain functional groups making stimulation more potent. Amides with increased steric hinderance stimulate the proteasome the best, particularly amides with ortho substituted benzyl or isopropyl moieties. OA is further derivatized at the C3 position by acylating the hydroxyl group. Changes at this position affect solubility of the derivatives, but do not dramatically diminish proteasome stimulation. These modifications highlight that the structure of OA can be modified to include linkers or covalent cross&#8208;linking moieties to expand upon the available proteasome probes.

         <title>Design and Characterization of the Fusion Enzyme of Bovine Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase and DNA Binding Protein Sso7d from Sulfolobus solfataricus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fusion of the DNA&#8208;binding protein Sso7d from Sulfolobus solfataricus with bovine DNA exotransferase results in a threefold increase in DNA&#8208;binding affinity to double&#8208;stranded DNA, enhances expression yield, and improves thermostability, along with altering functional activity. The obtained fusion enzymes serve as promising candidates for novel applications, including gene editing, mutagenesis studies, and aptamer engineering.

The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase is a unique polymerase that incorporates nucleotides at the 3&#8242;&#8208;terminus of single&#8208;stranded DNA primers in a template&#8208;independent manner. This biological function propels the development of numerous biomedical and bioengineering applications. However, the extensive use of TdT is constrained by its low expression levels in E. coli and low optimal operating temperature. To address these limitations, a fusion enzyme combining TdT and the DNA&#8208;binding protein Sso7d from Sulfolobus solfataricus is designed and isolated. This fusion protein exhibits a threefold increase in DNA&#8208;binding affinity to double&#8208;stranded DNA and demonstrates improved thermostability, denaturing at temperatures up to 48&#8201;&#176;C, along with an enhancement in the expression yield of the target protein. The fusion of Sso7d to the C&#8208;terminus of TdT enhances catalytic activity for nucleotide removal from the coding end, while completely abolishing nucleotide addition activity. Conversely, the presence of Sso7d at the N&#8208;terminus of TdT decreases nucleotide incorporation and enhances nucleotide removal activity, with this effect significantly influenced by substrate length and the presence of metal ions in the reaction mixture.

     alt="Design and Characterization of the Fusion Enzyme of Bovine Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase and DNA Binding Protein Sso7d from Sulfolobus solfataricus"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fusion of the DNA-binding protein Sso7d from &lt;i&gt;Sulfolobus solfataricus&lt;/i&gt; with bovine DNA exotransferase results in a threefold increase in DNA-binding affinity to double-stranded DNA, enhances expression yield, and improves thermostability, along with altering functional activity. The obtained fusion enzymes serve as promising candidates for novel applications, including gene editing, mutagenesis studies, and aptamer engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase is a unique polymerase that incorporates nucleotides at the 3&#8242;-terminus of single-stranded DNA primers in a template-independent manner. This biological function propels the development of numerous biomedical and bioengineering applications. However, the extensive use of TdT is constrained by its low expression levels in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; and low optimal operating temperature. To address these limitations, a fusion enzyme combining TdT and the DNA-binding protein Sso7d from &lt;i&gt;Sulfolobus solfataricus&lt;/i&gt; is designed and isolated. This fusion protein exhibits a threefold increase in DNA-binding affinity to double-stranded DNA and demonstrates improved thermostability, denaturing at temperatures up to 48&#8201;&#176;C, along with an enhancement in the expression yield of the target protein. The fusion of Sso7d to the C-terminus of TdT enhances catalytic activity for nucleotide removal from the coding end, while completely abolishing nucleotide addition activity. Conversely, the presence of Sso7d at the N-terminus of TdT decreases nucleotide incorporation and enhances nucleotide removal activity, with this effect significantly influenced by substrate length and the presence of metal ions in the reaction mixture. Overall, the obtained fusion enzymes could serve as promising candidates for novel specific applications, such as gene editing, mutagenesis studies, and aptamer engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Nucleotide&#8208;Derived Fluorophore for Visualizing G&#8208;Quadruplex Assembly and Introduction of Cation&#8208;Regulated Activity into the Thrombin Binding Aptamer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial analog of nucleotides, 7,8&#8208;dihydro&#8208;8&#8208;oxo&#8208;1, N6&#8208;ethenoadenine, increases aptamer affinity, introduces cation regulation of affinity, and traces aptamer structure folding.

Nucleic acid aptamers are artificial recognition elements with great potential in biotechnology. For their effective integration into nanodevices, rational strategies for optimizing aptamer affinity and regulating activity are essential. Artificial nucleotide analogs offer versatile tools for both fundamental and applied research in the aptamer field. Herein, the affinity of a thrombin&#8208;binding aptamer is increased tenfold through a single nucleotide modification with 7,8&#8208;dihydro&#8208;8&#8208;oxo&#8208;1, N6&#8208;ethenoadenine (oxo&#8208;&#949;A) introduced at either the 4th or 13th position. Normally, thymines in these positions form a T:T base pair, which is broken during the thrombin binding. A double oxo&#8208;&#949;A modification at both the 4th and 13th positions resulted in Ag+&#8208;dependence of aptamer activity. Ag+ ions formed a noncanonical oxo&#8208;&#949;A:Ag+2:oxo&#8208;&#949;A pair, mimicking the T:T pair found in the unmodified aptamer, which is a crucial part of the thrombin recognition interface. The intrinsic fluorescence of oxo&#8208;&#949;A is used to investigate conformational rearrangements in the loops during G&#8208;quadruplex (GQ) folding. The rapid kinetics of aptamer folding are captured using a stopped&#8208;flow fluorimeter. The dissociation constants are estimated for the aptamer complexes with K+, Na+, and Ag+, revealing the tiny influence of the modifications on GQ&#160;folding.

         <title>Indomethacin&#8208;Naphthalimide&#8208;Based AIEgen for Illuminating Golgi Apparatus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small molecule library is designed and synthesized for showing aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), among which one small molecule consisting of indomethacin, napthalimide&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl aniline, and amide linkage is identified to illuminate Golgi apparatus in cells. Quantum mechanical calculations, electron microscopy, and light scattering confirm the self&#8208;assembly of this novel molecule into nanoscale material.

Golgi apparatus (GA) is a complex organelle controlling subcellular protein modifications, sorting, and transport. Dysregulation in GA leads to cancer development and metastasis. Consequently, development of small molecule fluorophores for illuminating GA in cancer cells remains a major challenge. To address this, herein, a small molecule library of four aggregation&#8208;induced emissive probes (AIEgens) is designed and synthesized, having (a) indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug (NSAID) for GA homing; (b) 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted aniline as AIE inducer; and (c) amide/ester linkage between NSAID and AIE inducer. All the library members exhibited excellent AIE property in THF/water binary solvent systems through self&#8208;assembly in water. Interestingly, one of the library members (compound 13), consisting of napthalimide&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl aniline as AIE inducer and amide linkage, efficiently homes into the GA of HCT&#8208;116 colon cancer cells within 30&#8201;min and self&#8208;assembled into 2D nanoscale materials, as shown by scanning electron and atomic force microscopy and confirmed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Moreover, quantum mechanical calculations revealed intramolecular charge transfer (CT) between N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl aniline (donor) and naphthalimide (acceptor) as the underlying mechanism of the photophysical properties of compound 13. This novel AIEgen can serve as a chemical biology tool to visualize GA in cancer cells for next&#8208;generation cancer therapeutics.

         <title>The Linear Arginoketides Neotetrafibricin A, B, and C have Algicidal and Signal Function in Microbial Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study highlights the effect of the linear arginoketides neotetrafibricins on microorganisms. Structure&#8211;activity relationship analyses revealed that structural elements as the sugar moiety are not essential and presence of a guanidino or an amino group are interchangeable for bioactivity because the neotetrafibricin congeners described exhibited similar algicidal activity and signaling function towards a filamentous fungus.

Soils harbor some of the most diverse microbiomes on Earth. Interactions within these microbial communities are often mediated by natural products, many functioning as chemical signals. Specialized metabolites known as arginoketides, or arginine&#8208;derived polyketides, have been linked to mediate these interactions. However, the effect of linear arginoketides on soil microalgae has not yet been investigated. Here, we report that Streptomyces mashuensis DSM40221 produces the linear arginoketide neotetrafibricin A, and show that it exhibits algicidal activity against the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and induces production of orsellinic acid and derivatives encoded by the silent ors biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans. Thus, neotetrafibricin serves as an inter&#8208;kingdom signaling molecule. Genome mining identified the neotetrafibricin BGC in S. mashuensis. Disrupting the first polyketide synthase gene abolished neotetrafibricin production. Further mutational studies identified two neotetrafibricin congeners, including the novel neotetrafibricin C, which contains a terminal guanidino group. Structure&#8211;activity relationship analyses revealed that neither the terminal amino group nor the sugar moiety is essential for its algicidal activity or the induction of the ors BGC in the fungus. These findings expand the understanding of linear arginoketides in microbial ecology and highlight their potential as multifunctional signaling compounds in soil environments.

         <title>Screening the Irish Marine Biorepository Identifies a New Bryostatin Analog as Potent Inhibitor of Activated B&#8208;Cells Diffuse Large B&#8208;Cell Lymphoma</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>

Bryostatin analogs are found to be accumulated in the nudibranch Antiopella cristata collected in Irish waters. These are found to be potent inhibitors of activated B&#8208;cells diffuse large B&#8208;cell lymphoma.

Activated B&#8208;cell diffuse large B&#8208;cell lymphoma (ABC&#8208;DLBCL) is an aggressive cancer with poor response to standard chemotherapy. In search of new therapeutic leads, a library of 435 fractions prepared from the Irish marine biorepository was screened against 2 ABC&#8208;DLBCL cell lines (TMD8 and OCI&#8208;Ly10) and a non&#8208;cancerous control cell line (CB33). Active fractions are prioritized based on potency and selectivity. Among them, fractions from the nudibranch Antiopella cristata and the ascidian Diplosoma listerianum exhibit the most potent and selective cytotoxicity. Bioassay&#8208;guided fractionation of D. listerianum led to the identification of the known loliolide and epiloliolide. On the other hand, A. cristata yielded several bryostatin analogs, including bryostatin 13 and a new natural product, its 18&#8208;demethylated analog. Both compounds demonstrated nanomolar cytotoxicity against ABC&#8208;DLBCL cell lines with minimal activity in CB33. Transcriptomic profiling showed significant gene expression changes, particularly for the 18&#8208;demethylated analog, implicating modulation of key signaling pathways. This study identifies A. cristata as a novel and highly enriched source of bioactive bryostatins and supports the dietary sequestration hypothesis in nudibranchs, highlighting the value of marine invertebrates as reservoirs of selective anticancer agents for drug discovery.

In search of new therapeutic leads, a library of 435 fractions prepared from the Irish marine biorepository was screened against 2 ABC-DLBCL cell lines (TMD8 and OCI&lt;b&gt;-&lt;/b&gt;Ly10) and a non-cancerous control cell line (CB33). Active fractions are prioritized based on potency and selectivity. Among them, fractions from the nudibranch &lt;i&gt;Antiopella cristata&lt;/i&gt; and the ascidian &lt;i&gt;Diplosoma listerianum&lt;/i&gt; exhibit the most potent and selective cytotoxicity. Bioassay-guided fractionation of &lt;i&gt;D. listerianum&lt;/i&gt; led to the identification of the known loliolide and epiloliolide. On the other hand, &lt;i&gt;A. cristata&lt;/i&gt; yielded several bryostatin analogs, including bryostatin 13 and a new natural product, its 18-demethylated analog. Both compounds demonstrated nanomolar cytotoxicity against ABC-DLBCL cell lines with minimal activity in CB33. Transcriptomic profiling showed significant gene expression changes, particularly for the 18-demethylated analog, implicating modulation of key signaling pathways. This study identifies &lt;i&gt;A. cristata&lt;/i&gt; as a novel and highly enriched source of bioactive bryostatins and supports the dietary sequestration hypothesis in nudibranchs, highlighting the value of marine invertebrates as reservoirs of selective anticancer agents for drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Homogeneous Electrochemical Enzyme&#8208;Linked Immunosorbent Assay Strategy Based On pH&#8208;Mediated Redox Potential Regulation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homogeneous electrochemical enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay platform is developed, which simplifies and accelerates signal acquisition in field settings. Target&#8208;induced pH change is carefully investigated. Highly sensitive, reproducible, and quantitative electrochemical detection is achieved with C&#8208;reactive protein as a model target.

Enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is widely recognized as the gold standard for protein detection. However, its reliance on expensive and bulky optical instruments limits its use in point&#8208;of&#8208;care and resource&#8208;limited settings. Electrochemical technique emerges as a promising alternative due to its low cost, portability, and simple instrumentation. However, conventional electrochemical methods often require complex surface modifications and suffer from variability between electrodes. To overcome these limitations, a novel homogeneous electrochemical ELISA platform has been developed, that simplifies and accelerates signal acquisition in field settings. This platform leverages pH changes caused by alkaline phosphatase&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of ATP, resulting in solution acidification. These pH variations are sensitively detected through shifts in the redox potential of methylene blue (MB), a proton&#8208;sensitive electrochemical probe. By quantitatively correlating the target protein concentration with MB redox potential shift, a sensitive, reproducible, and quantitative electrochemical detection of a model protein, C&#8208;reactive protein, is achieved. This versatile and cost&#8208;effective approach holds significant potential to expand the applicability of ELISA to point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics.

         <title>Effects on LuxR&#8208;Regulated Bioluminescence of Cyclodextrin&#8208;Acyl&#8208;L&#8208;Homoserine Lactone Hybrids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>

Cyclodextrin&#8208;N&#8208;acyl&#8208;L&#8208;Homoserine&#8208;Lactone conjugates are synthetized, purified and fully characterized. The study of modulation of LuxR&#8208;regulated bioluminescence production has demonstrated that one of the compounds exhibits not only the capacity to induce bioluminescence with an EC50 value of 64&#8201;&#181;M, but also the ability to reduce bioluminescence with an IC50 value of 10&#8211;20&#8201;&#181;M.

In this work, acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) are grafted, the most studied signaling molecules in many Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, onto cyclodextrins (CDs) by copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition &#8220;click&#8221; coupling between alkynyl&#8208;AHLs and 6&#8208;azido&#8208;CDs derived from &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;CD, native or methylated. Attaching biomolecules onto a CD scaffold is a known strategy to enhance their properties, but designing CD&#8208;AHL conjugates has never been reported. These molecules were fully characterized by NMR and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, and the study of their solubility and conformation reveals significant conformational changes due to the presence of the AHL appendage on the CD structure. One of the hybrids (per&#8208;AHL&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD, 9B) exhibits higher solubility in water than AHL and &#946;&#8208;CD alone. The new CD&#8208;AHLs conjugates are found to modulate bioluminescence in a quorum Sensing LuxR&#8208;regulated light&#8208;producing bacterial model, with significant variations depending on the structure. The per&#8208;AHL&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD, 9B, is found to be the most active compound in the series.

         <title>Mitochondrial ClpX Inhibition Induces Ferroptosis and Blocks Pancreatic Cancer Cell Proliferation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional inhibition of ClpXP induces mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately driving lethal lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Through ATPase&#8208;focused screening, we identified MSC1094308 as a hit compound for ClpX inhibition, recapitulating the effects of CLPX&#8208;knockdown by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis in PDAC cells.

The ATPase caseinolytic protease X (ClpX), forming the ClpXP complex with caseinolytic protease P (ClpP), is essential for mitochondrial protein homeostasis. While ClpP targeting is a recognized anticancer strategy, the role of ClpX in cancer remains underexplored. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), elevated CLPX expression correlates with poor prognosis, suggesting its oncogenic function. CLPX knockdown disrupts mitochondrial homeostasis, and reduces oxidative phosphorylation, thus leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired PDAC cell proliferation. The ClpX&#8208;mediated mitochondrial dysfunction induces oxidative stress, unfolded protein response (UPR), and ferroptosis, which is evidenced by increased reactive oxygen species, ferrous iron, lipid peroxidation, and malondialdehyde levels. Screening ATPase inhibitors identifies MSC1094308 as a hit compound for ClpX inhibition, which suppresses ClpXP activity and induces UPR and ferroptosis in PDAC cells. These findings highlight ClpX inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy for PDAC.

         <title>A Photocaged N&#8208;Phosphonopiperidinone as a Selective Photo&#8208;Cleavable DPP8/9 Inhibitor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocaged inhibitors are versatile biochemical tools for spatiotemporal control of inhibitor activity, facilitating the elucidation of protein function in a cell type&#8208;dependent fashion. Herein, a green light&#8208;cleavable, BODIPY&#8208;photocaged dipeptidyl peptidase 8 and 9 inhibitor with low phototoxicity, pronounced potency, and selectivity is described, thereby demonstrating the benefits of chemical proteomics for inhibitor characterization.

The strategic introduction of photocages into chemical probes represents a powerful approach to generate spatiotemporally controlled tools with promising applications in chemical biology and drug discovery. This approach is particularly useful for inhibitors of proteins with cell&#8208;type&#8208;dependent functions, as they enable, via light&#8208;triggered selection, the study of their function in selected cells within multicellular organisms. The intracellular dipeptidyl peptidases 8 and 9 (DPP8/9) are serine hydrolases that act in a cell type&#8208;dependent fashion, in diverse biological processes such as inflammation and tumorigenesis. So far, no photocaged inhibitors for DPP8/9 are available, thus hampering their systematic investigations in biomedical research model systems such as mice. Herein, the development of a green light&#8208;cleavable, BODIPY&#8208;photocaged N&#8208;phosphono&#8208;piperidone&#8208;based DPP8/9 inhibitor is presented. This covalent&#8208;acting inhibitor is characterized by its photolysis properties, including a demonstration of its low phototoxicity, as well as potency and selectivity, in biochemical, biological, and, as an extension to these traditional validation approaches, chemical proteomics assays. These studies not only reveal the suitability of the developed photocages for cellular applications, as a prerequisite for their application in multicellular organisms, but also highlight the benefit of chemical proteomics workflows such as activity&#8208;based protein profiling for characterizing proteome&#8208;wide potencies and selectivities of photocaged compounds.

         <title>Characterization of an Extradiol Dioxygenase Using Integrating Cavity Spectrophotometry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating cavity spectrophotometry enables the direct and efficient characterization of an extradiol dioxygenase using a whole cell&#8208;based assay. This approach obviates the need for protein purification and provides more information about enzyme behavior inside of the cellular environment. Kinetic assays were leveraged for the design of preparative&#8208;scale reactions for biocatalytic synthesis of ring&#8208;cleaved molecules in high yield. 

The development of synthetically&#8208;useful biocatalysts requires characterizing the behavior of an enzyme under conditions amenable to preparative&#8208;scale reactions. Whole cells harboring the catalyst of interest are often used in such reactions, as protein purification is laborious and expensive. However, monitoring reaction rates when using whole cells is challenging, as cellular debris precludes the use of a continuous assay. Herein, we describe an approach to continuous monitoring of whole cell reactions that is enabled by the use of an integrating cavity spectrophotometer. This approach was used to directly profile the kinetic behavior of a previously uncharacterized extradiol dioxygenase DfdB from Rhodococcus sp. YK2. Data obtained from these experiments were compared with traditional in vitro assays. In both whole cell and purified enzyme kinetic assays, similar enzymatic behaviors were observed, including substrate inhibition. Measured KM values and observed trends in catalytic efficiency were comparable for both types of enzyme preparation. Information provided by this analysis was leveraged to optimize preparative&#8208;scale whole cell reactions with DfdB, enabling the synthesis of two DfdB products in high yield. Importantly, this work showcases the potential for ICS&#8208;based methods to rapidly evaluate kinetic trends on analytical scale and thereby enables efficient reaction optimization for preparative&#8208;scale synthesis.

         <title>Enantiocomplementary Bioreduction of Flexible Ring N&#8208;(3&#8208;Oxobutyl)Heterocycles Providing Enantiopure Chiral Fragments for Drug Discovery</title>

Bioreduction of flexible ring N&#8208;(3&#8208;oxobutyl)&#8208;heterocycles mediated by enantiocomplementary recombinant alcohol dehydrogenases [an (S)&#8208;selective one from Rhodococcus aetherivorans (RaADH), and an (R)&#8208;selective one from Lactobacillus kefir (LkADH)], as whole&#8208;cell biocatalysts results in enantiopure (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;alcohols (ee &gt; 99%), which are promising chiral fragments with a high degree of drug&#8208;likeness for drug discovery.

In this study, the bioreduction of prochiral N&#8208;(3&#8208;oxobutyl)heterocycles comprising various (partially) saturated, flexible rings is explored using microbial whole&#8208;cell ketoreductases such as wild&#8208;type yeast strains including baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and Escherichia coli cells expressing two enantiocomplementary recombinant alcohol dehydrogenases. Initially, four wild&#8208;type yeast strains are screened for ketoreductase activity on a series of nine flexible N&#8208;heterocycles with prochiral carbonyl group in the N&#8208;(3&#8208;oxobutyl) sidechain. The yeast strains resulted in the corresponding (S)&#8208;alcohols with a low to moderate conversions. Using recombinant alcohol dehydrogenase whole&#8208;cell preparations as biocatalysts ((S)&#8208;selective ADH from Rhodococcus aetherivorans (RaADH) and (R)&#8208;selective ADH from Lactobacillus kefir (LkADH)) resulted in higher conversions in most cases, while maintaining the full enantiotopic selectivity. Usually, the preparative&#8208;scale bioreductions showed comparable or even higher conversions than those observed in the small&#8208;scale screening reactions, resulting in virtually enantiopure (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;alcohols (ee&#8201;&gt;&#8201;99%), which are promising chiral fragments with a high degree of drug&#8208;likeness. Docking studies confirmed the absolute configuration of the forming (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;alcohols.

         <title>AtGH3.10 and JAR1 Produce 12&#8208;Hydroxyjasmonoyl&#8208;l&#8208;isoleucine from 12&#8208;Hydroxyjasmonic Acid in Arabidopsis thaliana</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
12&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;7&#8208;iso&#8208;jasmonic acid (12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA) is converted to an active jasmonate 12&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;7&#8208;iso&#8208;jasmonoyl&#8208;l&#8208;isoleucine (12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA&#8208;Ile) in Arabidopsis. Enzyme assays with recombinant enzymes and mutant analysis reveal that JAR1 and AtGH3.10 conjugate l&#8208;isoleucine to 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA. Higher catalytic efficiency is observed with 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA for AtGH3.10 than for JAR1.

Jasmonates are plant hormones that regulate plant defense and development. 7&#8208;iso&#8208;Jasmonoyl&#8208;l&#8208;isoleucine (JA&#8208;Ile) is a representative active jasmonate which is biosynthesized from 7&#8208;iso&#8208;jasmonic acid (JA) by the jasmonoyl&#8208;amido synthases JASMONATE RESISTANT 1 (JAR1) and AtGH3.10 in Arabidopsis thaliana. 12&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;7&#8208;iso&#8208;jasmonoyl&#8208;l&#8208;isoleucine (12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA&#8208;Ile) is another active jasmonate, and 12&#8208;hydroxylation of JA&#8208;Ile is considered the major biosynthetic pathway toward 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA&#8208;Ile. Previous report elucidated that recombinant JAR1 showed a weak activity against 12&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;7&#8208;iso&#8208;jasmonic acid (12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA). However, the direct conversion from 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA to 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA&#8208;Ile in planta and the enzyme activity of AtG3.10 against 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA have never been reported. Herein, a feeding experiment with deuterated 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA confirms the direct conversion of 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA to 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA&#8208;Ile in wild&#8208;type Arabidopsis plants. The conversion from 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA to 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA&#8208;Ile is not observed in jar1 gh3.10 double mutant, suggesting that 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA is converted to 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA&#8208;Ile by JAR1 and AtGH3.10. Notably, enzyme assays show that the catalytic efficiency with 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA for AtGH3.10 is higher than those with JA for AtGH3.10 and with 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA for JAR1. Comparative analysis of JAR1 and AtGH3.10 structures and site&#8208;directed mutation analysis reveals that Ser120 in AtGH3.10 is the key amino acid residue responsible for its high catalytic efficiency against 12&#8208;OH&#8208;JA.

         <title>Characterization of the N&#8208;Hydroxylating Monooxygenase TheA from Thermocrispum agreste Reveals a Broad Substrate Spectrum</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
TheA is a moderate thermostable flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase which accepts, besides l&#8208;ornithine a number of related molecules for the regio&#8208;selective N&#8208;hydroxylation. The combination with a NADP+&#8208;reducing formate dehydrogenase variant (FDH M4) and a H2O2 degrading catalase allows in vitro biocatalytic applications.

The N&#8208;hydroxylating monooxygenase (NMO) TheA from Thermocrispum agreste catalyzes the N&#8208;hydroxylation step of l&#8208;ornithine, which is the first step in the thermochelin siderophore biosynthesis. Characterization of this enzyme revealed a significant thermostability up to 50&#8201;&#176;C and activity with the non&#8208;native substrate d&#8208;ornithine with kinetic parameters (Km&#8201;=&#8201;4.06&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.31&#8201;mM, kcat&#8201;=&#8201;0.057&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.001 s&#8722;1, and kcat/Km&#8201;=&#8201;0.007&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;mM&#8722;1) and a coupling rate of 81%. The enzyme is applied in a one&#8208;pot reaction with a formate dehydrogenase variant for NADPH regeneration and catalase for H2O2 detoxification. Optimization of the reaction conditions resulted in activity with various non&#8208;native substrates such as d&#8208;ornithine, l&#8208;lysine, S&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl)&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine, and l&#8208;arginine. Products are confirmed through LC&#8208;MS/MS, and mutagenesis experiments gave insight on the potentially underlying mechanisms. This work identifies a thermotolerant NMO that is suitable for application and as a starting point for enzyme engineering.

&lt;p&gt;TheA is a moderate thermostable flavin-dependent monooxygenase which accepts, besides &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-ornithine a number of related molecules for the regio-selective &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxylation. The combination with a NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-reducing formate dehydrogenase variant (FDH M4) and a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; degrading catalase allows in vitro biocatalytic applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxylating monooxygenase (NMO) TheA from &lt;i&gt;Thermocrispum agreste&lt;/i&gt; catalyzes the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxylation step of &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-ornithine, which is the first step in the thermochelin siderophore biosynthesis. Characterization of this enzyme revealed a significant thermostability up to 50&#8201;&#176;C and activity with the non-native substrate &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-ornithine with kinetic parameters (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;=&#8201;4.06&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.31&#8201;mM, &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;=&#8201;0.057&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.001 s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;=&#8201;0.007&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&#8201;&lt;/sup&gt;mM&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and a coupling rate of 81%. The enzyme is applied in a one-pot reaction with a formate dehydrogenase variant for NADPH regeneration and catalase for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; detoxification. Optimization of the reaction conditions resulted in activity with various non-native substrates such as &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-ornithine, &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-lysine, S-(2-aminoethyl)-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-cysteine, and &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-arginine. Products are confirmed through LC-MS/MS, and mutagenesis experiments gave insight on the potentially underlying mechanisms. This work identifies a thermotolerant NMO that is suitable for application and as a starting point for enzyme engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cooperative Enhancement of Aldoxime Dehydratase Stability through Whole&#8208;Cell Immobilization and Flow Reactor Integration</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a synergistic approach to enhance the stability of the engineered aldoxime dehydratase OxdF1 (L318F/F306Y) by combining whole&#8208;cell immobilization in Ba&#8208;alginate with continuous flow processing. Applied to challenging substrates, like 2,6&#8208;difluorobenzaldoxime, the system enables efficient, stable nitrile synthesis with in&#8208;line product extraction and improved sustainability.

This study investigates the synthesis of aromatic nitriles using an evolved variant of OxdF1 (L318F/F306Y), an aldoxime dehydratase from Pseudomonas putida F1, engineered for improved catalytic efficiency toward benzaldehyde oxime. The double OxdF1 (L318F/F306Y) mutant effectively catalyzes the conversion of various benzaldoxime derivatives to the corresponding nitriles. Due to the enzyme's inherent instability, immobilized whole&#8208;cell systems are employed in a flow reactor to improve its stability and broaden its applicability, with the biotransformation of benzaldehyde oxime and 2,6&#8208;difluorobenzaldehyde oxime serving as case studies. The enzyme's stability is markedly improved, maintaining 87% yield even after 8&#8201;h of processing in the preparation of benzonitrile. Preparation of 2,6&#8208;difluorobenzontirile poses additional challenges due to the low water solubility of both the substrate, and even more so, the product, an important intermediate in various chemical applications. To overcome solubility limitations, a segmented liquid&#8211;liquid flow system (water/cyclohexane) was implemented, significantly improving the enzyme stability. The process was run continuously for 12&#8201;h, with a conversion of &#8776;70% by the end of the operation. Furthermore, 2,6&#8208;difluorobenzonitrile is selectively extracted in&#8208;line using a liquid&#8211;liquid extractor, thus, facilitating its efficient recovery and purification.

         <title>Artificial Peptides as Autophagy Modulators</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Autophagy is a fundamental cellular process that eliminates molecules and subcellular elements. This process is crucial for maintaining homeostasis and responding to various stressors, playing a key role in physiological development and the genesis of pathological conditions. This review summarizes recent advances in autophagy regulation strategies and the development of artificial peptide&#8208;based tools for monitoring and modulating autophagy.

Autophagy is a highly conserved lysosomal degradation pathway for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Its dysregulation is implicated in various diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and infections, making precise modulation of autophagy a potentially promising therapeutic strategy. Artificial peptide&#8208;based autophagy modulators have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional small molecules, offering several advantages in terms of specificity, biocompatibility, and functional versatility. This review summarizes recent advances in artificial peptide&#8208;based autophagy monitoring tools, autophagy inducers, and autophagy inhibitors.

         <title>Quantitative Strategies for Decoding Organelle Ion Dynamics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights cutting&#8208;edge strategies for probing ion dynamics within organelles using fluorescent indicators. It discusses key advances in calibration techniques for absolute ion quantification and their impact on understanding organellar physiology, and concludes with future directions and applications in decoding ion&#8208;regulated processes in health and disease.

Ion dynamics within cellular organelles are fundamental to numerous biochemical processes, maintaining homeostasis and enabling critical cellular functions. Despite continuous ion movement across organelle membranes, stable ionic gradients are preserved, creating optimal microenvironments for organelle&#8208;specific activities such as ATP production in mitochondria, lysosomal degradation, Golgi&#8208;mediated protein modifications, and DNA processing in the nucleus. These gradients are regulated by specialized membrane proteins, including ion channels and transporters, which facilitate selective and controlled ion flux. Dysfunction in these regulatory proteins is linked to various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular conditions, immune dysfunctions, and cancers. Understanding ion regulation mechanisms at the molecular level is not only essential for basic cell biology but also crucial for revealing pathological pathways and identifying therapeutic targets. Recent technological advances&#8212;such as fluorescent probes based on green fluorescent protein, small molecules, and DNA nanodevices&#8212;have significantly enhanced our ability to study ion dynamics with high spatial and temporal resolution. These tools enable both qualitative and quantitative analyses, offering insights into ion transport mechanisms and their physiological relevance. A comprehensive overview of the principles underlying functional imaging of ion dynamics is provided, current challenges in quantitative assessment are highlighted, and future directions in organelle&#8208;specific ion regulation are discussed.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Photochemical Biology of Serotonin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The neurotransmitter serotonin influences a wide range of behaviors and biological processes through a series of serotonin receptors and transporters. Recent photochemical tools have made it possible to follow this complicated web of interactions with ever improving spatial and temporal resolution.

Serotonin (5&#8208;HT) is an endogenous neurotransmitter that plays a key role in cellular signaling. Its interactions with serotonin receptors (5&#8208;HTRs) and the serotonin transporter (SERT) influence processes as disparate as hunger, happiness, healing, and headaches. Over the last several decades, photochemical tools have been developed to observe, track, and modulate these serotonin&#8211;protein interactions. The tools tend to fit into one of four categories: photoswitches, photocages, photobiosensors, or photocross&#8208;linkers. This review examines the development and application of these photochemical tools for 5&#8208;HT, 5&#8208;HTRs, and SERT over the last &#8776;10&#8201;years, with an emphasis on the chemistry involved.

&lt;p&gt;The neurotransmitter serotonin influences a wide range of behaviors and biological processes through a series of serotonin receptors and transporters. Recent photochemical tools have made it possible to follow this complicated web of interactions with ever improving spatial and temporal resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serotonin (5-HT) is an endogenous neurotransmitter that plays a key role in cellular signaling. Its interactions with serotonin receptors (5-HTRs) and the serotonin transporter (SERT) influence processes as disparate as hunger, happiness, healing, and headaches. Over the last several decades, photochemical tools have been developed to observe, track, and modulate these serotonin&#8211;protein interactions. The tools tend to fit into one of four categories: photoswitches, photocages, photobiosensors, or photocross-linkers. This review examines the development and application of these photochemical tools for 5-HT, 5-HTRs, and SERT over the last &#8776;10&#8201;years, with an emphasis on the chemistry involved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Two&#8208;Color Timestamping of Gene Expression with a Chemigenetic Reporter System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 26, Issue 19, October 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemigenetic reporter assay is developed that enables monitoring of BiP/GRP78 expression, an important chaperone and key regulator of the unfolded protein response. The system is based on the coexpression of BiP/GRP78 and the self&#8208;labeling protein HaloTag. Using a two&#8208;color labeling strategy for improved readout sensitivity, the assay is applied in high&#8208;content screening for novel activators of BiP/GRP78 expression.

Stress response pathways rely on coordinated gene expression regulation. In the endoplasmic reticulum, the unfolded protein response plays an important role in maintaining the homeostasis of protein folding and processing. A chemigenetic reporter assay is developed that allows monitoring of BiP/GRP78 expression, a key regulator of the unfolded protein response. The system is based on the coexpression of the self&#8208;labeling protein HaloTag via an internal ribosome entry site. HaloTag allows for flexibility in labeling color as well as labeling timepoint. A two&#8208;color timestamping strategy is designed that provides improved readout sensitivity. The reporter system can be used in live&#8208;cell imaging as well as flow cytometry. It is applied in a high&#8208;content screening experiment in which a new promising activator of BiP/GRP78 expression was identified.

         <title>Advances and Challenges in Bioprocess Optimization for the Synthesis of Sugar Nucleotides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of flow biocatalysis for the production of glycan building blocks, sugar nucleotides, is considered.

Sugar nucleotides represent the cornerstone building blocks for glycan biosynthesis. While methods to access these crucial biomolecules using traditional batch synthetic chemistry and enzymatic approaches have blossomed, uptake using flow&#8208;based synthesis is burgeoning. This perspective analyzes recent advances concerning enzyme immobilization and continuous flow biocatalysis for sugar nucleotide production and usage. Evaluation of related technologies is also discussed, highlighting new enzyme immobilization approaches, novel reactor design, and improved downstream processing as areas that must evolve to enable wider, scalable access to sugar nucleotides as commodity chemicals.

Bioactivity Profiles of Progressively Ring&#8208;Fluorinated Cyclohexyl Motifs in the WKYMVm Peptide as Formylpeptide FPR2 Agonists and in Keto&#8208;Piperazines as Antitrypanosome Agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;cis&#8208;fluorinated cyclohexyl motifs with progressively increasing levels of fluorine are introduced into the WKYMVm peptide and a class of keto&#8208;piperazine derivatives and assayed against the FPR2 receptor or the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, respectively. Increasing fluorination, reduced Log P's, however it generally results in poorer bioactivities, indicating an inverse relationship between cyclohexane ring polarity and bioactivity in each case.

A series of all&#8208;cis&#8208;ring&#8208;fluorinated cyclohexylalanines with progressively increasing levels of vicinal fluorines, as well as 4&#8208;fluorophenylalanine and pentafluoroarylphenylalanine is introduced into the WKYMVm peptide in place of its tyrosine residue, for assays against the G&#8208;protein coupled formylpeptide receptor, FPR2. Selected all&#8208;cis&#8208;ring cyclohexylalanines of this class are also incorporated into a keto&#8208;piperazine molecular scaffold to generate sp3&#8208;rich derivatives for assays against the parasite Trypanosoma brucei. For these cyclohexylalanine analogs bioactivity trends correlate progressively with the levels of fluorination in each of the case studies. Notably, the all&#8208;cis pentafluorocyclohexylalanine analog of the W&#8208;peptide is least active perhaps correlating with the well&#8208;known polarity of this &#8216;Janus face&#8217; cyclohexane. Although the trend is also apparent in the anti&#8208;trypanosomal assays of the keto&#8208;piperazine derivatives, it is less so and some compounds are more active than the previously reported phenylalanine&#8208;derived analog.

         <title>From Molecule to Meaning: Click and Bioorthogonal Chemical Reporters for Plant Systems, Biological Imaging, and Artistic Expression</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
At the intersection of chemical biology, plant imaging, and contemporary art, this review introduces the concept of chembioart. By tracing how chemical reporters illuminate plant biomolecules in vivo, their role not only in advancing scientific understanding but also in inspiring transdisciplinary collaborations and visual expression&#160;is highlighted.

Chemical biology has reshaped the ability to investigate complex biological systems at the molecular level. In this context, chemical reporters have become important tools for labeling and tracking biomolecules in living systems with spatial and temporal precision. In plant biology, they provide an alternative to genetic approaches and allow the study of dynamic processes in species or organs that are not easily accessible. Through the use of click and bioorthogonal chemistry, small&#8208;molecule probes can be metabolically incorporated into specific molecular scaffolds such as sugars, monolignols, amino acids, and lipids. These probes make it possible to follow events like glycosylation, lignification, lipid turnover, or protein synthesis in living plant tissues. This review presents an overview of current chemical reporter strategies, from molecular design and synthetic considerations to their application in plant imaging. Herein, how these tools have contributed to the development of plant chemical biology by enabling precise and modular investigations of plant structure and metabolism is described. Herein, it is also examined how chemical reporters have entered interdisciplinary contexts, including collaborations between science and the arts. By converting molecular&#8208;level information into visual and sensory formats, these approaches open new perspectives for research, education, and communication across scientific and creative disciplines.

         <title>Recent Advances on Dehydroalanine&#8208;Specific Modification and Diversification of Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical modifications based on dehydroalanine (Dha) have attracted considerable attention in the field of peptide and protein functionalization due to their high efficiency and site selectivity. This review summarizes the latest progress on the Dha&#8208;specific modification and diversification of peptides and proteins, as well as their applications in chemical biology and drug discovery.

In recent years, chemical modification techniques based on dehydroalanine (Dha) have become a prominent area in the functionalization of peptides and proteins due to their high efficiency and site selectivity. This article reviews the recent advancements in the modification of Dha&#8208;containing peptides and proteins. Focusing on the chemical properties of Dha, the advantages of nucleophilic addition reactions, free radical chemistry, metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and cycloaddition reactions in peptide and protein modification are discussed, as well as their applicability in the development of novel biocompatible methods. Additionally, the article explores the current limitations of these techniques and highlights future challenges that need to be addressed.

Advances in Hydrocarbon Stapled Peptides via Ring&#8208;Closing Metathesis: Synthetic Strategies, Structural Diversity, and Therapeutic Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrocarbon stapled peptides, including single, multiple, and stitched stapling strategies, improve &#945;&#8208;helical conformation, enhance resistance to proteolytic degradation, and increase biological activity. These structural modifications significantly broaden the therapeutic potential of peptides across cancer, infectious diseases, and other biomedical applications.

Peptide stapling has emerged as a powerful strategy to stabilize &#945;&#8208;helical structures in peptides, thereby enhancing their proteolytic resistance, membrane permeability, and biological activity. Among the various stapling methodologies, hydrocarbon stapling via ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing metathesis remains the most widely adopted due to its robust chemical efficiency and synthetic compatibility with solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. This review summarizes key advancements in hydrocarbon stapling technologies, including mono&#8208; and multiple&#8208;stapling, solution&#8208; and solid&#8208;phase approaches, and newer developments such as stitched and aza&#8208;stapled peptides. The integration of rigidified anchoring residues (e.g., cyclobutane or carbocyclic &#945;, &#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acids) and orthogonal metathesis strategies has significantly expanded the structural diversity and functional potential of stapled peptides. Furthermore, novel bioorthogonal modifications and imaging capabilities, such as Raman&#8208;active diyne bridges, have opened new directions in therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Together, these innovations underscore the growing utility of stapled peptides in modulating protein&#8211;protein interactions and advancing peptide drug discovery.

         <title>Synthesis and Incorporation of a pH&#8208;Responsive Nucleoside Into DNA Sequences</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;responsive nucleoside is developed that enables a reversible switch in DNA between paired and unpaired states near physiological pH. This design may provide the framework for sequence&#8208;independent, pH programable DNA motifs, thus paving the way for dynamic DNA nanotechnology applications.

DNA's programable thermodynamics, structural versatility, and ease of synthesis makes it an ideal material for constructing molecular devices. While many biological systems are powered by proton gradients to drive dynamic processes, harnessing pH differences in DNA nanotechnology is possible through pH&#8208;responsive DNA motifs. Existing strategies, however, often depend on strict sequence constraints or nonphysiological pH conditions, limiting their applicability in complex DNA origami structures. In this article, a nucleoside with pH&#8208;sensitive base pairing is developed that reversibly switches its pairing specificity near physiological pH. This unnatural building block is recognized by standard polymerases, and its pairing behavior can be controlled by pH. Characterization of the base pairing properties reveals that duplex stability varies with pH, while canonical sequences remain unaffected. This design enables programable sequence motifs that transition between duplex and single&#8208;stranded DNA in response to pH changes. Our unnatural nucleoside therefore provides a versatile tool for dynamic DNA nanotechnology, with potential applications in DNA nanomachines, biosensing, and targeted drug delivery. Additionally, its physiological pKa may enable general acid&#8211;base catalysis in ribozymes or DNAzymes, analogous to histidine in protein enzymes.

         <title>A Conversational Large&#8208;Language&#8208;Model Tutor that Accelerates Machine&#8208;Learning Method Development in Routine Bioanalytical Workflows</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structured chatbot assistant supports machine learning model development in bioanalytical chemistry by guiding experimental scientists through each workflow stage using natural language. Built on a general&#8208;purpose large language model and prompt engineering, its structured design and full documentation offer a lightweight, adaptable workflow for creating domain&#8208;specific scientific assistants.

As machine learning (ML) becomes increasingly relevant in experimental chemistry, many scientists face barriers to adoption due to limited training in ML. While AutoML platforms offer powerful capabilities, they lack the instructional scaffolding needed by users without an ML background. To address this gap, a lightweight, conversational assistant is presented that guides users through ML workflow design using plain&#8208;language dialog. Powered by OpenAI's GPT&#8208;4o and deployed via a Gradio interface, the assistant operates under a structured system prompt that simulates pedagogical reasoning. It behaves like a domain&#8208;specific tutor: helping users define ML goals, assess data structure, select models, evaluate metrics, and generate annotated Python code. A complete documentation of the development process is provided, allowing researchers to adapt the system for other domains. Herein, its utility is demonstrated in two representative case studies: 1) image classification of lateral flow immunoassay test strips for diagnostic readout; and 2) regression&#8208;based prediction of liquid chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry retention times from molecular descriptors for small molecules. In both cases, lab members with no ML experience successfully developed working models guided solely by the assistant. By lowering the barrier to ML adoption in data&#8208;rich analytical workflows, this system offers a customizable workflow for building domain&#8208;specific assistants across experimental science.

         <title>Five&#8208;In&#8208;One Antibacterial Strategy: A Mn(I) Complex Lights Up the Fight Against Tuberculosis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;activated Mn(I) complex combats tuberculosis (TB) through a five&#8208;in&#8208;one antibacterial strategy, releasing carbon monoxide (CO), generating reactive oxygen species, disrupting membranes, forming catalytic manganese oxide (MnOx) species, and liberating a toxic ligand. This multifunctional approach offers a powerful new direction for treating drug&#8208;resistant TB infections.

Tuberculosis, which the WHO describes as the &#8220;world's top infectious killer,&#8221; demands novel combating strategies rather than conventional ones, as the situation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) resistance to therapeutic drugs is continuous, leading to millions of deaths each year. In a recent study, Lai et al. report a manganese(I)&#8208;based photoactivatable carbon monoxide&#8208;releasing molecule (Mn&#8208;PTP) that unifies photodynamic therapy, transition metal reactivity, and carbon monoxide (CO) delivery into a single light&#8208;activated therapeutic platform. Upon white&#8208;light irradiation, Mn&#8208;PTP releases CO, generates both type I and type II reactive oxygen species (ROS), liberates a toxic antibacterial ligand (PTP), and forms catalytically active manganese oxides (MnOx) species that decompose intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), thereby alleviating hypoxia and amplifying ROS&#160;generation. Mn&#8208;PTP demonstrates high selectivity for Mycobacterium smegmatis with, potent in&#8201;vitro antibacterial activity (MIC90&#8201;=&#8201;3.11&#8201;&#956;M), robust biofilm disruption of M. smegmatis, and minimal cytotoxicity to normal cells. In in&#8201;vivo, the compound significantly accelerates wound healing in infected mice, outperforming isoniazid. This highlight discusses Mn&#8208;PTP as a powerful &#8220;one&#8208;for&#8208;all&#8221; agent which, upon irradiation, releases five key components that, much like the five fingers through coordinated action, form a fist that effectively combats and eliminates bacterial infections, offering a powerful blueprint for next&#8208;generation metal&#8208;based therapeutics against persistent mycobacterial infections.

         <title>Cryo&#8208;EM Structures Reveal Nonmirror&#8208;Image Binding of L&#8208; and D&#8208;Peptide Enantiomers at &#945;7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In peptide medicinal chemistry, D&#8208;residues are commonly used to create inverso or retro&#8208;inverso analogs to enhance proteolytic stability and binding affinity of peptides. Here, we present Cryo&#8208;electron microscopy structures of L&#8208; and D&#8208;peptide enantiomers bound to human &#945;7&#8208;nAChR at atomic&#8208;resolution, unveiling a hybrid binding mode&#8212;featuring both chiral inversion and backbone flip&#8212;rather than simple mirror symmetry.

Peptides targeting the &#945;7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (&#945;7&#8208;nAChR) hold significant potential for biological research and therapeutic applications. Notably, linear D&#8208;amino acid peptides exhibit higher inhibitory potency against &#945;7&#8208;nAChR and greater proteolytic stability compared to their L&#8208;type counterparts, making them more attractive candidates for both laboratory research and clinical use. However, the molecular basis of D&#8208;peptide binding to &#945;7&#8208;nAChR remains elusive. Herein, cryo&#8208;EM structures of &#945;7&#8208;nAChR is presented in complex with the L&#8208;peptide LKP1794 (2.68&#8201;&#197;) and its D&#8208;peptide enantiomer DKP1794 (2.53&#8201;&#197;), providing the first molecular insights into D&#8208;peptide recognition by &#945;7&#8208;nAChR. Structural analysis reveals that both peptides occupy the orthosteric site of &#945;7&#8208;nAChR. However, their binding poses are not merely mirror images; instead, they adopt a hybrid binding mode that combines mirror symmetry with a flipped peptide backbone orientation. Our structural data uncover a distinct D&#8208;peptide binding mechanism that diverges from the hypothesized retro&#8208;inversion model.

         <title>Development and Validation of a High&#8208;Throughput Screening Assay for the Legionella ADP&#8208;Ribosyl Transferase SdeA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show the optimization and application of a fluorogenic assay to monitor Legionella SdeA activity in a High&#8208;Throughput&#8208;Screening campaign.

Ubiquitination of proteins is one of the most crucial post&#8208;translational modifications in eukaryotic cells, typically involving conjugation of ubiquitin to a lysine residue in a substrate using a three&#8208;enzyme cascade that relies on ATP as energy source. The pathogen Legionella pneumophila, in contrast, employs a totally divergent pathway to ubiquitinate cellular host proteins in an unconventional manner that is crucial for bacterial proliferation. This multistep process is orchestrated by effector proteins from the SidE family which initially use NAD+ to adenosine diphosphate (ADP)&#8208;ribosylate ubiquitin in a mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosyltransferase (mART) domain. The subsequent step relies on SidE phosphodiesterase activity to conjugate phosphoribosyl&#8208;Ubiquitin to serine residues in host substrates. Through these phosphoribosyl&#8208;ubiquitinating events, Legionella is able to gain local control over the host's ubiquitin system and simultaneously evades immune responses. Hence, pursuing new inhibitors which can disrupt these crucial steps in bacterial infection are essential towards further understanding and potentially blocking Legionella infection. Here, we present the application of an &#949;&#8208;NAD+ consumption&#8208;based fluorogenic assay to identify small molecule modulators of the SdeA effector enzyme in a High&#8208;Throughput Screening format, where over 600 compounds were screened. As a result, a potent inhibitor named cephalosporin C Zn2+ salt was discovered showing an IC50 of 221&#8201;nM. To investigate the inhibitory properties more deeply, various cephalosporin analogs were synthesized where variations in charge and carbon length were introduced and their inhibitory efficiencies measured and compared. Our findings suggest that the inhibition is primarily attributed to the presence of the Zn2+ ion, rather than the cephalosporin core. We next compared the inhibitory potential of other bivalent metal ions, illustrating that the zinc ion causes the best inhibition of the Legionella effector.

         <title>Identification of Methylglyoxal Reactive Proteins with Photocaged Glycating Agents</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocaged methylglyoxal (PC&#8208;MGO) derivatives enable studying protein glycation under mild conditions. The active glycating agents can be released in the protein solution by irradiating the sample with UV light. Compared to the earlier reported chemically activated MGO probes, the photocaged probes are more potent. The light triggered release of MGO probes will open opportunities to study glycation with a higher cellular precision.

Methylglyoxal is a highly reactive metabolite that is formed spontaneously in the glycolytic pathway. The side chains of various amino acid residues react with methylglyoxal to form advanced&#8208;glycation end products (AGEs). This enzyme&#8208;independent process introduces post&#8208;translational modifications onto the proteins and it is long thought that the resulting AGEs primarily inhibit proteins. More recent studies have shown that these AGEs can act in signaling and feedback loops and that a large number of proteins react reversibly with methylglyoxal. These findings lead to a renewed interest in methylglyoxal&#8208;induced AGEs and lead to the development of novel tools and methodologies that can be used to identify the modified proteins. Many of studies are nowadays still performed by adding methylglyoxal exogenously, often in a high concentration, despite the high reactivity of methylglyoxal. Herein, new photocaged&#8208;methylglyoxal derivatives are reported that allow the direct release of methylglyoxal in the sample of interest by irradiating the photocaged probe with UV light. It is shown that this labeling approach is more efficient. A far larger number of proteins are labeled with the photocaged probes than with the chemically activated probes. The here reported approach should allow studying in&#8201;situ glycation under physiological more relevant conditions.

         <title>Deserts, Rivers, Pools, and Billabongs: Water Features of the Nitrogenase Proteins, and their Functions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the protein surrounding the active site of nitrogenase there is a large anhydrous desert, traversed by two watercourses necessary for the enzyme to convert N2 to NH3. Various pools exist, but their water seems to be stagnant.

This review examines the occurrence and function of water inside the protein that contains the catalytic site of the enzyme nitrogenase. The requirement of 8 protons and 8 electrons to convert N2 to NH3 and the opposing acid&#8212;base character of reactant and product are unique in enzymology. The active site is an unprecedented iron sulfide cluster containing one heterometal, in Mo, V, and Fe isozymes. A key component supporting the complex chemical mechanism is water, which transports multiple exogenous protons, sequentially, and assists the egress of hydrophilic ammonia. Using high&#8208;resolution crystal structures of the nitrogenase isozymes and cryoEM data, I describe and classify all intraprotein water components. A singular property is the occurrence of extensive anhydrous domains that surround the reaction zone of the cofactor. This focuses attention on the proton supply chain, a river, along which protons are transferred by a Grotthuss mechanism from protein surface to cofactor. Another river, in an opposite direction, runs along the pathway for departing NH3. I describe mechanisms for translocation of protons and of NH3 and their use of water and homocitrate. Other water features buried in the proteins include a mechanistically significant single water molecule and featureless water pools.

         <title>Glycoproteins, Glycolipids, or Both: Why do Glycosyltransferases Recognize Different Acceptors?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are essential enzymes for glycan biosynthesis and exhibit varying specificity toward glycoprotein&#8208; and glycolipid&#8208;based acceptors. This review highlights the molecular basis of GT acceptor promiscuity with its impact on disease progression in humans and potential implications in glycobiotechnology.

Glycosylation is an important post&#8208;translational modification catalyzed by glycosyltransferases (GTs), which comprise a large group of enzymes with diversified specificity. Most GTs show high specificity toward donor and acceptor molecules, but some can recognize several donor or acceptor molecules and/or create novel glycosidic linkage types. This promiscuity has profound implications for cellular processes, influencing signaling pathways, protein stability, and disease progression. GT promiscuity may result from the structural peculiarities of the enzyme and acceptor, modulation by a ligand, oligomerization with other enzymes, or its subcellular localization. In this review, current insights into GT promiscuity are discussed, highlighting its biological significance and potential associations with human diseases. A better understanding of how GTs work will be essential for developing novel therapeutic approaches and obtaining enzymes with improved properties, which are desirable in the emerging field of glycobiotechnology.

Advanced Antibody&#8211;Drug Conjugates Design: Innovation in Linker Chemistry and Site&#8208;Specific Conjugation Technologies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study highlights the importance of linker and conjugation technology in antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs). The schematic shows an antibody with a payload attached via a linker. The linker ensures stable attachment, enabling targeted drug delivery to specific cells, minimizing off&#8208;target effects, and enhancing therapeutic outcomes. This research underscores the critical role of precise conjugation in ADC efficacy and safety.

Antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a promising class of targeted cancer therapies, with the potential to improve treatment precision because of their unique mechanism of selectively delivering cytotoxic payloads (PLs) to tumor cells. ADCs combine a monoclonal antibody directed against a tumor&#8208;associated antigen with a potent cytotoxic PL via a covalent linker which connects the PL to the antibody. Several ADCs have been approved for clinical use in oncology, including Mylotarg, Adcetris, Kadcyla, Besponsa, Polivy, Lumoxiti, Padcev, Enhertu, Trodelvy, Aidixi, Zynlonta, Tivdak, Elahere, Datroway, and Emrelis. This review focuses on recent advances in linker chemistry and site&#8208;specific conjugation technologies, which are critical for optimizing ADC design and improving therapeutic indices. The development of next&#8208;generation ADCs has focused on overcoming challenges related to linker stability, efficiency of target antigen internalization, and pharmacokinetics. Traditional conjugation methods, such as lysine or cysteine conjugation, have been widely used but are associated with inherent issues of heterogeneity and instability. Advances in linker chemistry, such as the development of novel cleavable linkers, have significantly contributed to the clinical success of ADCs. In this review, different linker components are discussed, including chemical handles for conjugation, spacers to improve hydrophobicity, and triggers for PL release. In addition, innovative conjugation strategies are highlighted, which enhance ADC homogeneity and stability. The site&#8208;specific conjugation and therapeutic performance benefits of technologies such as THIOMAB, SMARTag, microbial transglutaminase, glycan remodeling, and AJICAP are discussed. The toxicity profiles of ADCs and strategies are also addressed to mitigate off&#8208;target effects and systemic toxicity. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of linker and conjugation technologies in ADC development.

         <title>Versatile Enzymatic Approach for Truncation, Labeling, and Mutation of Nucleobase&#8208;Modified Aptamers Demonstrated on Indole&#8208;Modified &#946;&#8208;Conglutin Aptamer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic methodology for truncation of base modified aptamers from 3&#8217;&#8208;, 5&#8217;&#8208; or 3&#8217;&#8208; and 5&#8217;&#8208;ends suitable also for 5&#8217;&#8208;labeling or partially mutated versions, is presented and exemplified on a &#946;&#8208;conglutin aptamer containing indole modifications.

A new enzymatic method for truncation of aptamers from 5&#8217;&#8208;end has been developed and demonstrated on a newly selected indole&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;conglutin aptamer. This method relies on extension of a primer containing ribonucleotides, which can be specifically hydrolyzed by RNase, thereby removing the whole or 5&#8217;&#8208;part of the primer. This approach enables flexible synthesis of modified aptamers truncated from the 5&#8217; end, 3&#8217; end, or both ends&#8212;a capability previously achievable only through chemical oligonucleotide synthesis. Furthermore, by employing doubly labeled primers, diverse labeled or modified nucleotides are introduced to prepare 5&#8217;&#8208;labeled aptamers suitable for fluorescence&#8208; or immobilization&#8208;based assays. The different variations of this method also enable the synthesis of mutated sequences to study the effect of modifications and their positions. Overall, this enzymatic method provides a valuable alternative for the truncation or labeling of (hyper)modified and functional oligonucleotides avoiding the need for chemical synthesis.

         <dc:description>
The &#8220;plug&#8208;and&#8208;play&#8221; nature of biocompatible chemistry makes it a powerful toolbox for investigating complicated biological systems and producing drug leads for clinical usages. This review summarizes the commonly used biocompatible reactions and the recent advances of their representative applications in chemical biology research, thus highlighting the diverse potential of biocompatible chemistry as a &#8220;plug&#8208;and&#8208;play&#8221; toolbox for future basic and translational studies.

         <title>A Review of Polyhydroxybutyrate Biosynthesis by Different Microorganisms</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights advances in microbial polyhydroxybutyrate biosynthesis as a sustainable alternative to petroleum&#8208;based plastics. It emphasizes cost&#8208;effective production strategies using engineered microbial systems, low&#8208;cost carbon sources, and waste&#8208;derived feedstocks, supporting circular economy goals. The work also discusses bioprocess innovations that reduce energy use, avoid harsh chemicals, and enhance resource efficiency.

Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) production from renewable biomass feedstocks using microorganisms provides a sustainable alternative to petroleum&#8208;based plastics, addressing critical challenges such as plastic pollution and fossil fuel consumption. Unlike previous reviews that primarily focus on single genera or metabolic mechanisms, this review provides a comprehensive comparison of multiple microbial platforms, emphasizing strain selection strategies, genetic engineering approaches, and substrate flexibility, particularly for waste valorization. Bacterial systems, while efficient, are limited by the high cost of sterile conditions. Engineered yeasts and fungi offer resilience to industrial stresses but face metabolic constraints. In addition, haloarchaeal extremophiles have gained attention for PHB synthesis under high&#8208;salinity, nonsterile conditions, offering unique advantages for cost&#8208;effective bioprocessing. Photosynthetic microorganisms integrate CO2 capture with PHB synthesis but face challenges like slow growth rates and low yields. Mixed microbial cultures provide a cost&#8208;effective approach by utilizing low&#8208;cost substrates under nonsterile conditions, though optimizing enrichment strategies remain essential to improving productivity. Future directions highlight the significance of evaluating strain selection strategies, advancing genetic engineering approaches, and scaling up production processes. Additionally, assessing technoeconomic viability and life&#8208;cycle environmental impact is crucial to support the development of PHB as a scalable, cost&#8208;effective, and environmentally friendly solution for the circular economy.

A chemical labeling strategy for tagging specific s2U&#8208;tRNAs is developed by taking advantage of a natural SelU&#8208;mediated tRNA geranylation process, using a two&#8208;step process, azidation&#8208;and&#8208;click&#8208;tagging with fluorescent dyes, namely, ACT&#8208;Flu.

RNA modifications play pivotal roles in numerous cellular processes and human diseases. In addition to the well&#8208;studied methyl&#8208;based modifications, hydrophobic prenyl&#8208;modifications have also been found in many RNA species. Herein, a chemical labeling strategy for tagging specific tRNAs by taking advantage of a natural SelU&#8208;mediated geranylation process is reported. A series of &#8220;clickable&#8221; geranyl&#8208;pyrophosphate analogs is synthesized and two candidates to label 2&#8208;thiouridine (s2U) containing tRNA using a two&#8208;step process, azidation&#8208;and&#8208;click&#8208;tagging with fluorescent dyes, namely ACT&#8208;Flu are identified. This method has also been applied to in&#8208;cell RNA imaging, providing a useful biochemical toolset to further study the biological functions of s2U&#8208;tRNAs and monitor their status in both healthy and diseased cells, since human tRNAs do not have the prenyl group on natural s2U34 modification.

         <title>Aldehyde or Hydrate? Investigation into the Oxidation of 5&#8208;Formylcytosine Derivatives Using a Computational and Experimental Approach</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrate&#8208;mediated oxidation of 5&#8208;formyl nucleobases by the iron(IV)&#8208;oxido complex proceeds via geminal diol intermediates, accelerating hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer and revealing aza&#8208;dependent kinetic and mechanistic pathways.

This study investigates the oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl and 5&#8208;formyl nucleobases using an iron(IV)&#8208;oxido complex that mimics the function of TET enzymes. A central question in this context is whether the oxidation of formyl substrates proceeds via the aldehyde or the hydrate form. To investigate the possible different reaction kinetics of these two forms, nucleobases containing a 6&#8208;aza&#8208;moiety are employed, giving rise to significantly more aldehyde hydrate as compared to the unaltered nucleobase. The concentration changes of substrates and products during oxidation were followed with 1H NMR spectroscopy. To analyze the kinetics of the oxidation reactions, a detailed numerical simulation of the stepwise sequential oxidation process is applied. 5&#8208;Hydroxymethyl nucleobases are first oxidized to the respective 5&#8208;formyl derivatives, which exist in equilibrium with their hydrate forms, and then further oxidized to the final 5&#8208;carboxyl nucleobases. The rate constants for 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl nucleobase oxidation show a good correlation with C&#63743;H bond dissociation values. The influence of hydrate formation on sequential oxidation is most prominent in the 6&#8208;aza&#8208;derivatives. The results not only deepen our understanding of substrate oxidation by iron&#8208;oxido species but also pave the way for future studies on related biological oxidation mechanisms.

         <title>Functional Analysis of Histidine&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Cleaving RNAs Obtained by In Vitro Selection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ribozymes can be nucleic acid medicines given their catalytic activity. We attempted to obtain functional RNAs that mimic ribonuclease A catalytic mechanisms. Functional RNAs with high histidine specificity were obtained, suggesting that histidine acts in active structure formation. These RNAs can be applied as aptazymes with histidine as a cofactor.

Ribozymes, ribonucleic acids with enzymatic functions, have not yet been practically used in nucleic acid medicine, possibly due to their low activity levels. We hypothesized that functional RNAs with high activity can be obtained by mimicking the catalytic reactions of ribonuclease A. We aimed to obtain histidine&#8208;dependent functional RNAs from an RNA library using in vitro selection with L&#8208;histidine. An RNA library with a random sequence of 70 nucleotides was constructed and used. A self&#8208;cleaving RNA (I&#8208;04) with histidine specificity and a rate constant of kobs(I&#8722;04)&#8201;=&#8201;4.6&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;3 (min&#8722;1) at pH 5.0 was obtained. Owing to its low activity, reselection was performed. II&#8208;28, obtained on the second selection, showed cleavage activity in the presence of histidine, but not with histidine analogs. The rate constant of II&#8208;28 was kobs(II&#8722;28)&#8201;=&#8201;3.0&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;3 (min&#8722;1) at pH 5.0, comparable to that of I&#8208;04. The activity of these molecules, however, is very low and different from that of ribonuclease A. Several histidine&#8208;dependent and divalent metal ion&#8208;independent self&#8208;cleaving RNAs were obtained. The pH profile of the RNAs suggested that histidine was not utilized as a catalytic residue, but histidine was presumed to be working in the formation of the active structure.

         <title>In Vivo Biosynthesis and Direct Incorporation of Noncanonical Amino Acids into Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review evaluates engineered (semi)autonomous cell systems for the biosynthesis and incorporation of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins. While semi&#8208;autonomous cells convert supplied precursors into ncAAs autonomous cells integrate biosynthetic pathways that produce these building blocks intracellularly. Such integrated approaches significantly reduce process costs, can increase protein yields, and overcome challenges such as the limited membrane permeability of ncAAs.

Autonomous cells are engineered biological systems capable of biosynthesising and directly incorporating noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins. These systems have the potential to extend the applicability of the genetic code to enable large&#8208;scale fermentative production of proteins carrying ncAAs. This work evaluates approaches for the generation of autonomous and semi&#8208;autonomous cells. Semi&#8208;autonomous cells rely on the external addition of a precursor, which is enzymatically converted in&#8201;vivo to an ncAA that is directly incorporated. In contrast, autonomous cells have a metabolic system that produces and directly incorporates an ncAA in&#8201;vivo. Through a critical evaluation of the state of the art, the reader is provided with an opinion on the future development of the field.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Deuterium Exchange Defines Ligand&#8208;Induced Conformational Changes to the Class III Biotin Protein Ligase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;deuterium exchange mass spectrometry validated AlphaFold structural prediction of the class III biotin protein ligase (BPL) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and revealed a structured domain in the N&#8208;terminal extension characteristic to this class of BPL. Ligand binding to ScBPL induced localized conformational changes in the active site and N&#8208;terminal domain, with reduced conformational sampling and increased stability.

Biotin protein ligase (BPL) catalyzes the covalent attachment of biotin onto biotin&#8208;dependent enzymes, where it functions as an essential cofactor. Eukaryotic BPLs are distinct due to the presence of a large N&#8208;terminal extension to the conserved catalytic domain and C&#8208;terminal cap. No high&#8208;resolution structures of a eukaryotic BPL have been solved; however, previous functional studies revealed the N&#8208;terminal extension interacts with the biotinylation substrate. Mass spectrometry (MS) and complementary techniques were utilized to investigate the structure of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae BPL (ScBPL). Lower resolution techniques suggested holo&#8208;ScBPL had a more compact structure and sampled fewer conformational states. In addition, solution&#8208;phase and a charge state dependent gas&#8208;phase stabilization was observed. Hydrogen&#8208;deuterium exchange (HDX) MS provided experimental validation of the AlphaFold predicted structure of ScBPL, with a folded domain structurally homologous to a glutamine amidotransferase identified in the N&#8208;terminal extension, and a mostly homologous catalytic domain to that of other species&#8217; BPLs. Further HDX analyses identified localized conformational changes in the ScBPL active site and N&#8208;terminal domain that occur concomitantly with ligand binding. These data provide novel insights into the unique structure of a class III BPL and how ligands influence this structure for catalysis of protein biotinylation.

         <title>Mechanoglycobiology: The Roles of Cell Surface Glycans in Mechanosensing and Mechanotransduction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycans in the cell glycocalyx play an important role in sensing and transducing biophysical cues, for example, mechanical forces applied to cells, to provoke cellular responses and mediate various physiological and pathological processes, which is the research subject of mechanoglycobiology and may have a wide range of biological and biomedical applications.

Mechanoglycobiology has emerged as a rapidly expanding interdisciplinary field that involves chemistry, biology, and engineering. Despite the great advancements in this field, in&#8208;depth investigation of mechanoglycobiology remains challenging due to the complex nature of glycans and cell glycocalyx, as well as the difficulty to mechanically target these biomolecules. To address the issues, novel methods and models have been established to facilitate the investigation of glycan&#8208;mediated mechanosensing and mechanotransduction. Recently, a new, metabolic glycoengineering&#8208;based approach has been developed to selectively label cell surface glycans. This enables the application of molecularly specific acoustic tweezing cytometry to exert targeted mechanical forces to understand how mechanical actuation of glycans influences cellular activities. This approach is applicable to different glycans and cell types and, therefore, can have a broad impact. The current perspective highlights how recent developments in mechanoglycobiology may improve the knowledge and appreciation of the significance of glycans in&#160;mechanotransduction as well as the potential applications of mechanoglycobiology in medicine.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Triggered Hyaluronic Acid Hydrogel for 3D Culture and Cell Recovery</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
GA: Cross&#8208;linking of hyaluronic acid modified by a strained alkyne with a photosensitive crosslinker terminating in azides gives hydrogels with tuneable mechanical properties. By tuning the wavelength of employed light, the hydrogel can either be fully degraded allowing harvesting of cultured cells or softened resulting in notable changes in cell morphology.

Properties of semisynthetic hydrogels can be fine&#8208;tuned, making these attractive for various applications in regenerative medicine. Herein, a hydrogel platform based on hyaluronic acid (HA) modified by (1R, 8S,9S)&#8208;bicycle[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;9&#8208;ylmethanol (BCN) and a cross&#8208;linker composed of light&#8208;sensitive o&#8208;nitrobenzyl and polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains terminating in azides is described. The two components can undergo strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition resulting in rapid gel formation. First, adipose&#8208;derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are incorporated in the hydrogel and it is demonstrated that the cells can be easily retrieved by UV light&#8208;mediated degradation, maintaining viability and retaining spindle&#8208;like shape when the cells are replated. Next, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of inducing light&#8208;mediated softening of the hydrogel to modulate the morphology of the encapsulated cells is provided. A co&#8208;culture of endothelial cells (cord blood&#8208;derived endothelial colony forming cells and bone marrow&#8208;derived MSCs), which is commonly studied for their ability to form capillary&#8208;like vascular networks, is cultured in the regular and light&#8208;induced softened hydrogels. Nonphotoexposed hydrogels show cells with a prevalently rounded morphology, whereas stretched cells connecting into a primitive capillary network are observed in the light&#8208;softened hydrogels. Photo&#8208;induced softening offers potential to locally control cell shape and self&#8208;organization capacity.

         <title>Exploring the Substrate Flexibility of GrsB Thioesterase Leads to the Structural Reassignment of a Gramicidin S Variant</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigation of the substrate specificity of gramicidin S synthetase B&#8208;thioesterase reveals stereochemical flexibility, enabling the production of gramicidin S (GS) analogs with L&#8208; or D&#8208;Ser(Allyl). Structural reassignment of a GS variant (GS&#8208;SA) obtained from precursor&#8208;directed biosynthesis is achieved using liquid chromatography&#8208;mass spectrometry, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance, and antimicrobial assays.

Gramicidin S (GS) is a cyclic decapeptide derived from two pentapeptides. The C&#8208;terminal thioesterase (TE) domain of gramicidin S synthetase B (GrsB) dimerizes precursor pentapeptides and cyclizes the resulting linear decapeptide. Recently, a GS variant (GS&#8208;SA), in which a single D&#8208;Phe is replaced by L&#8208;Ser(Allyl), is reported via precursor&#8208;directed biosynthesis in a native GS producer. To understand how GrsB&#8208;TE processes such modified precursors, its substrate specificity using synthetic linear peptides is investigated. GrsB&#8208;TE cyclizes a substrate containing L&#8208;Ser(Allyl) at position 6 but not at position 1. However, the enzymatically synthesized GS&#8208;SA shows a different high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography retention time than that of the reported GS variant. Further structural and functional analyses, including 1H nuclear magnetic resonance, antimicrobial assays, and circular dichroism spectroscopy, reveal that the reported GS&#8208;SA contained D&#8208;Ser(Allyl) rather than L&#8208;Ser(Allyl). These findings reveal a previously unrecognized stereochemical flexibility in GrsB&#8208;TE and support the structural revision of the reported GS variant.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Dithiocarbamato Glycoconjugates as Potential Anticancer Agents: Design, Physico&#8208;Chemical Characterization, and In Vitro Biological Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;dithiocarbamato glycoconjugates based on gold(III), gold(I)&#8208;phosphino, and gold(I)&#8208;carbene scaffolds are here investigated as potential anticancer agents. Contrary to expectations, they induce cell death by acting at the extracellular level rather than targeting overexpressed glucose transporters.

To develop new metal&#8208;based glycoconjugates as potential anticancer agents, three gold(III)&#8208;dithiocarbamato glycoconjugates of the type [AuIIIBr2(SSC&#8208;Inp&#8208;GlcN)] (Au3&#8208;5), their gold(I)&#8208;phosphine counterparts [AuI(SSC&#8208;Inp&#8208;GlcN)(PPh3)] (AuP3&#8208;5), and gold(I)&#8208;carbene analogs [AuI(SSC&#8208;Inp&#8208;GlcN)(Et2BzImy)] (AuC3&#8208;5) (Inp: isonipecotic moiety; GlcN: amino&#8208;glucose scaffold; Et2BzImy: 1,3&#8208;diethylbenzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene moiety), as well as the corresponding non&#8208;glycosylated counterparts (Au1&#8208;2, AuP1&#8208;2, and AuC1&#8208;2) bearing a terminal ester or amide function, are generated and characterized by means of several analytical techniques (FT&#8208;IR, 1H&#8208;/13C&#8208;NMR, UV&#8211;Vis, X&#8208;ray crystallography). Their stability under physiologically relevant conditions (phosphate&#8208;buffered saline solution) has also been evaluated. Contrary to the gold(III)&#8208;glycoconjugates, the glucose&#8208;functionalized gold(I) derivatives show a significant antiproliferative effect against colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT&#8208;29), metastatic breast adenocarcinoma (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231), and breast adenocarcinoma (MCF&#8208;7) cells, with IC50 values in the low micromolar range, the gold(I)&#8208;phosphine derivatives turning up to be the best performers. Cell uptake studies show no evident correlation between cell growth inhibition and cellular uptake, and the use of glucose&#8208;free cell culture media and a GLUT1 inhibitor rules out the involvement of glucose transporters in cell internalization, thus suggesting alternative cell death pathways such as acting at extracellular level (especially for the gold(I) derivatives).

         <title>Docking and Molecular Dynamics Simulation&#8208;Based Analysis of Advanced Small&#8208;Molecule Kinase Inhibitors Identified pre&#8208;let&#8208;7 miRNA Binders</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated computational approach evaluating the binding between pre&#8208;let&#8208;7 microRNA and small&#8208;molecule kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) revealed varied pre&#8208;let&#8208;7 binding affinities among the advanced SMKIs. The results justified the characterization of potential RNA targets for kinase inhibitors and small molecules with protein targets in general.

RNAs play crucial roles in various cellular actions, and the uncontrolled expression or improper folding of RNAs is a cause of many diseases. Certain oncogenic phenotypes stem from the overexpression of regulatory microRNAs that contain secondary structural elements. Thus, targeting disease&#8208;related microRNAs with small molecules is a potential therapeutic&#160;strategy that has attracted growing interest. To probe the RNA&#8208;binding chemical space held in advanced small&#8208;molecule therapeutics, in this work, we screened the 78 FDA&#8208;approved small&#8208;molecule kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) as representatives of the most advanced kinase inhibitors for their binding affinity with pre&#8208;let&#8208;7 miRNA via a combination of computational methods and biophysical measurement. The best&#8208;ranked SMKIs based on docking scores were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation studies, followed by analysis of different computational parameters. Collectively, it provided reliable information on the binding affinity for the top&#8208;performed SMKI in the formation of SMKI&#8211;miRNA complexes with pre&#8208;let&#8208;7. Furthermore, the identification of the predicted most promising SMKI&#8211;miRNA interactions was validated by microscale thermophoresis, measuring direct binding affinities. This study evaluating the binding landscapes of the 78 FDA&#8208;approved SMKIs with pre&#8208;let&#8208;7 miRNA served as an example highlighting the necessity to characterize the biological targets of SMKIs, many of which are FDA&#8208;approved cancer agents, at the transcriptomic level with RNAs.

&lt;p&gt;An integrated computational approach evaluating the binding between pre-&lt;i&gt;let&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;7&lt;/i&gt; microRNA and small-molecule kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) revealed varied pre-&lt;i&gt;let&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;7&lt;/i&gt; binding affinities among the advanced SMKIs. The results justified the characterization of potential RNA targets for kinase inhibitors and small molecules with protein targets in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RNAs play crucial roles in various cellular actions, and the uncontrolled expression or improper folding of RNAs is a cause of many diseases. Certain oncogenic phenotypes stem from the overexpression of regulatory microRNAs that contain secondary structural elements. Thus, targeting disease-related microRNAs with small molecules is a potential therapeutic&#160;strategy that has attracted growing interest. To probe the RNA-binding chemical space held in advanced small-molecule therapeutics, in this work, we screened the 78 FDA-approved small-molecule kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) as representatives of the most advanced kinase inhibitors for their binding affinity with pre-&lt;i&gt;let-7&lt;/i&gt; miRNA via a combination of computational methods and biophysical measurement. The best-ranked SMKIs based on docking scores were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation studies, followed by analysis of different computational parameters. Collectively, it provided reliable information on the binding affinity for the top-performed SMKI in the formation of SMKI&#8211;miRNA complexes with pre-&lt;i&gt;let-7.&lt;/i&gt; Furthermore, the identification of the predicted most promising SMKI&#8211;miRNA interactions was validated by microscale thermophoresis, measuring direct binding affinities. This study evaluating the binding landscapes of the 78 FDA-approved SMKIs with pre-&lt;i&gt;let-7&lt;/i&gt; miRNA served as an example highlighting the necessity to characterize the biological targets of SMKIs, many of which are FDA-approved cancer agents, at the transcriptomic level with RNAs. The study also illustrates the possibility that the interaction with RNA targets may contribute to the observed biological and clinical performance of these approved SMKIs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Internal Ubiquitin Electrophiles for Covalent Trapping and Inhibition of Deubiquitinases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
GA: Genetically encoded internal electrophiles in ubiquitin (Ub) enable the profiling of multivalent interaction interfaces, addressing a key limitation of current Ub&#8208;based activity&#8208;based probes. In this study, these probes capture a Ub&#8211;deubiquitinase interaction with minimal structural perturbation and serve as selective diUb probes that covalently target the catalytic cysteines of Met1&#8208;specific Dubs. 

The ubiquitin (Ub) system governs vital cellular processes in eukaryotic biology through an intricate network of Ub&#8211;protein interactions. While semisynthetic C&#8208;terminal Ub electrophiles (UbEs) are widely used to study Ub transfer and deubiquitinase (Dub) activity, they are limited to probing the active site while leaving other functionally important sites unexplored. Building on previously identified multivalent interaction interfaces and potential allosteric sites which are key to understanding their dynamic nature, here we report the development of genetically encoded Ub&#8208;based probes to covalently tether Ub&#8208;protein interactions in a proximity&#8208;driven manner at distal locations away from the active site. This study demonstrates that UbEs with internal electrophiles maintain conformational changes observed with their C&#8208;terminal counterparts while circumventing their limitations in capturing distal binding&#8208;site complexes, an emerging feature in Ub&#8208;mediated regulation. Genetically encoding these electrophiles further demonstrate rational variation as activity&#8208;based probes (ABP), leading to a Met1&#8208;diUb ABP showing preference for OTULIN over other Met1 cleaving Dubs. Taken together, our study introduces genetically encoded Ub&#8208;based probes to explore the structural and biochemical significance of Ub&#8208;Dub interactions beyond the canonical S1 site, overcoming some limitations of traditional Ub C&#8208;terminal electrophiles.

         <title>Adding A C&#8208;Terminal Amino Acid Prevents the Conformational Interconversion of Plecantide Analogs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bicyclic Peptide Conformational Locks: Plecanatide, an FDA&#8208;endorsed therapy for chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, faces stability challenges in acidic environments. The innovative approach involved appending a functional amino acid to the C&#8208;termini, transforming plecanatide into highly stable isomers that retained or enhanced their GC&#8208;C agonistic activity.

The principle of structure dictating properties is illustrated by the direct correlation between cyclic peptide conformation and their biological efficacy. Plecanatide, a synthetic analog of uroguanylin, has received FDA approval for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. Nevertheless, our investigation has revealed that plecanatide undergoes slow conformational interconversion in slightly acidic conditions. In response, propargylglycine is strategically incorporated at the carboxyl terminal of plecanatide, a modification that not only facilitates additional functionalization and derivatizationbut also confers exceptional conformational stability. Remarkably, the resulting isomers not only maintained long&#8208;term conformational stability but also exhibited either preserved or slightly enhanced agonistic activity. This discovery represents a contribution to drug research focused on plecanatide, particularly in elucidating the relationship between its conformational properties and biological activity.

         <title>Precision Delivery of CRISPR/Cas Systems via DNA Nanostructures for Gene Therapy and Intracellular Detection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of gene editing technology has catalyzed a paradigm shift in life science research, with the CRISPR/Cas system emerging as a cornerstone tool in modern biology due to its transformative capabilities. This review systematically examines current delivery modalities for CRISPR/Cas systems (Cas9, Cas12, Cas13), with particular emphasis on the implementation of DNA&#8208;based functional materials as advanced delivery vehicles.

The CRISPR/Cas system represents a transformative breakthrough in genome editing technology, featuring three principal effector proteins with distinct functionalities: Cas9, which induces site&#8208;specific double&#8208;strand breaks guided by a single guide RNA, enabling precise gene knockout and knock&#8208;in modifications; Cas12, which mediates targeted DNA cleavage through cis&#8208;activity while exhibiting nonspecific trans&#8208;cleavage of single&#8208;stranded DNA, a property exploited for ultrasensitive nucleic acid detection in molecular diagnostics; and Cas13, an RNA&#8208;guided RNase that specifically degrades complementary RNA transcripts, demonstrating significant potential for antiviral therapies and transcriptome regulation. Despite these advances, the clinical translation of CRISPR/Cas systems faces substantial challenges, particularly in achieving efficient and controllable delivery. This reviewsystematically examines current delivery modalities for CRISPR/Cas systems, with particular emphasis on the implementation of DNA&#8208;based functional materials as advanced delivery vehicles. The integration of multifunctional DNA nanostructures with diverse CRISPR/Cas systems may facilitate the development of integrated theranostic platforms, thereby advancing precision medicine through synergistic bioengineering approaches.

         <title>Regulation of Gene Expression of Mouse D&#8208;Amino Acid Oxidase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The front cover illustration shows the transcriptional regulation of the mouse D&#8208;amino acid oxidase (DAO) gene. Key TFs act on the core promoter to stimulate DAO expression, leading to D&#8208;serine metabolism and influencing neurotransmission. This reflects the study's discovery of conserved regulatory elements in DAO gene control.

D&#8208;amino acid oxidase (DAO) catalyzes oxidative deamination of D&#8208;amino acids, producing 2&#8208;oxo acids, hydrogen peroxide, and ammonia. In mammals, DAO is essential for metabolizing both endogenous and exogenous D&#8208;amino acids. Previous studies on human DAO identify two promoter regions (P1 and P2), a negative regulatory element in intron 1, and several transcription factor (TF) binding sites. In this study, the regulatory mechanism of mouse DAO gene expression is investigated to compare with the human system. To determine the promoter activity in the upstream region of the initiation site, plasmids containing mouse DAO gene fragments inserted into the pGL4 [luc2P/Hygro] vector and assessed luciferase activity in LLC&#8208;PK1 cells are constructed. A series of deletion constructs is analyzed, revealing promoter activity in all tested fragments. The highest promoter activity is detected in the &#8722;333/&#8722;87 subregion, with residual activities in the &#8722;87/&#8201;+&#8201;111 region. Bioinformatics analysis identifies TFs, including NEUR, EGRF, ZF07, ZF11, KLFS, SP1F, and ZF02, which bind to both the human and mouse DAO genes at conserved positions, suggesting their critical role in regulating DAO promoter activity.

         <title>Dominant&#8208;Negative Effects of p53 R337 Variants in Li&#8211;Fraumeni Syndrome: Impact on Tetramer Formation and Transcriptional Activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hetero&#8208;tetramer dysfunction: Li&#8211;Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a hereditary cancer predisposition caused by mutations in the TP53 gene encoding the tumor suppressor p53. It is shown that p53 variants R337C and R337H, found in LFS, impair wild&#8208;type (WT) p53 function by forming heterotetramers with reduced transcriptional activity. This dominant&#8208;negative&#8208;like effect may explain tissue&#8208;specific tumor susceptibility in LFS.

Li&#8211;Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an inherited cancer predisposition disorder caused by heterozygous TP53 mutations. Among these, missense mutations at Arg337&#8212;such as R337C and R337H&#8212;are common in LFS patients. Although many studies have characterized individual p53 variants in LFS, the impact of tetramerization domain (TD) mutations on wild&#8208;type (WT) p53 function remains unclear. Herein, a novel FRET&#8208;based assay system that enables the simultaneous detection of heterotetramer formation and p53&#8208;dependent transcriptional activity in live cells is developed. These results show that the heteromultimerization of the R337C variant with WT p53 is only slightly reduced compared to WT homotetramers, yet its transcriptional activity is diminished by over 50%. In contrast, the R337H variant forms heterotetramers at near&#8208;normal levels but exhibits markedly compromised transcriptional activity. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized dominant&#8208;negative&#8208;like effect, suggesting reduced p53 function is due not only to decreased tetramer formation but also to diminished heterotetramer stability. Moreover, the LFS&#8208;associated p53TD variants show a greater loss of activity against the low&#8208;affinity, apoptosis&#8208;inducing bax response element than against the high&#8208;affinity, cell cycle arrest&#8208;related CDKN1A response element. Collectively, this study demonstrates that p53TD mutations can exert dominant&#8208;negative effects, advancing the understanding of p53 heteromultimer function in LFS pathogenesis. These mechanistic insights into p53 heterotetramer stability may not only inform genetic screening strategies for LFS but also support future therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring p53 function by stabilizing mutant tetramers.

     alt="Dominant-Negative Effects of p53 R337 Variants in Li&#8211;Fraumeni Syndrome: Impact on Tetramer Formation and Transcriptional Activity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hetero-tetramer dysfunction:&lt;/i&gt; Li&#8211;Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a hereditary cancer predisposition caused by mutations in the &lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt; gene encoding the tumor suppressor p53. It is shown that p53 variants R337C and R337H, found in LFS, impair wild-type (WT) p53 function by forming heterotetramers with reduced transcriptional activity. This dominant-negative-like effect may explain tissue-specific tumor susceptibility in LFS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li&#8211;Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an inherited cancer predisposition disorder caused by heterozygous &lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt; mutations. Among these, missense mutations at Arg337&#8212;such as R337C and R337H&#8212;are common in LFS patients. Although many studies have characterized individual p53 variants in LFS, the impact of tetramerization domain (TD) mutations on wild-type (WT) p53 function remains unclear. Herein, a novel FRET-based assay system that enables the simultaneous detection of heterotetramer formation and p53-dependent transcriptional activity in live cells is developed. These results show that the heteromultimerization of the R337C variant with WT p53 is only slightly reduced compared to WT homotetramers, yet its transcriptional activity is diminished by over 50%. In contrast, the R337H variant forms heterotetramers at near-normal levels but exhibits markedly compromised transcriptional activity. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized dominant-negative-like effect, suggesting reduced p53 function is due not only to decreased tetramer formation but also to diminished heterotetramer stability. Moreover, the LFS-associated p53TD variants show a greater loss of activity against the low-affinity, apoptosis-inducing &lt;i&gt;bax&lt;/i&gt; response element than against the high-affinity, cell cycle arrest-related &lt;i&gt;CDKN1A&lt;/i&gt; response element. Collectively, this study demonstrates that p53TD mutations can exert dominant-negative effects, advancing the understanding of p53 heteromultimer function in LFS pathogenesis. These mechanistic insights into p53 heterotetramer stability may not only inform genetic screening strategies for LFS but also support future therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring p53 function by stabilizing mutant tetramers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemically Synthesized LRAD3&#8208;D1 Interacts with N&#8208;Terminal Domain of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Protein</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical synthesis, calcium&#8208;templated in&#8208;vitro folding and competitive ELISA assay reveal that only domain 1 of the LRAD3 ectodomain interacts with the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;related corona virus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) spike NTD, while domains 2 and 3 do not, providing valuable insight into ACE2&#8208;independent viral entry pathways that may contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches targeting SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 strains associated with severe neurological complications.

Growing evidence of post&#8208;COVID neurological complications, such as encephalopathy, neurodegeneration, and cognitive impairment, suggests severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;related corona virus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) viral infection into the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of viral entry into the CNS, where human angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is barely expressed, is critical for addressing the neurological consequences of COVID&#8208;19. Importantly, the low&#8208;density lipoprotein receptor class A domain containing 3 (LRAD3) is overexpressed in brain cells, suggesting a possible ACE2&#8208;independent alternate pathway of viral entry into brain cells. Herein, the interaction of the chemically synthesized LRAD3 domains with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein is reported. It is observed that the extracellular domains of LRAD3 depend on calcium for proper folding and maintaining their structural integrity. The results reveal that domain 1 of LRAD3, which is most accessible from the cell surface, engages with the N&#8208;terminal domain of the viral spike protein. These findings open up possibilities to develop new therapeutic strategies targeting ACE2 independent viral entry pathways.

         <title>Poly(ethylene Glycol)&#8208;Based Peptidomimetics (Pegtides) of Antimicrobial Peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is commonly used to improve the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of therapeutic candidates by conjugation. Here PEG is exploited for peptidomimetic conversion of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), as candidate antibacterial agents, by replacing their polyamide backbone. The pegtides obtained thereby can be readily synthesized from inexpensive starting materials and demonstrate properties commensurate of AMP mimetics.

Cationic amphipathic poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;based polymers are generated with synthetic efficiencies allowing their evaluation as antimicrobial peptide (AMP) mimetics. Accordingly, statistical copolymers with cationic units consistently functionalized with guanyl groups, but different side&#8208;chain lengths, and hydrophobic units displaying long aliphatic, branched, and/or aromatic side chains are produced and tested for their antimicrobial and hemolytic properties. The results obtained indicate that candidates with activities and selectivity commensurate to some AMPs can be obtained and that further development of this novel type of antimicrobial peptidomimetics, pegtides, is warranted for clinical and/or biotechnological applications.

         <title>Design and Characterization of Prodrugged Anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 Antibodies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Therapeutic antibodies are widely used to treat diseases like cancer and inflammatory conditions by binding with high specificity to their molecular targets. Masking is a strategy to mitigate undesirable activity in non&#8208;target tissues, improving safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles by reducing target&#8208;mediated drug disposition (TMDD). In this study, we explored masking an anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 antibody by conjugating a large PEG molecule to specific sites on the antibody. While anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 immunotherapy benefits solid tumor treatment, its adverse events limit its utility. We evaluated multiple conjugation sites within the complementarity&#8208;determining regions (CDRs) and adjacent framework regions to attenuate CTLA&#8208;4 binding. We identified the optimal site for maximizing masking efficiency, allowing for efficient bioconjugation and functional restoration upon exposure to a cleaving enzyme in the tumor microenvironment. The prodrugged antibody exhibited reduced binding to CTLA&#8208;4 and Fc gamma receptors (FcgRs), high stability, and an extended half&#8208;life in a mouse model. This technology has the potential to improve the PK profile and safety attributes of therapeutic antibodies.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Stabilization of Collagen Mimetic Triple Helices and Assemblies by Dopa Crosslinking</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Creating thermally stable collagen mimetic peptides (CMPs) is a persistent challenge. Nature leverages covalent crosslinkings to stabilize collagen's triple helix&#160;and higher&#8208;order assemblies. Herein, we demonstrate that crosslinkings between levodopa (Dopa) and lysine can covalently stabilize the triple helix in collagen mimetic peptides. Since alkaline conditions catalyze the oxidation of the catechol on Dopa to a benzoquinone, while being in proximity to the nucleophilic lysine, we hypothesized that this reaction could be a facile method to covalently capture the supramolecular structure of CMPs by simply increasing the pH of the aqueous solvent with the addition of sodium hydroxide. This strategy covalently stabilizes CMP homotrimers and a de novo designed ABC&#8208;type heterotrimer demonstrating that the Lysine&#8208;Dopa covalent bond is best templated by a supramolecular, axial cation&#8208;&#960; pairwise interaction. In nature, collagen can hierarchically assemble into fibers. This behavior can be mimicked with the self&#8208;assembly of CMPs, but the resulting nanofibers typically exhibit thermal stability below body temperature. In a final application, we demonstrate that Dopa&#8208;Lysine covalent capture also enhances the thermal stability of CMP nanofibers well above 37 &#176;C. This biomimetic covalent capture strategy can stabilize a wide variety of CMP systems and potentially enable the biomedical application of these materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Glucagon via Molecular and Formulation Strategies: From Natural Hormone to Effective and Stable Therapeutics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glucagon, a 29&#8208;amino acid pancreatic hormone, plays a central role in glucose homeostasis through activation of the glucagon receptor (GCGR). While clinically essential for hypoglycemia rescue, its broader therapeutic applications face limitations due to challenging biophysical properties including poor solubility, strong aggregation tendency, and chemical instability, which currently require lyophilized formulations. Recent advances in peptide engineering and formulation science have enabled the development of next&#8208;generation glucagon analogs with enhanced stability and ready&#8208;to&#8208;use profiles. Moving beyond its classical role in glucose elevation, glucagon is now recognized as a multifunctional metabolic regulator influencing lipid metabolism, energy expenditure, and cardiorenal function. This expanded understanding has driven the development of innovative GCGR&#8208;targeting therapies including multi&#8208;receptor agonists such as glucagon&#8208;like peptide&#8208;1 receptor (GLP&#8208;1R)/GCGR co&#8208;agonists for metabolic disorders and advanced dual&#8208;hormone delivery systems. This review examines the evolving pharmacology of glucagon by analyzing: (1) structural optimization and formulation strategies to address physicochemical challenges, (2) innovative delivery technologies, and (3) emerging therapeutic applications in metabolic diseases. Through critical assessment of translational challenges, this work bridges molecular insights with clinical innovation in glucagon&#8208;based therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding of Hg(I) and Hg(II) Ions to Amyloid&#8208;Beta (A&#946;) Peptide Variants Affect Their Structure and Aggregation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mercury (Hg) exposure is a possible risk factor for Alzheimer&#180;s disease (AD). Some studies reported higher Hg levels in AD patients, but evidence is inconclusive. A mechanism linking Hg exposure to AD neuropathology remains to be found. The hallmark of AD brains is deposits of insoluble amyloid plaques consisting mainly of aggregated amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides.
&#160;
Here, we use transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and biophysical spectroscopy techniques to study in vitro interactions between inorganic Hg and pathologically relevant A&#946;(1&#8208;40) and A&#946;(4&#8208;40) variants and the A&#946;(1&#8208;40)(H6A, H13A, H14A) mutant. For the first time, effect on A&#946; aggregation of both Hg(I) and Hg(II) is compared.
&#160;
Hg(II) binds A&#946;(1&#8208;40) with apparent binding affinity of 28&#177;8 &#181;M, at 20 &#176;C in 20 mM MES buffer, pH 7.3. The N&#8208;terminal His6, His13 and His14 residues are involved in binding coordination. Hg(II) binding induces structural alterations (coil&#8208;coil interactions) in A&#946; monomers positioned in membrane&#8208;mimicking SDS micelles. Equimolar amounts of either Hg(I) or Hg(II) inhibit normal A&#946; fibrillation by directing aggregation towards formation of large amorphous aggregates. All these structural rearrangements may be relevant for the harmful A&#946; aggregation processes involved in AD brain pathology. Inducing protein misfolding and aggregation might be a general toxic mechanism of mercury.</dc:description>
