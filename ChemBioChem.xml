         <title>The Dynamic Range of Acidity: Tracking Rules for the Unidirectional Penetration of Cellular Compartments</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Labeled ammonium cations with p  K  a  ~ 7.4 accumulate in acidic organelles because they can be neutralized transiently to cross the membrane at cytosolic pH 7.2 but not at their internal pH &lt; 5.5. Retention in early endosomes with less acidic internal pH was achieved recently using weaker acids up to p  K  a  9.8. We report here that primary ammonium cations with higher p  K  a  10.6 label early endosomes more efficiently. This maximized early endosome tracking coincides with increasing labeling of Golgi networks with similarly weak internal acidity. Guanidinium cations with p  K  a  13.5 cannot cross the plasma membrane in monomeric form and label the plasma membrane with selectivity for vesicles embarking into endocytosis. Self&#8208;assembled into micelles, guanidinium cations enter cells like arginine&#8208;rich cell&#8208;penetrating peptides and, driven by their membrane potential, penetrate mitochondria unidirectionally despite their high inner pH. The resulting tracking rules with an approximated dynamic range of p  K  a  change ~3.5 are expected to be generally valid, thus enabling the design of chemistry tools for biology research in the broadest sense. From a practical point of view, most relevant are two complementary fluorescent flipper probes that can be used to image the mechanics at the very beginning of endocytosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization of 2&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine in Duplex, G&#8208;Quadruplex and i&#8208;Motif</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small, but effective modification: Canonical and non&#8208;canonical DNA structures containing 2&#8208;fluoroadenosine (2FA) were characterized by thermal stability and CD spectroscopy. The results show interesting features such as high thermal stability of the 2FA&#8208;C base pair and different structural influences on G&#8208;quadruplexes in the presence of sodium ions. Incorporation of 2FA into the i&#8208;motif induced small increases in pKa.







Abstract
Among various kinds of fluorine&#8208;substituted biomolecules, 2&#8208;fluoroadenine (2FA) and its derivatives have been actively investigated as therapeutic reagents, radio&#8208;sensitizers, and 19F NMR probes. In spite of their excellent properties, DNA containing 2FA has not been studied well. For fundamental understanding and future applications to the development of functional nucleic acids, we characterized 2FA&#8208;containing oligonucleotides for canonical right&#8208;handed DNA duplex, G&#8208;quadruplex, and i&#8208;motif structures. Properties of 2FA were similar to native adenine due to the small size of the fluorine atom, but it showed unique features caused by high electronegativity. This work provides useful information for future application of 2FA&#8208;modified DNA.

         <title>2&#8208;Aminopurine Fluorescence Spectroscopy for Probing a Glucose Binding Aptamer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using 2&#8208;aminopurine fluorescence spectroscopy, the glucose binding DNA aptamer showed binding to glucose and glucose containing disaccharides. This enthalpy&#8208;driven binding reaction requires two Na+ ions or one Mg2+ ion, and the Na+ binding state has a higher affinity for glucose.







Abstract
Glucose is the most important analyte for biosensors. Recently a DNA aptamer was reported allowing binding&#8208;based detection. However, due to a relatively weak binding affinity, it is difficult to perform binding assays to understand the property of this aptamer. In this work, we replaced the only adenine base in the aptamer binding pocket with a 2&#8208;aminopurine (2AP) and used fluorescence spectroscopy to study glucose binding. In the selection buffer, glucose increased the 2AP fluorescence with a Kd of 15.0&#8197;mM glucose, which was comparable with the 10&#8197;mM Kd previously reported using the strand displacement assay. The binding required two Na+ ions or one Mg2+ that cannot be replaced by Li+ or K+. The binding was weaker at higher temperature and its van't Hoff plot indicated enthalpy&#8208;driven binding. While other monosaccharides failed to achieve saturated binding even at high concentrations, two glucose&#8208;containing disaccharides, namely trehalose and sucrose, reached a similar fluorescence level as glucose although with over 10&#8208;fold higher Kd values. Detection limits in both the selection buffer (0.9&#8197;mM) and in artificial interstitial fluids (6.0&#8197;mM) were measured.

         <title>Context&#8208;dependence of the Reactivity of Cysteine and Lysine Residues</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The&#160;S&#8208;alkylation of Cys residues with a maleimide and the&#160;N&#949;&#8208;acylation of Lys residues with an&#160;N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester are common methods for bioconjugation. Using Cys and Lys derivatives as proxies, we assessed differences in reactivity depending on the position of Cys or Lys in a protein sequence. We find that Cys position is exploitable to improve site&#8208;selectivity in maleimide&#8208;based modifications. Reactivity decreases substantially in the order N&#8209;terminal &gt; in&#8208;chain &gt; C&#8208;terminal Cys due to modulation of sulfhydryl pKa by the &#945;&#8208;ammonium and carboxylate groups at the termini. A lower pKa value yields a larger fraction thiolate, which promotes selectivity while somewhat decreasing thiolate nucleophilicity in accord with&#160;&#946;nuc = 0.41. Lowering pH and salt concentration enhances selectivity still further. In contrast, differences in the reactivity of Lys towards an NHS ester were modest due to an appreciable decrease in amino group nucleophilicity with a lower pKa of its conjugate acid. Hence, site&#8208;selective Lys modification protocols will require electrophiles other than NHS esters.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatio&#8208;Temporal Photoactivation of Cytotoxic Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Successful photoactivation of proteins in mammalian cells is reported. We use a photocaged&#8208;intein (shown in yellow and pink respectively) to deactivate the protein of interest (shown in grey) and we deliver this construct to mammalian cells to activate it in&#8197;vivo using light (active protein shown in red and light in blue). In this work we achieved photocontrol of strong cytotoxic proteins in cancer cells, describing a possible new generation of protein therapeutics.







Abstract
Protein therapeutics offer exquisite selectivity in targeting cellular processes and behaviors, but are rarely used against non&#8208;cell surface targets due to their poor cellular uptake. While cell&#8208;penetrating peptides can be used to deliver recombinant proteins to the cytosol, it is generally difficult to selectively deliver active proteins to target cells. Here, we report a recombinantly produced, intracellular protein delivery and targeting platform that uses a photocaged intein to regulate the spatio&#8208;temporal activation of protein activity in selected cells upon irradiation with light. The platform was successfully demonstrated for two cytotoxic proteins to selectively kill cancer cells after photoactivation of intein splicing. This platform can generically be applied to any protein whose activity can be disrupted by a fused intein, allowing it to underpin a wide variety of future protein therapeutics.

         <title>Combination of Immunotherapy and Photo&#8208;pyroptosis as Novel Anticancer Strategy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyroptosis is programmed cell death, and can significantly improve the immunogenicity of tumors and enhance the effect of anticancer drugs. Designing pyroptosis&#8208;inducing photosensitizers open a novel anticancer strategy. Photodynamic immunotherapy provides a new way to fight against cancer.







Abstract
Immunotherapy has made great progress in clinical cancer treatment in recent years, but its therapeutic efficacy is significantly limited by the lack of immunogenicity in the tumor microenvironment. Pyroptosis is a type of programmed cell death in which the dying cancer cells produce inflammatory cytokines to relieve the immuno&#8208;suppressive microenvironment and thus increase anti&#8208;tumor immunity. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during photodynamic therapy (PDT) are one of the efficient activators that induce pyroptosis. Recently, a few photosensitizers have emerged with the ability to induce immunogenic cancer cell death via pyroptosis, opening a new field for PDT. This highlight introduces the latest research on antitumor strategies achieved by the combination of immunotherapy and photodynamic therapy through photo&#8208;pyroptosis.

         <title>N4&#8208;Allyldeoxycytidine: A New DNA Tag with Chemical Sequencing Power for Pinpointing Labelling Sites, Mapping Epigenetic Markers, and In Situ Imaging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N4&#8208;allyldeoxycytidine (a4dC) can be encoded into DNA as regular deoxycytidine and decoded as mutant bases upon chemical sequencing. We explored the applications of the a4dC tag the in identification of DNA labelling sites, mapping epigenetic DNA marker N4&#8208;methyldeoxycytidine, and fixing and imaging of DNA in&#8197;situ.







Abstract
DNA tagging with base analogues has found numerous applications. To precisely record the DNA labelling information, it would be highly beneficial to develop chemical sequencing tags that can be encoded into DNA as regular bases and decoded as mutant bases following a mild, efficient and bioorthogonal chemical treatment. Here we reported such a DNA tag, N4&#8208;allyldeoxycytidine (a4dC), for labeling and identifying DNA by in&#8197;vitro assays. The iodination of a4dC led to fast and complete formation of 3, N4&#8208;cyclized deoxycytidine, which induced base misincorporation during DNA replication and thus could be located at single base resolution. We explored the applications of a4dC in pinpointing DNA labelling sites at single base resolution, mapping epigenetic marker N4&#8208;methyldeoxycytidine, and imaging nucleic acids in&#8197;situ. In addition, mammalian cellular DNA could be metabolically labelled with a4dC. Our study sheds light on the design of next generation DNA tags with chemical sequencing power.

         <title>The Structure&#8208;Function Relationship of Human Bleomycin Hydrolase: Mutation of a Cysteine Protease into a Serine Protease</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Human bleomycin hydrolase (hBH) switches from a cysteine protease to a serine protease that selectively reacts with the primary amide of bleomycins (BLMs) but is unable to cleave the secondary amide of hBH C&#8208;terminus.







Abstract
Human bleomycin hydrolase (hBH) catalyzes deamidation of the anticancer drug bleomycins (BLM). This enzyme is involved in BLM detoxification and drug resistance. Herein, we report the putative BLM&#8208;binding site and catalytic mechanism of hBH. The crystal structures and biochemical studies suggest that hBH cleaves its C&#8208;terminal residue without significant preference for the type of amino acid, and therefore can accordingly accommodate the &#946;&#8208;aminoalanine amide moiety of BLM for deamidation. Interestingly, hBH is capable of switching from a cysteine protease to a serine protease that is unable to cleave the secondary amide of hBH C&#8208;terminus but reacts with the primary amide of BLMs.

         <title>Second coordination sphere effects on the mechanistic pathways for dioxygen activation by a ferritin: involvement of a Tyr radical and the identification of a cation binding site</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferritins are ubiquitous diiron enzymes involved in iron(II) detoxification and oxidative stress responses and can act as metabolic iron stores. The overall reaction mechanisms of ferritin enzymes are still unclear, particularly concerning the role of the conserved, near catalytic center Tyr residue. Thus, we carried out a computational study of a ferritin using a large cluster model of well over 300 atoms including its first&#8208; and second&#8208;coordination sphere. The calculations reveal important insight into the structure and reactivity of ferritins. Specifically, the active site Tyr residue delivers a proton and electron in the catalytic cycle prior to iron(II) oxidation. In addition, the calculations highlight a likely cation binding site at Asp65, which through long&#8208;range electrostatic interactions, influences the electronic configuration and charge distributions of the metal center. The results are consistent with experimental observations but reveal novel detail of early mechanistic steps that lead to an unusual mixed&#8208;valent iron(III)&#8208;iron(II) center.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoaffinity Labeling&#8208;Based Chemoproteomic Strategy Reveals RBBP4 as a Cellular Target of Protopanaxadiol against Colorectal Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
HCT116 cells were treated with the cell permeable probe AD&#8208;PPD, and irradiated with UV in&#8197;situ. Labelled proteomes were further conjugated to biotin&#8208;PEG3&#8208;azide via click chemistry, and the target of protopanaxadiol (PPD) was identified as RBBP4 by LC&#8208;MS/MS analysis.







Abstract
Protopanaxadiol (PPD), a main ginseng metabolite, exerts powerful anticancer effects against multiple types of cancer; however, its cellular targets remain elusive. Here, we synthesized a cell&#8208;permeable PPD probe via introducing a bifunctional alkyne&#8208;containing diazirine photo&#8208;crosslinker and performed a photoaffinity labeling&#8208;based chemoproteomic study. We identified retinoblastoma binding protein 4 (RBBP4), a chromatin remodeling factor, as an essential cellular target of PPD in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. PPD significantly decreased RBBP4&#8208;dependent trimethylation at lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3), a crucial epigenetic marker that correlates with histologic signs of colorectal cancer aggressiveness, and PPD inhibition of proliferation and migration of HCT116 cells was antagonized by RBBP4 RNA silencing. Collectively, our study highlights a previously undisclosed anti&#8208;colorectal cancer cellular target of the ginseng metabolite and advances the fundamental understanding of RBBP4 functions via a chemical biology strategy.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Isolation and Characterization of High Purity Mammalian Melanin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 9, May 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quantitative, chemoenzymatic process was developed to isolate eumelanin from mammalian tissues using a fluorescent and electron microscopic screen for guidance. This multi&#8208;step process enables quantitative isolation high purity melanin from mammalian tissue for structural studies as demonstrated by solid&#8208;state NMR analyses.







Abstract
Although melanin is one of the most ubiquitous polymers in living systems, our understanding of its molecular structure, biosynthesis and biophysical properties has been limited to only a small number of organisms other than humans. This is in part due to the difficulty associated with isolating pure melanin. While purification methods exist, they typically involve harsh treatments with strong acid/base conditions combined with elevated temperatures that can lead to the polymer backbone degradation. To be successful, a viable isolation method must deliver a selective, yet complete degradation of non&#8208;melanin biopolymers as well as remove small molecule metabolites that are not integrative to the melanin backbone. Here, we demonstrate the use of chemoenzymatic processing guided by fluorescent probes for the purification and isolation of native mammalian melanin without significant induction of chemical degradation. This multi&#8208;step purification&#8208;tracking methodology enables quantitative isolation of pure melanin from mammalian tissue for spectroscopic characterization.

Synthesis of functionalized &#948;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto esters using Chan's diene and modified Mukaiyama&#8208;aldol reaction conditions. Diastereoselective reduction to syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;diols and saponification yielded the respective acids. All synthesized compounds were evaluated for their 5&#8208;lipoxygenase activity.







Abstract
&#948;&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto esters and &#948;,&#946;&#8208;dihydroxy esters are characteristic structural motifs of statin&#8208;type natural products and drug candidates. Here, we describe the synthesis of functionalized &#948;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto esters in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities using Chan's diene and modified Mukaiyama&#8208;aldol reaction conditions. Diastereoselective reduction of &#948;,&#946;&#8208;dihydroxy esters afforded the respective syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;diols, and saponification yielded the corresponding acids. All products were evaluated for their anti&#8208;inflammatory properties, which uncovered a surprising structure&#8208;activity relationship.

         <title>Carving the Active Site of CYP153A7 Monooxygenase for Improving Terminal Hydroxylation of Medium&#8208;Chain Fatty Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 9, May 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Make activation of C&#8208;H bond feasible: Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) catalyze the terminal hydroxylation of fatty acids to form &#969;&#8208;hydroxy fatty acids. To date, available P450s for the terminal hydroxylation of fatty acids stalls at CYP153A subfamily members, which have the limitation of low activity and poor thermostability. We, therefore, adopted directed evolution to generate P450pyr mutants with higher catalytic efficiency toward medium&#8208;chain fatty acids. The results show that mutants toward C6&#8722;C12 fatty acids display improved analytical yields of &#969;&#8208;hydroxy fatty acids.







Abstract
The P450&#8208;mediated terminal hydroxylation of non&#8208;activated C&#8722;H bonds is a chemically challenging reaction. CYP153A7 monooxygenase, discovered in Sphingomonas sp. HXN200, belongs to the CYP153A subfamily and shows a pronounced terminal selectivity. Herein, we report the significantly improved terminal hydroxylation activity of CYP153A7 by redesign of the substrate binding pocket based on molecular docking of CYP153A7&#8722;C8:0 and sequence alignments. Some of the resultant single mutants were advantageous over the wild&#8208;type enzyme with higher reaction rates, achieving a complete conversion of n&#8208;octanoic acid (C8:0, 1&#8197;mM) in a shorter time period. Especially, a single&#8208;mutation variant, D258E, showed 3.8&#8208;fold higher catalytic efficiency than the wild type toward the terminal hydroxylation of medium&#8208;chain fatty acid C8:0 to the high value&#8208;added product 8&#8208;hydroxyoctanoic acid.

         <title>CRISPR&#8208;Mediated Enzyme Fragment Complementation Assay for Quantification of the Stability of Splice Isoforms</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 9, May 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CRISPR&#8208;mediated enzyme fragment complementation (EFC) assay targeting exon 7 of the survival of motor neuron 2 (SMN2) gene was developed. The EFC assay is compatible with 384&#8208;well plates and robustly quantified the splicing modulation activity of small molecules.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule splicing modulators exemplified by an FDA&#8208;approved drug, risdiplam, are a new pharmacological modality for regulating the expression and stability of splice isoforms. We report a CRISPR&#8208;mediated enzyme fragment complementation (EFC) assay to quantify the splice isoform stability. The EFC assay harnessed a 42 amino acid split of a &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (designate &#945;&#8208;tag), which could be fused at the termini of the target genes using CRISPR/cas9. The &#945;&#8208;tagged splice isoform would be quantified by measuring the enzymatic activity upon complementation with the rest of &#946;&#8208;galactosidase. This EFC assay retained all the sequences of introns and exons of the target gene in the native genomic environment that recapitulates the cell biology of the diseases of interest. For a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we developed a CRISPR&#8208;mediated EFC assay targeting the exon 7 of the survival of motor neuron 2 (SMN2) gene. The EFC assay is compatible with 384&#8208;well plates and robustly quantified the splicing modulation activity of small molecules. In this study, we also discovered that a coumarin derivative, compound 4, potently modulated SMN2 exon 7 splicing at as low as 1.1&#8197;nM.

         <title>Inhibiting Erastin&#8208;Induced Ferroptotic Cell Death by Purine&#8208;Based Chelators</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 9, May 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Purine derivatives were synthesized and were explored for ferroptosis inhibition via iron chelation and showed effective iron chelation with 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 (ligand&#8201;:&#8201;metal) stoichiometry. One compound (2) in particular showed better activity than the known iron chelator and ferroptosis inhibitor AS8351.







Abstract
Ferroptosis is a cell death event caused by increased lipid peroxidation leading to iron&#8208;dependent oxidative stress and is associated with a wide variety of diseases. In recent years, ferroptosis inhibition has emerged as a novel strategy to target different pathologies. Here, we report the synthesis of two purine derivatives, 1 and 2, for iron chelation strategy and evaluate their potency to inhibit erastin&#8208;induced ferroptosis. Both compounds showed efficient iron chelation in solution as well as in cellular environment. The crystal structure of the purine derivatives with iron demonstrated a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 (ligand to metal center) stoichiometry for iron and purine derivative complexation. The synthesized compounds also decrease the reactive oxygen species concentration in cell cultures. Compound 2 showed better potency towards the prevention of ferroptotic cell death as compared to commercially available iron chelator in the erastin&#8208;induced ferroptosis cell culture model. Such purine analogues are potential functional scaffolds for the development of target molecules for ferroptosis inhibition.

Here, we report the synthesis of two purine derivatives, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, for iron chelation strategy and evaluate their potency to inhibit erastin-induced ferroptosis. Both compounds showed efficient iron chelation in solution as well as in cellular environment. The crystal structure of the purine derivatives with iron demonstrated a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 (ligand to metal center) stoichiometry for iron and purine derivative complexation. The synthesized compounds also decrease the reactive oxygen species concentration in cell cultures. Compound &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; showed better potency towards the prevention of ferroptotic cell death as compared to commercially available iron chelator in the erastin-induced ferroptosis cell culture model. Such purine analogues are potential functional scaffolds for the development of target molecules for ferroptosis inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Catalytic Mechanism of Pdx2 Glutaminase Driven by a Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Glu Triad: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 9, May 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 was studied with atomic detail employing the computational ONIOM hybrid QM/MM methodology. The results show that the catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 occurs in six steps that can be divided into four stages. These results can be used for the synthesis of new transition state analogue inhibitors capable of inhibiting Pdx2 and impair diseases like Malaria and Tuberculosis.







Abstract
The catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 was studied with atomic detail employing the computational ONIOM hybrid QM/MM methodology. Pdx2 employs a Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Glu catalytic triad to deaminate glutamine to glutamate and ammonia &#8211; the source of the nitrogen of pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP). This enzyme is, therefore, a rate&#8208;limiting step in the PLP biosynthetic pathway of Malaria and Tuberculosis pathogens that rely on this mechanism to obtain PLP. For this reason, Pdx2 is considered a novel and promising drug target to treat these diseases. The results obtained show that the catalytic mechanism of Pdx2 occurs in six steps that can be divided into four stages: (i)&#8197;activation of Cys87, (ii)&#8197;deamination of glutamine with the formation of the glutamyl&#8208;thioester intermediate, (iii)&#8197;hydrolysis of the formed intermediate, and (iv)&#8197;enzymatic turnover. The kinetic data available in the literature (19.1&#8211;19.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) agree very well with the calculated free energy barrier of the hydrolytic step (18.2&#8197;kcal.mol&#8722;11), which is the rate&#8208;limiting step of the catalytic process when substrate is readily available in the active site. This catalytic mechanism differs from other known amidases in three main points: i)&#8197;it requires the activation of the nucleophile Cys87 to a thiolate; ii)&#8197;the hydrolysis occurs in a single step and therefore does not require the formation of a second tetrahedral reaction intermediate, as it is proposed, and iii) Glu198 does not have a direct role in the catalytic process. Together, these results can be used for the synthesis of new transition state analogue inhibitors capable of inhibiting Pdx2 and impair diseases like Malaria and Tuberculosis.

         <title>Switchable DNA&#8208;Based Peroxidases Controlled by a Chaotropic Ion**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 9, May 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chaotropic anion perchlorate selectively destabilizes guanine&#8208;rich double stranded DNA, allowing it to form a G&#8208;quadruplex that can complex with hemin, forming a peroxidase DNAzyme. This affords a pH&#8208; and ATP&#8208;independent means of switching DNA secondary structure and controlling electron&#8208;transfer reactions.







Abstract
Here we demonstrate a switchable DNA electron&#8208;transfer catalyst, enabled by selective destabilization of secondary structure by the denaturant, perchlorate. The system is comprised of two strands, one of which can be selectively switched between a G&#8208;quadruplex and duplex or single&#8208;stranded conformations. In the G&#8208;quadruplex state, it binds hemin, enabling peroxidase activity. This switching ability arises from our finding that perchlorate, a chaotropic Hofmeister ion, selectively destabilizes duplex over G&#8208;quadruplex DNA. By varying perchlorate concentration, we show that the DNA structure can be switched between states that do and do not catalyze electron&#8208;transfer catalysis. State switching can be achieved in three ways: thermally, by dilution, or by concentration.

         <title>Fermentative Production of Halogenated Tryptophan Derivatives with Corynebacterium glutamicum Overexpressing Tryptophanase or Decarboxylase Genes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 9, May 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tryptophan overproducing Corynebacterium glutamicum strain was metabolically engineered to produce 7&#8208;Br/Cl&#8208;indole and 7&#8208;Br/Cl&#8208;tryptamine. For this purpose, tryptophanases and aromatic l&#8208;amino acid decarboxylases from different origins were screened and utilized in combination with halogenase RebH. Fermentative production of 7&#8208;Br&#8208;tryptamine in a bioreactor resulted in a product titer of 0.36&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1.







Abstract
The aromatic amino acid l&#8208;tryptophan serves as a precursor for many valuable compounds such as neuromodulators, indoleamines and indole alkaloids. In this work, tryptophan biosynthesis was extended by halogenation followed by decarboxylation to the respective tryptamines or cleavage to the respective indoles. Either the tryptophanase genes tnaAs from E. coli and Proteus vulgaris or the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase genes AADCs from Bacillus atrophaeus, Clostridium sporogenes, and Ruminococcus gnavus were expressed in Corynebacterium glutamicum strains producing (halogenated) tryptophan. Regarding indoles, final titers of 16&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 7&#8208;Cl&#8208;indole and 23&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 7&#8208;Br&#8208;indole were attained. Tryptamine production led to a much higher titer of 2.26&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 upon expression of AADC from B. atrophaeus. AADC enzymes were shown to be active with halogenated tryptophan in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo and supported production of 0.36&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 7&#8208;Br&#8208;tryptamine with a volumetric productivity of 8.3&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in a fed&#8208;batch fermentation.

         <title>A Major Shell Protein of 1,2&#8208;Propanediol Utilization Microcompartment Conserves the Activity of Its Signature Enzyme at Higher Temperatures</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 9, May 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chaperon&#8208;like behavior of the shell protein PduBB&#8217; towards the native enzyme PduCDE was studied. The shell protein PduBB&#8217; was found to interact with the enzyme PduCDE and protect it from temperature&#8208;induced denaturation. It also preserved its catalytic activity during thermal stress.







Abstract
A classic example of an all&#8208;protein natural nano&#8208;bioreactor, the bacterial microcompartment is a prokaryotic organelle that confines enzymes in a small volume enveloped by an outer protein shell. These protein compartments metabolize specific organic molecules, allowing bacteria to survive in restricted nutrient environments. In this work, 1,2&#8208;propanediol utilization microcompartment (PduMCP) was used as a model to study the effect of molecular confinement on the stability and catalytic activity of native enzymes in the microcompartment. A combination of enzyme assays, spectroscopic techniques, binding assays, and computational analysis were used to evaluate the impact of the major shell protein PduBB&#8242; on the stability and activity of PduMCP&#8242;s signature enzyme, dioldehydratase PduCDE. While free PduCDE shows &#8764;45&#8201;% reduction in its optimum activity (activity at 37&#8201;&#176;C) when exposed to a temperature of 45&#8201;&#176;C, it retains similar activity up to 50&#8201;&#176;C when encapsulated within PduMCP. PduBB&#8242;, a major component of the outer shell of PduMCP, preserves the catalytic efficiency of PduCDE under thermal stress and prevents temperature&#8208;induced unfolding and aggregation of PduCDE in&#8197;vitro. We observed that while both PduB and PduB&#8242; interact with the enzyme with micromolar affinity, only the PduBB&#8242; combination influences its activity and stability, highlighting the importance of the unique PduBB&#8242; combination in the functioning of PduMCP.

In this work, 1,2-propanediol utilization microcompartment (PduMCP) was used as a model to study the effect of molecular confinement on the stability and catalytic activity of native enzymes in the microcompartment. A combination of enzyme assays, spectroscopic techniques, binding assays, and computational analysis were used to evaluate the impact of the major shell protein PduBB&#8242; on the stability and activity of PduMCP&#8242;s signature enzyme, dioldehydratase PduCDE. While free PduCDE shows &#8764;45&#8201;% reduction in its optimum activity (activity at 37&#8201;&#176;C) when exposed to a temperature of 45&#8201;&#176;C, it retains similar activity up to 50&#8201;&#176;C when encapsulated within PduMCP. PduBB&#8242;, a major component of the outer shell of PduMCP, preserves the catalytic efficiency of PduCDE under thermal stress and prevents temperature-induced unfolding and aggregation of PduCDE &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt;. We observed that while both PduB and PduB&#8242; interact with the enzyme with micromolar affinity, only the PduBB&#8242; combination influences its activity and stability, highlighting the importance of the unique PduBB&#8242; combination in the functioning of PduMCP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Delivery of Toluidine Blue (TB) to DNA in the form of TB&#8208;surfactant ionic pair occurs in the pre&#8208;micellar stage of the surfactant, in contrast to the no transfer of TB molecules to DNA in the micellar stage.







Abstract
Drug delivery to a target without adverse effects is one of the major criteria for clinical use. Herein, we have made an attempt to explore the delivery efficacy of SDS surfactant in a monomer and micellar stage during the delivery of the model drug, Toluidine Blue (TB) from the micellar cavity to DNA. Molecular recognition of pre&#8208;micellar SDS encapsulated TB with DNA occurs at a rate constant of k1 &#8764;652&#8197;s&#8722;1. However, no significant release of encapsulated TB at micellar concentration was observed within the experimental time frame. This originated from the higher binding affinity of TB towards the nano&#8208;cavity of SDS at micellar concentration which does not allow the delivery of TB from the nano&#8208;cavity of SDS micelles to DNA. Thus, molecular recognition controls the extent of DNA recognition by TB which in turn modulates the rate of delivery of TB from SDS in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner.

One scaffold &#8211; different organelle sensors: The structure&#8208;organelle relationship (SOR) of an important synthetic intermediate targeting the nucleus and its transformation into other pH&#8208;activable fluorescent probes is demonstrated. The fluorescent probes were synthesized using a single synthetic route. As shown in the cover picture, the assembly line illustrates that a common synthetic intermediate (rectangle shape) was transformed into another molecule (triangle or hexagonal shape) in a one&#8208;step reaction to target specific cell organelles in live microglial cells. The common intermediate targets the cell nucleus, the cationic probe targets mitochondria, whereas the amine&#8208;containing probe with pH&#8208;activable property targets acidic lysosomes. The graphic was created by Ryann Davis. More information can be found in the Communication by G. Chopra et&#8197;al.

         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 9, May 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomistic description of Pdx2 catalytic mechanism is provided by QM/MM methodologies. Pdx2, the glutaminase subunit of pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP) synthase, is characterized by a Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Glu catalytic triad used to deaminate glutamine to glutamate. While being absent in humans, Pdx2 is essential for the development and replication of the protozoan Plasmodium falciparum and Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogens, which are responsible for two deadly diseases, malaria and tuberculosis, respectively. Pdx2 is thus a promising drug target for fighting these diseases. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A.&#8197;F. Pina et&#8197;al.

         <title>Extension of the Terpene Chemical Space: the Very First Biosynthetic Steps</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 9, May 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to a unique biosynthetic scheme, the diversification of terpene structure could be envisioned through the structural modification of the two universal common terpene precursors IPP and DMAPP. This minireview covers the synthesis, the use as prenyl transferase substrates, and the synthetic application of IPP and DMAPP homologues developed for diversifying the terpene chemical space.







Abstract
The structural diversity of terpenes is particularly notable and many studies are carried out to increase it further. In the terpene biosynthetic pathway this diversity is accessible from only two common precursors, i.&#8201;e. isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). Methods recently developed (e.&#8201;g. the Terpene Mini Path) have allowed DMAPP and IPP to be obtained from a two&#8208;step enzymatic conversion of industrially available isopentenol (IOH) and dimethylallyl alcohol (DMAOH) into their corresponding diphosphates. Easily available IOH and DMAOH analogues then offer quick access to modified terpenoids thus avoiding the tedious chemical synthesis of unnatural diphosphates. The aim of this minireview is to cover the literature devoted to the use of these analogues for widening the accessible terpene chemical space.

         <title>Bioinorganic Chemistry of Zinc in Relation to the Immune System</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 9, May 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc's role in human immunity has been extensively covered from a biological perspective. The structural, thermodynamic, and inorganic chemistry of zinc in relation to proteins and pathways of the immune system has received less attention and is the topic of the present review.







Abstract
Zinc is well&#8208;known to have a central role in human inflammation and immunity and is itself an anti&#8208;inflammatory and antiviral agent. Despite its massively documented role in such processes, the underlying chemistry of zinc in relation to specific proteins and pathways of the immune system has not received much focus. This short review provides an overview of this topic, with emphasis on the structures of key proteins, zinc coordination chemistry, and probable mechanisms involved in zinc&#8208;based immunity, with some focus points for future chemical and biological research.

         <title>DNA Origami&#8208;Based Protein Manipulation Systems: From Function Regulation to Biological Application</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 9, May 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA origami creates an ideal operation panel for positioning and manipulating individual proteins with nanoscale precision. This review provides an overview of the existing DNA origami&#8208;based protein manipulation systems for protein function regulation and biological applications.







Abstract
Proteins directly participate in tremendous physiological processes and mediate a variety of cellular functions. However, precise manipulation of proteins with predefined relative position and stoichiometry for understanding protein&#8208;protein interactions and guiding cellular behaviors is still challenging. With superior programmability of DNA molecules, DNA origami technology is able to construct arbitrary nanostructures that can accurately control the arrangement of proteins with various functionalities to solve these problems. Herein, starting from the classification of DNA origami nanostructures and the category of assembled proteins, we summarize the existing DNA origami&#8208;based protein manipulation systems (PMSs), review the advances on the regulation of their functions, and discuss their applications in cellular behavior modulation and disease therapy. Moreover, the limitations and potential directions of DNA origami&#8208;based PMSs are also presented, which may offer guidance for rational construction and ingenious application.

         <title>Challenges of the Omicron (B.1.1.529) Variant and Its Lineages: A Global Perspective</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 9, May 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is continuously mutating and is regularly re&#8208;emerging. The recently emerged Omicron variant shows high rates of mutation at the spike protein and receptor binding domain regions. Because of these mutations, the Omicron variant has been noted to have the highest transmissibility among the previous SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants including the Delta variant. Given Omicron's high genetic variability, it demonstrates immune escape mechanisms that potentially negate vaccine protection and causes re&#8208;infections. Therefore, variant&#8208;specific monoclonal antibodies, drugs, and vaccines are required to counter the pandemic.







Abstract
The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus has shown increased ability to mutate over the past two years, especially in the regions of the spike protein and receptor binding sites. Omicron (B.1.1.529) is the fifth variant of concern (VOC) after the emergence of the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta VOCs of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. This new variant has now circulated in 128 countries and according to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), these 128 countries have shared 650,657 Omicron genome sequences as of 26 January, 2022. In this article, we highlight the real challenges of Omicron and its different lineages.

         <title>One Scaffold, Different Organelle Sensors: pH&#8208;Activable Fluorescent Probes for Targeting Live Microglial Cell Organelles**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 23, Issue 9, May 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
How can a common synthetic intermediate be transformed by different functional groups to target different cell organelles? We evaluated the structure&#8208;organelle&#8208;relationship (SOR) of pH&#8208;activable fluorescent probes synthesized from the same synthetic intermediate to target nuclei, lysosomes, and mitochondria in live microglial cells.







Abstract
Targeting live cell organelles is essential for imaging, understanding, and controlling specific biochemical processes. Typically, fluorescent probes with distinct structural scaffolds are used to target specific cell organelles. Here, we have designed a modular one&#8208;step synthetic strategy using a common reaction intermediate to develop new lysosomal, mitochondrial, and nucleus&#8208;targeting pH&#8208;activable fluorescent probes that are all based on a single boron dipyrromethane scaffold. The divergent cell organelle targeting was achieved by synthesizing probes with specific functional group changes to the central scaffold resulting in differential fluorescence and pKa. Specifically, we show that the functional group transformation of the same scaffold influences cellular localization and specificity of pH&#8208;activable fluorescent probes in live primary microglial cells with pKa values ranging from &#8764;3.2&#8211;6.0. We introduce a structure&#8208;organelle&#8208;relationship (SOR) framework to target nuclei (NucShine), lysosomes (LysoShine), and mitochondria (MitoShine) in live microglia. This work will result in future applications of SOR beyond imaging to target and control organelle&#8208;specific biochemical processes in disease&#8208;specific models.

         <title>Hybrid Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of C7&#8208;Sugars for Molecular Evidence of in vivo Shikimate Pathway Inhibition</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of distinctive chemical synthesis strategies aims to most efficient routes towards versatile compounds in drug target studies. Here, we establish a powerful hybrid synthetic approach of total chemical and chemoenzymatic synthesis to efficiently obtain various 7&#8208;deoxy&#8208;sedoheptulose (7dSh, 1) analogues, unique C7 sugars for structure activity relationship studies. 7dSh (1) is a rare microbial sugar with in planta herbicidal activity. As natural antimetabolite of 3&#8208;dehydroquinate synthase (DHQS), 7dSh (1) inhibits the shikimate pathway, which is essential for the synthesis of aromatic amino acids in bacteria, fungi and plants, but absent in mammals. As glyphosate, the most used chemical herbicide faces restrictions worldwide, DHQS has gained more attention as valid target of herbicides and antimicrobial agents. In vitro and in vivo analyses of the C7&#8208;deoxysugars confirm DHQS as enzymatic target, highlight the crucial role of uptake for inhibition and add molecular aspects to target mechanism studies of C7&#8208;sugars as our contribution to global efforts for alternative weed control strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein&#8211;protein Recognition Involved in the Intermodular Transacylation Reaction in Modular Polyketide Synthase in the Biosynthesis of Vicenistatin</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ketosynthase (KS) domain is a core domain found in modular polyketide synthases (PKSs). To maintain the polyketide biosynthetic fidelity, the KS domain must only accept an acyl group from the acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain of the immediate upstream module even when they are separated into different polypeptides. Although it was reported that both the docking domain&#8208;based interactions and KS&#8211;ACP compatibility are important for the interpolypeptide transacylation reaction in 6&#8208;deoxyerythronolide B synthases, it is not clear whether these findings are broadly applied to other modular PKSs. Herein, we describe the importance of protein&#8211;protein recognition in the intermodular transacylation between VinP1 module 3 and VinP2 module 4 in vicenistatin biosynthesis. We compared the transacylation activity and crosslinking efficiency of VinP2 KS  4  &#160;against the cognate VinP1 ACP  3  &#160;with the noncognate one. As a result, it appeared that VinP2 KS  4  &#160;distinguishes the cognate ACP  3  &#160;from other ACPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Click Bioconjugation &#8211; Modifying Proteins using Click&#8208;Like Chemistry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:
Bioconjugation is dealing with the chemical modification of proteins. The reactions used exploit either the intrinsic chemical reactivity of the biomolecule or introduce functionalities that can then be subsequently reacted without interfering with other functional groups of the biological entity. Perfectly selective, high yielding chemical transformations are needed that can be run in aqueous environment at mild pH conditions. Requirements that have an obvious overlap with the definition of click chemistry. This review shows a selection of successfully applied click&#8208;type reactions in bioconjugation as well as some recent developments to broaden the chemical toolbox to meet the challenge of a selective, bioorthogonal modification of biomolecules.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The advent of DNA nanotechnology has paved the way for the development of nanoscale robotics capable of executing smart and sophisticated tasks in a programmed and automatic manner. The programmability and customizable functionality of designer DNA nanorobots interfacing with biology would offer great potential for basic and applied research in the interdisciplinary fields of chemistry, biology, and medicine. This minireview aims to summarize the latest progress in designer DNA nanorobotics enabling programmable functions. We first describe the state&#8208;of&#8208;art engineering principles and the functional modules used in the rational design of a dynamic DNA nanorobot. Subsequently, we summarize the distinct types of DNA nanorobots performing sensing tasks, sensing&#8208;and&#8208;actuation, or continuous actuation, highlighting the versatility of designer DNA nanorobots in accurate biosensing, targeted drug delivery, and autonomous molecular operations to promote desired cellular behavior. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in the development of functional DNA nanorobotics for biomedical applications. We envision that significant progress in DNA&#8208;enabled nanorobotics with programmable functions will improve precision medicine in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Modifications for a Next Generation of Nucleic Acid Aptamers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cubane aptamer (cubamer) is a chemically modified nucleic acid aptamer incorporating cubane moieties into the nucleotide bases. The Figure shows a cubamer in complex with the malaria biomarker Plasmodium vivax lactate dehydrogenase (PvLDH), with high specificity relative to Plasmodium falciparum lactate dehydrogenase (PfLDH). Such specificity has not been possible with conventional DNA aptamers. This example demonstrates the enhanced functionality of modified aptamers. Herein, we review the chemistry, synthesis, selection, and application of such modified aptamers.







Abstract
In the past three decades, in&#8197;vitro systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) has yielded many aptamers for translational applications in both research and clinical settings. Despite their promise as an alternative to antibodies, the low success rate of SELEX (&#8764;30&#8201;%) has been a major bottleneck that hampers the further development of aptamers. One hurdle is the lack of chemical diversity in nucleic acids. To address this, the aptamer chemical repertoire has been extended by introducing exotic chemical groups, which provide novel binding functionalities. This review will focus on how modified aptamers can be selected and evolved, with illustration of some successful examples. In particular, unique chemistries are exemplified. Various strategies of incorporating modified building blocks into the standard SELEX protocol are highlighted, with a comparison of the differences between pre&#8208;SELEX and post&#8208;SELEX modifications. Nucleic acid aptamers with extended functionality evolved from non&#8208;natural chemistries will open up new vistas for function and application of nucleic acids.

         <title>Crucial Role of the Chaperonin GroES/EL for Heterologous Production of the Soluble Methane Monooxygenase from Methylomonas methanica MC09</title>

Methane monooxygenase: The chaperonin GroES/EL enables folding and correct assembly of soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) heterologously produced in Escherichia coli. The production of recombinant sMMO will enable a variety of novel biotechnological applications in future.







Abstract
Methane is a widespread energy source and can serve as an attractive C1 building block for a future bioeconomy. The soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) is able to break the strong C&#8722;H bond of methane and convert it to methanol. The high structural complexity, multiplex cofactors, and unfamiliar folding or maturation procedures of sMMO have hampered the heterologous production and thus biotechnological applications. Here, we demonstrate the heterologous production of active sMMO from the marine Methylomonas methanica MC09 in Escherichia coli by co&#8208;synthesizing the GroES/EL chaperonin. Iron determination, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and native gel immunoblots revealed the incorporation of the non&#8208;heme diiron centre and homodimer formation of active sMMO. The production of recombinant sMMO will enable the expansion of the possibilities of detailed studies, allowing for a variety of novel biotechnological applications.

         <title>Synthesis of 6,6&#8208; and 7,7&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1&#8208;acetamidopyrrolizidines and their oxidation catalyzed by the nonheme Fe oxygenase LolO</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>LolO, a 2&#8208;oxoglutarate&#8208;dependent nonheme Fe oxygenase, catalyzes both the hydroxylation and cycloetherification of 1&#8208;  exo  &#8208;acetamidopyrrolizidine (AcAP), a pathway intermediate in the biosynthesis of the loline alkaloids. We have prepared fluorinated AcAP analogs to aid in continued mechanistic investigation of the unusual LolO&#8208;catalyzed cycloetherification step. LolO was able to first hydroxylate and then cycloetherify 6,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;AcAP (prepared from  N  ,  O  &#8208;protected 4&#8208;oxoproline), forming a difluorinated analog of  N  &#8208;acetylnorloline (NANL) and providing evidence for a cycloetherification mechanism involving a C(7) radical as opposed to a C(7) carbocation. By contrast, LolO was able to hydroxylate 7,7&#8208;difluoro&#8208;AcAP (prepared from 3&#8208;oxoproline) but failed to cycloetherify it, forming (1  R  , 2  R  , 8  S  )&#8208;7,7&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;AcAP as the sole product. Because it completely blocks the cycloetherification step, 7,7&#8208;difluoro&#8208;AcAP has the potential to become an important tool for accumulating and characterizing the LolO intermediate responsible for catalyzing cycloetherification of 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;AcAP.</dc:description>

         <title>Assessment of Bioactivity&#8208;Modulating Pseudo&#8208;Ring Formation in Psilocin and Related Tryptamines</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Psilocybin (  1  ) is the major alkaloid found in psychedelic mushrooms and acts as a prodrug to psilocin (  2  , 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;  N  ,  N  &#8208;dimethyltryptamine), a potent psychedelic that exerts remarkable alteration of human consciousness. In contrast, the positional isomer bufotenin (  7  , 5&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;  N  ,  N  &#8208;dimethyltryptamine) differs significantly in its reported pharmacology. A series of experiments were designed to explore chemical differences between  2  and  7  and specifically to test the hypothesis that the C&#8208;4 hydroxy group of  2  significantly infuences the observed physical and chemical properties through pseudo&#8208;ring formation via an intramolecular hydrogen bond (IMHB). NMR spectroscopy accompanied by quantum chemical calculations was employed to compare hydrogen bond behaviour in 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;hydroxylated tryptamines. The results provide evidence for a pseudo&#8208;ring in  2  and that sidechain/hydroxyl interactions in 4&#8208;hydroxytryptamines influence their oxidation kinetics. We conclude that the propensity to form IMHBs leads to a higher number of uncharged species that easily cross the blood&#8208;brain barrier, compared to  7  and other 5&#8208;hydroxytryptamines, which cannot form IMHBs. Our work helps understand a fundamental aspect of the pharmacology of  2  and should support efforts to introduce it (via the prodrug  1  ) as an urgently needed therapeutic against major depressive disorder.</dc:description>

         <title>A Light&#8208;Activatable Photocaged Variant of the Ultra&#8208;High Affinity ALFA&#8208;Tag Nanobody</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tag control: Photo&#8208;activatable antibodies are a recent addition to the chemical biology toolbox that allow the manipulation of biological processes by antigen&#8208;binding with unprecedented spatiotemporal control. We report the successful extension of our design concept of suitably photocaged nanobodies, termed photobodies, to the first short tag (13 amino acids) binding nanobody, the ultra&#8208;high affinity ALFA nanobody, to open the door for more fine&#8208;tuned control.







Abstract
Nanobodies against short linear peptide&#8208;epitopes are widely used to detect and bind proteins of interest (POI) in fusion constructs. Engineered nanobodies that can be controlled by light have found very recent attention for various extra&#8208; and intracellular applications. We here report the design of a photocaged variant of the ultra&#8208;high affinity ALFA&#8208;tag nanobody, also termed ALFA&#8208;tag photobody. ortho&#8208;Nitrobenzyl tyrosine was incorporated into the paratope region of the nanobody by genetic code expansion technology and resulted in a &#8805;9,200 to 100,000&#8208;fold impairment of the binding affinity. Irradiation with light (365&#8197;nm) leads to decaging and reconstitutes the native nanobody. We show the light&#8208;dependent binding of the ALFA&#8208;tag photobody to HeLa cells presenting the ALFA&#8208;tag. The generation of the first photobody directed against a short peptide epitope underlines the generality of our photobody design concept. We envision that this photobody will be useful for the spatiotemporal control of proteins in many applications using cultured cells.

         <title>Making Enzymes Suitable for Organic Chemistry by Rational Protein Design</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directed evolution of enzymes did not attract the attention of organic chemists until the control of stereoselectivity was successfully achieved 25&#8197;years ago. Traditionally, semi&#8208;rational directed evolution based on focused saturation mutagenesis at sites lining the binding pocket and rational enzyme design were considered to be two different approaches, especially when evolving stereoselectivity. However, because the former has become more and more rational, the two approaches have merged with the development of focused rational iterative site&#8208;specific mutagenesis (FRISM).







Abstract
This review outlines recent developments in protein engineering of stereo&#8208; and regioselective enzymes, which are of prime interest in organic and pharmaceutical chemistry as well as biotechnology. The widespread application of enzymes was hampered for decades due to limited enantio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and regioselectivity, which was the reason why most organic chemists were not interested in biocatalysis. This attitude began to change with the advent of semi&#8208;rational directed evolution methods based on focused saturation mutagenesis at sites lining the binding pocket. Screening constitutes the labor&#8208;intensive step (bottleneck), which is the reason why various research groups are continuing to develop techniques for the generation of small and smart mutant libraries. Rational enzyme design, traditionally an alternative to directed evolution, provides small collections of mutants which require minimal screening. This approach first focused on thermostabilization, and did not enter the field of stereoselectivity until later. Computational guides such as the Rosetta algorithms, HotSpot Wizard metric, and machine learning (ML) contribute significantly to decision making. The newest advancements show that semi&#8208;rational directed evolution such as CAST/ISM and rational enzyme design no longer develop on separate tracks, instead, they have started to merge. Indeed, researchers utilizing the two approaches have learned from each other. Today, the toolbox of organic chemists includes enzymes, primarily because the possibility of controlling stereoselectivity by protein engineering has ensured reliability when facing synthetic challenges. This review was also written with the hope that undergraduate and graduate education will include enzymes more so than in the past.

         <title>An Enantiomeric Fragment Pair (EFP) Approach for the Study of Cellular Uptake of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Studying the cellular uptake of amyloidogenic proteins and peptides poses many challenges derived from the aggregation&#8208;prone nature of the system. We developed an enantiomeric fragment pair (EFP) approach to facilitate the study of the interactions with the cellular environment. The generated fragments are short and soluble, yet retain the biological activity of the full&#8208;length protein. This method allows aggregation&#8208;dependent mechanisms to be discerned from aggregation&#8208;independent mechanisms, and applies stereo&#8208;differentiation as a tool for the identification of receptors involved in cellular uptake of amyloids.







Abstract
This intrinsic nature limits the way amyloids can be studied and increases the level of complexity of the techniques needed to study the system of interest. Recent reports suggest that cellular recognition and internalization of pre&#8208;fibrillary species of amyloidogenic peptides and proteins may initiate some of its toxic actions. Therefore, developing novels tools to facilitate the understanding and determination of the interactions between intrinsically disordered proteins and the cellular membrane is becoming increasingly valuable. Here, we present and propose an approach for the study of the interactions of intrinsically disordered proteins with the cellular surface based on the use of enantiomeric fragment pairs (EFPs). By following a stepwise methodology in which the amyloidogenic peptide or protein is fragmented into specific segments, we show how this approach can be exploited to differentiate between different types of cellular uptake, to determine the degree of receptor&#8208;mediated cellular internalization of intrinsically disordered peptides and proteins, and to pinpoint the specific regions within the amino acid sequence responsible for the cellular recognition. Adopting this approach overcomes aggregation&#8208;related challenges and offers a particularly well&#8208;suited platform for the elucidation of receptor&#8208;intermediated recognition, uptake, and toxicity.

         <dc:description>In nature 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate aldolase (DERA) catalyzes the reversible formation of 2&#8208;deoxyribose 5&#8208;phosphate from D&#8208;glyceraldehyde 3&#8208;phosphate and acetaldehyde. In addition, this enzyme can use acetaldehyde as the sole substrate, resulting in a tandem aldol reaction, yielding 2,4,6&#8208;trideoxy&#8208;D&#8208;erythro&#8208;hexapyranose, which spontaneously cyclizes. This reaction is very useful for the synthesis of the side chain of statin&#8208;type drugs used for decrease cholesterol level in blood. One of the main challenges in the use of DERA in industrial processes, where high substrate loads are needed to achieve the desired productivity, is its inactivation by high acetaldehyde concentration. In this work, the utility of different variants of  Pectobacterium atrosepticum  DERA (  Pa  DERA) as whole cell biocatalysts to synthesize 2&#8208;deoxyribose 5&#8208;phosphate and 2,4,6&#8208;trideoxy&#8208;D&#8208;erythro&#8208;hexapyranose was analyzed. Under optimized conditions,  E. coli  BL21 (  Pa  DERA C&#8208;His AA C49M) whole cells yields 99% of both products. Furthermore, this enzyme is able to tolerate 500 mM acetaldehyde in a whole cell&#8208; experiment what makes it suitable for industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigation of &#946;&#8208;substitution activity of O&#8208;acetylserine sulfhydrolase from Citrullus vulgaris</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyridoxal&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP) dependent enzymes have garnered interest for their ability to synthesize non&#8208;standard amino acids (nsAAs). One such class of enzymes,  O  &#8208;acetylserine sulfhydrylases (OASSs), catalyze the final step in the biosynthesis of l&#8208;cysteine. Here, we examine the &#946;&#8208;substitution capability of the OASS from  Citrullus vulgaris  , a putative l&#8208;mimosine synthase. While the previously reported activity was not reproducible in our hands, we successfully identified non&#8208;native reactivity with a variety of  O&#8208;  nucleophiles.&#160; Optimization of reaction conditions for carboxylate and phenolate substrates led to distinct conditions, that were leveraged for the preparative&#8208;scale synthesis of nsAAs. We further show this enzyme is capable of C&#8208;C bond formation through a Henry&#8208;like reaction. To facilitate understanding of this enzyme, we determined the crystal structure of the enzyme bound to PLP as the internal aldimine at 1.55 &#197;, revealing key features of the active site and providing information that may guide subsequent development of  Cv  OASS as a practical biocatalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of ring modifications on nucleolar stress caused by oxaliplatin&#8208;like compounds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxaliplatin, a platinum compound in broad clinical use, can induce cell death through a nucleolar stress pathway rather than the canonical DNA damage response studied for other Pt(II) compounds. Previous work has found that the oxaliplatin 1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (DACH) ring but not the oxalate leaving group is important to the ability to induce nucleolar stress. Here we study the influence of DACH ring substituents at the 4&#8208;position on the ability of DACH&#8208;Pt(II) compounds to cause nucleolar stress. We determine that DACH&#8208;Pt(II) compounds with 4&#8208;position methyl, ethyl, or propyl substituents induce nucleolar stress, but DACH&#8208;Pt(II) compounds with 4&#8208;isopropyl substituents do not induce nucleolar stress. This effect is independent of whether the substituent is in the axial or equatorial position relatively to the trans diamines of the ligand. These results suggest that spatially sensitive interactions could be involved in the ability of platinum compounds to cause nucleolar stress.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Measurements of the Cobalt&#8208;thiolate Bonds Strength in Rubredoxin by Single&#8208;Molecule Force Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cobalt is a trace transition metal. Although it is not abundant on earth, tens of cobalt&#8208;containing proteins exist in life. Moreover, the characteristic spectrum of Co(II) ion makes it a powerful probe for the characterization of metal&#8208;binding proteins through the formation of cobalt&#8208;ligand bonds. Since most of these natural and artificial cobalt&#8208;containing proteins are stable, we believe that these cobalt&#8208;ligand bonds in the protein system are also mechanically stable. To prove this, we used atomic force microscopy&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy (AFM&#8208;SMFS) to directly measure the rupture force of Co(II)&#8208;thiolate bond in Co&#8208;substituted rubredoxin (CoRD). By combining the chemical denature/renature method for building metalloprotein and cysteine coupling&#8208;based polyprotein construction strategy, we successfully prepared the polyprotein sample (CoRD)  n  suitable for single&#8208;molecule study. Thus, we quantified the strength of Co(II)&#8208;thiolate bonds in &#160;rubredoxin with a rupture force of ~140 pN, revealing that the bond is a stable chemical bond. In addition, the Co&#8208;S bond is more labile than the Zn&#8208;S bond in proteins, similar to the result from the metal&#8208;competing titration experiment.</dc:description>

         <title>High Throughput Screening of Signal Peptide Library with Novel Fluorescent Probe</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrile hydratase (NHase) is an excellent bio&#8208;catalyst for the synthesis of amide compounds, was composed of two heterologous subunits. However, the secretory expression of NHase has been difficult to achieve because of its complex expression mechanism. In this work, a novel fluorescent probe Rho&#8208;IDA&#8208;CoII was synthesized by the one&#8208;pot method. Rho&#8208;IDA&#8208;CoII could specifically label His&#8208;tagged proteins in vitro specifically, such as staining in&#8208;gel, western blot and ELISA. Furthermore, Rho&#8208;IDA&#8208;CoII combined with dot blot could quantitatively detect His&#8208;tagged proteins between 1 &#8211; 10 pmol and perform high&#8208;throughput screening for the NHase signal peptide library. The recombinant Bacillus subtilis WB800/phoB&#8208;HBA with the extracellular expression of NHase was screened from ca. 6500 clones. After optimization of fermentation conditions, the NHase activity in the culture supernatant reached to 17.34 &#177; 0.16 U/mL. It was the first time to express secretory NHase in Bacillus subtilis successfully.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetraphenylethene Derivatives Modulate the RNA Hairpin&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex Conformational Equilibria in Proto&#8208;Oncogenes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (GQs) sequence in 5' UTRs of certain proto&#8208;oncogenes colocalize with hairpin (Hp) forming sequence resulting in intramolecular Hp&#8208;GQ conformational equilibria which is suggested to regulate cancer development and progression. Thus, regulation of Hp&#8208;GQ equilibria with small molecules is an attractive but less explored therapeutic approach. Herein, two tetraphenylethenes (TPE) derivatives TPE&#8208;Py and TPE&#8208;MePy were synthesized and their effect on Hp&#8208;GQ equilibrium was explored. The FRET, CD and molecular docking experiments suggested that cationic TPE&#8208;MePy shifts the Hp&#8208;GQ equilibrium significantly towards the GQ conformer mainly through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and van der waals interaction. In presence of TPE&#8208;MePy the observed rate constant values for first and second folding step was increased up to 14.6 and 2.6&#8208;fold respectively. The FRET melting assay showed a strong stabilizing ability of TPE&#8208;MePy (&#916;Tm = 4.36 &#176;C). Notably, the unmethylated derivative TPE&#8208;Py did not alter the Hp&#8208;GQ equilibrium. Subsequently, the luciferase assay demonstrated that the TPE&#8208;MePy derivatives suppressed the translation efficiency by &#8764;5.7&#8208;fold by shifting the Hp&#8208;GQ equilibrium toward GQ conformers in 5&#8217; UTR of TRF2. Our data suggest that HpGQ equilibria could be selectively targeted with small molecules to modulate translation for therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Antibody&#8208;Recruitment as a Therapeutic Strategy: A Brief History and Recent Advances</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antibodies are a significant and growing sector within the global pharmaceutical industry. The popularity of antibodies as therapeutics derives from, at least in part, evolvable affinity for virtually any disease&#8208;relevant cell surface receptor, as well as unique immunotherapeutic mechanisms of action, including neutralization, Antibody&#8208;Dependent Cellular Phagocytosis (ADCP), Complement&#8208;Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC), and Antibody&#8208;Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC). While advances in the large&#8208;scale expression and purification of therapeutic antibodies have been made, this remains costly and laborious tasks. Agents that redirect endogenous antibodies to target a pathogen or malignant cell obviate the need for new antibody discovery and production. Chimeric antibody&#8208;recruiting technologies consist of a target cell surface receptor binding domain, and an endogenous antibody&#8208;binding domain. By design, these agents bring endogenous antibodies to the surface of a target pathogen or diseased cell, which can result in targeted cytotoxicity by antibody&#8208;dependent mechanisms. This review highlights seminal contributions and recent advances in this growing and important therapeutic field.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthetic Gene Cluster of linaridin Peptides Contain Epimerase Gene</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Salinipeptins belong to the type&#8208;A linaridin class of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) comprising 22 amino acid residues with multiple D&#8208;amino acids. Although chirality of other type&#8208;A linaridins, such as grisemycin and cypemycin, has not been reported, the biosynthetic gene clusters of type&#8208;A linaridins have identical gene organization. Here, we report heterologous expression of grisemycin biosynthetic gene cluster (  grm  ) and show that grisemycin contained multiple D&#8208;amino acids, similar to salinipeptins. The heterologous expression experiments also confirmed involvement of a novel peptide epimerase in grisemycin biosynthesis. Gene&#8208;deletion experiments indicated that  grmL  , a sole gene with unknown function, was indispensable for grisemycin production. We also show that the presence of D&#8208;amino acids is likely a common feature of linaridin natural products by analyzing two other type&#8208;A linaridin clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Membrane Anchorage&#8208;Induced (MAGIC) Knockdown of Non&#8208;synonymous Point Mutations**
</title>

         <dc:description>
A new approach for inhibiting the expression of non&#8208;synonymous single nucleotide genetic variant (nsSNV) is depicted in this image. Membrane anchorage&#8208;induced (MAGIC) knockdown of nsSNV occurs when specific polysomal polypeptides are recruited to inner cell membranes via membrane tethered phospholipid&#8208;conjugated point mutation&#8208;specific monoclonal antibody or single chain variable fragment.







Abstract
The promise of personalized medicine for monogenic and complex polygenic diseases depends on the availability of strategies for targeted inhibition of disease&#8208;associated polymorphic protein variants. Loss of function variants, including non&#8208;synonymous single nucleotide variants (nsSNVs) and insertion/deletion producing a frameshift, account for the vast majority of disease&#8208;related genetic changes. Because it is challenging to interpret the functional consequences of nsSNVs, they are considered a big barrier for personalized medicine. A method for inhibiting the specific expression of nsSNVs without editing the human genome will facilitate the elucidation of the biology of nsSNVs, but such a method is currently lacking. Here, I describe the phenomenon of membrane anchorage&#8208;induced (MAGIC) knockdown of allele&#8208;specific inhibition of protein and mRNA expression upon inner membrane tethering of point mutation&#8208;specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb). This phenomenon is likely mediated by a mechanism distinct from the protein degradation pathways, as the epitope&#8208;specific knockdown is replicated upon intracellular expression of a membrane&#8208;anchored single domain intrabody that lacks the Fc domain of the mAb. By harnessing the MAGIC knockdown of epitope&#8208;containing protein targets, I report a novel approach for inhibiting the expression of amino&#8208;acid&#8208;altering germline and somatic nsSNVs. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, I show the inhibition of human disease&#8208;associated variants namely, FGFR4 p.G388R, KRAS p.G12D and BRAF p.V600E protein variants. This method opens up a new avenue for not just therapeutic suppression of undruggable protein variants, but also for functional interrogation of the nsSNVs of unknown significance.

         <title>Whole&#8208;Cell Biotransformation of Penicillin G by a Three&#8208;Enzyme Co&#8208;expression System with Engineered Deacetoxycephalosporin&#8197;C Synthase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase (DAOCS) requires 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) as a co&#8208;substrate to catalyze the conversion of penicillin G to phenylacetyl&#8208;7&#8208;aminodeacetoxycephalosporin acid (G&#8208;7&#8208;ADCA). Catalase and L&#8208;GOX were introduced into the catalytic process of ring expansion to construct a 2OG production module to form a three&#8208;enzyme co&#8208;expression system, so as to realize the conversion of penicillin G to G&#8208;7&#8208;ADCA in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase (DAOCS) catalyzes the transformation of penicillin G to phenylacetyl&#8208;7&#8208;aminodeacetoxycephalosporanic acid (G&#8208;7&#8208;ADCA) for which it depends on 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) as co&#8208;substrate. However, the low activity of DAOCS and the expense of 2OG restricts its practical applications in the production of G&#8208;7&#8208;ADCA. Herein, a rational design campaign was performed on a DAOCS from Streptomyces clavuligerus (scDAOCS) in the quest to construct novel expandases. The resulting mutants showed 25&#8764;58&#8201;% increase in activity compared to the template. The dominant DAOCS variants were then embedded into a three&#8208;enzyme co&#8208;expression system, consisting of a catalase and an L&#8208;glutamic oxidase for the generation of 2OG, to convert penicillin G to G&#8208;7&#8208;ADCA in E.&#8197;coli. The engineered whole&#8208;cell enzyme cascade was applied to an up&#8208;scaled reaction, exhibiting a yield of G&#8208;7&#8208;ADCA up to 39.21&#8197;mM (14.6&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1) with a conversion of 78.42&#8197;mol&#8201;%. This work highlights the potential of the integrated whole&#8208;cell system that may inspire further research on green and efficient production of 7&#8208;ADCA.

         <title>Carbonate&#8208;Based Fluorescent Chemical Tool for Uncovering Carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) Activity Variations in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) is responsible for the metabolism of many drugs, however, factors that modulate CES1 activity are poorly studied. In this research article, the self&#8208;immolative properties of carbonates are exploited to generate a fluorescent chemical tool, FCP&#8208;1, from a commercially available fluorophore. The ability of FCP&#8208;1 to report on endogenous CES1 in live cells is demonstrated before this fluorescent chemical tool is deployed to develop an assay that can measure the activity differences between CES1 isoforms in live cells. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.&#8197;W. Beck et&#8197;al.

         <title>Broadening the Scope of the Flavin&#8208;Tag Method by Improving Flavin Incorporation and Incorporating Flavin Analogs</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flavin&#8208;tag 2.0: The Flavin&#8208;tag method can be used for labelling of proteins with various chromo&#8208; and fluorophores and redox&#8208;active probes, including flavin (yellow), roseoflavin (red), 5&#8208;deazaflavin (fluorescent), and nicotinamide.







Abstract
Methods for facile site&#8208;selective modifications of proteins are in high demand. We have recently shown that a flavin transferase can be used for site&#8208;specific covalent attachment of a chromo&#8208; and fluorogenic flavin (FMN) to any targeted protein. Although this Flavin&#8208;tag method resulted in efficient labeling of proteins in&#8197;vitro, labelling in E. coli cells resulted in partial flavin incorporation. It was also restricted in the type of installed label with only one type of flavin, FMN, being incorporated. Here, we report on an extension of the Flavin&#8208;tag method that addresses previous limitations. We demonstrate that co&#8208;expression of FAD synthetase improves the flavin incorporation efficiency, allowing complete flavin&#8208;labeling of a target protein in E. coli cells. Furthermore, we have found that various flavin derivatives and even a nicotinamide can be covalently attached to a target protein, rendering this method even more versatile and valuable.

         <title>Omicron: Understanding the Latest Variant of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8201;and Strategies for Tackling the Infection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Omicron variant can be calssified as BA.1, BA.2, and BA.3. Due to mutations in genes encoding its S protein and other parts of the virus, concerns have been raised regarding the effectiveness of existing vaccines and diagnostic tools to fight against Omicron infection.







Abstract
The new variant of concern of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, namely Omicron, has triggered global fear recently. To date, our knowledge of Omicron, particularly of how S glycoprotein mutations affect the infectivity of the virus and the severity of the infection, is far from complete. This hinders our ability to treat the disease and to predict the future state of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 threats to well&#8208;being and economic stability. Despite this, efforts have been made to unveil the routes of transmission and the efficiency of existing vaccines in tackling Omicron. This article reviews the latest understanding of Omicron and the current status of the use of vaccines and drugs for infection control. It is hoped that this article can offer insights into the development of more effective measures to tackle the pandemic.

         <title>Synthetic Supramolecular Host for D&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;Ribose: Ratiometric Fluorescence Response via Multivalent Lectin&#8208;Carbohydrate Interactions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Easily synthesizable, carbazole&#8208;based organic nanoaggregates have been designed for selective detection of D&#8208; (&#8208;)&#8208;ribose at physiological pH. The addition of D&#8208;ribose results in a ratiometric change in fluorescence color from green to cyan (LOD: ~12 &#181;M). The mechanistic studies indicate the presence of multipoint noncovalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding and CH&#8208;&#960; between D&#8208;ribose and acyl hydrazone and terminal pyridyl units of the probe molecule. However, such kind multipoint interactions dissociate the preformed self&#8208;assembled nanoclusters and induce change in optical response. The probe molecule is further exploited in analyzing D&#8208;ribose content in biological fluids (diluted human urine and blood serum) and oral supplements. The small standard deviation values (2&#8208;3.8%) with nearly quantitative recovery (93.5 &#8211; 105.5%) indicate the high accuracy of the present method. Further, low&#8208;cost portable device based coated paper strips are designed for &#8216;on&#8208;location&#8217; rapid, detection of D&#8208;ribose even at remote locations.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetraphenylporphyrin Enters the Ring: First Example of a Complex between Highly Bulky Porphyrins and a Protein**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Joining the race: The native haemoprotein HasA can be coaxed into capturing extremely bulky and water&#8208;insoluble metallotetraphenylporphyrins (metalloTPPs). The reproducible, rapid crystallisation of metalloTPP&#8208;HasA was possible at excellent resolutions, revealing in rich detail of how different metalloTPPs are accommodated by HasA. Furthermore, the combination of TPP chemistry with HasA enables the inactivation of multiple strains of multidrug&#8208;resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as the cyclopropanation of styrene.







Abstract
Tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) is a symmetrically substituted synthetic porphyrin whose properties can be readily modified, providing it with significant advantages over naturally occurring porphyrins. Herein, we report the first example of a stable complex between a native biomolecule, the haemoprotein HasA, and TPP as well as its derivatives. The X&#8208;ray crystal structures of nine different HasA&#8208;TPP complexes were solved at high resolutions. HasA capturing TPP derivatives was also demonstrated to inhibit growth of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Mutant variants of HasA binding FeTPP were shown to possess a different mode of coordination, permitting the cyclopropanation of styrene.

         <title>Synthesis of Nicotinamide Mononucleotide from Xylose via Coupling Engineered Escherichia coli and a Biocatalytic Cascade</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) synthesis was developed by coupling two modules. In module 1, the recombinant E. coli metabolizes xylose to generate D&#8208;ribose, which can be diluted to 1&#8197;mM for NMN synthesis with 84&#8201;% yield in module 2.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) has recently gained attention for a nutritional supplement because it is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). In this study, we developed NMN synthesis by coupling two modules. The first module is to culture E. coli MG1655 &#9653;tktA &#9653;tktB &#9653;ptsG to metabolize xylose to generate D&#8208;ribose in the medium. The supernatant containing D&#8208;ribose was applied in the second module which is composed of EcRbsK&#8208;EcPRPS&#8208;CpNAMPT reaction to synthesize NMN, that requires additional enzymes of CHU0107 and EcPPase to remove feedback inhibitors ADP and pyrophosphate. The second module can be rapidly optimized by comparing NMN production determined by the cyanide assay. Finally, 10&#8197;mL optimal biocascade reaction generated NMN with a good yield of 84&#8201;% from 1&#8197;mM D&#8208;ribose supplied from the supernatant of E. coli MG1655 &#9653;tktA &#9653;tktB &#9653;ptsG. Our results can further guide researchers to metabolically engineer E. coli for NMN synthesis.

         <title>Different Oligomeric States of the Tumor Suppressor p53 Show Identical Binding Behavior towards the S100&#946; Homodimer</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining ESI&#8208;MS, SPR, and XL&#8208;MS, we investigated the interactions between the tumor suppressor p53 and S100&#946;. Our approach unveiled binding of an S100&#946; dimer to p53, independently from p53&#8217;s oligomeric state via similar molecular contacts and with comparable binding affinities. The molecular mechanism by which S100&#946; regulates p53 activity goes beyond the currently proposed oligomerization inhibition mechanism.







Abstract
The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcription factor that is referred to as the &#8220;guardian of the genome&#8221; and plays an important role in cancer development. p53 is active as a homotetramer; the S100&#946; homodimer binds to the intrinsically disordered C&#8208;terminus of p53 affecting its transcriptional activity. The p53/S100&#946; complex is regarded as highly promising therapeutic target in cancer. It has been suggested that S100&#946; exerts its oncogenic effects by altering the p53 oligomeric state. Our aim was to study the structures and oligomerization behavior of different p53/S100&#946; complexes by ESI&#8208;MS, XL&#8208;MS, and SPR. Wild&#8208;type p53 and single amino acid variants, representing different oligomeric states of p53 were individually investigated regarding their binding behavior towards S100&#946;. The stoichiometry of the different p53/S100&#946; complexes were determined by ESI&#8208;MS showing that tetrameric, dimeric, and monomeric p53 variants all bind to an S100&#946; dimer. In addition, XL&#8208;MS revealed the topologies of the p53/S100&#946; complexes to be independent of p53&#8217;s oligomeric state. With SPR, the thermodynamic parameters were determined for S100&#946; binding to tetrameric, dimeric, or monomeric p53 variants. Our data prove that the S100&#946; homodimer binds to different oligomeric states of p53 with similar binding affinities. This emphasizes the need for alternative explanations to describe the molecular mechanisms underlying p53/S100&#946; interaction.

         <title>In Vivo Assembly and Expression of DNA Containing Non&#8208;canonical Bases in the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetic information encoded in entirely morphed genes, DZA, could be introduced in a eukaryote, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, through homologous recombination, and it proceeded via the replication machinery into functional fluorescent protein. The successful in&#8197;vivo assembly of DZA genes composed of various combinations of non&#8208;canonical nucleotides was established, which paves the way towards chemically modified eukaryotic organisms with content that differs from natural organisms.







Abstract
Chemically modified nucleic acids are of utmost interest in synthetic biology for creating a regulable and sophisticated synthetic system with tailor&#8208;made properties. Implanting chemically modified nucleic acids in microorganisms might serve biotechnological applications, while using them in human cells might lead to new advanced medicines. Previously, we reported that a fully modified DNA sequence (called DZA) composed of the four base&#8208;modified nucleotides &#8211; 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;adenine, 5&#8208;chlorouracil, 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;guanine and 5&#8208;fluorocytosine &#8211; could function as a genetic template in prokaryotic cells, Escherichia coli. Here, we report the synthesis of long, partially, or fully modified DZA fragments that encode the yeast&#8208;enhanced red fluorescent protein (yEmRFP). The DZA sequences were directly introduced in the genome of the eukaryotic cells, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, via the yeast natural homologous recombination machinery.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genetic information&lt;/b&gt; encoded in entirely morphed genes, DZA, could be introduced in a eukaryote, &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, through homologous recombination, and it proceeded via the replication machinery into functional fluorescent protein. The successful &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt; assembly of DZA genes composed of various combinations of non-canonical nucleotides was established, which paves the way towards chemically modified eukaryotic organisms with content that differs from natural organisms.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemically modified nucleic acids are of utmost interest in synthetic biology for creating a regulable and sophisticated synthetic system with tailor-made properties. Implanting chemically modified nucleic acids in microorganisms might serve biotechnological applications, while using them in human cells might lead to new advanced medicines. Previously, we reported that a fully modified DNA sequence (called DZA) composed of the four base-modified nucleotides &#8211; 7-deaza-adenine, 5-chlorouracil, 7-deaza-guanine and 5-fluorocytosine &#8211; could function as a genetic template in prokaryotic cells, &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we report the synthesis of long, partially, or fully modified DZA fragments that encode the yeast-enhanced red fluorescent protein (yEmRFP). The DZA sequences were directly introduced in the genome of the eukaryotic cells, &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, via the yeast natural homologous recombination machinery. The simple and straightforward DZA cloning strategy reported here might be of interest to scientists working in the field of xenobiology in yeast.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Claisen Condensation Reaction Mediated Pimelate Biosynthesis via the Reverse Adipate&#8208;Degradation Pathway and Its Isoenzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pimelic acid is an important dicarboxylic acid, which is broadly applied in various fields. In this study, we successfully constructed the biosynthesis pathway of pimelic acid in E. coli via Claisen condensation reaction, including the reverse adipate&#8208;degradation pathway (RADP) and BIOZ pathway. Through combining the isoenzymes in the biosynthesis pathway, the titer of pimelic acid reached 36.7&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1, laying the foundation for further production of pimelic acid and its derivatives.







Abstract
Pimelic acid is an important seven&#8208;carbon dicarboxylic acid, which is broadly applied in various fields. The industrial production of pimelic acid is mainly through a chemical method, which is complicated and environmentally unfriendly. Herein, we found that pimelic acid could be biosynthesized by the reverse adipate&#8208;degradation pathway (RADP), a typical Claisen condensation reaction that could be applied to the arrangement of C&#8722;C bond. In order to strengthen the supply of glutaryl&#8208;CoA precursor, PA5530 protein was used to transport glutaric acid. Subsequently, we discovered that the enzymes in the BIOZ pathway are isoenzyme of the RADP pathway enzymes. By combining the isoenzymes of the two pathways, the titer of pimelic acid reached 36.7&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1 under the optimal combination, which was increased by 382.9&#8201;% compared with the control strain B&#8208;3. It was also the highest titer of pimelic acid biosynthesized by Claisen condensation reaction, laying the foundation for the production of pimelic acid and its derivatives.

         <title>Proteomic Tools for the Quantitative Analysis of Artificial Peptide Libraries: Detection and Characterization of Target&#8208;Amplified PD&#8208;1 Inhibitors</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protein&#8208;directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) method, coupled to a proteomics data analysis workflow, was used to discover interface blockers of the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 interaction. The S&#8208;linked dimeric species that were significantly amplified in the protein&#8208;templated mixture were identified, synthesized, and subjected to biophysical screening.







Abstract
We report a quantitative proteomics data analysis pipeline, which coupled to protein&#8208;directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DDC) experiments, enables the rapid discovery and direct characterization of protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) modulators. A low&#8208;affinity PD&#8208;1 binder was incubated with a library of &gt;100 D&#8208;peptides under thiol&#8208;exchange favoring conditions, in the presence of the target protein PD&#8208;1, and we determined the S&#8208;linked dimeric species that resulted, amplified in the protein samples versus the controls. We chemically synthesized the target dimer candidates and validated them by thermophoresis binding and protein&#8208;protein interaction assays. The results provide a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for using this strategy in the high&#8208;throughput search of improved drug&#8208;like peptide binders that block therapeutically relevant protein&#8208;protein interactions.

         <title>Discovery of Novel Tyrosine Ammonia Lyases for the Enzymatic Synthesis of p&#8208;Coumaric Acid</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a phylogenetic tree&#8208;building approach, five novel tyrosine ammonia lyases (TALs) and three novel phenylalanine/tyrosine ammonia lyases (PTALs) were identified. The enzymes were biochemically characterized and the optimal conditions for a whole cell E. coli biotransformation were determined. Under these conditions p&#8208;coumaric acid (p&#8208;CA) yields of 2.03&#8197;g/L after 8&#8197;hours by TALclu and 2.35&#8197;g/L after 24&#8197;hours by TALrpc could be achieved.







Abstract
p&#8208;Coumaric acid (p&#8208;CA) is a key precursor for the biosynthesis of flavonoids. Tyrosine ammonia lyases (TALs) specifically catalyze the synthesis of p&#8208;CA from l&#8208;tyrosine, which is a convenient enzymatic pathway. To explore novel and highly active TALs, a phylogenetic tree&#8208;building approach was conducted including 875 putative TALs and 46 putative phenylalanine/tyrosine ammonia lyases (PTALs). Among them, 5 TALs and 3 PTALs were successfully characterized and found to exhibit the proposed enzymatic activity. The TAL from Chryseobacterium luteum sp. nov (TALclu) has the highest affinity (Km=0.019&#8197;mm) and conversion efficiency (kcat/Km=1631 s&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mm&#8722;1) towards l&#8208;tyrosine. The reaction conditions for two purified enzymes and their E. coli recombinant cells were optimized and p&#8208;CA yields of 2.03&#8197;g/L after 8&#8197;hours by TALclu and 2.35&#8197;g/L after 24&#8197;h by TAL from Rivularia sp. PCC 7116 (TALrpc) in whole cells were achieved. These TALs are thus candidates for the construction of whole&#8208;cell systems to produce the flavonoid precursor p&#8208;CA.

         <title>3,4,5&#8208;Trihydroxypiperidine Based Multivalent Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) Enhancers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multivalent piperidine iminosugars described in this work are strong inhibitors of glucocerebrosidase (GCase), the defective enzyme in Gaucher disease. The trivalent derivative 12 was able to double GCase activity in patient's fibroblasts homozygous for the L444P mutation, which is resistant to most pharmacological chaperones. Co&#8208;incubation of 12 with recombinant GCase enzyme paves the way to its application in PC/ERT therapy.







Abstract
The synthesis of five new multivalent derivatives of a trihydroxypiperidine iminosugar was accomplished through copper catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction of an azido ending piperidine and several propargylated scaffolds. The resulting multivalent architectures were assayed as inhibitors of lysosomal GCase, the defective enzyme in Gaucher disease. The multivalent compounds resulted in much more potent inhibitors than a parent monovalent reference compound, thus showing a good multivalent effect. Biological investigation of these compounds as pharmacological chaperones revealed that the trivalent derivative (12) gives a 2&#8208;fold recovery of the GCase activity on Gaucher patient fibroblasts bearing the L444P/L444P mutations responsible for neuropathies. Additionally, a thermal denaturation experiment showed its ability to impart stability to the recombinant enzyme used in therapy.

         <title>Structure and Mutation of the Native Amine Dehydrogenase MATOUAmDH2</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The native amine dehydrogenase MATOUAmDH2, catalyzes the ammoniation of small aliphatic ketones with high selectivity. Structural analysis reveals domain movements associated with the formation of the active site. This informed the design of mutants that have superior activity for the amination of cyclohexanone with either ammonia or methylamine.







Abstract
Native amine dehydrogenases (nat&#8208;AmDHs) have recently emerged as a potentially valuable new reservoir of enzymes for the sustainable and selective synthesis of chiral amines, catalyzing the NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent ammoniation of carbonyl compounds with high activity and selectivity. MATOUAmDH2, recently identified from the Marine Atlas of Tara Oceans Unigenes (MATOUv1) database of eukaryotic genes, displays exceptional catalytic performance against its best identified substrate, isobutyraldehyde, as well as having broader substrate scope than other nat&#8208;AmDHs. In the interests of providing a platform for the rational engineering of this and other nat&#8208;AmDHs, we have determined the structure of MATOUAmDH2 in complex with NADP+ and also with the cofactor and cyclohexylamine. Monomers within the structure are representative of more open and closed conformations of the enzyme and illustrate the profound changes undergone by nat&#8208;AmDHs during the catalytic cycle. An alanine screen of active site residues revealed that M215A and L180A are more active than the wild&#8208;type enzyme for the amination of cyclohexanone with ammonia and methylamine respectively; the latter suggests that AmDHs have the potential to be engineered for the improved production of secondary amines.

         <title>Photocontrollable Probes for Mitochondrial Protein Profiling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two photocontrollable probes (YGH&#8208;1 and YGH&#8208;2) were synthesized and used for mitochondrial proteomic studies. Our results show that the probes can be successfully used for spatial and temporal analysis of subcellular proteomes.







Abstract
The mitochondrion is the core site of cell signaling, energy metabolism and biosynthesis. Here, taking advantage of activity&#8208;based probes, we synthesized two photocontrollable probes (YGH&#8208;1 and YGH&#8208;2), composed of a mitochondrial localization moiety &#8220;triphenylphosphonium&#8221;, a photo&#8208;triggered group to achieve spatially and temporally controlled protein capture, and an alkyne group to enrich the labeled protein. Proteomic validation was further carried out to facilitate identification of the mitochondrial proteome in HeLa cells. The results show that half of the identified protein hits (&#8764;300) labeled by YGH&#8208;1 and YGH&#8208;2 belong to mitochondria, and are mostly localized in the mitochondrial matrix and inner mitochondrial membrane. Our results provide a new tool for spatial and temporal analysis of subcellular proteomes.

         <title>C&#8208;Nitrosothioformamide: A Donor Template for Dual Release of HNO and H2S</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction triggered dual release of H2S and HNO from C&#8208;nitrosothioformamides is reported. This process produces HNO and COS concurrently. COS can be further converted to H2S by carbonic anhydrase. These donors may be useful to understanding the crosstalk between H2S and HNO.







Abstract
C&#8208;Nitrosothioformamide was demonstrated to be a donor template for dual release of HNO and COS triggered by a retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. COS is an H2S precursor in the presence of carbonic anhydrase. This process produces HNO and H2S in a slow but steady manner. As such, the direct reaction between HNO and H2S under this situation appears to be minor. This may provide a useful tool for studying the synergistic effects of HNO and H2S.

         <title>Artificial Fusions between P450 BM3 and an Alcohol Dehydrogenase for Efficient (+)&#8208;Nootkatone Production</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fruitful fusion: A cytochrome P450 BM3 mutant and an alcohol dehydrogenase were genetically fused in different order and with different linkers to unite both substrate oxidation and cofactor regeneration in one construct. The fusions exhibited higher activity compared to separate enzymes as highlighted with the two&#8208;step oxidation of (+)&#8208;valencene to the grapefruit aroma (+)&#8208;nootkatone formed at a concentration of 1080&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;enzyme cascades enable the production of valuable chemical compounds, and fusion of the enzymes that catalyze these reactions can improve the reaction outcome. In this work, P450 BM3 from Bacillus megaterium and an alcohol dehydrogenase from Sphingomonas yanoikuyae were fused to bifunctional constructs to enable cofactor regeneration and improve the in&#8197;vitro two&#8208;step oxidation of (+)&#8208;valencene to (+)&#8208;nootkatone. An up to 1.5&#8208;fold increased activity of P450 BM3 was achieved with the fusion constructs compared to the individual enzyme. Conversion of (+)&#8208;valencene coupled to cofactor regeneration and performed in the presence of the solubilizing agent cyclodextrin resulted in up to 1080&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 (+)&#8208;nootkatone produced by the fusion constructs as opposed to 620&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 produced by a mixture of the separate enzymes. Thus, a two&#8208;step (+)&#8208;valencene oxidation was considerably improved through the simple method of enzyme fusion.

         <title>Switchable DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Library: Interconversion between Double&#8208; and Single&#8208;Stranded DNA Formats</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Existing DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library (DEL) encoding methods were classified into single&#8208;stranded DNA&#8208;based strategies and double&#8208;stranded DNA&#8208;based strategies. To deal with the conflict between the two DNA formats, the concept of interconversion between double&#8208; and single&#8208;stranded DNA&#8208;encoded chemical libraries is proposed and practically realized.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded chemical libraries (DEL) have attracted substantial attention due to the infinite possibility for hit discovery in both pharmaceutical companies and academia. The encoding method is the initial step of DEL construction and one of the cornerstones of DEL applications. Classified by the DNA format, the existing DEL encoding strategies were categorized into single&#8208;stranded DNA&#8208;based strategies and double&#8208;stranded DNA&#8208;based strategies. The two DEL formats have their unique advantages but are usually incompatible with each other. To address this issue, we propose the concept of interconversion between double&#8208; and single&#8208;stranded DEL based on the &#8220;reversible covalent headpiece (RCHP)&#8221; design, which combines maximum robustness of synthesis with extraordinary flexibility of applications in distinct setups. Future opportunities in this field are also proposed to advance DEL technology to a comprehensive drug discovery platform.

The iron&#8208;sulfur cluster is one of the most versatile cofactors in nature. This cover feature highlights the study of an iron&#8208;sulfur cluster dependent enzyme, catalysing the dehydration reaction of dihydroxy acids to &#945;&#8208;ketoacids. This is one of the key steps in the valorisation of biomass and industrial by&#8208;products to chemicals, feed, and biofuels. Combining in silico prediction with in&#8197;vitro validation, structure&#8208;function relationships were deduced, and a more active variant toward a non&#8208;natural reaction was designed. More information can be found in the Research Article by V. Sieber et&#8197;al.

         <title>Isolation of Tobacco Mosaic Virus&#8208;Binding Peptides for Biotechnology Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biopanning led to the identification of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)&#8208;binding peptides that can be utilized for diagnostic assays to detect TMV in plant sap or for biotechnology applications such as adding functional moieties to the TMV used as nanocarrier.







Abstract
Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) was the first virus to be discovered and it is now widely used as a tool for biological research and biotechnology applications. TMV particles can be decorated with functional molecules by genetic engineering or bioconjugation. However, this can destabilize the nanoparticles, and/or multiple rounds of modification may be necessary, reducing product yields and preventing the display of certain cargo molecules. To overcome these challenges, we used phage display technology and biopanning to isolate a TMV&#8208;binding peptide (TBPT25) with strong binding properties (IC50=0.73&#8197;&#956;M, KD=0.16&#8197;&#956;M), allowing the display of model cargos via a single mixing step. The TMV&#8208;binding peptide is specific for TMV but does not recognize free coat proteins and can therefore be used to decorate intact TMV or detect intact TMV particles in crude plant sap.

         <title>Structural Dynamics Support Electrostatic Interactions in the Active Site of Adenylate Kinase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AKE protein residues exerting the highest electric fields along the reactive bond are also the residues that visit the most conformations within the picosecond to microsecond timescale. This effect is further exacerbated by entropy&#8208;tuning mutations that otherwise leave the average protein structure unchanged.







Abstract
Electrostatic preorganization as well as structural and dynamic heterogeneity are often used to rationalize the remarkable catalytic efficiency of enzymes. However, they are often presented as incompatible because the generation of permanent electrostatic effects implies that the protein structure remains rigid. Here, we use a metric, electric fields, that can treat electrostatic contributions and dynamics effects on equal footing, for a unique perspective on enzymatic catalysis. We find that the residues that contribute the most to electrostatic interactions with the substrate in the active site of Adenylate Kinase (our working example) are also the most flexible residues. Further, entropy&#8208;tuning mutations raise flexibility at the picosecond timescale where more conformations can be visited on short time periods, thereby softening the sharp heterogeneity normally visible at the microsecond timescale.

         <title>Trichoderma&#8208;Derived Pentapeptides from the Infected Nest Mycobiome of the Subterranean Termite Coptotermes testaceus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metabolic opportunities from an infected termite nest: Isolation and structural analysis by NMR spectroscopy and MS/MS revealed a novel pentapeptide (FE011) and five derivatives produced by a strain of Trichoderma enriched in and isolated from an infected nest of the wood&#8208;feeding termite Coptotermes testaceus.







Abstract
Termites live in a dynamic environment where colony health is strongly influenced by surrounding microbes. However, little is known about the mycobiomes of lower termites and their nests, and how these change in response to disease. Here we compared the individual and nest mycobiomes of a healthy subterranean termite colony (Coptotermes testaceus) to one infected and ultimately eradicated by a fungal pathogen. We identified Trichoderma species in the materials of both nests, but they were also abundant in the infected termites. Methanolic extracts of Trichoderma sp. FHG000531, isolated from the infected nest, were screened for secondary metabolites by UHPLC&#8208;HR MS/MS&#8208;guided molecular networking. We identified many bioactive compounds with potential roles in the eradication of the infected colony, as well as a cluster of six unknown peptides. The novel peptide FE011 was isolated and characterized by NMR spectroscopy. The function of this novel peptide family as well as the role of Trichoderma species in dying termite colonies therefore requires further investigation.

         <title>Probing Site&#8208;Selective Conjugation Chemistries for the Construction of Homogeneous Synthetic Glycodendriproteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homogeneous glycodendriproteins: A comparative reactive platform was designed via use of C&#8722;S bond&#8208;forming reactions (unprecedented for this family of glycoconjugates) and via triazoles (in two orientations), from recombinant proteins containing non&#8208;canonical amino acids (dehydroalanine, homoallylglycine, homopropargylglycine, and azidohomoalanine) that can give access to well&#8208;defined glycodendriproteins as synthetic functional mimics of N&#8208;linked glycoproteins.







Abstract
Methods that site&#8208;selectively attach multivalent carbohydrate moieties to proteins can be used to generate homogeneous glycodendriproteins as synthetic functional mimics of glycoproteins. Here, we study aspects of the scope and limitations of some common bioconjugation techniques that can give access to well&#8208;defined glycodendriproteins. A diverse reactive platform was designed via use of thiol&#8208;Michael&#8208;type additions, thiol&#8208;ene reactions, and Cu(I)&#8208;mediated azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions from recombinant proteins containing the non&#8208;canonical amino acids dehydroalanine, homoallylglycine, homopropargylglycine, and azidohomoalanine.

Catalytically active non&#8208;metal cofactors in enzymes carry out a variety of different reactions. The efforts to develop derivatives of naturally occurring cofactors such as flavins or pyridoxal phosphate and the advances to design new, non&#8208;natural cofactors are reviewed here. We report the status quo for enzymes harboring organocatalysts as derivatives of natural cofactors or as artificial ones and their application in the asymmetric synthesis of various compounds.

         <title>Structural Properties Dictating Selective Optotracer Detection of Staphylococcus aureus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optotracers are conformation&#8208;sensitive fluorescent tracer molecules that detect peptide&#8208; and carbohydrate&#8208;based biopolymers. In this study, we investigated the structural properties providing optimal detection of Staphylococcus aureus. We show that the chemical structure and photophysics of these molecules are key tunable characteristics in the development of optotracers for selective detection of bacterial species.







Abstract
Optotracers are conformation&#8208;sensitive fluorescent tracer molecules that detect peptide&#8208; and carbohydrate&#8208;based biopolymers. Their binding to bacterial cell walls allows selective detection and visualisation of Staphylococcus aureus (S.&#8197;aureus). Here, we investigated the structural properties providing optimal detection of S.&#8197;aureus. We quantified spectral shifts and fluorescence intensity in mixes of bacteria and optotracers, using automatic peak analysis, cross&#8208;correlation, and area&#8208;under&#8208;curve analysis. We found that the length of the conjugated backbone and the number of charged groups, but not their distribution, are important factors for selective detection of S.&#8197;aureus. The photophysical properties of optotracers were greatly improved by incorporating a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D)&#8208;type motif in the conjugated backbone. With significantly reduced background and binding&#8208;induced on&#8208;switch of fluorescence, these optotracers enabled real&#8208;time recordings of S.&#8197;aureus growth. Collectively, this demonstrates that chemical structure and photophysics are key tunable characteristics in the development of optotracers for selective detection of bacterial species.

         <title>Conformationally Constrained Sialyl Analogues as New Potential Binders of h&#8208;CD22</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The h&#8208;CD22 ability to regulate the immune system has made this receptor an attractive therapeutic target. Here we report the characterization of the binding epitopes and affinities of two synthetic analogues bound to h&#8208;CD22 together with the determination of tridimensional models of the protein&#8208;ligand complexes.







Abstract
Here, two conformationally constrained sialyl analogues were synthesized and characterized in their interaction with the inhibitory Siglec, human CD22 (h&#8208;CD22). An orthogonal approach, including biophysical assays (SPR and fluorescence), ligand&#8208;based NMR techniques, and molecular modelling, was employed to disentangle the interaction mechanisms at a molecular level. The results showed that the Sialyl&#8208;TnThr antigen analogue represents a promising scaffold for the design of novel h&#8208;CD22 inhibitors. Our findings also suggest that the introduction of a biphenyl moiety at position 9 of the sialic acid hampers canonical accommodation of the ligand in the protein binding pocket, even though the affinity with respect to the natural ligand is increased. Our results address the search for novel modifications of the Neu5Ac&#8208;&#945;(2&#8208;6)&#8208;Gal epitope, outline new insights for the design and synthesis of high&#8208;affinity h&#8208;CD22 ligands, and offer novel prospects for therapeutic intervention to prevent autoimmune diseases and B&#8208;cell malignancies.

         <title>Optimizing the Chemiluminescence of a Light&#8208;Producing Deoxyribozyme</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Factors that affect the catalytic activity of Supernova, a light&#8208;producing deoxyribozyme recently discovered in our group, were investigated in this study. These experiments indicate that multiple zinc ions are required for function, suggesting a mechanistic link between Supernova and proteins that catalyze related reactions. They also made it possible to increase the rate enhancement of light production by &gt;1000&#8208;fold.







Abstract
Supernova is a chemiluminescent deoxyribozyme recently discovered in our group. It transfers the phosphate group from the 1,2&#8208;dioxetane substrate CDP&#8208;Star to its 5&#8242; hydroxyl group, which triggers a decomposition reaction and the production of light. Here we investigated the effects of reaction conditions on the ability of Supernova to generate a chemiluminescent signal (using a plate reader assay) and to phosphorylate itself (using a ligation assay). Our experiments indicate that multiple zinc ions are required for catalytic function, suggesting links between Supernova and protein enzymes that catalyze similar reactions. They also show how factors such as pH, potassium concentration, CDP&#8208;Star concentration, and DNA concentration affect the reaction. By combining information from different experiments, the rate enhancement of light production was increased by more than 1000&#8208;fold. These results should be useful for applications in which Supernova is used as a sensor.

         <title>The Complex Roles of Adenosine Triphosphate in Bioenergetics</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One of the major roles of ATP is to modify protein structure through binding. Examples are motor proteins and ABC transporters. Other major roles are played by the ADP and Pi products of its hydrolysis.







Abstract
ATP is generally defined as the &#8220;energy currency&#8221; of the cell. Its phosphoanhydride P&#8722;O bonds are often considered to be &#8220;high energy&#8221; linkages that release free energy when broken, and its hydrolysis is described as &#8220;strongly exergonic&#8221;. However, breaking bonds cannot release energy and ATP hydrolysis in motor and active transport proteins is not &#8220;strongly exergonic&#8221;. So, the relevance of ATP resides elsewhere. As important as the nucleotide are the proteins that undergo functionally relevant conformational changes upon both ATP binding and release of ADP and inorganic phosphate. ATP phosphorylates proteins for signaling, active transport, and substrates in condensation reactions. The ensuing dephosphorylation has different consequences in each case. In signaling and active transport the phosphate group is hydrolyzed whereas in condensation reactions the phosphoryl fragment acts as a dehydrating agent. As it will be discussed in this article, ATP does much more than simply contribute free energy to biological processes.

         <title>Allosteric Probe Recognition Initiated Cascade Transcription Amplification for Sensitive Analysis of Exosomes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sensitive and specific exosome detection approach is established based on target recognition initiated cascade signal amplification. There are in total three procedures in the approach including: i) allosteric probe based specific recognition of target exosomes, ii) polymerase based chain extension and Nt&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BstNBI based chain liberation, and iii) generated spinach RNA sequences binding to DFHBI to produce enhanced fluorescence signal.







Abstract
Sensitive and accurate analysis of exosomes is important for many biological processes including as a biomarker for cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) diagnosis and therapy. Herein, we established a sensitive and specific exosome detection approach based on target recognition initiated cascade signal amplification. In this method, an allosteric probe was designed with a hairpin structure for specific recognition of the exosome followed by signal amplification. After the cascade signal amplification process, spinach RNA sequences bind to DFHBI ((Z)&#8208;4&#8208;(3,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;5(4H)&#8208;one) to produce enhanced fluorescence signal (approximate 2000 fold than that of inactive DFHBI). Compared with former proposed exosome detection techniques, this method exhibited a comparable detection range, but with an easy&#8208;to&#8208;design toolbox. Therefore, we believe that the proposed approach holds great potential for exosome based early diagnosis and prognosis of disease.

     alt="Allosteric Probe Recognition Initiated Cascade Transcription Amplification for Sensitive Analysis of Exosomes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A sensitive and specific&lt;/b&gt; exosome detection approach is established based on target recognition initiated cascade signal amplification. There are in total three procedures in the approach including: i) allosteric probe based specific recognition of target exosomes, ii) polymerase based chain extension and Nt&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BstNBI based chain liberation, and iii) generated spinach RNA sequences binding to DFHBI to produce enhanced fluorescence signal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensitive and accurate analysis of exosomes is important for many biological processes including as a biomarker for cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) diagnosis and therapy. Herein, we established a sensitive and specific exosome detection approach based on target recognition initiated cascade signal amplification. In this method, an allosteric probe was designed with a hairpin structure for specific recognition of the exosome followed by signal amplification. After the cascade signal amplification process, spinach RNA sequences bind to DFHBI ((&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-4-(3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene)-1,2-dimethyl-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-imidazol-5(4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-one) to produce enhanced fluorescence signal (approximate 2000 fold than that of inactive DFHBI). Compared with former proposed exosome detection techniques, this method exhibited a comparable detection range, but with an easy-to-design toolbox. Therefore, we believe that the proposed approach holds great potential for exosome based early diagnosis and prognosis of disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Modulation of the Catalytic Properties of [2Fe&#8722;2S]&#8208;Dependent Dehydratases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme catalysis: In silico and in&#8197;vitro investigations enabled the elucidation of the role of important active site residues of the enzymes dihydroxyacid dehydratase (DHAD) and sugar acid&#8208;specific dehydratase (DHT), both belonging to the FeS cluster&#8208;dependent ilvD/EDD superfamily. We proposed a new classification for these enzymes, and we were able to alter their substrate preference, improving activities for non&#8208;natural substrates significantly.







Abstract
The FeS cluster&#8208;dependent dihydroxyacid dehydratases (DHADs) and sugar acid&#8208;specific dehydratases (DHTs) from the ilvD/EDD superfamily are key enzymes in the bioproduction of a wide variety of chemicals. We analyzed [2Fe&#8722;2S]&#8208;dependent dehydratases in silico and in&#8197;vitro, deduced functionally relevant sequence, structure, and activity relationships within the ilvD/EDD superfamily, and we propose a new classification based on their evolutionary relationships and substrate profiles. In silico simulations and analyses identified several key positions for specificity, which were experimentally investigated with site&#8208;directed and saturation mutagenesis. We thus increased the promiscuity of DHAD from Fontimonas thermophila (FtDHAD), showing &gt;10&#8208;fold improved activity toward D&#8208;gluconate, and shifted the substrate preference of DHT from Paralcaligenes ureilyticus (PuDHT) toward shorter sugar acids (recording a six&#8208;fold improved activity toward the non&#8208;natural substrate D&#8208;glycerate). The successful elucidation of the role of important active site residues of the ilvD/EDD superfamily will further guide developments of this important biocatalyst for industrial applications.

         <title>Chemical and Biological Tools for the Study of Voltage&#8208;Gated Sodium Channels in Electrogenesis and Nociception</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A desire to understand the role of voltage&#8208;gated sodium channels in electrical signaling and pain perception has motivated the development of chemical and biological tools that target this protein class. Such advances are summarized in this account and future research opportunities are highlighted.







Abstract
The malfunction and misregulation of voltage&#8208;gated sodium channels (NaVs) underlie in large part the electrical hyperexcitability characteristic of chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain. NaVs are responsible for the initiation and propagation of electrical impulses (action potentials) in cells. Tissue and nerve injury alter the expression and localization of multiple NaV isoforms, including NaV1.1, 1.3, and 1.6&#8211;1.9, resulting in aberrant action potential firing patterns. To better understand the role of NaV regulation, localization, and trafficking in electrogenesis and pain pathogenesis, a number of chemical and biological reagents for interrogating NaV function have been advanced. The development and application of such tools for understanding NaV physiology are the focus of this review.

         <title>Carbonate&#8208;Based Fluorescent Chemical Tool for Uncovering Carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) Activity Variations in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the established importance of carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) in drug metabolism, methods to monitor factors that influence CES1 activity are limited. Herein, we exploit the self&#8208;immolative properties of carbonates to generate a fluorescent chemical tool and use it to identify activity differences between CES1 sequence variants in live cells.







Abstract
Carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) plays a key role in the metabolism of endogenous biomolecules and xenobiotics including a variety of pharmaceuticals. Despite the established importance of CES1 in drug metabolism, methods to study factors that can vary CES1 activity are limited with only a few suitable for use in live cells. Herein, we report the development of FCP1, a new CES1 specific fluorescent probe with a unique carbonate substrate constructed from commercially available reagents. We show that FCP&#8208;1 can specifically report on endogenous CES1 activity with a robust fluorescence response in live HepG2 cells through studies with inhibitors and genetic knockdowns. Subsequently, we deployed FCP&#8208;1 to develop a live cell fluorescence microscopy&#8208;based approach to identify activity differences between CES1 isoforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of a fluorescent probe to measure the activity of CES1 sequence variants in live cells.

         <title>Strategies to Reduce the On&#8208;Target Platelet Toxicity of Bcl&#8208;xL Inhibitors: PROTACs, SNIPERs and Prodrug&#8208;Based Approaches</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bcl&#8208;xL protein expression is essential for the survival of platelets, cancer, and senescence cells. Therefore, early&#8208;stage anticancer/senolytic Bcl&#8208;xL inhibitor designs are plagued with on&#8208;target platelet toxicity. Initial attempts with synergistic combinations allowed researchers to reduce effective Bcl&#8208;xL inhibitor dosage and related dose&#8208;dependent toxicity. As these designs presented occupancy&#8208;driven pharmacology, approaches based on event&#8208;driven pharmacology (especially protein degradation approaches: PROTACs &amp; SNIPERs) gained significant interest. Also, some prodrug strategies have been developed, which are discussed in detail in this review.







Abstract
Apoptosis is a highly regulated cellular process. Aberration in apoptosis is a common characteristic of various disorders. Therefore, proteins involved in apoptosis are prime targets in multiple therapies. Bcl&#8208;xL is an antiapoptotic protein. Compared to other antiapoptotic proteins, the expression of Bcl&#8208;xL is common in solid tumors and, to an extent, in some leukemias and lymphomas. The overexpression of Bcl&#8208;xL is also linked to survival and chemoresistance in cancer and senescent cells. Therefore, Bcl&#8208;xL is a promising anticancer and senolytic target. Various nanomolar range Bcl&#8208;xL inhibitors have been developed. ABT&#8208;263 was successfully identified as a Bcl&#8208;xL/Bcl&#8208;2 dual inhibitor. But it failed in the clinical trial (phase&#8208;II) because of its on&#8208;target platelet toxicity, which also implies an essential role of Bcl&#8208;xL protein in the survival of human platelets. Classical Bcl&#8208;xL inhibitor designs utilize occupancy&#8208;driven pharmacology with typical shortcomings (such as dose&#8208;dependent off&#8208;target and on&#8208;target platelet toxicities). Hence, event&#8208;driven pharmacology&#8208;based approaches, such as proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and SNIPERs (specific non&#8208;genetic IAP&#8208;based protein erasers) have been developed. The development of Bcl&#8208;xL based PROTACs was expected, as 600 E3&#8208;ligases are available in humans, while some (such as cereblon (CRBN), von Hippel&#8208;Lindau (VHL)) are relatively less expressed in platelets. Therefore, E3 ligase ligand&#8208;based Bcl&#8208;xL PROTACs (CRBN: XZ424, XZ739; VHL: DT2216, PZ703b, 753b) showed a significant improvement in platelet therapeutic index than their parent molecules (ABT&#8208;263: DT2216, PZ703b, 753b, XZ739, PZ15227; A1155463: XZ424). Other than their distinctive pharmacology, PROTACs are molecularly large, which limits their cell permeability and plays a role in improving their cell selectivity. We also discuss prodrug&#8208;based approaches, such as antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ABBV&#8208;155), phosphate prodrugs (APG&#8208;1252), dendrimer conjugate (AZD0466), and glycosylated conjugates (Nav&#8208;Gal). Studies of in&#8208;vitro, in&#8208;vivo, structure&#8208;activity relationships, biophysical characterization, and status of preclinical/clinical inhibitors derived from these strategies are also discussed in the review.

     alt="Strategies to Reduce the On-Target Platelet Toxicity of Bcl-xL Inhibitors: PROTACs, SNIPERs and Prodrug-Based Approaches"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bcl-x&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; protein expression&lt;/b&gt; is essential for the survival of platelets, cancer, and senescence cells. Therefore, early-stage anticancer/senolytic Bcl-x&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; inhibitor designs are plagued with on-target platelet toxicity. Initial attempts with synergistic combinations allowed researchers to reduce effective Bcl-x&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; inhibitor dosage and related dose-dependent toxicity. As these designs presented occupancy-driven pharmacology, approaches based on event-driven pharmacology (especially protein degradation approaches: PROTACs &amp; SNIPERs) gained significant interest. Also, some prodrug strategies have been developed, which are discussed in detail in this review.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apoptosis is a highly regulated cellular process. Aberration in apoptosis is a common characteristic of various disorders. Therefore, proteins involved in apoptosis are prime targets in multiple therapies. Bcl-x&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is an antiapoptotic protein. Compared to other antiapoptotic proteins, the expression of Bcl-x&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is common in solid tumors and, to an extent, in some leukemias and lymphomas. The overexpression of Bcl-x&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is also linked to survival and chemoresistance in cancer and senescent cells. Therefore, Bcl-x&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is a promising anticancer and senolytic target. Various nanomolar range Bcl-x&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; inhibitors have been developed. &lt;b&gt;ABT-263&lt;/b&gt; was successfully identified as a Bcl-x&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;/Bcl-2 dual inhibitor. But it failed in the clinical trial (phase-II) because of its on-target platelet toxicity, which also implies an essential role of Bcl-x&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; protein in the survival of human platelets. Classical Bcl-x&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; inhibitor designs utilize occupancy-driven pharmacology with typical shortcomings (such as dose-dependent off-target and on-target platelet toxicities). Hence, event-driven pharmacology-based approaches, such as &lt;i&gt;pr&lt;/i&gt;oteolysis &lt;i&gt;ta&lt;/i&gt;rgeting &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;himeras (PROTACs) and SNIPERs (&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;pecific &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;on-genetic &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;AP-based &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;rotein &lt;i&gt;er&lt;/i&gt;asers) have been developed. The development of Bcl-x&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; based PROTACs was expected, as 600 E3-ligases are available in humans, while some (such as cereblon (CRBN), von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)) are relatively less expressed in platelets. Therefore, E3 ligase ligand-based Bcl-x&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; PROTACs (CRBN: XZ424, XZ739; VHL: DT2216, PZ703b, 753b) showed a significant improvement in platelet therapeutic index than their parent molecules (&lt;b&gt;ABT-263&lt;/b&gt;: DT2216, PZ703b, 753b, XZ739, PZ15227; &lt;b&gt;A1155463&lt;/b&gt;: XZ424). Other than their distinctive pharmacology, PROTACs are molecularly large, which limits their cell permeability and plays a role in improving their cell selectivity.

         <title>Multiplexed Delivery of Synthetic (Un)Conjugatable Ubiquitin and SUMO2 Enables Simultaneous Monitoring of Their Localization and Function in Live Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Live cell imaging of post&#8208;translationally modified proteins is key to understanding their involvement in both healthy and disease states. We report multiplexed bead loading (MBL) for the simultaneous delivery of several synthetic proteins to the same cells. Using MBL, we reveal unknown involvements of ubiquitin and SUMO2 in lysosomes.







Abstract
Ubiquitin (Ub) and its related small Ub like modifier (SUMO) are among the most influential protein post&#8208;translational modifications in eukaryotes. Unfortunately, visualizing these modifications in live cells is a challenging task. Chemical protein synthesis offers great opportunities in studying and further understanding Ub and SUMO biology. Nevertheless, the low cell permeability of proteins limits these studies mainly for in&#8197;vitro applications. Here, we introduce a multiplexed protein cell delivery approach, termed MBL (multiplexed bead loading), for simultaneous loading of up to four differentially labeled proteins with organic fluorophores. We applied MBL to visualize ubiquitination and SUMOylation events in live and untransfected cells without fluorescent protein tags or perturbation to their endogenous levels. Our study reveals unprecedented involvements of Ub and SUMO2 in lysosomes depending on conjugation states. We envision that this approach will improve our understanding of dynamic cellular processes such as formation and disassembly of membraneless organelles.

         <title>Opportunities for Expanding Encoded Chemical Diversification and Improving Hit Enrichment in mRNA&#8208;Displayed Peptide Libraries</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
mRNA&#8208;displayed libraries of peptides and DNA&#8208;encoded libraries of small molecules are compared and contrasted in this review with a focus on diversification reactions and selection approaches where the former can learn from developments in the latter. We conclude by outlining a path towards approaches that may offer discovery of hybrid small&#8208;molecule peptidomimetics.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded small&#8208;molecule libraries and mRNA displayed peptide libraries both use numerically large pools of oligonucleotide&#8208;tagged molecules to identify potential hits for protein targets. They differ dramatically, however, in the &#8216;drug&#8208;likeness&#8217; of the molecules that each can be used to discover. We give here an overview of the two techniques, comparing some advantages and disadvantages of each, and suggest areas where particularly mRNA display can benefit from adopting advances developed with DNA&#8208;encoded small molecule libraries. We outline cases where chemical modification of the peptide library has already been used in mRNA display, and survey opportunities to expand this using examples from DNA&#8208;encoded small molecule libraries. We also propose potential opportunities for encoding such reactions within the mRNA/cDNA tag of an mRNA&#8208;displayed peptide library to allow a more diversity&#8208;oriented approach to library modification. Finally, we outline alternate approaches for enriching target&#8208;binding hits from a pooled and tagged library, and close by detailing several examples of how an adjusted mRNA&#8208;display based approach could be used to discover new &#8216;drug&#8208;like&#8217; modified small peptides.

         <title>Spectroscopic and in&#8197;vitro Investigations of Fe2+/&#945;&#8208;Ketoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Enzymes Involved in Nucleic Acid Repair and Modification</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinorganic perspective on the AlkB as well as the TET enzyme families, Fe2+/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenases involved in nucleic acid repair and processing, and epigenetic gene regulation is presented in this review. Important spectroscopic techniques which can be useful for in&#8197;vitro examination of the structure and formation of those proteins and their active site, of the interaction with their substrates, as well as of mechanistic details are discussed together with their advantages and limitations.







Abstract
The activation of molecular oxygen for the highly selective functionalization and repair of DNA and RNA nucleobases is achieved by &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate (&#945;&#8208;KG)/iron&#8208;dependent dioxygenases. Of special interest are the human homologues AlkBH of Escherichia coli EcAlkB and ten&#8208;eleven translocation (TET) enzymes. These enzymes are involved in demethylation or dealkylation of DNA and RNA, although additional physiological functions are continuously being found. Given their importance, studying enzyme&#8208;substrate interactions, turnover and kinetic parameters is pivotal for the understanding of the mode of action of these enzymes. Diverse analytical methods, including X&#8208;ray crystallography, UV/Vis absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy have been employed to study the changes in the active site and the overall enzyme structure upon substrate, cofactor, and inhibitor addition. Several methods are now available to assess the activity of these enzymes. By discussing limitations and possibilities of these techniques for EcAlkB, AlkBH and TET we aim to give a comprehensive synopsis from a bioinorganic point&#8208;of&#8208;view, addressing researchers from different disciplines working in the highly interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving field of epigenetic processes and DNA/RNA repair and modification.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Dioxygenases (&#945;&#8208;DOXs): Promising Biocatalysts for the Environmentally Friendly Production of Aroma Compounds</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Dioxygenases (&#945;&#8208;DOXs) are promising biocatalysts that catalyze the oxidation of fatty acids to produce (one carbon&#8208;shortened) fatty aldehydes, which are used as flavors and fragrances. This comprehensive review summarizes the recent advances in the biotechnological utilization of &#945;&#8208;DOXs with focus on newly discovered cyanobacterial &#945;&#8208;DOXs together with analytical methods to measure &#945;&#8208;DOX activity.







Abstract
Fatty aldehydes (FALs) can be derived from fatty acids (FAs) and related compounds and are frequently used as flavors and fragrances. Although chemical methods have been conventionally used, their selective biotechnological production aiming at more efficient and eco&#8208;friendly synthetic routes is in demand. &#945;&#8208;Dioxygenases (&#945;&#8208;DOXs) are heme&#8208;dependent oxidative enzymes biologically involved in the initial step of plant FA &#945;&#8208;oxidation during which molecular oxygen is incorporated into the C&#945;&#8208;position of a FA (Cn) to generate the intermediate FA hydroperoxide, which is subsequently converted into the shortened corresponding FAL (Cn&#8208;1). &#945;&#8208;DOXs are promising biocatalysts for the flavor and fragrance industries, they do not require NAD(P)H as cofactors or redox partner proteins, and they have a broad substrate scope. Here, we highlight recent advances in the biocatalytic utilization of &#945;&#8208;DOXs with emphasis on newly discovered cyanobacterial &#945;&#8208;DOXs as well as analytical methods to measure &#945;&#8208;DOX activity in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.

This comprehensive review summarizes the recent advances in the biotechnological utilization of &#945;-DOXs with focus on newly discovered cyanobacterial &#945;-DOXs together with analytical methods to measure &#945;-DOX activity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fatty aldehydes (FALs) can be derived from fatty acids (FAs) and related compounds and are frequently used as flavors and fragrances. Although chemical methods have been conventionally used, their selective biotechnological production aiming at more efficient and eco-friendly synthetic routes is in demand. &#945;-Dioxygenases (&#945;-DOXs) are heme-dependent oxidative enzymes biologically involved in the initial step of plant FA &#945;-oxidation during which molecular oxygen is incorporated into the C&lt;sub&gt;&#945;&lt;/sub&gt;-position of a FA (C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) to generate the intermediate FA hydroperoxide, which is subsequently converted into the shortened corresponding FAL (C&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;). &#945;-DOXs are promising biocatalysts for the flavor and fragrance industries, they do not require NAD(P)H as cofactors or redox partner proteins, and they have a broad substrate scope. Here, we highlight recent advances in the biocatalytic utilization of &#945;-DOXs with emphasis on newly discovered cyanobacterial &#945;-DOXs as well as analytical methods to measure &#945;-DOX activity &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Activities of Oxidation and Oxidative Decarboxylation by Flavoenzymes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual functions by a single active site are found in flavoenzyme oxidases. This is the first review to discuss and compare the reaction mechanisms of flavoenzymes catalyzing both oxidation and oxidative decarboxylation of l&#8208;amino acids and &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid. Recurrent features and factor controlling oxidative decarboxylation are proposed.







Abstract
Specific flavoenzyme oxidases catalyze oxidative decarboxylation in addition to their classical oxidation reactions in the same active sites. The mechanisms underlying oxidative decarboxylation by these enzymes and how they control their two activities are not clearly known. This article reviews the current state of knowledge of four enzymes from the l&#8208;amino acid oxidase and l&#8208;hydroxy acid oxidase families, including l&#8208;tryptophan 2&#8208;monooxygenase, l&#8208;phenylalanine 2&#8208;oxidase and l&#8208;lysine oxidase/monooxygenase and lactate monooxygenase which catalyze substrate oxidation and oxidative decarboxylation. Apart from specific interactions to allow substrate oxidation by the flavin cofactor, specific binding of oxidized product in the active sites appears to be important for enabling subsequent decarboxylation by these enzymes. Based on recent findings of l&#8208;lysine oxidase/monooxygenase, we propose that nucleophilic attack of H2O2 on the imino acid product is the mechanism enabling oxidative decarboxylation.

         <title>Strategies for Interference of Insulin Fibrillogenesis: Challenges and Advances</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite of the fact that the world is celebrating the 100th year of the discovery of insulin, advancement in the domain of insulin stabilization remains unsaturated. An efficient, simpler, and an economically favorable solution is always welcome. This review will be useful for a broad range of researchers working in the development of aggregation&#8208;free insulin formulations or insulin analogues.







Abstract
The discovery of insulin came with very high hopes for diabetic patients. In 2021, the world celebrated the 100th anniversary of the discovery of this vital hormone. However, external use of insulin is highly affected by its aggregating tendency that occurs during its manufacturing, transportation, and improper handling which ultimately leads to its pharmaceutically and biologically ineffective form. In this review, we aim to discuss the various approaches used for decelerating insulin aggregation which results in the enhancement of its overall structural stability and usage. The approaches that are discussed are broadly classified as either a measure through excipient additions or by intrinsic modifications in the insulin native structure.

         <title>Oxidative Stress in Cancer Therapy: Friend or Enemy?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative stress and the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells is described in this review, followed by discussion of the therapeutic strategies focused on ROS levels for cancer therapy. Clinically approved drugs with oxidative stress anticancer mechanisms of action are described and examples of metal&#8208;based anticancer drug candidates with such mechanisms of action are highlighted.







Abstract
Excessive cellular oxidative stress is widely perceived as a key factor in pathophysiological conditions and cancer development. Healthy cells use several mechanisms to maintain intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and overall redox homeostasis to avoid damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids. Cancer cells, in contrast, exhibit elevated ROS levels and upregulated protective antioxidant pathways. Counterintuitively, such elevated oxidative stress and enhanced antioxidant defence mechanisms in cancer cells provide a therapeutic opportunity for the development of drugs with different anticancer mechanisms of action (MoA). In this review, oxidative stress and the role of ROS in cells are described. The tumour&#8208;suppressive and tumour&#8208;promotive functions of ROS are discussed, and these two different therapeutic strategies (increasing or decreasing ROS to fight cancer) are compared. Clinically approved drugs with demonstrated oxidative stress anticancer MoAs are highlighted followed by description of examples of metal&#8208;based anticancer drug candidates causing oxidative stress in cancer cells via novel MoAs.

         <title>Biocatalytic Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Promising Materials for Biosensing</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with porous networks and attractive functions have been intelligently employed as supports to encase enzymes and protect them against harsh environments. More importantly, customizable construction and composition affords the intrinsic enzyme&#8208;like activity of some MOFs (known as nanozymes), which provides an alternative guideline for constructing robust enzyme mimics. This review will introduce the concept of these biocatalytic MOFs, with special emphasis on how the biocatalytic processes operate in these materials can reverse the plight of native enzyme&#8208;based biosensing.







Abstract
The highly efficient and specific catalysis of enzymes allows them to recognize a myriad of substrates, which enables biosensing. However, the fragility of natural enzymes severely restricts their practical applications.

More importantly, customizable construction and composition affords the intrinsic enzyme&#8208;like activity of some MOFs (known as nanozymes), which provides an alternative route for the construction of robust enzyme mimics.

         <title>Modern Strategies for the Diversification of the Supply of Natural Compounds: The Case of Alkaloid Painkillers</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alkaloid pharmaceuticals supply&#8208;chain is highly dependent on opium poppy harvest. The biosynthesis of alkaloid painkillers encounters its first bottleneck in the enzymatic Pictet&#8208;Spengler stereoselective condensation of 4&#8208;HPAA and dopamine, to synthesize S&#8208;norcoclaurine. The enzyme mechanisms and possible methodology for the improvement of their efficiency are discussed in this review.







Abstract
Plant&#8208;derived natural compounds have been used for treating diseases since prehistorical times. The supply of many plant&#8208;derived natural compounds for medicinal purposes, such as thebaine, morphine, and codeine, is primarily dependent on opium poppy crop harvesting. This dependency adds an extra risk factor to ensuring the supply chain because crops are highly susceptible to environmental conditions. Emerging technologies, such as biocatalysis, might help to solve this problem by diversifying the sources of supply of these compounds. Here we review the first committed step in the production of alkaloid painkillers, the production of S&#8208;norcoclaurine, and the enzymes involved. The improvement of these enzymes can be carried out experimentally by directed evolution and rational design strategies, supported by computational methods, to create variants that produce the S&#8208;norcoclaurine precursor for alkaloid painkillers in heterologous organisms, meeting the pharmaceutical industry standards and needs without depending on opium poppy crops.

         <title>A Specialized Dehydrogenase Provides l&#8208;Phenyllactate for FR900359 Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dehydrogenase FrsC is involved in biosynthesis of the Gq protein inhibiting natural product FR900359. Here, we biochemically characterized FrsC, catalyzing the formation of l&#8208;phenyllactate, and its subsequent incorporation into the FR assembly line followed by epimerization. A detailed bioinformatic analysis revealed that FrsC has evolved from primary metabolic enzymes to a specialized reductase accepting only aromatic substrates.







Abstract
d&#8208;Phenyllactate (PLA) is a component of the selective Gq protein inhibitor and nonribosomal cyclic depsipeptide FR900359 (FR). Here we report a detailed biochemical investigation of PLA biosynthesis and its incorporation into the natural product FR. The enzyme FrsC, member of the lactate/malate dehydrogenase superfamily, was shown to catalyze the formation of l&#8208;PLA from phenylpyruvate. FrsC was kinetically characterized and its substrate specificity determined. Incorporation of l&#8208;PLA was probed by assaying the adenylation domain FrsE&#8208;A3 and feeding studies with a Chromobacterium vaccinii &#916;frsC mutant, confirming preferred activation of l&#8208;PLA followed by on&#8208;line epimerization to d&#8208;PLA. Finally, detailed bioinformatic analyses of FrsC revealed its close relation to malate dehydrogenases from primary metabolism and suggest extensions in the substrate binding loop to be responsible for its adaptation to accepting larger aromatic substrates with high specificity.

         <title>What is the Sugar Code?</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Information coding by sugars: Letting symbols convey information comes in many forms such as the QR code. We explain that sugars are an ideal alphabet of life. They form an unsurpassed size of bio&#8208;vocabulary. It is read and translated by a matching diversity of sugar receptors (lectins) so that establishing a dictionary for the glyco&#8208;vocabulary is now in progress. The given QR code directs you to our review on the sugar code.







Abstract
A code is defined by the nature of the symbols, which are used to generate information&#8208;storing combinations (e.&#8201;g. oligo&#8208; and polymers). Like nucleic acids and proteins, oligo&#8208; and polysaccharides are ubiquitous, and they are a biochemical platform for establishing molecular messages. Of note, the letters of the sugar code system (third alphabet of life) excel in coding capacity by making an unsurpassed versatility for isomer (code word) formation possible by variability in anomery and linkage position of the glycosidic bond, ring size and branching. The enzymatic machinery for glycan biosynthesis (writers) realizes this enormous potential for building a large vocabulary. It includes possibilities for dynamic editing/erasing as known from nucleic acids and proteins. Matching the glycome diversity, a large panel of sugar receptors (lectins) has developed based on more than a dozen folds. Lectins &#8216;read&#8217; the glycan&#8208;encoded information. Hydrogen/coordination bonding and ionic pairing together with stacking and C&#8722;H/&#960;&#8208;interactions as well as modes of spatial glycan presentation underlie the selectivity and specificity of glycan&#8208;lectin recognition. Modular design of lectins together with glycan display and the nature of the cognate glycoconjugate account for the large number of post&#8208;binding events. They give an entry to the glycan vocabulary its functional, often context&#8208;dependent meaning(s), hereby building the dictionary of the sugar code.
