      <title>OCRE Domains of Splicing Factors RBM5 and RBM10: Tyrosine Ring Flip Frequencies by Integrated Use of 1H&#8208;NMR and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract:&#160;  &#160;The 55&#8208;residue OCRE domains of the splicing factors RBM5 and RBM10 contain 15 tyrosines in compact, globular folds.

      <title>Molecular basis of the antiangiogenic action of rosmarinic acid, a natural compound targeting Fibroblast Growth Factor&#8208;2/FGFR interactions</title>
      <dc:description>Fibroblast growth factor (FGF2)/Fibroblast growth factor Receptor (FGFR) signalling plays a major role both in physiology and in several pathologies, including cancer development, metastasis formation and resistance to therapy. The development of small molecules, acting extracellularly to target FGF2/FGFR interactions, has the advantage of limiting adverse effects associated to the current intracellular FGFR inhibitors. Here we discuss the ability of the natural compound rosmarinic acid (RA) to induce FGF2/FGFR complex dissociation. The molecular level description of FGF2/FGFR/RA system, by NMR and docking, clearly demonstrates that RA binds to FGFR&#8208;D2 domain and directly competes with FGF2 for the same binding site. Both direct and allosteric perturbations concur to destabilize the complex. The proposed molecular mechanism is validated by cellular studies showing that RA inhibits FGF2&#8208;induced endothelial cells proliferation and FGFR activation. Our results can serve as the basis for the development of new extracellular inhibitors of the FGF/FGFR pathways.</dc:description>

      <title>Photocaged Hoechst enables subnuclear visualization and cell selective staining of DNA in vivo</title>
      <dc:description>Selective targeting of DNA by means of fluorescent labelling has become a mainstay in the life sciences. While genetic engineering serves as a powerful technique and allows for the visualization of nucleic acid by using DNA&#8208;targeting fluorescent fusion proteins in a cell&#8208;type and subcellular specific manner, it relies on the introduction of foreign genes. On the other hand, DNA&#8208;binding small fluorescent molecules can be used without genetic engineering but they are not spatially restricted. Here, we report a photocaged version of the DNA dye Hoechst33342 (pcHoechst), which can be uncaged using UV to blue light for the selective staining of chromosomal DNA in subnuclear regions of live cells. Expanding its application to a vertebrate model organism, we demonstrate uncaging in epithelial cells and short&#8208;term cell tracking&#160;  in vivo&#160;  in zebrafish. We envision pcHoechst as a valuable tool for targeting and interrogating DNA with precise spatiotemporal resolution in living cells and wild&#8208;type organisms.</dc:description>

      <title>Characterization of apo&#8208;form selective inhibition of indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase.</title>
      <dc:description>Indoleamine&#8208;2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a heme&#8208;containing enzyme that catalyzes the rate&#8208;limiting step in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan (TRP) metabolism. As an inflammation&#8208;induced immunoregulatory enzyme, pharmacological inhibition of IDO1 activity is currently being pursued as a potential therapeutic tool for the treatment of cancer and other disease states. As such, a detailed understanding of the mechanism of action of established and novel IDO1 inhibitors remains of great interest. Comparison of a newly&#8208;developed IDO1 inhibitor (GSK5628) to the existing best&#8208;in&#8208;class compound, epacadostat (Incyte), allows us to report on a unique inhibition mechanism for IDO1. Here, we demonstrate that GSK5628 inhibits IDO1 by competing with heme for binding to a heme&#8208;free conformation of the enzyme (apo&#8208;IDO1) while epacadostat coordinates its binding with the iron atom of the IDO1 heme cofactor. Comparison of these two compounds in cellular systems reveals a long&#8208;lasting inhibitory effect of GSK5628, undescribed for other known IDO1 inhibitors. Detailed characterization of this apo&#8208;binding mechanism for IDO1 inhibition may help design superior inhibitors or may confer a unique competitive advantage over other IDO1 inhibitors vis&#8208;&#225;&#8208;vis specificity and pharmacokinetic parameters.</dc:description>

Here,  Nostoc punctiforme  PCC73102 (  Npu  ) DnaE intein was engineered to have an altered split position. An eleven residue N&#8208;intein of DnaE in which Gly and Asp were substituted for Tyr and Glu at positions 4 and 5, respectively, was designed, and the active C&#8208;intein variants were acquired by a GFP fluorescence&#8208;based screening. The designed N&#8208;intein and the obtained active C&#8208;intein variants were used to construct a turn&#8208;on system for the enzyme activities such as human immunodeficiency 1 protease and NanoLuc luciferase. Based on the NanoLuc&#8208;intein fusion, we developed two intein pairs, each of which is capable of reacting preferentially, by interchanging the charged amino acids upon N&#8208; and C&#8208;inteins.

      <title>Fc&#8208;binding antibody&#8208;recruiting molecules targeting prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen:&#160;defucosylation of antibody for efficacy improvement</title>
      <dc:description>Synthetic small molecules that redirect endogenous antibodies to target cells are promising drug candidates because they overcome the potential shortcomings of therapeutic antibodies, such as immunogenicity&#160;and the need for intravenous delivery. Previously, we reported a novel class of bispecific molecules targeting the antibody Fc region and folate receptor, named Fc&#8208;binding antibody&#8208;recruiting molecules (Fc&#8208;ARMs). Fc&#8208;ARMs can theoretically recruit most endogenous antibodies, inducing cancer cell elimination via antibody&#8208;dependent cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Here, we describe new Fc&#8208;ARMs that target prostate cancer (Fc&#8208;ARM&#8208;Ps). Fc&#8208;ARM&#8208;Ps recruited antibodies to cancer cells expressing&#160;prostate&#8208;specific membraneantigen but did so with lower efficiency compared with Fc&#8208;ARMs targeting folate receptor. Upon recruitment by Fc&#8208;ARM&#8208;P, defucosylated antibodies efficiently activated natural killer cells and induced ADCC, whereas antibodies with intact N&#8208;glycans did not. The results suggest that the affinity between recruited antibodies and CD16a, a type of Fc receptor expressed on immune cells, could be a key factor controlling immune activation in the Fc&#8208;ARM strategy.</dc:description>

The results suggest that the affinity between recruited antibodies and CD16a, a type of Fc receptor expressed on immune cells, could be a key factor controlling immune activation in the Fc&#8208;ARM strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>The utilities of an &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactone (MeLac) moiety as a warhead composed of multiple electrophilic sites are reported. We demonstrate that a MeLac&#8208;alkyne not only reacts with diverse proteins as a broadly reactive measurement probe but also recruits endogenous reduced glutathione (GSH) to assemble a selective chemical probe of GSH&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactone (GSH&#8208;Lac)&#8208;alkyne in live cells. Tandem mass spectrometry reveals that MeLac reacts with nucleophilic cysteine, serine, lysine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, through either Michael addition or acyl addition. A peptide&#8208;centric proteomics platform demonstrates that the proteomic selectivity profiles of orlistat and parthenolide, which have distinct reactivities, are measurable by MeLac&#8208;alkyne as a high&#8208;coverage&#160;probe. The GSH&#8208;Lac&#8208;alkyne selectively probes the glutathione S&#8208;transferase P responsible for multidrug resistance.

      <title>Comparison of Bioorthogonal &#946;&#8208;Lactone Activity&#8208;Based Probes for Selective Labeling of Penicillin&#8208;Binding Proteins</title>
      <dc:description>Penicillin&#8208;binding proteins (PBPs) are a family of bacterial enzymes that are key components of cell wall biosynthesis and the target of &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics. Most microbial pathogens contain multiple structurally homologous PBP isoforms, making it difficult to target individual PBPs. To study the roles and regulation of specific PBP isoforms, a panel of bioorthogonal &#946;&#8208;lactone probes was synthesized and compared. Fluorescent labeling confirmed selectivity, and PBPs were selectively enriched from  Streptococcus pneumoniae  lysates. Comparisons between fluorescent labeling of probes revealed that the accessibility of bioorthogonal reporter molecules to the bound probe in the native protein environment exerts a more significant effect on labeling intensity than the bioorthogonal reaction used, observations which are likely applicable beyond this class of probes or proteins. Selective, bioorthogonal activity&#8208;based probes for PBPs will facilitate the activity&#8208;based determination of the roles and regulation of specific PBP isoforms, a key gap in knowledge which has yet to be filled.</dc:description>

      <title>Site&#8208;Specific Incorporation of a Photoactivatable Fluorescent Amino Acid</title>
      <dc:description>Photoactivatable fluorophores are emerging optical probes for biological applications. Most photoactivatable fluorophores are relatively large in size and need to be activated using ultraviolet light, dramatically limiting their applications. To introduce photoactivatable fluorophores into proteins, recent investigations have explored several protein labeling technologies, including fluorescein arsenical hairpin (FlAsH) Tag, HaloTag labeling, SNAPTag labeling, and bioorthogonal conjugation. However, these techniques require a multi&#8208;step labeling process. Here, by using Genetic Code Expansion and a single sulfur&#8208;for&#8208;oxygen atom replacement within an existing fluorescent amino acid, we have site&#8208;specifically incorporated the photoactivatable fluorescent amino acid thioacridonylalanine (SAcd) into proteins in a single step. Moreover, upon exposure to visible light, SAcd can be efficiently desulfurized to its oxo derivatives, thus restoring the strong fluorescence of labeled proteins.</dc:description>

      <title>Selective Affimers Recognize the BCL&#8208;2 Family Proteins BCL&#8208;xL and MCL&#8208;1 through Non&#8208;Canonical Structural Motifs</title>
      <dc:description>The BCL&#8208;2 family is a challenging group of proteins to target selectively due to sequence and structural homologies across the family. Selective ligands for the BCL&#8208;2 family regulators of apoptosis are useful as probes to understand cell biology and apoptotic signalling pathways, and as starting points for inhibitor design. We have used phage display to isolate Affimer reagents (non&#8208;antibody binding proteins based on a conserved scaffold) to identify ligands for MCL&#8208;1, BCL&#8208;xL, BCL&#8208;2, BAK and BAX, then used multiple biophysical characterisation methods to probe the interactions. We established that purified Affimers elicit selective recognition of their target BCL&#8208;2 protein. For anti&#8208;apoptotic targets BCL&#8208;xL and MCL&#8208;1, competitive inhibition of their canonical protein&#8208;protein interactions is demonstrated. Co&#8208;crystal structures reveal an unprecedented mode of molecular recognition; where a BH3 helix is normally bound, flexible loops from the Affimer dock into the BH3 binding cleft. Moreover, the Affimers induce a change in the target proteins towards a desirable drug bound like conformation. These proof of concept studies indicate that Affimers could be used as alternative templates to inspire design of selective BCL&#8208;2 family modulators and more generally other protein&#8208;protein interaction inhibitors.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemical Translational Biology&#8208;Guided Molecular Diagnostics: The Front Line To Mediate the Current SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Pandemic</title>
      <dc:description>
Stronger together: A combination of biological components and chemical strategies is the fundamental construction principle for molecular diagnostic systems. The current unprecedented pandemic highlights the significance of chemical translational biology, by which the imperative demand for a simple and rapid point&#8208;of&#8208;care system to militate against the spread of COVID&#8208;19 can be satisfied.







Abstract
The spread of severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) has disrupted our global society in unprecedented ways. The very front line in defense against this pandemic is molecular diagnosis, which is an exceptional representation of how chemical translational biology can benefit our lives. In this viewpoint, I emphasize the imperative demand for a simple and rapid point&#8208;of&#8208;care system in order to mediate the spread of COVID&#8208;19. I further describe how the interdisciplinary combination of chemistry and biology advances biosensing systems, which potentially lead to integrated and automated point&#8208;of&#8208;care systems capable of relieving the current pandemic.

      <title>A Step toward Molecular Evolution of RNA: Ribose Binds to Prebiotic Fatty Acid Membranes, and Nucleosides Bind Better than Individual Bases Do</title>
      <dc:description>
Membranes set the stage for RNA formation. RNA is a polymer of bases, sugar (ribose), and phosphate. Binding of these building blocks to prebiotic, fatty&#8208;acid membranes may have facilitated RNA's formation. On their own, some bases bind weakly to membranes, whereas a base linked to ribose or phosphoribose binds more strongly. Thus, simple membranes could have selected and concentrated linked versions of RNA's building blocks prior to their polymerization. More information can be found in the communication by R.&#8197;A. Black et&#8197;al.

      <title>Engineering of Thermostable &#946;&#8208;Hydroxyacid Dehydrogenase for the Asymmetric Reduction of Imines</title>
      <dc:description>
Get more from your enzyme: A &#946;&#8208;hydroxyacid dehydrogenase from Thermocrinus albus was engineered to accept two different imine compounds as substrates. The variants were applied to biocatalytic asymmetric reductions at elevated temperatures leading to an enhanced product formation.







Abstract
The &#946;&#8208;hydroxyacid dehydrogenase from Thermocrinus albus (Ta&#8208;&#946;HAD), which catalyzes the NADP+&#8208;dependent oxidation of &#946;&#8208;hydroxyacids, was engineered to accept imines as substrates. The catalytic activity of the proton&#8208;donor variant K189D was further increased by the introduction of two nonpolar flanking residues (N192&#8197;L, N193&#8197;L). Engineering the putative alternative proton donor (D258S) and the gate&#8208;keeping residue (F250&#8197;A) led to a switched substrate specificity as compared to the single and triple variants. The two most active Ta&#8208;&#946;HAD variants were applied to biocatalytic asymmetric reductions of imines at elevated temperatures and enabled enhanced product formation at a reaction temperature of 50&#8201;&#176;C.

      <dc:description>The advent of bioorthogonal chemistry has led to the development of powerful chemical tools enabling increasingly ambitious applications. In particular, these tools have made possible to achieve what is considered as the holy grail of many researchers involved in chemical biology: to perform non&#8208;natural chemical reactions within living organisms. In this minireview, we present an update of bioorthogonal reactions that have been carried out in animals for various applications. We outline the advances made in the understanding of fundamental biological processes and the development of innovative imaging and therapeutic strategies using bioorthogonal chemistry.</dc:description>

In particular, these tools have made possible to achieve what is considered as the holy grail of many researchers involved in chemical biology: to perform non&#8208;natural chemical reactions within living organisms. In this minireview, we present an update of bioorthogonal reactions that have been carried out in animals for various applications. We outline the advances made in the understanding of fundamental biological processes and the development of innovative imaging and therapeutic strategies using bioorthogonal chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Stapled Peptide Inhibitors of Autophagy Adapter LC3B</title>
      <dc:description>
For natural ligands of the human autophagy adaptor protein LC3B, the key recognition motif binds in an extended conformation (upper left). We report extensive structure&#8211;activity relationships for this important protein&#8211;protein interaction. We also used this information to design an artificial &#8220;staple&#8221; (shown in orange) that improves the binding and biological properties of the ligand peptides.

      <title>Chemical Proteomics for Expanding the Druggability of Human Disease</title>
      <dc:description>
Interacting with interactions: Chemical proteomics has taken shape as a powerful technique that seeks to understand small&#8208;molecule and protein function in the physiological system. Chemical proteomics that integrates activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) technology with mass spectrometry has been introduced to evaluate small&#8208;molecule and protein interaction and expand the druggable proteome.







Abstract
Abstract. Over the past decade, chemical proteomics has emerged as a powerful technique to understand small molecule and protein function in the physiological system and plays a key role in unravelling the cellular targets of pharmacological modulators. Chemical proteomics that integrates activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) with mass spectrometry has been introduced to evaluate small&#8208;molecule and protein interaction and expand the druggable proteome. A much larger fraction of the human proteome can now be targeted by small molecules than estimated by past predictions of protein druggability.

      <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: A New Platform for Enzyme Immobilization</title>
      <dc:description>
Freeze frame: Enzyme immobilization is an emerging technology that can overcome the inherently fragile nature of enzymes. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold great promise as ideal matrices for enzyme immobilization. In this concept, we will impart the typical strategies to construct enzymes@MOFs, as well as their characteristics and potential applications.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with attractive properties such as high surface area, tunable porosity, designable functionality and excellent stability, have aroused great interest from researchers as the matrices for enzyme immobilization. Recently, several efficient strategies including surface immobilization, post&#8208;synthetic infiltration and in&#8197;situ encapsulation have been explored. MOF&#8208;immobilized enzymes, named enzymes@MOFs, show remarkably enhanced stability and recyclability, accelerating cell&#8208;free biocatalysis in diverse applications. This concept will impart the typical strategies for enzyme immobilization with MOFs, and their potential applications.

      <title>The in Vitro Antiplasmodial and Antiproliferative Activity of New Ferrocene&#8208;Based &#945;&#8208;Aminocresols Targeting Hemozoin Inhibition and DNA Interaction</title>
      <dc:description>
Multitarget attack: Compounds incorporating ferrocene in a aminocresol scaffold showed antiplasmodial and anticancer activity. SAR studies revealed that an OH group and rotatable C&#8211;NH bond are vital for biological activity, with spectrophotometric techniques and docking simulations suggesting a dual mode of action involving hemozoin inhibition and DNA interaction. Targeting multiple pathways could delay the development of clinical resistance.







Abstract
The conjugation of organometallic complexes to known bioactive organic frameworks is a proven strategy revered for devising new drug molecules with novel modes of action. This approach holds great promise for the generation of potent drug leads in the quest for therapeutic chemotypes with the potential to overcome the development of clinical resistance. Herein, we present the in&#8197;vitro antiplasmodial and antiproliferative investigation of ferrocenyl &#945;&#8208;aminocresol conjugates assembled by amalgamation of the organometallic ferrocene unit and an &#945;&#8208;aminocresol scaffold possessing antimalarial activity. The compounds pursued in the study exhibited higher toxicity towards the chemosensitive (3D7) and &#8208;resistant (Dd2) strains of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite than to the human HCC70 triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cell line. Indication of cross&#8208;resistance was absent for the compounds evaluated against the multi&#8208;resistant Dd2 strain. Structure&#8208;activity analysis revealed that the phenolic hydroxy group and rotatable &#963; bond between the &#945;&#8208;carbon and NH group of the &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;o&#8208;cresol skeleton are crucial for the biological activity of the compounds. Spectrophotometric techniques and in silico docking simulations performed on selected derivatives suggest that the compounds show a dual mode of action involving hemozoin inhibition and DNA interaction via minor&#8208;groove binding. Lastly, compound 9&#8201;a, identified as a possible lead, exhibited preferential binding for the plasmodial DNA isolated from 3D7 P. falciparum trophozoites over the mammalian calf thymus DNA, thereby substantiating the enhanced antiplasmodial activity of the compounds. The presented research demonstrates the strategy of incorporating organometallic complexes into known biologically active organic scaffolds as a viable avenue to fashion novel multimodal compounds with potential to counter the development drug resistance.

      <title>A PNA&#8208;DNA2 Triple&#8208;Helix Molecular Switch&#8208;Based Colorimetric Sensor for Sensitive and Specific Detection of microRNAs from Cancer Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Point&#8208;of&#8208;care cancer catching? A novel PNA&#8208;DNA2 triplex consisting of a homopurine PNA strand and two homopyrimidine DNA strands is reported for the first time. On the basis of this phenomenon, a simple, inexpensive colorimetric PNA&#8208;DNA2 triple&#8208;helix molecular switch&#8208;based sensing platform for sensitive and selective detection of miRNAs from cancer cells is demonstrated.







Abstract
Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), the synthetic DNA mimics that can bind to oligonucleotides to form duplexes, triplexes, and quadruplexes, could be advantageous as probes for nucleic acid sequences owing to their unique physicochemical and biochemical properties. We have found that a homopurine PNA strand could bind to two homopyrimidine DNA strands to form a PNA&#8208;DNA2 triplex. Moreover, the cyanine dye DiSC2(5) could bind with high affinity to this triplex and cause a noticeable color change. On the basis of this phenomenon, we have designed a label&#8208;free colorimetric sensing platform for miRNAs from cancer cells by using a PNA&#8208;DNA2 triple&#8208;helix molecular switch (THMS) and DiSC2(5). This sensing platform can detect miRNA&#8208;21 specifically with a detection limit of 0.18&#8197;nM, which is comparable to that of the THMS&#8208;mediated fluorescence sensing platform. Moreover, this colorimetric platform does not involve any chemical modification or enzymatic signal amplification, which boosts its applicability and availability at the point of care in resource&#8208;limited settings. The universality of this approach can be simply achieved by altering the sequences of the probe DNA for specific targets.

      <title>A Sweet Galactose Transfer: Metabolic Oligosaccharide Engineering as a Tool To Study Glycans in Plasmodium Infection</title>
      <dc:description>
Plasmodium glycobiology: The use of artificial galactose derivatives and labelling through iEDDA reaction in the liver stage of Plasmodium infection showed increased uptake in infected hepatic cells, through participation of GLUT1 transporters. Furthermore, unprotected derivatives are transferred from the mosquito host to the Plasmodium berghei parasite. This strategy has the potential to provide new insights into Plasmodium glycobiology.







Abstract
The introduction of chemical reporter groups into glycan structures through metabolic oligosaccharide engineering (MOE) followed by bio&#8208;orthogonal ligation is an important tool to study glycosylation. We show the incorporation of synthetic galactose derivatives that bear terminal alkene groups in hepatic cells, with and without infection by Plasmodium berghei parasites, the causative agent of malaria. Additionally, we demonstrated the contribution of GLUT1 to the transport of these galactose derivatives, and observed a consistent increase in the uptake of these compounds going from na&#239;ve to P. berghei&#8208;infected cells. Finally, we used MOE to study the interplay between Plasmodium parasites and their mosquito hosts, to reveal a possible transfer of galactose building blocks from the latter to the former. This strategy has the potential to provide new insights into Plasmodium glycobiology as well as for the identification and characterization of key glycan structures for further vaccine development.

      <title>Efficient Synthesis of Phenylacetate and 2&#8208;Phenylethanol by Modular Cascade Biocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Green and sustainable synthesis of chemicals from renewable feedstocks is emerging as an alternative approach to petroleum&#8208;based chemical synthesis. In this work, a one&#8208;pot cascade biotransformation was developed to efficiently synthesize 2&#8208;phenylethanol and phenylacetic acid from biobased l&#8208;phenylalanine, tyrosol and p&#8208;hydroxyphenylacetic acid from biobased l&#8208;tyrosine.







Abstract
The green and sustainable synthesis of chemicals from renewable feedstocks by a biotransformation approach has gained increasing attention in recent years. In this work, we developed enzymatic cascades to efficiently convert l&#8208;phenylalanine into 2&#8208;phenylethanol (2&#8208;PE) and phenylacetic acid (PAA), l&#8208;tyrosine into tyrosol (p&#8208;hydroxyphenylethanol, p&#8208;HPE) and p&#8208;hydroxyphenylacetic acid (p&#8208;HPAA). The enzymatic cascade was cast into an aromatic aldehyde formation module, followed by an aldehyde reduction module, or aldehyde oxidation module, to achieve one&#8208;pot biotransformation by using recombinant Escherichia coli. Biotransformation of 50&#8197;mM l&#8208;Phe produced 6.76&#8197;g/L PAA with more than 99&#8201;% conversion and 5.95&#8197;g/L of 2&#8208;PE with 97&#8201;% conversion. The bioconversion efficiencies of p&#8208;HPAA and p&#8208;HPE from l&#8208;Tyr reached to 88 and 94&#8201;%, respectively. In addition, m&#8208;fluoro&#8208;phenylalanine was further employed as an unnatural aromatic amino acid substrate to obtain m&#8208;fluoro&#8208;phenylacetic acid; &gt;96&#8201;% conversion was achieved. Our results thus demonstrated high&#8208;yielding and potential industrial synthesis of above aromatic compounds by one&#8208;pot cascade biocatalysis.

      <title>Could We Really Be Made of Swiss Cheese? Xenobiology as an Engineering Epistemology for Biological Realization</title>
      <dc:description>
Possible building blocks of life: According to the multiple realizability thesis in the philosophy of science, there should exist radically different ways to build systems with the functions we value in complex life. Xenobiology's exploration of the viability of unfamiliar biochemistries provides the first serious empirical test of this idea.







Abstract
Besides having potential medical and biosafety applications, as well as challenging the foundations of biological engineering, xenobiology can also shed light on the epistemological and metaphysical questions that puzzle philosophers of science. This paper reviews this philosophical aspect of xenobiology, focusing on the possible multiple realizability of life. According to this hypothesis, what ultimately matters in understanding life is its function, not its particular building blocks. This is because there should, in theory, be many different ways to build the same function. The possibility of multiple realizability was originally raised in the context of AI's hypothesized capacity to realize mental functions. Because we still do not have any incontrovertible examples of digital minds, not to mention alien life of foreign biochemistry, the best way to test this philosophical idea is to examine the recent results and practices of synthetic biology and xenobiology.

Nanozymes for biosensing: Nanozymes are a class of nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like properties. Many of them including noble metal&#8208;, metal oxide&#8208;, carbon&#8208;, and metal complex&#8208;based nanozymes have demonstrated the ability to detect pathogenic micro&#8208;organisms.

Abstract
Infectious diseases are among the world's principal health problems. It is crucial to develop rapid, accurate and cost&#8208;effective methods for the detection of pathogenic microorganisms. Recently, considerable progress has been achieved in the field of inorganic enzyme mimics (nanozymes). Compared with natural enzymes, nanozymes have higher stability and lower cost. More interestingly, their properties can be designed for various demands. Herein, we introduce the latest research progress on the detection of pathogenic microorganisms by using various nanozymes. We also discuss the current challenges of nanozymes in biosensing and provide some strategies to overcome these barriers.

      <title>Intersecting Xenobiology and Neometabolism To Bring Novel Chemistries to Life</title>
      <dc:description>
Outside the box: Xenoelements can be incorporated into the chemistry of microbial cells by combining several approaches. Engineered hosts are programmed through neometabolism to accept nonbiological atoms, incorporated into xenometabolites. Some of these molecules are added&#8208;value chemicals in themselves; others (e.&#8201;g., modified amino acids) can be integrated into proteins to explore emergence of novel functions.







Abstract
The diversity of life relies on a handful of chemical elements (carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus) as part of essential building blocks; some other atoms are needed to a lesser extent, but most of the remaining elements are excluded from biology. This circumstance limits the scope of biochemical reactions in extant metabolism &#8211; yet it offers a phenomenal playground for synthetic biology. Xenobiology aims to bring novel bricks to life that could be exploited for (xeno)metabolite synthesis. In particular, the assembly of novel pathways engineered to handle nonbiological elements (neometabolism) will broaden chemical space beyond the reach of natural evolution. In this review, xeno&#8208;elements that could be blended into nature's biosynthetic portfolio are discussed together with their physicochemical properties and tools and strategies to incorporate them into biochemistry. We argue that current bioproduction methods can be revolutionized by bridging xenobiology and neometabolism for the synthesis of new&#8208;to&#8208;nature molecules, such as organohalides.

      <title>Synthesis and Metabolic Fate of 4&#8208;Methylthiouridine in Bacterial tRNA</title>
      <dc:description>
The cover feature picture shows a tRNA that is being transported through the bacterial &#8220;RNA maintenance factory&#8221; after being damaged through direct methylation. Here, we report how E. coli classifies RNA damage into three major categories. The first class of damage, such as 7&#8208;methylguanosine is being ignored by the bacterium. The second class, for example, 2&#8208;methylthiocytidine, is repaired through enzymatic demethylation. In the front, our newly discovered RNA damage, 4&#8208;methylthiouridine, is shown; this is lost from tRNA through an as yet unknown mechanism. More information can be found in the communication by S. Kellner et&#8197;al.

      <title>Zinc Deficiency Leads to Lipid Changes in Drosophila Brain Similar to Cognitive&#8208;Impairing Drugs: An Imaging Mass Spectrometry Study</title>
      <dc:description>
The cover feature picture shows the importance of zinc in altering lipid composition in cellular membranes, which affects signal transduction inside the brain. Mass spectrometry imaging was used to show that zinc deficiency changes lipid composition and lipid abundance in the brain of Drosophila and the changes are similar to those caused by cognitive&#8208;impairing drugs. More information can be found in the communication by A.&#8197;G. Ewing et&#8197;al.

      <title>Surface Ligand&#8208;Density Switches Glycovesicles Between Monomeric and Multimeric Lectin Recognitions</title>
      <dc:description>Carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions define multitude of cellular recognition events. We present herein synthetic glycovesicles as cell surface mimics in order to switch the nature of the lectin recognitions. The covalent glycovesicles, constituted with diacetylene monomers of varying ligand densities at their surfaces, are prepared through photo&#8208;polymerization. Vesicles imbedded with sparsely populated ligands engage a lectin interaction, leading to a dense cross&#8208;linked multimeric complex formation. Whereas vesicles having the most or complete ligand constitution switch the lectin interaction to form a fully soluble monomeric complex, without a cross&#8208;linking. Nanomolar dissociation constants govern these interactions, as assessed by a ligand displacement assay. The study demonstrates the switching between monomeric and multimeric nature of the interaction as a function of ligand densities in the vesicles and the results are directly relevant to understand such a phenomenon occurring at the cell surfaces.</dc:description>

      <title>Characterization of a Mo&#8208;nitrogenase variant containing a citrate&#8208;substituted cofactor</title>
      <dc:description>Nitrogenase converts N  2  to NH  3  , and CO to hydrocarbons, at its cofactor site. Here, we report a biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of a Mo&#8208;nitrogenase variant expressed in an  Azotobacter vinelandii  strain containing a deletion of  nifV  , the gene encoding the homocitrate synthase. Designated NifDK  Cit  , the catalytic component of this Mo&#8208;nitrogenase variant contains a citrate&#8208;substituted cofactor analog. Activity analysis of NifDK  Cit  reveals a shift of CO&#8208;reduction from H  2  &#8208;evolution toward hydrocarbon&#8208;formation and an opposite shift of N  2  &#8208;reduction from NH  3  &#8208;formation toward H  2  &#8208;evolution. Consistent with a shift in the Mo K&#8208;edge energy of NifDK  Cit  relative to that of its wildtype counterpart, EPR analysis demonstrates a broadening of the line&#8208;shape and a decrease in the intensity of the cofactor&#8208;originated  S  = 3/2 signal, suggesting a change in the spin properties of the cofactor upon citrate substitution. These observations point to a crucial role of homocitrate in substrate reduction by nitrogenase and the possibility to tune product profiles of nitrogenase reactions via organic ligand substitution.</dc:description>

      <title>Simultaneous Visualization of Wet Cells and Nanostructured Biomaterials in SEM using Ionic Liquids</title>
      <dc:description>This work presents a successful methodology to image mammalian cells adhered to nanostructured titanium using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) operating in low&#8208;vacuum mode following ionic liquid treatment. Human osteoblast&#8208;like Saos&#8208;2 cells were treated with a room&#8208;temperature ionic liquid, 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, and subsequently imaged on titanium utilizing SEM. Titanium substrates were modified to create laser&#8208;induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) for visualizing at the sub&#8208;micron scale. Using a combination of fluorescence&#8208;based cell metabolism along with light microscopy and SEM image analysis, the shape and location of irradiated cells were confirmed to be unchanged after multiple irradiation sessions while the viability of minimally irradiated cells was unaltered. The wet imaging conditions combined with a rapid facile protocol using ionic liquid allows this technique to fulfill a niche in examining cellular behavior on biomaterials with sub&#8208;micron surface features. The demonstrated method to track observed cell adhesion to sub&#8208;micron surface features with SEM has great implications for the understanding of cell migration on nanostructured surfaces as well as on the exploration of simpler SEM preparation methods for cellular imaging.</dc:description>

      <title>Combining Inorganic Chemistry and Biology: The Underestimated Potential of Metal Complexes in Medicine</title>
      <dc:description>
Metals in medicine: Metal complexes offer unique properties in comparison to organic drugs. Herein, the generally underestimated potential of metal&#8208;containing compounds in comparison to organic compounds, as exemplified by photodynamic therapy, is highlighted.







Abstract
The vast majority of investigated compounds in modern medicine are based on organic molecules. Within the last decades, the field of medicinial chemistry is shifting towards the application of metal complexes. These compounds offer different mechanisms of action in comparison to organic molecules due to their unique properties, making them novel drug candidates. Herein, the successful combination of metal containing compounds and medicine is highlighted by their application for photodynamic therapy.

     alt="Combining Inorganic Chemistry and Biology: The Underestimated Potential of Metal Complexes in Medicine"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Metals in medicine&lt;/b&gt;: Metal complexes offer unique properties in comparison to organic drugs. Herein, the generally underestimated potential of metal&#8208;containing compounds in comparison to organic compounds, as exemplified by photodynamic therapy, is highlighted.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of investigated compounds in modern medicine are based on organic molecules. Within the last decades, the field of medicinial chemistry is shifting towards the application of metal complexes. These compounds offer different mechanisms of action in comparison to organic molecules due to their unique properties, making them novel drug candidates. Herein, the successful combination of metal containing compounds and medicine is highlighted by their application for photodynamic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid probes capable of cross&#8208;linking with DNA: Effects of terminal and internal modifications on cross&#8208;link efficiency</title>
      <dc:description>In this study, we describe a furan&#8208;modified acpcPNA as a probe that can form an interstrand cross&#8208;link (ICL) with its DNA target upon activation with N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS). To overcome the problem of the furan instability under acidic conditions, a simple and versatile post&#8208;synthetic methodology for the attachment of the furan group to the PNA probe is developed. Unlike other designs, the furan was placed at the end of the PNA molecule or tethered to the PNA backbone with all the base pairs in the PNA&#8208;DNA duplexes fully preserved. Hence, the true reactivity of each nucleobase towards the cross&#8208;linking could be compared. We show that all DNA bases except T could participate in the cross&#8208;linking reaction when the furan was placed at the end of the PNA strand. The cross&#8208;linking process was sensitive to mispairing, and lower cross&#8208;linking efficiency was observed in the presence of a base&#8208;mismatch in the PNA&#8208;DNA duplex. In contrast, when the furan was placed at the internal positions of the acpcPNA&#8208;DNA duplex, no ICL was observed which was explained by the inability of a hydrogen&#8208;bonded nucleobase to participate in the cross&#8208;linking reaction. The cross&#8208;linking efficiency was considerably improved, despite lower duplex stability, when an unpaired base (in the form of C&#8208;insertion) was present in the complementary DNA strand close to the furan modification site.</dc:description>

      <title>Discovery of the 2,4&#8242;&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;3&#8242;&#8208;methoxypropiophenone biosynthesis genes in Aspergillus oryzae</title>
      <dc:description>The filamentous fungus  Aspergillus oryzae  has 27 putative iterative type I polyketide synthase (PKS) gene clusters, but secondary metabolites produced by them are mostly unknown. Here, we focused on eight clusters which were reported to be expressed at relatively high levels in a transcriptome analysis. By comparison of metabolites between an octuple&#8208;deletion mutant of these eight PKS gene clusters and its parent strain, we found that  A. oryzae  produced 2,4&#8242;&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;3&#8242;&#8208;methoxypropiophenone (  1  ) and its precursor, 4&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8242;&#8208;methoxypropiophenone (  3  ), in a specific liquid medium. Furthermore, an iterative type I PKS (PpsB) encoded by AO090102000166 and an acetyl&#8208;CoA ligase (PpsA) encoded downstream from  ppsB  were shown to be essential for their biosynthesis. PpsC, encoded upstream from  ppsB  , was shown to have  3  &#8208;binding activity (  K  d  ; 26.0 &#177; 6.2 &#956;M) and is suggested to be involved in the conversion of  3  to  1  .

      <title>The &#8220;Carbonyl Story&#8221; and Beyond; Experiences, Lessons and Implications</title>
      <dc:description>
Lessons in discovery and development: The way to bring a 99mTc imaging agent into and through clinical trials is a long one. Although &#8220;carbonyl technology&#8221; has been known for almost two decades, only one compound made it that far. The different reasons for this are discussed in the paper together with scientific developments inspired by but beyond the carbonyl technology.







Abstract
The complex [99mTc(OH2)3(CO)3]+ has become a versatile building block in radiopharmaceutical chemistry, applied by many groups worldwide. However, despite widespread efforts, only one compound has made it right the way through clinical trials. Along the way from its discovery to its development into an eventual product, the author experienced issues that he would handle differently in retrospect. In this article, these experiences are turned into &#8220;lessons&#8221; that might be helpful for young researchers finding themselves in similar situations. Beside issues with patenting and company strategies, the carbonyl story has provided scientific implications beyond its own story, and insights from which any future 99mTc&#8208;based chemistry for radiopharmacy or molecular imaging might benefit.

      <title>Structural cues for understanding eEF1A2 moonlighting</title>
      <dc:description>Spontaneous mutations in the  EEF1A2  gene cause epilepsy and severe neurological disabilities in children.

In this new light, the role of eEF1A2 as an ancient, multifaceted, and articulated protein at the crossroads of autophagy, oncogenesis and viral replication appears very distant from the &#8220;canonical&#8221; one of delivering aminoacylated&#8208;tRNAs to the ribosome that has dominated the scene and much of the thinking for many decades.</dc:description>

      <title>Developments in mannose&#8208;based treatments for Uropathogenic Escherichia coli induced urinary tract infections</title>
      <dc:description>During their lifetime almost half of women will experience a symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) with a further half experiencing a relapse within six months.&#160;&#160;Currently UTIs are treated with antibiotics, but increasing antibiotic resistance rates highlight the need for new treatments. Uropathogenic&#160; Escherichia coli &#160;(UPEC) is responsible for the majority of symptomatic UTI cases and thus has become a key pathological target. Adhesion of type one pilus subunit FimH at the surface of UPEC strains to mannose&#8208;saturated oligosaccharides located on the urothelium is critical to&#160;&#160;pathogenesis. Since the identification of FimH as a therapeutic target in the late 1980s, a substantial body of research has been generated focusing on the development of FimH&#8208;targeting mannose&#8208;based anti&#8208;adhesion therapies. In this review we will discuss the design of different classes of these mannose&#8208;based compounds and their utility and potential as UPEC therapeutics.</dc:description>

      <title>A pyrimido&#8208;quinoxaline fused heterocycle lights up transfer RNA upon binding at the Mg2+ binding site</title>
      <dc:description>Transfer RNAs (tRNA) are fundamental molecules in cellular translation. In the present study we have highlighted a fluorescence&#8208;based perceptive approach for tRNA using quinoxaline small molecule. We have synthesized a water soluble fluorescent pyrimido&#8208;quinoxaline fused heterocycle containing a mandatory piperazine tail (  DS1  ) with a large stokes shift (~ 160 nm). The interaction between  DS1  and tRNA results in significant fluorescence enhancement of the molecule with a K  d  ~ 5 &#181;M and multiple binding sites. Our work reveals that  DS1  binding site overlaps with the specific Mg  2+  ion binding site in the D loop of tRNA. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the molecule inhibited Pb  2+  induced cleavage of yeast tRNA  Phe  in the D loop. In competitive binding assay, the fluorescence of DS1&#8208;tRNA complex is quenched by a known tRNA&#8208;binder, tobramycin. This indicates the displacement of  DS1  and indeed a substantiation of a specific binding at the site of tertiary interaction in the central region of tRNA. The ability of compound  DS1  to bind tRNA with higher affinity compared to DNA and single&#8208;stranded RNA offers a promising approach in developing tRNA based biomarker diagnostics in future.</dc:description>

      <title>Artificial enzymes for Diels&#8208;Alder reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reaction is a cycloaddition of a conjugated diene and an alkene (dienophile) leading to the formation of a cyclohexene derivative&#160;  via  &#160;a concerted mechanism.&#160; As DA reaction generally proceeds with a high degree of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, it is widely used in synthetic organic chemistry. &#160;Considering eco&#8208;conscious public and governmental movements, efforts are directed towards the development of industrial processes that meet environmental&#160; concern s. Artificial enzymes, that can be developed to catalyze abiotic reactions, appear as important synthetic tools of synthetic biology field. This review describes the different strategies used for developing protein &#8208;based artificial enzymes for DA reaction, including for&#160;  in cellulo  &#160;  or in vivo  &#160;approaches.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reaction is a cycloaddition of a conjugated diene and an alkene (dienophile) leading to the formation of a cyclohexene derivative&#160;  via  &#160;a concerted mechanism.&#160; As DA reaction generally proceeds with a high degree of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, it is widely used in synthetic organic chemistry. &#160;Considering eco&#8208;conscious public and governmental movements, efforts are directed towards the development of industrial processes that meet environmental&#160; concern s. Artificial enzymes, that can be developed to catalyze abiotic reactions, appear as important synthetic tools of synthetic biology field. This review describes the different strategies used for developing protein &#8208;based artificial enzymes for DA reaction, including for&#160;  in cellulo  &#160;  or in vivo  &#160;approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Enhancing Biosynthesis and Manipulating Flux in Whole Cells with Abiotic Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Metabolic engineering uses genetic strategies to drive flux through desired pathways. Recent work with electrochemical, photochemical, and chemocatalytic setups has revealed that these systems can also expand metabolic pathways and manipulate flux in whole cells. Electrochemical systems add or remove electrons from metabolic pathways to direct flux to more or less reduced products. Photochemical systems act as synthetic light harvesting complexes and yield artificial photosynthetic organisms. Biocompatible chemocatalysis increases product scope, streamlines syntheses, and yields single&#8208;flask processes that deliver products that would be challenging to synthesize through biosynthetic means alone. Here, we exclusively highlight systems that combine abiotic systems with living whole cells, taking particular note of strategies that enable the merger of these typically disparate systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Evaluation of i&#8208;Motif Formation in the Serotonin Transporter&#8208;Linked Polymorphic Region</title>
      <dc:description>Neuropsychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD) arise from a complex set of genetic and environmental factors. The serotonin transporter (SERT) is a key regulator of synaptic serotonin (5&#8208;HT) and its inhibition is an important pharmacological target for treating MDD. The serotonin transporter&#8208;linked polymorphic region (5&#8208;HTTLPR) contains two major variants (short and long) which have been implicated in modulating the susceptibility to MDD by altering the level of expression of SERT. Both variants contain C&#8208;rich repeats that conform to consensus i&#8208;motif folding sequences. i&#8208;Motifs are quadruplex DNA structures that have been proposed to have a role in transcriptional regulation. With spectroscopic techniques, we demonstrate that both alleles are able to form i&#8208;motifs at acidic pH, and at neutral pH under conditions of molecular crowding. This highlights the potential for i&#8208;motif formation to contribute to transcriptional regulation of the serotonin transporter, with a potential role in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.</dc:description>

      <title>Regulating CRISPR/Cas9 Function through Conditional Guide RNA Control</title>
      <dc:description>Conditional control of CRISPR/Cas9 has been developed using a variety of different approaches, many focusing on manipulation of the Cas9 protein itself. However, more recent strategies for governing CRISPR/Cas9 function are based on guide RNA (gRNA) modifications. They include control of gRNAs by light, small molecules, proteins, and oligonucleotides. These designs have unique advantages compared to other approaches and have allowed for precise regulation of gene editing and transcription.

      <title>Covalently Mercurated Molecular Beacon for Discriminating the Canonical Nucleobases</title>
      <dc:description>A highly nucleobase discriminating metalated nucleoside analog, 3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8208;mercuri&#8208;6&#8208;methylaniline, was incorporated into an oligonucleotide molecular beacon. Fluorescence emission spectra were measured after the addition of four different complementary strands, where the nucleobase opposite of the metalated analog varies. The fluorescence results showed a clear binding selectivity at room temperature, in the order G&gt;T&gt;C&gt;A. The selectivity is based on the different affinities between the metalated nucleoside analog and the canonical nucleobases. The synthesized probe is capable of robust discrimination between the two purine as well as the two pyrimidine bases by fluorescence at room temperature, and more sophisticated temperature analysis allows clear separation of every canonical nucleobase. The probe would, hence, be a suitable method for the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms.</dc:description>

However, the logic of their chemical diversity has rarely been explored. Here, we report the identification of three new (  2  ,  3  ,  8  ) and five known (  1  ,  4  &#8208;  7  ) epithiodiketopiperazines of this subtype from a marine&#8208;derived  Penicillium  sp. The structure elucidation was supported by multiple spectroscopic analyses. Importantly, we observed multiple nonenzymatic interconversions of these analogues in aqueous solutions and organic solvents. Furthermore, the same biosynthetic origin of these compounds was supported by one mined gene cluster. The dominant analogue (  1  ) demonstrated selective cytotoxicity to androgen&#8208;sensitive prostate cancer cells and HIF&#8208;depleted colorectal cells and mild antiaging activities, linking the bioactivity to oxidative stress.

      <title>Exploring epigenetic marks by analysis of non&#8208;covalent interactions</title>
      <dc:description>Epigenetic marks are modest chemical modifications on DNA and histone proteins that regulate the activation or silencing of genes, through modulation of the intermolecular interactions between the DNA strands and the protein machinery. The process is complex and not always well understood. One of the systems studied in greater detail is the epigenetic mark on H3K9: the lysine 9 of the histone 3. The degree of methylation or acetylation of this histone is linked to silencing or activation of the corresponding gene, but it is not clear which effect each mark has in gene expression. We shed light on this particular methylation process using density functional theory calculations (DFT) First, we built a model consisting of a DNA double strand containing three base pairs and a sequence of three amino acids of the histone&#8217;s tail. Then, we computed the modulation introduced in the intermolecular interactions by each epigenetic modification: from mono to tri&#8208;methylation and acetylation. The calculations show that while acetylation and tri&#8208;methylation results in a reduction of the DNA&#8208;peptide interaction; non&#8208;, mono&#8208;, and di&#8208;methylation increase the intermolecular interactions. Such observations compare well with the findings reported in the literature, highlighting the correlation between the balance of intermolecular forces and biological properties and advancing quantum mechanical studies of large biochemical systems at molecular level through the use of DFT methods.</dc:description>

      <title>Incorporation of halogenated amino acids into antibody fragments at multiple specific sites enhances antigen binding</title>
      <dc:description>The expansion of the amino&#8208;acid repertoire with synthetic derivatives introduces novel structures and functionalities into proteins. In the present study, we improved the antigen binding of antibodies by incorporating halogenated tyrosines at multiple selective sites. Tyrosines in the Fab fragment of an anti&#8208;EGF&#8208;receptor antibody 059&#8208;152 were systematically replaced with 3&#8208;bromo&#8208; and 3&#8208;chlorotyrosines, and simultaneous replacements at 4 specific sites were thus found to cause a 10&#8208;fold increase in the affinity toward the antigen. Structure modeling suggested that this effect was due to enhanced shape complementarity between the antigen and antibody molecules. On the other hand, we showed that chlorination in the constant domain, far from the binding interface, of Rituximab Fab also increased the affinity significantly (up to 17&#8208;fold). Our results showed that antigen binding is tunable with the halogenation&#160;in and out of the binding motifs.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A single&#8208;transaminase&#8208;catalyzed biocatalytic cascade was developed by employing a desired biocatalyst ATA&#8208;117&#8208;Rd11 that shows high activity toward 2&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;[(hydroxy)(methyl)phosphinoyl]butyric acid (PPO) and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate, and low activity against pyruvate. The cascade successfully promotes highly asymmetric amination reaction for synthesis of L&#8208;phosphinothricin (L&#8208;PPT) with high conversion (&amp;gt;95%) and &amp;gt; 99% e.e.. In the scale&#8208;up experiment, using 10 kg pre&#8208;frozen E. coli cells harboring ATA&#8208;117&#8208;Rd11, 80 kg PPO was converted to L&#8208;PPT within 24 hours yielding &#8776;70 kg L&#8208;PPT with a high e.e. value (&amp;gt;99%).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Trapping transient protein species by genetic code expansion</title>
      <dc:description>Nature employs a limited number of genetically encoded amino acids for the construction of functional proteins. By engineering components of the cellular translation machinery, however, it is now possible to genetically encode non&#8208;canonical building blocks with tailored electronic and structural properties, enabling facile chemical diversification of these biopolymers. The ability to incorporate unique chemical functionality into proteins provides a powerful tool to probe mechanism and create novel function. In this minireview, we highlight several recent studies that illustrate how non&#8208;canonical amino acids have been used to capture and characterize reactive intermediates, fine&#8208;tune the catalytic properties of enzymes, and stabilize short&#8208;lived protein&#8208;protein complexes.</dc:description>

      <title>Site Selective Peptide Macrocyclization</title>
      <dc:description>Cyclized peptides have seen a rise in popularity in the pharmaceutical industry as drug molecules. As such, new macrocyclization methodologies have become abundant in the last several decades. However, efficient methods of cyclization without the formation of side products have still remained a great challenge. Herein, we review the cyclization approaches that focus on site selective chemistry. Site selectivity in macrocyclization decreases the generation of side products, lending to a greater yield of desired peptide macrocycles. We will also take an in&#8208;depth look at the new exclusively intramolecular N&#8208;terminal site selective CyClick strategy for synthesis of cyclic peptides. The CyClick method utilizes imine formation between an aldehyde and the N&#8208;terminus. The imine is then trapped by a nucleophilic attack from the second amidic nitrogen in a non&#8208;reversible site selective fashion.</dc:description>

      <title>Using Mutability Landscapes to Guide Enzyme Thermostabilization</title>
      <dc:description>The thermostabilization of enzymes while retaining their activity and enantioselectivity for applied biocatalysis is an important topic in protein engineering. Rational and computational design strategies as well as directed evolution have been used successfully to thermostabilize enzymes. Here, we describe an alternative mutability&#8208;landscape approach that identified three single mutations (R11Y, R11I and A33D) within the enzyme 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT), which has potential as a biocatalyst for pharmaceutical synthesis, that gave rise to significant increases in apparent melting temperature  T  m  (up to 20 &#176;C) and in half&#8208;life at 80 &#176;C (up to 111&#8208;fold). Introduction of these beneficial mutations in an enantioselective but thermolabile 4&#8208;OT variant (M45Y/F50A) afforded improved triple&#8208;mutant enzyme variants showing an up to 39 &#176;C increase in  T  m  value, with no reduction in catalytic activity or enantioselectivity. This study illustrates the power of mutability&#8208;landscape&#8208;guided protein engineering for thermostabilizing enzymes.</dc:description>
